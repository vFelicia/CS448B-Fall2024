00:00 - all right here we are well hi everybody
00:04 - [Music]
00:06 - yes thank you for joining us today we're
00:11 - gonna get started with a recorded
00:14 - version of this webinar the background
00:19 - on that is that we wanted to make sure
00:20 - that we had all the relevant information
00:23 - for everybody without technical
00:25 - difficulties we're all at home my name
00:28 - is ELISA we're on the phone with Alex
00:31 - and sunny today Alex yeah hi I'm Alex
00:34 - curriculum developer at code Academy
00:37 - sunny and I have worked on putting
00:39 - together that blog post if you've seen
00:42 - that blog post about resources on how to
00:46 - work with coke atom e from home so
00:47 - that's a that's what we'll be talking
00:49 - about today a little bit yeah hello
00:53 - everybody I'm sunny I am currently
00:55 - wrapping up our learn Swift course with
00:58 - the learn Swift team and helping this
01:01 - gonna be a fun day yeah that blog post
01:06 - can be found at news dot code Kadim
01:08 - e.com
01:10 - that's gonna read as like a background I
01:14 - guess script go into some high-level
01:17 - information we're gonna go deeper in
01:20 - today so in just a moment we're gonna
01:23 - press play on the recording if you're
01:25 - watching this you'll see sunny Alex in
01:29 - my camera go away so we can all focus on
01:32 - the broadcast that we have for you and
01:35 - then as soon as that's over we're gonna
01:37 - pop back in and we'll do Q&A I am super
01:41 - excited about this I'm super ready for
01:45 - this thank you so much for already
01:48 - engaging with the poll that we just sent
01:50 - out yeah just some questions so we can
01:53 - know who we're chatting with today cool
01:57 - Wow Wow it looks like we've got some
01:59 - people who just signed up one thing I
02:03 - want to test before we dive in for real
02:07 - is are we able to send
02:12 - Q&A can somebody just tell us where
02:15 - you're calling in from so like let's
02:17 - test out this this question and answer
02:20 - let's see what we get I'm from Colorado
02:24 - Susan I'm from Colorado it works and
02:30 - work we also have chat oh yeah cool and
02:36 - then Michael the poems or I might may
02:41 - have to launch the poll uh yeah I think
02:45 - I think it's gonna be greedy I'm gonna
02:49 - be greedy and be the only one who can
02:50 - see though the Preferences so so far it
02:54 - looks like 71% of you just signed up but
02:58 - 29 have you been coding for a while Pat
03:00 - yourselves on the back that's really
03:01 - great everybody we have 86%
03:06 - students on the line with us today
03:09 - 29% teachers 29% parents those don't add
03:13 - up to hundred that's because you could
03:15 - choose multiple and holy smokes a
03:22 - hundred percent of respondents that are
03:25 - learning Python Wow okay that's also a
03:31 - multiple choice so we've got fifty
03:32 - percent of people in system only but
03:34 - thirty three percent into C++ thank you
03:37 - for filling out the poll it's super
03:38 - exciting to see this happen time okay so
03:40 - this is who we've got with us we've got
03:42 - people from Pakistan Germany Greece
03:44 - south central Idaho and people learning
03:49 - all kinds of stuff so this is gonna be
03:51 - good this is gonna be great I think that
03:53 - we are ready we're five minutes in let's
03:56 - yeah so as this video is playing we'll
03:59 - be we'll just turn it off our camera but
04:01 - we'll still be here so if you want to
04:02 - ask questions in the question panel as
04:05 - the video is going feel free to do that
04:07 - and answer them as the video is going or
04:10 - kind of back lock them for after the
04:12 - video and we can answer them on air
04:16 - let's cool let's keep the lines of
04:18 - communication open and we are about to
04:22 - get started
04:23 - three two one
04:28 - [Music]
04:31 - everyone thank you for joining us today
04:34 - my name is Alisa I'm calling today but
04:37 - codecademy we've got two of our
04:40 - curriculum developers online can't wait
04:42 - to introduce you to them we have sunny
04:45 - leave hello everybody
04:47 - sunny I'm on that curricula team and
04:49 - Alex Koontz and today's webinar is to
04:56 - help everyone who has recently signed up
05:00 - for a scholarship or recently signed up
05:02 - or Codecademy to be super successful and
05:05 - use this time to learn to code so this
05:10 - is an opportunity I think for someone on
05:13 - our team sunny has so much passion for
05:17 - what he does so I think I think sunny
05:20 - why don't why don't you tell us about
05:22 - like how this scholarship program and
05:24 - and what you're doing at Koch added me
05:27 - all just fit together with our mission
05:29 - oh sure
05:31 - so Co cami is essentially a leading
05:34 - online learning platform that teaches
05:36 - Peabody code in a very easy and fun way
05:39 - and we have courses on computer science
05:42 - web development mobile development game
05:45 - development and data science we have
05:47 - courses on 14 different languages that
05:49 - each include lessons quizzes projects
05:51 - articles videos and Co challenges and
05:54 - our mission behind all of this
05:58 - is that we are trying to empower people
06:00 - around the world to transform everyone's
06:03 - personal and professional lives by
06:05 - helping them learn - skills like coding
06:08 - and this is a very tough time as a
06:11 - former teacher I can't imagine what
06:14 - teachers and students are going through
06:16 - right now and we're trying us to to do
06:19 - everything that we can to support our
06:22 - student learners we believe that even
06:24 - though school may have been cancelled we
06:27 - hope that learning does not stop and on
06:31 - the term - Alex right now to go over
06:33 - we're going to cover today in this
06:34 - webinar yeah so along those lines we
06:39 - think that coke Adam II is
06:40 - a platform that people can really use to
06:43 - continue learning while they may be
06:45 - stuck at home and not going to school
06:46 - and so today we're kind of gonna go
06:49 - through how you might do that whether
06:50 - you're a teacher and you're looking to
06:52 - develop some curriculum for your
06:54 - students that are stuck at home or
06:56 - you're a student that is at home and
06:59 - might not know what to do or what
07:01 - resources to turn to the purpose of this
07:03 - webinar is to really kind of guide you
07:05 - to use Khan Academy to help you work so
07:09 - we're gonna go through what code Academy
07:12 - is so if you've never used code Academy
07:13 - before and you don't know what it is or
07:15 - how to use it we're gonna give you a
07:16 - little bit of a demo of one of our
07:19 - lessons we'll talk about the scholarship
07:22 - program that we just started and how you
07:24 - can use your dot edu or dot k12 email
07:28 - address to sign up for a free promo code
07:31 - and then after that we all specifically
07:34 - discuss for teachers and for students
07:37 - like what strategies might want to use
07:39 - to use our curriculum and help you out
07:41 - in your classroom so we can walk through
07:43 - maybe different lesson plans that you
07:45 - might be able to make so let's go and
07:47 - get started with that I guess we'll
07:50 - start and something you can somebody was
07:52 - the once actually write this course but
07:55 - this is kind of our bread and butter on
07:57 - coke Adam II this is a code Academy
07:59 - course this one happens to be learn
08:01 - Swift so a typical course will be
08:05 - between 30 30 and 45 minutes we say so
08:10 - me like I met around that size for a
08:12 - course and so you know a fairly good
08:15 - block if you want to assign an
08:17 - assignment of course might be a good a
08:19 - good unit to be able to assign for a day
08:23 - or for a couple of days and kind of the
08:25 - benefit of coke Adam II is like we have
08:28 - this interactive coding environment so
08:32 - this is a course that's teaching Swift
08:34 - which is a programming language and you
08:37 - can see that there's instruction here
08:39 - and there are some instructions or goals
08:41 - that the the student is trying to
08:44 - accomplish we have some hints I can show
08:46 - how they how they accomplish those and
08:49 - then over here we have our interactive
08:53 - coding
08:54 - section of the website so you can write
08:57 - code here you can run the code and see
09:01 - the results and so really the benefit of
09:04 - code Academy is that it's all right
09:07 - there for you on the website you don't
09:09 - have to do any work to set things up
09:11 - outside of a website you literally just
09:13 - go to one of these courses and we've got
09:15 - you know this text editor where you can
09:17 - start writing code and some of the cool
09:21 - things about our learning environment is
09:23 - that we have a cloud navigation system
09:26 - so right on top of the co-editor you can
09:30 - actually manipulate different files the
09:33 - file names is also at the top and on the
09:36 - right hand side that's what's called a
09:38 - terminal this is where your when you
09:41 - type code and the co-editor the output
09:44 - will be displayed in the black box so
09:47 - you can see you know we're doing some
09:49 - simple coding here or we're adding one
09:51 - plus one but as you walk through these
09:53 - lessons things will get more complicated
09:55 - and in this case you would learn all
09:58 - about the programming language Swift so
10:01 - that's kind of the basic basic stuff
10:03 - like what code catta me is essentially
10:05 - it is curriculum about coding where you
10:08 - get to code along as you're learning
10:10 - next we wanted to talk a little bit
10:12 - about the scholarship itself so we're
10:18 - offering the scholarships to students
10:20 - and teachers that have education email
10:23 - addresses so you know that end in dot
10:26 - edu or dot k12 you'll see down here in
10:29 - the frequently asked questions if you
10:31 - are a student or our teacher and don't
10:34 - have one of those email addresses you
10:36 - can fill out this form and we'll try to
10:38 - get you one of these scholarships
10:40 - anyways so essentially what this
10:43 - scholarship is is access to more every
10:47 - bit of curriculum on our site so if you
10:50 - click here to join pro on this page is
10:53 - where you would sign up with that dot
10:57 - edu or dot k12 email account and so I'll
11:01 - do I'll sign up with my own
11:09 - University email account
11:11 - hello Carleton people and if we go and
11:16 - say start coming out we also gotta do a
11:18 - CAPTCHA identify some motorcycles hmm
11:22 - fun cool so we you just signed up for or
11:28 - we just signed up for an account there's
11:31 - a little bit of onboarding if you want
11:32 - some course recommendations things like
11:35 - that but instead of doing that we can
11:37 - just jump to the catalog and Sonny do
11:40 - you want to talk a little bit about what
11:43 - people can do now that they have one of
11:45 - these scholarships and one of these pro
11:47 - accounts what maybe I'm doing the
11:48 - catalog kami
11:49 - has 14 different programming languages
11:52 - if you count some of the market
11:54 - languages like HTML CSS and SAS with the
11:58 - scholarship and lots pretty much all the
12:00 - content and courses in our catalog so
12:03 - with the pro search screen you have pro
12:04 - courses you have something called skill
12:07 - path which essentially teaches a skill
12:09 - using a basic language and you also have
12:13 - career paths such as web dental and path
12:15 - in computer science path data science
12:18 - path almost once long of curriculum yeah
12:22 - these these paths are cute which I would
12:24 - say you know three four months minimum
12:27 - we would take to get through some of
12:29 - these fads
12:29 - yeah about past that you can actually
12:31 - start from not knowing any code not
12:34 - having write in any code and we just
12:36 - kind of built you up from there yeah
12:39 - yeah but so to be clear when you sign up
12:42 - using these scholarships you'll see that
12:43 - this is the account that I just I just
12:46 - created using one of those edu accounts
12:49 - and you'll see that it is a coke at me
12:51 - Pro account so when you sign up using
12:53 - these scholarships you have access to
12:55 - literally every single piece of content
12:57 - that we have on the site so any of these
12:59 - chrome courses that you might be
13:01 - interested in taking skill pouts
13:03 - you'll have access to to any of those
13:06 - these scholarships are for 90 days we as
13:10 - of now we're having these runs through
13:13 - the what the traditional school year
13:15 - would be so at the end of those 90 days
13:17 - your account won't be the activator in
13:19 - it or anything
13:20 - you won't just
13:21 - no longer have access to these core
13:23 - courses a question if I were a teacher
13:28 - how would I go about sharing with my
13:33 - class what they can do or should do yes
13:36 - so Sonny and I were both teachers
13:38 - somebody if you were a teacher and you
13:41 - had to figure out curriculum how would
13:43 - you use Khan Academy to to do that yeah
13:46 - so the first thing I try to pinpoint is
13:48 - what the class like to do in this
13:51 - downtown some of the students and I want
13:53 - to build a web app they might want to
13:55 - build a mobile absolutely I want to
13:57 - build a create like a data visualization
13:59 - a chatbot so basically first I'll
14:02 - pinpoint their experience level their
14:04 - interests their grade level and create a
14:07 - lesson plan based on that by picking a
14:09 - course or skill path or a clear path and
14:12 - create a weekly calendar with our
14:14 - monthly calendar for the class to follow
14:16 - trying to you know make the students
14:19 - stay engaged in this time I'll probably
14:21 - post weekly discussions weekly check-ins
14:23 - with the students another thing that I
14:26 - love to do is building team projects so
14:29 - after every you know a couple of modules
14:32 - it's on code Academy have students split
14:35 - up into different groups that have you
14:37 - know design something that wanted note
14:40 - and kind of just let them go for it yeah
14:44 - I think if we so I just clicked into the
14:48 - Java course
14:50 - Java's the language that AP Computer
14:53 - Science and sought in so this might be
14:54 - relevant to some teachers out there if
14:59 - we go into the learn Java course and
15:01 - take a look at the syllabus you can see
15:03 - the way that we've broken down the
15:04 - content is into fairly manageable chunks
15:07 - where again anything marked as a lesson
15:09 - is probably 30 to 45 minutes of content
15:14 - introduction so let's see if we go down
15:17 - the loops chapter this this lesson on
15:20 - loops will be introducing the concept of
15:22 - what is a loop you don't have you know
15:25 - that guided practice again working in
15:27 - the interactive coding terminal you can
15:30 - jump in here and look at that it's a
15:33 - links
15:36 - but again so we teach what the concept
15:39 - of loop is students are going to be able
15:42 - to practice it and you know pass these
15:44 - means challenges or checkpoints so in
15:48 - general I would say a lesson is kind of
15:51 - equivalent to a 45-minute class that you
15:54 - might have you know during a normal
15:57 - school day we also have these quizzes
15:59 - which are a little bit shorter those
16:00 - only usually be 10 to 15 multiple-choice
16:03 - questions about that topic that they
16:05 - just learned so that's a good check for
16:07 - understanding at the after students have
16:10 - completed the lesson and then projects
16:12 - which is a content type that we haven't
16:14 - really talked about yet again that is
16:17 - similar to a lesson in that they're
16:20 - gonna be coding right on the code
16:21 - Academy platform what is this this is
16:23 - fizzbuzz right there are a number of
16:26 - tasks that students will be asked to do
16:30 - and again they'll be coding right in the
16:34 - text editor right here but the idea
16:37 - behind projects is that they're a little
16:38 - bit more self-guided and independent and
16:41 - students are asked to apply the skills
16:43 - that they just learned rather than
16:44 - learning the skills for the first time
16:46 - so if I were a teacher I would really I
16:49 - would probably organize my curriculum
16:52 - around okay we're gonna do an
16:55 - interactive lesson we learn new material
16:57 - we're gonna do a project that code
17:00 - Academy gave us where you're building
17:03 - something from scratch and then I would
17:04 - probably also challenge them my students
17:07 - to expand upon those projects and so
17:11 - that's probably what I would do if I
17:12 - were a teacher where I would go through
17:14 - the go through the lessons try the
17:15 - projects and then ask my students to
17:18 - expand on on the project's themselves
17:21 - which is maybe a good place for
17:23 - collaboration or like pair programming
17:26 - yeah and that's another way you can also
17:29 - divide up the curriculum is just maybe
17:32 - one module a day it might be a lot for
17:34 - beginners but I think it's easily doable
17:38 - within an hour yeah the module is one of
17:41 - these kind of collapsible sections so
17:43 - this is the module an array an ArrayList
17:45 - yeah I would say
17:49 - I would say maybe an hour and a half two
17:51 - hours for a module depends on how he can
17:54 - really want to dive into it yeah but I
17:57 - could definitely see that the probe is
17:59 - that you have every student share the
18:03 - same progress right so you can have nice
18:05 - end of the week discussions or you know
18:07 - have a point where you can all build a
18:08 - project together yeah for it for student
18:13 - for students if you don't have a teacher
18:15 - that's supplying you curriculum right if
18:17 - you're just a student that signed up for
18:19 - wannabe scholarships and you just got
18:21 - here and you're wondering what to do I
18:23 - probably get going to the catalog I
18:26 - probably would look at these career
18:27 - paths these are really long sections of
18:30 - content where Sonny and I were talking
18:32 - about this earlier where it might take
18:33 - three or four months to complete this
18:36 - but take a look at these see what you
18:39 - might be interested in whether it's
18:41 - building websites whether it's doing
18:43 - more kind of computer science theory the
18:46 - computer science tool path is pretty
18:48 - similar to what you might see in intro
18:50 - college-level courses or the first
18:52 - college-level courses or the data
18:55 - science don't path also if you're
18:57 - interested in analyzing data visualizing
18:59 - data all that all that kind of stuff you
19:02 - scopa sorry yeah no I just took a
19:05 - question if if I am a student how much
19:10 - experience do I need to have yeah so for
19:15 - these skill paths you can start
19:16 - completely from scratch you definitely
19:18 - don't need any experience we build them
19:20 - in such a way that we start you from the
19:22 - very beginning and we get you to a point
19:24 - where you're building something pretty
19:26 - cool so that that's a that's a really
19:30 - good place to start the the courses in
19:34 - the catalog vary there are some you know
19:38 - recommended that skills that you should
19:40 - already have like the machine learning
19:43 - course for example is fairly complex so
19:45 - you should be familiar with with a
19:47 - handful and things people are going into
19:49 - there but in general these skill paths
19:51 - you can start from absolutely no
19:53 - programming experience we will build it
19:55 - completely from the ground up and and
19:57 - there's so much content in there that by
19:59 - the end of it you're building some
20:00 - pretty cool stuff you know
20:02 - but remember one thing that if you're a
20:04 - student that you should do is try to
20:05 - pinpoint what you want to build
20:07 - now help you pick the right course we
20:10 - also kind of develop this course
20:12 - recommendation that we broke down as a
20:14 - freaking team that kind of divides up
20:16 - our catalog by education level so you
20:19 - should definitely check that out yeah
20:24 - yeah
20:30 - it's a great idea to take notes while
20:33 - you're taking a course so you can you
20:35 - know look back while you're doing the
20:37 - the project we also offered two sheets
20:39 - now to help you retain the knowledge
20:42 - that you're learning especially the
20:43 - syntax and we'll love for you to think
20:49 - about things they can build doing this
20:52 - specific time we already seen a couple
20:54 - really cool projects I think 100 workers
20:56 - Zoey's strike this out she sent this
20:59 - really cool little web app it's called
21:01 - do not touch it face essentially uses a
21:04 - webcam and a machine learning algorithm
21:06 - to to remind people alert people do not
21:09 - touch their faces buddies find your
21:14 - friends your classmates and try to you
21:17 - know appear fresh and get started with
21:19 - you and you know something cool together
21:22 - that's like one of the beauty of you
21:25 - know tech right now yeah so I think
21:30 - that's about it Lisa do you have
21:31 - anything else that you want to talk
21:33 - about no I think that this was fantastic
21:38 - I think that we covered the basics of
21:41 - how to get started with a scholarship or
21:44 - without one really I feel like this
21:47 - answers questions for a lot of people I
21:49 - think one of the first questions that I
21:53 - know in the community we see people ask
21:56 - is like where do I get help how it's
22:00 - gonna help me get unstuck I think we put
22:03 - together or you all put together a good
22:05 - list actually if that's something that
22:08 - we could show thank you yeah the piece
22:13 - or section me yes the
22:16 - yeah sure sure sure yes yes yes right we
22:21 - talked about teachers the students yeah
22:24 - so here are additional resources the
22:26 - coke atom II community so discuss that
22:29 - code Kathleen dot-com we say you do a
22:32 - ton of work over here if you want to
22:33 - talk a little bit about what's going on
22:35 - here
22:37 - sure yeah this is the space to come when
22:40 - you get stuck not if because that's part
22:48 - of it that's what that's what the
22:49 - learning is this space is actually
22:52 - completely monitored and moderated by a
22:56 - group of volunteers you'll most likely
22:59 - interact with them and our awesome
23:03 - teammate will is in here too answering
23:06 - questions all the time so this is a good
23:07 - place to go I am particularly fond of
23:10 - the rest of the work that you all put
23:11 - together too because there's an entire
23:15 - world adjacent to coke atom II and ways
23:18 - to learn too yeah so there's there's a
23:22 - bunch of really great YouTube channels
23:25 - that teach me how to code my personal
23:28 - favorite is the coding training which is
23:32 - NYU professor he does kind of similar
23:38 - bite-sized coding exercises where he'll
23:41 - go through he teaches you how to build
23:43 - the snake game in around a half hour so
23:47 - even if you're not super experienced
23:49 - from a river yet I find that just
23:51 - watching people code and hearing them
23:53 - talk and seeing their thought process
23:55 - can be really helpful and as as he's
23:57 - going through these projects you might
23:59 - have ideas on how to change it a little
24:01 - bit or things that you might want to add
24:02 - that he didn't add so I really love
24:04 - specifically the coding train but
24:06 - they're a ton of really good YouTube
24:09 - resources out there as well we also
24:13 - added in oh yeah this is a great blog
24:15 - post how to start a group project
24:17 - collaboration is super important in
24:19 - coding and then this little piece just
24:21 - helps you get started yeah we'll try to
24:24 - get these links out to you but you can
24:25 - always look through our blog or Google
24:29 - how mister
24:29 - project wink at me and you should be
24:31 - able to find this finance blog post and
24:35 - then hacker ranking leak these two are
24:38 - really great platforms that can help
24:40 - keep your coding skills sharp by you
24:43 - know having these little code challenges
24:45 - that are great for the data structure
24:47 - and algorithm problems for technical
24:50 - interviews I think it's super nice to
24:52 - have something like this to do you know
24:55 - ten minutes a day 20 minutes day 30
24:56 - minutes a day yeah I think these two
24:59 - don't don't focus a ton on introducing
25:02 - new concepts but if you already have a
25:05 - little bit of programming experience and
25:06 - you want some basically you want a 15
25:09 - minute problem to wrap your mind around
25:12 - and test out your coding skills both of
25:14 - these are really great resources for
25:16 - that oh yeah another one is the COO
25:18 - Cammy app the code can we go yeah yeah I
25:21 - forgot to put that one on
25:22 - that one's just our mobile app that has
25:24 - also bite-sized flashcards and while
25:29 - you're you know on Instagram while Jason
25:31 - or he could just you know that dude's
25:34 - coding for 10 minutes there's there's
25:38 - less you know typing code on that app
25:43 - just because that's a that's a pretty
25:45 - lousy experience fee writing out a bunch
25:47 - of a bunch of code on the app but a lot
25:50 - of really great review cards and like
25:54 - multiple-choice questions kind of quiz
25:55 - questions type things so yeah yeah is a
25:59 - good resource as well that's good I
26:01 - think what what all of these resources
26:04 - here have in common with code Academy
26:07 - Pro is that they're an opportunity to
26:10 - practice I think something that's really
26:12 - important to call some attention to is
26:14 - that code Academy is open to everybody
26:17 - and so much there's so much you can
26:20 - learn for free with code Academy Pro and
26:24 - this scholarship you get the opportunity
26:26 - to practice and I'll leave it to Alex
26:31 - and Sonny the actual educators here of
26:34 - the power of practice but when we want
26:40 - to actually make sure that we are
26:41 - cementing something
26:42 - we want to dive in and that's what we're
26:46 - we're really excited to be able to offer
26:48 - right now yeah I think you said it well
26:53 - yeah we know there are little features
26:56 - we have streets so uh with everyone
26:59 - everyone you know not necessarily going
27:02 - to school every day we could see some
27:04 - high streets up on our platform people
27:08 - logging in every day and we do a lesson
27:09 - or two now we were talking about
27:12 - potentially putting together a leader
27:14 - board yeah that'd be great
27:16 - I don't I don't know what the what the
27:17 - biggest streak we've ever had is but be
27:20 - fun to fun to find out uh yeah that's
27:23 - something that we can we can learn I
27:25 - don't know if that's I don't over
27:26 - promise there's an exciting time to see
27:30 - how many consecutive days I do think we
27:33 - will get a you know increased street
27:35 - numbers on each other all right
27:38 - this was super and super informative and
27:42 - I am really looking forward to sharing
27:45 - this with educators and students who are
27:49 - looking for something like this there
27:54 - should be an opportunity either on the
27:57 - Facebook post where this resource is
27:59 - shared or if you can't find an
28:04 - opportunity to write a comment on this
28:07 - webcast join us in the forums and
28:11 - definitely find the space that we've
28:13 - created just for students and teachers
28:14 - here ask questions Alex and Sonny don't
28:19 - want to speak for you but this is great
28:31 - I think that let's in fact just one last
28:36 - time and land on that Thank You page
28:39 - because that's what we really mean here
28:43 - a giant thank you for sticking with us
28:46 - today and for learning with us all right
28:52 - good luck out there
28:54 - you
28:59 - alright alright there we go we're here
29:08 - looking to share video okay cool
29:19 - we've got some questions there are some
29:22 - questions that came through for you
29:24 - Sonny and Alex it's just super exciting
29:29 - let's start with do you provide the full
29:32 - courses of all the languages are just
29:34 - the basics this is multiple answers here
29:39 - yeah so I would say that some languages
29:44 - are just the basics and some languages
29:46 - have a lot of content kind of our newer
29:48 - material is covering the basics although
29:51 - you know we go fairly far into into the
29:53 - details I think you can speak more to
29:56 - that like Swift is one of our newer
29:58 - languages how would you say how far into
30:02 - like basic Swift do you guys good yeah
30:04 - I'll say we teach probably all the
30:06 - fundamentals of Swift before so the
30:11 - large sort of course basically teaches
30:12 - the language rather than to just like
30:13 - how to build an iOS app but we are
30:16 - thinking about building a skill path or
30:18 - career path on iOS curriculum very soon
30:22 - so that will take you there and and
30:25 - we're trying to do that we try to like
30:27 - model that around how our Python content
30:33 - works right now so in the learn Python 3
30:35 - course you're learning the basics of the
30:36 - language but you know you able to take
30:39 - that and learn different skills and
30:43 - skill paths like you know you'd learn
30:44 - about all the different Python packages
30:46 - and libraries such as matplotlib for
30:49 - 2-dimensional data visualizations you
30:55 - learn about psyche learn package in the
30:58 - machine learning skill path and that
31:00 - will teaches you how to do some basic
31:02 - supervisor and supervised learning using
31:05 - the package we teach another really fun
31:09 - one is the beautiful
31:10 - library that helps you web scrape
31:14 - pulling data from different websites
31:17 - what else do we got for Python yeah
31:21 - basically I would say take a look at the
31:24 - career paths which here maybe I can
31:27 - share my screen just so I can show this
31:29 - once we talk about it cool by the way
31:37 - this is the perfect time to ask any
31:38 - questions we're here to answer okay we
31:42 - have we have ten in the queue right now
31:44 - okay I'm excited to see what Alex has
31:47 - this year I'm just gonna pull up the
31:49 - show the career paths which are kind of
31:51 - our longest who actually want me give me
31:59 - a second to screen share I need to log
32:00 - into my cup cami account let's answer
32:03 - another question yeah so we got a
32:06 - question from Faruk Mohammed can
32:09 - enunciate enjoin these courses
32:10 - absolutely most of our courses a lot of
32:13 - our courses actually help you get
32:15 - started from scratch so you don't need a
32:16 - CS degree or you don't need to take have
32:19 - taken is yes programming course to start
32:22 - on co-captains yeah I'm also and
32:34 - actually I think this can be a twofer
32:36 - once Alex hits his screen setup there's
32:38 - one from Irene whoo if I were interested
32:41 - in following two career paths at the
32:43 - same time oh there we go
32:47 - what sort of daily schedule would you
32:49 - recommend to complete both in three to
32:52 - five months complete both yeah so that's
32:55 - which - I don't know if Irene you're
32:58 - still in the in the stream but can you
33:01 - let us know which two career paths that
33:05 - you're taking right now because that
33:06 - might answer might be different web de
33:08 - and see us thanks Irene is super quick
33:11 - okay so web dev and CSR both are two of
33:15 - our probably longest paths
33:17 - career paths that we have
33:25 - it's it's definitely gonna be very tough
33:29 - to do both in let's say four or five
33:32 - months but if you do want to take that
33:35 - route which is which is possible I'll
33:38 - say you probably have to be coding
33:39 - learning every single day I'll say one
33:42 - module a day seems one module to two
33:44 - modules days seems about right
33:46 - yeah those paths are pretty big I would
33:48 - say one of the so I worked a lot on the
33:52 - data science career path and I think
33:54 - that one is equally as big as its
33:56 - computer science and web dev and I would
33:58 - say I would ask to meet like six to nine
34:00 - months to complete the data science path
34:02 - you know if you're coding you know if
34:06 - you're coding it for five or ten hours a
34:09 - week I would say it would take six to
34:12 - six to nine months yeah but it's doable
34:16 - it is doable but yeah and I also think
34:18 - is cool to be jumping between career
34:21 - paths where you're definitely learning
34:22 - different skills and you can start to
34:24 - see similarities between languages that
34:26 - pop up in those different paths okay I
34:35 - have another question yeah and you guys
34:45 - you can you can see past that would be
34:46 - okay I'm a first year computer science
34:49 - student I want to specialize in
34:50 - cybersecurity and AI what is the best
34:53 - programming language to master for these
34:55 - two subjects I already know Java and
34:57 - Python which one would be more helpful
34:59 - on my case yeah a Python is definitely
35:03 - my programming language of choice and I
35:07 - think that that's a great one to use for
35:09 - AI and cybersecurity stuff we have a
35:13 - little bit of AI content on coke Adam II
35:15 - and all of that is in Python there are a
35:20 - lot of really great Python libraries for
35:22 - doing machine learning and AI stuff um
35:25 - so that's a good place to start and as
35:28 - you get further further along into it
35:30 - you might do you might dive into some
35:33 - other languages but I would say Python
35:35 - is a good place to start you
35:36 - yeah just to name a few libraries for
35:38 - Python in terms of AI tensorflow is
35:41 - great for machine learning
35:42 - Carris is great if you're you know free
35:45 - open-source library well tensorflow is
35:47 - free open source but Chara's it's great
35:51 - if you're interested in learning deep
35:52 - learning
35:52 - I'm secular and we teach that and the
35:54 - gift started with machine learning and
35:56 - in the data science path course that
35:57 - also is a nice package to help with like
35:59 - the basics of machine learning yeah try
36:03 - to I don't know if I've ever talked to a
36:08 - learner who took the AI course that we
36:13 - have mmm that I wrote and I really love
36:15 - feedback on that so I so give that one a
36:19 - shot if you're an AI students I would
36:20 - love to hear what you think about it
36:25 - thank you
36:27 - I think that it's just I think we
36:30 - already answered this but I think it's
36:31 - also worth repeating oh we did with
36:34 - Farooq let's just put this in stone
36:37 - cannon on C a student join these courses
36:41 - yeah in terms of whether you can join
36:45 - the yeah so as long as you have a dot
36:55 - edu or dot k12 email account you can get
36:57 - one of these scholarships will post the
36:59 - we'll post the link to the scholarship
37:02 - page all over the place I'll post in the
37:04 - chat in a second but as long as you have
37:06 - one of those email accounts you can sign
37:08 - up for a scholarship it doesn't matter
37:09 - if you're a student or a humanities
37:11 - student or whatever it you can get it no
37:13 - matter what if you don't have a dot edu
37:16 - or k12 email account we have a form that
37:19 - you can fill out and we'll hopefully be
37:20 - able to get you set up with that as well
37:22 - it might take a day or two to get that
37:25 - set up but I'm trying to get you an
37:27 - account yeah there's there's another
37:32 - question I think it's been here awhile
37:34 - from Deepika will you introduce more
37:37 - languages like C sharp or etc yeah so we
37:42 - actually already have a c-sharp course
37:43 - that we recently released I'll say few
37:46 - months ago and we are currently working
37:48 - on ASP
37:50 - skill path that our co-worker Nick is
37:52 - working on so it will be out in the
37:54 - upcoming months very soon
37:59 - and then we have another question from
38:03 - Troy thanks so each student needs to
38:05 - fill out a form question mark can you
38:06 - tell me how to assign things through
38:08 - Google classroom and check student's
38:09 - progress I have used Google classroom
38:12 - before the UX is for dental volunteer
38:16 - work at a co nation on that you school
38:20 - classroom and the UX is kind of
38:22 - complicated I don't know if you used it
38:24 - before else but it will be very
38:26 - difficult to teach that in this webinar
38:28 - so so unfortunately on code Academy we
38:31 - don't have something that like lets a
38:33 - teacher you know say that these 13
38:36 - accounts or my students accounts and
38:38 - like let me look at all their progress
38:39 - we don't have anything right now that
38:40 - lets us do that I've seen that we
38:42 - request a couple of times just in this
38:44 - in this webinar so that's a good thing
38:46 - to note that that's something that you
38:49 - all are asking for when I was the
38:52 - classroom teacher I use code Academy and
38:54 - it's not super graceful but you can
38:57 - definitely basically I had I have my
39:00 - students like screenshot their their
39:02 - progress really yeah right because
39:05 - especially because our UI shows like you
39:09 - know that they're what what quizzes
39:11 - they've taken what modules they've taken
39:13 - okay so it's not super graceful but
39:16 - that's like something that you can do to
39:18 - check that project and have that be
39:20 - submissions I suppose you can also have
39:25 - them I don't know something you have any
39:27 - other advice on how you can track it
39:31 - check in on students and see how they're
39:33 - doing I mean one way that you know we we
39:36 - talked about this in video but it would
39:38 - be nice to have students work on team
39:40 - projects together like prayer Broga
39:42 - prayer program together so after you
39:45 - know every one module two modules you
39:46 - have students work on you know basically
39:49 - submit the code or like the folder zip
39:53 - file or the output like if you actually
39:57 - post it somewhere on github or somewhere
39:59 - of the code itself so that's like
40:01 - another way to check proper to see that
40:02 - they actually understood the material
40:03 - applied it to their own personal
40:06 - projects yes some of these some of these
40:10 - skill pounds have I know exist have off
40:16 - platform projects which basically means
40:22 - their products that instruct students or
40:26 - whoever is taking the course to download
40:29 - code themselves working on it on their
40:32 - own machine rather than on the code
40:34 - cottony website and so something like
40:36 - that would be fairly easy to first for a
40:40 - teacher to be able to check in on
40:42 - because the students are downloading the
40:44 - code themselves and working at on
40:45 - working on the code on their own machine
40:47 - they can just send you those files so
40:50 - maybe an op off platform project like
40:53 - this one where you actually go and
40:54 - download the code instead of working on
40:56 - it on Co Academy that might be a little
40:59 - bit easier for teachers that are looking
41:00 - to like checking on students okay I hope
41:05 - there's some like really good questions
41:07 - coming through now I'm not so sure that
41:12 - we got to this one but this is probably
41:16 - the most popular question I see asked in
41:18 - the community forums is if I want to be
41:20 - job ready with Jessica ketamine will
41:22 - that be enough the question goes on to
41:27 - say that I know I want your view and
41:32 - your advice and by the way I'm already
41:33 - focusing on a web development path okay
41:36 - we could yeah we get that question a lot
41:38 - so I mean you want to take that I think
41:40 - you might know the end of web
41:42 - development path better than I do yeah
41:43 - so I think I mean the goal of code Cammy
41:47 - at least on the curriculum team is try
41:48 - to build something that's a almost like
41:51 - a one-stop shop where you can come to
41:53 - cook at me you know finish a career path
41:55 - and be job ready but I do think that
41:58 - it's important to go off platform a lot
42:01 - of times to seek out resources wherever
42:05 - you can so as you're taking a course on
42:10 - code Academy I highly suggest to take
42:12 - know
42:13 - even though you don't you know sometimes
42:15 - you don't look back on your notes it's
42:16 - good to it's a way to retain information
42:19 - I'll also try to build a lot of
42:24 - portfolio projects right like use the
42:27 - Codecademy projects the prompt to build
42:30 - something euro and I will try to join
42:34 - different communities like the code
42:35 - Academy community on Facebook and
42:37 - mobilize I'll try to join Twitter follow
42:41 - all my favorite RIT you know a lot of
42:43 - like well-known developers I would try
42:45 - to join deaf too
42:46 - you know just just a talk code right and
42:50 - and you know once you're done with the
42:53 - one on path you should definitely take
42:54 - that data stretch and algorithms any of
42:55 - you prep on code kami for JavaScript and
42:58 - that should be able to and just network
43:02 - but there are a lot of things that you
43:04 - should do I think I'm gonna write a blog
43:07 - post on this later on to to to you know
43:09 - make the the programming journey and
43:11 - more a whole a whole London
43:14 - yeah echo what you said sunny I think
43:17 - like the number one thing is probably to
43:19 - build a portfolio or a personal website
43:21 - or github someplace where you can show
43:24 - the work that you have done and so the
43:27 - way that you can use CAD imme to do that
43:29 - is to like take the take the off
43:32 - platform project seriously right where
43:34 - if there's if there's an off platform
43:36 - project that asks you to download code
43:38 - and work on it on your own machine
43:39 - really make sure that you are like
43:41 - comfortable doing that and then once you
43:43 - are comfortable doing that I would even
43:44 - recommend like you know if you're
43:46 - working on a project that's on code
43:48 - Academy on the website you can do it on
43:50 - the website but then I would we can say
43:51 - grab that code throw it into your code
43:55 - editor on your own computer and um you
44:01 - know expands on that project do stretch
44:03 - goals new challenges things like that
44:05 - and kind of trying to turn it into your
44:06 - own thing and then that can be a part of
44:08 - your portfolio or website or or
44:10 - something like that but you basically
44:12 - just like have to be able to show your
44:14 - code somewhere show can also talk code
44:17 - that's a very underrated skill to write
44:19 - to chat like to talk about programming
44:22 - and I also think this is a great time to
44:25 - I mean it's a down time right it's good
44:28 - time to reset and work on things that
44:30 - we're just like tackle things that
44:32 - you've never tried before with coding
44:33 - there are a lot of virtual hackathons
44:35 - going on right now that you could take a
44:37 - look a lot of them are Cove in nineteen
44:39 - related but I highly suggest you to join
44:43 - one you know find a team and come out
44:45 - with the project next question yeah Alex
44:53 - you're still sharing screen sure I can
44:55 - stop wait so this event is like this is
45:02 - another one that I want to touch on
45:03 - because it's such a common one I'm
45:06 - having a hard time choosing the kind of
45:09 - path I need to take hmm when I start a
45:12 - path I can't focus on it because I'm not
45:14 - really sure if it's the right one for me
45:16 - how can I fix that yeah I mean this is a
45:24 - great question I feel like you're gonna
45:25 - give this question it doesn't matter
45:26 - which career path career industry that
45:30 - you're in is this thing for me I've
45:32 - definitely run into that problem a lot
45:34 - because I'm somebody who's interested Oh
45:36 - a lot of things that means we are I'm
45:39 - interested mobile I'm interested in
45:40 - creative coding I'm interested in
45:41 - hardware but I suggest that you just try
45:47 - a bunch of things right before
45:48 - committing to a career path definitely
45:51 - learn some of the fundamentals right
45:53 - like a1 learn X course so you understand
45:55 - the fundamentals of programming and you
45:58 - can use that take that with you whenever
46:01 - you decide whichever career path that
46:04 - you want to take and also I like to
46:06 - pinpoint I think that you should
46:08 - pinpoint which what kind of things that
46:11 - you want to work on right I think that's
46:14 - a very important thing do you want to
46:15 - build a bit of a position do you want to
46:17 - build a Twitter bod you want to build
46:18 - this Square bot do you want to build a
46:20 - heart where projects do you want to work
46:23 - on well the lab web app desktop apps
46:25 - front-end back-end do want to work with
46:28 - data like sequel our Python so you got a
46:32 - pin point you know the things they text
46:34 - you like that makes you that you enjoy
46:39 - before you know and you don't have to
46:43 - commit on anything right you can just
46:44 - everything you learn will help you
46:46 - become a better programmer better data
46:48 - scientists better whatever game
46:50 - developer so yeah we don't have you
46:54 - don't have to commit and you can just
46:55 - try to career path for as long as you
46:57 - want and then if it's not for you you
46:59 - you know you turn over to a different of
47:02 - course her path actually that's a decent
47:07 - segue I heard the buzz word game
47:09 - development so from Victor though what
47:12 - languages are career paths would you
47:14 - recommend for gaming development to
47:16 - build skills and become a game
47:17 - programmer so we actually have a skill
47:22 - path on build web-based games using
47:26 - javascript and phaser library phaser Jas
47:29 - library so if you know HTML CSS in
47:32 - JavaScript you should definitely take
47:33 - that next but uh in game industry my
47:37 - cousin is a game developer he's told me
47:39 - that the two languages that people look
47:43 - for are C++ and C sharp so C++ work with
47:46 - the real engine super popular and
47:49 - c-sharp works with something called
47:52 - unity and those are so learn C sharp and
47:56 - learn C++ are two languages that you
47:58 - should also try to pick up on code can
48:01 - be neat I'm just gonna take yeah there
48:05 - are a lot of great they're a lot of what
48:07 - a lot of questions there are a lot of
48:11 - great what's that there's I think
48:17 - there's a delay with Alex so Alex okay
48:21 - yeah that probably is gonna help Alex
48:23 - did you want to add to that answer for
48:25 - game development yeah there are a lot of
48:27 - great intro tutorials to unity I know
48:31 - and so that's using using C sharp so if
48:35 - you do some of it some artwork on coke
48:39 - add immediate and then you can also
48:40 - follow along with some of those android
48:43 - tutorials on unity which is a really
48:45 - good place to start game dev stuff great
48:48 - thank you
48:49 - I want to share it
48:51 - somebody in the chat right now Susan
48:54 - Sebastiani she is they are sharing
48:58 - information in one in two points exactly
49:02 - how they're using code Academy in the
49:05 - classroom so Susan thank you and I am
49:11 - going to copy/paste some of this
49:12 - information here so that we can have it
49:15 - for later that's really cool of you
49:17 - thank you for doing that okay so still
49:22 - getting questions this is cool one from
49:26 - Freddy Cortazar no let's say that you're
49:28 - completely new to coding how would you
49:30 - choose a language out of all the
49:32 - general-purpose ones
49:33 - is there a resource that explains not
49:36 - the pros and cons but more like the
49:37 - differences so I think this like we
49:40 - already answered like how do you choose
49:41 - but are there any resources that you go
49:46 - to do to pick a language to like show
49:49 - the differences between the languages or
49:51 - just surely yeah I also YouTube and
49:53 - Google are great places to look for
49:56 - there's tons of videos that's called you
49:58 - know the top ten languages of 2020 I
50:00 - would say the top two right now and then
50:04 - distri is you know one number one number
50:06 - two is Python JavaScript
50:08 - I thought is super beginner friendly it
50:10 - the syntax like how the coat looks the
50:13 - grammar structure and the the spelling
50:18 - of the the code the surface of the code
50:19 - rather than the semantics which is the
50:21 - meaning behind the syntax of Python is
50:23 - very very simple
50:28 - does have too much clust clutter it's
50:32 - actually not a super new language it was
50:34 - developed like in late 80s 89 but it's
50:38 - super popular because he has you know
50:40 - like went out 120,000 libraries and like
50:45 - almost two hundred thousand packages and
50:48 - they use a you can use it in a variety
50:50 - of domains like you know it's popular
50:54 - for back-end it's popular for machine
50:56 - learning ai it's popular you can use it
50:59 - for hardware now and JavaScript it's you
51:02 - know it
51:03 - makes a you know the webpages move so
51:07 - that's also you know definitely in the
51:08 - top two
51:09 - but Python you can learn it from scratch
51:11 - javascript i highly recommend you learn
51:13 - you know HTML and CSS first before
51:15 - jumping to JavaScript and Java scripts
51:17 - great for a web development and mobile
51:18 - development but outside of the number
51:23 - one number two the top 5 and top 10
51:25 - that's very debatable we just see it you
51:27 - know a top two very strong and their
51:30 - lead but you know some people say Chavez
51:32 - you know third some people say you know
51:36 - C++ you know they're the list goes on
51:40 - III would suggest like looking at
51:42 - outcomes of like what products do you
51:46 - think are cool what what are you
51:48 - interested in and then try to figure out
51:50 - what languages are used to make that
51:53 - make those projects and so right if
51:57 - you're like super into design and um
51:59 - that sort of stuff then you might want
52:01 - to go down CSS HTML Javascript and make
52:05 - really awesome websites if you're more
52:07 - into data then that might be more Python
52:11 - that kind of stuff so I would say
52:14 - realistically if you've never coded
52:16 - before I always recommend doing Python
52:21 - because it's a really good beginner
52:23 - lesson or beginner language but if you
52:26 - if you have an idea of what you want to
52:29 - make I would look at those outcomes if
52:31 - you want to make iphone apps then
52:33 - there's no reason why you can't start
52:34 - learning Swift right yeah any language
52:38 - you can you can learn even with no
52:40 - experience and so if you don't care
52:43 - about what you want to do I would
52:43 - suggest Python but if you have an idea
52:45 - of what you want to do then
52:46 - look at me outcomes and trying to figure
52:48 - out what programming language is used to
52:50 - make that sort of stuff
52:51 - well what was your first language Alex I
52:55 - took I started coding in AP Computer
52:58 - Science in what 2008 and the AP tests
53:05 - hot Java and then when I went to college
53:08 - all like the intro courses were impacted
53:10 - on and so I did Java for a year and then
53:12 - quickly jumped over the Python and
53:14 - that's primarily what I coated in for
53:16 - for like
53:17 - how about you C C++ okay interesting
53:21 - yeah I've written like like ten lines of
53:23 - C code in my life next question yeah
53:29 - sure
53:30 - this one actually is coming from the
53:31 - chat this isn't coming from the question
53:33 - okay we might need Marielle another
53:36 - member of the c2c dev team for this but
53:39 - what applications would you need to
53:42 - learn natural language processing and
53:44 - why you learned why actually why I learn
53:47 - natural is processing what applications
53:51 - do you yeah what application to match
53:58 - language library and repositories of
54:09 - books and articles and all this sort of
54:11 - stuff that just like comes pre built
54:13 - into Python so it's a pretty easy
54:15 - language to get to get started so why
54:18 - why an ope I'm also fascinated by NLP
54:22 - because its language is absurdly
54:25 - difficult like it's amazing that you
54:27 - know we can talk to Siri and she has any
54:29 - idea what we're saying right it's I
54:32 - think it's cool because it's like kind
54:34 - of a field where it can always get
54:36 - better and it's like so difficult that
54:40 - there's like always innovations and it
54:42 - gets better and better which i think is
54:43 - kind of cool yeah it's it's it's it's
54:47 - interesting so Emma P is like
54:49 - intersection between linguistics
54:51 - computer science machine learning and
54:55 - not only we're talking about like audio
54:58 - right we're also talking about like word
54:59 - processing and like a Google search or
55:02 - so we we actually rely on and I'll pay
55:05 - more and more especially in like 2020
55:09 - yeah how do I use it I'll be in my life
55:12 - I mean Gmail just added the thing where
55:15 - it every sentence is like a predicted
55:17 - sentence right remember Li to write
55:19 - scene how to predict or sorry uh was it
55:24 - was that you know we're like Google Docs
55:26 - or something like it predicts the next
55:27 - yeah yeah right that's what I'm talking
55:29 - about yeah
55:31 - but yeah all the voice-activated
55:33 - technology all of that is relying on on
55:35 - NLP to understand what what you're
55:38 - talking about it's already filled though
55:41 - I think grad schools are offering and LP
55:44 - programs in the last like five years but
55:46 - it's still you know relatively new what
55:51 - framework would you sorry I didn't work
55:53 - more questions what framework would you
55:55 - advise to learn for web development in
55:57 - Python
55:58 - so there's flask and Django are the two
56:00 - big ones we have Flash content coming
56:03 - out within the next couple of months I
56:06 - don't know why we picked flask over
56:08 - Django but those are the two big ones
56:11 - and we're doing flasks there are two
56:16 - questions that came in that I think I
56:18 - can actually answer so one of them was
56:20 - from Emmanuel is when is the next
56:22 - Community Challenge so a plug for how
56:26 - the communities work it comes from
56:29 - community members so if that's something
56:33 - that you can visit discuss cook enemy
56:37 - comm find a moderator find a super user
56:40 - and propose lunch and also find me you
56:45 - can find me there and we can put one
56:47 - together that's a that's the thing that
56:49 - we just we just do one one another
56:52 - question that I think I can answer from
56:55 - Stephen Gardner's will there be a
56:56 - meet-up in person when this is all over
56:59 - gosh I hope so gosh I hope so I hope we
57:02 - have so many in New York City if you're
57:05 - local
57:06 - yeah absolutely as all things that come
57:11 - from that happen in the community they
57:13 - come from the community so Stephen not
57:16 - sure where you are but if you want to
57:18 - see a meet-up happen locally
57:21 - I'm find me I can find you in the forums
57:24 - and we can do that
57:26 - I'd love to support you with that so
57:29 - we're at 59 we're at the top of the hour
57:33 - any parting words from Alex and Sonny
57:38 - parting words Jesus I know sorry I
57:41 - didn't mean it like that
57:44 - today's call I think this is a great
57:47 - time to I mean it's an interesting time
57:52 - very weird time but I think it's a good
57:56 - time to buckle down and you know take
57:58 - advantage of this time if you've been
58:00 - working you know six seven days a week
58:01 - there's a great time to catch up on your
58:02 - shows if you you know don't feel like
58:06 - you know you've been doing much and you
58:07 - want to pick up you know want to get
58:10 - started this is like a great time to
58:11 - reset and you know learn the skills that
58:14 - you need you know build the little
58:16 - primal program that you always wanted to
58:18 - build I definitely have you know five
58:22 - books that haven't finished that I'm
58:23 - trying to reap doing this period I have
58:26 - like I started by having finished
58:27 - there's tons of little projects I
58:30 - projects I've been working on that I'm
58:32 - trying to knock out who knows when it's
58:36 - all over but yeah I think this is a
58:39 - great time to to work on things that you
58:41 - always wanted to and I really hope yeah
58:50 - yeah yeah this was super cool it's nice
58:55 - to hear from all of you
58:57 - I think the echoing what Sonny is saying
59:00 - just like I think one of the
59:02 - difficulties of doing all this from home
59:04 - is that collaboration is a huge part of
59:06 - coding I saw one question here was like
59:09 - I was talking about what are the main
59:13 - challenges of letting students self
59:15 - learn on your platform as opposed to
59:16 - like being in school I think the biggest
59:18 - challenge with that is that when you're
59:20 - at school you can collaborate super
59:22 - easily with with other people so I would
59:25 - say that the biggest challenge is that
59:27 - your higher self and it's hard to talk
59:29 - to people it's hard set bounds ideas off
59:30 - of them and so I'd recommend doing
59:33 - whatever you can to collaborate with
59:36 - people whether that's you know getting
59:37 - on zoom' calls and sharing your screen
59:39 - and working through code together yeah
59:41 - doing whatever you can to not feel as
59:44 - completely isolated as you could be if
59:46 - you're just coding alone yeah that's - -
59:52 - onwards what's up I said I guess I I
59:56 - guess I answered a question
59:57 - my final word because I did okay oh yeah
60:03 - what are your Twitter handles yeah we
60:05 - can we can share those these but yeah
60:06 - happy to chat after this through
60:10 - messages and whatnot if you have
60:11 - questions more questions you know we're
60:14 - in the same situations as everybody
60:16 - right the whole world is kind of on
60:17 - pause right now so it's kind of great to
60:19 - to also you know give me some time to
60:22 - work with everybody here I think we
60:25 - talked with Michael Cruz I don't know if
60:28 - he's still in the chat but for like two
60:30 - three hours last Friday about things
60:31 - that you know the kirkin team at code
60:34 - can we can improve because we're
60:35 - definitely trying to build something and
60:37 - there's so many tons of areas where we
60:39 - can still make a lot of stride and you
60:43 - know making our content better is you
60:44 - know even our highest traffic courses
60:47 - like WebEx courses like learnings to
60:48 - know and things like that so yeah the
60:54 - main point is that we like hearing from
60:56 - you and that's all I would kind of say I
61:00 - want to hear from you so much more this
61:04 - was cool I don't want to volunteer sunny
61:09 - and Alex but I'll say it for myself
61:10 - we're gonna do this more like like this
61:14 - is fun this is easy you know we're just
61:17 - getting on and chatting with all you
61:18 - it's it's fun it's yeah it's fun because
61:22 - you showed up so thanks for doing that
61:25 - and hope to see you next time
61:28 - thank you everyone everybody Oh Alex you
61:34 - gonna end it thanks Larry yeah let me
61:37 - figure out how to turn this off by Alton

Cleaned transcript:

all right here we are well hi everybody yes thank you for joining us today we're gonna get started with a recorded version of this webinar the background on that is that we wanted to make sure that we had all the relevant information for everybody without technical difficulties we're all at home my name is ELISA we're on the phone with Alex and sunny today Alex yeah hi I'm Alex curriculum developer at code Academy sunny and I have worked on putting together that blog post if you've seen that blog post about resources on how to work with coke atom e from home so that's a that's what we'll be talking about today a little bit yeah hello everybody I'm sunny I am currently wrapping up our learn Swift course with the learn Swift team and helping this gonna be a fun day yeah that blog post can be found at news dot code Kadim e.com that's gonna read as like a background I guess script go into some highlevel information we're gonna go deeper in today so in just a moment we're gonna press play on the recording if you're watching this you'll see sunny Alex in my camera go away so we can all focus on the broadcast that we have for you and then as soon as that's over we're gonna pop back in and we'll do Q&A I am super excited about this I'm super ready for this thank you so much for already engaging with the poll that we just sent out yeah just some questions so we can know who we're chatting with today cool Wow Wow it looks like we've got some people who just signed up one thing I want to test before we dive in for real is are we able to send Q&A can somebody just tell us where you're calling in from so like let's test out this this question and answer let's see what we get I'm from Colorado Susan I'm from Colorado it works and work we also have chat oh yeah cool and then Michael the poems or I might may have to launch the poll uh yeah I think I think it's gonna be greedy I'm gonna be greedy and be the only one who can see though the Preferences so so far it looks like 71% of you just signed up but 29 have you been coding for a while Pat yourselves on the back that's really great everybody we have 86% students on the line with us today 29% teachers 29% parents those don't add up to hundred that's because you could choose multiple and holy smokes a hundred percent of respondents that are learning Python Wow okay that's also a multiple choice so we've got fifty percent of people in system only but thirty three percent into C++ thank you for filling out the poll it's super exciting to see this happen time okay so this is who we've got with us we've got people from Pakistan Germany Greece south central Idaho and people learning all kinds of stuff so this is gonna be good this is gonna be great I think that we are ready we're five minutes in let's yeah so as this video is playing we'll be we'll just turn it off our camera but we'll still be here so if you want to ask questions in the question panel as the video is going feel free to do that and answer them as the video is going or kind of back lock them for after the video and we can answer them on air let's cool let's keep the lines of communication open and we are about to get started three two one everyone thank you for joining us today my name is Alisa I'm calling today but codecademy we've got two of our curriculum developers online can't wait to introduce you to them we have sunny leave hello everybody sunny I'm on that curricula team and Alex Koontz and today's webinar is to help everyone who has recently signed up for a scholarship or recently signed up or Codecademy to be super successful and use this time to learn to code so this is an opportunity I think for someone on our team sunny has so much passion for what he does so I think I think sunny why don't why don't you tell us about like how this scholarship program and and what you're doing at Koch added me all just fit together with our mission oh sure so Co cami is essentially a leading online learning platform that teaches Peabody code in a very easy and fun way and we have courses on computer science web development mobile development game development and data science we have courses on 14 different languages that each include lessons quizzes projects articles videos and Co challenges and our mission behind all of this is that we are trying to empower people around the world to transform everyone's personal and professional lives by helping them learn skills like coding and this is a very tough time as a former teacher I can't imagine what teachers and students are going through right now and we're trying us to to do everything that we can to support our student learners we believe that even though school may have been cancelled we hope that learning does not stop and on the term Alex right now to go over we're going to cover today in this webinar yeah so along those lines we think that coke Adam II is a platform that people can really use to continue learning while they may be stuck at home and not going to school and so today we're kind of gonna go through how you might do that whether you're a teacher and you're looking to develop some curriculum for your students that are stuck at home or you're a student that is at home and might not know what to do or what resources to turn to the purpose of this webinar is to really kind of guide you to use Khan Academy to help you work so we're gonna go through what code Academy is so if you've never used code Academy before and you don't know what it is or how to use it we're gonna give you a little bit of a demo of one of our lessons we'll talk about the scholarship program that we just started and how you can use your dot edu or dot k12 email address to sign up for a free promo code and then after that we all specifically discuss for teachers and for students like what strategies might want to use to use our curriculum and help you out in your classroom so we can walk through maybe different lesson plans that you might be able to make so let's go and get started with that I guess we'll start and something you can somebody was the once actually write this course but this is kind of our bread and butter on coke Adam II this is a code Academy course this one happens to be learn Swift so a typical course will be between 30 30 and 45 minutes we say so me like I met around that size for a course and so you know a fairly good block if you want to assign an assignment of course might be a good a good unit to be able to assign for a day or for a couple of days and kind of the benefit of coke Adam II is like we have this interactive coding environment so this is a course that's teaching Swift which is a programming language and you can see that there's instruction here and there are some instructions or goals that the the student is trying to accomplish we have some hints I can show how they how they accomplish those and then over here we have our interactive coding section of the website so you can write code here you can run the code and see the results and so really the benefit of code Academy is that it's all right there for you on the website you don't have to do any work to set things up outside of a website you literally just go to one of these courses and we've got you know this text editor where you can start writing code and some of the cool things about our learning environment is that we have a cloud navigation system so right on top of the coeditor you can actually manipulate different files the file names is also at the top and on the right hand side that's what's called a terminal this is where your when you type code and the coeditor the output will be displayed in the black box so you can see you know we're doing some simple coding here or we're adding one plus one but as you walk through these lessons things will get more complicated and in this case you would learn all about the programming language Swift so that's kind of the basic basic stuff like what code catta me is essentially it is curriculum about coding where you get to code along as you're learning next we wanted to talk a little bit about the scholarship itself so we're offering the scholarships to students and teachers that have education email addresses so you know that end in dot edu or dot k12 you'll see down here in the frequently asked questions if you are a student or our teacher and don't have one of those email addresses you can fill out this form and we'll try to get you one of these scholarships anyways so essentially what this scholarship is is access to more every bit of curriculum on our site so if you click here to join pro on this page is where you would sign up with that dot edu or dot k12 email account and so I'll do I'll sign up with my own University email account hello Carleton people and if we go and say start coming out we also gotta do a CAPTCHA identify some motorcycles hmm fun cool so we you just signed up for or we just signed up for an account there's a little bit of onboarding if you want some course recommendations things like that but instead of doing that we can just jump to the catalog and Sonny do you want to talk a little bit about what people can do now that they have one of these scholarships and one of these pro accounts what maybe I'm doing the catalog kami has 14 different programming languages if you count some of the market languages like HTML CSS and SAS with the scholarship and lots pretty much all the content and courses in our catalog so with the pro search screen you have pro courses you have something called skill path which essentially teaches a skill using a basic language and you also have career paths such as web dental and path in computer science path data science path almost once long of curriculum yeah these these paths are cute which I would say you know three four months minimum we would take to get through some of these fads yeah about past that you can actually start from not knowing any code not having write in any code and we just kind of built you up from there yeah yeah but so to be clear when you sign up using these scholarships you'll see that this is the account that I just I just created using one of those edu accounts and you'll see that it is a coke at me Pro account so when you sign up using these scholarships you have access to literally every single piece of content that we have on the site so any of these chrome courses that you might be interested in taking skill pouts you'll have access to to any of those these scholarships are for 90 days we as of now we're having these runs through the what the traditional school year would be so at the end of those 90 days your account won't be the activator in it or anything you won't just no longer have access to these core courses a question if I were a teacher how would I go about sharing with my class what they can do or should do yes so Sonny and I were both teachers somebody if you were a teacher and you had to figure out curriculum how would you use Khan Academy to to do that yeah so the first thing I try to pinpoint is what the class like to do in this downtown some of the students and I want to build a web app they might want to build a mobile absolutely I want to build a create like a data visualization a chatbot so basically first I'll pinpoint their experience level their interests their grade level and create a lesson plan based on that by picking a course or skill path or a clear path and create a weekly calendar with our monthly calendar for the class to follow trying to you know make the students stay engaged in this time I'll probably post weekly discussions weekly checkins with the students another thing that I love to do is building team projects so after every you know a couple of modules it's on code Academy have students split up into different groups that have you know design something that wanted note and kind of just let them go for it yeah I think if we so I just clicked into the Java course Java's the language that AP Computer Science and sought in so this might be relevant to some teachers out there if we go into the learn Java course and take a look at the syllabus you can see the way that we've broken down the content is into fairly manageable chunks where again anything marked as a lesson is probably 30 to 45 minutes of content introduction so let's see if we go down the loops chapter this this lesson on loops will be introducing the concept of what is a loop you don't have you know that guided practice again working in the interactive coding terminal you can jump in here and look at that it's a links but again so we teach what the concept of loop is students are going to be able to practice it and you know pass these means challenges or checkpoints so in general I would say a lesson is kind of equivalent to a 45minute class that you might have you know during a normal school day we also have these quizzes which are a little bit shorter those only usually be 10 to 15 multiplechoice questions about that topic that they just learned so that's a good check for understanding at the after students have completed the lesson and then projects which is a content type that we haven't really talked about yet again that is similar to a lesson in that they're gonna be coding right on the code Academy platform what is this this is fizzbuzz right there are a number of tasks that students will be asked to do and again they'll be coding right in the text editor right here but the idea behind projects is that they're a little bit more selfguided and independent and students are asked to apply the skills that they just learned rather than learning the skills for the first time so if I were a teacher I would really I would probably organize my curriculum around okay we're gonna do an interactive lesson we learn new material we're gonna do a project that code Academy gave us where you're building something from scratch and then I would probably also challenge them my students to expand upon those projects and so that's probably what I would do if I were a teacher where I would go through the go through the lessons try the projects and then ask my students to expand on on the project's themselves which is maybe a good place for collaboration or like pair programming yeah and that's another way you can also divide up the curriculum is just maybe one module a day it might be a lot for beginners but I think it's easily doable within an hour yeah the module is one of these kind of collapsible sections so this is the module an array an ArrayList yeah I would say I would say maybe an hour and a half two hours for a module depends on how he can really want to dive into it yeah but I could definitely see that the probe is that you have every student share the same progress right so you can have nice end of the week discussions or you know have a point where you can all build a project together yeah for it for student for students if you don't have a teacher that's supplying you curriculum right if you're just a student that signed up for wannabe scholarships and you just got here and you're wondering what to do I probably get going to the catalog I probably would look at these career paths these are really long sections of content where Sonny and I were talking about this earlier where it might take three or four months to complete this but take a look at these see what you might be interested in whether it's building websites whether it's doing more kind of computer science theory the computer science tool path is pretty similar to what you might see in intro collegelevel courses or the first collegelevel courses or the data science don't path also if you're interested in analyzing data visualizing data all that all that kind of stuff you scopa sorry yeah no I just took a question if if I am a student how much experience do I need to have yeah so for these skill paths you can start completely from scratch you definitely don't need any experience we build them in such a way that we start you from the very beginning and we get you to a point where you're building something pretty cool so that that's a that's a really good place to start the the courses in the catalog vary there are some you know recommended that skills that you should already have like the machine learning course for example is fairly complex so you should be familiar with with a handful and things people are going into there but in general these skill paths you can start from absolutely no programming experience we will build it completely from the ground up and and there's so much content in there that by the end of it you're building some pretty cool stuff you know but remember one thing that if you're a student that you should do is try to pinpoint what you want to build now help you pick the right course we also kind of develop this course recommendation that we broke down as a freaking team that kind of divides up our catalog by education level so you should definitely check that out yeah yeah it's a great idea to take notes while you're taking a course so you can you know look back while you're doing the the project we also offered two sheets now to help you retain the knowledge that you're learning especially the syntax and we'll love for you to think about things they can build doing this specific time we already seen a couple really cool projects I think 100 workers Zoey's strike this out she sent this really cool little web app it's called do not touch it face essentially uses a webcam and a machine learning algorithm to to remind people alert people do not touch their faces buddies find your friends your classmates and try to you know appear fresh and get started with you and you know something cool together that's like one of the beauty of you know tech right now yeah so I think that's about it Lisa do you have anything else that you want to talk about no I think that this was fantastic I think that we covered the basics of how to get started with a scholarship or without one really I feel like this answers questions for a lot of people I think one of the first questions that I know in the community we see people ask is like where do I get help how it's gonna help me get unstuck I think we put together or you all put together a good list actually if that's something that we could show thank you yeah the piece or section me yes the yeah sure sure sure yes yes yes right we talked about teachers the students yeah so here are additional resources the coke atom II community so discuss that code Kathleen dotcom we say you do a ton of work over here if you want to talk a little bit about what's going on here sure yeah this is the space to come when you get stuck not if because that's part of it that's what that's what the learning is this space is actually completely monitored and moderated by a group of volunteers you'll most likely interact with them and our awesome teammate will is in here too answering questions all the time so this is a good place to go I am particularly fond of the rest of the work that you all put together too because there's an entire world adjacent to coke atom II and ways to learn too yeah so there's there's a bunch of really great YouTube channels that teach me how to code my personal favorite is the coding training which is NYU professor he does kind of similar bitesized coding exercises where he'll go through he teaches you how to build the snake game in around a half hour so even if you're not super experienced from a river yet I find that just watching people code and hearing them talk and seeing their thought process can be really helpful and as as he's going through these projects you might have ideas on how to change it a little bit or things that you might want to add that he didn't add so I really love specifically the coding train but they're a ton of really good YouTube resources out there as well we also added in oh yeah this is a great blog post how to start a group project collaboration is super important in coding and then this little piece just helps you get started yeah we'll try to get these links out to you but you can always look through our blog or Google how mister project wink at me and you should be able to find this finance blog post and then hacker ranking leak these two are really great platforms that can help keep your coding skills sharp by you know having these little code challenges that are great for the data structure and algorithm problems for technical interviews I think it's super nice to have something like this to do you know ten minutes a day 20 minutes day 30 minutes a day yeah I think these two don't don't focus a ton on introducing new concepts but if you already have a little bit of programming experience and you want some basically you want a 15 minute problem to wrap your mind around and test out your coding skills both of these are really great resources for that oh yeah another one is the COO Cammy app the code can we go yeah yeah I forgot to put that one on that one's just our mobile app that has also bitesized flashcards and while you're you know on Instagram while Jason or he could just you know that dude's coding for 10 minutes there's there's less you know typing code on that app just because that's a that's a pretty lousy experience fee writing out a bunch of a bunch of code on the app but a lot of really great review cards and like multiplechoice questions kind of quiz questions type things so yeah yeah is a good resource as well that's good I think what what all of these resources here have in common with code Academy Pro is that they're an opportunity to practice I think something that's really important to call some attention to is that code Academy is open to everybody and so much there's so much you can learn for free with code Academy Pro and this scholarship you get the opportunity to practice and I'll leave it to Alex and Sonny the actual educators here of the power of practice but when we want to actually make sure that we are cementing something we want to dive in and that's what we're we're really excited to be able to offer right now yeah I think you said it well yeah we know there are little features we have streets so uh with everyone everyone you know not necessarily going to school every day we could see some high streets up on our platform people logging in every day and we do a lesson or two now we were talking about potentially putting together a leader board yeah that'd be great I don't I don't know what the what the biggest streak we've ever had is but be fun to fun to find out uh yeah that's something that we can we can learn I don't know if that's I don't over promise there's an exciting time to see how many consecutive days I do think we will get a you know increased street numbers on each other all right this was super and super informative and I am really looking forward to sharing this with educators and students who are looking for something like this there should be an opportunity either on the Facebook post where this resource is shared or if you can't find an opportunity to write a comment on this webcast join us in the forums and definitely find the space that we've created just for students and teachers here ask questions Alex and Sonny don't want to speak for you but this is great I think that let's in fact just one last time and land on that Thank You page because that's what we really mean here a giant thank you for sticking with us today and for learning with us all right good luck out there you alright alright there we go we're here looking to share video okay cool we've got some questions there are some questions that came through for you Sonny and Alex it's just super exciting let's start with do you provide the full courses of all the languages are just the basics this is multiple answers here yeah so I would say that some languages are just the basics and some languages have a lot of content kind of our newer material is covering the basics although you know we go fairly far into into the details I think you can speak more to that like Swift is one of our newer languages how would you say how far into like basic Swift do you guys good yeah I'll say we teach probably all the fundamentals of Swift before so the large sort of course basically teaches the language rather than to just like how to build an iOS app but we are thinking about building a skill path or career path on iOS curriculum very soon so that will take you there and and we're trying to do that we try to like model that around how our Python content works right now so in the learn Python 3 course you're learning the basics of the language but you know you able to take that and learn different skills and skill paths like you know you'd learn about all the different Python packages and libraries such as matplotlib for 2dimensional data visualizations you learn about psyche learn package in the machine learning skill path and that will teaches you how to do some basic supervisor and supervised learning using the package we teach another really fun one is the beautiful library that helps you web scrape pulling data from different websites what else do we got for Python yeah basically I would say take a look at the career paths which here maybe I can share my screen just so I can show this once we talk about it cool by the way this is the perfect time to ask any questions we're here to answer okay we have we have ten in the queue right now okay I'm excited to see what Alex has this year I'm just gonna pull up the show the career paths which are kind of our longest who actually want me give me a second to screen share I need to log into my cup cami account let's answer another question yeah so we got a question from Faruk Mohammed can enunciate enjoin these courses absolutely most of our courses a lot of our courses actually help you get started from scratch so you don't need a CS degree or you don't need to take have taken is yes programming course to start on cocaptains yeah I'm also and actually I think this can be a twofer once Alex hits his screen setup there's one from Irene whoo if I were interested in following two career paths at the same time oh there we go what sort of daily schedule would you recommend to complete both in three to five months complete both yeah so that's which I don't know if Irene you're still in the in the stream but can you let us know which two career paths that you're taking right now because that might answer might be different web de and see us thanks Irene is super quick okay so web dev and CSR both are two of our probably longest paths career paths that we have it's it's definitely gonna be very tough to do both in let's say four or five months but if you do want to take that route which is which is possible I'll say you probably have to be coding learning every single day I'll say one module a day seems one module to two modules days seems about right yeah those paths are pretty big I would say one of the so I worked a lot on the data science career path and I think that one is equally as big as its computer science and web dev and I would say I would ask to meet like six to nine months to complete the data science path you know if you're coding you know if you're coding it for five or ten hours a week I would say it would take six to six to nine months yeah but it's doable it is doable but yeah and I also think is cool to be jumping between career paths where you're definitely learning different skills and you can start to see similarities between languages that pop up in those different paths okay I have another question yeah and you guys you can you can see past that would be okay I'm a first year computer science student I want to specialize in cybersecurity and AI what is the best programming language to master for these two subjects I already know Java and Python which one would be more helpful on my case yeah a Python is definitely my programming language of choice and I think that that's a great one to use for AI and cybersecurity stuff we have a little bit of AI content on coke Adam II and all of that is in Python there are a lot of really great Python libraries for doing machine learning and AI stuff um so that's a good place to start and as you get further further along into it you might do you might dive into some other languages but I would say Python is a good place to start you yeah just to name a few libraries for Python in terms of AI tensorflow is great for machine learning Carris is great if you're you know free opensource library well tensorflow is free open source but Chara's it's great if you're interested in learning deep learning I'm secular and we teach that and the gift started with machine learning and in the data science path course that also is a nice package to help with like the basics of machine learning yeah try to I don't know if I've ever talked to a learner who took the AI course that we have mmm that I wrote and I really love feedback on that so I so give that one a shot if you're an AI students I would love to hear what you think about it thank you I think that it's just I think we already answered this but I think it's also worth repeating oh we did with Farooq let's just put this in stone cannon on C a student join these courses yeah in terms of whether you can join the yeah so as long as you have a dot edu or dot k12 email account you can get one of these scholarships will post the we'll post the link to the scholarship page all over the place I'll post in the chat in a second but as long as you have one of those email accounts you can sign up for a scholarship it doesn't matter if you're a student or a humanities student or whatever it you can get it no matter what if you don't have a dot edu or k12 email account we have a form that you can fill out and we'll hopefully be able to get you set up with that as well it might take a day or two to get that set up but I'm trying to get you an account yeah there's there's another question I think it's been here awhile from Deepika will you introduce more languages like C sharp or etc yeah so we actually already have a csharp course that we recently released I'll say few months ago and we are currently working on ASP skill path that our coworker Nick is working on so it will be out in the upcoming months very soon and then we have another question from Troy thanks so each student needs to fill out a form question mark can you tell me how to assign things through Google classroom and check student's progress I have used Google classroom before the UX is for dental volunteer work at a co nation on that you school classroom and the UX is kind of complicated I don't know if you used it before else but it will be very difficult to teach that in this webinar so so unfortunately on code Academy we don't have something that like lets a teacher you know say that these 13 accounts or my students accounts and like let me look at all their progress we don't have anything right now that lets us do that I've seen that we request a couple of times just in this in this webinar so that's a good thing to note that that's something that you all are asking for when I was the classroom teacher I use code Academy and it's not super graceful but you can definitely basically I had I have my students like screenshot their their progress really yeah right because especially because our UI shows like you know that they're what what quizzes they've taken what modules they've taken okay so it's not super graceful but that's like something that you can do to check that project and have that be submissions I suppose you can also have them I don't know something you have any other advice on how you can track it check in on students and see how they're doing I mean one way that you know we we talked about this in video but it would be nice to have students work on team projects together like prayer Broga prayer program together so after you know every one module two modules you have students work on you know basically submit the code or like the folder zip file or the output like if you actually post it somewhere on github or somewhere of the code itself so that's like another way to check proper to see that they actually understood the material applied it to their own personal projects yes some of these some of these skill pounds have I know exist have off platform projects which basically means their products that instruct students or whoever is taking the course to download code themselves working on it on their own machine rather than on the code cottony website and so something like that would be fairly easy to first for a teacher to be able to check in on because the students are downloading the code themselves and working at on working on the code on their own machine they can just send you those files so maybe an op off platform project like this one where you actually go and download the code instead of working on it on Co Academy that might be a little bit easier for teachers that are looking to like checking on students okay I hope there's some like really good questions coming through now I'm not so sure that we got to this one but this is probably the most popular question I see asked in the community forums is if I want to be job ready with Jessica ketamine will that be enough the question goes on to say that I know I want your view and your advice and by the way I'm already focusing on a web development path okay we could yeah we get that question a lot so I mean you want to take that I think you might know the end of web development path better than I do yeah so I think I mean the goal of code Cammy at least on the curriculum team is try to build something that's a almost like a onestop shop where you can come to cook at me you know finish a career path and be job ready but I do think that it's important to go off platform a lot of times to seek out resources wherever you can so as you're taking a course on code Academy I highly suggest to take know even though you don't you know sometimes you don't look back on your notes it's good to it's a way to retain information I'll also try to build a lot of portfolio projects right like use the Codecademy projects the prompt to build something euro and I will try to join different communities like the code Academy community on Facebook and mobilize I'll try to join Twitter follow all my favorite RIT you know a lot of like wellknown developers I would try to join deaf too you know just just a talk code right and and you know once you're done with the one on path you should definitely take that data stretch and algorithms any of you prep on code kami for JavaScript and that should be able to and just network but there are a lot of things that you should do I think I'm gonna write a blog post on this later on to to to you know make the the programming journey and more a whole a whole London yeah echo what you said sunny I think like the number one thing is probably to build a portfolio or a personal website or github someplace where you can show the work that you have done and so the way that you can use CAD imme to do that is to like take the take the off platform project seriously right where if there's if there's an off platform project that asks you to download code and work on it on your own machine really make sure that you are like comfortable doing that and then once you are comfortable doing that I would even recommend like you know if you're working on a project that's on code Academy on the website you can do it on the website but then I would we can say grab that code throw it into your code editor on your own computer and um you know expands on that project do stretch goals new challenges things like that and kind of trying to turn it into your own thing and then that can be a part of your portfolio or website or or something like that but you basically just like have to be able to show your code somewhere show can also talk code that's a very underrated skill to write to chat like to talk about programming and I also think this is a great time to I mean it's a down time right it's good time to reset and work on things that we're just like tackle things that you've never tried before with coding there are a lot of virtual hackathons going on right now that you could take a look a lot of them are Cove in nineteen related but I highly suggest you to join one you know find a team and come out with the project next question yeah Alex you're still sharing screen sure I can stop wait so this event is like this is another one that I want to touch on because it's such a common one I'm having a hard time choosing the kind of path I need to take hmm when I start a path I can't focus on it because I'm not really sure if it's the right one for me how can I fix that yeah I mean this is a great question I feel like you're gonna give this question it doesn't matter which career path career industry that you're in is this thing for me I've definitely run into that problem a lot because I'm somebody who's interested Oh a lot of things that means we are I'm interested mobile I'm interested in creative coding I'm interested in hardware but I suggest that you just try a bunch of things right before committing to a career path definitely learn some of the fundamentals right like a1 learn X course so you understand the fundamentals of programming and you can use that take that with you whenever you decide whichever career path that you want to take and also I like to pinpoint I think that you should pinpoint which what kind of things that you want to work on right I think that's a very important thing do you want to build a bit of a position do you want to build a Twitter bod you want to build this Square bot do you want to build a heart where projects do you want to work on well the lab web app desktop apps frontend backend do want to work with data like sequel our Python so you got a pin point you know the things they text you like that makes you that you enjoy before you know and you don't have to commit on anything right you can just everything you learn will help you become a better programmer better data scientists better whatever game developer so yeah we don't have you don't have to commit and you can just try to career path for as long as you want and then if it's not for you you you know you turn over to a different of course her path actually that's a decent segue I heard the buzz word game development so from Victor though what languages are career paths would you recommend for gaming development to build skills and become a game programmer so we actually have a skill path on build webbased games using javascript and phaser library phaser Jas library so if you know HTML CSS in JavaScript you should definitely take that next but uh in game industry my cousin is a game developer he's told me that the two languages that people look for are C++ and C sharp so C++ work with the real engine super popular and csharp works with something called unity and those are so learn C sharp and learn C++ are two languages that you should also try to pick up on code can be neat I'm just gonna take yeah there are a lot of great they're a lot of what a lot of questions there are a lot of great what's that there's I think there's a delay with Alex so Alex okay yeah that probably is gonna help Alex did you want to add to that answer for game development yeah there are a lot of great intro tutorials to unity I know and so that's using using C sharp so if you do some of it some artwork on coke add immediate and then you can also follow along with some of those android tutorials on unity which is a really good place to start game dev stuff great thank you I want to share it somebody in the chat right now Susan Sebastiani she is they are sharing information in one in two points exactly how they're using code Academy in the classroom so Susan thank you and I am going to copy/paste some of this information here so that we can have it for later that's really cool of you thank you for doing that okay so still getting questions this is cool one from Freddy Cortazar no let's say that you're completely new to coding how would you choose a language out of all the generalpurpose ones is there a resource that explains not the pros and cons but more like the differences so I think this like we already answered like how do you choose but are there any resources that you go to do to pick a language to like show the differences between the languages or just surely yeah I also YouTube and Google are great places to look for there's tons of videos that's called you know the top ten languages of 2020 I would say the top two right now and then distri is you know one number one number two is Python JavaScript I thought is super beginner friendly it the syntax like how the coat looks the grammar structure and the the spelling of the the code the surface of the code rather than the semantics which is the meaning behind the syntax of Python is very very simple does have too much clust clutter it's actually not a super new language it was developed like in late 80s 89 but it's super popular because he has you know like went out 120,000 libraries and like almost two hundred thousand packages and they use a you can use it in a variety of domains like you know it's popular for backend it's popular for machine learning ai it's popular you can use it for hardware now and JavaScript it's you know it makes a you know the webpages move so that's also you know definitely in the top two but Python you can learn it from scratch javascript i highly recommend you learn you know HTML and CSS first before jumping to JavaScript and Java scripts great for a web development and mobile development but outside of the number one number two the top 5 and top 10 that's very debatable we just see it you know a top two very strong and their lead but you know some people say Chavez you know third some people say you know C++ you know they're the list goes on III would suggest like looking at outcomes of like what products do you think are cool what what are you interested in and then try to figure out what languages are used to make that make those projects and so right if you're like super into design and um that sort of stuff then you might want to go down CSS HTML Javascript and make really awesome websites if you're more into data then that might be more Python that kind of stuff so I would say realistically if you've never coded before I always recommend doing Python because it's a really good beginner lesson or beginner language but if you if you have an idea of what you want to make I would look at those outcomes if you want to make iphone apps then there's no reason why you can't start learning Swift right yeah any language you can you can learn even with no experience and so if you don't care about what you want to do I would suggest Python but if you have an idea of what you want to do then look at me outcomes and trying to figure out what programming language is used to make that sort of stuff well what was your first language Alex I took I started coding in AP Computer Science in what 2008 and the AP tests hot Java and then when I went to college all like the intro courses were impacted on and so I did Java for a year and then quickly jumped over the Python and that's primarily what I coated in for for like how about you C C++ okay interesting yeah I've written like like ten lines of C code in my life next question yeah sure this one actually is coming from the chat this isn't coming from the question okay we might need Marielle another member of the c2c dev team for this but what applications would you need to learn natural language processing and why you learned why actually why I learn natural is processing what applications do you yeah what application to match language library and repositories of books and articles and all this sort of stuff that just like comes pre built into Python so it's a pretty easy language to get to get started so why why an ope I'm also fascinated by NLP because its language is absurdly difficult like it's amazing that you know we can talk to Siri and she has any idea what we're saying right it's I think it's cool because it's like kind of a field where it can always get better and it's like so difficult that there's like always innovations and it gets better and better which i think is kind of cool yeah it's it's it's it's interesting so Emma P is like intersection between linguistics computer science machine learning and not only we're talking about like audio right we're also talking about like word processing and like a Google search or so we we actually rely on and I'll pay more and more especially in like 2020 yeah how do I use it I'll be in my life I mean Gmail just added the thing where it every sentence is like a predicted sentence right remember Li to write scene how to predict or sorry uh was it was that you know we're like Google Docs or something like it predicts the next yeah yeah right that's what I'm talking about yeah but yeah all the voiceactivated technology all of that is relying on on NLP to understand what what you're talking about it's already filled though I think grad schools are offering and LP programs in the last like five years but it's still you know relatively new what framework would you sorry I didn't work more questions what framework would you advise to learn for web development in Python so there's flask and Django are the two big ones we have Flash content coming out within the next couple of months I don't know why we picked flask over Django but those are the two big ones and we're doing flasks there are two questions that came in that I think I can actually answer so one of them was from Emmanuel is when is the next Community Challenge so a plug for how the communities work it comes from community members so if that's something that you can visit discuss cook enemy comm find a moderator find a super user and propose lunch and also find me you can find me there and we can put one together that's a that's the thing that we just we just do one one another question that I think I can answer from Stephen Gardner's will there be a meetup in person when this is all over gosh I hope so gosh I hope so I hope we have so many in New York City if you're local yeah absolutely as all things that come from that happen in the community they come from the community so Stephen not sure where you are but if you want to see a meetup happen locally I'm find me I can find you in the forums and we can do that I'd love to support you with that so we're at 59 we're at the top of the hour any parting words from Alex and Sonny parting words Jesus I know sorry I didn't mean it like that today's call I think this is a great time to I mean it's an interesting time very weird time but I think it's a good time to buckle down and you know take advantage of this time if you've been working you know six seven days a week there's a great time to catch up on your shows if you you know don't feel like you know you've been doing much and you want to pick up you know want to get started this is like a great time to reset and you know learn the skills that you need you know build the little primal program that you always wanted to build I definitely have you know five books that haven't finished that I'm trying to reap doing this period I have like I started by having finished there's tons of little projects I projects I've been working on that I'm trying to knock out who knows when it's all over but yeah I think this is a great time to to work on things that you always wanted to and I really hope yeah yeah yeah this was super cool it's nice to hear from all of you I think the echoing what Sonny is saying just like I think one of the difficulties of doing all this from home is that collaboration is a huge part of coding I saw one question here was like I was talking about what are the main challenges of letting students self learn on your platform as opposed to like being in school I think the biggest challenge with that is that when you're at school you can collaborate super easily with with other people so I would say that the biggest challenge is that your higher self and it's hard to talk to people it's hard set bounds ideas off of them and so I'd recommend doing whatever you can to collaborate with people whether that's you know getting on zoom' calls and sharing your screen and working through code together yeah doing whatever you can to not feel as completely isolated as you could be if you're just coding alone yeah that's onwards what's up I said I guess I I guess I answered a question my final word because I did okay oh yeah what are your Twitter handles yeah we can we can share those these but yeah happy to chat after this through messages and whatnot if you have questions more questions you know we're in the same situations as everybody right the whole world is kind of on pause right now so it's kind of great to to also you know give me some time to work with everybody here I think we talked with Michael Cruz I don't know if he's still in the chat but for like two three hours last Friday about things that you know the kirkin team at code can we can improve because we're definitely trying to build something and there's so many tons of areas where we can still make a lot of stride and you know making our content better is you know even our highest traffic courses like WebEx courses like learnings to know and things like that so yeah the main point is that we like hearing from you and that's all I would kind of say I want to hear from you so much more this was cool I don't want to volunteer sunny and Alex but I'll say it for myself we're gonna do this more like like this is fun this is easy you know we're just getting on and chatting with all you it's it's fun it's yeah it's fun because you showed up so thanks for doing that and hope to see you next time thank you everyone everybody Oh Alex you gonna end it thanks Larry yeah let me figure out how to turn this off by Alton
