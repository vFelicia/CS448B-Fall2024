00:00 - hello my name is Maggie I am a web and
00:03 - graphic designer from the Philadelphia
00:05 - area in this video we are going to learn
00:08 - how to push code to github in this video
00:12 - we are going to cover github as a tool
00:15 - to manage our web design projects we are
00:18 - also going to take a look at how we go
00:20 - about pushing our code to github before
00:26 - we go further let's talk about github
00:28 - what is github github is a version
00:33 - control system we can work on projects
00:37 - and github will keep track of all of the
00:40 - different versions of this project we've
00:43 - all experienced working on projects
00:45 - where we have folder after folder after
00:48 - folder of different versions github will
00:52 - do this for us
00:53 - github is a publishing tool and a great
00:57 - way to collaborate with others on a
01:00 - project what are the benefits of working
01:05 - with github github is a great way to
01:08 - track our codebase to share and
01:11 - collaborate as well as to save our
01:14 - process and go back to earlier points in
01:17 - our projects we all have experienced or
01:20 - will experience when we get our project
01:23 - to a point where it's working really
01:24 - well and then we go three more steps and
01:27 - it no longer works with github we have
01:31 - the ability to go back to that earlier
01:33 - version and work from there one of the
01:39 - major benefits is github makes it
01:42 - difficult to mess up our projects let's
01:48 - try it out your door is an interactive
01:53 - web project on code cad amis platform
01:55 - now that i have worked through this
01:57 - project I have taken the files the HTML
02:01 - CSS and the JavaScript file I have
02:04 - created a local folder on my computer
02:06 - with the code I can see the path to this
02:09 - project on my computer
02:11 - let's take a quick look at the project
02:12 - the goal of this game is to not choose
02:16 - the door with the chore bot now I'm
02:19 - going to take this project the HTML the
02:22 - CSS and the JavaScript and push this
02:24 - code to a repository on github
02:28 - I open github I make sure that I am all
02:31 - logged in and I begin by creating a new
02:35 - repository I hit the plus sign and
02:38 - select new repository I give my
02:42 - repository a name I will name my
02:45 - repository chore door I come to my
02:48 - description which is optional and I am
02:50 - going to add a description code Kadim e
02:53 - chor door project my folder is sets of
02:58 - public and I'm going to skip adding a
03:00 - readme file I create my repository my
03:05 - next page has a lot of really good
03:07 - information on how I will push my code
03:09 - my project to my github repository
03:11 - working with the terminal step 2 we open
03:15 - the terminal we come to step 3 here we
03:20 - are going to set our local project as
03:22 - the current directory we type PWD this
03:26 - will find and locate the present working
03:28 - directory
03:29 - I need to change my directory I type CD
03:32 - and then I specify the folder where my
03:36 - project is located next I will type LS
03:41 - this will list the files that are inside
03:44 - of this folder step 4
03:47 - I initialize my local directory as it
03:50 - get repository I type get an it and hit
03:54 - return in step 5 I'm going to add the
03:58 - files in my local folder to like git
04:02 - repository I am staging my files for
04:05 - their first commit I type get add period
04:10 - this will add all of the files inside of
04:14 - that folder I'm going to type git status
04:17 - and hit return I will now see all of the
04:21 - files that I have staged for commit
04:24 - now let's commit the files from our
04:27 - local repository we type get commit - em
04:33 - and inside of quotation marks I type
04:37 - first commit now we need to specify the
04:44 - remote repository URL so we come back to
04:47 - our github repository quick setup page
04:50 - and we copy the URL in step 8 we'll add
04:56 - the URL for the remote repository we do
04:58 - this by typing the following get remote
05:02 - add origin and we paste the URL I now
05:07 - can push the code in my local repository
05:09 - to github I type the following get push
05:15 - - you origin master I hit return now I
05:21 - will be asked to enter my username and
05:25 - password once I've completed all of
05:27 - these steps I can come back to github
05:30 - and I can view my files inside of my
05:33 - repository we have successfully pushed
05:37 - our code to github over the course of
05:41 - this video we took a look at how github
05:43 - is a great way to track our code base we
05:46 - also follow the steps of pushing code
05:49 - pushing a project to github thanks for
05:54 - watching this was Maggie with code Kadim
05:56 - II join the conversation by subscribing
05:59 - to the channel or dropping a comment
06:00 - below if you want to take your skills to
06:02 - the next level start learning on code
06:05 - Academy today thanks so much
