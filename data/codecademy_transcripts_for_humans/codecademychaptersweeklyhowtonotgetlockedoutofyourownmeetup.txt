00:17 - it's happened twice and it was really
00:19 - awful and terrible
00:21 - for the poor chapter leader who got
00:24 - caught in the situation
00:26 - thankfully for the second one that
00:28 - happened we were able to get in there
00:30 - first but the the point is nobody should
00:33 - have to deal with this so today we're
00:34 - going to do a little
00:35 - demo on how to make sure that you
00:39 - can not get locked out of your own event
00:43 - on the day of so here i am i'm sharing
00:46 - my screen

00:48 - your chapter and then
00:50 - any live events will be under events tab
00:54 - hooray it's here three dots
00:58 - gets us to edit your event
01:02 - we are not interested with general info
01:04 - we are not interested with sponsors and
01:06 - partners

01:12 - looks totally normal we're gonna have
01:14 - you know 50 people oh wait
01:16 - what is this settings thing right here
01:20 - click on it it looks like it should be
01:21 - absolutely nothing but it actually is
01:23 - hiding some
01:24 - really incredibly important boxes over
01:27 - here
01:27 - so what i've done is i've set the
01:30 - availability to end
01:32 - in until 30 minutes into
01:36 - the start of my event and that is so
01:40 - anybody can still access including me
01:44 - up until 30 minutes into my event if we
01:46 - don't set this
01:48 - it's unclear right now if you're gonna
01:50 - get locked out of your
01:51 - own event so it's really important to
01:54 - when setting your
01:55 - event up on your rsvps tab that like
01:59 - third modal and event setup
02:02 - click on this b9 looking little
02:06 - settings button and set your
02:08 - availability end
02:09 - into 30 minutes into your actual event
02:12 - now just to make sure
02:13 - that we're actually all good here i'm
02:16 - going to close this
02:17 - and go to publish
02:22 - super important to make sure that we've
02:24 - saved all changes there

02:39 - which is
02:40 - the day that it's happening and we've
02:42 - set the time for 30 minutes into
02:44 - the start of the event again this video
02:48 - is on how to not get locked out of your
02:50 - own event in the moments before it's
02:52 - going to happen

02:56 - avoidable thank you for watching have a
