00:02 - cool all right and we are live
00:09 - hello everybody my name is sunny and I
00:13 - am a curriculum developer here at code
00:15 - Academy and before this I taught CS in
00:19 - the classroom and for the last year and
00:21 - a half I worked on ton of courses
00:23 - extremely proud of including sequel
00:26 - content using datasets from Warby Parker
00:28 - twitch the met hacker news some ml
00:32 - content such as the handwriting
00:35 - recognition and the street easy multiple
00:37 - linear regression lessons some C++
00:41 - content such as the Harry Potter sorting
00:43 - hat quiz that super psyched about but
00:47 - the course that is dropping today might
00:51 - be my new favorite thing on code Academy
00:55 - before we get it sorted though let's
00:57 - spam and chat where is everybody from
00:59 - where are you from
01:01 - and also if you're feeling it let's add
01:05 - a fun fact about yourself
01:09 - what's a fungi about me my favorite food
01:13 - is barbeque eel
01:21 - there's an error arlynn from India hello
01:25 - Jean from France New Zealand from the
01:32 - United Kingdom Pennsylvania Netherlands
01:35 - Blair's for you
01:37 - Georgia London hello Kelly hello Gregory
01:43 - hello David
01:44 - hello Mary Joe hello spots night from
01:47 - Chicago
01:55 - so how many people are we at right now
01:58 - 110 cool as we're waiting for people to
02:01 - jump in the stream let's go over some
02:02 - the cool stuff that were released over
02:04 - the last few weeks we released log code
02:08 - on April Fool's Day so my buddy Josh is
02:11 - a front-end engineer on the grill team
02:13 - and I co-wrote this chorus for April
02:19 - Fool's on Wako this esoteric programming
02:21 - language that's inspired by internet
02:25 - memes and cats so right now it is a
02:28 - easter egg course meaning it's not part
02:31 - of the catalogue you have to have the
02:32 - URL so go google you know code CAD me
02:36 - learn law code and you'll find it so
02:40 - please go take that our suite plus plus
02:42 - community challenge also wrapped up also
02:44 - concluded it lasted the whole month of
02:46 - March we Eric from Cali and snun from
02:52 - Turkey have teamed up and made a super
02:54 - beautiful recipe terminal app and they
03:01 - both got a cook yummy hoodie and I'll do
03:03 - we know who no deliver to their doors
03:05 - another course shops include learn R
03:08 - which is a programming language and
03:11 - software environment
03:14 - that is used for statistical computing
03:16 - and research and we also released learn
03:20 - C sharp this is super awesome a widely
03:22 - used language a general-purpose language
03:24 - also focus not o P released by Microsoft
03:28 - so go check that out
03:30 - cool hello you serve Anthony from San
03:34 - Francisco Jennifer
03:35 - Charleston South Carolina hello Toronto
03:37 - Toronto Sudan greetings from
03:40 - Pennsylvania
03:41 - fun fact my cats are featured in our
03:44 - vlog course yes and also my two my cat
03:48 - babies pypy alfafa
03:49 - are internet memes our memes are
03:53 - course like still can't believe it
03:56 - anyways you're not here for those
04:00 - courses so today I'm super super super
04:03 - stoked to announce that we're finally
04:05 - releasing our first ever hardware course
04:09 - so whether interested in electronics
04:11 - wearables robotics IOT whatever this is
04:18 - the course for you this is something I
04:20 - really wanted when I was a student in
04:23 - college and I'm super happy that we
04:27 - actually got this out and for this
04:29 - course we actually teamed up with
04:31 - Adafruit
04:35 - we're not even start with Adafruit so
04:37 - when I was in undergrad I well wrapped
04:40 - around underground I actually joined the
04:42 - startup in Columbus Ohio called neo
04:44 - kinetics and this is this story actually
04:47 - didn't even tell the more in PT so shout
04:49 - out to them and we had to deliver this
04:52 - MVP it was basically for Assaf engineers
04:54 - with two co-founders and we basically
04:57 - had to deliver this MVP that was
05:01 - essentially a motion sensor exercise
05:03 - game for patients with parkinson's
05:06 - disease for the columbus hospital and as
05:10 - we're like you know research as I was
05:12 - researching for like what's text at what
05:14 - tech do we use we landed on c-sharp and
05:18 - the Microsoft Kinect okay and I kind of
05:23 - like fell into a rabbit hole weird
05:24 - setting you know do we use SDK one or
05:26 - SDK two so they are you tubing no
05:31 - worries just the same stayed stay in the
05:33 - stream you don't need to know too much
05:35 - for this stream but anyways as where I
05:37 - was researching Microsoft Kinect I came
05:41 - up the found this company called
05:43 - Adafruit right and at the time when I
05:46 - was undergrad you at least I did all I
05:49 - mostly only hear about due√±os and
05:51 - raspberry PI's so when I was researching
05:53 - about Microsoft Kinect which was this
05:57 - super state-of-the-art a vast relatively
06:01 - low-cost motion sensor that was
06:05 - originally developed for to be
06:06 - at gaming accessory for the Xbox 360 and
06:08 - my X Box 1 so we're did we know we're
06:14 - looking at the SDKs for that choosing
06:16 - deciding on which one we found out that
06:18 - the reason why Microsoft even released
06:21 - the open-source the sort of software
06:24 - development kit for Microsoft Kinect is
06:27 - because native through back in 2012
06:29 - Ashley did a hackathon open source
06:31 - hackathon where they basically did a
06:35 - bounty so any so they released this sort
06:37 - of hackathon for $3,000 and four of the
06:39 - whole world if you're able to hack the
06:41 - Microsoft Kinect you'll get this money
06:45 - prize so that's when I decided that's
06:49 - when I was like oh wow there's some
06:50 - companies super special on there like
06:52 - pushing that boundaries of open-source
06:54 - and Microsoft eventually actually did
06:56 - release SDKs as well as you know it's
06:58 - cool now to see like how its Microsoft
07:01 - Kinect it's actually integrated with
07:02 - their cloud platform so it's really cool
07:06 - to see like a you know a hardware
07:08 - company have such a big impact in the
07:11 - whole tech industry so this is
07:14 - definitely dream come true we actually
07:15 - cover this course with Lamar and 2pt as
07:18 - well as many other team members on
07:20 - Adafruit it's definitely a dream come
07:23 - true
07:25 - cool so can we use a tofu fried we know
07:29 - so a tofu is actually a company that
07:30 - sells I guess they also sells oh dude we
07:33 - knows but a tofu release a language
07:36 - called circuit Python which is what
07:38 - we're gonna work on today and you can
07:40 - actually program Adafruit devices in the
07:43 - hell do you know platform that I'll do
07:45 - we know IDE which is just calling it out
07:47 - there you know so this story you know
07:52 - hopefully I don't think L'Amour and
07:53 - Petey are watching right now but I'm
07:54 - probably gonna share with them to see
07:56 - like oh wow like so much has happened in
07:59 - the last four or five years you know so
08:02 - many things come around and we're
08:05 - working together with my you know my
08:06 - heroes I guess cool
08:10 - so today to celebrate the course we're
08:13 - also running a promo so if you subscribe
08:16 - to a pro annual subscription you'll
08:19 - actually receive a circuit playground
08:21 - Express today only so go check that out
08:24 - go check your email
08:27 - so which coding language are we using
08:29 - hello Elijah so we're using a language
08:31 - called circuit Python so let me scroll
08:33 - down real quick so today I'm going to
08:34 - demo some of the content in this course
08:36 - as well as a project so circuit python
08:39 - essentially expire on plus optimized for
08:43 - hardware it's a branch it's a fork a
08:45 - derivative of micro Python it's a
08:48 - programming language designed to
08:49 - simplify experimenting and learning to
08:51 - program on hardware devices it makes
08:54 - getting started with low cost
08:55 - microcontroller boards easier than ever
08:57 - before so the goal here is to actually
08:59 - build the best introductory chorus into
09:03 - Hardware programming because to be
09:04 - honest there's only two type people that
09:06 - meet people who absolutely coders who
09:09 - absolutely love hardware programming and
09:11 - also people who either haven't started
09:13 - or are intimidated by Hardware
09:15 - programming so if you have some Python
09:18 - knowledge this should be super easy for
09:19 - you if you have no experience no worries
09:23 - it's actually really easy to get started
09:24 - and this course will start with learning
09:27 - how to line up colors with circuit
09:28 - playground Express using buttons and
09:30 - there are three different projects in
09:32 - this course biplane plant care as a sort
09:36 - of automated plant system where you
09:40 - measure the temperature the moisture
09:41 - level the the light value as well as the
09:45 - 88 drum machine okay so these are super
09:48 - super cool projects okay
09:53 - so before we go into more depth let's
09:58 - actually let's just get started okay
10:04 - I'm gonna show you a quick run-through
10:07 - of maybe like the beginning of the
10:09 - course this is actually is a pro
10:11 - exclusive course so what is circuit
10:13 - Python so this little video yeah
10:17 - wouldn't you skip this let's just a few
10:19 - seconds a few seconds we know we boom we
10:21 - hit you with a video and this is a
10:25 - little more by the way she is almost
10:28 - like the face of the DIY hardware space
10:31 - definitely leading figure even when I
10:33 - was in college everybody looked up to
10:35 - her so next we have the setting up by
10:39 - the way this right here is a circuit
10:41 - play rock express this little circuit
10:43 - board right here okay it's $25 it has
10:46 - memory it has licensors life sensor
10:49 - temperature sensor motion sensor
10:51 - aceleration sensor a double tap sensor
10:54 - it can play sound it can play audio
10:56 - files it can play basic tones if you
10:59 - tell it the frequencies and the duration
11:01 - you want to get the tone it has buttons
11:03 - so you actually supposed to beat this
11:05 - way
11:06 - okay back in so I'm gonna hold this
11:09 - upside down has two buttons button a
11:12 - button B has a slight switch right here
11:14 - a reset button
11:16 - it has cap touches along the edges seven
11:18 - of them which is basically like that you
11:21 - know it detects human touch
11:24 - it has neopixels which are these sort of
11:27 - revolutionary very state-of-the-art LED
11:29 - lights where you can literally give it
11:31 - the RGB value red green blue values and
11:33 - we'll just play any colors you want
11:35 - super cool so circuit pytho hey hello
11:41 - Katie great question so circuit python
11:43 - is a programming language to be followed
11:44 - by Adafruit and circuit playground
11:46 - Express is the the circuit board the
11:50 - board this little circular device and
11:53 - Adafruit is a company that developed
11:55 - both of them please you know feel free
11:59 - to
12:02 - add some questions so he's it easier to
12:04 - learn Python after learning circuit
12:05 - Python great question
12:09 - so actually suggests if the perfect way
12:11 - is actually learned some basic Python so
12:13 - I'll say learn printing learn if
12:17 - statements and loops and then getting to
12:21 - circuit Python but because we want to
12:24 - make this course the best reductive
12:26 - course to hardware there there is
12:28 - actually no prerequisites for this
12:30 - course
12:35 - right because circuit python is
12:37 - essentially Python and place some more
12:39 - stuff cool so setting up so here are
12:44 - some items in the course where you test
12:45 - your USB download the circuit python
12:47 - from this file it's already downloaded
12:49 - and I plugged it in to my computer right
12:51 - here through a USB
12:59 - and after we played it in there should
13:02 - be something called a circuit PI Drive
13:03 - the volume or disk drive whatever you
13:05 - want to call it appear on your desktop
13:07 - right here it's all caps circuit PI an
13:11 - inside circuit PI there's two files well
13:14 - when you first actually load in the
13:15 - circuit python you start so you'll only
13:16 - one file the boot underscore file.txt
13:19 - a text file and inside it there is just
13:21 - basically some meta information about
13:24 - the version of the circuit python that
13:26 - you have not too important but the next
13:29 - file next to it the code a PI a Python
13:32 - file is the most important file
13:34 - so the code opcode PI actually controls
13:39 - the circuit playground Express okay so
13:43 - anytime you save it the board actually
13:44 - restarts it keeps running this file over
13:47 - and over again okay so in this course
13:49 - we're gonna basically update the code
13:50 - inside this file so that we change
13:53 - whatever this does so Anju Larsen if we
13:57 - sign up a pro annual membership today
13:59 - what was being thrown in so you if you
14:01 - sign up for pro Nia subscription today
14:03 - subscription today prescription I'm not
14:05 - sure what this is Ashley what you'll get
14:08 - in the door to an extra circuit
14:10 - playground Express mailed to your door
14:16 - okay cool
14:18 - so let's get started to show you a
14:22 - little preview of the course here we
14:25 - have a brief intro circuit playground
14:27 - Express is a perfect introduction to
14:29 - electronics and programming it has a
14:32 - built in USB support meaning you can
14:34 - plug into programming then the program
14:38 - just shows up no special cable or
14:40 - adapter adapter required just program
14:42 - your code into co-pi on this board and
14:46 - take you on the go and here in this
14:49 - course we're used circuit Python okay
14:57 - all right could this work as a Raspberry
14:59 - Pi hmm it's a great question so
15:02 - Raspberry Pi is essentially a mini
15:03 - computer whereas it has its own
15:05 - operating system right
15:06 - whereas this right here it's actually
15:10 - not a computer this is purely a circuit
15:13 - board okay which way is easier to get
15:20 - started I would say probably this right
15:21 - here and then you learn Raspberry Pi or
15:24 - do we know okay the reason why this was
15:28 - made was because we're trying to make it
15:29 - as easy as possible so what the learning
15:33 - difficulty of learning curves I always
15:35 - have with power programming is learning
15:39 - about the tech specs
15:40 - okay learning about all the different
15:41 - parts that's on each circuit board so
15:44 - right here we actually made a super
15:47 - super cool visualization shout out to
15:49 - Nick that's another CDF here who
15:53 - actually inspired me to go check on
15:56 - learn to Co a great course essentially
16:00 - you can hover over different parts of
16:01 - the bore and learn about the different
16:02 - parts right here we have an on button a
16:05 - green LED indicates that circuit breaker
16:08 - is powered right here this is upside
16:12 - down by the way okay here's a real red
16:15 - LED here are oh I'm sorry
16:21 - whoops oh sorry about that everybody so
16:26 - right here green on LED indicates the
16:31 - circuit pretty brown Express is powered
16:33 - on here is the d13 the red LED use for
16:37 - basic blinking this is usually sometimes
16:39 - used for the holo version of the
16:44 - hardware version of hello world right we
16:45 - get into blink to test it to debug it
16:47 - here are the neopixels along the edges
16:51 - here we have a push button be a push
16:55 - button a a reset button speaker cap
17:01 - touches along the edges cool there's
17:03 - actually two ways to to output sound one
17:06 - is through this little built-in mini
17:08 - speaker and the other
17:09 - way is actually you connect the a zero
17:11 - cap touch the a zero sorry the pin to a
17:15 - real speaker so you don't want you know
17:19 - you annoy your neighbors with it okay so
17:22 - after you learn all the different cool
17:26 - parts that come with this little board
17:28 - we get into our first programmable
17:30 - exercise so we'll learn about neopixels
17:32 - how to make these lights up here okay so
17:36 - neopixels are a revolution revolutionary
17:39 - and ultra popular way to add lights and
17:42 - color to your project these full color
17:44 - RGB lights red green blue lights at the
17:47 - controller inside the LED so you can
17:49 - just push the RGB RGB data to your
17:51 - device and LEDs will do all the work for
17:54 - you so they're programmable and circuit
17:57 - playback Express has ten of these okay
18:00 - so ten different lights inside each neo
18:03 - neo pixel there are actually three LEDs
18:06 - the are the G and blue and each LED is
18:10 - controllable by the circuit next to it
18:12 - which acts like a brain so to do this
18:15 - with code we actually first have to
18:19 - import the Adafruit underscore circuit
18:22 - playground I expressed library import
18:24 - the CPX which stands for is circuit play
18:27 - guy express GPX cool and all the
18:33 - neopixels can be lit to the same color
18:35 - specified using the CP X pixels dot fill
18:39 - function ok here's a function with the
18:41 - Perthes set of parentheses and the color
18:44 - that we want will go inside this
18:46 - parentheses right here so it should give
18:48 - you an example red is actually to 5500
18:53 - okay are sorry rgb2 5500 and 0 means
19:01 - fully off 255 is fully on right so
19:04 - there's 19 to 50 2056
19:06 - numbers so if we want to make all this
19:10 - colors of the circuit board Express
19:13 - circuit playground Express red we all we
19:16 - need to do is do this function here CPX
19:18 - top pixels fill parentheses inside
19:21 - inside this parentheses is actually a
19:23 - tuple of the RGB values so notice
19:26 - there's actually two sets of parentheses
19:28 - a little tuple RGB value that's been
19:32 - closed by the parentheses right here
19:34 - cool and to turn all the neopixels red
19:39 - forever you actually need an infinite
19:41 - while loop they repeatedly execute the
19:44 - code inside over and over again right
19:46 - while true the code inside is executed
19:49 - once Wow true yes it is true I see you
19:53 - again again again it's just basically an
19:54 - infinite wild cool so Gregory what would
19:58 - this course practically prepare me for
20:00 - so that's actually a great point so if
20:02 - you're into for something I almost
20:05 - always believe in is you know people
20:07 - always say is practice practice practice
20:08 - is sometimes practice can get you know
20:10 - you'll burn out right you know sometimes
20:13 - when I use a lot of other other
20:14 - platforms we're just you know Joe Joe
20:17 - you with you know a bunch of code
20:19 - challenges over and over again you
20:22 - definitely start to get a little bit
20:23 - bored and sometimes what I like to do
20:25 - when I'm learning to code is try to use
20:27 - the same language for different things
20:29 - so Python for example you can build a
20:33 - terminal program you can do machine
20:34 - learning NLP which ii learned you could
20:37 - with ltk with NLP you can do pandas for
20:42 - data manipulation data retrieval you can
20:47 - visualize data with matplotlib and these
20:49 - are all Python right you can build a web
20:52 - basically like a web developer with
20:55 - python with django and flask and you can
20:59 - do this right here which is robotics
21:02 - hardware wearables electronics circuit
21:05 - python so I usually try to use the same
21:10 - language in different light I tackle it
21:12 - from different angles so that I'll
21:13 - always be building interesting stuff and
21:16 - not burn out
21:17 - bored oh and this is what death will
21:21 - make if you do this you'll definitely
21:23 - become a stronger programmer okay so
21:29 - let's try this out in this exercise
21:31 - we're gonna light up the circuit
21:32 - playground Express first thing first
21:34 - let's import a module we already did
21:36 - let's click run very nice turn green so
21:39 - to light it up forever
21:41 - we'll need a while loop that will never
21:42 - end so let's add a while loop while true
21:45 - remember in Python in tation is very
21:48 - important unlike a lot of the other
21:49 - languages so I've added two spaces right
21:52 - here one two and inside the while loop
21:55 - let's pick a color
21:58 - so span and chat let's do a color first
22:02 - one give me a color everybody
22:09 - any color
22:14 - come on chat
22:19 - cool let's do that how do you pronounce
22:21 - this word cyan cyan cool cyan RGB
22:32 - ok so 0 255 255 right here very cool
22:38 - so while true let's add that in we're
22:41 - gonna use the CPS stuff pixels dot fill
22:44 - inside I remember we to do a 2-tuple is
22:47 - this 0 255 255 I think so cool hit run
22:53 - it passes so now we actually want to
22:57 - move the code from the code Academy
22:59 - co-editor onto the circuit playground
23:02 - Express right so how do we do that
23:05 - the download button this time
23:12 - harm your computer keep oh whoops click
23:15 - the run boats down a long time keep okay
23:18 - we down it to add a level voter right
23:21 - here whoops
23:29 - let's to leave this one let's try one
23:31 - more time download keep
23:41 - whoops open and finder cool so this is
23:44 - the file we want we're gonna be dragged
23:45 - into code pi let's delete this one
23:51 - there's actually a easier way to do this
23:52 - I'm going to show you how later code pie
23:56 - cool save it
23:59 - cyan you can't not really see this in
24:02 - this I guess this is a green screen
24:05 - behind us that's why you can't see the
24:07 - little bit glitchy but all the colors
24:09 - appear it in cyan can you move a little
24:13 - to your left please yes sorry about that
24:15 - wait left or right this way cool
24:26 - awesome
24:29 - now that you've downloaded the code how
24:31 - long will it continue to run it will
24:33 - actually run forever until it runs out
24:35 - of memory a battery but because it's
24:40 - powered by the computer actually will
24:43 - never run out battery so if you actually
24:45 - do this with a if you actually add a
24:48 - tripple battery a triple a battery pack
24:50 - right here it will eventually run a
24:52 - battery but we're using energy it looks
24:56 - like a lightsaber
24:57 - eight-zero cool alright everybody so now
25:02 - I give you a little quick demo there's a
25:05 - lot of more to this course let's do a
25:07 - project real quick okay we're not gonna
25:09 - get into the size switch the buttons amb
25:10 - let's just do a little well Rodney
25:14 - dependently up the computer if you have
25:15 - a battery pack yes so you can plug the
25:18 - USB the code will still be on the board
25:20 - you put a battery pack into it let's go
25:22 - play a battery pack and there we go
25:30 - cool alright let's go back let's show
25:33 - you a cool project that we can do so
25:38 - there are actually three different
25:38 - projects in this course a bike leg and
25:40 - we actually hand-picked them cuz I
25:42 - usually like to have them sort of
25:44 - triangle you know the trio of projects
25:47 - at like cover different a wide variety
25:49 - of projects topics so the first one is
25:52 - by Clay SEC one is a plant automated
25:55 - system where you measure the temperature
25:56 - measure the moisture level measure the
26:00 - light value you plot it you pay said I
26:02 - see the the temperature variations
26:07 - during the day and the last one is a
26:09 - drum machine using fruits so today our
26:13 - from our Bach and Hannah buddies on
26:17 - Academy team basically told me to do the
26:21 - bike project okay so let's do this real
26:23 - quick it's actually the first project in
26:24 - this course before we get started let's
26:26 - to leave this works basically you
26:27 - actually don't see the code cool
26:35 - all right
26:39 - so the bike light project it's your
26:42 - first day as a hardware designer your
26:45 - first task is to create a customizable
26:48 - bike light for the guy from Brooklyn New
26:50 - York a delivery man that relies on his
26:53 - bike to get you started on your research
26:56 - your boss left a circuit playbacks press
26:58 - on your desk there's numerous inputs and
27:02 - neopixels for lights how fragile is this
27:05 - device it's actually pretty decent I've
27:07 - been carried in my pocket for least six
27:09 - months now dropped it multiple times
27:11 - still fine crit Zoe is in the chat cool
27:21 - create a customizable bike light for
27:23 - your client you will look at how you can
27:24 - define colors in code and use that to
27:26 - make some flying missions with neopixels
27:28 - what are you waiting for
27:29 - let's get started so here's a sigma
27:32 - disclaimer do not use at your soul by
27:34 - plane this is actually pretty strong but
27:36 - just in case you know you should have
27:37 - your to find them back not sure what's
27:39 - the New York law for this but more the
27:42 - better right cool so first things first
27:48 - listen for the module that we need so
27:50 - Adafruit underscore circuit playground
27:52 - Express there are actually two ways to
27:55 - program a circular bearings for us one
27:57 - is using this module this library with a
27:59 - bunch of functions in it the CPX
28:01 - functions but it's not great for a
28:04 - memory management force it's not great
28:06 - for the more lower level computing that
28:09 - you want to do so there's actually
28:10 - another set of functions that you can
28:11 - learn a little bit later about if you
28:13 - take this course so you have more
28:16 - control over the analog pins
28:23 - okay so circuit playground has 10
28:28 - built-in neopixels the neopixels are
28:30 - number of clock counterclockwise from 0
28:32 - to 9 for example to make the needle
28:35 - pixels read every base to do a live look
28:39 - so i actually skip this and when i did
28:41 - the lesson demo this is actually a later
28:43 - exercise but instead of using the CPX
28:46 - fail function you can actually specify
28:50 - individually each how each which color
28:54 - to give each of the the neopixels right
28:56 - so I'm still doing CP exfil blah the
29:00 - color for all to turn all of them to a
29:02 - single color - Li do basically 10 of
29:05 - these index serie give it a red color
29:08 - index 1 you give it a blue color index 2
29:11 - you have a orange color you know make a
29:13 - rainbow whatever you want okay so this
29:16 - code so this code right here
29:33 - we'll turn all the neopixels to red and
29:37 - this code right here specify only the
29:43 - neopixel index zero take off the outer
29:46 - parentheses so this co right here
29:48 - actually specify it to turn only one of
29:51 - them neopixel but in neopixel index 0 to
29:53 - red ok so two different functions a
29:56 - couple with it cool so there's two way
30:02 - to do this one is to do I'm gonna show
30:05 - you that the longer way to make all the
30:11 - colors into red remember I just showed
30:14 - you you can either do this to 5500 is
30:25 - right
30:28 - oh I am NOT a fan of these hotkeys are
30:35 - really small so basically you can do
30:37 - like two three four five to nine so
30:40 - right here I made if I you know let's do
30:43 - the circuit board Express I made six of
30:45 - the neopixel into red but if I want to
30:48 - make all of them read you can refactor
30:49 - your code to just be when I showed you
30:51 - in the lesson CPI stop pixels dot fill
31:00 - cool hit save
31:03 - download the code
31:10 - Oh
31:15 - we'll just keep this window of this code
31:18 - into the circuit board this
31:25 - go got pie and now the whole thing is
31:29 - red cool let's continue
31:39 - check this box check this box check the
31:44 - spot where you factored the code got it
31:47 - to the board
31:47 - red lights your pure very nice so the on
31:52 - and off switch the second phase so now
31:54 - you have something working you show your
31:55 - product manager the prototype this
31:57 - little scenario we can't blow more I
31:58 - came up with great work the lights are
32:00 - nice and bright but that will mean that
32:02 - the batteries were drained while the
32:04 - Bicas part the Quarrier is making
32:05 - deliveries
32:06 - can we add can we add an on and off
32:10 - switch
32:11 - this will conserve battery so it lasts
32:14 - all day so let the phase to begin before
32:20 - I move on to the part 2 anybody have any
32:22 - questions so we just got the whole
32:27 - neopixels all the neopixels to turn red
32:39 - cool no question so the circuit
32:42 - playground Express has a slight whistle
32:44 - I switch right here right underneath the
32:48 - the reset button inside the while loop
32:52 - so actually we can use a slide which to
32:55 - make an on and off button basically we
32:56 - can do slice which is the left will go
32:59 - read your side switch to the right
33:03 - it's it turns off okay so inside the
33:07 - while loop let's run it if same a
33:09 - conditional statement that turns all the
33:10 - neopixels red when CPX is on its left so
33:18 - wow it's true
33:19 - if CPX switch it's true so you can't
33:24 - even do this way or you can do it before
33:26 - you go to chew and we're gonna end this
33:32 - the code on line five to make it inside
33:34 - the if statement okay I'm gonna click
33:36 - Save
33:39 - next let's add an else statement that
33:41 - turns all the neopixels off
33:44 - so if CPS not switch it go to true would
33:47 - travel to the red else one we're gonna
33:50 - turn to off and how do you turn it off
33:53 - well you just do zero zero zero a tuple
33:57 - of three to put zeros safe is it
34:03 - possible hello gaming gamer is it
34:06 - possible to add external Assessors to it
34:08 - absolutely you can actually connect cap
34:11 - touches to fruits to other sensors yeah
34:18 - go check on the Adafruit comm to see a
34:20 - bunch of stuff that you can do with this
34:21 - with external sensors capacitive touch
34:28 - these things around
34:31 - on the other edge Marielle sunny may
34:36 - even cover some of that maybe ya public
34:41 -  Zoe cap touch ya shout out to
34:46 - Marriott Zoe
34:49 - cool let's see if this worked so save
34:53 - download I almost want to show you how
34:58 - to do this the easy way but well
35:09 - move this into the circuit by volume or
35:11 - drive delete this
35:18 - cool
35:22 - loaded the code onto the board so let's
35:24 - see right now it's on let's turn the
35:26 - slide switch and now it's off on off
35:33 - slide switch on slice switch off very
35:37 - cool cool so you show this to your
35:43 - client part three you show this your
35:45 - client he loves it was but he asks is
35:48 - there any way I can make it blink so
35:51 - python has a time dot sleep function
35:53 - from the time of
35:54 - to use it you must first add this live
35:57 - code to the top import time actually you
36:01 - start doing him for Thomas to from time
36:04 - in course okay then to make the program
36:10 - holder sleep and this actually allows to
36:12 - use a sleep function which allows us to
36:15 - hold the program for an excellent number
36:17 - amount of seconds or sleep the program
36:21 - for X number of seconds how do you get
36:26 - the free hardware I'm not finding that
36:27 - when I go to the sign up page so you
36:29 - should get an email little cute girl you
36:30 - should get an email today this morning
36:31 - on the details how to do it yeah and
36:36 - Alex right here we'll put a link in the
36:38 - chat so you can sign up for this yeah
36:42 - let us know what you think let me know
36:44 - what you think now if you take the quiz
36:47 - cool so we added the sleep library and
36:51 - now let's change the code so that it
36:54 - turned the neopixels read sleep for fun
36:57 - 0.5 seconds and then we turn the
36:58 - neopixels off okay
37:03 - so let's do this when a slice which is
37:06 - to the left when I turn it on turn it
37:08 - red they're gonna sleep it beside the
37:11 - parenthese when it is 0.5 number of
37:14 - seconds and then I'm going to turn it
37:17 - off CPI stop pixels fill
37:26 - cool but yes let's test the blinking
37:29 - click download to download the code app
37:31 - I see let's download it
37:45 - I messed up I should have definitely
37:46 - showed this earlier how to change the
37:48 - setting of your download button delete
37:53 - it change it to code up I cool now we're
37:57 - good let's see sighs switch whoops just
38:04 - absolutely hit the reset button let's
38:05 - double click it
38:10 - you see this
38:21 - cool so something is a little weird is
38:23 - happening it's not holding for 0.5
38:26 - seconds okay let's go down so why is it
38:30 - blinking like the way we wanted to blink
38:33 - off blink oh well let's walk through the
38:37 - code one more time
38:38 - so inside our code we actually turn the
38:41 - neopixels read slept it for 0.5 seconds
38:44 - and then we turn it off and the loop
38:46 - ends and we go back to the top again
38:48 - okay
38:49 - the wait after we turn the neopixels we
38:53 - never let it hold for sleep for sometime
38:55 - after we turn it off for the blink we
38:58 - actually never let a holder sleep for
39:00 - sometime
39:01 - and a while loop go back to the
39:02 - beginning and the neopixels turn read
39:04 - again that's where you see this weird
39:05 - not consistent blinking can you see this
39:09 - okay so this actually is super telling
39:12 - at stake and all it is is we add a sleep
39:16 - function after so so this is actually
39:22 - really interesting and this actually I
39:24 - didn't really you know connect the dots
39:26 - but when you're developing hardware when
39:31 - you're doing hardware design the code is
39:32 - actually a lot shorter right like the
39:34 - software part just with the software
39:35 - development part is actually a small
39:37 - part of it l'amour tell told us this
39:40 - when we met went over to the office and
39:43 - it's usually really hard to pinpoint we
39:45 - do software debugging compared to
39:49 - Hardware debugging it's actually a lot
39:50 - tougher to find that error right you got
39:52 - a zero this is a hardware problem this
39:54 - is a software problem they're actually
39:56 - two separate world of things that you
39:59 - got to check for and that's why we left
40:02 - a sort of a bug scenario scenario for
40:04 - you to exploit let's save it one more
40:08 - time download
40:18 - keep
40:21 - cool let's move it to circuit pipe
40:25 - delete this
40:29 - Giroud up high cool here we go on ah ah
40:38 - do you see how it's more consistent not
40:40 - like this faster on I like longer on and
40:43 - a shorter off it's a slight consistent
40:45 - on sleeper 0.25 second Oh a second
40:50 - very cool Bryant looters off Todd big
40:55 - but when you plan to add more advanced
40:58 - opposites ooh chocolate so I think we're
40:59 - working alright right now Zoey and Nick
41:01 - are two fellow C dubs I think soon next
41:11 - kill a month okay within the next couple
41:12 - of like before May I remember I saw the
41:15 - yeah we'll see called don't don't be
41:20 - afraid to jump back answer that or Zoey
41:25 - or Nick there we go
41:27 - Sonny's right we're cool sorry about
41:29 - that
41:32 - very cool so now you learn how to do
41:34 - this you can add more you can do a
41:37 - rainbow color you can do a faster blink
41:40 - if you press a or just slower blink if
41:42 - you press B so hopefully you know some
41:48 - of you will sign up for the course take
41:50 - this course work on the code a little
41:54 - bit and then send us your projects and
41:58 - if it's really cool will actually show
42:00 - this to the world by adding your project
42:02 - to the last step the last check point of
42:05 - this project very cool so in your fruit
42:11 - so code Academy XA tofu is finally
42:13 - happened wanted you know a hardware
42:15 - course on code kami years ago before I
42:17 - joined the team it's just been a crazy
42:21 - you know it's almost like the last year
42:23 - and have it's almost like dog years
42:26 - you go through CDs it's been a blur but
42:29 - super super happy to see this on our
42:31 - platform any questions any questions
42:35 - Hardware related whatever you later
42:38 - career related code can be related this
42:44 - is your time if you join this if you
42:49 - join the stream a little bit late if you
42:51 - sign up for a pro subscription today
42:55 - they in your plan you actually get the
42:57 - circumflex press in the mail for free
43:08 - kyun anytime
43:16 - anybody questions questions questions
43:30 - my name is it law so Ryan gamer my name
43:34 - on tick-tock is blah your username on
43:37 - the tick tock app who will sit on the
43:40 - Iron Throne actually I actually didn't
43:42 - get to watch Game of Thrones last night
43:43 - because I was polishing this but tonight
43:46 - I'm definitely at lunch at first episode
43:49 - thank you thank you
43:50 - one vtec can you program with std what's
43:53 - SCD standard I'll do me no code STD not
43:59 - sure so yeah you can actually program
44:00 - this the circuit playground and the
44:02 - circuit player I express using out doing
44:03 - a ID not sure if that's a question so if
44:07 - I set up a pro what other extra things
44:09 - can I learn from the above free courses
44:11 - right so our pro course is currently our
44:14 - pro membership currently offer a variety
44:16 - of different courses learn Python 3
44:18 - machine learning and every course will
44:23 - have projects and quizzes that you can
44:24 - happen to see for example icy pond
44:26 - supplies every single module every
44:28 - single lesson has three different
44:30 - products that accompanies it so that's
44:32 - like an easy project a middle project
44:34 - and a difficult project there's also a
44:39 - CLL community a slack channel where all
44:43 - the Poorna learners can help one other
44:44 - to grow to debug to to answer each
44:47 - other's questions to to be motivated
45:00 - what is the simplest programming code to
45:02 - start learning hello Carlos
45:04 - I seem to hop in a different one that's
45:06 - a never get far as I feel a bit
45:08 - overwhelmed interesting so this is
45:10 - actually a very common thing you're
45:13 - gonna feel as you know so Carlos are you
45:16 - a are you a are you self-taught
45:19 - programmer are you in going for a CS
45:22 - program or are you in a boot camp before
45:25 - I can answer this like before I can help
45:26 - you I need to learn a little bit more
45:29 - how does this compare to Raspberry Pi so
45:31 - this is actually not a mini-computer
45:33 - does it have like Wi-Fi we connect
45:36 - connect to where as Raspberry Pi is
45:39 - basically its own little mini computer
45:41 - with this operating system for a
45:43 - hackathon actually at KU kami Marielle
45:47 - Zoe to my teammates here Ashley worked
45:50 - on a welcome bot for our code camis main
45:54 - interest for office basically when you
45:55 - go in we're still like trying to debug
45:56 - that right now
45:57 - but you know when you go in you can
45:59 - actually hear an mp3 file of suave our
46:02 - team members saying hello welcome to
46:04 - cope get me in the morning
46:06 - it's basically this sort of like a
46:08 - breath of air you know or like this sort
46:11 - of I guess it's like this prayer before
46:13 - you get on office sometimes like when do
46:15 - your unless you're not having a great
46:17 - day sometimes your own set you
46:26 - self-taught so Carl stop talk call so
46:28 - this is actually a very common thing
46:29 - especially when you're self-taught is
46:32 - protamine is basically like the CEO of
46:34 - information it's always expanding
46:36 - expanding and growing evolving right so
46:38 - to keep up is one thing but like to even
46:39 - get started learning is a completely
46:42 - different a very tough thing to do right
46:45 - it's like same thing as you learn when I
46:48 - say like same thing as you learn German
46:50 - or Japanese what I would do is try to
46:52 - program as much as possible
46:53 - it doesn't happy you know you gotta find
46:56 - your own personal learning style right
46:58 - like for some people it's like code a
47:00 - little bit every single day for me it's
47:02 - like I do these sprits where I just go
47:04 - ham and just wait I just like code
47:10 - non-stop for a week and then just rest
47:11 - for a little bit yeah it's an
47:15 - interesting thing I don't I think just
47:17 - tap try to you know emerge yourself with
47:20 - as much learning it's possible on
47:21 - different platforms on multiple
47:23 - different various different plans to
47:24 - figure out what your videos the best who
47:25 - frees you to code kami like this
47:27 - interactiveness and also meet people and
47:32 - actually another thing that I'll say is
47:33 - do this it's hard to get those small
47:37 - wins and those big wins in programming
47:39 - when you're doing it early on so you
47:40 - know build your own little program super
47:43 - early on and also try to find a team
47:45 - that some so actually we had a an on
47:49 - site sort of like a meet-up event a week
47:54 - ago where actually somebody asked me
47:55 - that and asked me like what was my
47:58 - biggest win and my biggest win is
48:00 - probably when I made something real when
48:02 - I worked at neo kinetics where just for
48:03 - people like people here at Co kami
48:05 - actually hops more time on this a little
48:06 - earlier people like you think I've
48:08 - worked really hard at code kami but we
48:10 - didn't know it's before it go get me ice
48:12 - so pretty much so my soul you know
48:14 - teaching and even before that when I
48:17 - worked on neo kinetic steam for for
48:19 - three and a half months
48:20 - it was just I cut it I cut off social
48:24 - media that cut off it was just literally
48:26 - for 3-4 months non-stop working and that
48:30 - and I think I learned more in those 3-4
48:32 - months that I've learned in my whole
48:34 - first two years of college outside
48:38 - and you you know you shut out to author
48:42 - who taught me who like mentored me and
48:45 - taught me a c-sharp taught me just you
48:51 - know there are definitely moments where
48:53 - it was definitely not struggle there or
48:54 - like we slept and then computer lab but
48:58 - now looking back I still got one more of
49:01 - those in me you know you know I stood it
49:04 - was just a really good time and I
49:06 - learned so much because I had this sort
49:08 - of mentor it was a little bit older than
49:10 - me and yeah so another question oh
49:20 - you're all gonna do other streams on
49:21 - this hardware at curriculum I'm not sure
49:23 - if depends on if people take this course
49:26 - who knows if you like it to you this
49:28 - will has snow give us feedback share our
49:30 - Twitter share on social media and if you
49:33 - like it we might do some others to cool
49:34 - stuff later Carlos for sure yeah just
49:38 - keep doing it if it's easy you'll be
49:41 - boring telling you I tell everybody list
49:43 - if it's easy it would be really boring
49:45 - you know the one reason why I got in
49:47 - tech is because there's your sniffing
49:50 - amount information to learn it's
49:54 - you slowly get into it and and I I
49:56 - really don't like that you know the
49:57 - phrase like fake it till you make it
49:59 - just just learn it if you don't know it
50:01 - just learn it don't ya that's not and it
50:09 - builds up everything you do builds up
50:11 - and that's another thing
50:13 - can I go freelance with Pro yes yes how
50:16 - fast so if it depends on what you want
50:17 - to do hello Katie this is a question
50:19 - from Katie freelance with Pro so depends
50:23 - on what you want to do for I think the
50:24 - low the lowest level entry for the tech
50:28 - industry is probably web developing did
50:30 - Alice this sort of entry-level junior
50:33 - level positions and I'll say I've seen
50:38 - in CL community the SAC channel
50:40 - community like there are people who
50:41 - found a job after 10 8 8 to 10 months
50:45 - but with that you have to network you
50:47 - have to connect the people you got to
50:49 - have a thick skin and then thanks again
50:50 - right thick skin is for to reach out to
50:53 - people in this case like you have this
50:54 - level of trying to hit this level of
50:58 - quality
51:09 - okay army 95c spec I'm a sysadmin an
51:13 - infrastructure guy and have always been
51:14 - Durst and programming touch some of your
51:16 - free courses well this possibly be a
51:17 - good transition is that support hardware
51:18 - currently yeah absolutely I think this
51:20 - will be a great and super fun and like
51:22 - course to get into Python right circuit
51:27 - Python Python they hopefully will spark
51:30 - and this I always tell people this like
51:32 - everything build on code Academy are
51:35 - this points you can build a game you can
51:36 - build a webpage you can build a data
51:40 - visualization but it's all constrained
51:42 - by this sort of monitor and when you see
51:44 - your code come to life and hopefully you
51:46 - know it lights up this light up your
51:48 - inner fire similar to like you know when
51:50 - you open up a Lego box for Christmas
51:52 - when you're a kid and hopefully you're
51:54 - like okay this is actually not too bad
51:56 - this is actually super addictive super
51:58 - fly super magical please please share if
52:06 - you work on this course please share us
52:08 - like show us what school stuff you build
52:09 - they're actually so many different
52:11 - things they can build with this so
52:17 - alright everybody so this yeah so sunny
52:26 - you keep you keep answering questions so
52:28 - I'm I'm Alex I've never done any
52:31 - hardware stuff before but I was watching
52:33 - sunny stream and so I wanted to so I
52:38 - know Python a little bit and so I want
52:41 - to play around with the colors so you
52:42 - get the colors to change every time so
52:44 - it's Donny you keep answering questions
52:45 - okay I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna
52:49 - see see what what else we can write this
52:53 - so this is a kind of shame that I always
52:56 - that we personal yeah so keep asking
53:01 - questions I will I don't do this so it's
53:05 - telling my idea is that okay what's have
53:08 - a variable for red and then each time
53:10 - through this loop increase that variable
53:12 - by one mm-hmm interesting so you
53:17 - basically set so the RGB value
53:20 - g/b value you set the art as like a
53:23 - bearable
53:24 - yeah increments like throw some green
53:26 - there call that's cool and then we'll
53:29 - also do do you want to explain what
53:35 - modulus um so you know we could so what
53:41 - so on line 14 oh and I'm like way in the
53:43 - way so live 14 you see a little
53:46 - percentage symbol if you haven't program
53:48 - in Python or some other general-purpose
53:50 - prime modulus symbol it returns to
53:53 - remainder so it finds basically we're
53:55 - dividing read the variable by 255 and
54:01 - whatever is a remainder what is the
54:03 - leftover is returned okay so for modulo
54:07 - 245 to there's a remainder of 0 so it
54:09 - zeroes return 5 modulo 2 yeah so the
54:16 - idea here is that we're gonna start red
54:19 - at 0 every time through the loop red is
54:22 - going to increase by 1 so it's gonna get
54:25 - more and more and more red and then when
54:28 - red hits 256 it's gonna go back down to
54:32 - 0 so we're never gonna have anything
54:34 - more than 255 and the idea here is that
54:36 - you're signing show me how to show me
54:38 - how to do this yeah so if I download it
54:41 - yeah yeah we can show them the school
54:44 - yeah let's keep answering questions
54:47 - though call so you basically move
54:50 - whatever it's downloads yeah
54:59 - cool army 95 CSC spec there's so many
55:04 - options out there have not so many
55:06 - programming options and I've not picked
55:08 - a path on which language I want to
55:09 - dedicate my state up yeah so this is
55:11 - actually a very interesting thing I
55:13 - actually always tell me about just don't
55:14 - we always have this grand vision like
55:17 - hey I want to be you know I want to
55:18 - master this programming language I think
55:20 - just when you start out learn try out
55:25 - test out you know dabble in multiple
55:27 - different languages figure out their
55:29 - domain that you want to you know want to
55:31 - work in don't care about you know how
55:32 - much money you gonna make don't care
55:34 - about any of that what makes you
55:35 - enjoying like what makes you get you
55:38 - going what like makes you tick
55:40 - right whether it's game development
55:41 - whether it's making data visualization
55:43 - interactive data services is a 3d game
55:45 - developer it's a 2-d game element do you
55:46 - want to do in unity or a VR or AR or do
55:49 - you want to do it for HTML based like a
55:53 - web browser browser based video game you
55:55 - know do you want to build a GUI app a
55:58 - desktop app do you want a bit build a
56:00 - mobile like figure these things these
56:02 - things out first and then you know
56:05 - dabble a little bit make sure that's the
56:07 - right one and just double down on that
56:09 - but before you double down on like a
56:13 - single language I would say just try out
56:14 - different different things you don't
56:17 - know what's your favorite what's your
56:18 - thing to try um let's see Emily said how
56:26 - is a deferred different from Arduino is
56:27 - it better
56:29 - Wow so so so so I'll do you know has
56:35 - been around for a while and Adafruit
56:36 - actually sells this again different
56:38 - words start to play toys for us I think
56:40 - we said a fruit from Emily yeah yeah so
56:44 - you know for even when I was undergrad
56:47 - there are basically two companies that
56:48 - are like the pillars of hardwood space
56:51 - do you know where as bait pie and if it
56:53 - became kind of like came around
56:54 - underneath and start gaining momentum
56:58 - but basically for me I'll do he knows
57:01 - they're razmik I were always like super
57:03 - difficult to like to get started on
57:05 - right and it's always intended like I
57:08 - remember you my web apps lab we've built
57:09 - door unlocking well Gino back the day
57:12 - there was no tutorials really online
57:14 - like two to five of these sort of how to
57:17 - get started and Adafruit came around
57:19 - selling raspberry pies manufacturing and
57:21 - Reno's and selling stocking different
57:25 - circuit boards and the reason why they
57:27 - came out with this is that they want to
57:29 - make the easiest the most easiest
57:33 - perfect way to get you to get started so
57:35 - they build its circuit board and they
57:37 - build they develop this program in which
57:39 - go circuit like that so it's basically a
57:41 - little easier and also a tofu's our
57:43 - neighbors they're eight blocks away also
57:45 - located in Soho yeah that's a good
57:50 - question yeah there's a ton of computer
57:51 - occupy definitely worse to open to what
58:00 - kind of support will be available when
58:02 - I'm attempting to learn this so so
58:06 - that's a question from a are you tubing
58:08 - like how to how to get help learning
58:11 - this I think one of the one of the
58:14 - things that we offer with the pro
58:16 - subscription is access to the CLL which
58:20 - is a slack community where people can
58:24 - post questions or talk to each other
58:27 - about what they're working on the sunny
58:28 - put on a the C++ what was it called a
58:34 - community challenge where people worked
58:36 - together so that's a good space that
58:39 - we're trying to make that where people
58:41 - can work together and help debug each
58:44 - other's projects things like that yeah
58:47 - and don't forget the forums to and
58:48 - Facebook as well
58:49 - nick says okay sunny so my idea was see
58:57 - if this works
58:58 - I don't know I don't know if the green
59:02 - screen is okay so we should actually I
59:09 - don't think that's working so I changed
59:14 - the code here too so this is kind of a
59:17 - good example of how this kind of
59:20 - hardware we
59:23 - can help teach Python where what I'm
59:26 - doing now is I took out the the blinking
59:31 - look at that blinking and so I'm just
59:33 - making this loop increase red by one
59:35 - each time and so as you as a result over
59:37 - time the color the color won't change
59:39 - where it starts where red is zero and
59:41 - then eventually red will get up to 255
59:43 - cool
59:44 - and just to make this laser can we do
59:46 - yeah we can do that yeah so this code is
59:48 - basically doing this right here so let's
59:50 - just focus let's just zoom in on these
59:53 - three lines okay yeah and even even this
59:57 - line where we create red cool right so
60:00 - red starts at zero so when the program
60:03 - starts and again my face is in the way
60:05 - which is annoying red is zero green is
60:09 - 100 blue is zero and then as the program
60:13 - runs red increases and increases and
60:15 - increases which change the color over
60:17 - time yeah so I don't know I love this
60:20 - sort of hardware stuff because you know
60:23 - even if you've never coded before in
60:25 - Python this is a cool little example of
60:26 - how variables can be used right cool
60:30 - yeah
60:32 - should we try we should try make all we
60:39 - can do random let's do okay we're like a
60:43 - little bit over time one last little
60:46 - demo so we're gonna first I don't know
60:49 - how to get a random number in Python
60:50 - let's look it up that's just yeah but
60:54 - let's let's check and also I'm gonna
60:58 - like make us smaller because we were
61:00 - huge my face is constantly in the way of
61:04 - this keep answering questions sunny is
61:07 - do we also get a mentor
61:10 - great question Katie so
61:16 - so I'll say in the CIO community you
61:18 - should just always ask questions anytime
61:20 - you have a bug in under confused by any
61:22 - sort of topic and we also have something
61:25 - called code coaches you might just have
61:29 - to Google this cooked which is code
61:30 - Academy that and they're also like I
61:34 - think by our by half hour sessions where
61:37 - you can like we'll do a one-on-one
61:38 - session video chat with a expert any
61:43 - domain how did I I thought code kami
61:49 - explanations were not that y'all got to
61:50 - leave code sunny how do you any sleep
61:58 - it's just sleep for sleep 0.5 yes
62:10 - bro what
62:14 - I already upload code to the adafruit so
62:17 - you basically download actually you
62:18 - don't even need to download a code if
62:19 - you just want to do this off platform
62:21 - all you do is open the circuit PI all
62:24 - caps open that drive and inside you'll
62:28 - see a code a PI file a Python file and
62:32 - any time you make a changes and save it
62:34 - it will actually start the board it will
62:35 - just keep it constantly run the board so
62:38 - let's see there we go there's our random
62:42 - random color every half-second is it's
62:49 - kind of cool that's right okay yeah so
62:57 - this actually kind of art might be a
62:59 - little bit hard understand yes
63:00 - remembering inside the fill function
63:01 - there are actually two three three
63:05 - different numbers like a tuple just
63:08 - formatted code so it's like you have the
63:11 - first one right here mm-hmm second one
63:14 - right there that third one right there
63:16 - and they're each so we're basically
63:20 - randomizing each RGB of each value yeah
63:23 - so our value the G value each each one
63:26 - of these is a random number random
63:27 - integer between 0 and 255 ok cool
63:34 - anything else dummy I think that's it
63:37 - cool yeah so life Sonny was saying we've
63:40 - got this promotion today only if you
63:44 - subscribe to pro and you fill out a form
63:49 - and I'll post the form in a second on in
63:52 - the chat but we will ship you what are
63:55 - we gonna ship we're going to ship the
63:56 - harsher itself to your door if you yeah
63:59 - Pro annual but go check your email good

64:33 - and we'll see you see you later yeah all
64:38 - right
64:38 - I

Cleaned transcript:

cool all right and we are live hello everybody my name is sunny and I am a curriculum developer here at code Academy and before this I taught CS in the classroom and for the last year and a half I worked on ton of courses extremely proud of including sequel content using datasets from Warby Parker twitch the met hacker news some ml content such as the handwriting recognition and the street easy multiple linear regression lessons some C++ content such as the Harry Potter sorting hat quiz that super psyched about but the course that is dropping today might be my new favorite thing on code Academy before we get it sorted though let's spam and chat where is everybody from where are you from and also if you're feeling it let's add a fun fact about yourself what's a fungi about me my favorite food is barbeque eel there's an error arlynn from India hello Jean from France New Zealand from the United Kingdom Pennsylvania Netherlands Blair's for you Georgia London hello Kelly hello Gregory hello David hello Mary Joe hello spots night from Chicago so how many people are we at right now 110 cool as we're waiting for people to jump in the stream let's go over some the cool stuff that were released over the last few weeks we released log code on April Fool's Day so my buddy Josh is a frontend engineer on the grill team and I cowrote this chorus for April Fool's on Wako this esoteric programming language that's inspired by internet memes and cats so right now it is a easter egg course meaning it's not part of the catalogue you have to have the URL so go google you know code CAD me learn law code and you'll find it so please go take that our suite plus plus community challenge also wrapped up also concluded it lasted the whole month of March we Eric from Cali and snun from Turkey have teamed up and made a super beautiful recipe terminal app and they both got a cook yummy hoodie and I'll do we know who no deliver to their doors another course shops include learn R which is a programming language and software environment that is used for statistical computing and research and we also released learn C sharp this is super awesome a widely used language a generalpurpose language also focus not o P released by Microsoft so go check that out cool hello you serve Anthony from San Francisco Jennifer Charleston South Carolina hello Toronto Toronto Sudan greetings from Pennsylvania fun fact my cats are featured in our vlog course yes and also my two my cat babies pypy alfafa are internet memes our memes are course like still can't believe it anyways you're not here for those courses so today I'm super super super stoked to announce that we're finally releasing our first ever hardware course so whether interested in electronics wearables robotics IOT whatever this is the course for you this is something I really wanted when I was a student in college and I'm super happy that we actually got this out and for this course we actually teamed up with Adafruit we're not even start with Adafruit so when I was in undergrad I well wrapped around underground I actually joined the startup in Columbus Ohio called neo kinetics and this is this story actually didn't even tell the more in PT so shout out to them and we had to deliver this MVP it was basically for Assaf engineers with two cofounders and we basically had to deliver this MVP that was essentially a motion sensor exercise game for patients with parkinson's disease for the columbus hospital and as we're like you know research as I was researching for like what's text at what tech do we use we landed on csharp and the Microsoft Kinect okay and I kind of like fell into a rabbit hole weird setting you know do we use SDK one or SDK two so they are you tubing no worries just the same stayed stay in the stream you don't need to know too much for this stream but anyways as where I was researching Microsoft Kinect I came up the found this company called Adafruit right and at the time when I was undergrad you at least I did all I mostly only hear about due√±os and raspberry PI's so when I was researching about Microsoft Kinect which was this super stateoftheart a vast relatively lowcost motion sensor that was originally developed for to be at gaming accessory for the Xbox 360 and my X Box 1 so we're did we know we're looking at the SDKs for that choosing deciding on which one we found out that the reason why Microsoft even released the opensource the sort of software development kit for Microsoft Kinect is because native through back in 2012 Ashley did a hackathon open source hackathon where they basically did a bounty so any so they released this sort of hackathon for $3,000 and four of the whole world if you're able to hack the Microsoft Kinect you'll get this money prize so that's when I decided that's when I was like oh wow there's some companies super special on there like pushing that boundaries of opensource and Microsoft eventually actually did release SDKs as well as you know it's cool now to see like how its Microsoft Kinect it's actually integrated with their cloud platform so it's really cool to see like a you know a hardware company have such a big impact in the whole tech industry so this is definitely dream come true we actually cover this course with Lamar and 2pt as well as many other team members on Adafruit it's definitely a dream come true cool so can we use a tofu fried we know so a tofu is actually a company that sells I guess they also sells oh dude we knows but a tofu release a language called circuit Python which is what we're gonna work on today and you can actually program Adafruit devices in the hell do you know platform that I'll do we know IDE which is just calling it out there you know so this story you know hopefully I don't think L'Amour and Petey are watching right now but I'm probably gonna share with them to see like oh wow like so much has happened in the last four or five years you know so many things come around and we're working together with my you know my heroes I guess cool so today to celebrate the course we're also running a promo so if you subscribe to a pro annual subscription you'll actually receive a circuit playground Express today only so go check that out go check your email so which coding language are we using hello Elijah so we're using a language called circuit Python so let me scroll down real quick so today I'm going to demo some of the content in this course as well as a project so circuit python essentially expire on plus optimized for hardware it's a branch it's a fork a derivative of micro Python it's a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to program on hardware devices it makes getting started with low cost microcontroller boards easier than ever before so the goal here is to actually build the best introductory chorus into Hardware programming because to be honest there's only two type people that meet people who absolutely coders who absolutely love hardware programming and also people who either haven't started or are intimidated by Hardware programming so if you have some Python knowledge this should be super easy for you if you have no experience no worries it's actually really easy to get started and this course will start with learning how to line up colors with circuit playground Express using buttons and there are three different projects in this course biplane plant care as a sort of automated plant system where you measure the temperature the moisture level the the light value as well as the 88 drum machine okay so these are super super cool projects okay so before we go into more depth let's actually let's just get started okay I'm gonna show you a quick runthrough of maybe like the beginning of the course this is actually is a pro exclusive course so what is circuit Python so this little video yeah wouldn't you skip this let's just a few seconds a few seconds we know we boom we hit you with a video and this is a little more by the way she is almost like the face of the DIY hardware space definitely leading figure even when I was in college everybody looked up to her so next we have the setting up by the way this right here is a circuit play rock express this little circuit board right here okay it's $25 it has memory it has licensors life sensor temperature sensor motion sensor aceleration sensor a double tap sensor it can play sound it can play audio files it can play basic tones if you tell it the frequencies and the duration you want to get the tone it has buttons so you actually supposed to beat this way okay back in so I'm gonna hold this upside down has two buttons button a button B has a slight switch right here a reset button it has cap touches along the edges seven of them which is basically like that you know it detects human touch it has neopixels which are these sort of revolutionary very stateoftheart LED lights where you can literally give it the RGB value red green blue values and we'll just play any colors you want super cool so circuit pytho hey hello Katie great question so circuit python is a programming language to be followed by Adafruit and circuit playground Express is the the circuit board the board this little circular device and Adafruit is a company that developed both of them please you know feel free to add some questions so he's it easier to learn Python after learning circuit Python great question so actually suggests if the perfect way is actually learned some basic Python so I'll say learn printing learn if statements and loops and then getting to circuit Python but because we want to make this course the best reductive course to hardware there there is actually no prerequisites for this course right because circuit python is essentially Python and place some more stuff cool so setting up so here are some items in the course where you test your USB download the circuit python from this file it's already downloaded and I plugged it in to my computer right here through a USB and after we played it in there should be something called a circuit PI Drive the volume or disk drive whatever you want to call it appear on your desktop right here it's all caps circuit PI an inside circuit PI there's two files well when you first actually load in the circuit python you start so you'll only one file the boot underscore file.txt a text file and inside it there is just basically some meta information about the version of the circuit python that you have not too important but the next file next to it the code a PI a Python file is the most important file so the code opcode PI actually controls the circuit playground Express okay so anytime you save it the board actually restarts it keeps running this file over and over again okay so in this course we're gonna basically update the code inside this file so that we change whatever this does so Anju Larsen if we sign up a pro annual membership today what was being thrown in so you if you sign up for pro Nia subscription today subscription today prescription I'm not sure what this is Ashley what you'll get in the door to an extra circuit playground Express mailed to your door okay cool so let's get started to show you a little preview of the course here we have a brief intro circuit playground Express is a perfect introduction to electronics and programming it has a built in USB support meaning you can plug into programming then the program just shows up no special cable or adapter adapter required just program your code into copi on this board and take you on the go and here in this course we're used circuit Python okay all right could this work as a Raspberry Pi hmm it's a great question so Raspberry Pi is essentially a mini computer whereas it has its own operating system right whereas this right here it's actually not a computer this is purely a circuit board okay which way is easier to get started I would say probably this right here and then you learn Raspberry Pi or do we know okay the reason why this was made was because we're trying to make it as easy as possible so what the learning difficulty of learning curves I always have with power programming is learning about the tech specs okay learning about all the different parts that's on each circuit board so right here we actually made a super super cool visualization shout out to Nick that's another CDF here who actually inspired me to go check on learn to Co a great course essentially you can hover over different parts of the bore and learn about the different parts right here we have an on button a green LED indicates that circuit breaker is powered right here this is upside down by the way okay here's a real red LED here are oh I'm sorry whoops oh sorry about that everybody so right here green on LED indicates the circuit pretty brown Express is powered on here is the d13 the red LED use for basic blinking this is usually sometimes used for the holo version of the hardware version of hello world right we get into blink to test it to debug it here are the neopixels along the edges here we have a push button be a push button a a reset button speaker cap touches along the edges cool there's actually two ways to to output sound one is through this little builtin mini speaker and the other way is actually you connect the a zero cap touch the a zero sorry the pin to a real speaker so you don't want you know you annoy your neighbors with it okay so after you learn all the different cool parts that come with this little board we get into our first programmable exercise so we'll learn about neopixels how to make these lights up here okay so neopixels are a revolution revolutionary and ultra popular way to add lights and color to your project these full color RGB lights red green blue lights at the controller inside the LED so you can just push the RGB RGB data to your device and LEDs will do all the work for you so they're programmable and circuit playback Express has ten of these okay so ten different lights inside each neo neo pixel there are actually three LEDs the are the G and blue and each LED is controllable by the circuit next to it which acts like a brain so to do this with code we actually first have to import the Adafruit underscore circuit playground I expressed library import the CPX which stands for is circuit play guy express GPX cool and all the neopixels can be lit to the same color specified using the CP X pixels dot fill function ok here's a function with the Perthes set of parentheses and the color that we want will go inside this parentheses right here so it should give you an example red is actually to 5500 okay are sorry rgb2 5500 and 0 means fully off 255 is fully on right so there's 19 to 50 2056 numbers so if we want to make all this colors of the circuit board Express circuit playground Express red we all we need to do is do this function here CPX top pixels fill parentheses inside inside this parentheses is actually a tuple of the RGB values so notice there's actually two sets of parentheses a little tuple RGB value that's been closed by the parentheses right here cool and to turn all the neopixels red forever you actually need an infinite while loop they repeatedly execute the code inside over and over again right while true the code inside is executed once Wow true yes it is true I see you again again again it's just basically an infinite wild cool so Gregory what would this course practically prepare me for so that's actually a great point so if you're into for something I almost always believe in is you know people always say is practice practice practice is sometimes practice can get you know you'll burn out right you know sometimes when I use a lot of other other platforms we're just you know Joe Joe you with you know a bunch of code challenges over and over again you definitely start to get a little bit bored and sometimes what I like to do when I'm learning to code is try to use the same language for different things so Python for example you can build a terminal program you can do machine learning NLP which ii learned you could with ltk with NLP you can do pandas for data manipulation data retrieval you can visualize data with matplotlib and these are all Python right you can build a web basically like a web developer with python with django and flask and you can do this right here which is robotics hardware wearables electronics circuit python so I usually try to use the same language in different light I tackle it from different angles so that I'll always be building interesting stuff and not burn out bored oh and this is what death will make if you do this you'll definitely become a stronger programmer okay so let's try this out in this exercise we're gonna light up the circuit playground Express first thing first let's import a module we already did let's click run very nice turn green so to light it up forever we'll need a while loop that will never end so let's add a while loop while true remember in Python in tation is very important unlike a lot of the other languages so I've added two spaces right here one two and inside the while loop let's pick a color so span and chat let's do a color first one give me a color everybody any color come on chat cool let's do that how do you pronounce this word cyan cyan cool cyan RGB ok so 0 255 255 right here very cool so while true let's add that in we're gonna use the CPS stuff pixels dot fill inside I remember we to do a 2tuple is this 0 255 255 I think so cool hit run it passes so now we actually want to move the code from the code Academy coeditor onto the circuit playground Express right so how do we do that the download button this time harm your computer keep oh whoops click the run boats down a long time keep okay we down it to add a level voter right here whoops let's to leave this one let's try one more time download keep whoops open and finder cool so this is the file we want we're gonna be dragged into code pi let's delete this one there's actually a easier way to do this I'm going to show you how later code pie cool save it cyan you can't not really see this in this I guess this is a green screen behind us that's why you can't see the little bit glitchy but all the colors appear it in cyan can you move a little to your left please yes sorry about that wait left or right this way cool awesome now that you've downloaded the code how long will it continue to run it will actually run forever until it runs out of memory a battery but because it's powered by the computer actually will never run out battery so if you actually do this with a if you actually add a tripple battery a triple a battery pack right here it will eventually run a battery but we're using energy it looks like a lightsaber eightzero cool alright everybody so now I give you a little quick demo there's a lot of more to this course let's do a project real quick okay we're not gonna get into the size switch the buttons amb let's just do a little well Rodney dependently up the computer if you have a battery pack yes so you can plug the USB the code will still be on the board you put a battery pack into it let's go play a battery pack and there we go cool alright let's go back let's show you a cool project that we can do so there are actually three different projects in this course a bike leg and we actually handpicked them cuz I usually like to have them sort of triangle you know the trio of projects at like cover different a wide variety of projects topics so the first one is by Clay SEC one is a plant automated system where you measure the temperature measure the moisture level measure the light value you plot it you pay said I see the the temperature variations during the day and the last one is a drum machine using fruits so today our from our Bach and Hannah buddies on Academy team basically told me to do the bike project okay so let's do this real quick it's actually the first project in this course before we get started let's to leave this works basically you actually don't see the code cool all right so the bike light project it's your first day as a hardware designer your first task is to create a customizable bike light for the guy from Brooklyn New York a delivery man that relies on his bike to get you started on your research your boss left a circuit playbacks press on your desk there's numerous inputs and neopixels for lights how fragile is this device it's actually pretty decent I've been carried in my pocket for least six months now dropped it multiple times still fine crit Zoe is in the chat cool create a customizable bike light for your client you will look at how you can define colors in code and use that to make some flying missions with neopixels what are you waiting for let's get started so here's a sigma disclaimer do not use at your soul by plane this is actually pretty strong but just in case you know you should have your to find them back not sure what's the New York law for this but more the better right cool so first things first listen for the module that we need so Adafruit underscore circuit playground Express there are actually two ways to program a circular bearings for us one is using this module this library with a bunch of functions in it the CPX functions but it's not great for a memory management force it's not great for the more lower level computing that you want to do so there's actually another set of functions that you can learn a little bit later about if you take this course so you have more control over the analog pins okay so circuit playground has 10 builtin neopixels the neopixels are number of clock counterclockwise from 0 to 9 for example to make the needle pixels read every base to do a live look so i actually skip this and when i did the lesson demo this is actually a later exercise but instead of using the CPX fail function you can actually specify individually each how each which color to give each of the the neopixels right so I'm still doing CP exfil blah the color for all to turn all of them to a single color Li do basically 10 of these index serie give it a red color index 1 you give it a blue color index 2 you have a orange color you know make a rainbow whatever you want okay so this code so this code right here we'll turn all the neopixels to red and this code right here specify only the neopixel index zero take off the outer parentheses so this co right here actually specify it to turn only one of them neopixel but in neopixel index 0 to red ok so two different functions a couple with it cool so there's two way to do this one is to do I'm gonna show you that the longer way to make all the colors into red remember I just showed you you can either do this to 5500 is right oh I am NOT a fan of these hotkeys are really small so basically you can do like two three four five to nine so right here I made if I you know let's do the circuit board Express I made six of the neopixel into red but if I want to make all of them read you can refactor your code to just be when I showed you in the lesson CPI stop pixels dot fill cool hit save download the code Oh we'll just keep this window of this code into the circuit board this go got pie and now the whole thing is red cool let's continue check this box check this box check the spot where you factored the code got it to the board red lights your pure very nice so the on and off switch the second phase so now you have something working you show your product manager the prototype this little scenario we can't blow more I came up with great work the lights are nice and bright but that will mean that the batteries were drained while the Bicas part the Quarrier is making deliveries can we add can we add an on and off switch this will conserve battery so it lasts all day so let the phase to begin before I move on to the part 2 anybody have any questions so we just got the whole neopixels all the neopixels to turn red cool no question so the circuit playground Express has a slight whistle I switch right here right underneath the the reset button inside the while loop so actually we can use a slide which to make an on and off button basically we can do slice which is the left will go read your side switch to the right it's it turns off okay so inside the while loop let's run it if same a conditional statement that turns all the neopixels red when CPX is on its left so wow it's true if CPX switch it's true so you can't even do this way or you can do it before you go to chew and we're gonna end this the code on line five to make it inside the if statement okay I'm gonna click Save next let's add an else statement that turns all the neopixels off so if CPS not switch it go to true would travel to the red else one we're gonna turn to off and how do you turn it off well you just do zero zero zero a tuple of three to put zeros safe is it possible hello gaming gamer is it possible to add external Assessors to it absolutely you can actually connect cap touches to fruits to other sensors yeah go check on the Adafruit comm to see a bunch of stuff that you can do with this with external sensors capacitive touch these things around on the other edge Marielle sunny may even cover some of that maybe ya public Zoe cap touch ya shout out to Marriott Zoe cool let's see if this worked so save download I almost want to show you how to do this the easy way but well move this into the circuit by volume or drive delete this cool loaded the code onto the board so let's see right now it's on let's turn the slide switch and now it's off on off slide switch on slice switch off very cool cool so you show this to your client part three you show this your client he loves it was but he asks is there any way I can make it blink so python has a time dot sleep function from the time of to use it you must first add this live code to the top import time actually you start doing him for Thomas to from time in course okay then to make the program holder sleep and this actually allows to use a sleep function which allows us to hold the program for an excellent number amount of seconds or sleep the program for X number of seconds how do you get the free hardware I'm not finding that when I go to the sign up page so you should get an email little cute girl you should get an email today this morning on the details how to do it yeah and Alex right here we'll put a link in the chat so you can sign up for this yeah let us know what you think let me know what you think now if you take the quiz cool so we added the sleep library and now let's change the code so that it turned the neopixels read sleep for fun 0.5 seconds and then we turn the neopixels off okay so let's do this when a slice which is to the left when I turn it on turn it red they're gonna sleep it beside the parenthese when it is 0.5 number of seconds and then I'm going to turn it off CPI stop pixels fill cool but yes let's test the blinking click download to download the code app I see let's download it I messed up I should have definitely showed this earlier how to change the setting of your download button delete it change it to code up I cool now we're good let's see sighs switch whoops just absolutely hit the reset button let's double click it you see this cool so something is a little weird is happening it's not holding for 0.5 seconds okay let's go down so why is it blinking like the way we wanted to blink off blink oh well let's walk through the code one more time so inside our code we actually turn the neopixels read slept it for 0.5 seconds and then we turn it off and the loop ends and we go back to the top again okay the wait after we turn the neopixels we never let it hold for sleep for sometime after we turn it off for the blink we actually never let a holder sleep for sometime and a while loop go back to the beginning and the neopixels turn read again that's where you see this weird not consistent blinking can you see this okay so this actually is super telling at stake and all it is is we add a sleep function after so so this is actually really interesting and this actually I didn't really you know connect the dots but when you're developing hardware when you're doing hardware design the code is actually a lot shorter right like the software part just with the software development part is actually a small part of it l'amour tell told us this when we met went over to the office and it's usually really hard to pinpoint we do software debugging compared to Hardware debugging it's actually a lot tougher to find that error right you got a zero this is a hardware problem this is a software problem they're actually two separate world of things that you got to check for and that's why we left a sort of a bug scenario scenario for you to exploit let's save it one more time download keep cool let's move it to circuit pipe delete this Giroud up high cool here we go on ah ah do you see how it's more consistent not like this faster on I like longer on and a shorter off it's a slight consistent on sleeper 0.25 second Oh a second very cool Bryant looters off Todd big but when you plan to add more advanced opposites ooh chocolate so I think we're working alright right now Zoey and Nick are two fellow C dubs I think soon next kill a month okay within the next couple of like before May I remember I saw the yeah we'll see called don't don't be afraid to jump back answer that or Zoey or Nick there we go Sonny's right we're cool sorry about that very cool so now you learn how to do this you can add more you can do a rainbow color you can do a faster blink if you press a or just slower blink if you press B so hopefully you know some of you will sign up for the course take this course work on the code a little bit and then send us your projects and if it's really cool will actually show this to the world by adding your project to the last step the last check point of this project very cool so in your fruit so code Academy XA tofu is finally happened wanted you know a hardware course on code kami years ago before I joined the team it's just been a crazy you know it's almost like the last year and have it's almost like dog years you go through CDs it's been a blur but super super happy to see this on our platform any questions any questions Hardware related whatever you later career related code can be related this is your time if you join this if you join the stream a little bit late if you sign up for a pro subscription today they in your plan you actually get the circumflex press in the mail for free kyun anytime anybody questions questions questions my name is it law so Ryan gamer my name on ticktock is blah your username on the tick tock app who will sit on the Iron Throne actually I actually didn't get to watch Game of Thrones last night because I was polishing this but tonight I'm definitely at lunch at first episode thank you thank you one vtec can you program with std what's SCD standard I'll do me no code STD not sure so yeah you can actually program this the circuit playground and the circuit player I express using out doing a ID not sure if that's a question so if I set up a pro what other extra things can I learn from the above free courses right so our pro course is currently our pro membership currently offer a variety of different courses learn Python 3 machine learning and every course will have projects and quizzes that you can happen to see for example icy pond supplies every single module every single lesson has three different products that accompanies it so that's like an easy project a middle project and a difficult project there's also a CLL community a slack channel where all the Poorna learners can help one other to grow to debug to to answer each other's questions to to be motivated what is the simplest programming code to start learning hello Carlos I seem to hop in a different one that's a never get far as I feel a bit overwhelmed interesting so this is actually a very common thing you're gonna feel as you know so Carlos are you a are you a are you selftaught programmer are you in going for a CS program or are you in a boot camp before I can answer this like before I can help you I need to learn a little bit more how does this compare to Raspberry Pi so this is actually not a minicomputer does it have like WiFi we connect connect to where as Raspberry Pi is basically its own little mini computer with this operating system for a hackathon actually at KU kami Marielle Zoe to my teammates here Ashley worked on a welcome bot for our code camis main interest for office basically when you go in we're still like trying to debug that right now but you know when you go in you can actually hear an mp3 file of suave our team members saying hello welcome to cope get me in the morning it's basically this sort of like a breath of air you know or like this sort of I guess it's like this prayer before you get on office sometimes like when do your unless you're not having a great day sometimes your own set you selftaught so Carl stop talk call so this is actually a very common thing especially when you're selftaught is protamine is basically like the CEO of information it's always expanding expanding and growing evolving right so to keep up is one thing but like to even get started learning is a completely different a very tough thing to do right it's like same thing as you learn when I say like same thing as you learn German or Japanese what I would do is try to program as much as possible it doesn't happy you know you gotta find your own personal learning style right like for some people it's like code a little bit every single day for me it's like I do these sprits where I just go ham and just wait I just like code nonstop for a week and then just rest for a little bit yeah it's an interesting thing I don't I think just tap try to you know emerge yourself with as much learning it's possible on different platforms on multiple different various different plans to figure out what your videos the best who frees you to code kami like this interactiveness and also meet people and actually another thing that I'll say is do this it's hard to get those small wins and those big wins in programming when you're doing it early on so you know build your own little program super early on and also try to find a team that some so actually we had a an on site sort of like a meetup event a week ago where actually somebody asked me that and asked me like what was my biggest win and my biggest win is probably when I made something real when I worked at neo kinetics where just for people like people here at Co kami actually hops more time on this a little earlier people like you think I've worked really hard at code kami but we didn't know it's before it go get me ice so pretty much so my soul you know teaching and even before that when I worked on neo kinetic steam for for three and a half months it was just I cut it I cut off social media that cut off it was just literally for 34 months nonstop working and that and I think I learned more in those 34 months that I've learned in my whole first two years of college outside and you you know you shut out to author who taught me who like mentored me and taught me a csharp taught me just you know there are definitely moments where it was definitely not struggle there or like we slept and then computer lab but now looking back I still got one more of those in me you know you know I stood it was just a really good time and I learned so much because I had this sort of mentor it was a little bit older than me and yeah so another question oh you're all gonna do other streams on this hardware at curriculum I'm not sure if depends on if people take this course who knows if you like it to you this will has snow give us feedback share our Twitter share on social media and if you like it we might do some others to cool stuff later Carlos for sure yeah just keep doing it if it's easy you'll be boring telling you I tell everybody list if it's easy it would be really boring you know the one reason why I got in tech is because there's your sniffing amount information to learn it's you slowly get into it and and I I really don't like that you know the phrase like fake it till you make it just just learn it if you don't know it just learn it don't ya that's not and it builds up everything you do builds up and that's another thing can I go freelance with Pro yes yes how fast so if it depends on what you want to do hello Katie this is a question from Katie freelance with Pro so depends on what you want to do for I think the low the lowest level entry for the tech industry is probably web developing did Alice this sort of entrylevel junior level positions and I'll say I've seen in CL community the SAC channel community like there are people who found a job after 10 8 8 to 10 months but with that you have to network you have to connect the people you got to have a thick skin and then thanks again right thick skin is for to reach out to people in this case like you have this level of trying to hit this level of quality okay army 95c spec I'm a sysadmin an infrastructure guy and have always been Durst and programming touch some of your free courses well this possibly be a good transition is that support hardware currently yeah absolutely I think this will be a great and super fun and like course to get into Python right circuit Python Python they hopefully will spark and this I always tell people this like everything build on code Academy are this points you can build a game you can build a webpage you can build a data visualization but it's all constrained by this sort of monitor and when you see your code come to life and hopefully you know it lights up this light up your inner fire similar to like you know when you open up a Lego box for Christmas when you're a kid and hopefully you're like okay this is actually not too bad this is actually super addictive super fly super magical please please share if you work on this course please share us like show us what school stuff you build they're actually so many different things they can build with this so alright everybody so this yeah so sunny you keep you keep answering questions so I'm I'm Alex I've never done any hardware stuff before but I was watching sunny stream and so I wanted to so I know Python a little bit and so I want to play around with the colors so you get the colors to change every time so it's Donny you keep answering questions okay I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna see see what what else we can write this so this is a kind of shame that I always that we personal yeah so keep asking questions I will I don't do this so it's telling my idea is that okay what's have a variable for red and then each time through this loop increase that variable by one mmhmm interesting so you basically set so the RGB value g/b value you set the art as like a bearable yeah increments like throw some green there call that's cool and then we'll also do do you want to explain what modulus um so you know we could so what so on line 14 oh and I'm like way in the way so live 14 you see a little percentage symbol if you haven't program in Python or some other generalpurpose prime modulus symbol it returns to remainder so it finds basically we're dividing read the variable by 255 and whatever is a remainder what is the leftover is returned okay so for modulo 245 to there's a remainder of 0 so it zeroes return 5 modulo 2 yeah so the idea here is that we're gonna start red at 0 every time through the loop red is going to increase by 1 so it's gonna get more and more and more red and then when red hits 256 it's gonna go back down to 0 so we're never gonna have anything more than 255 and the idea here is that you're signing show me how to show me how to do this yeah so if I download it yeah yeah we can show them the school yeah let's keep answering questions though call so you basically move whatever it's downloads yeah cool army 95 CSC spec there's so many options out there have not so many programming options and I've not picked a path on which language I want to dedicate my state up yeah so this is actually a very interesting thing I actually always tell me about just don't we always have this grand vision like hey I want to be you know I want to master this programming language I think just when you start out learn try out test out you know dabble in multiple different languages figure out their domain that you want to you know want to work in don't care about you know how much money you gonna make don't care about any of that what makes you enjoying like what makes you get you going what like makes you tick right whether it's game development whether it's making data visualization interactive data services is a 3d game developer it's a 2d game element do you want to do in unity or a VR or AR or do you want to do it for HTML based like a web browser browser based video game you know do you want to build a GUI app a desktop app do you want a bit build a mobile like figure these things these things out first and then you know dabble a little bit make sure that's the right one and just double down on that but before you double down on like a single language I would say just try out different different things you don't know what's your favorite what's your thing to try um let's see Emily said how is a deferred different from Arduino is it better Wow so so so so I'll do you know has been around for a while and Adafruit actually sells this again different words start to play toys for us I think we said a fruit from Emily yeah yeah so you know for even when I was undergrad there are basically two companies that are like the pillars of hardwood space do you know where as bait pie and if it became kind of like came around underneath and start gaining momentum but basically for me I'll do he knows they're razmik I were always like super difficult to like to get started on right and it's always intended like I remember you my web apps lab we've built door unlocking well Gino back the day there was no tutorials really online like two to five of these sort of how to get started and Adafruit came around selling raspberry pies manufacturing and Reno's and selling stocking different circuit boards and the reason why they came out with this is that they want to make the easiest the most easiest perfect way to get you to get started so they build its circuit board and they build they develop this program in which go circuit like that so it's basically a little easier and also a tofu's our neighbors they're eight blocks away also located in Soho yeah that's a good question yeah there's a ton of computer occupy definitely worse to open to what kind of support will be available when I'm attempting to learn this so so that's a question from a are you tubing like how to how to get help learning this I think one of the one of the things that we offer with the pro subscription is access to the CLL which is a slack community where people can post questions or talk to each other about what they're working on the sunny put on a the C++ what was it called a community challenge where people worked together so that's a good space that we're trying to make that where people can work together and help debug each other's projects things like that yeah and don't forget the forums to and Facebook as well nick says okay sunny so my idea was see if this works I don't know I don't know if the green screen is okay so we should actually I don't think that's working so I changed the code here too so this is kind of a good example of how this kind of hardware we can help teach Python where what I'm doing now is I took out the the blinking look at that blinking and so I'm just making this loop increase red by one each time and so as you as a result over time the color the color won't change where it starts where red is zero and then eventually red will get up to 255 cool and just to make this laser can we do yeah we can do that yeah so this code is basically doing this right here so let's just focus let's just zoom in on these three lines okay yeah and even even this line where we create red cool right so red starts at zero so when the program starts and again my face is in the way which is annoying red is zero green is 100 blue is zero and then as the program runs red increases and increases and increases which change the color over time yeah so I don't know I love this sort of hardware stuff because you know even if you've never coded before in Python this is a cool little example of how variables can be used right cool yeah should we try we should try make all we can do random let's do okay we're like a little bit over time one last little demo so we're gonna first I don't know how to get a random number in Python let's look it up that's just yeah but let's let's check and also I'm gonna like make us smaller because we were huge my face is constantly in the way of this keep answering questions sunny is do we also get a mentor great question Katie so so I'll say in the CIO community you should just always ask questions anytime you have a bug in under confused by any sort of topic and we also have something called code coaches you might just have to Google this cooked which is code Academy that and they're also like I think by our by half hour sessions where you can like we'll do a oneonone session video chat with a expert any domain how did I I thought code kami explanations were not that y'all got to leave code sunny how do you any sleep it's just sleep for sleep 0.5 yes bro what I already upload code to the adafruit so you basically download actually you don't even need to download a code if you just want to do this off platform all you do is open the circuit PI all caps open that drive and inside you'll see a code a PI file a Python file and any time you make a changes and save it it will actually start the board it will just keep it constantly run the board so let's see there we go there's our random random color every halfsecond is it's kind of cool that's right okay yeah so this actually kind of art might be a little bit hard understand yes remembering inside the fill function there are actually two three three different numbers like a tuple just formatted code so it's like you have the first one right here mmhmm second one right there that third one right there and they're each so we're basically randomizing each RGB of each value yeah so our value the G value each each one of these is a random number random integer between 0 and 255 ok cool anything else dummy I think that's it cool yeah so life Sonny was saying we've got this promotion today only if you subscribe to pro and you fill out a form and I'll post the form in a second on in the chat but we will ship you what are we gonna ship we're going to ship the harsher itself to your door if you yeah Pro annual but go check your email good and there Yelp there's a custom support help forum go through and I think we're only doing that for the first 200 people that that fill out that form I think so so yeah but this last last I checked there's still a lot more to go so go sign up now if you want to do it don't wait till midnight yeah huh cool cool good job sunny thank you everybody if you have questions please keep coming and we'll see you see you later yeah all right I
