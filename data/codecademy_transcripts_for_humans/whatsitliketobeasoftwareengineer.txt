00:01 - I'm Jack I'm a software engineer I work
00:05 - on the curriculum platform team well I
00:12 - was working as a like a junior web
00:15 - engineer at a very small ride-sharing
00:18 - start-up after coming from that I was
00:20 - looking to work on a larger team where I
00:22 - would have people around me that knew
00:24 - what they were doing and could kind of
00:27 - like educate me about what it means to
00:28 - be like just like a professional
00:31 - software engineer be prepared to be
00:34 - humbled you might be like kind of
00:36 - confident cuz you just finished it's
00:37 - like whatever learning program you did
00:38 - and you've acquired all this knowledge
00:41 - and now you're like excited ready to
00:44 - apply it you're gonna feel like wow I've
00:45 - acquired so much and they're gonna get
00:47 - there and they're gonna ask you to do
00:48 - something you're gonna be like oh my god
00:50 - I have no idea how to do this and I
00:52 - think a large part about being an
00:53 - engineer is realizing that that's what
00:56 - being an engineer is is over time you're
00:58 - going to acquire knowledge and know how
01:00 - to reproduce things but I think your
01:01 - biggest values in engineer is being able
01:04 - to like think creatively in new contexts
01:06 - and be able to use the tools that you do
01:08 - know to kind of build a new strategy
01:10 - that you didn't have before I don't even
01:14 - know how you view things it's not a
01:15 - computer scientist anymore but you might
01:16 - you might see things like oh this like
01:20 - operation they have going on here you
01:22 - can think about it as like a procedure
01:24 - of like making a coffee and selling the
01:26 - coffee you can think about modeling the
01:28 - coffee cup is like a class in Java and
01:30 - you can think of modeling the barista as
01:31 - a class and oh what's the relationship
01:34 - of baristas to coffee cups to customers
01:35 - and and you can start doing that with
01:37 - just about anything you experience in
01:39 - life and it's applicable then to various
01:42 - contexts because you can then do that
01:44 - you don't have to write a single line of
01:45 - code but then suddenly you're walking in
01:47 - and making a coffee shop more efficient
01:48 - because you were able to abstract the
01:50 - relationships that people perform and
01:52 - identify points of slowdown and
01:54 - communication breakdown
