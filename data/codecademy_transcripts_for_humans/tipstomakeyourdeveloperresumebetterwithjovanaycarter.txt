00:01 - go live
00:05 - cool
00:06 - so now we are definitely live hello
00:09 - everybody for those watching live and
00:11 - for those that will watch in the future
00:13 - uh
00:14 - we are in another episode of tips and
00:16 - tricks and recruiting
00:18 - and today we have the one and only
00:21 - giovanni you want to introduce yourself
00:23 - uh tell me a little bit about your
00:25 - background maybe
00:27 - sure uh my name is joveney carter um i'm
00:31 - an associate recruiter with ko academy
00:33 - and i've been with kocademy since
00:36 - uh september
00:38 - oh my anniversary just passed so
00:40 - september 7th last year so about a year
00:42 - now
00:43 - thank you and um
00:45 - i'm i recruit mostly for the curriculum
00:48 - roles right now which include
00:51 - um
00:52 - like a a a decent level of technical um
00:56 - abilities uh but i've also done some
01:00 - recruiting for
01:01 - uh people team like hr roles
01:04 - uh talent roles
01:06 - some a couple of other like product
01:08 - manager roles things like that um but
01:11 - right now i'm mostly in curriculum
01:13 - did you always knew that you wanted to
01:14 - be a recruiter was it like you know you
01:16 - were eight and you said you know mom i
01:17 - want to be a recruiter
01:20 - no no that's not how it works i didn't
01:22 - even really know that it was a career
01:24 - stage but um coming out of uh college i
01:29 - knew that i didn't want to get into
01:30 - consulting but i wanted to do something
01:32 - that had like stability and i had a
01:34 - friend
01:35 - that said oh you're you know a people
01:37 - person you'd be really good at this
01:39 - and i went into executive search
01:41 - um which is sort of like consulting but
01:43 - it's more uh people oriented and so i
01:46 - was like okay i like this
01:48 - um and then as i was in the executive
01:50 - search role i really enjoyed
01:53 - uh just like power structures and you
01:55 - know being able to be able to influence
01:57 - the people who are making decisions
01:59 - um and how it really can change the
02:02 - whole scope of a company so that's why
02:04 - i'm a career now
02:06 - okay yeah i mean i didn't know what
02:08 - community was either until somebody told
02:09 - me so it's one of those roles i think
02:11 - that it's not very clearly defined
02:14 - but then once you discover it's like oh
02:15 - this is actually really cool awesome
02:17 - great yeah i can do this yeah so now
02:19 - that you're focusing here on code
02:20 - academy you've been focusing you said
02:22 - mostly on
02:23 - hiring for curriculum team uh i would
02:26 - imagine that you come across a large
02:28 - spectrum of people from all kinds of
02:30 - backgrounds all kinds of expertise right
02:32 - like because being a curriculum
02:34 - developer is not very straightforward
02:36 - either i guess like um it's not like
02:38 - saying well i'm a mechanical engineer
02:39 - and i build engines like like that's a
02:41 - very kind of like stray arrow sort of
02:44 - knowledge i would imagine that for
02:46 - curriculum developers depending on the
02:47 - field what they do comes from all kinds
02:50 - of places so
02:51 - do you you know um one thing i wanted to
02:54 - ask you was
02:56 - how you see because a lot of learners in
02:59 - code academy
03:00 - also have this kind of diversity in
03:02 - background how do you see these kind of
03:04 - backgrounds playing in stem or like pros
03:07 - and cons when you are trying to apply
03:08 - for you know tech companies like getting
03:10 - to the technical field is that like
03:12 - is that something that you need to worry
03:14 - about is that pretty common spread you
03:16 - know that's a really good question i do
03:19 - see that all the time where learners or
03:22 - just people from various backgrounds are
03:24 - applying to roles and i think people
03:28 - from a lot of backgrounds will apply to
03:29 - curriculum roles especially because it
03:31 - is a
03:32 - it is a
03:34 - interdisciplinary role where you have to
03:37 - have the technical abilities and some
03:39 - technical experience to say well i've
03:41 - i've coded before i know what four stack
03:43 - is like i i could teach these things but
03:46 - then secondly you have to have some sort
03:47 - of teaching education experience um to
03:50 - be able to really demonstrate like
03:52 - strong pedagogy um and so because of
03:55 - those two fields sometimes i'll get
03:57 - people to always left left field all the
03:59 - way right field uh but uh there are very
04:03 - few times where there are people that
04:05 - are like straight up and down the middle
04:07 - um but we're not necessarily looking for
04:09 - someone that's up and down like has has
04:11 - somehow been a
04:13 - coding teacher all their life
04:16 - um
04:16 - we're really looking for people who just
04:18 - have been able to demonstrate experience
04:20 - in both
04:22 - fields so let's say that let's say that
04:24 - you were previously i actually had this
04:26 - this this um
04:28 - candidate once who was a pilot in their
04:31 - previous career
04:33 - uh yeah and um
04:36 - we ended up moving forward i think he
04:37 - was a part-time hire for a while but uh
04:40 - he was interviewing for a part-time role
04:42 - a part-time curriculum uh like
04:46 - front-end you know content creation role
04:48 - something like that and um
04:51 - he
04:52 - uh had actually
04:54 - he didn't do a boot camp or anything he
04:55 - had done
04:56 - like he had fully learned on co academy
04:59 - for like the past year and he had
05:01 - several projects to prove his
05:03 - expertise and so he had the projects to
05:05 - prove his expertise and um he had
05:08 - written blogs or something like that
05:11 - about his learning experience as he was
05:12 - going through that and so he sort of
05:14 - fulfilled the two main parts that we
05:16 - needed which was like his writing
05:18 - experience being able to teach other
05:19 - people but also his technical experience
05:22 - um so it's not that you have to have
05:24 - five year career in this it just has you
05:27 - you just really need to demonstrate um
05:29 - both now that was a part-time role and
05:31 - you know different roles at different
05:32 - levels like if you're going for a uh
05:35 - like a mid-level role you're gonna have
05:37 - have to have of course like three to
05:38 - five years of experience something more
05:40 - but that's just an example of like it
05:42 - doesn't need to be one solid background
05:45 - i feel like there's a lot to impact
05:46 - there um you mentioned you know having
05:48 - projects to demonstrate your knowledge
05:50 - uh blogging where you're trying to kind
05:52 - of like be out there and be proactive
05:54 - with showcasing your work
05:56 - uh you mentioned that he was self-taught
05:59 - showing that drive on like you know i'm
06:01 - gonna go through walls and and learn
06:03 - what i need to learn to land a job also
06:05 - knowing the platform that he was
06:06 - applying for like i want to get a job at
06:08 - code academy and i'm like very familiar
06:10 - with how good academy works the learning
06:12 - environment the course work everything
06:14 - so like there's a lot of them back i
06:16 - think there's there was a lot of things
06:17 - going for him
06:18 - and i know that uh my conversations with
06:21 - other recruiters they've touched on
06:23 - those things too where they will say
06:24 - well you need to research where you're
06:26 - going to apply for you know know where
06:28 - why you are applying for that company in
06:30 - particular
06:31 - so when you are in that phone interview
06:33 - and that's screening it's like you know
06:34 - what to say uh you know demonstrate that
06:37 - you know what you say you know on paper
06:39 - and the work on projects portfolios
06:41 - connect with people right so
06:44 - i feel like
06:46 - they take away basically is
06:49 - don't worry too much about what you
06:51 - perceive as being your background or
06:52 - like where you think that you stand and
06:54 - just worry more about what they're
06:56 - looking for right because i mean i think
06:58 - all the recruiters have mentioned this
06:59 - in the past that's like
07:00 - companies when they're recruiting
07:02 - they basically have like an idea of the
07:04 - candidate they're looking for so the
07:06 - company is going out there looking for
07:08 - that person which means that you
07:10 - basically has the applicant need to make
07:12 - sure that you fit into that mold
07:15 - basically is that is that right
07:17 - uh more or less yeah i i think
07:20 - i think you you just have to convince
07:23 - the recruiter or the hiring team
07:25 - that either you fit into that mode or
07:28 - that they can extend their mode to fit
07:30 - you
07:31 - um and and that doesn't have to be
07:34 - uh i think there are some extremes of
07:36 - that where people who may have like no
07:39 - experience in the specific field that
07:41 - they're interested are applying to like
07:43 - let's say they're uh they have
07:46 - a
07:47 - full stack experience but they don't
07:49 - have a lot of experience with mobile
07:50 - development um then and they haven't
07:53 - really developed ios apps it's gonna be
07:55 - much harder to convince the hiring team
07:57 - that you're going to be able to you know
07:59 - contribute early and often
08:01 - for a mobile development role if you
08:04 - actually haven't developed at all in ios
08:08 - and so the best thing you could do is
08:10 - put together a couple of projects and
08:12 - then go apply for that role if that's
08:13 - something that you really want um i
08:16 - think i think you're absolutely right
08:18 - like being prepared for the roles that
08:20 - you're applying to and being
08:22 - um intentional about the roles that
08:24 - you're applying to and not just being
08:25 - like i could fit this i can do this
08:27 - because
08:28 - uh if you if you like don't really have
08:30 - that that's a real thing right technical
08:32 - feel yeah i mean well people do that all
08:34 - the time but i feel like i feel like
08:37 - i've heard it before like they're saying
08:38 - well this person is kind of like a tr a
08:40 - jack of all trades but that's not what
08:42 - we're looking for like yeah good for you
08:43 - that you know a lot of things
08:45 - but we are only looking for this role to
08:47 - fail with this particular skill set and
08:50 - i've heard before that the the idea that
08:52 - some candidates it's not there's nothing
08:54 - really wrong with with well how they
08:57 - approach what they know it's just that
08:59 - you you don't really
09:01 - you don't necessarily care about the
09:04 - things that don't apply for the role in
09:05 - particular right so so
09:08 - sometimes there's that kind of like um
09:10 - it's almost country intuitive which is
09:12 - like you know too much or like you don't
09:13 - seem to be focused enough like we are
09:15 - hiring somebody to be a curriculum
09:17 - developer it seems that you could be
09:18 - also an engineer how do we know that you
09:20 - want to be a curriculum developer right
09:22 - you don't want to be an engineer right
09:24 - right you have to somehow demonstrate in
09:26 - your experiences or in your cover letter
09:30 - or something that this is actually what
09:32 - you want and not just you're just
09:34 - throwing your resume out there to
09:36 - anything because a lot of people do that
09:37 - too
09:39 - okay yeah yeah i think uh i mean there's
09:41 - always a worry about overfitting like oh
09:43 - you're too perfect molded into this but
09:46 - then i'm assuming that there's also a
09:47 - part where it's like this candidate is
09:49 - not focused enough it's like not not
09:51 - like concentrated enough
09:53 - so we i can't make a call if this person
09:54 - is going to be with us in six months
09:56 - because maybe for them this is just kind
09:58 - of like a stepping stone to some some
09:59 - other place right
10:01 - um and obviously for a company
10:03 - you want to hire somebody who's going to
10:04 - help the team which means that you know
10:06 - you can't just like keep a revolving
10:09 - door sort of so to speak i guess so
10:11 - speaking of concentrating and speaking
10:14 - of showcasing that work
10:15 - i'm assuming that you go through a lot
10:17 - of resonance
10:18 - like your fair bit of reading through
10:20 - resumes yeah i have a few questions
10:23 - about restaurants and i think the
10:25 - learners that are going to be watching
10:26 - this video live or later are probably
10:28 - having the same questions
10:29 - one of my questions is
10:31 - when you write a resume
10:33 - does it always have to be one page
10:38 - you'd be surprised how many people
10:40 - submit several page resumes okay um
10:44 - uh at co academy we don't automatically
10:49 - reject someone because of something
10:52 - what we being trivial to be like the
10:54 - length of their resume or the layout of
10:56 - their resume things like that um so we
10:59 - are try we try to be as um compassionate
11:02 - about that as possible at other camp
11:04 - companies i don't know what they do they
11:06 - probably
11:07 - if you have a multiple page resume they
11:09 - may not look at it it's not necessarily
11:11 - that it's not it's not um it's a volume
11:15 - thing right it's like you got 10 cents
11:16 - yeah it's like are they gonna get you up
11:17 - about seven seconds do you think they're
11:19 - gonna read that second page do you think
11:21 - they're gonna read the third page no
11:23 - um i know i know people also say that
11:26 - you know it depends on the years of
11:27 - experience like i get a lot of phd
11:29 - candidates and they submit their cvs
11:32 - that's a very different style of uh
11:35 - background um and i recognize that when
11:38 - i see their can their resume and i'm
11:39 - like okay well this is fcv this is all
11:41 - their articles published and it's
11:42 - actually relevant but if you've like
11:44 - been a software engineer at the same
11:46 - company for the past seven years you
11:48 - don't necessarily need three pages to
11:51 - demonstrate your work
11:53 - i know that i think it was harlan that
11:55 - mentions like look i'm looking up to
11:56 - them right that's how we read
11:58 - if i don't see anything that interests
12:00 - me that sparks my curious like oh this
12:01 - could be a good candidate
12:02 - that's it that's the end of the line
12:04 - like you just need to make sure that
12:06 - there's something and he said you know i
12:07 - don't mind spending some extra time and
12:09 - i can't that i'm pulling up the linkedin
12:10 - or something but but something has to
12:12 - spark the first
12:14 - interest yeah right yeah so
12:17 - i know that uh some learners especially
12:19 - now in 2021 with you know after the
12:21 - pandemic last year there was so much
12:22 - emphasis on being online and your
12:24 - wrestlemans traditionally are a very
12:26 - like paper so like even now right we
12:28 - write it as a document
12:29 - um platforms like linkedin have tried to
12:32 - virtualize or digitize a resume where
12:34 - it's a bit more like a website
12:35 - um
12:36 - how do you see the role of like
12:39 - resumes traditional resumes versus
12:42 - putting your content out there in places
12:44 - like linkedin is that is do they
12:45 - complement each other can they replace
12:47 - each other like is is the resume still
12:49 - like a very strong part of applying for
12:52 - any tech role that you've seen
12:55 - i think they complement each other but
12:57 - they serve different purposes
12:59 - uh
13:00 - like if you're applying to a job you may
13:02 - submit your linkedin profile but what
13:05 - i'm gonna see first is your resume uh
13:07 - versus if i'm sourcing people so if i'm
13:10 - looking on linkedin for people to fill a
13:12 - certain role the first thing i'm gonna
13:13 - see is your linkedin and then later i
13:15 - might ask you for your resume so i think
13:17 - that they support one another but they
13:20 - don't necessarily replace each other i
13:22 - think they do different things one is
13:23 - digital one is very like pointed
13:26 - um well they're both sort of digital one
13:28 - is like a website and one is very
13:29 - pointed to what you what your interests
13:32 - are or it should be uh like a lot of
13:34 - people in their current jobs won't
13:36 - display on their linkedin exactly what
13:38 - they're looking for because their
13:39 - employers see their linkedin um but on
13:42 - their resume they might say i'm actually
13:44 - looking for pivot careers i'm looking
13:46 - into this and so that that piece of the
13:48 - puzzle is
13:50 - is important
13:52 - oh that's interesting so there's a part
13:54 - um i'm thinking about resumes and the
13:56 - structure of it um you're saying that in
13:59 - some resumes people write like a bit of
14:00 - uh objective or gold or like a section
14:04 - like so so you think that that's helpful
14:05 - like people that are thinking of
14:07 - applying for jobs having like uh maybe
14:09 - what like two lines like how how does
14:11 - this actually structure
14:13 - i think it's super helpful to have like
14:15 - an intro like some sort of because what
14:18 - you really have to do right in the
14:19 - resume you have to guide the readers
14:21 - attention to where you want it to be and
14:24 - almost guide their perspective to what
14:26 - you want them to see and so if you write
14:27 - an objective and it says hi i am a full
14:31 - stack engineer looking for roles in
14:34 - this team like that automatically puts
14:36 - me in the space of okay so this
14:38 - experience should be like this or if
14:40 - their experience isn't this then i know
14:43 - from their objective that they're
14:44 - interested in this versus if they submit
14:46 - their resume and it doesn't match the
14:48 - experience that we're looking for and
14:49 - they don't have any sort of cover letter
14:51 - or objective census that says i'm
14:53 - looking for this sort of role then i'm
14:55 - just like well this person isn't a fit
14:57 - because they don't have the experience
14:58 - and they haven't communicated that
15:00 - they're looking for that you don't have
15:02 - a conversation with every applicant we
15:04 - only see their resume or their linkedin
15:06 - so you have to somehow communicate
15:08 - um what you want especially if your
15:10 - background isn't 100 a fit
15:13 - because i know that uh curriculum i mean
15:15 - not the curriculum sorry uh the cb or
15:17 - the resume uh i was thinking cv um i
15:21 - know that the real state is limited like
15:25 - you're trying to fit it in one page i've
15:26 - seen people you know really small font
15:28 - not enough spacing they're just trying
15:30 - to cram it all in that one pager so to
15:33 - tell somebody hey by the way besides
15:35 - your relevant experience and your
15:37 - education section and your skill section
15:38 - and maybe your hobbies section
15:40 - throw in there like a couple lines for
15:42 - an objective or a goal like passion or
15:44 - like while you're applying for this and
15:46 - some people might be like really do i
15:48 - really need to like i can't so
15:50 - if but it sounds to me like it's
15:52 - actually
15:53 - important like it can actually make a
15:55 - difference it can't make a difference
15:58 - it's but and i say especially for those
16:00 - who don't have the 100 experience or
16:03 - their experience is hard to navigate
16:05 - uh like you they know their experience
16:07 - and they know their journey but you
16:08 - can't necessarily understand how they
16:10 - went from being a pilot to being a a
16:14 - software developer um and you need you
16:16 - need a sentence to say hey i transition
16:18 - careers and this is what i'm passionate
16:20 - about um uh but i will say most people
16:24 - add too much information on their resume
16:26 - anyway and so probably people who are
16:29 - trying to squeeze the senses in and
16:30 - can't find space they can probably cut
16:32 - out several things that aren't necessary
16:36 - or that we won't look at like sometimes
16:38 - people will have seven bullets under one
16:41 - job and it's like no one's gonna read
16:43 - all that you have seven seconds to
16:45 - communicate your value and we're not
16:47 - gonna be reading all seven bullets under
16:49 - five jobs
16:51 - wait i'm curious now okay okay so let's
16:53 - let's just from jump right into that
16:56 - start telling me about all the horror
16:57 - stories of resumes because i'm sure that
16:58 - there's some lessons learned here
17:00 - i'm sure that this people watching this
17:02 - video now or in the future i'm sure that
17:04 - they can save themselves some pain
17:06 - uh with whatever you know what you've
17:08 - seen what are some of the common
17:10 - mistakes that people make like you just
17:11 - mentioned bullet points okay so if i'm
17:13 - writing my experience and i say you know
17:15 - 2016 to 2019 this job and i write
17:21 - seven eight lines explaining everything
17:23 - i was managing a team of seven or eight
17:24 - reporting to whatever i did this we
17:26 - achieved this goal and we did this one
17:27 - project
17:29 - sounds like that's too much
17:31 - how
17:32 - and what is that
17:34 - i think it falls back does it does it go
17:36 - back to the idea of like what you're
17:38 - trying to communicate what is it that
17:39 - you're trying to tell the recruiter
17:41 - what's the story i guess like is that so
17:44 - is that one of the typical things that
17:45 - you see maybe too much information you
17:46 - said yeah i see i see it all the time
17:49 - too much information i think people
17:51 - confuse
17:53 - uh the section of details on their
17:55 - resume with job description and it's
17:57 - actually not your job description it is
18:00 - your
18:01 - results your accomplishments your
18:02 - achievements um what you're actually
18:05 - like proud of um it's as if you're in
18:09 - you know you are having an elevator
18:10 - pitch and you have two sentences to
18:12 - communicate what you did and how it was
18:14 - great at that job like i think people
18:16 - should phrase it in their heads in that
18:19 - way as opposed to let me write every
18:21 - possible thing just in case this one
18:22 - thing or this one thing catches their
18:24 - eye
18:25 - another thing
18:26 - another way that people go wrong is that
18:28 - um people don't realize how
18:31 - um
18:32 - how complicated they sound on their
18:34 - resume when it's actually it shouldn't
18:36 - be that complicated uh for instance
18:40 - you know
18:41 - uh if i wrote you know
18:44 - well let me not give a specific outfit
18:45 - but
18:46 - sometimes people give too much detail
18:48 - about what they're actually doing when
18:51 - the reader doesn't know their company or
18:53 - doesn't know their
18:55 - actual uh
18:56 - business set up so if
18:59 - if you know if i talk about the specific
19:02 - uh curriculum people that i'm hiring
19:05 - that might be important but if i talk
19:07 - about um
19:09 - you know this person and that part like
19:11 - it's just somehow somewhere you have to
19:13 - find a line between
19:15 - uh the overview and the weeds of your
19:18 - description and you really only need to
19:19 - give an overview you don't need to go
19:22 - into deep description because if the
19:23 - overview doesn't catch their attention
19:25 - then the description won't either and
19:27 - it'll just be a waste of space
19:29 - i feel like um so is it fair to say um
19:32 - i feel like resumes is sort of like the
19:33 - first thing that you're gonna see but
19:35 - like i said before if that interests you
19:38 - as a recruiter then you might set up a
19:39 - phone interview right to learn more
19:41 - about them so like i feel like some
19:43 - people so am i correct in inter in
19:45 - understanding that your resume should
19:47 - showcase some of that work enough that
19:50 - it makes the other person interested the
19:51 - person reading it and then they can
19:53 - always call you they can always hang by
19:54 - your phone and then you can explain at
19:55 - length like what you did hey i saw that
19:57 - you have this
19:58 - relevant experience can you talk you
20:00 - know can you tell me more about this
20:02 - role or how you did this right like
20:04 - you're trying i feel like some people
20:05 - write their resumes as they are trying
20:07 - to answer questions in a phone screen
20:09 - interview
20:10 - is that is that what's happening
20:12 - yeah well not necessarily they just try
20:15 - to put as much detail as possible to
20:18 - just cover all bases they're like oh
20:20 - well just in case you want to know about
20:22 - this project i also did this and it does
20:24 - this cool thing and it's relevant to
20:26 - this company this way when that's
20:27 - actually not
20:28 - important we want to know the high level
20:31 - overview and why it was awesome if you
20:33 - could say i was amazing and two to three
20:36 - bullet points that's good um you don't
20:38 - necessarily need more for that um now if
20:41 - you had a job at a company for 10 years
20:43 - and you did a lot of amazing stuff then
20:46 - that's a different story than if you
20:48 - were at a company for two years and you
20:51 - did some amazing stuff but like you did
20:53 - some really amazing stuff we want to
20:55 - know the really great stuff the stuff
20:57 - that you let the stuff that you produce
20:59 - um and that's what that's what gets
21:02 - attention not okay the my new details
21:06 - what about what about the skills section
21:07 - of resume is that a mistake when people
21:09 - write skills teamwork microsoft office
21:13 - uh communication um
21:20 - i mean i'm not saying that it let's not
21:21 - say it's a mistake but um i mean what's
21:23 - the value of that section like if if
21:25 - somebody were to remove it like
21:27 - that's not a section is that a negative
21:29 - against the resume then
21:32 - i think you need the skill section but i
21:34 - do not think that you need to list
21:36 - every skill set you've ever learned in
21:38 - your life i think you need to list the
21:40 - skills that are important for the role
21:42 - that you're applying to so if you're
21:43 - applying for
21:45 - a curriculum role for instance um you
21:47 - need to demonstrate that you have that
21:49 - full stack experience but also that you
21:51 - have
21:52 - teaching experience so you might say
21:54 - both of those things in your skill sets
21:56 - now if you're applying to a marketing
21:59 - role or pr role maybe saying
22:01 - communication could be important but um
22:04 - you know it may not be the most
22:06 - important detail to add on a technical
22:08 - role when we want to know more about
22:10 - which technical skill sets that you have
22:13 - okay and do you know anything about uh i
22:15 - know that some companies do some sort of
22:16 - like pre-scanning resumes where they're
22:18 - looking for keywords or things like that
22:19 - and i've heard in the past that maybe at
22:22 - the bottom of your resume like you know
22:23 - at the very last line of or something or
22:25 - even even in the margin
22:27 - um
22:28 - add keywords or hashtags or like certain
22:30 - things that will kind of like a computer
22:32 - will pick up that human might not see
22:34 - that's why they say put out at the end
22:36 - um
22:37 - is that in your experience i don't know
22:38 - if your kodakami or another place is
22:40 - that a thing that some people can take
22:41 - advantage of trying to hit more keywords
22:44 - so they get sorted in the system better
22:46 - or um
22:47 - i mean i would say yes in general yes i
22:50 - would say
22:51 - if you could look at the job description
22:53 - of the role that you're applying to and
22:55 - look for exactly the sort of things that
22:57 - they're looking for
22:58 - um
23:00 - i mean i guess you could think of it as
23:02 - looking for keywords but more so just
23:04 - actually look and read what they're
23:05 - looking for and if that matches to what
23:07 - you're doing
23:08 - let's say you use a word like
23:10 - communication instead of public
23:12 - relations and you can replace those
23:14 - words and that would help you then that
23:16 - that's fine but i wouldn't go adding
23:18 - things that you actually don't have
23:20 - experience with just to increase your
23:22 - level of keywords because you still
23:24 - won't be relevant
23:25 - if you if you don't have that experience
23:28 - okay and i mean i guess
23:31 - that also goes into
23:33 - knowing the company you're applying for
23:34 - right i mean some companies have a very
23:36 - automated process right where you submit
23:38 - a resume and like a minute later
23:40 - literally 60 seconds later you get an
23:42 - automated email saying sorry you didn't
23:44 - get a in this role whatever and that
23:46 - wasn't a human being right that was they
23:47 - had like a i don't know how they called
23:49 - it has an acronym like this they call it
23:50 - ats
23:52 - yeah application
23:53 - uh tracking systems yeah yeah so i know
23:56 - that sometimes so i guess that's that's
23:58 - also part of like doing your due
24:00 - diligence when you're applying for a
24:01 - company okay uh this company has this
24:03 - sort of systems so i need to make sure
24:05 - that i i pass the hurdle first right um
24:08 - and do what i have to do
24:10 - um that's pretty cool do you have any
24:12 - other like
24:14 - examples of things not to do in a resume
24:16 - that seems to be very common or like
24:18 - people should avoid is there anything
24:19 - that you come across a lot
24:22 - um
24:23 - i i think you know sometimes people put
24:26 - their entire addresses on a resume and
24:28 - that's not necessary
24:30 - it's actually a safety concern you
24:31 - should probably just put you know this
24:33 - you want to disclose your location which
24:35 - you don't have to do you could just put
24:36 - the city and the state or the city in
24:38 - the country you don't have to put your
24:40 - entire address or po box because no
24:42 - one's actually
24:44 - mailing you anything that's a that's
24:46 - something they did in the past not now
24:48 - we're going to email you um i think
24:50 - another thing is just being really wild
24:52 - with
24:53 - with templates uh okay this can be very
24:56 - fun
24:57 - um and they don't have to be you know
24:59 - black and white straight up and down you
25:01 - can add color and even add a picture if
25:03 - you want if that makes you feel good
25:05 - uh
25:06 - but i think sometimes i see
25:08 - really well templates that i'm like this
25:10 - is actually too far
25:12 - especially in technical resumes because
25:15 - they try to you know do whatever they
25:17 - can to explain express their you know
25:20 - design
25:21 - um abilities um and i would still make
25:24 - it readable still make it you know
25:26 - similar to a resume and i would even do
25:29 - an approved template
25:31 - uh just to be safe but if you wanted to
25:32 - design your own template i would just
25:34 - make sure that it's still very
25:36 - professional um and that it fits the the
25:39 - the brand of the company that you're
25:42 - applying to so if you're applying to
25:44 - code academy um yeah we're fun but we're
25:47 - also you know a company that cares
25:50 - worked on it yeah every company that
25:52 - cares about clarity um and you know
25:56 - communication that is
25:58 - pretty professional so i would i would
26:00 - still take it seriously
26:02 - i think uh you know that that's actually
26:04 - a great segue for another question i had
26:05 - to for you that was
26:07 - about templates um google does this
26:10 - thing called uh grow with google or
26:11 - something like that it's like this kind
26:12 - of like one hour
26:14 - mini courses that they do offer
26:16 - online on demand um and i actually
26:18 - attended one for resumes and stuff and
26:21 - the first thing that they tell you is go
26:23 - to your google drive and create a new uh
26:25 - wrestling template and
26:28 - i'm curious to know
26:30 - templating seems to be one of those
26:31 - things where if everybody does it then
26:33 - the recruiter is going to be trained
26:35 - to recognize that design and it might
26:37 - actually give you an advantage because
26:39 - the developer knows where the experience
26:42 - section is where the skill section is
26:43 - because you've seen that template a
26:44 - thousand times so it's kind of like
26:46 - so it might give you an advantage in
26:47 - that sense that makes it easier to read
26:49 - for the for the recovery because they've
26:50 - seen it before but at the same time
26:52 - sometimes people will say well it's it's
26:54 - a template so you're not showing any
26:56 - interest real like this is like a copy
26:58 - and paste from the other 100 places you
27:00 - apply so some recruiters might look at
27:02 - them be like well this is a template
27:03 - which means that they don't care they
27:04 - didn't put enough effort into this
27:06 - do do you have you seen that in the past
27:08 - that
27:09 - how templating
27:11 - can go both ways
27:13 - i i can understand how that could be the
27:16 - case but like i said at cogatomi we
27:19 - don't we don't uh reject candidates
27:21 - based off things like that are a bit
27:23 - more trivial like their template now if
27:25 - they have a bunch of typos in their
27:27 - resume like that's not a good sign but
27:29 - if you generally have the experiences
27:32 - and you use a basic template i'm not
27:34 - going to be like oh this person's using
27:36 - didn't care about doing a different
27:37 - template i'm going to say this person
27:39 - has experiences i want to hire them so i
27:41 - don't think that i think that template
27:44 - and the style and the format that you
27:46 - present your resume and as long as it's
27:47 - professional
27:48 - the actual decoration of it uh is
27:51 - probably less than five percent of
27:54 - the importance of getting you across
27:56 - that you know to the next step
27:59 - but i i think your experience will be 90
28:02 - of what's relevant okay
28:04 - great uh and i know that uh
28:06 - you also mentioned this uh with the
28:08 - address saying nobody send you letters
28:09 - anymore so modern day restroom is
28:12 - is it is it more common place now for
28:15 - applicants especially for technical
28:16 - roles to include uh urls uh to their
28:19 - linkedin profile or their github repo
28:22 - things like that is is that more
28:23 - commonplace now or like at the top right
28:25 - under your name or something that is
28:26 - like
28:27 - links to pages
28:29 - is it like normal now like no vacuum is
28:31 - gonna scoff at that or be like this is
28:33 - poor taste or something
28:35 - yeah i think i think it's really um it's
28:37 - really common and in my experience it's
28:39 - actually pretty helpful if someone links
28:41 - their linkedin and doesn't just like
28:43 - because some people would just put the
28:44 - html
28:46 - uh like the whole web address uh which
28:49 - is fine as well i could copy and paste
28:51 - but if someone links their linkedin i'm
28:53 - gonna much easier click on that and go
28:55 - to it then i would copy and paste
28:57 - someone's uh the same thing with their
28:59 - projects and with their personal website
29:02 - so but i don't think it's a it's not a
29:05 - necessary component like if i if you
29:08 - were really a great candidate and i
29:09 - wanted to go look at your website or
29:11 - your projects i will copy and paste the
29:12 - link or google it uh but it's helpful if
29:15 - you have those links
29:17 - and obviously uh this is with the caveat
29:19 - that we're in the us and there's people
29:20 - watching from all over the world like i
29:22 - know in some countries they expect you
29:23 - to include profile pictures for example
29:25 - where in the u.s we don't uh so
29:27 - obviously uh for everybody watching
29:29 - remember that um what we were talking
29:31 - about is kind of like u.s centric a
29:32 - little bit that might be different in
29:34 - the country there in and maybe
29:36 - maybe including links to your github
29:38 - repo it's bad taste in the country
29:40 - living so just keep that in mind
29:42 - uh you know you have to play by the
29:43 - rules of where you live
29:45 - um you know we actually touched on a lot
29:48 - of things i don't know if you wanna if
29:50 - you wanna
29:51 - offer any sort of general advice or we
29:53 - can go straight into q a
29:55 - um
29:56 - the last thing i would say is generally
29:59 - i think
30:00 - uh linkedin's can be a bit
30:02 - touchy and or maybe you know someone may
30:04 - not put as much energy into their
30:06 - linkedin as they with their resume
30:08 - and i would say it's still important
30:10 - even though they serve different
30:12 - capacities and they're they're not
30:13 - necessarily interchangeable
30:15 - they're still both individually
30:17 - important and it should be individually
30:19 - strong
30:21 - nice yeah and i think uh it's something
30:23 - that people don't wanna they don't like
30:25 - but it's still the rules of the game
30:26 - sort of uh when they say hey make sure
30:28 - that the photo in your profile photo in
30:30 - linkedin is like not blurry that you
30:31 - look normal yeah like whatever it's kind
30:34 - of like well that shouldn't matter who i
30:35 - am what i know it's like i know i know
30:37 - but someone that doesn't know you is
30:39 - still going to look at that photo and
30:41 - their brain is going to make a judgment
30:43 - call out of that and and i know it's
30:45 - terrible and you don't want to be judged
30:46 - on like you were wearing t-shirt and
30:48 - flip-flops in the beach but at the end
30:49 - of the day you're trying to get a job
30:52 - and if yeah
30:53 - you know so there's little details like
30:54 - that on linkedin like you said uh
30:56 - sometimes people don't put effort on
30:57 - linkedin and it might make a difference
31:00 - even if you don't think that's important
31:02 - it's not about what you think it's about
31:03 - what the recruiters think right yeah
31:05 - especially if you're trying to get into
31:07 - web development or something that is you
31:09 - know front end facing we want to know
31:11 - that you have like
31:12 - a solid uh understanding of how to you
31:15 - know navigate something like a linkedin
31:17 - profile which is on the web you know so
31:20 - you're lying in a linkedin profile and
31:22 - it's like the gray
31:23 - figurehead like there's no photo or
31:25 - anything like oh no i mean i would like
31:27 - again we wouldn't reject someone because
31:29 - of it but it would i mean i the photo
31:32 - i'm not really big on is the rest of the
31:34 - profile like you know what i don't have
31:36 - a banner either there's no banner image
31:38 - there's no profile well you know how we
31:40 - see their bio is one line i like what
31:43 - about like one
31:45 - i mean that wouldn't be a bad thing if
31:47 - they had details under their jobs or if
31:49 - they had skills that they listed um or
31:51 - if they had a link to their website but
31:53 - just having nothing um
31:56 - and just a couple of jobs and it's
31:58 - outdated and we don't know if you're
31:59 - still there
32:00 - that's when it's like okay
32:02 - can this person be a web developer
32:04 - because
32:06 - they don't even uh update their linkedin
32:09 - i feel like um you know what it's kind
32:11 - of one of those things instead of
32:12 - thinking of like um there's two ways i
32:15 - think of thinking like this
32:16 - um you start with 100 points and you
32:18 - lose points every time you make a
32:20 - mistake that's one way of thinking about
32:21 - this i think recruiting the way that
32:22 - you're saying like well a photo is not
32:24 - going to make me reject somebody i feel
32:26 - like
32:27 - it's the other way around you start at
32:28 - zero points and you're trying to add
32:30 - points to your account to the point
32:31 - where the recruiter wants to talk to you
32:33 - in a phone interview or a technical
32:34 - interview so
32:35 - oh you don't have a profile photo okay
32:37 - well that's plus zero like you you
32:39 - didn't gain you didn't lose oh you then
32:41 - put a good bio in your linkedin well
32:43 - that's not a negative but it's not a
32:44 - positive and if we have a hundred
32:46 - applicants for this maybe the other ones
32:48 - did a better job than you did right so
32:50 - that's exactly it's kind of like
32:51 - it's like a basketball game or like any
32:53 - sports game like you're just adding
32:54 - points to your scoreboard so i think
32:56 - you're right i think you're right about
32:58 - that
32:59 - so like yeah you're not gonna get
33:00 - rejected but you might not get chosen
33:02 - either just because you didn't you know
33:04 - spend an hour one afternoon making your
33:06 - linkedin more polished uh polished
33:08 - yeah um cool let's go uh let's go for
33:12 - some q a here um yeah so at the end of
33:14 - every live stream everyone watching we
33:17 - always do some q a and i'm gonna go
33:18 - through the chat
33:20 - looking at what people were asking
33:24 - let's see if i can find some questions
33:27 - somebody was wondering about
33:28 - transitioning from different kinds of
33:30 - career what should they put in terms of
33:32 - the past jobs okay so i think this
33:34 - question is more about um
33:35 - when you have experience but it's in a
33:37 - different field
33:39 - do you is there any way
33:41 - is any particular where like better than
33:44 - way of highlighting experience that
33:46 - might be relevant for the job but it's
33:48 - not in the field that you're applying
33:49 - for
33:51 - um
33:53 - i think what i i i think what i would
33:55 - not do
33:56 - is lie about the previous jobs or
34:00 - uh
34:02 - change the previous jobs in a way to
34:04 - make it seem like you are always doing
34:06 - this thing i wouldn't do that like less
34:08 - like if you were a librarian
34:11 - and now you're transitioning into
34:13 - engineering you put on your resume all
34:16 - previous librarian jobs everything i did
34:18 - had to do i t like i wouldn't do that
34:20 - because it doesn't actually serve
34:22 - serve you i think i think the best thing
34:25 - you could do is um
34:27 - be short and be honest about what you
34:30 - did um and like i said before add in a
34:32 - cover letter and an objective that says
34:35 - i'm pivoting careers i'm excited about
34:37 - this i'm passionate for the next steps
34:40 - and this is the work that i've done to
34:41 - get towards that next career but i think
34:44 - it depends on the years of experience
34:45 - that you have in that previous career uh
34:48 - like if you have 10 years of experience
34:51 - as a chef before you went into
34:53 - engineering
34:54 - i wouldn't put every job you had i would
34:57 - put maybe one or two jobs let's say if
34:59 - you had one job for a long period of
35:01 - time that job and then maybe just put
35:03 - chef
35:04 - various companies uh x amount of years
35:08 - or let's say you only did it for four
35:10 - years um that you were a chef before you
35:13 - transitioned then i would just put you
35:15 - know chef various companies list the
35:16 - companies list some of the roles that
35:18 - you did but i wouldn't add all the
35:20 - details and all of the examples that you
35:23 - add under
35:24 - your engineering projects because if you
35:27 - do that then it may take up too much
35:29 - visual space and you need that visual
35:31 - space to demonstrate your interest
35:34 - and to talk about your projects and so i
35:36 - mean if you if you spend 70 percent of
35:39 - your visual resume space talking about
35:41 - your previous industry then we will
35:44 - assume
35:45 - that you are you know not fully
35:47 - transitioned versus if you spend 70
35:49 - percent of time talking about the
35:50 - engineering role that you're going after
35:52 - then it'll be like okay well they're
35:54 - transitioning they have projects now um
35:56 - they have things to talk about
35:58 - okay cool yeah so focus on the goal yeah
36:00 - uh i know that uh other
36:02 - oh people have talked to
36:04 - uh mentioned something similar which is
36:06 - only mention the bars that are relevant
36:08 - for the role so like oh okay you were a
36:10 - chef and you were you had like three
36:12 - shoe chefs under you or you had like
36:14 - these people whatever oh you've been
36:15 - managing inventory for the uh for the
36:17 - kitchen the wine like yeah if you're
36:19 - applying for a role where you can
36:20 - highlight your communication skills or
36:22 - your team leadership skills or whatever
36:24 - like cool mention that like there's
36:25 - nothing wrong with that yeah it's a
36:26 - different industry but people are people
36:29 - like it's just you know so i know that
36:31 - um that tends to be kind of like don't
36:33 - be ashamed that you weren't working in
36:35 - the job that you were you're applying
36:36 - for that's why you're applying for the
36:37 - job
36:38 - be sincere with the job experience you
36:40 - had and just highlight the parts that
36:42 - are relevant i guess
36:43 - yeah right
36:45 - i would agree yeah
36:46 - yeah uh let's see
36:48 - other questions
36:50 - be honest and be myself yeah yeah very
36:52 - much uh these users are saying yeah
36:54 - that's uh that's what we just said let's
36:55 - just be honest
36:57 - um because at the end of the day you
36:59 - don't want to work at a place that
37:00 - doesn't want you to be honest anyways
37:02 - right like that that's just that's also
37:04 - from your perspective as a candidate you
37:05 - you want to work at a place that that
37:07 - also nurtures that kind of
37:09 - mentality
37:12 - what about the fresh news okay so
37:14 - somebody some people are wondering about
37:17 - college degrees versus
37:19 - self-made portfolios
37:21 - and they're wondering if there's like
37:23 - one that is better than the other or if
37:25 - they go hand-in-hand or like so
37:28 - i get obviously every company is gonna
37:30 - be different here at code academy i'm
37:31 - assuming
37:33 - that we don't really
37:35 - put a preference
37:36 - in like if you have a degree or not like
37:38 - i guess it depends on the role that
37:39 - we're looking for
37:41 - i would actually be interested and i
37:44 - would i'd be interested in the stats of
37:45 - how many people echo academy came
37:47 - through like self learning or boot camp
37:49 - or some alternative education method
37:51 - versus uh like cs or data science degree
37:55 - i i i would think maybe it would lean a
37:57 - little bit more towards degree but it
37:59 - would probably be
38:01 - like 60 40. um
38:03 - i don't think that well i know for sure
38:06 - that it's not that it's not necessary to
38:08 - have a degree um it's about whether or
38:11 - not you can do the work and you have the
38:13 - experience to showcase that you've done
38:14 - the work
38:16 - so if you have if you've been
38:18 - self-learning like the first example i
38:20 - gave was of the pilot himself learned
38:22 - through coke academy for the past year
38:23 - he had experiences he had projects he
38:27 - had links and certificates he he
38:29 - demonstrated that he was doing the work
38:31 - if you can demonstrate that you know how
38:34 - to do the work that's what we care about
38:36 - if you get interview you know what
38:37 - you're talking about and you could pass
38:39 - a technical assessment that's what
38:41 - matters not because someone who you know
38:43 - has a degree you know may not
38:45 - necessarily be
38:47 - so familiar with those concepts that
38:48 - they could pass a technical assessment
38:50 - or they may not be the best at that so i
38:52 - would say really just focus on
38:55 - demonstrating your experiences and
38:57 - that's what matters more
38:59 - mileage may vary uh or kilometer may
39:02 - vary depending on where you are in the
39:03 - world uh metric system
39:05 - um
39:06 - i have i actually have a great example
39:08 - for this something i learned last week
39:09 - that is one of our administrators one of
39:11 - the admins on our discord community he's
39:14 - been self-teaching himself code for the
39:16 - past year and a half or something and he
39:18 - actually landed a job pre-pandemic but
39:20 - because the pandemic came around the
39:21 - lockdowns he that that offer got
39:23 - rescinded
39:24 - uh so he spent a year keep teaching
39:26 - himself and
39:28 - this person
39:29 - didn't actually have a portfolio like
39:31 - they just they collaborated with so many
39:34 - open source projects online and they
39:36 - collaborated with so many people and
39:37 - they connected with so many that that
39:40 - developers in companies were like dude
39:42 - are you working somewhere no you're what
39:43 - that's so and they started giving him
39:45 - referrals like hey i'm gonna put you in
39:47 - contact with my recruiting group and
39:48 - like
39:49 - you know people like we need people like
39:50 - you and like so so it just kind of like
39:52 - happened for him he was just like
39:53 - getting online and
39:55 - you know working on projects and it was
39:57 - very
39:58 - typical yeah not the typical like i have
40:00 - my three pro projects here i'm gonna
40:02 - start applying it was more like people
40:04 - saying why aren't you working yet and
40:06 - yeah and kind of like so i think that
40:08 - goes that goes kind of like that idea of
40:10 - companies look for different places
40:12 - different people and different
40:13 - backgrounds and
40:15 - some job descriptions
40:16 - will say straight out bachelor's degree
40:19 - require and others will not and if they
40:21 - don't they don't like that's just right
40:24 - like don't worry about it
40:26 - yeah
40:27 - yeah
40:28 - agreed i did have a candidate who
40:30 - who
40:31 - we hired who for a subject matter expert
40:35 - role
40:36 - and i he did not have a degree but he
40:39 - worked on a bunch of different things he
40:40 - had so much experience and the most the
40:43 - most great thing about his experience
40:45 - was that he had uh like completely
40:49 - he had like done so many open source
40:51 - projects that he was like running the
40:52 - open source board for
40:54 - for one particular field and it was just
40:57 - sort of like we don't it's no it's no
40:59 - option like because we have to hire this
41:01 - person because he knows exactly what
41:03 - he's talking about i'm pretty sure he
41:05 - built this
41:06 - this software like
41:08 - not even for a junior role
41:10 - yeah
41:11 - it was for like a part time
41:13 - yeah so i'm like yeah
41:16 - it's about the experiences
41:18 - yeah definitely so yeah i would
41:20 - encourage anyone watching this not don't
41:21 - get caught up in like the traditional
41:24 - uh divisions of like college degree not
41:26 - college degree things like that uh
41:28 - that's changing especially in tech
41:30 - uh that's changing a lot it's shifting
41:33 - um and in fact uh platforms like code
41:35 - academy they're so valuable for that
41:38 - for that specific reason because more
41:40 - and more companies are realizing you
41:41 - know college degrees are great but you
41:43 - can learn the stuff someplace else and
41:45 - that's why they're boot camps and
41:46 - there's all these places um
41:49 - let's see
41:50 - someone is asking about job gaps so how
41:53 - do you deal with what if you had a job
41:54 - then a couple years went by and then you
41:56 - have no jobs um is there any way of like
42:00 - i don't know how to embellish that in
42:02 - the resume or like yeah
42:04 - what is that
42:05 - is that something that yeah is that a
42:07 - red flag for a recruit like you're
42:08 - looking at up down seven seconds and you
42:11 - see
42:11 - 2021 to 2019 and then 2017. is this
42:15 - something you go whoa what happened
42:18 - um
42:19 - uh
42:20 - i mean i think it's very common that
42:22 - people have job gaps so i i don't think
42:25 - that it is weird um i think people would
42:28 - like recruiters would probably ask you
42:30 - about it like hey and notice that this
42:32 - time was uh if you don't say it in your
42:34 - cover letter or your objective um or if
42:36 - you don't say it on the resume um they
42:38 - might ask you about it just to clarify
42:40 - that it wasn't something that you take
42:42 - that you took out of your resume and it
42:43 - was a job gap um i've seen some really
42:46 - clever things that people have done
42:48 - especially on linkedin like i saw one
42:50 - person had on their linkedin traveling
42:53 - world 2019 to 2020 and then they were
42:56 - like
42:56 - you know then they have their new job
42:58 - 2021 after that and it was just sort of
43:00 - like okay
43:02 - um and you know i'm not mad at you for
43:04 - traveling
43:06 - i think um if you can be honest about
43:08 - that and
43:10 - i think i think you anyone who has those
43:13 - sort of gaps wants their employer to
43:15 - to be able to um allow them to do that
43:18 - or just you know see them as a human
43:20 - being and so i don't think that you have
43:22 - to shy away from that i think we're in
43:24 - an age where you can really be honest
43:25 - about it or just leave it off and say i
43:28 - wasn't working and then i started back
43:29 - here um you know my stepmom is one who
43:33 - stepped away from from work for like six
43:35 - years to raise um babies and so that's a
43:40 - like that's a lot of years in terms of
43:42 - her management experience but she still
43:44 - has all these years of experience and i
43:45 - was just helping her write her resume
43:47 - and she was like you know how do i do i
43:48 - even address it do i say anything i was
43:50 - like no just just skip it don't say
43:52 - anything if you if you want to say
43:54 - raising family you can but i don't think
43:56 - you have to give them that much
43:57 - information you could just skip it and
43:59 - put you know whatever let's say you've
44:01 - been doing volunteer experience during
44:03 - that time or um you
44:05 - took taking a class during that time
44:06 - just put that information and just focus
44:08 - on um what you have to give as opposed
44:11 - to drawing too much attention if you
44:13 - don't want to
44:15 - yeah okay yeah so again be sincere but
44:18 - yeah get creative i guess you can be a
44:20 - little creative like doing classes
44:22 - volunteering work traveling i guess
44:24 - enjoying your life building a family uh
44:27 - i know that that's a big one uh facebook
44:29 - had a program a few years ago that was
44:30 - something like
44:31 - re-engaging
44:33 - the force either i forget the name of
44:35 - the initiative but they were basically
44:37 - looking for people specifically with job
44:39 - with job gaps with gaps in their
44:41 - timelines where they were like these are
44:42 - the people that want to help uh you know
44:45 - get jobs on facebook and stuff because
44:46 - you know we believe that that's not a
44:48 - burden that's not a negative
44:50 - um someone had a question earlier during
44:53 - our conversation about formatting cover
44:55 - letters and i don't know if you do
44:56 - resumes and cover letters like i guess
44:58 - you do a bit of everything
45:01 - is there like a typical structure for
45:03 - cover letters that seems to work better
45:05 - like i think that it's like a intro
45:06 - yourself
45:07 - second paragraph it's about your
45:09 - experience and third paragraph is
45:12 - you fit in the company things like that
45:13 - like there's like a one two three like
45:15 - is there like a recipe for this
45:17 - i there probably is uh my favorite type
45:21 - of cover letter is one paragraph real
45:23 - quick
45:24 - one paragraph cover letter
45:27 - it is simple it is concise it isn't some
45:30 - people in the cover letters they'll tell
45:32 - you the company's mission statement
45:33 - they'll take the company's values
45:35 - they'll talk about their 20 years of
45:36 - experience and they'll repeat what's on
45:38 - their resume well that's actually not
45:40 - what i'm looking for i'm looking for how
45:41 - you fit for this job
45:43 - and that doesn't mean elaborate on every
45:46 - job that you had that means give me high
45:48 - level why you're in why you're a fit for
45:50 - this job
45:51 - um
45:52 - and
45:53 - yeah letters don't have to be a letter
45:55 - it sounds to me like it doesn't have to
45:57 - be a whole 500 500 word page
46:01 - well the thing is that people take it
46:03 - and they will write three pages of a
46:05 - cover letter or they'll oh wow or
46:07 - they'll make the font size 9.5 and
46:10 - expand the margins and they'll put so
46:12 - much information in one page
46:14 - and it's just like no one is re like we
46:16 - don't want to read all that we want to
46:18 - read concise information that explains
46:20 - exactly how you're fit for this job we
46:22 - know that you're passionate we know that
46:23 - you're interested we want to know why
46:25 - you're fit um and so that that that's
46:28 - the important part of cover letters
46:29 - you know talking about getting creative
46:31 - with gaps so
46:32 - if you had a gap in 2020 because of the
46:34 - pandemic could you just do you think
46:35 - that would be totally fine for somebody
46:36 - to be like
46:37 - 20 20 pandemic it's just like i lost my
46:41 - job it's it's it is what it is
46:43 - i've seen it i've seen
46:45 - uh they'll put during they'll put in in
46:48 - parentheses
46:49 - um
46:50 - left you know out of work due to covert
46:53 - layoffs or i've i've also seen uh people
46:56 - just say um you know pandemic family
47:00 - leave like people will be very open and
47:02 - honest about you know things and i don't
47:04 - think it's a bad thing i think we
47:06 - on the other side of that paper really
47:08 - understand okay i was there too i know
47:10 - how it felt like i know people were
47:12 - doing all types of things and there's no
47:14 - judgment
47:15 - at least at cocademy now other companies
47:17 - i'm not sure how they'll judge people
47:19 - but i'm sure that people are just as
47:20 - human as we are um and they will try to
47:24 - give you the benefit of the doubt
47:26 - all right you heard it here before i
47:27 - mean first
47:28 - uh
47:30 - before i'm first uh okay last question
47:32 - uh somebody's wondering about the
47:34 - language and resumes and they're
47:35 - thinking about there's like a passive
47:37 - tone an active tone um
47:40 - another different ways that you can
47:41 - portray information in the resume um is
47:44 - there any way that you recommend is
47:46 - there anything that
47:48 - that tends to be the norm or kind of
47:50 - like the the rule of thumb for writing
47:51 - resumes um
47:54 - active versus passive i think the rule
47:55 - of thumb is definitely active language
47:58 - uh
47:59 - i'm trying to think exactly what that
48:02 - looks like and i can't really pinpoint
48:04 - it but i know that uh
48:07 - the main thing of resumes is that you
48:09 - just want to get to the point as quickly
48:10 - as possible and passive language sort of
48:12 - takes you on a little bit of a journey
48:14 - to get there
48:15 - so if you can you know say
48:17 - teacher talk kids
48:19 - wrote assignments did this like just be
48:22 - very concise and very poignant about
48:24 - what you're saying uh then i i wouldn't
48:27 - i wouldn't spend too much time on the
48:29 - other details
48:31 - okay yeah i think we just keep coming
48:33 - back to this idea of like there's
48:35 - limited time and yeah real estate for a
48:37 - recruiter they're gonna look at it for
48:39 - so many seconds and their eyes can only
48:41 - look at so many words so don't go in
48:44 - circles don't do anything weird just
48:47 - just say this is who i am and this is
48:48 - what i know exactly and the recruiter
48:51 - will give you a thumbs up no problem
48:54 - okay well it's been awesome uh i think i
48:56 - learned a lot i'm walking out of this uh
48:57 - feeling like i'm ready to apply for jobs
48:59 - maybe okay
49:05 - i'm glad that we got to answer some
49:06 - questions from the audience um we do
49:08 - this every week guys by the way so
49:11 - next week we're going to have somebody
49:12 - else online live answering questions
49:14 - another recruiter from code academy so
49:16 - just stop by just keep checking our
49:18 - kodakami youtube channel and i'll catch
49:20 - you in the next ones thank you so much
49:21 - gemini uh any parting thoughts
49:24 - uh no i'm excited to see resumes all
49:27 - clean and concise out there in the world
49:29 - all right being concise thank you so
49:31 - much everybody goodbye
49:33 - thank you
49:38 - and that's the stream

Cleaned transcript:

go live cool so now we are definitely live hello everybody for those watching live and for those that will watch in the future uh we are in another episode of tips and tricks and recruiting and today we have the one and only giovanni you want to introduce yourself uh tell me a little bit about your background maybe sure uh my name is joveney carter um i'm an associate recruiter with ko academy and i've been with kocademy since uh september oh my anniversary just passed so september 7th last year so about a year now thank you and um i'm i recruit mostly for the curriculum roles right now which include um like a a a decent level of technical um abilities uh but i've also done some recruiting for uh people team like hr roles uh talent roles some a couple of other like product manager roles things like that um but right now i'm mostly in curriculum did you always knew that you wanted to be a recruiter was it like you know you were eight and you said you know mom i want to be a recruiter no no that's not how it works i didn't even really know that it was a career stage but um coming out of uh college i knew that i didn't want to get into consulting but i wanted to do something that had like stability and i had a friend that said oh you're you know a people person you'd be really good at this and i went into executive search um which is sort of like consulting but it's more uh people oriented and so i was like okay i like this um and then as i was in the executive search role i really enjoyed uh just like power structures and you know being able to be able to influence the people who are making decisions um and how it really can change the whole scope of a company so that's why i'm a career now okay yeah i mean i didn't know what community was either until somebody told me so it's one of those roles i think that it's not very clearly defined but then once you discover it's like oh this is actually really cool awesome great yeah i can do this yeah so now that you're focusing here on code academy you've been focusing you said mostly on hiring for curriculum team uh i would imagine that you come across a large spectrum of people from all kinds of backgrounds all kinds of expertise right like because being a curriculum developer is not very straightforward either i guess like um it's not like saying well i'm a mechanical engineer and i build engines like like that's a very kind of like stray arrow sort of knowledge i would imagine that for curriculum developers depending on the field what they do comes from all kinds of places so do you you know um one thing i wanted to ask you was how you see because a lot of learners in code academy also have this kind of diversity in background how do you see these kind of backgrounds playing in stem or like pros and cons when you are trying to apply for you know tech companies like getting to the technical field is that like is that something that you need to worry about is that pretty common spread you know that's a really good question i do see that all the time where learners or just people from various backgrounds are applying to roles and i think people from a lot of backgrounds will apply to curriculum roles especially because it is a it is a interdisciplinary role where you have to have the technical abilities and some technical experience to say well i've i've coded before i know what four stack is like i i could teach these things but then secondly you have to have some sort of teaching education experience um to be able to really demonstrate like strong pedagogy um and so because of those two fields sometimes i'll get people to always left left field all the way right field uh but uh there are very few times where there are people that are like straight up and down the middle um but we're not necessarily looking for someone that's up and down like has has somehow been a coding teacher all their life um we're really looking for people who just have been able to demonstrate experience in both fields so let's say that let's say that you were previously i actually had this this this um candidate once who was a pilot in their previous career uh yeah and um we ended up moving forward i think he was a parttime hire for a while but uh he was interviewing for a parttime role a parttime curriculum uh like frontend you know content creation role something like that and um he uh had actually he didn't do a boot camp or anything he had done like he had fully learned on co academy for like the past year and he had several projects to prove his expertise and so he had the projects to prove his expertise and um he had written blogs or something like that about his learning experience as he was going through that and so he sort of fulfilled the two main parts that we needed which was like his writing experience being able to teach other people but also his technical experience um so it's not that you have to have five year career in this it just has you you just really need to demonstrate um both now that was a parttime role and you know different roles at different levels like if you're going for a uh like a midlevel role you're gonna have have to have of course like three to five years of experience something more but that's just an example of like it doesn't need to be one solid background i feel like there's a lot to impact there um you mentioned you know having projects to demonstrate your knowledge uh blogging where you're trying to kind of like be out there and be proactive with showcasing your work uh you mentioned that he was selftaught showing that drive on like you know i'm gonna go through walls and and learn what i need to learn to land a job also knowing the platform that he was applying for like i want to get a job at code academy and i'm like very familiar with how good academy works the learning environment the course work everything so like there's a lot of them back i think there's there was a lot of things going for him and i know that uh my conversations with other recruiters they've touched on those things too where they will say well you need to research where you're going to apply for you know know where why you are applying for that company in particular so when you are in that phone interview and that's screening it's like you know what to say uh you know demonstrate that you know what you say you know on paper and the work on projects portfolios connect with people right so i feel like they take away basically is don't worry too much about what you perceive as being your background or like where you think that you stand and just worry more about what they're looking for right because i mean i think all the recruiters have mentioned this in the past that's like companies when they're recruiting they basically have like an idea of the candidate they're looking for so the company is going out there looking for that person which means that you basically has the applicant need to make sure that you fit into that mold basically is that is that right uh more or less yeah i i think i think you you just have to convince the recruiter or the hiring team that either you fit into that mode or that they can extend their mode to fit you um and and that doesn't have to be uh i think there are some extremes of that where people who may have like no experience in the specific field that they're interested are applying to like let's say they're uh they have a full stack experience but they don't have a lot of experience with mobile development um then and they haven't really developed ios apps it's gonna be much harder to convince the hiring team that you're going to be able to you know contribute early and often for a mobile development role if you actually haven't developed at all in ios and so the best thing you could do is put together a couple of projects and then go apply for that role if that's something that you really want um i think i think you're absolutely right like being prepared for the roles that you're applying to and being um intentional about the roles that you're applying to and not just being like i could fit this i can do this because uh if you if you like don't really have that that's a real thing right technical feel yeah i mean well people do that all the time but i feel like i feel like i've heard it before like they're saying well this person is kind of like a tr a jack of all trades but that's not what we're looking for like yeah good for you that you know a lot of things but we are only looking for this role to fail with this particular skill set and i've heard before that the the idea that some candidates it's not there's nothing really wrong with with well how they approach what they know it's just that you you don't really you don't necessarily care about the things that don't apply for the role in particular right so so sometimes there's that kind of like um it's almost country intuitive which is like you know too much or like you don't seem to be focused enough like we are hiring somebody to be a curriculum developer it seems that you could be also an engineer how do we know that you want to be a curriculum developer right you don't want to be an engineer right right you have to somehow demonstrate in your experiences or in your cover letter or something that this is actually what you want and not just you're just throwing your resume out there to anything because a lot of people do that too okay yeah yeah i think uh i mean there's always a worry about overfitting like oh you're too perfect molded into this but then i'm assuming that there's also a part where it's like this candidate is not focused enough it's like not not like concentrated enough so we i can't make a call if this person is going to be with us in six months because maybe for them this is just kind of like a stepping stone to some some other place right um and obviously for a company you want to hire somebody who's going to help the team which means that you know you can't just like keep a revolving door sort of so to speak i guess so speaking of concentrating and speaking of showcasing that work i'm assuming that you go through a lot of resonance like your fair bit of reading through resumes yeah i have a few questions about restaurants and i think the learners that are going to be watching this video live or later are probably having the same questions one of my questions is when you write a resume does it always have to be one page you'd be surprised how many people submit several page resumes okay um uh at co academy we don't automatically reject someone because of something what we being trivial to be like the length of their resume or the layout of their resume things like that um so we are try we try to be as um compassionate about that as possible at other camp companies i don't know what they do they probably if you have a multiple page resume they may not look at it it's not necessarily that it's not it's not um it's a volume thing right it's like you got 10 cents yeah it's like are they gonna get you up about seven seconds do you think they're gonna read that second page do you think they're gonna read the third page no um i know i know people also say that you know it depends on the years of experience like i get a lot of phd candidates and they submit their cvs that's a very different style of uh background um and i recognize that when i see their can their resume and i'm like okay well this is fcv this is all their articles published and it's actually relevant but if you've like been a software engineer at the same company for the past seven years you don't necessarily need three pages to demonstrate your work i know that i think it was harlan that mentions like look i'm looking up to them right that's how we read if i don't see anything that interests me that sparks my curious like oh this could be a good candidate that's it that's the end of the line like you just need to make sure that there's something and he said you know i don't mind spending some extra time and i can't that i'm pulling up the linkedin or something but but something has to spark the first interest yeah right yeah so i know that uh some learners especially now in 2021 with you know after the pandemic last year there was so much emphasis on being online and your wrestlemans traditionally are a very like paper so like even now right we write it as a document um platforms like linkedin have tried to virtualize or digitize a resume where it's a bit more like a website um how do you see the role of like resumes traditional resumes versus putting your content out there in places like linkedin is that is do they complement each other can they replace each other like is is the resume still like a very strong part of applying for any tech role that you've seen i think they complement each other but they serve different purposes uh like if you're applying to a job you may submit your linkedin profile but what i'm gonna see first is your resume uh versus if i'm sourcing people so if i'm looking on linkedin for people to fill a certain role the first thing i'm gonna see is your linkedin and then later i might ask you for your resume so i think that they support one another but they don't necessarily replace each other i think they do different things one is digital one is very like pointed um well they're both sort of digital one is like a website and one is very pointed to what you what your interests are or it should be uh like a lot of people in their current jobs won't display on their linkedin exactly what they're looking for because their employers see their linkedin um but on their resume they might say i'm actually looking for pivot careers i'm looking into this and so that that piece of the puzzle is is important oh that's interesting so there's a part um i'm thinking about resumes and the structure of it um you're saying that in some resumes people write like a bit of uh objective or gold or like a section like so so you think that that's helpful like people that are thinking of applying for jobs having like uh maybe what like two lines like how how does this actually structure i think it's super helpful to have like an intro like some sort of because what you really have to do right in the resume you have to guide the readers attention to where you want it to be and almost guide their perspective to what you want them to see and so if you write an objective and it says hi i am a full stack engineer looking for roles in this team like that automatically puts me in the space of okay so this experience should be like this or if their experience isn't this then i know from their objective that they're interested in this versus if they submit their resume and it doesn't match the experience that we're looking for and they don't have any sort of cover letter or objective census that says i'm looking for this sort of role then i'm just like well this person isn't a fit because they don't have the experience and they haven't communicated that they're looking for that you don't have a conversation with every applicant we only see their resume or their linkedin so you have to somehow communicate um what you want especially if your background isn't 100 a fit because i know that uh curriculum i mean not the curriculum sorry uh the cb or the resume uh i was thinking cv um i know that the real state is limited like you're trying to fit it in one page i've seen people you know really small font not enough spacing they're just trying to cram it all in that one pager so to tell somebody hey by the way besides your relevant experience and your education section and your skill section and maybe your hobbies section throw in there like a couple lines for an objective or a goal like passion or like while you're applying for this and some people might be like really do i really need to like i can't so if but it sounds to me like it's actually important like it can actually make a difference it can't make a difference it's but and i say especially for those who don't have the 100 experience or their experience is hard to navigate uh like you they know their experience and they know their journey but you can't necessarily understand how they went from being a pilot to being a a software developer um and you need you need a sentence to say hey i transition careers and this is what i'm passionate about um uh but i will say most people add too much information on their resume anyway and so probably people who are trying to squeeze the senses in and can't find space they can probably cut out several things that aren't necessary or that we won't look at like sometimes people will have seven bullets under one job and it's like no one's gonna read all that you have seven seconds to communicate your value and we're not gonna be reading all seven bullets under five jobs wait i'm curious now okay okay so let's let's just from jump right into that start telling me about all the horror stories of resumes because i'm sure that there's some lessons learned here i'm sure that this people watching this video now or in the future i'm sure that they can save themselves some pain uh with whatever you know what you've seen what are some of the common mistakes that people make like you just mentioned bullet points okay so if i'm writing my experience and i say you know 2016 to 2019 this job and i write seven eight lines explaining everything i was managing a team of seven or eight reporting to whatever i did this we achieved this goal and we did this one project sounds like that's too much how and what is that i think it falls back does it does it go back to the idea of like what you're trying to communicate what is it that you're trying to tell the recruiter what's the story i guess like is that so is that one of the typical things that you see maybe too much information you said yeah i see i see it all the time too much information i think people confuse uh the section of details on their resume with job description and it's actually not your job description it is your results your accomplishments your achievements um what you're actually like proud of um it's as if you're in you know you are having an elevator pitch and you have two sentences to communicate what you did and how it was great at that job like i think people should phrase it in their heads in that way as opposed to let me write every possible thing just in case this one thing or this one thing catches their eye another thing another way that people go wrong is that um people don't realize how um how complicated they sound on their resume when it's actually it shouldn't be that complicated uh for instance you know uh if i wrote you know well let me not give a specific outfit but sometimes people give too much detail about what they're actually doing when the reader doesn't know their company or doesn't know their actual uh business set up so if if you know if i talk about the specific uh curriculum people that i'm hiring that might be important but if i talk about um you know this person and that part like it's just somehow somewhere you have to find a line between uh the overview and the weeds of your description and you really only need to give an overview you don't need to go into deep description because if the overview doesn't catch their attention then the description won't either and it'll just be a waste of space i feel like um so is it fair to say um i feel like resumes is sort of like the first thing that you're gonna see but like i said before if that interests you as a recruiter then you might set up a phone interview right to learn more about them so like i feel like some people so am i correct in inter in understanding that your resume should showcase some of that work enough that it makes the other person interested the person reading it and then they can always call you they can always hang by your phone and then you can explain at length like what you did hey i saw that you have this relevant experience can you talk you know can you tell me more about this role or how you did this right like you're trying i feel like some people write their resumes as they are trying to answer questions in a phone screen interview is that is that what's happening yeah well not necessarily they just try to put as much detail as possible to just cover all bases they're like oh well just in case you want to know about this project i also did this and it does this cool thing and it's relevant to this company this way when that's actually not important we want to know the high level overview and why it was awesome if you could say i was amazing and two to three bullet points that's good um you don't necessarily need more for that um now if you had a job at a company for 10 years and you did a lot of amazing stuff then that's a different story than if you were at a company for two years and you did some amazing stuff but like you did some really amazing stuff we want to know the really great stuff the stuff that you let the stuff that you produce um and that's what that's what gets attention not okay the my new details what about what about the skills section of resume is that a mistake when people write skills teamwork microsoft office uh communication um i mean i'm not saying that it let's not say it's a mistake but um i mean what's the value of that section like if if somebody were to remove it like that's not a section is that a negative against the resume then i think you need the skill section but i do not think that you need to list every skill set you've ever learned in your life i think you need to list the skills that are important for the role that you're applying to so if you're applying for a curriculum role for instance um you need to demonstrate that you have that full stack experience but also that you have teaching experience so you might say both of those things in your skill sets now if you're applying to a marketing role or pr role maybe saying communication could be important but um you know it may not be the most important detail to add on a technical role when we want to know more about which technical skill sets that you have okay and do you know anything about uh i know that some companies do some sort of like prescanning resumes where they're looking for keywords or things like that and i've heard in the past that maybe at the bottom of your resume like you know at the very last line of or something or even even in the margin um add keywords or hashtags or like certain things that will kind of like a computer will pick up that human might not see that's why they say put out at the end um is that in your experience i don't know if your kodakami or another place is that a thing that some people can take advantage of trying to hit more keywords so they get sorted in the system better or um i mean i would say yes in general yes i would say if you could look at the job description of the role that you're applying to and look for exactly the sort of things that they're looking for um i mean i guess you could think of it as looking for keywords but more so just actually look and read what they're looking for and if that matches to what you're doing let's say you use a word like communication instead of public relations and you can replace those words and that would help you then that that's fine but i wouldn't go adding things that you actually don't have experience with just to increase your level of keywords because you still won't be relevant if you if you don't have that experience okay and i mean i guess that also goes into knowing the company you're applying for right i mean some companies have a very automated process right where you submit a resume and like a minute later literally 60 seconds later you get an automated email saying sorry you didn't get a in this role whatever and that wasn't a human being right that was they had like a i don't know how they called it has an acronym like this they call it ats yeah application uh tracking systems yeah yeah so i know that sometimes so i guess that's that's also part of like doing your due diligence when you're applying for a company okay uh this company has this sort of systems so i need to make sure that i i pass the hurdle first right um and do what i have to do um that's pretty cool do you have any other like examples of things not to do in a resume that seems to be very common or like people should avoid is there anything that you come across a lot um i i think you know sometimes people put their entire addresses on a resume and that's not necessary it's actually a safety concern you should probably just put you know this you want to disclose your location which you don't have to do you could just put the city and the state or the city in the country you don't have to put your entire address or po box because no one's actually mailing you anything that's a that's something they did in the past not now we're going to email you um i think another thing is just being really wild with with templates uh okay this can be very fun um and they don't have to be you know black and white straight up and down you can add color and even add a picture if you want if that makes you feel good uh but i think sometimes i see really well templates that i'm like this is actually too far especially in technical resumes because they try to you know do whatever they can to explain express their you know design um abilities um and i would still make it readable still make it you know similar to a resume and i would even do an approved template uh just to be safe but if you wanted to design your own template i would just make sure that it's still very professional um and that it fits the the the brand of the company that you're applying to so if you're applying to code academy um yeah we're fun but we're also you know a company that cares worked on it yeah every company that cares about clarity um and you know communication that is pretty professional so i would i would still take it seriously i think uh you know that that's actually a great segue for another question i had to for you that was about templates um google does this thing called uh grow with google or something like that it's like this kind of like one hour mini courses that they do offer online on demand um and i actually attended one for resumes and stuff and the first thing that they tell you is go to your google drive and create a new uh wrestling template and i'm curious to know templating seems to be one of those things where if everybody does it then the recruiter is going to be trained to recognize that design and it might actually give you an advantage because the developer knows where the experience section is where the skill section is because you've seen that template a thousand times so it's kind of like so it might give you an advantage in that sense that makes it easier to read for the for the recovery because they've seen it before but at the same time sometimes people will say well it's it's a template so you're not showing any interest real like this is like a copy and paste from the other 100 places you apply so some recruiters might look at them be like well this is a template which means that they don't care they didn't put enough effort into this do do you have you seen that in the past that how templating can go both ways i i can understand how that could be the case but like i said at cogatomi we don't we don't uh reject candidates based off things like that are a bit more trivial like their template now if they have a bunch of typos in their resume like that's not a good sign but if you generally have the experiences and you use a basic template i'm not going to be like oh this person's using didn't care about doing a different template i'm going to say this person has experiences i want to hire them so i don't think that i think that template and the style and the format that you present your resume and as long as it's professional the actual decoration of it uh is probably less than five percent of the importance of getting you across that you know to the next step but i i think your experience will be 90 of what's relevant okay great uh and i know that uh you also mentioned this uh with the address saying nobody send you letters anymore so modern day restroom is is it is it more common place now for applicants especially for technical roles to include uh urls uh to their linkedin profile or their github repo things like that is is that more commonplace now or like at the top right under your name or something that is like links to pages is it like normal now like no vacuum is gonna scoff at that or be like this is poor taste or something yeah i think i think it's really um it's really common and in my experience it's actually pretty helpful if someone links their linkedin and doesn't just like because some people would just put the html uh like the whole web address uh which is fine as well i could copy and paste but if someone links their linkedin i'm gonna much easier click on that and go to it then i would copy and paste someone's uh the same thing with their projects and with their personal website so but i don't think it's a it's not a necessary component like if i if you were really a great candidate and i wanted to go look at your website or your projects i will copy and paste the link or google it uh but it's helpful if you have those links and obviously uh this is with the caveat that we're in the us and there's people watching from all over the world like i know in some countries they expect you to include profile pictures for example where in the u.s we don't uh so obviously uh for everybody watching remember that um what we were talking about is kind of like u.s centric a little bit that might be different in the country there in and maybe maybe including links to your github repo it's bad taste in the country living so just keep that in mind uh you know you have to play by the rules of where you live um you know we actually touched on a lot of things i don't know if you wanna if you wanna offer any sort of general advice or we can go straight into q a um the last thing i would say is generally i think uh linkedin's can be a bit touchy and or maybe you know someone may not put as much energy into their linkedin as they with their resume and i would say it's still important even though they serve different capacities and they're they're not necessarily interchangeable they're still both individually important and it should be individually strong nice yeah and i think uh it's something that people don't wanna they don't like but it's still the rules of the game sort of uh when they say hey make sure that the photo in your profile photo in linkedin is like not blurry that you look normal yeah like whatever it's kind of like well that shouldn't matter who i am what i know it's like i know i know but someone that doesn't know you is still going to look at that photo and their brain is going to make a judgment call out of that and and i know it's terrible and you don't want to be judged on like you were wearing tshirt and flipflops in the beach but at the end of the day you're trying to get a job and if yeah you know so there's little details like that on linkedin like you said uh sometimes people don't put effort on linkedin and it might make a difference even if you don't think that's important it's not about what you think it's about what the recruiters think right yeah especially if you're trying to get into web development or something that is you know front end facing we want to know that you have like a solid uh understanding of how to you know navigate something like a linkedin profile which is on the web you know so you're lying in a linkedin profile and it's like the gray figurehead like there's no photo or anything like oh no i mean i would like again we wouldn't reject someone because of it but it would i mean i the photo i'm not really big on is the rest of the profile like you know what i don't have a banner either there's no banner image there's no profile well you know how we see their bio is one line i like what about like one i mean that wouldn't be a bad thing if they had details under their jobs or if they had skills that they listed um or if they had a link to their website but just having nothing um and just a couple of jobs and it's outdated and we don't know if you're still there that's when it's like okay can this person be a web developer because they don't even uh update their linkedin i feel like um you know what it's kind of one of those things instead of thinking of like um there's two ways i think of thinking like this um you start with 100 points and you lose points every time you make a mistake that's one way of thinking about this i think recruiting the way that you're saying like well a photo is not going to make me reject somebody i feel like it's the other way around you start at zero points and you're trying to add points to your account to the point where the recruiter wants to talk to you in a phone interview or a technical interview so oh you don't have a profile photo okay well that's plus zero like you you didn't gain you didn't lose oh you then put a good bio in your linkedin well that's not a negative but it's not a positive and if we have a hundred applicants for this maybe the other ones did a better job than you did right so that's exactly it's kind of like it's like a basketball game or like any sports game like you're just adding points to your scoreboard so i think you're right i think you're right about that so like yeah you're not gonna get rejected but you might not get chosen either just because you didn't you know spend an hour one afternoon making your linkedin more polished uh polished yeah um cool let's go uh let's go for some q a here um yeah so at the end of every live stream everyone watching we always do some q a and i'm gonna go through the chat looking at what people were asking let's see if i can find some questions somebody was wondering about transitioning from different kinds of career what should they put in terms of the past jobs okay so i think this question is more about um when you have experience but it's in a different field do you is there any way is any particular where like better than way of highlighting experience that might be relevant for the job but it's not in the field that you're applying for um i think what i i i think what i would not do is lie about the previous jobs or uh change the previous jobs in a way to make it seem like you are always doing this thing i wouldn't do that like less like if you were a librarian and now you're transitioning into engineering you put on your resume all previous librarian jobs everything i did had to do i t like i wouldn't do that because it doesn't actually serve serve you i think i think the best thing you could do is um be short and be honest about what you did um and like i said before add in a cover letter and an objective that says i'm pivoting careers i'm excited about this i'm passionate for the next steps and this is the work that i've done to get towards that next career but i think it depends on the years of experience that you have in that previous career uh like if you have 10 years of experience as a chef before you went into engineering i wouldn't put every job you had i would put maybe one or two jobs let's say if you had one job for a long period of time that job and then maybe just put chef various companies uh x amount of years or let's say you only did it for four years um that you were a chef before you transitioned then i would just put you know chef various companies list the companies list some of the roles that you did but i wouldn't add all the details and all of the examples that you add under your engineering projects because if you do that then it may take up too much visual space and you need that visual space to demonstrate your interest and to talk about your projects and so i mean if you if you spend 70 percent of your visual resume space talking about your previous industry then we will assume that you are you know not fully transitioned versus if you spend 70 percent of time talking about the engineering role that you're going after then it'll be like okay well they're transitioning they have projects now um they have things to talk about okay cool yeah so focus on the goal yeah uh i know that uh other oh people have talked to uh mentioned something similar which is only mention the bars that are relevant for the role so like oh okay you were a chef and you were you had like three shoe chefs under you or you had like these people whatever oh you've been managing inventory for the uh for the kitchen the wine like yeah if you're applying for a role where you can highlight your communication skills or your team leadership skills or whatever like cool mention that like there's nothing wrong with that yeah it's a different industry but people are people like it's just you know so i know that um that tends to be kind of like don't be ashamed that you weren't working in the job that you were you're applying for that's why you're applying for the job be sincere with the job experience you had and just highlight the parts that are relevant i guess yeah right i would agree yeah yeah uh let's see other questions be honest and be myself yeah yeah very much uh these users are saying yeah that's uh that's what we just said let's just be honest um because at the end of the day you don't want to work at a place that doesn't want you to be honest anyways right like that that's just that's also from your perspective as a candidate you you want to work at a place that that also nurtures that kind of mentality what about the fresh news okay so somebody some people are wondering about college degrees versus selfmade portfolios and they're wondering if there's like one that is better than the other or if they go handinhand or like so i get obviously every company is gonna be different here at code academy i'm assuming that we don't really put a preference in like if you have a degree or not like i guess it depends on the role that we're looking for i would actually be interested and i would i'd be interested in the stats of how many people echo academy came through like self learning or boot camp or some alternative education method versus uh like cs or data science degree i i i would think maybe it would lean a little bit more towards degree but it would probably be like 60 40. um i don't think that well i know for sure that it's not that it's not necessary to have a degree um it's about whether or not you can do the work and you have the experience to showcase that you've done the work so if you have if you've been selflearning like the first example i gave was of the pilot himself learned through coke academy for the past year he had experiences he had projects he had links and certificates he he demonstrated that he was doing the work if you can demonstrate that you know how to do the work that's what we care about if you get interview you know what you're talking about and you could pass a technical assessment that's what matters not because someone who you know has a degree you know may not necessarily be so familiar with those concepts that they could pass a technical assessment or they may not be the best at that so i would say really just focus on demonstrating your experiences and that's what matters more mileage may vary uh or kilometer may vary depending on where you are in the world uh metric system um i have i actually have a great example for this something i learned last week that is one of our administrators one of the admins on our discord community he's been selfteaching himself code for the past year and a half or something and he actually landed a job prepandemic but because the pandemic came around the lockdowns he that that offer got rescinded uh so he spent a year keep teaching himself and this person didn't actually have a portfolio like they just they collaborated with so many open source projects online and they collaborated with so many people and they connected with so many that that developers in companies were like dude are you working somewhere no you're what that's so and they started giving him referrals like hey i'm gonna put you in contact with my recruiting group and like you know people like we need people like you and like so so it just kind of like happened for him he was just like getting online and you know working on projects and it was very typical yeah not the typical like i have my three pro projects here i'm gonna start applying it was more like people saying why aren't you working yet and yeah and kind of like so i think that goes that goes kind of like that idea of companies look for different places different people and different backgrounds and some job descriptions will say straight out bachelor's degree require and others will not and if they don't they don't like that's just right like don't worry about it yeah yeah agreed i did have a candidate who who we hired who for a subject matter expert role and i he did not have a degree but he worked on a bunch of different things he had so much experience and the most the most great thing about his experience was that he had uh like completely he had like done so many open source projects that he was like running the open source board for for one particular field and it was just sort of like we don't it's no it's no option like because we have to hire this person because he knows exactly what he's talking about i'm pretty sure he built this this software like not even for a junior role yeah it was for like a part time yeah so i'm like yeah it's about the experiences yeah definitely so yeah i would encourage anyone watching this not don't get caught up in like the traditional uh divisions of like college degree not college degree things like that uh that's changing especially in tech uh that's changing a lot it's shifting um and in fact uh platforms like code academy they're so valuable for that for that specific reason because more and more companies are realizing you know college degrees are great but you can learn the stuff someplace else and that's why they're boot camps and there's all these places um let's see someone is asking about job gaps so how do you deal with what if you had a job then a couple years went by and then you have no jobs um is there any way of like i don't know how to embellish that in the resume or like yeah what is that is that something that yeah is that a red flag for a recruit like you're looking at up down seven seconds and you see 2021 to 2019 and then 2017. is this something you go whoa what happened um uh i mean i think it's very common that people have job gaps so i i don't think that it is weird um i think people would like recruiters would probably ask you about it like hey and notice that this time was uh if you don't say it in your cover letter or your objective um or if you don't say it on the resume um they might ask you about it just to clarify that it wasn't something that you take that you took out of your resume and it was a job gap um i've seen some really clever things that people have done especially on linkedin like i saw one person had on their linkedin traveling world 2019 to 2020 and then they were like you know then they have their new job 2021 after that and it was just sort of like okay um and you know i'm not mad at you for traveling i think um if you can be honest about that and i think i think you anyone who has those sort of gaps wants their employer to to be able to um allow them to do that or just you know see them as a human being and so i don't think that you have to shy away from that i think we're in an age where you can really be honest about it or just leave it off and say i wasn't working and then i started back here um you know my stepmom is one who stepped away from from work for like six years to raise um babies and so that's a like that's a lot of years in terms of her management experience but she still has all these years of experience and i was just helping her write her resume and she was like you know how do i do i even address it do i say anything i was like no just just skip it don't say anything if you if you want to say raising family you can but i don't think you have to give them that much information you could just skip it and put you know whatever let's say you've been doing volunteer experience during that time or um you took taking a class during that time just put that information and just focus on um what you have to give as opposed to drawing too much attention if you don't want to yeah okay yeah so again be sincere but yeah get creative i guess you can be a little creative like doing classes volunteering work traveling i guess enjoying your life building a family uh i know that that's a big one uh facebook had a program a few years ago that was something like reengaging the force either i forget the name of the initiative but they were basically looking for people specifically with job with job gaps with gaps in their timelines where they were like these are the people that want to help uh you know get jobs on facebook and stuff because you know we believe that that's not a burden that's not a negative um someone had a question earlier during our conversation about formatting cover letters and i don't know if you do resumes and cover letters like i guess you do a bit of everything is there like a typical structure for cover letters that seems to work better like i think that it's like a intro yourself second paragraph it's about your experience and third paragraph is you fit in the company things like that like there's like a one two three like is there like a recipe for this i there probably is uh my favorite type of cover letter is one paragraph real quick one paragraph cover letter it is simple it is concise it isn't some people in the cover letters they'll tell you the company's mission statement they'll take the company's values they'll talk about their 20 years of experience and they'll repeat what's on their resume well that's actually not what i'm looking for i'm looking for how you fit for this job and that doesn't mean elaborate on every job that you had that means give me high level why you're in why you're a fit for this job um and yeah letters don't have to be a letter it sounds to me like it doesn't have to be a whole 500 500 word page well the thing is that people take it and they will write three pages of a cover letter or they'll oh wow or they'll make the font size 9.5 and expand the margins and they'll put so much information in one page and it's just like no one is re like we don't want to read all that we want to read concise information that explains exactly how you're fit for this job we know that you're passionate we know that you're interested we want to know why you're fit um and so that that that's the important part of cover letters you know talking about getting creative with gaps so if you had a gap in 2020 because of the pandemic could you just do you think that would be totally fine for somebody to be like 20 20 pandemic it's just like i lost my job it's it's it is what it is i've seen it i've seen uh they'll put during they'll put in in parentheses um left you know out of work due to covert layoffs or i've i've also seen uh people just say um you know pandemic family leave like people will be very open and honest about you know things and i don't think it's a bad thing i think we on the other side of that paper really understand okay i was there too i know how it felt like i know people were doing all types of things and there's no judgment at least at cocademy now other companies i'm not sure how they'll judge people but i'm sure that people are just as human as we are um and they will try to give you the benefit of the doubt all right you heard it here before i mean first uh before i'm first uh okay last question uh somebody's wondering about the language and resumes and they're thinking about there's like a passive tone an active tone um another different ways that you can portray information in the resume um is there any way that you recommend is there anything that that tends to be the norm or kind of like the the rule of thumb for writing resumes um active versus passive i think the rule of thumb is definitely active language uh i'm trying to think exactly what that looks like and i can't really pinpoint it but i know that uh the main thing of resumes is that you just want to get to the point as quickly as possible and passive language sort of takes you on a little bit of a journey to get there so if you can you know say teacher talk kids wrote assignments did this like just be very concise and very poignant about what you're saying uh then i i wouldn't i wouldn't spend too much time on the other details okay yeah i think we just keep coming back to this idea of like there's limited time and yeah real estate for a recruiter they're gonna look at it for so many seconds and their eyes can only look at so many words so don't go in circles don't do anything weird just just say this is who i am and this is what i know exactly and the recruiter will give you a thumbs up no problem okay well it's been awesome uh i think i learned a lot i'm walking out of this uh feeling like i'm ready to apply for jobs maybe okay i'm glad that we got to answer some questions from the audience um we do this every week guys by the way so next week we're going to have somebody else online live answering questions another recruiter from code academy so just stop by just keep checking our kodakami youtube channel and i'll catch you in the next ones thank you so much gemini uh any parting thoughts uh no i'm excited to see resumes all clean and concise out there in the world all right being concise thank you so much everybody goodbye thank you and that's the stream
