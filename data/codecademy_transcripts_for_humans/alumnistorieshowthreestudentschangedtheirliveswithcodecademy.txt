00:02 - three years ago I was gonna drop that I
00:04 - did not like I wasn't enjoying it I
00:06 - didn't really feel like I was going
00:07 - anywhere and I always wanted to work as
00:10 - a creative lots of places had it on
00:12 - their list of desirable things if you
00:14 - wanted to work as a creative people
00:16 - would like you to have HTML skills or
00:18 - some CSS skills so I thought well well I
00:20 - like take a couple of courses started
00:23 - out after college working as a IT
00:25 - specialist for about five years and then
00:28 - started to kind of have the itch to
00:30 - learn something new and start to teach
00:33 - myself to code
00:33 - I was just consuming a lot of things
00:35 - that other people have made so there's
00:37 - this feeling of wanting to actually
00:38 - build something in my own when your day
00:41 - to day is talking with folks who have
00:42 - been coding and engineering for 20 years
00:45 - it's pretty intimidating you start to
00:48 - look for ways to shore that up and to
00:50 - stand out in fact I made it my new
00:52 - year's resolution learn our code after
00:55 - that the forces I started trying to
00:57 - apply it stuff so I'd like one little
00:58 - tiny project of my own and I found it
01:01 - quite rewarding and I was like this is
01:02 - something I'm actually really enjoying
01:03 - doing wouldn't this be really good if I
01:05 - could do this all the time I can get
01:07 - paid for it I applied for an internship
01:09 - in New York and I got it so I spent a
01:12 - year in New York working as a developer
01:14 - for Citibank I didn't really have
01:16 - anything to properly show literally all
01:19 - I had was but I would say I took these
01:21 - characters resources and that is how I
01:24 - got the job I think the first time that
01:27 - it really clicked and I thought I was
01:29 - getting it was gonna go into the lessons
01:31 - and thinking okay and they just taught
01:33 - me how to randomize
01:34 - the things and I thought okay if I could
01:37 - do that there's something in my own life
01:38 - for me at the time it was picking out
01:39 - some exercises that I wanted it to do
01:41 - but not having the same ones every time
01:43 - I could actually take when I was exactly
01:45 - learning in that lesson do something on
01:47 - my own with it and then let me put it
01:50 - out there into the App Store's and see
01:51 - what happens just see if other people
01:53 - want to use it knowing how to code has
01:56 - got me off the sidelines and I got
01:57 - promoted and it happened at the end of
01:59 - the year so I was able to basically look
02:02 - back at my new year's resolution and say
02:04 - man that definitely paid off and I'm
02:06 - currently the found in the CEO of my own
02:08 - syrup are you protect me to learn for
02:11 - free people paying like thousands and
02:13 - thousands of pounds for university
02:14 - degree in some kind of computer science
02:16 - and I didn't and I still have a proper
02:18 - job I'm a proper developer sore could
02:20 - start off as a side project that was the
02:22 - first time you know I've started a
02:24 - project that actually clicked I think I
02:26 - got lucky on the first try at this point
02:28 - now we've helped over 25 million people
02:30 - work out
02:31 - that's great feeling
02:33 - [Music]
