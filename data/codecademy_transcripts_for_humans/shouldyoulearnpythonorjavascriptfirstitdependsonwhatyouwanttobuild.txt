00:00 - how do you feel about JavaScript versus
00:02 - python I know that a lot of people ask
00:04 - well which one should I go for first
00:05 - yeah it's a great question and as a CS
00:08 - educator it's one I personally go back
00:10 - and forth on
00:12 - um python is an extremely powerful
00:13 - program that's similar to JavaScript has
00:16 - a lot of different applications
00:18 - um and it's not surprising that pythons
00:20 - are first most popular course in
00:22 - JavaScript is our second one so you know
00:24 - with python you can get into data
00:26 - science applications if you're really
00:28 - excited about AI I would definitely
00:29 - recommend Python and then if you are
00:32 - interested in very creative applications
00:34 - or doing more web development web design
00:35 - I think JavaScript is for you and the
00:38 - great thing is honestly is you can learn
00:40 - both like when I was learning how to
00:42 - program I started with JavaScript and
00:44 - then I took a python class and what I
00:47 - found is that learning a second language
00:49 - really helped ground me in the basic
00:52 - principles of
00:54 - you know programming topics say pick one
00:56 - language python or JavaScript and then
00:58 - you can always come back to the second
00:59 - one
