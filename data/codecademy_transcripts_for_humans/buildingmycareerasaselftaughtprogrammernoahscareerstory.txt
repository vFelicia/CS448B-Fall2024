00:28 - myself I went with code academy because
00:29 - I liked the way that it keeps track of
00:31 - everything that you're learning
00:33 - everything's laid out in a very
00:35 - intuitive way all of the tools that you

00:39 - documentation they're all in one place
00:40 - so everything's really easy to find code
00:42 - academy is like a a very accelerated way
00:45 - to get through the basics and then you
00:46 - can kind of learn the peripheral stuff
00:48 - being able to go from no knowledge at
00:50 - all to having a job within a year it was
00:53 - a really big achievement for me today
00:55 - I'm working as a full stack web
