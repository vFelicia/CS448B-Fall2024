00:01 - all right
00:02 - hi everyone and welcome my name is laura
00:04 - i'm the chapter lead for academy seoul
00:07 - here in south korea
00:08 - and i'm here today with danny who is
00:10 - going to talk to us about linux
00:13 - and the way this is going to work danny
00:16 - has put together a presentation
00:18 - for us which is going to take 30 35
00:21 - minutes
00:23 - after which we'll be taking questions
00:25 - from the audience so
00:27 - if you do have any questions please post
00:29 - them in the live chat and we'll do our
00:31 - best to answer them
00:34 - running over to you if you could please
00:36 - introduce yourself
00:41 - um
00:42 - right do it okay hi i'm dan um oh um i'm
00:48 - a
00:49 - uh i live in the uk uh based in london
00:51 - uh i'm a data engineer uh by profession
00:55 - uh and i've been doing this for about
00:58 - 13-15 years
00:59 - so
01:01 - so i'm quite honored to be happy to have
01:04 - you given this opportunity to be here to
01:06 - tell you a few things about uh about
01:08 - this topic on why do you developers
01:10 - prefer
01:11 - linux
01:14 - let's get started
01:18 - i'm just going to pull out screen share
01:20 - and launch
01:27 - so um yep hello um
01:31 - i hope you're all well and safe
01:33 - hopefully uh at the end of this session
01:35 - you will have a couple of things to
01:36 - think about
01:38 - uh in your journey to becoming a
01:40 - developer
01:41 - this is not a technical discussion uh
01:43 - just you have to remind yourself that
01:45 - uh also we'll be taking it easy
01:48 - let's get started
01:50 - if you don't already know linux that's
01:52 - okay i can only guess that you are here
01:54 - because you want to know more about it
01:57 - and how
01:58 - it can benefit you in your projects
02:01 - or at work
02:05 - so
02:07 - choices
02:09 - the image are the images on either sides
02:11 - must be a familiar scenario when you
02:14 - decide on your next brand new computer
02:17 - in my opinion the one on the right is
02:19 - far too expensive
02:21 - so i can safely assume a large majority
02:23 - of us would settle
02:26 - for the one on the left however many
02:28 - developers i've come across have
02:30 - expressed their preference for the mac
02:33 - for development and i'm here to shed
02:36 - some light on the on why you should be
02:38 - aware of not one but both systems
02:42 - especially in the context of development
02:45 - well the penguin is in between the two
02:49 - but it doesn't exist in either machine
02:51 - you have to go and get it
02:57 - hello uh again just brief introduction
03:00 - um i'm dan
03:02 - and i've been teaching myself how to
03:03 - code and i've been involved in numerous
03:06 - projects building applications software
03:08 - developments and data solutions for the
03:11 - past 13 years i have worked with within
03:14 - the windows linux
03:16 - and the mac os
03:17 - i deal mainly with data in my world this
03:21 - is the etl specialist
03:23 - but it is now more glamorous to be known
03:26 - as
03:28 - data engineer so that's who and what i
03:30 - am
03:36 - chances are that the large majority of
03:38 - you here on the windows operating system
03:41 - you may have been using it for a while
03:43 - and may be comfortable making system
03:45 - changes but on a minimal scale
03:48 - to be safe
03:50 - if you're not
03:51 - that's uh that's absolutely fine as well
03:54 - i'm not here to call you on that
03:56 - and for
03:57 - the
03:58 - more advanced audience if you are here
04:01 - did you know that you can practically
04:03 - navigate windows using just a keyboard
04:06 - forget the mouse
04:08 - can you believe it
04:10 - using windows without the mouse
04:12 - that would be quite an experience
04:14 - there was a time the unthinkable
04:16 - happened my fear of wireless pointing
04:19 - device and mouse had a heart attack
04:23 - i was on windows
04:25 - and i was completely paralyzed i was
04:27 - unable to complete even the most basic
04:30 - task of browsing the internet for
04:32 - technical help
04:35 - it was then i discovered keyboard
04:37 - shortcuts i never knew
04:40 - and in retrospect i was convinced to
04:42 - this day that the mouse can be made
04:44 - redundant
04:46 - most of the time
04:47 - but for a better user experience
04:50 - you know what to do
04:51 - keep it
04:52 - and make sure it's still alive
04:59 - so how is this short story any relevant
05:03 - to this topic
05:05 - well again i have worked on you a number
05:07 - of interesting data projects depending
05:09 - on the project i found myself switching
05:11 - between operating systems
05:13 - like
05:14 - the sales events
05:17 - and i have found it particularly
05:19 - interesting as it is important to know
05:21 - exactly what must be done to set up a
05:24 - viable development environment on my
05:27 - machine
05:28 - and be ready to adapt
05:30 - i'd like to point out here that
05:32 - knowing your os means knowing how to set
05:35 - up your development environment this
05:38 - means configuring applications open
05:41 - source tools text editors which are easy
05:44 - and straightforward most of the time
05:47 - this includes applications that you
05:49 - already know
05:51 - as well as the ones you don't
05:53 - because some companies have their own
05:55 - list of approved softwares that can be
05:59 - installed onto your
06:00 - to your machine that can only be
06:02 - installed onto your machine
06:04 - this is typically big companies
06:08 - however
06:09 - doing them right at the start will save
06:12 - you from future headaches and mess
06:15 - that's the difference
06:16 - just like the dance
06:18 - if you were pulled out to the dance
06:20 - floor and it was your first time to
06:23 - salsa or or dance of any kind
06:27 - you will be
06:28 - like stiff frozen and may not even feel
06:31 - the lens
06:33 - at all
06:34 - i felt the same paralysis
06:36 - in a sense of not knowing what to do
06:38 - when i had to start a project on a
06:41 - provisioned macbook
06:43 - it was my first
06:45 - you see working in the it in the uk you
06:48 - are usually alone
06:50 - um a machine when you join a company so
06:53 - you never know what you're gonna get
06:56 - that's not a quote from
06:58 - uh
07:00 - what's that tom hanks a movie i can't
07:02 - remember what it's like
07:04 - anyway
07:05 - i don't know what it's like in other
07:07 - parts of the world but perhaps one of
07:09 - you can tell me at the end of this
07:10 - session i'll be very curious to know
07:16 - so
07:17 - with that it took me quite a while to
07:19 - get used to the new os let alone setting
07:22 - up
07:23 - after some time i can say that i have
07:25 - had a positive experience because of my
07:28 - familiarity with linux
07:30 - personally i think it wasn't just about
07:33 - the macbook or linux
07:35 - but more on customization in other words
07:38 - hackability
07:40 - you see
07:42 - i have seen first hand
07:44 - power developers move blocks of codes
07:47 - copy paste it search and replace text
07:50 - then jumps from line 35 to 1287
07:55 - to insert a function and does the same
07:58 - thing all over again in different places
08:00 - save the changes and immediately
08:03 - in another active terminal session the
08:06 - unit testing for that script kicks off
08:08 - when that task pass
08:11 - in just a few more keystrokes the code
08:13 - has been committed and pushed to his
08:16 - github repository
08:17 - all in the flash
08:19 - boom
08:20 - the party was over within a minute or
08:22 - what felt like a minute the mouse wasn't
08:24 - even there
08:26 - or was it not even involved
08:28 - it was fascinating to watch and behind
08:31 - the scenes all of that was made possible
08:34 - because of customization
08:36 - i was like whoa
08:39 - that's productivity over the roof
08:42 - that was unbelievable truly
08:45 - the one thing that both the mac elements
08:47 - have in common is the terminal this is
08:50 - where you run bash commands among other
08:53 - things depending on the specialization
08:56 - or your specialization the developer can
08:58 - spend up to 65 percent
09:00 - of their time
09:02 - within the terminal if not more
09:05 - when when you can hack your system and
09:07 - benefit your will so to speak
09:10 - you will see your productivity improve
09:13 - just like that
09:15 - developer
09:16 - this includes automating some mundane
09:19 - tasks creating
09:21 - terminal shortcuts aliases functions
09:23 - scripting up pre-loaded environment and
09:26 - many more
09:28 - that guy had everything under his
09:30 - control
09:31 - it's like magic
09:34 - for an average user when you look at him
09:36 - you will not you will not even have a
09:38 - clue what what just happened
09:42 - but if you were to peel it under the
09:43 - under the
09:45 - the layers if you were to examine there
09:47 - were many things that have been
09:49 - automated
09:51 - what this means that it means that many
09:53 - keystrokes can be saved which means it
09:56 - will save you time which means more time
09:59 - for you to focus on what's more
10:01 - important and solutionizing them which
10:04 - means your delivery cadence goes up
10:07 - [Music]
10:09 - there are many native tools or small
10:11 - applications
10:12 - in which are simple to use
10:15 - customizable and i dare say powerful
10:19 - they are the command line applications
10:22 - that we have come to to know and love
10:25 - i am referring to tools
10:28 - like the one listed
10:30 - here not find which man
10:34 - kill cat but actually each of these is a
10:36 - key word
10:37 - for an application
10:39 - i just just arrange them intentionally
10:42 - to
10:43 - you
10:44 - know yeah so just like this one's here i
10:47 - said
10:48 - all of which the most seasoned
10:50 - developers know of and have exploited
10:52 - and the beautiful thing about all these
10:54 - tools is that they can be chained
10:56 - together for sequential
10:58 - execution
10:59 - only one line
11:01 - if you want to you can create your own
11:03 - simple application this way to automate
11:06 - certain things
11:08 - just to mention quickly the mac os is
11:11 - based on the bsd code base which is
11:14 - unique
11:15 - it is similar to the linux system
11:18 - however they are not binary compatible
11:21 - okay
11:22 - so because of the similarities between
11:25 - the unix and the linux distros or the
11:28 - linux
11:29 - in other words the mac os and the linux
11:31 - distros these tools are widely available
11:34 - in both operating system
11:36 - and when i say linux here
11:39 - excuse me i'm also indirectly referring
11:42 - to the mac
11:44 - so
11:46 - as mentioned you can customize your
11:49 - environment using property files dot
11:52 - files system and local environment paths
11:55 - as well as creating environment
11:56 - functions to boost productivity and to
12:00 - automate certain repetitive tasks
12:03 - there are documentation as well on how
12:05 - to use each of these
12:07 - these tools from the terminal if you
12:10 - just need to be reminded
12:15 - just to highlight other favorites
12:18 - on the mac you can add new workspaces
12:21 - and swipe sideways to them this allows
12:23 - you to better organize your open
12:26 - applications and helps you focus on your
12:29 - thoughts depending on which workspace
12:31 - you are in
12:32 - so
12:33 - emails for me emails and messaging in
12:36 - one space text editors encoding
12:39 - application in another space the web
12:41 - browser
12:43 - in the other space
12:46 - depending on how you want to organize it
12:48 - yeah so similarly you can find multiple
12:51 - virtual desktop environments in linux as
12:54 - well
12:55 - depending on the chosen desktop
12:56 - environment when you install it
12:59 - such as the pde
13:02 - no
13:04 - and others
13:05 - oh there's also launching application
13:08 - like typing it out
13:09 - i think this didn't happen until windows
13:11 - 7.
13:12 - thanks to development in linux distro
13:14 - and mac os
13:17 - and
13:18 - last but not least the availability and
13:21 - accessibility of numerous open source
13:23 - softwares at the touch of your
13:25 - fingertips
13:26 - just key into just key them into the
13:28 - terminal
13:29 - you get it
13:31 - no end user license agreement buttons to
13:35 - read and click anymore
13:37 - it must have been ages ago since i last
13:40 - saw eula
13:41 - she wasn't nice
13:42 - it was always her way or the highway
13:46 - if you're like me
13:48 - if you're like me stuck on it on a
13:50 - technical problem i'll consult stack
13:52 - overflow or at least if uh type that
13:55 - i'll type that out in a search engine
13:58 - uh
13:58 - most of the time the stack overflow
14:00 - result will come up to the top is where
14:02 - we all go to again depending on the
14:04 - problem you're trying to solve in my
14:06 - area of expertise
14:08 - those uh those responses are almost
14:11 - always going to be a command line
14:13 - explanation
14:14 - they are a more direct resolution just
14:17 - as a doctor would prescribe a drug for
14:19 - your ailment
14:21 - so
14:22 - windows has not really been a popular
14:25 - has not really been popular among
14:26 - developers it has a reputation of being
14:29 - unstable and unreliable
14:31 - now emphasis here is that this may no
14:34 - longer be the case but its stained
14:36 - reputation has remained stubborn to come
14:39 - off the mind
14:41 - don't get me wrong because i am also
14:43 - aware and know of developers developing
14:45 - only within the windows ecosystem and
14:49 - will raise a finger at linux and the mac
14:55 - so
14:56 - which linux you may ask
14:59 - can i install linux
15:04 - no because there isn't a linux os to
15:06 - install but you can choose a linux
15:08 - distribution for installation
15:11 - for example
15:13 - there are at least seven categories and
15:16 - hundreds of digitals
15:18 - available to be had
15:19 - i will not discuss them here just take a
15:22 - look
15:23 - all free and available
15:25 - except for the red hat and some of its
15:27 - variant
15:32 - if you look at this is a slackware um
15:35 - category
15:36 - and it's got like
15:38 - i don't know 10 so at least 50 of them
15:42 - it is arranged by timeline from 1992 to
15:46 - today
15:47 - and the line extends beyond 2018 which
15:49 - means they're still available here
15:52 - the debian
15:54 - stack
15:56 - variant
15:57 - has got a lot of this uh
15:59 - distros
16:00 - and each of them if you go to your
16:02 - website you can download and install
16:04 - them
16:05 - yeah
16:07 - okay
16:13 - so what i want to say here is this
16:16 - over the decades i noticed the shift
16:19 - towards adaptations or limits like
16:21 - features on windows
16:23 - i believe this was not just a strategic
16:26 - move to recapture some developers they
16:29 - may have lost over time in terms of
16:31 - market share
16:32 - but
16:33 - more on the point of
16:35 - recognition on the fact that linux is
16:37 - more efficient by comparison
16:40 - i do not hope to see my windows get
16:43 - thrown eggs and tomatoes for making this
16:45 - stigma
16:46 - but anyway
16:48 - it really depends
16:49 - on the need and requirements for the
16:51 - project if i'm honest
16:53 - then it means most of the time
16:56 - so
16:57 - what does it mean for you
16:59 - what are leaners like features
17:01 - the ones that immediately comes to mind
17:04 - are launching your applications by
17:05 - typing them out after pressing the
17:07 - windows key
17:11 - recent additions
17:12 - of the windows subsystem for linux
17:15 - that you didn't know this
17:17 - then there's the terminal specifically
17:19 - powershell
17:21 - not the cmd which is dos
17:23 - multiple desktop workspaces like those
17:26 - on the mac machines this was since
17:29 - windows 10
17:30 - or six years ago
17:34 - um and then there's this free for all
17:35 - package management you know like on the
17:38 - mac you can get the home brew which is
17:39 - free it says uh
17:42 - the sort of the home brew to access most
17:45 - open source applications if not all
17:48 - so oh by the way there are a lot of
17:51 - things
17:53 - that can be done or actually are done
17:55 - and achieved through the terminal
17:58 - it's a very important uh feature for
18:01 - within linux
18:03 - so like i said uh
18:05 - these are the similarities okay and just
18:08 - to remind ourselves this is a
18:09 - non-technical also keeping their normal
18:11 - technicals and these are all high level
18:13 - similarities
18:16 - so
18:17 - how do you get into it how do you get
18:19 - started if you haven't already
18:22 - you can run it on virtualbox or vmware
18:25 - download the distro's image and load it
18:27 - up in there
18:28 - it's a non-destructive way of having
18:30 - another os virtualized within windows
18:34 - when you are more comfortable with linux
18:36 - and have found yourself spending more
18:38 - time with open source projects
18:41 - or just wants to hack
18:42 - consider dual booting you can always
18:45 - boot back
18:46 - to windows
18:48 - or boot windows out completely
18:51 - and just put a linux distro in it or two
18:55 - or five if you want
18:58 - or get a macbook if you can afford it
19:02 - and please do not install windows that
19:05 - i shall not say it's a dumb thing to do
19:08 - nope i haven't said it
19:10 - ubuntu is widely supported and has a
19:13 - strong community base there
19:16 - it is one of the most popular linux
19:18 - desktop distro out there so you can
19:20 - start looking over there
19:23 - i'm not here to convince you to ditch
19:24 - windows entirely no
19:27 - but rather question on how fast you can
19:30 - adapt and switch without loss of
19:32 - productivity if or when situation
19:35 - changes but you're not familiar with
19:38 - that situation
19:39 - or
19:40 - if the project that you are interested
19:42 - in
19:43 - is of an open source collaborative
19:46 - but you don't have the proper
19:48 - environment
19:49 - or if your production environment is not
19:52 - a windows ecosystem and you have
19:55 - problems deploying to it because your
19:57 - windows your machine is windows
20:00 - what would you do
20:02 - you can certainly resist change and
20:04 - insist on the one thing that you're
20:06 - already familiar with
20:09 - there is absolutely no problem with that
20:13 - but i want you to be flexible adaptable
20:16 - fluid like welcome changing environments
20:19 - because the software web development
20:22 - landscape or development in general
20:24 - daniel's code
20:26 - is definitely always changing
20:29 - their backend production ecosystem is
20:31 - almost consistently a linux distro
20:34 - of some kind
20:35 - if you're not already a windows
20:38 - sorry if you're not already in a windows
20:40 - ecosystem then it has to be linux there
20:43 - is a high chance that you will be
20:45 - interacting with it
20:47 - via ssh
20:48 - api
20:50 - docker
20:51 - all the others
20:53 - so
20:53 - get familiar with batch scripting and
20:56 - the command line operations they will be
20:58 - your friends
21:00 - learn how to use a terminal be that
21:02 - power user
21:04 - it will be like magic to all
21:07 - give yourself the option
21:09 - the ability to approach any project
21:12 - open source or not
21:14 - not the software or the operating system
21:16 - choosing you
21:17 - enable yourself with the experience of
21:19 - knowing the other world of os this way
21:23 - you can increase your prospect for
21:25 - employability
21:26 - community collaborations productivity
21:29 - and efficiency in software development
21:32 - oh
21:33 - oh yes i mentioned
21:36 - the uh the windows subsystem for linux
21:38 - wsl in short
21:40 - this way you could sorry
21:43 - this it has been around for about five
21:45 - years and got a major update in may 2019
21:50 - ws wsl 2 which offers better performance
21:53 - and user experience
21:55 - so without getting too much into details
21:58 - this is windows
21:59 - with a linux terminal
22:01 - among other things
22:03 - have to think what that is
22:09 - in short
22:10 - it's all about security
22:12 - the terminal and the open source
22:15 - applications which are free these are
22:17 - all these are the ones that i want to
22:19 - highlight among others
22:21 - no microsoft office on linux is true
22:24 - there isn't one another problem
22:27 - there is an open source version
22:30 - for
22:30 - um just like office
22:32 - and it works just as good
22:35 - and it can also save
22:37 - the
22:37 - the files out in
22:39 - word
22:40 - uh compatible
22:42 - files
22:43 - uh doc or ctocs
22:47 - yeah from the likes
22:49 - so i would say
22:51 - i would also say to always look for
22:53 - alternatives to the ones that you are
22:55 - familiar with already
22:57 - be cures and test our competitor
22:59 - software
23:00 - both paid as well as open source
23:02 - counterparts
23:04 - know how to configure them correctly and
23:06 - observe best practices
23:10 - i have an interest in photography
23:12 - i do a lot of photo editing and post
23:15 - production works when i decide that i
23:17 - don't want to pay for adobe subscription
23:19 - fees
23:20 - anymore which can sometimes join up to
23:23 - more than a hundred dollars a year
23:26 - i know for a fact that i can always fall
23:28 - back to using the dog table and gi
23:32 - mp
23:33 - for linux
23:36 - they are the um the equivalent the
23:39 - equivalent of adobe's uh lightroom and
23:41 - photoshop respectively
23:43 - the best thing about that
23:45 - it still does exactly what i want
23:48 - this is just to illustrate that there
23:50 - are alternatives
23:51 - of course
23:52 - photoshop in my experience so far
23:55 - is far more superior
23:57 - but i don't take advantage of all the
23:59 - power features to justify for the for
24:02 - the subscription cost
24:05 - so yes
24:08 - the um the items to take away
24:12 - from here today about the topic we've
24:13 - discussed so far are the terminal
24:17 - and the fact that everything is
24:18 - customizable
24:21 - almost everything
24:22 - i think of it as having a pandora box
24:26 - which can
24:27 - enable me to do a lot more
24:30 - a smarter way of working
24:32 - and this is why i believe developers
24:35 - prefer
24:36 - linux
24:39 - here is some food for thoughts
24:42 - did you know
24:44 - that devices and applications around the
24:46 - world runs on the linux packet
24:50 - the usdod uses them extensively
24:54 - and the red hat runs in nuclear
24:55 - submarines did you know that linux is
24:58 - favored by defense tech giants
25:02 - like
25:03 - facebook apple amazon netflix google
25:07 - did you know also that 99 percent of the
25:10 - top fastest supercomputers of the world
25:12 - runs on linux
25:14 - or its basics
25:16 - even microsoft themselves contributes to
25:18 - their linux kernel development
25:21 - i'm definitely not suggesting hacking to
25:23 - a certain government's defense
25:25 - infrastructure as your open source
25:27 - projects please don't do that
25:30 - so
25:32 - back to choices what's it gonna be
25:35 - a windows machine
25:37 - or a macbook
25:39 - or
25:40 - in the the one in between get a linux if
25:42 - you're
25:43 - if you're curious about you know your
25:45 - development or is it maybe i see this i
25:47 - see it as a step towards uh the world
25:50 - linux
25:51 - you know if you're ever
25:53 - uh curious about
25:55 - getting a macbook but don't know how to
25:57 - use it yet but we but don't want to
25:59 - spend that much money yet
26:02 - try out linux
26:03 - i'll suggest you to try on linux
26:07 - and
26:09 - that's it
26:11 - i'm happy to take any questions you may
26:12 - have
26:14 - or dodge them
26:17 - nice
26:18 - uh thank you danny and thank you laura
26:21 - uh for bringing danny over
26:23 - that was an amazing presentation we
26:25 - actually had a lot of questions going on
26:26 - through the chat so i'm going to go
26:28 - through it now and look at them
26:30 - uh the latest one comes from ddl sds
26:34 - and he was wondering
26:37 - if so he
26:38 - these users starting front-end web
26:40 - development and he's wondering linux is
26:42 - going to help them much on front-end web
26:45 - development uh what do you think danny
26:49 - sorry can you please
26:50 - repeat um
26:52 - do you think that if you are a web
26:54 - developer you should be worried about
26:56 - things like am i using linux am i used
26:58 - to mac am i using windows
27:00 - is this um
27:03 - for that kind of developer like a web
27:05 - developer is that
27:06 - an important choice to make
27:11 - i don't i don't believe it it should be
27:13 - a worry at all but the point of all this
27:16 - uh this
27:19 - uh session uh is to to raise awareness
27:22 - that you should also be aware that there
27:24 - are the other
27:26 - environment that you can take advantage
27:28 - of that could enhance your experience in
27:32 - development
27:34 - because these days uh
27:37 - developments are mostly
27:40 - their code agnostics
27:42 - it is it is the
27:44 - the point here is that the terminal can
27:46 - can can give you a lot more a waste or
27:49 - different ways to work more efficiently
27:52 - so if you have been if you have been
27:54 - very comfortable while
27:56 - in the in the development working
27:58 - research in the indian web development
28:00 - then please continue
28:02 - but also i'm asking you to um to be
28:05 - curious on what it's like in your
28:08 - workflow in another environment see if
28:11 - you can achieve the same thing i'm sure
28:13 - you could but see if if you can uh
28:16 - uh
28:18 - work better
28:19 - in another environment this is more like
28:22 - an insurance uh if in event that you
28:24 - wanted to change that and you you can
28:27 - you can't
28:28 - move uh
28:29 - across it quite
28:31 - fast
28:32 - right okay
28:34 - yeah makes sense uh do you mind stop
28:36 - sharing your screens so we show our
28:38 - faces back to the audience
28:40 - i've been trying to find where zoom is
28:42 - so
28:43 - oh stop here yeah
28:45 - great
28:46 - okay um another question uh up here was
28:50 - uh when you show the graph with all the
28:52 - distros over time somebody was wondering
28:55 - if there's any major differences between
28:57 - distros
28:58 - or anything that they should know about
29:01 - when choosing one distro and another
29:04 - yes every distro is unique to the other
29:07 - two to the other one
29:09 - as i mentioned if you're not sure where
29:10 - to start
29:12 - the safest choice is to go for the
29:15 - distro that has the largest
29:17 - community support
29:19 - and that and the names that the
29:22 - that immediately comes to mind are
29:24 - ubuntu uh x ubuntu
29:28 - uh
29:29 - as well as debian
29:31 - uh that's these are all the desktop uh
29:36 - distros
29:37 - that you can you can pick and start with
29:40 - uh if you have any questions you can
29:42 - just type into your favorite search
29:43 - engine and you have uh you get a lot of
29:46 - support from community forums on how to
29:48 - do certain things uh and that's also the
29:51 - best place to start your exploration
29:53 - there
29:55 - and the thing is if you and the one
29:58 - common thing as i mentioned all the all
30:00 - the industrials have the terminals in
30:02 - them that you can take advantage of if
30:04 - you do not have to take advantage of the
30:06 - terminal that's okay you can use your
30:09 - the the limits distro just as your
30:12 - windows you know just as anything to do
30:14 - your daily your daily tasks
30:18 - i think it's um
30:19 - my first experience with the different
30:21 - kinds of distros happened when i started
30:23 - using a raspberry pi
30:25 - and i realized that because it's running
30:27 - on our arm architecture
30:30 - the raspbian that i was running that
30:32 - distro was a little different than the
30:33 - ubuntu i was running on my windows
30:35 - machine like you know my desktop so i
30:37 - think um it was different and it was fun
30:40 - also to just learn that there was little
30:42 - quirks little commands that weren't the
30:44 - same there were certain applications or
30:47 - tools that were a little different so i
30:49 - think uh the point that you were making
30:51 - earlier about how it's all about
30:53 - exploring your options and being
30:55 - flexible about the tools you use
30:57 - uh that's a really good point and and i
30:59 - mean if you like if you're going to be a
31:02 - developer if you if you're in the chat
31:03 - right now um and you're thinking about
31:05 - being a developer you're trying to learn
31:07 - to be a developer and get into tech uh
31:10 - being curious about the tools that you
31:12 - use it's it's going to be a key factor
31:14 - to your success professionally
31:16 - um so
31:19 - you know don't be afraid of using tools
31:20 - i think that's that's a great key
31:23 - takeaway from today let's see
31:26 - uh somebody
31:27 - in the chat was wondering
31:30 - um if i primarily use mac for
31:33 - development
31:34 - would you still use linux on the same
31:37 - machine
31:38 - okay so you have a macbook
31:40 - would what are the reasons why you would
31:42 - go for linux when you already have unix
31:44 - running on your macbook
31:46 - can you think of any specifics
31:49 - uh no because those who can afford a
31:52 - macbook already would not think of
31:54 - anything else
31:56 - as i mentioned in my
31:59 - earlier uh when i say linux i'm also
32:01 - kind of indirectly referring to the mac
32:04 - so once you're you're there and you know
32:07 - your uh your experience so you know what
32:10 - you you know your ways around then what
32:12 - your environment
32:13 - and you're comfortable with it already
32:15 - uh
32:16 - you know that's fine because even i have
32:18 - asked the question myself with my
32:20 - friends and other developers hey i see
32:22 - that you're you're using mac
32:25 - would you would you be able to do what
32:28 - you are doing right now as efficient if
32:30 - you do you know to set it up
32:33 - in a windows machine you're like nah i
32:35 - won't even consider it so
32:38 - yeah that makes sense you know sometimes
32:41 - it's not even your choice right uh i
32:43 - know that companies you know sometimes
32:44 - you get onboarded and they say well we
32:46 - are a back
32:47 - shop we are a mac uh office so here's
32:50 - your laptop your work laptop and it's a
32:51 - mac so sometimes uh for p sometimes for
32:54 - developers is the first time with a mac
32:56 - like you said they have they've been
32:58 - learning on windows their entire live
32:59 - maybe using linux and now they have a
33:01 - mac
33:02 - and they have to uh
33:04 - learn the way of the mac
33:06 - and i'm sure that some of them will the
33:08 - first thing that they do is try to
33:10 - revert it back to as much as linux as
33:12 - they can
33:13 - yes and and this is where i i begin to
33:17 - discover the
33:18 - [Music]
33:19 - the wsl
33:21 - uh it's it's a wonderful tool and i
33:23 - thought this is well this is like we do
33:25 - some crack really because now now you
33:28 - have a windows and you have the linux
33:30 - terminal within it and that and both of
33:33 - them works uh seamlessly uh well
33:36 - together
33:37 - and uh and it gives me the linux
33:40 - experience to be the linux terminal
33:42 - experience as well as
33:44 - being
33:45 - uh like on on the mac machine
33:47 - yeah uh because i do everything uh
33:50 - within the usd terminal a lot as well
33:54 - uh
33:55 - yeah
33:57 - it's uh i think somebody's asking here a
34:00 - question about
34:01 - they're asking the advantage of linux
34:03 - over the terminal and i'm assuming that
34:05 - what they mean is terminal the app on
34:07 - mac so
34:09 - uh i think mac terminal
34:12 - does it it runs bash or
34:15 - what does it run
34:16 - so i would imagine that the mac terminal
34:18 - and the linux terminal are
34:20 - fairly close they are fairly close
34:22 - because they are they you they are based
34:24 - on the unix kernel if i remember
34:26 - correctly they are similar but
34:28 - the both environments are as i mentioned
34:31 - they are not binary compatible however
34:34 - just on the terminal alone they are very
34:37 - similar
34:40 - and somebody else is asking
34:43 - can windows terminal work like unix
34:46 - so i'm assuming that the question there
34:48 - is does dos the work like
34:51 - no
34:52 - yeah personally don't hold me up on this
34:54 - against me personally i think this is
34:56 - the reason why a lot of us developers
34:59 - move away to
35:01 - leave windows and go to either a macbook
35:04 - or limits
35:06 - because of the the flexibility the the
35:09 - robustness of the of the terminal in the
35:11 - in the limits environment is far more
35:14 - superior than what
35:16 - cmd does can offer
35:19 - until the time when it came out with
35:21 - powershell
35:22 - and when i saw powershell i'm like you
35:24 - know it's
35:25 - i can't even understand it
35:27 - but then years later they came up with
35:30 - the wsl which now which means now i can
35:33 - run linux commands exactly like uh like
35:36 - batch commands
35:38 - in windows
35:40 - that's so it's not so much that windows
35:42 - got better they just borrowed the tools
35:45 - so
35:46 - which is why i highlighted uh
35:48 - there are a lot of linux like features
35:50 - that i think i'm beginning to see
35:52 - between these systems
35:53 - so again back to the point where where i
35:56 - say it is important or
35:58 - it is beneficial for you to know or to
36:01 - recognize that these these are the
36:03 - the features in each of this system and
36:06 - if you already know if you already know
36:08 - them then for you to transition from
36:11 - from one to the other is quite
36:13 - fast and easy because you recognize it
36:18 - uh i think someone is wondering if putty
36:21 - on windows would be better than using
36:23 - ssh on linux i'm not familiar with
36:26 - performance indices or if there's any
36:30 - particulars
36:32 - party is party is an application that
36:35 - really allows you to tunnel into a linux
36:38 - environment which is the the terminal
36:41 - now once you're once you are connected
36:43 - and tunneled into it you will be running
36:45 - bash commands which is why again i
36:47 - mentioned it is useful beneficial for
36:50 - you to be familiar with batch commands
36:53 - on the command line
36:57 - applications
36:58 - because then you'll be using you you
37:00 - guys have very high chances that you've
37:02 - been interacting with with them
37:05 - i moved from uh from on-premise
37:07 - development to cloud-based development
37:10 - uh implementations right now and a lot
37:12 - of them i have to to
37:14 - connect remotely uh through the ssh
37:17 - tunnels
37:18 - and run batch commands really so yeah
37:21 - it's not to say that one is better than
37:23 - the other but
37:25 - that party application tunnels into a
37:27 - uh the linux backend
37:30 - so i guess it's sort of a hidden
37:32 - question when you are trying to compare
37:33 - putty with uh as i said as you're you're
37:36 - talking about the same thing it's just
37:37 - presented different to the user and
37:39 - maybe users don't realize what's going
37:41 - on behind the scenes
37:44 - so because now with with with the wsl i
37:47 - can install linux on there and it gives
37:49 - me the terminal i don't have to use
37:51 - party
37:54 - it's all it's built in
37:55 - um
37:57 - lara do you have any questions for danny
37:59 - that maybe you prepare ahead of time or
38:01 - am i cutting into your time
38:05 - you're a mute
38:06 - um actually no um i think you've pretty
38:09 - much answered everything i was curious
38:11 - about but i just wanted to know and can
38:13 - you just remind me again which
38:14 - distribution or distributions are you
38:16 - currently using yourself
38:18 - and what's your work experience been
38:20 - like what just reasons have you been
38:22 - getting from the companies that you work
38:24 - for
38:25 - is that like a pattern or
38:27 - something so
38:28 - yeah
38:29 - the
38:30 - the very first one that i be that i have
38:32 - interacted with is centos
38:35 - which is based on a red hat
38:38 - variant
38:39 - um which is mainly implemented for their
38:42 - servers
38:43 - yeah
38:44 - and at that time i had to use ubuntu
38:48 - distro um they are
38:51 - compatible in one way or another um
38:54 - there isn't there isn't much of a
38:55 - problems uh in terms of uh experience
38:58 - anyway so my my experience with it has
39:01 - been great so far although admittedly it
39:04 - has been quite a challenge to learn
39:07 - coming from windows
39:10 - and i have tried all the uh the this uh
39:16 - steps sorry going through the uh the
39:20 - virtual box and then dual booting and
39:22 - then now i've completely left windows uh
39:25 - and
39:26 - for
39:26 - more than five years now i haven't
39:28 - really even looked back
39:30 - um
39:30 - i have also now in the last
39:33 - few months i think recently i've tried a
39:35 - new district called
39:37 - garuda it's a it's based on an arch arch
39:41 - linux
39:43 - architecture
39:45 - which is really different from from
39:47 - ubuntu
39:50 - but it's a it's a very beautiful uh gui
39:54 - and it's it's very pretty to look at but
39:58 - in terms of building out softwares or uh
40:01 - installing some applications in that
40:02 - it's a little different from uh from
40:05 - what i'm used to within ubuntu
40:12 - you're mute
40:14 - no i was wondering if i was just giving
40:16 - laura some time for more questions
40:21 - uh yeah people you know the chat just
40:23 - keeps going back and forth i think a lot
40:25 - of people are just like they keep
40:26 - comparing systems and trying to figure
40:28 - out which one is the best i think that's
40:30 - the nature of the internet we're always
40:31 - looking for rankings and who's the best
40:33 - of what
40:34 - um well i think the question here is if
40:36 - i may interject here it's uh yes it may
40:39 - seem relevant to find the best but i
40:41 - think what's more practical is to do is
40:44 - to is to
40:45 - choose the one that that is more
40:47 - relevant to you and then make the best
40:49 - out of it if if whatever your use case
40:52 - is doesn't fit into that
40:54 - the one that you've chosen explore
40:56 - another one
40:58 - right until you find
41:00 - uh find something that's more suitable
41:02 - but i do not imagine that you have to
41:04 - that you would have uh explored uh
41:07 - like 10th uh
41:09 - you know more than five or more than ten
41:11 - it it usually is within a handful of
41:14 - choices that you've made and that will
41:15 - that you will make the most out of it
41:17 - it's practicality is best for the use
41:20 - case not necessarily the best software
41:22 - out there
41:25 - it's um i think i had a professor once
41:28 - uh while i was going to college that
41:30 - explain it saying look when you look at
41:32 - racing they all have different kinds of
41:34 - tires for different environments you
41:36 - wouldn't ask a driver to have the same
41:38 - set of tires for every race in every
41:40 - condition
41:41 - and you have to think of operating
41:42 - systems this way you don't think about
41:44 - them which one is the best they all got
41:46 - they all have the role and they all have
41:48 - the tools and you just have to figure
41:51 - out what you're doing and where the
41:53 - tools are better for you
41:56 - so i guess it all comes keeps coming
41:58 - back to flexibility i think
42:00 - if anyone walks away today with one
42:02 - lesson is be flexible
42:04 - [Laughter]
42:05 - yeah
42:07 - true um
42:10 - okay um
42:12 - yeah i don't think anybody is having any
42:14 - other major questions someone is
42:16 - wondering our security and if distros
42:18 - have different levels of security
42:20 - um i would imagine that they are all
42:22 - more or less similar
42:24 - when we're talking about linux
42:25 - distributions
42:27 - yeah
42:28 - it is uh in my opinion uh and i'm sure
42:31 - uh the linux community would also agree
42:34 - uh uh much of this is that it is very
42:38 - secure um there's
42:40 - i mean personally like i said i've been
42:41 - using the linux for more than 10 years
42:43 - right now
42:44 - if you're talking about virus antiviral
42:46 - you know or having some kind of diverse
42:48 - software that runs on it
42:50 - i don't have one and i don't have to
42:52 - worry about one but also
42:55 - be mindful that it also depends on what
42:57 - websites and what you're downloading
43:00 - of course you can download virus without
43:02 - you know knowing but you know be mindful
43:04 - where you go and what you download and
43:07 - be be aware of cyber securities that
43:09 - these data topics are cyber securities
43:11 - you know what you get if you're if
43:13 - you're just doing development work uh
43:15 - searching for answers resolutions or
43:17 - searching for ideas working on projects
43:19 - or working well with
43:21 - open source collaborations
43:26 - generally you don't have to worry about
43:28 - viruses it is also secure because
43:30 - there's a the super user of the root
43:32 - password only you know
43:35 - any applications or malware that wants
43:38 - to make changes to your system will have
43:40 - to have uh
43:42 - your your root password
43:45 - uh
43:46 - yeah
43:47 - that's a really good part that's a
43:48 - really good uh point i remember setting
43:51 - up windows where the administrator or
43:53 - the machine would be by default the
43:54 - person that was installing the os
43:56 - and i remember someone saying what you
43:58 - should do is create a second user and
44:01 - always be running out of that restricted
44:03 - user because if your main user gets
44:05 - compromised on windows you are the the
44:08 - root of windows so
44:10 - you have a problem if that user gets
44:12 - compromised so even though it sounds
44:14 - counterintuitive that you own the
44:15 - machine and you want to be in a
44:17 - restricted user there is several
44:19 - advantages why you would want to be in
44:21 - that state uh and only allow for higher
44:25 - yeah high permissions uh in certain
44:26 - locations um
44:28 - that's uh
44:29 - that's a thing that linux has been doing
44:31 - for so long yeah exactly root is like
44:35 - being the god of of your phone system
44:38 - uh and there can only be one god in your
44:41 - environment which is you
44:42 - right no every everybody else
44:45 - no excess you want to make changes to
44:48 - some system files no access unless
44:51 - you're typing a password
44:53 - right
44:54 - yeah i think we can finish with one last
44:56 - question that came through the chat and
44:58 - uh it's about
45:00 - someone is wondering if if anyone can
45:02 - make edits or contribute to linux
45:04 - wouldn't that make it less secure
45:07 - there is a
45:09 - there is a point here however because
45:11 - it's a community-driven development
45:15 - there are
45:16 - organizations or
45:19 - basic community that
45:22 - checks
45:23 - peer review your codes and
45:26 - and there's there's always the people
45:28 - who are will be scrutinizing
45:31 - the way codes are written and
45:33 - if there are any issues that are that
45:35 - are highlighted there it will always be
45:37 - patched and fixed and
45:40 - ubuntu or the linux
45:44 - system is quite good at updating their
45:47 - system regularly
45:49 - and addressing any security issues
45:53 - in the background
45:54 - as well so this is where my confidence
45:57 - with the with the
45:59 - system
46:01 - that lies on
46:03 - in fact you could make the argument that
46:05 - it is more secure than closed systems
46:07 - because in closed systems like windows
46:09 - they have to depend on their engineers
46:11 - finding bugs and fixing them and
46:13 - patching security flaws well in places
46:15 - like ubuntu linux a community of tens of
46:18 - thousands or millions of people the
46:20 - likelihood of them discovering these
46:22 - vulnerabilities and fixing them quicker
46:24 - than a private company would it's
46:26 - uh i i've heard that point before what i
46:28 - would say you know
46:30 - big companies like microsoft only have
46:32 - so many engineers in their staff and
46:33 - they only have so much time to find
46:35 - errors or bugs or vulnerabilities by the
46:38 - community it's millions around the world
46:40 - in all time zones and they can find
46:42 - problems all the time much more quickly
46:44 - so i've actually heard the argument that
46:46 - is more secure precisely because
46:49 - everybody's contributing not not not the
46:51 - other way around not less secure because
46:53 - everyone's control that is that is a
46:54 - very very good point
46:56 - thank you
46:58 - do you use um linux academy or is that
47:01 - something you can talk about
47:03 - we have macs at code academy and i know
47:05 - that most people use linux for the back
47:08 - end so
47:09 - uh it's a mix of both yeah it's kind of
47:11 - like what danny was saying once you're
47:13 - in a max unix environment uh it becomes
47:16 - kind of like a very fussy
47:19 - uh gray line are you on unix are you on
47:22 - linux are you like it's all become sort
47:24 - of the same thing so
47:26 - that's that's how we run
47:27 - uh i know that we have some engineers
47:29 - that have windows machines laying around
47:31 - so that we make sure that uh code
47:32 - academy the website runs well in
47:35 - internet explorer and other browsers
47:37 - that might be windows only or windows
47:39 - specific um but uh most of the time
47:42 - people are running google chrome or
47:43 - firefox which are
47:45 - browser engines that run pretty much the
47:47 - same based on uh on linux mac on windows
47:51 - so
47:52 - um that's been really helpful for
47:54 - development because uh you know uh edge
47:57 - even microsoft edge now runs on chromium
47:59 - which is the same technology that chrome
48:01 - uses so
48:02 - um
48:03 - it's becoming all sort of the same thing
48:05 - and so having to develop for 10
48:07 - different systems you're developing for
48:08 - two or three now
48:10 - um i remember
48:12 - reading that chrome os is actually a
48:15 - linux district type linux history
48:19 - i wouldn't be surprised
48:20 - [Laughter]
48:23 - just based on whole chrome os yeah i
48:24 - mean google likes linux for sure
48:27 - yeah um
48:29 - well laura i mean if um we don't have
48:31 - any other questions so uh whatever you
48:32 - want to do next you want to wrap this up
48:36 - yeah i think we can uh pretty much
48:37 - finish i thanks everyone for attending
48:40 - um thanks tony and feather for your time
48:42 - especially fedor for
48:43 - waking up extra early today
48:46 - oh yeah he's
48:57 - uh thanks everybody yeah uh danny you
49:00 - want to send them off uh any any last
49:02 - words of wisdom about linux
49:04 - anything that you would like to share
49:06 - party thoughts um partying styles i i
49:09 - think the point i'm trying to make here
49:10 - is really to to to enable yourself
49:15 - and be flexible
49:17 - when it comes to development and do not
49:20 - shy away from changing environments
49:22 - i have experiences myself as i mentioned
49:25 - in the
49:26 - i'm going to get the
49:28 - the analogy a lot like a salsa dance
49:30 - i was completely frozen because i was
49:32 - given a macbook
49:34 - and it took me quite a while to get used
49:36 - to things over there but
49:38 - the my linux experience did help bt
49:41 - to to
49:43 - continue my delivery quite fast faster
49:46 - yeah quicker
49:47 - so yeah enable yourself be flexible
49:50 - don't shy away from challenges or
49:53 - unknown areas of
49:55 - software and be curious
49:57 - that's what i'm trying to say
50:01 - okay well thank you again everybody for
50:03 - stopping by and uh hopefully we'll bring
50:05 - people back soon live on our youtube
50:08 - channel and keep learning all
50:10 - together have a good one

Cleaned transcript:

all right hi everyone and welcome my name is laura i'm the chapter lead for academy seoul here in south korea and i'm here today with danny who is going to talk to us about linux and the way this is going to work danny has put together a presentation for us which is going to take 30 35 minutes after which we'll be taking questions from the audience so if you do have any questions please post them in the live chat and we'll do our best to answer them running over to you if you could please introduce yourself um right do it okay hi i'm dan um oh um i'm a uh i live in the uk uh based in london uh i'm a data engineer uh by profession uh and i've been doing this for about 1315 years so so i'm quite honored to be happy to have you given this opportunity to be here to tell you a few things about uh about this topic on why do you developers prefer linux let's get started i'm just going to pull out screen share and launch so um yep hello um i hope you're all well and safe hopefully uh at the end of this session you will have a couple of things to think about uh in your journey to becoming a developer this is not a technical discussion uh just you have to remind yourself that uh also we'll be taking it easy let's get started if you don't already know linux that's okay i can only guess that you are here because you want to know more about it and how it can benefit you in your projects or at work so choices the image are the images on either sides must be a familiar scenario when you decide on your next brand new computer in my opinion the one on the right is far too expensive so i can safely assume a large majority of us would settle for the one on the left however many developers i've come across have expressed their preference for the mac for development and i'm here to shed some light on the on why you should be aware of not one but both systems especially in the context of development well the penguin is in between the two but it doesn't exist in either machine you have to go and get it hello uh again just brief introduction um i'm dan and i've been teaching myself how to code and i've been involved in numerous projects building applications software developments and data solutions for the past 13 years i have worked with within the windows linux and the mac os i deal mainly with data in my world this is the etl specialist but it is now more glamorous to be known as data engineer so that's who and what i am chances are that the large majority of you here on the windows operating system you may have been using it for a while and may be comfortable making system changes but on a minimal scale to be safe if you're not that's uh that's absolutely fine as well i'm not here to call you on that and for the more advanced audience if you are here did you know that you can practically navigate windows using just a keyboard forget the mouse can you believe it using windows without the mouse that would be quite an experience there was a time the unthinkable happened my fear of wireless pointing device and mouse had a heart attack i was on windows and i was completely paralyzed i was unable to complete even the most basic task of browsing the internet for technical help it was then i discovered keyboard shortcuts i never knew and in retrospect i was convinced to this day that the mouse can be made redundant most of the time but for a better user experience you know what to do keep it and make sure it's still alive so how is this short story any relevant to this topic well again i have worked on you a number of interesting data projects depending on the project i found myself switching between operating systems like the sales events and i have found it particularly interesting as it is important to know exactly what must be done to set up a viable development environment on my machine and be ready to adapt i'd like to point out here that knowing your os means knowing how to set up your development environment this means configuring applications open source tools text editors which are easy and straightforward most of the time this includes applications that you already know as well as the ones you don't because some companies have their own list of approved softwares that can be installed onto your to your machine that can only be installed onto your machine this is typically big companies however doing them right at the start will save you from future headaches and mess that's the difference just like the dance if you were pulled out to the dance floor and it was your first time to salsa or or dance of any kind you will be like stiff frozen and may not even feel the lens at all i felt the same paralysis in a sense of not knowing what to do when i had to start a project on a provisioned macbook it was my first you see working in the it in the uk you are usually alone um a machine when you join a company so you never know what you're gonna get that's not a quote from uh what's that tom hanks a movie i can't remember what it's like anyway i don't know what it's like in other parts of the world but perhaps one of you can tell me at the end of this session i'll be very curious to know so with that it took me quite a while to get used to the new os let alone setting up after some time i can say that i have had a positive experience because of my familiarity with linux personally i think it wasn't just about the macbook or linux but more on customization in other words hackability you see i have seen first hand power developers move blocks of codes copy paste it search and replace text then jumps from line 35 to 1287 to insert a function and does the same thing all over again in different places save the changes and immediately in another active terminal session the unit testing for that script kicks off when that task pass in just a few more keystrokes the code has been committed and pushed to his github repository all in the flash boom the party was over within a minute or what felt like a minute the mouse wasn't even there or was it not even involved it was fascinating to watch and behind the scenes all of that was made possible because of customization i was like whoa that's productivity over the roof that was unbelievable truly the one thing that both the mac elements have in common is the terminal this is where you run bash commands among other things depending on the specialization or your specialization the developer can spend up to 65 percent of their time within the terminal if not more when when you can hack your system and benefit your will so to speak you will see your productivity improve just like that developer this includes automating some mundane tasks creating terminal shortcuts aliases functions scripting up preloaded environment and many more that guy had everything under his control it's like magic for an average user when you look at him you will not you will not even have a clue what what just happened but if you were to peel it under the under the the layers if you were to examine there were many things that have been automated what this means that it means that many keystrokes can be saved which means it will save you time which means more time for you to focus on what's more important and solutionizing them which means your delivery cadence goes up there are many native tools or small applications in which are simple to use customizable and i dare say powerful they are the command line applications that we have come to to know and love i am referring to tools like the one listed here not find which man kill cat but actually each of these is a key word for an application i just just arrange them intentionally to you know yeah so just like this one's here i said all of which the most seasoned developers know of and have exploited and the beautiful thing about all these tools is that they can be chained together for sequential execution only one line if you want to you can create your own simple application this way to automate certain things just to mention quickly the mac os is based on the bsd code base which is unique it is similar to the linux system however they are not binary compatible okay so because of the similarities between the unix and the linux distros or the linux in other words the mac os and the linux distros these tools are widely available in both operating system and when i say linux here excuse me i'm also indirectly referring to the mac so as mentioned you can customize your environment using property files dot files system and local environment paths as well as creating environment functions to boost productivity and to automate certain repetitive tasks there are documentation as well on how to use each of these these tools from the terminal if you just need to be reminded just to highlight other favorites on the mac you can add new workspaces and swipe sideways to them this allows you to better organize your open applications and helps you focus on your thoughts depending on which workspace you are in so emails for me emails and messaging in one space text editors encoding application in another space the web browser in the other space depending on how you want to organize it yeah so similarly you can find multiple virtual desktop environments in linux as well depending on the chosen desktop environment when you install it such as the pde no and others oh there's also launching application like typing it out i think this didn't happen until windows 7. thanks to development in linux distro and mac os and last but not least the availability and accessibility of numerous open source softwares at the touch of your fingertips just key into just key them into the terminal you get it no end user license agreement buttons to read and click anymore it must have been ages ago since i last saw eula she wasn't nice it was always her way or the highway if you're like me if you're like me stuck on it on a technical problem i'll consult stack overflow or at least if uh type that i'll type that out in a search engine uh most of the time the stack overflow result will come up to the top is where we all go to again depending on the problem you're trying to solve in my area of expertise those uh those responses are almost always going to be a command line explanation they are a more direct resolution just as a doctor would prescribe a drug for your ailment so windows has not really been a popular has not really been popular among developers it has a reputation of being unstable and unreliable now emphasis here is that this may no longer be the case but its stained reputation has remained stubborn to come off the mind don't get me wrong because i am also aware and know of developers developing only within the windows ecosystem and will raise a finger at linux and the mac so which linux you may ask can i install linux no because there isn't a linux os to install but you can choose a linux distribution for installation for example there are at least seven categories and hundreds of digitals available to be had i will not discuss them here just take a look all free and available except for the red hat and some of its variant if you look at this is a slackware um category and it's got like i don't know 10 so at least 50 of them it is arranged by timeline from 1992 to today and the line extends beyond 2018 which means they're still available here the debian stack variant has got a lot of this uh distros and each of them if you go to your website you can download and install them yeah okay so what i want to say here is this over the decades i noticed the shift towards adaptations or limits like features on windows i believe this was not just a strategic move to recapture some developers they may have lost over time in terms of market share but more on the point of recognition on the fact that linux is more efficient by comparison i do not hope to see my windows get thrown eggs and tomatoes for making this stigma but anyway it really depends on the need and requirements for the project if i'm honest then it means most of the time so what does it mean for you what are leaners like features the ones that immediately comes to mind are launching your applications by typing them out after pressing the windows key recent additions of the windows subsystem for linux that you didn't know this then there's the terminal specifically powershell not the cmd which is dos multiple desktop workspaces like those on the mac machines this was since windows 10 or six years ago um and then there's this free for all package management you know like on the mac you can get the home brew which is free it says uh the sort of the home brew to access most open source applications if not all so oh by the way there are a lot of things that can be done or actually are done and achieved through the terminal it's a very important uh feature for within linux so like i said uh these are the similarities okay and just to remind ourselves this is a nontechnical also keeping their normal technicals and these are all high level similarities so how do you get into it how do you get started if you haven't already you can run it on virtualbox or vmware download the distro's image and load it up in there it's a nondestructive way of having another os virtualized within windows when you are more comfortable with linux and have found yourself spending more time with open source projects or just wants to hack consider dual booting you can always boot back to windows or boot windows out completely and just put a linux distro in it or two or five if you want or get a macbook if you can afford it and please do not install windows that i shall not say it's a dumb thing to do nope i haven't said it ubuntu is widely supported and has a strong community base there it is one of the most popular linux desktop distro out there so you can start looking over there i'm not here to convince you to ditch windows entirely no but rather question on how fast you can adapt and switch without loss of productivity if or when situation changes but you're not familiar with that situation or if the project that you are interested in is of an open source collaborative but you don't have the proper environment or if your production environment is not a windows ecosystem and you have problems deploying to it because your windows your machine is windows what would you do you can certainly resist change and insist on the one thing that you're already familiar with there is absolutely no problem with that but i want you to be flexible adaptable fluid like welcome changing environments because the software web development landscape or development in general daniel's code is definitely always changing their backend production ecosystem is almost consistently a linux distro of some kind if you're not already a windows sorry if you're not already in a windows ecosystem then it has to be linux there is a high chance that you will be interacting with it via ssh api docker all the others so get familiar with batch scripting and the command line operations they will be your friends learn how to use a terminal be that power user it will be like magic to all give yourself the option the ability to approach any project open source or not not the software or the operating system choosing you enable yourself with the experience of knowing the other world of os this way you can increase your prospect for employability community collaborations productivity and efficiency in software development oh oh yes i mentioned the uh the windows subsystem for linux wsl in short this way you could sorry this it has been around for about five years and got a major update in may 2019 ws wsl 2 which offers better performance and user experience so without getting too much into details this is windows with a linux terminal among other things have to think what that is in short it's all about security the terminal and the open source applications which are free these are all these are the ones that i want to highlight among others no microsoft office on linux is true there isn't one another problem there is an open source version for um just like office and it works just as good and it can also save the the files out in word uh compatible files uh doc or ctocs yeah from the likes so i would say i would also say to always look for alternatives to the ones that you are familiar with already be cures and test our competitor software both paid as well as open source counterparts know how to configure them correctly and observe best practices i have an interest in photography i do a lot of photo editing and post production works when i decide that i don't want to pay for adobe subscription fees anymore which can sometimes join up to more than a hundred dollars a year i know for a fact that i can always fall back to using the dog table and gi mp for linux they are the um the equivalent the equivalent of adobe's uh lightroom and photoshop respectively the best thing about that it still does exactly what i want this is just to illustrate that there are alternatives of course photoshop in my experience so far is far more superior but i don't take advantage of all the power features to justify for the for the subscription cost so yes the um the items to take away from here today about the topic we've discussed so far are the terminal and the fact that everything is customizable almost everything i think of it as having a pandora box which can enable me to do a lot more a smarter way of working and this is why i believe developers prefer linux here is some food for thoughts did you know that devices and applications around the world runs on the linux packet the usdod uses them extensively and the red hat runs in nuclear submarines did you know that linux is favored by defense tech giants like facebook apple amazon netflix google did you know also that 99 percent of the top fastest supercomputers of the world runs on linux or its basics even microsoft themselves contributes to their linux kernel development i'm definitely not suggesting hacking to a certain government's defense infrastructure as your open source projects please don't do that so back to choices what's it gonna be a windows machine or a macbook or in the the one in between get a linux if you're if you're curious about you know your development or is it maybe i see this i see it as a step towards uh the world linux you know if you're ever uh curious about getting a macbook but don't know how to use it yet but we but don't want to spend that much money yet try out linux i'll suggest you to try on linux and that's it i'm happy to take any questions you may have or dodge them nice uh thank you danny and thank you laura uh for bringing danny over that was an amazing presentation we actually had a lot of questions going on through the chat so i'm going to go through it now and look at them uh the latest one comes from ddl sds and he was wondering if so he these users starting frontend web development and he's wondering linux is going to help them much on frontend web development uh what do you think danny sorry can you please repeat um do you think that if you are a web developer you should be worried about things like am i using linux am i used to mac am i using windows is this um for that kind of developer like a web developer is that an important choice to make i don't i don't believe it it should be a worry at all but the point of all this uh this uh session uh is to to raise awareness that you should also be aware that there are the other environment that you can take advantage of that could enhance your experience in development because these days uh developments are mostly their code agnostics it is it is the the point here is that the terminal can can can give you a lot more a waste or different ways to work more efficiently so if you have been if you have been very comfortable while in the in the development working research in the indian web development then please continue but also i'm asking you to um to be curious on what it's like in your workflow in another environment see if you can achieve the same thing i'm sure you could but see if if you can uh uh work better in another environment this is more like an insurance uh if in event that you wanted to change that and you you can you can't move uh across it quite fast right okay yeah makes sense uh do you mind stop sharing your screens so we show our faces back to the audience i've been trying to find where zoom is so oh stop here yeah great okay um another question uh up here was uh when you show the graph with all the distros over time somebody was wondering if there's any major differences between distros or anything that they should know about when choosing one distro and another yes every distro is unique to the other two to the other one as i mentioned if you're not sure where to start the safest choice is to go for the distro that has the largest community support and that and the names that the that immediately comes to mind are ubuntu uh x ubuntu uh as well as debian uh that's these are all the desktop uh distros that you can you can pick and start with uh if you have any questions you can just type into your favorite search engine and you have uh you get a lot of support from community forums on how to do certain things uh and that's also the best place to start your exploration there and the thing is if you and the one common thing as i mentioned all the all the industrials have the terminals in them that you can take advantage of if you do not have to take advantage of the terminal that's okay you can use your the the limits distro just as your windows you know just as anything to do your daily your daily tasks i think it's um my first experience with the different kinds of distros happened when i started using a raspberry pi and i realized that because it's running on our arm architecture the raspbian that i was running that distro was a little different than the ubuntu i was running on my windows machine like you know my desktop so i think um it was different and it was fun also to just learn that there was little quirks little commands that weren't the same there were certain applications or tools that were a little different so i think uh the point that you were making earlier about how it's all about exploring your options and being flexible about the tools you use uh that's a really good point and and i mean if you like if you're going to be a developer if you if you're in the chat right now um and you're thinking about being a developer you're trying to learn to be a developer and get into tech uh being curious about the tools that you use it's it's going to be a key factor to your success professionally um so you know don't be afraid of using tools i think that's that's a great key takeaway from today let's see uh somebody in the chat was wondering um if i primarily use mac for development would you still use linux on the same machine okay so you have a macbook would what are the reasons why you would go for linux when you already have unix running on your macbook can you think of any specifics uh no because those who can afford a macbook already would not think of anything else as i mentioned in my earlier uh when i say linux i'm also kind of indirectly referring to the mac so once you're you're there and you know your uh your experience so you know what you you know your ways around then what your environment and you're comfortable with it already uh you know that's fine because even i have asked the question myself with my friends and other developers hey i see that you're you're using mac would you would you be able to do what you are doing right now as efficient if you do you know to set it up in a windows machine you're like nah i won't even consider it so yeah that makes sense you know sometimes it's not even your choice right uh i know that companies you know sometimes you get onboarded and they say well we are a back shop we are a mac uh office so here's your laptop your work laptop and it's a mac so sometimes uh for p sometimes for developers is the first time with a mac like you said they have they've been learning on windows their entire live maybe using linux and now they have a mac and they have to uh learn the way of the mac and i'm sure that some of them will the first thing that they do is try to revert it back to as much as linux as they can yes and and this is where i i begin to discover the the wsl uh it's it's a wonderful tool and i thought this is well this is like we do some crack really because now now you have a windows and you have the linux terminal within it and that and both of them works uh seamlessly uh well together and uh and it gives me the linux experience to be the linux terminal experience as well as being uh like on on the mac machine yeah uh because i do everything uh within the usd terminal a lot as well uh yeah it's uh i think somebody's asking here a question about they're asking the advantage of linux over the terminal and i'm assuming that what they mean is terminal the app on mac so uh i think mac terminal does it it runs bash or what does it run so i would imagine that the mac terminal and the linux terminal are fairly close they are fairly close because they are they you they are based on the unix kernel if i remember correctly they are similar but the both environments are as i mentioned they are not binary compatible however just on the terminal alone they are very similar and somebody else is asking can windows terminal work like unix so i'm assuming that the question there is does dos the work like no yeah personally don't hold me up on this against me personally i think this is the reason why a lot of us developers move away to leave windows and go to either a macbook or limits because of the the flexibility the the robustness of the of the terminal in the in the limits environment is far more superior than what cmd does can offer until the time when it came out with powershell and when i saw powershell i'm like you know it's i can't even understand it but then years later they came up with the wsl which now which means now i can run linux commands exactly like uh like batch commands in windows that's so it's not so much that windows got better they just borrowed the tools so which is why i highlighted uh there are a lot of linux like features that i think i'm beginning to see between these systems so again back to the point where where i say it is important or it is beneficial for you to know or to recognize that these these are the the features in each of this system and if you already know if you already know them then for you to transition from from one to the other is quite fast and easy because you recognize it uh i think someone is wondering if putty on windows would be better than using ssh on linux i'm not familiar with performance indices or if there's any particulars party is party is an application that really allows you to tunnel into a linux environment which is the the terminal now once you're once you are connected and tunneled into it you will be running bash commands which is why again i mentioned it is useful beneficial for you to be familiar with batch commands on the command line applications because then you'll be using you you guys have very high chances that you've been interacting with with them i moved from uh from onpremise development to cloudbased development uh implementations right now and a lot of them i have to to connect remotely uh through the ssh tunnels and run batch commands really so yeah it's not to say that one is better than the other but that party application tunnels into a uh the linux backend so i guess it's sort of a hidden question when you are trying to compare putty with uh as i said as you're you're talking about the same thing it's just presented different to the user and maybe users don't realize what's going on behind the scenes so because now with with with the wsl i can install linux on there and it gives me the terminal i don't have to use party it's all it's built in um lara do you have any questions for danny that maybe you prepare ahead of time or am i cutting into your time you're a mute um actually no um i think you've pretty much answered everything i was curious about but i just wanted to know and can you just remind me again which distribution or distributions are you currently using yourself and what's your work experience been like what just reasons have you been getting from the companies that you work for is that like a pattern or something so yeah the the very first one that i be that i have interacted with is centos which is based on a red hat variant um which is mainly implemented for their servers yeah and at that time i had to use ubuntu distro um they are compatible in one way or another um there isn't there isn't much of a problems uh in terms of uh experience anyway so my my experience with it has been great so far although admittedly it has been quite a challenge to learn coming from windows and i have tried all the uh the this uh steps sorry going through the uh the virtual box and then dual booting and then now i've completely left windows uh and for more than five years now i haven't really even looked back um i have also now in the last few months i think recently i've tried a new district called garuda it's a it's based on an arch arch linux architecture which is really different from from ubuntu but it's a it's a very beautiful uh gui and it's it's very pretty to look at but in terms of building out softwares or uh installing some applications in that it's a little different from uh from what i'm used to within ubuntu you're mute no i was wondering if i was just giving laura some time for more questions uh yeah people you know the chat just keeps going back and forth i think a lot of people are just like they keep comparing systems and trying to figure out which one is the best i think that's the nature of the internet we're always looking for rankings and who's the best of what um well i think the question here is if i may interject here it's uh yes it may seem relevant to find the best but i think what's more practical is to do is to is to choose the one that that is more relevant to you and then make the best out of it if if whatever your use case is doesn't fit into that the one that you've chosen explore another one right until you find uh find something that's more suitable but i do not imagine that you have to that you would have uh explored uh like 10th uh you know more than five or more than ten it it usually is within a handful of choices that you've made and that will that you will make the most out of it it's practicality is best for the use case not necessarily the best software out there it's um i think i had a professor once uh while i was going to college that explain it saying look when you look at racing they all have different kinds of tires for different environments you wouldn't ask a driver to have the same set of tires for every race in every condition and you have to think of operating systems this way you don't think about them which one is the best they all got they all have the role and they all have the tools and you just have to figure out what you're doing and where the tools are better for you so i guess it all comes keeps coming back to flexibility i think if anyone walks away today with one lesson is be flexible [Laughter] yeah true um okay um yeah i don't think anybody is having any other major questions someone is wondering our security and if distros have different levels of security um i would imagine that they are all more or less similar when we're talking about linux distributions yeah it is uh in my opinion uh and i'm sure uh the linux community would also agree uh uh much of this is that it is very secure um there's i mean personally like i said i've been using the linux for more than 10 years right now if you're talking about virus antiviral you know or having some kind of diverse software that runs on it i don't have one and i don't have to worry about one but also be mindful that it also depends on what websites and what you're downloading of course you can download virus without you know knowing but you know be mindful where you go and what you download and be be aware of cyber securities that these data topics are cyber securities you know what you get if you're if you're just doing development work uh searching for answers resolutions or searching for ideas working on projects or working well with open source collaborations generally you don't have to worry about viruses it is also secure because there's a the super user of the root password only you know any applications or malware that wants to make changes to your system will have to have uh your your root password uh yeah that's a really good part that's a really good uh point i remember setting up windows where the administrator or the machine would be by default the person that was installing the os and i remember someone saying what you should do is create a second user and always be running out of that restricted user because if your main user gets compromised on windows you are the the root of windows so you have a problem if that user gets compromised so even though it sounds counterintuitive that you own the machine and you want to be in a restricted user there is several advantages why you would want to be in that state uh and only allow for higher yeah high permissions uh in certain locations um that's uh that's a thing that linux has been doing for so long yeah exactly root is like being the god of of your phone system uh and there can only be one god in your environment which is you right no every everybody else no excess you want to make changes to some system files no access unless you're typing a password right yeah i think we can finish with one last question that came through the chat and uh it's about someone is wondering if if anyone can make edits or contribute to linux wouldn't that make it less secure there is a there is a point here however because it's a communitydriven development there are organizations or basic community that checks peer review your codes and and there's there's always the people who are will be scrutinizing the way codes are written and if there are any issues that are that are highlighted there it will always be patched and fixed and ubuntu or the linux system is quite good at updating their system regularly and addressing any security issues in the background as well so this is where my confidence with the with the system that lies on in fact you could make the argument that it is more secure than closed systems because in closed systems like windows they have to depend on their engineers finding bugs and fixing them and patching security flaws well in places like ubuntu linux a community of tens of thousands or millions of people the likelihood of them discovering these vulnerabilities and fixing them quicker than a private company would it's uh i i've heard that point before what i would say you know big companies like microsoft only have so many engineers in their staff and they only have so much time to find errors or bugs or vulnerabilities by the community it's millions around the world in all time zones and they can find problems all the time much more quickly so i've actually heard the argument that is more secure precisely because everybody's contributing not not not the other way around not less secure because everyone's control that is that is a very very good point thank you do you use um linux academy or is that something you can talk about we have macs at code academy and i know that most people use linux for the back end so uh it's a mix of both yeah it's kind of like what danny was saying once you're in a max unix environment uh it becomes kind of like a very fussy uh gray line are you on unix are you on linux are you like it's all become sort of the same thing so that's that's how we run uh i know that we have some engineers that have windows machines laying around so that we make sure that uh code academy the website runs well in internet explorer and other browsers that might be windows only or windows specific um but uh most of the time people are running google chrome or firefox which are browser engines that run pretty much the same based on uh on linux mac on windows so um that's been really helpful for development because uh you know uh edge even microsoft edge now runs on chromium which is the same technology that chrome uses so um it's becoming all sort of the same thing and so having to develop for 10 different systems you're developing for two or three now um i remember reading that chrome os is actually a linux district type linux history i wouldn't be surprised [Laughter] just based on whole chrome os yeah i mean google likes linux for sure yeah um well laura i mean if um we don't have any other questions so uh whatever you want to do next you want to wrap this up yeah i think we can uh pretty much finish i thanks everyone for attending um thanks tony and feather for your time especially fedor for waking up extra early today oh yeah he's uh thanks everybody yeah uh danny you want to send them off uh any any last words of wisdom about linux anything that you would like to share party thoughts um partying styles i i think the point i'm trying to make here is really to to to enable yourself and be flexible when it comes to development and do not shy away from changing environments i have experiences myself as i mentioned in the i'm going to get the the analogy a lot like a salsa dance i was completely frozen because i was given a macbook and it took me quite a while to get used to things over there but the my linux experience did help bt to to continue my delivery quite fast faster yeah quicker so yeah enable yourself be flexible don't shy away from challenges or unknown areas of software and be curious that's what i'm trying to say okay well thank you again everybody for stopping by and uh hopefully we'll bring people back soon live on our youtube channel and keep learning all together have a good one
