00:00 - everybody i'm going to pass it on to
00:01 - laura and feel free to introduce
00:03 - yourselves
00:05 - hi everyone welcome to the stream my
00:07 - name is laura i'm the chapter leaper
00:09 - called academy soul and i'm here with
00:12 - fedor who's the community manager for
00:14 - cool
00:14 - academy our guest today is dr katharina
00:18 - groga or dr kat for short dr cat
00:21 - graduated with a phd in chemistry from
00:24 - the humboldt university of berlin in
00:26 - 2018
00:28 - and she started working for basf a year
00:31 - prior
00:32 - since then dr cat has gained a wealth of
00:35 - experience as a manager
00:37 - some of which she would like to share
00:38 - with us today welcome dr cat and thanks
00:41 - for joining over to you
00:43 - yeah
00:44 - thank both of you thanks peter thanks
00:46 - laura and also thanks for the
00:47 - opportunity to share my expertise with
00:50 - you in this in this round
00:53 - i'm diving in from berlin germany right
00:55 - now
00:56 - and before i also jump into the topic i
00:59 - also comment a little bit about why i'm
01:02 - so interested to talk about this this
01:04 - topic and why is it so so close to my
01:06 - heart so the topic about what do
01:08 - employers look for in a data scientist
01:10 - or also in a data engineer
01:13 - so i also prepared some slides so i
01:15 - start sharing the screen so that we can
01:18 - follow also the logic of the talk
01:20 - together
01:22 - so i hope you can see my screen now
01:24 - maybe this is a brief introduction um
01:27 - about myself thanks laura
01:29 - um yeah as already introduced i'm
01:32 - located here in berlin germany and
01:34 - actually i did my thesis and and also my
01:37 - studies in the area of chemistry more
01:40 - specific by organic chemistry which does
01:42 - not sound like the easiest topic to now
01:44 - go to data science but i come to it in a
01:46 - minute why data science data engineering
01:49 - is so interesting to me
01:52 - with my background in chemistry i joined
01:55 - bsf as one of the biggest chemical
01:57 - companies in the world directly after my
02:00 - studies
02:01 - and within my time with bsf i changed a
02:04 - couple of positions so while starting in
02:06 - data management for chemical data i then
02:09 - switched to as large just mentioned to
02:11 - the role of becoming also hiring manager
02:14 - for other profiles than just the
02:16 - chemical process so starting with data
02:18 - management i was also working
02:21 - as disciplinary leader for topics of
02:24 - profiles in the area of data science
02:26 - data engineering but also developers
02:29 - and during this time i really enjoy
02:33 - working with with data scientist data
02:35 - engineers but some experiences during
02:37 - the interviews made me think
02:39 - whether it wouldn't be valuable to share
02:41 - some thoughts and some experiences that
02:44 - i gained with especially young people
02:47 - who want to enter this area and this is
02:50 - why this
02:52 - occasion and this talk is so close to my
02:53 - heart because this is the option and the
02:55 - opportunity to do so
02:57 - so
02:59 - what's the talk about
03:01 - i switch to the next and what it's not
03:04 - about so
03:05 - i see this as an opportunity to share my
03:07 - experiences so i will also talk as me as
03:10 - a private person so even though i made a
03:12 - lot of experience in the job context
03:14 - with bsf i'm not here to speak as a
03:17 - representative of the company i'm here
03:19 - as a private person to share my
03:21 - experience
03:22 - and three steps or three stages
03:25 - are relevant here so
03:27 - ideas you should have and and thoughts
03:29 - you should make before the job interview
03:33 - the job interview itself
03:35 - and also what's important in this area
03:37 - when you are in your work environment
03:39 - so the title says
03:41 - what do employers look for a data
03:43 - scientist but also as i said and
03:46 - mentioned um
03:48 - my experience is not only based on data
03:50 - science but also data engineering
03:51 - development so this is more like broad
03:54 - term for all this kind of i.t and data
03:57 - related profiles
03:58 - however i'm more focusing on junior
04:00 - positions so i hope this is also
04:03 - something which um you as an audience
04:05 - are more interested in it also just um
04:08 - comes with with the simple fact that i
04:10 - am more hiring in the junior profile
04:13 - area
04:14 - and also questions are highly welcome
04:16 - we'll have a q a section at the end but
04:18 - also um laura feder feel free to jump in
04:22 - and ask questions if you if you feel
04:24 - like it
04:25 - also to clarify what it's not about
04:29 - i will not talk about prioritizing any
04:31 - kind of specific languages or coding
04:34 - skills this is very individual for every
04:37 - employer and every position um if you
04:40 - want to really make sure that the
04:42 - position you apply for is covering or is
04:45 - in alignment with your skill set read
04:48 - the job office or call the recruiting
04:50 - team and ask them so i will not do
04:52 - prioritization here
04:54 - also i will not comment on cvs cvs are
04:57 - very regional specific so any piece of
05:00 - advice i would give here might be wrong
05:02 - for you a certain area and last but not
05:04 - least this is also no job promo it's an
05:07 - exchange so i'm here to share experience
05:10 - not to promote certain positions
05:14 - and with this being said
05:16 - let's then jump into the first
05:19 - piece here
05:20 - what to
05:22 - look at before you apply the position
05:25 - sorry sorry uh just just to really jump
05:27 - in really quickly because you put your
05:29 - um linkedin plug in there so
05:32 - um just to double check what are your
05:34 - boundaries can people add you can people
05:36 - follow you can people get in touch um
05:39 - about certain positions or applications
05:42 - like what's what are your boundaries
05:43 - here
05:44 - sure um so i shared also the the
05:47 - linkedin name so that you can also find
05:50 - me
05:50 - um please feel free to to reach out to
05:53 - me by a message
05:55 - um for for all kind of different topics
05:57 - if you're interested to learn more um
06:01 - and i think linkedin would be the best
06:02 - way to to reach out to me
06:07 - okay
06:09 - yeah so
06:11 - now let's imagine you're there you you
06:13 - did some studies in
06:15 - data science data engineering you um or
06:18 - you come from a different field and you
06:20 - enrich your knowledge by by doing
06:22 - um some some coding trainings
06:26 - and you're there thinking what what to
06:28 - do with your knowledge now
06:30 - and one important thing and this is
06:32 - pretty general for all positions but
06:34 - here specifically
06:36 - um
06:37 - you need to be clear for yourself what
06:40 - you are expecting from your job there
06:42 - will never ever be the one job that
06:44 - covers every every everything so when
06:47 - you select for positions you need first
06:49 - of all to think what is really important
06:51 - for yourself
06:52 - is it the salary which is on prior
06:54 - number one which is just perfectly fine
06:57 - um
06:58 - is it your development chances that
07:00 - really matter to you is it
07:03 - important to you that your job offers
07:04 - you the
07:05 - opportunity to learn new techniques new
07:07 - tools
07:08 - how important is the location um
07:11 - is it very interesting to you in which
07:14 - industry you are in or actually does the
07:16 - industry not matter and it's more about
07:18 - the content what you do
07:20 - or how much do you want to identify with
07:22 - the purpose of the company or
07:25 - or the task
07:27 - all those questions you should ask
07:29 - yourself
07:30 - beforehand because this is very
07:32 - important to be at the end
07:34 - happy in your in your role that you take
07:37 - and
07:38 - when you rank those parameters for
07:40 - yourselves you will also
07:42 - already answer a lot of
07:44 - questions like is it a big company you
07:47 - should join or is it more startup
07:50 - they are very different in in their
07:51 - mechanisms
07:53 - for instance if you want to have
07:55 - development chances within a company you
07:58 - should go for a big company where
07:59 - there's a lot of opportunities there to
08:01 - change within one company
08:03 - if it's more important to you to
08:06 - have more freedom within the task that
08:09 - you
08:10 - that you wanna that you wanna do maybe
08:12 - startup with flatter hierarchies is more
08:15 - suitable for you
08:16 - and one aspect i want to advertise for
08:19 - here do project as much as you can
08:22 - um because projects give you then the
08:24 - opportunity to understand more about
08:26 - yourself what kind of environment fits
08:28 - to you
08:31 - another aspect
08:33 - which you should consider before
08:35 - applying to a position is your personal
08:38 - stage of experience where you're at
08:40 - so
08:41 - when you're pretty young to the to the
08:43 - area of data science data engineering
08:45 - um
08:47 - i would recommend to look rather for
08:49 - teams that are already
08:51 - more established where you have maybe a
08:54 - senior data scientist who can teach you
08:56 - things
08:57 - where routines are in place
08:59 - so where the team is already running
09:01 - smoothly and you don't have to take care
09:04 - of such things and can really focus on
09:07 - doing your job and learning within your
09:08 - job if you're more experienced you can
09:12 - you know you can
09:13 - also join
09:15 - younger teams which are more in the
09:16 - build up phase because those teams will
09:18 - also offer you more opportunities to
09:20 - develop faster into let's say leadership
09:23 - positions for instance if you're
09:24 - building up new teams there's permanent
09:26 - growth and the demand for leaders
09:29 - right so this is something where you
09:30 - should figure out
09:32 - at which stage are you and what fits for
09:34 - you
09:35 - and again specifically if you're more in
09:37 - the first part so in the less
09:39 - experienced section i again advocate for
09:42 - do projects so what i mean by by project
09:45 - this can be
09:47 - literally
09:48 - anything which translates a real life
09:51 - problem
09:52 - into a coding or data science evaluation
09:56 - task so projects do not only help you to
09:59 - train your skills
10:01 - it also teaches you a lot about your own
10:03 - strengths and weaknesses
10:05 - it helps you to to learn this
10:07 - translation step from like the problem
10:10 - to what needs to be done
10:13 - and also helps you to
10:15 - zoom between those different levels so
10:18 - being able to speak about the high level
10:20 - purpose of the project as well about the
10:23 - deep dive
10:24 - how did you finally solve it so you
10:27 - learn also a lot of organizational
10:29 - aspects and how teamwork works when you
10:32 - want to get something done
10:34 - which is bigger than a one-man show
10:40 - okay so at this point i think
10:43 - i made the point how how important i
10:45 - think projects are when you're entering
10:48 - the job search and now let's say
10:51 - you found some some jobs you you
10:53 - reflected on yourself
10:55 - and you got invited to the interview
10:58 - so first of all the interview is a
11:00 - dialogue um sometimes people come to the
11:03 - interview and
11:05 - think they they are expected to be
11:07 - brilliant at everything um
11:10 - we're fully aware that
11:12 - people are people everybody has
11:13 - strengths and weaknesses and the
11:15 - interview is a dialogue where we can see
11:18 - whether our expectations meet so whether
11:20 - what we offer is what you expected and
11:23 - what you can offer fits to the job role
11:26 - we have
11:27 - so one thing i want to raise awareness
11:30 - for is
11:32 - people that you meet in the interview do
11:35 - not necessarily always need to be
11:38 - technically
11:40 - first and knowledgeable people take me
11:42 - for example i came from a from a
11:44 - completely different area
11:46 - uh and i'm also responsible to evaluate
11:51 - how you fit into your team or
11:54 - whether it works out so you should be
11:56 - aware of the fact that
11:58 - you do not only need to convince by your
12:00 - heart skills but you also need to
12:02 - convince people like me
12:04 - who
12:05 - rather want to understand
12:08 - what is the benefit of what you did
12:10 - did you really translate this this
12:12 - bigger problem into into the smaller
12:14 - pieces and find the solutions
12:16 - and here again what's really helpful the
12:18 - examples and the projects if you can
12:20 - tell about a story where you accomplish
12:23 - something based on a bigger problem
12:25 - that's very valuable to really
12:27 - understand
12:28 - how you think and how you translate
12:31 - those those issues and also here it's
12:34 - very important i said on the slide
12:35 - before to be able to translate between
12:37 - the high level idea
12:39 - and the deep dive how did you do it and
12:42 - and um
12:44 - how did you solve the issues this way
12:47 - um sorry sorry about it again um but can
12:50 - i just ask you sorry do you have any
12:53 - sort of cases any sort of stories
12:55 - without giving away personal information
12:56 - or any private information um did you
12:59 - ever have someone come in for an
13:01 - interview and they talked about a
13:03 - project that really impressed you
13:06 - a project that really impressed me so
13:09 - um
13:10 - i cannot give a specific one because um
13:14 - actually every interview covers at least
13:16 - give me one example and there are a lot
13:18 - of nice examples what mostly
13:22 - what i mostly enjoy to listen to are
13:24 - stories where people
13:26 - develop something on
13:28 - their own without having um
13:31 - a fixed framework so i also enjoy
13:33 - listening to i did in my master's thesis
13:35 - or i had an internship here
13:38 - but i really enjoyed those
13:40 - examples where people come up with
13:43 - a problem they're observed on their own
13:45 - for instance they are they have a hobby
13:47 - in a certain field and
13:50 - they realize this would be much better
13:52 - if i
13:53 - would be able to um
13:54 - [Music]
13:56 - to have more data in this and figure out
13:58 - certain certain aspects and then they
14:00 - just do something because it's valuable
14:02 - to them um and why do i enjoy those uh
14:06 - examples most because this has all the
14:08 - pieces of bringing a business case into
14:11 - a real solution yeah it's it's it shows
14:15 - me that you don't need
14:17 - to have like a
14:19 - pre-described
14:20 - problem where everything is is already
14:23 - described in detail but you can
14:25 - understand a real life problem and you
14:27 - just are also motivated on your own to
14:30 - find your solutions
14:32 - so those those tasks or those examples
14:34 - where someone translates something from
14:36 - a personal world and just looks for
14:38 - solutions that's very inspiring and i
14:40 - enjoy it a lot
14:45 - yeah and
14:46 - when we're in the interview of course
14:49 - besides uh non-techy people like myself
14:52 - of course mostly there's also someone
14:55 - who can evaluate the tech side there are
14:58 - companies who who use those kind of test
15:01 - mechanisms beforehand um
15:05 - for us it's it's
15:06 - more use
15:07 - or we use it
15:09 - more widely to really have the interview
15:11 - with a tech person because as we all
15:14 - know there are
15:15 - more than one way to to solve a problem
15:18 - and this is something you can figure out
15:20 - better in
15:22 - an interview with tech guys
15:24 - and here um one one thing which is
15:27 - important be honest and be
15:29 - the open
15:30 - um sometimes people are so so afraid not
15:34 - to make it through the interview that
15:36 - they start to try to oversell themselves
15:39 - and are not very honest about
15:42 - how much they did on their own
15:44 - i don't say that it's the majority
15:47 - for sure not
15:48 - but
15:49 - just to let you know
15:51 - we see this
15:53 - and even even if i'm not the tech person
15:55 - mostly even i see this when it becomes a
15:58 - little bit blurry and when people start
16:00 - to to be hesitant about describing what
16:02 - they did
16:03 - so be honest and say okay i'm not so
16:07 - uh knowledgeable in this part but i
16:10 - solve my problems using maybe the other
16:12 - language using another tools
16:14 - that's totally fine to say it's better
16:17 - to be clear about what you can do and
16:18 - what you cannot and also companies are
16:21 - very very open in
16:23 - giving you trainings so
16:25 - the typical example is
16:28 - when cloud experience is important
16:32 - it mostly doesn't matter whether it's
16:34 - azure or aws
16:37 - if you work in the cloud environment
16:39 - that's fine and if you need one of the
16:41 - other tools we'll train you no no
16:43 - worries but it's more important to be
16:45 - honest and open about what you can do
16:47 - and leave the impression of you being an
16:49 - honest person then trying to to um
16:54 - to pretend there is something which
16:55 - isn't there
16:58 - um how does it normally work do you have
17:00 - someone who is a non-technical person
17:02 - plus attack person at the same time or
17:04 - do you have them sort of at different
17:06 - internal intervals
17:08 - it depends it really depends
17:11 - um
17:12 - how the team is set up we have uh
17:15 - we had already both cases so um
17:18 - sometimes it's the tech person and and
17:21 - myself and then i mostly leave first of
17:23 - all the stage to the tech colleague
17:25 - because this is more the discussion that
17:27 - that needs to be also
17:29 - um
17:30 - have the room and the freedom to go into
17:33 - depth
17:34 - uh and then i add my questions which are
17:37 - more team and and soft skill correlated
17:39 - but there are also other cases where um
17:43 - for example the tech colleagues also
17:45 - develop a challenge um
17:47 - send the challenge prior to the
17:48 - interview so that the applicant has some
17:50 - time to work on it and then after let's
17:53 - say an hour the interview takes place
17:55 - and you can discuss the result what i
17:57 - really like about this approach is that
18:00 - the applicant also sees what are our
18:02 - problems
18:04 - because we develop the challenge
18:07 - and also it's not just um
18:09 - you hand in some code and then it's
18:11 - either right or wrong but you as an
18:13 - applicant also have the chance to
18:15 - describe why you chose this way why did
18:18 - you um
18:19 - select the
18:21 - why why did you do it the way you did it
18:23 - and i think that's that's nice if you
18:25 - have this dialog here
18:28 - yeah and last but not least
18:30 - you being there in the interview
18:32 - um
18:33 - be clear and honest as i already said so
18:36 - um
18:37 - tell us clearly what you bring to the
18:39 - table of course an interview is also
18:41 - about selling yourself so we be proud of
18:43 - what you did
18:45 - give us examples
18:48 - give us examples also where you
18:50 - struggled to achieve something but
18:52 - achieved it at the end
18:55 - and also tell us what's important to you
18:57 - um as i said there won't be the one
18:59 - position which is covering every every
19:02 - everything
19:03 - but if your expectations and what we can
19:07 - offer come close together
19:09 - then it's a good fit
19:13 - okay and
19:15 - now let's look at the third stage so
19:19 - you
19:19 - managed to go through the interview we
19:22 - got to know each other and now we think
19:23 - yeah that that will work out
19:25 - and um you're a part of our team
19:29 - then of course the dialogue continues
19:31 - and i want to um
19:33 - have a brief reflection on on two
19:35 - different aspects the one being the
19:37 - feedback culture
19:38 - and the other being the work culture
19:41 - um
19:42 - so feedback culture is something which
19:44 - is um
19:46 - i i don't know whether there are
19:47 - companies who would not value a good
19:50 - feedback culture and feedback always
19:51 - means
19:52 - feedback in both directions
19:55 - and for us specifically we have at least
19:58 - twice a year a dialogue between the
20:01 - manager and the employee where we also
20:03 - reflect on the personal strengths and
20:05 - weaknesses and where you can also
20:07 - address your
20:09 - your perception of your tasks and
20:12 - uh what fits better to you and where you
20:14 - would like to have some some more
20:16 - support
20:17 - and this is important in order to also
20:20 - shape your development path right
20:23 - you can be
20:25 - interested in digging deeper into into
20:27 - problems and learning more different
20:29 - tools different languages which is more
20:32 - an expert path
20:33 - or on the other hand side you can also
20:36 - be more generalistic um in in your
20:39 - skill set and be also more interested in
20:43 - leading things so this is a complete
20:45 - different development path and this is
20:47 - something we can just also figure out in
20:49 - the dialogue and with giving you
20:51 - feedback on how we perceive
20:53 - you in your job role
20:55 - and also um
20:58 - please address any kind of improvements
21:00 - and suggestions that you have in in the
21:02 - workplace so
21:04 - one important piece is this trainings
21:07 - you know best what kind of trainings you
21:10 - would need to do your job better so you
21:12 - need to address this to a manager and
21:14 - say hey i can solve those tasks but
21:16 - actually
21:17 - i would be also interested to learn this
21:19 - kind of tool sets because i think i
21:21 - could do the task even better and
21:24 - you're you're
21:25 - we're happy to hear this and you will
21:27 - get those trainings
21:29 - and also another part where you can
21:31 - always give feedback is also the kind of
21:32 - job organization so house
21:34 - the task distribution within the team
21:37 - those are always regular discussions
21:38 - that you should have with your manager
21:40 - so
21:41 - that we're aware of what you need and
21:44 - you are aware of what what we think of
21:46 - of your performance so far
21:49 - and um the second part of the slide the
21:52 - the work culture that's that's something
21:55 - pretty generic so i will just briefly
21:57 - briefly touch on those four pieces but
21:59 - this is basically how how this
22:02 - things work together you you have always
22:04 - an organizational component which is um
22:07 - very dependent on the company you're
22:09 - working for there's the cultural
22:11 - component which is correlated to the
22:14 - values of the company
22:16 - um there's always the team perspective
22:18 - and your individual role within the team
22:20 - so
22:21 - when you're looking also for jobs this
22:23 - is something you can also reflect on
22:25 - beforehand um
22:27 - look at the company you're applying to
22:28 - what are the values
22:30 - how do how is the structure
22:32 - um
22:33 - are you a big fan for flat hierarchies
22:35 - or are you okay with a more hierarchical
22:38 - structure this is something which will
22:41 - be important for your day-to-day life
22:43 - so to give you an example here big
22:45 - companies mostly have very s or
22:49 - more complicated processes so in order
22:51 - to to change something something big you
22:54 - will have to to get through a lot of
22:57 - process steps in a big company
23:00 - right so that's just something you have
23:01 - to be aware of and if you say that's
23:03 - um
23:04 - that's stressing to you
23:06 - maybe a smaller company or startup would
23:08 - be more suitable for you
23:10 - work culture as i said that's
23:12 - part of of of the values that a company
23:15 - has and this should also ideally be
23:17 - something you can identify with uh if
23:19 - you don't identify with the path and the
23:22 - strategy a company goes
23:24 - on the long term run
23:26 - this can be also stressful
23:29 - team setup
23:30 - this can be very very different and you
23:32 - should also reflect for yourself
23:35 - where you feel comfortable so is it for
23:36 - instance
23:38 - that you want to be part of mixed teams
23:40 - so where you have a lot of different
23:42 - profiles and you learn a lot from
23:44 - different people but where you also have
23:46 - to be very good at your job and explain
23:48 - it to others
23:49 - or would you rather prefer to be
23:51 - a data engineer among data engineers
23:54 - where you are where you have an easier
23:56 - living in
23:57 - in exchanging on
23:59 - on job specifics but you will not get so
24:02 - much from the outside perspective that's
24:04 - very individual and
24:05 - that's something you need to reflect on
24:08 - and the other points team fit so how do
24:10 - you communicate with your team
24:12 - colleagues does it feel comfortable
24:14 - natural
24:15 - work management um
24:17 - most
24:18 - jobs in the area of
24:20 - development engineering are working in
24:23 - an agile work mode but
24:25 - there will be of course also
24:30 - teams which are not structured in that
24:32 - way so you need also to see how this
24:34 - whole work mode fits with you and last
24:37 - but not least
24:38 - um always reflect on your hard skills
24:40 - ask for trainings if you need some
24:42 - um and also reflect on your soft skills
24:44 - so if you find yourself in a role where
24:47 - ex communication is expected and you're
24:50 - uncomfortable with that
24:51 - that's not the best situation so again
24:53 - you should talk to a manager whether
24:55 - it's
24:56 - whether it's some kind of training that
24:58 - can help you or whether there is also
25:01 - more
25:02 - back-end role that you could fit in
25:07 - and with this being said we're already
25:09 - already at the summary so
25:11 - in the beginning
25:13 - think about what's important for
25:14 - yourself
25:16 - articulate this clearly in the interview
25:18 - what are your strengths what you bring
25:19 - to the table what are you expecting
25:22 - and then continue the dialogue with your
25:25 - team and your manager
25:29 - so back to you laura
25:32 - all right um let's have a look look at
25:34 - um
25:36 - okay uh let me see if there's anyone who
25:38 - has questions
25:40 - um i think
25:43 - maybe people are still thinking about
25:44 - questions so maybe i'll just bump in and
25:47 - get my questions in first um
25:50 - so
25:50 - uh what i wanted to ask you sorry you
25:52 - having is a very academic sort of
25:54 - research background right
25:56 - was there anything that surprised you or
25:58 - anything that took you back when you
26:00 - started hiring
26:04 - anything surprising um
26:08 - yeah actually so
26:10 - i'm thinking now of an example um
26:12 - when hiring specifically for data
26:15 - analytics and data visualization
26:16 - positions
26:17 - i was surprised to see how many people
26:20 - apply coming from a different field and
26:23 - this was
26:24 - not only feels like i'm used to natural
26:27 - science
26:28 - um where you have also a clear connect
26:31 - to data but also very very different
26:33 - other fields from psychology social
26:35 - science
26:36 - uh languages um
26:39 - and on the one hand side i think that's
26:41 - that's a very good trend um
26:44 - as we see digitalization is is a big
26:47 - part in in all kind of different
26:48 - business functions
26:50 - so i think in the future we will need
26:52 - more and more people who are able to
26:55 - think cross-functionally so who combine
26:58 - this kind of
26:59 - specific business knowledge supply chain
27:01 - finance whatever
27:03 - with expertise how to work with data how
27:06 - to design the tools
27:08 - i think this is a very good trend on the
27:10 - other hand side
27:12 - why i was also so surprised is
27:15 - this transformation process from from
27:17 - one profile to
27:18 - to data science data analytics
27:22 - is not easy and i saw a lot of people
27:25 - who had
27:27 - one or two certificates um
27:30 - entry level of whatever
27:33 - and they expected to have this full-time
27:35 - position which is just focusing on data
27:38 - and this is unfortunately mostly not how
27:40 - it works
27:41 - um so be aware that this transformation
27:44 - process
27:45 - is challenging and i know this is again
27:47 - this kind of like hannah neck problem
27:49 - where people expect you to have
27:51 - experience but nobody gives you a job to
27:52 - gain experience
27:54 - so this is where i come again back to
27:56 - the point of the project you know
27:58 - certificates and then do the projects
28:01 - and when you are in the interview i see
28:03 - in your cv okay you did this kind of
28:05 - project and we can talk about it and
28:06 - then you can tell us um what did you do
28:09 - there why did you come up with this idea
28:11 - and you are much closer to the real job
28:14 - if you already had some kind of project
28:16 - where you had to translate this real
28:18 - life problems into a technical solution
28:22 - and your chances are much higher to be
28:23 - invited to the interview
28:25 - right
28:26 - um just looking at the questions so
28:29 - somebody's asking um does it matter if
28:31 - you have skill training or of yourself
28:32 - so i think that you just kind of
28:33 - answered that sorry
28:35 - um
28:36 - if you have those projects because of
28:38 - have that
28:39 - you know other things to back you up
28:42 - um like you say
28:43 - you know you don't have to be
28:45 - data science major all the way is that
28:47 - is that correct
28:49 - exactly exactly so uh
28:51 - let me also um give you here an example
28:53 - this specifically from from natural
28:55 - scientists um i see this quite
28:58 - frequently if you come from a background
29:01 - in physics
29:03 - where you had maybe some kind of
29:06 - molecular physics where you also use
29:09 - programming and coding languages and
29:11 - then you use this to jump more into this
29:15 - kind of coding profile and you started
29:17 - to do your own projects encoding etc
29:21 - i totally see why you want to have a job
29:23 - in this field
29:25 - regardless the fact that your cv says
29:27 - i'm a master of physics
29:30 - okay yep fair enough um
29:34 - somebody's asking the steps to learn
29:35 - data science um i feel like that's kind
29:38 - of a big question
29:41 - it is um and it really depends
29:44 - on your individual um
29:47 - case where you're coming from so as i
29:49 - said there are there are some
29:52 - some education paths some careers
29:55 - where you have already the contact with
29:57 - data and
29:58 - um you will maybe not need to have this
30:02 - certificate based um
30:04 - trainings but you more or less jump into
30:07 - this
30:08 - um
30:09 - if you if you're coming from from a
30:11 - completely different field i think
30:13 - coming
30:14 - starting with um uh
30:17 - yeah like like codecademy or udemy or
30:19 - whatever they're called so we're start
30:21 - with a platform that helps you it's it's
30:24 - it's really a good start because here
30:26 - you can first of all learn a couple of
30:28 - things
30:29 - understand what this whole topic is
30:30 - about and just step by step um enrich
30:34 - your your training
30:36 - um and then some people are asking about
30:38 - sort of hard skills and projects i think
30:40 - you kind of answered that earlier where
30:41 - you said um what you like to see so like
30:43 - a like a passion project like a sort of
30:46 - pet project and then sort of apply your
30:47 - skills to it
30:49 - um okay
30:51 - um
30:53 - so maybe also to comment on on hard
30:55 - skills so
30:56 - um
30:58 - this this now uh goes a bit to the area
31:00 - of cvs which
31:03 - i want to say again as a disclaimer it's
31:05 - there is no one-size-fits-all but what
31:08 - regularly and what's very helpful is
31:10 - when you have a summary of like the
31:13 - languages or the tools you used um some
31:16 - people also like to to rate themselves
31:18 - so
31:20 - uh like like in an amazon style from one
31:22 - to five how many points would i give
31:23 - myself
31:25 - um that's helpful for first um for first
31:28 - impression but then i would always look
31:30 - for
31:31 - what kind of tasks or project did you do
31:34 - where i can see where you
31:35 - used python so if it says python files
31:38 - then it would always look on your cv
31:40 - where does it come from
31:43 - right
31:45 - what drives you what are you doing why
31:47 - are you doing it um okay
31:49 - right um i feel like what you mentioned
31:51 - earlier where you said that people are
31:52 - coming from different disciplines and
31:54 - there's of um venturing into data and
31:57 - you say that you like that i feel like
31:58 - that's very encouraging to a lot of
32:00 - people
32:01 - um
32:02 - because it shows that even with a
32:04 - non-tech background you can still do it
32:06 - okay um
32:09 - all right important things that we can
32:11 - put on our resume to get call backs
32:14 - um i feel like you said earlier
32:16 - you're not gonna do
32:18 - resume feedback
32:20 - yeah so is that right um
32:23 - here i'm i'm a little bit hesitant
32:24 - because i cannot speak for being
32:27 - managers of the world and also here um
32:29 - the cultural aspect might be um might be
32:32 - very very different
32:34 - um
32:35 - but you will always have to
32:37 - have to be able to depict your heart
32:39 - skills whether it's now
32:42 - you have a list um
32:44 - where you rank yourself
32:46 - but or whether you just put the projects
32:49 - um
32:50 - the cv needs to be structured so even if
32:53 - i
32:54 - need to understand what you did and why
32:56 - this role might be interesting for you
32:58 - um
33:00 - some people like to put their github
33:01 - links that's that's also nice
33:04 - it shows that you're in this community
33:06 - um
33:07 - but those are now what i'm mentioning
33:09 - now this is something which i personally
33:11 - do and which i know some other managers
33:14 - also do but i wouldn't speak for
33:16 - everyone here
33:18 - right
33:19 - um so actually um since so many people
33:22 - are asking about non-technical
33:23 - backgrounds um would you maybe be able
33:26 - to comment on your own non-tech
33:28 - background
33:29 - so you being
33:31 - um
33:31 - very research focused um was it helpful
33:34 - or was it a hindrance at times i mean
33:37 - you still being in stem though
33:39 - yeah
33:40 - um
33:41 - that's an interesting question and i
33:43 - uh i actually think that
33:45 - having a background in natural science
33:47 - was actually very helpful
33:49 - um i see a lot of parallels between
33:52 - natural sciences and uh data science and
33:56 - and all kind of data related fields
33:59 - um
34:00 - what those fields have in common is that
34:02 - you need again to have the the
34:05 - understanding of a broad topic so you
34:07 - need to understand
34:09 - um
34:10 - how does cancer work and why is it bad
34:12 - and you need
34:14 - high level a business a business issue a
34:16 - business problem that needs to be solved
34:19 - but at the same time for both you need
34:20 - to be able to translate this down to a
34:23 - very very specific thing to do
34:26 - so even though i understood cancer is
34:29 - bad i need to know a lot of experiments
34:32 - and how they work and how they are done
34:34 - properly and i need to be able to do
34:36 - them properly in order to achieve some
34:38 - results so this would be the chemical
34:40 - perspective
34:41 - and when you work in an area with data
34:43 - you kind of have to say
34:45 - you first of all and don't underestimate
34:48 - that
34:49 - you have to figure out where to find the
34:50 - data
34:51 - and
34:53 - the statistics that's that's
34:54 - unfortunately true
34:56 - 80
34:57 - of the time of a data scientist are
34:59 - spent not by the actual data science but
35:02 - looking for the data doing the data
35:04 - cleansing and the data preparation
35:07 - so you need to do you need to be able to
35:10 - translate the business problem to where
35:12 - do i find the data how do i prepare the
35:14 - data and then comes the fancy part to
35:17 - generate the insights and translate them
35:19 - back to the picture right you need to
35:21 - explain this then back to the business
35:23 - guys why your insights are so valuable
35:26 - so i think there are a lot of parallels
35:29 - and as you said i i would totally
35:31 - encourage people who are interested in
35:34 - in changing their role into a data
35:35 - related role to do this i think there
35:38 - will be an even more growing market for
35:41 - this kind of profiles but be aware that
35:44 - this is a transformation process and
35:47 - not just done by two or three
35:48 - certificates
35:50 - yep
35:51 - um was there anything that you wish
35:53 - you'd known beforehand
35:56 - before starting as a manager
35:58 - that i
35:59 - wished i knew beforehand
36:03 - good question
36:06 - um
36:10 - i mean what would i enjoy um but i
36:13 - did not think would be
36:16 - so important is
36:18 - that you really need to be able to
36:21 - jump into new new perspectives
36:24 - and new problems very very fast
36:26 - um
36:26 - [Music]
36:28 - and that that also always implies that
36:30 - you need to
36:31 - leave behind your your own
36:34 - ideas and pre-assumptions
36:36 - um
36:38 - and
36:39 - take the other person's perspective to
36:40 - understand the way the other person
36:42 - thinks um
36:44 - i i hope this was kind of understandable
36:47 - if it's too blurry also
36:51 - no i just feel like um
36:53 - yeah no that's that's good yeah that's
36:54 - all good okay um we're kind of
36:58 - at the wrap-up stage let me just check
37:00 - any
37:01 - important questions um how many projects
37:04 - do you think people should bring to the
37:05 - table like what's what's a good number
37:07 - is that kind of difficult to say
37:09 - oh it depends on project apps
37:11 - difficult to say also because this um
37:14 - depends on the the job role that you're
37:16 - applying to
37:17 - so as i said in the beginning i'm now
37:19 - more focused on on those entry-level
37:21 - jobs
37:23 - where
37:24 - if you have a very interesting master
37:26 - thesis
37:28 - that's already a good description um
37:31 - the the higher the job
37:34 - position that that you're going to goes
37:37 - the higher the expectations of course
37:40 - okay okay um we're kind of at the
37:43 - wrap-up stage is there anything that you
37:44 - would like to
37:45 - sort of summarize anything you would
37:47 - like to say any parting parting remarks
37:50 - anything from fedor maybe
37:55 - uh no it was very informative
37:57 - you know i keep seeing
37:59 - parallels between data science and web
38:01 - development i talk to a lot of
38:02 - recruiters that work with
38:04 - uh juniors in web development and you
38:06 - know the disciplines are different but
38:08 - the principles sort of apply the same
38:10 - where they always say that you have to
38:12 - put an emphasis on building your own
38:13 - projects being very confident in your
38:15 - own code
38:16 - if you find the kind of interview where
38:19 - they send you a project to work on ahead
38:21 - of time you know spend as much time as
38:23 - you can in it
38:24 - make sure that you that you take the
38:26 - time and you know don't wait until the
38:28 - last moment to work on it of course take
38:30 - it seriously and also be very honest
38:33 - doing the interviews all the recruiters
38:35 - always say you know um
38:36 - to you know to give an example if you're
38:38 - working with a react that's a from the
38:40 - framework and you're not very confident
38:42 - with a certain part of the interviewer
38:43 - is asking you better to say
38:45 - i don't know for sure and explain your
38:47 - reasoning because at the end of the day
38:49 - what they interview especially for a
38:51 - junior developer role somebody that they
38:53 - understand is somebody that is growing
38:54 - into that role and developing
38:57 - into the career
38:59 - they really want to know how you think
39:01 - and how you approach problems more than
39:03 - the actual technical hardcore knowledge
39:06 - because you can learn that on the job
39:07 - you can learn that like week after week
39:10 - so i know that i've seen a lot of
39:12 - parallels between what dr cattle is
39:13 - saying and and our own recruiters saying
39:16 - you know we really want to see people
39:18 - a junior but when they apply for junior
39:20 - roles
39:21 - showing that and demonstrating that they
39:23 - can learn that they're really
39:25 - you know eager to learn and they're very
39:27 - passionate about the subject
39:30 - totally so laura this this was actually
39:32 - the summary i i couldn't summarize it
39:34 - better
39:37 - thanks very much be willing to learn and
39:40 - and shows that you're that you're able
39:42 - to jump into new topics and again this
39:44 - is also something which is becoming more
39:46 - and more valuable in our in our world
39:48 - today um
39:50 - whatever you learned yesterday might be
39:52 - obsolete tomorrow so it's way more
39:54 - important that you are curious to jump
39:56 - into those new topics and that you're
39:58 - eager to learn
40:03 - okay so we are
40:05 - down for today i think laura is that
40:07 - correct
40:08 - all right well thank you everybody for
40:10 - stopping by uh it's been you know i've
40:13 - had a good time listening to the dr cad
40:16 - there's always something to learn always
40:17 - a new perspective to learn uh when
40:19 - you're applying for jobs and when you're
40:20 - trying to learn you know interviews and
40:22 - the whole intricacies i think a good
40:24 - point was saying that every company is a
40:27 - little different so be mindful of what
40:29 - you're applying your country your
40:30 - culture your background there's always a
40:33 - lot of details that go into this and you
40:35 - have to be persistent i always apply and
40:37 - sometimes people get it at the first try
40:39 - sometimes you have to apply for 100
40:41 - different roles
40:42 - just be consistent and be persistent
40:44 - thank you everybody and we'll see you in
40:46 - our next live stream have a good weekend
40:50 - thank you
40:55 - and that's it

Cleaned transcript:

everybody i'm going to pass it on to laura and feel free to introduce yourselves hi everyone welcome to the stream my name is laura i'm the chapter leaper called academy soul and i'm here with fedor who's the community manager for cool academy our guest today is dr katharina groga or dr kat for short dr cat graduated with a phd in chemistry from the humboldt university of berlin in 2018 and she started working for basf a year prior since then dr cat has gained a wealth of experience as a manager some of which she would like to share with us today welcome dr cat and thanks for joining over to you yeah thank both of you thanks peter thanks laura and also thanks for the opportunity to share my expertise with you in this in this round i'm diving in from berlin germany right now and before i also jump into the topic i also comment a little bit about why i'm so interested to talk about this this topic and why is it so so close to my heart so the topic about what do employers look for in a data scientist or also in a data engineer so i also prepared some slides so i start sharing the screen so that we can follow also the logic of the talk together so i hope you can see my screen now maybe this is a brief introduction um about myself thanks laura um yeah as already introduced i'm located here in berlin germany and actually i did my thesis and and also my studies in the area of chemistry more specific by organic chemistry which does not sound like the easiest topic to now go to data science but i come to it in a minute why data science data engineering is so interesting to me with my background in chemistry i joined bsf as one of the biggest chemical companies in the world directly after my studies and within my time with bsf i changed a couple of positions so while starting in data management for chemical data i then switched to as large just mentioned to the role of becoming also hiring manager for other profiles than just the chemical process so starting with data management i was also working as disciplinary leader for topics of profiles in the area of data science data engineering but also developers and during this time i really enjoy working with with data scientist data engineers but some experiences during the interviews made me think whether it wouldn't be valuable to share some thoughts and some experiences that i gained with especially young people who want to enter this area and this is why this occasion and this talk is so close to my heart because this is the option and the opportunity to do so so what's the talk about i switch to the next and what it's not about so i see this as an opportunity to share my experiences so i will also talk as me as a private person so even though i made a lot of experience in the job context with bsf i'm not here to speak as a representative of the company i'm here as a private person to share my experience and three steps or three stages are relevant here so ideas you should have and and thoughts you should make before the job interview the job interview itself and also what's important in this area when you are in your work environment so the title says what do employers look for a data scientist but also as i said and mentioned um my experience is not only based on data science but also data engineering development so this is more like broad term for all this kind of i.t and data related profiles however i'm more focusing on junior positions so i hope this is also something which um you as an audience are more interested in it also just um comes with with the simple fact that i am more hiring in the junior profile area and also questions are highly welcome we'll have a q a section at the end but also um laura feder feel free to jump in and ask questions if you if you feel like it also to clarify what it's not about i will not talk about prioritizing any kind of specific languages or coding skills this is very individual for every employer and every position um if you want to really make sure that the position you apply for is covering or is in alignment with your skill set read the job office or call the recruiting team and ask them so i will not do prioritization here also i will not comment on cvs cvs are very regional specific so any piece of advice i would give here might be wrong for you a certain area and last but not least this is also no job promo it's an exchange so i'm here to share experience not to promote certain positions and with this being said let's then jump into the first piece here what to look at before you apply the position sorry sorry uh just just to really jump in really quickly because you put your um linkedin plug in there so um just to double check what are your boundaries can people add you can people follow you can people get in touch um about certain positions or applications like what's what are your boundaries here sure um so i shared also the the linkedin name so that you can also find me um please feel free to to reach out to me by a message um for for all kind of different topics if you're interested to learn more um and i think linkedin would be the best way to to reach out to me okay yeah so now let's imagine you're there you you did some studies in data science data engineering you um or you come from a different field and you enrich your knowledge by by doing um some some coding trainings and you're there thinking what what to do with your knowledge now and one important thing and this is pretty general for all positions but here specifically um you need to be clear for yourself what you are expecting from your job there will never ever be the one job that covers every every everything so when you select for positions you need first of all to think what is really important for yourself is it the salary which is on prior number one which is just perfectly fine um is it your development chances that really matter to you is it important to you that your job offers you the opportunity to learn new techniques new tools how important is the location um is it very interesting to you in which industry you are in or actually does the industry not matter and it's more about the content what you do or how much do you want to identify with the purpose of the company or or the task all those questions you should ask yourself beforehand because this is very important to be at the end happy in your in your role that you take and when you rank those parameters for yourselves you will also already answer a lot of questions like is it a big company you should join or is it more startup they are very different in in their mechanisms for instance if you want to have development chances within a company you should go for a big company where there's a lot of opportunities there to change within one company if it's more important to you to have more freedom within the task that you that you wanna that you wanna do maybe startup with flatter hierarchies is more suitable for you and one aspect i want to advertise for here do project as much as you can um because projects give you then the opportunity to understand more about yourself what kind of environment fits to you another aspect which you should consider before applying to a position is your personal stage of experience where you're at so when you're pretty young to the to the area of data science data engineering um i would recommend to look rather for teams that are already more established where you have maybe a senior data scientist who can teach you things where routines are in place so where the team is already running smoothly and you don't have to take care of such things and can really focus on doing your job and learning within your job if you're more experienced you can you know you can also join younger teams which are more in the build up phase because those teams will also offer you more opportunities to develop faster into let's say leadership positions for instance if you're building up new teams there's permanent growth and the demand for leaders right so this is something where you should figure out at which stage are you and what fits for you and again specifically if you're more in the first part so in the less experienced section i again advocate for do projects so what i mean by by project this can be literally anything which translates a real life problem into a coding or data science evaluation task so projects do not only help you to train your skills it also teaches you a lot about your own strengths and weaknesses it helps you to to learn this translation step from like the problem to what needs to be done and also helps you to zoom between those different levels so being able to speak about the high level purpose of the project as well about the deep dive how did you finally solve it so you learn also a lot of organizational aspects and how teamwork works when you want to get something done which is bigger than a oneman show okay so at this point i think i made the point how how important i think projects are when you're entering the job search and now let's say you found some some jobs you you reflected on yourself and you got invited to the interview so first of all the interview is a dialogue um sometimes people come to the interview and think they they are expected to be brilliant at everything um we're fully aware that people are people everybody has strengths and weaknesses and the interview is a dialogue where we can see whether our expectations meet so whether what we offer is what you expected and what you can offer fits to the job role we have so one thing i want to raise awareness for is people that you meet in the interview do not necessarily always need to be technically first and knowledgeable people take me for example i came from a from a completely different area uh and i'm also responsible to evaluate how you fit into your team or whether it works out so you should be aware of the fact that you do not only need to convince by your heart skills but you also need to convince people like me who rather want to understand what is the benefit of what you did did you really translate this this bigger problem into into the smaller pieces and find the solutions and here again what's really helpful the examples and the projects if you can tell about a story where you accomplish something based on a bigger problem that's very valuable to really understand how you think and how you translate those those issues and also here it's very important i said on the slide before to be able to translate between the high level idea and the deep dive how did you do it and and um how did you solve the issues this way um sorry sorry about it again um but can i just ask you sorry do you have any sort of cases any sort of stories without giving away personal information or any private information um did you ever have someone come in for an interview and they talked about a project that really impressed you a project that really impressed me so um i cannot give a specific one because um actually every interview covers at least give me one example and there are a lot of nice examples what mostly what i mostly enjoy to listen to are stories where people develop something on their own without having um a fixed framework so i also enjoy listening to i did in my master's thesis or i had an internship here but i really enjoyed those examples where people come up with a problem they're observed on their own for instance they are they have a hobby in a certain field and they realize this would be much better if i would be able to um to have more data in this and figure out certain certain aspects and then they just do something because it's valuable to them um and why do i enjoy those uh examples most because this has all the pieces of bringing a business case into a real solution yeah it's it's it shows me that you don't need to have like a predescribed problem where everything is is already described in detail but you can understand a real life problem and you just are also motivated on your own to find your solutions so those those tasks or those examples where someone translates something from a personal world and just looks for solutions that's very inspiring and i enjoy it a lot yeah and when we're in the interview of course besides uh nontechy people like myself of course mostly there's also someone who can evaluate the tech side there are companies who who use those kind of test mechanisms beforehand um for us it's it's more use or we use it more widely to really have the interview with a tech person because as we all know there are more than one way to to solve a problem and this is something you can figure out better in an interview with tech guys and here um one one thing which is important be honest and be the open um sometimes people are so so afraid not to make it through the interview that they start to try to oversell themselves and are not very honest about how much they did on their own i don't say that it's the majority for sure not but just to let you know we see this and even even if i'm not the tech person mostly even i see this when it becomes a little bit blurry and when people start to to be hesitant about describing what they did so be honest and say okay i'm not so uh knowledgeable in this part but i solve my problems using maybe the other language using another tools that's totally fine to say it's better to be clear about what you can do and what you cannot and also companies are very very open in giving you trainings so the typical example is when cloud experience is important it mostly doesn't matter whether it's azure or aws if you work in the cloud environment that's fine and if you need one of the other tools we'll train you no no worries but it's more important to be honest and open about what you can do and leave the impression of you being an honest person then trying to to um to pretend there is something which isn't there um how does it normally work do you have someone who is a nontechnical person plus attack person at the same time or do you have them sort of at different internal intervals it depends it really depends um how the team is set up we have uh we had already both cases so um sometimes it's the tech person and and myself and then i mostly leave first of all the stage to the tech colleague because this is more the discussion that that needs to be also um have the room and the freedom to go into depth uh and then i add my questions which are more team and and soft skill correlated but there are also other cases where um for example the tech colleagues also develop a challenge um send the challenge prior to the interview so that the applicant has some time to work on it and then after let's say an hour the interview takes place and you can discuss the result what i really like about this approach is that the applicant also sees what are our problems because we develop the challenge and also it's not just um you hand in some code and then it's either right or wrong but you as an applicant also have the chance to describe why you chose this way why did you um select the why why did you do it the way you did it and i think that's that's nice if you have this dialog here yeah and last but not least you being there in the interview um be clear and honest as i already said so um tell us clearly what you bring to the table of course an interview is also about selling yourself so we be proud of what you did give us examples give us examples also where you struggled to achieve something but achieved it at the end and also tell us what's important to you um as i said there won't be the one position which is covering every every everything but if your expectations and what we can offer come close together then it's a good fit okay and now let's look at the third stage so you managed to go through the interview we got to know each other and now we think yeah that that will work out and um you're a part of our team then of course the dialogue continues and i want to um have a brief reflection on on two different aspects the one being the feedback culture and the other being the work culture um so feedback culture is something which is um i i don't know whether there are companies who would not value a good feedback culture and feedback always means feedback in both directions and for us specifically we have at least twice a year a dialogue between the manager and the employee where we also reflect on the personal strengths and weaknesses and where you can also address your your perception of your tasks and uh what fits better to you and where you would like to have some some more support and this is important in order to also shape your development path right you can be interested in digging deeper into into problems and learning more different tools different languages which is more an expert path or on the other hand side you can also be more generalistic um in in your skill set and be also more interested in leading things so this is a complete different development path and this is something we can just also figure out in the dialogue and with giving you feedback on how we perceive you in your job role and also um please address any kind of improvements and suggestions that you have in in the workplace so one important piece is this trainings you know best what kind of trainings you would need to do your job better so you need to address this to a manager and say hey i can solve those tasks but actually i would be also interested to learn this kind of tool sets because i think i could do the task even better and you're you're we're happy to hear this and you will get those trainings and also another part where you can always give feedback is also the kind of job organization so house the task distribution within the team those are always regular discussions that you should have with your manager so that we're aware of what you need and you are aware of what what we think of of your performance so far and um the second part of the slide the the work culture that's that's something pretty generic so i will just briefly briefly touch on those four pieces but this is basically how how this things work together you you have always an organizational component which is um very dependent on the company you're working for there's the cultural component which is correlated to the values of the company um there's always the team perspective and your individual role within the team so when you're looking also for jobs this is something you can also reflect on beforehand um look at the company you're applying to what are the values how do how is the structure um are you a big fan for flat hierarchies or are you okay with a more hierarchical structure this is something which will be important for your daytoday life so to give you an example here big companies mostly have very s or more complicated processes so in order to to change something something big you will have to to get through a lot of process steps in a big company right so that's just something you have to be aware of and if you say that's um that's stressing to you maybe a smaller company or startup would be more suitable for you work culture as i said that's part of of of the values that a company has and this should also ideally be something you can identify with uh if you don't identify with the path and the strategy a company goes on the long term run this can be also stressful team setup this can be very very different and you should also reflect for yourself where you feel comfortable so is it for instance that you want to be part of mixed teams so where you have a lot of different profiles and you learn a lot from different people but where you also have to be very good at your job and explain it to others or would you rather prefer to be a data engineer among data engineers where you are where you have an easier living in in exchanging on on job specifics but you will not get so much from the outside perspective that's very individual and that's something you need to reflect on and the other points team fit so how do you communicate with your team colleagues does it feel comfortable natural work management um most jobs in the area of development engineering are working in an agile work mode but there will be of course also teams which are not structured in that way so you need also to see how this whole work mode fits with you and last but not least um always reflect on your hard skills ask for trainings if you need some um and also reflect on your soft skills so if you find yourself in a role where ex communication is expected and you're uncomfortable with that that's not the best situation so again you should talk to a manager whether it's whether it's some kind of training that can help you or whether there is also more backend role that you could fit in and with this being said we're already already at the summary so in the beginning think about what's important for yourself articulate this clearly in the interview what are your strengths what you bring to the table what are you expecting and then continue the dialogue with your team and your manager so back to you laura all right um let's have a look look at um okay uh let me see if there's anyone who has questions um i think maybe people are still thinking about questions so maybe i'll just bump in and get my questions in first um so uh what i wanted to ask you sorry you having is a very academic sort of research background right was there anything that surprised you or anything that took you back when you started hiring anything surprising um yeah actually so i'm thinking now of an example um when hiring specifically for data analytics and data visualization positions i was surprised to see how many people apply coming from a different field and this was not only feels like i'm used to natural science um where you have also a clear connect to data but also very very different other fields from psychology social science uh languages um and on the one hand side i think that's that's a very good trend um as we see digitalization is is a big part in in all kind of different business functions so i think in the future we will need more and more people who are able to think crossfunctionally so who combine this kind of specific business knowledge supply chain finance whatever with expertise how to work with data how to design the tools i think this is a very good trend on the other hand side why i was also so surprised is this transformation process from from one profile to to data science data analytics is not easy and i saw a lot of people who had one or two certificates um entry level of whatever and they expected to have this fulltime position which is just focusing on data and this is unfortunately mostly not how it works um so be aware that this transformation process is challenging and i know this is again this kind of like hannah neck problem where people expect you to have experience but nobody gives you a job to gain experience so this is where i come again back to the point of the project you know certificates and then do the projects and when you are in the interview i see in your cv okay you did this kind of project and we can talk about it and then you can tell us um what did you do there why did you come up with this idea and you are much closer to the real job if you already had some kind of project where you had to translate this real life problems into a technical solution and your chances are much higher to be invited to the interview right um just looking at the questions so somebody's asking um does it matter if you have skill training or of yourself so i think that you just kind of answered that sorry um if you have those projects because of have that you know other things to back you up um like you say you know you don't have to be data science major all the way is that is that correct exactly exactly so uh let me also um give you here an example this specifically from from natural scientists um i see this quite frequently if you come from a background in physics where you had maybe some kind of molecular physics where you also use programming and coding languages and then you use this to jump more into this kind of coding profile and you started to do your own projects encoding etc i totally see why you want to have a job in this field regardless the fact that your cv says i'm a master of physics okay yep fair enough um somebody's asking the steps to learn data science um i feel like that's kind of a big question it is um and it really depends on your individual um case where you're coming from so as i said there are there are some some education paths some careers where you have already the contact with data and um you will maybe not need to have this certificate based um trainings but you more or less jump into this um if you if you're coming from from a completely different field i think coming starting with um uh yeah like like codecademy or udemy or whatever they're called so we're start with a platform that helps you it's it's it's really a good start because here you can first of all learn a couple of things understand what this whole topic is about and just step by step um enrich your your training um and then some people are asking about sort of hard skills and projects i think you kind of answered that earlier where you said um what you like to see so like a like a passion project like a sort of pet project and then sort of apply your skills to it um okay um so maybe also to comment on on hard skills so um this this now uh goes a bit to the area of cvs which i want to say again as a disclaimer it's there is no onesizefitsall but what regularly and what's very helpful is when you have a summary of like the languages or the tools you used um some people also like to to rate themselves so uh like like in an amazon style from one to five how many points would i give myself um that's helpful for first um for first impression but then i would always look for what kind of tasks or project did you do where i can see where you used python so if it says python files then it would always look on your cv where does it come from right what drives you what are you doing why are you doing it um okay right um i feel like what you mentioned earlier where you said that people are coming from different disciplines and there's of um venturing into data and you say that you like that i feel like that's very encouraging to a lot of people um because it shows that even with a nontech background you can still do it okay um all right important things that we can put on our resume to get call backs um i feel like you said earlier you're not gonna do resume feedback yeah so is that right um here i'm i'm a little bit hesitant because i cannot speak for being managers of the world and also here um the cultural aspect might be um might be very very different um but you will always have to have to be able to depict your heart skills whether it's now you have a list um where you rank yourself but or whether you just put the projects um the cv needs to be structured so even if i need to understand what you did and why this role might be interesting for you um some people like to put their github links that's that's also nice it shows that you're in this community um but those are now what i'm mentioning now this is something which i personally do and which i know some other managers also do but i wouldn't speak for everyone here right um so actually um since so many people are asking about nontechnical backgrounds um would you maybe be able to comment on your own nontech background so you being um very research focused um was it helpful or was it a hindrance at times i mean you still being in stem though yeah um that's an interesting question and i uh i actually think that having a background in natural science was actually very helpful um i see a lot of parallels between natural sciences and uh data science and and all kind of data related fields um what those fields have in common is that you need again to have the the understanding of a broad topic so you need to understand um how does cancer work and why is it bad and you need high level a business a business issue a business problem that needs to be solved but at the same time for both you need to be able to translate this down to a very very specific thing to do so even though i understood cancer is bad i need to know a lot of experiments and how they work and how they are done properly and i need to be able to do them properly in order to achieve some results so this would be the chemical perspective and when you work in an area with data you kind of have to say you first of all and don't underestimate that you have to figure out where to find the data and the statistics that's that's unfortunately true 80 of the time of a data scientist are spent not by the actual data science but looking for the data doing the data cleansing and the data preparation so you need to do you need to be able to translate the business problem to where do i find the data how do i prepare the data and then comes the fancy part to generate the insights and translate them back to the picture right you need to explain this then back to the business guys why your insights are so valuable so i think there are a lot of parallels and as you said i i would totally encourage people who are interested in in changing their role into a data related role to do this i think there will be an even more growing market for this kind of profiles but be aware that this is a transformation process and not just done by two or three certificates yep um was there anything that you wish you'd known beforehand before starting as a manager that i wished i knew beforehand good question um i mean what would i enjoy um but i did not think would be so important is that you really need to be able to jump into new new perspectives and new problems very very fast um and that that also always implies that you need to leave behind your your own ideas and preassumptions um and take the other person's perspective to understand the way the other person thinks um i i hope this was kind of understandable if it's too blurry also no i just feel like um yeah no that's that's good yeah that's all good okay um we're kind of at the wrapup stage let me just check any important questions um how many projects do you think people should bring to the table like what's what's a good number is that kind of difficult to say oh it depends on project apps difficult to say also because this um depends on the the job role that you're applying to so as i said in the beginning i'm now more focused on on those entrylevel jobs where if you have a very interesting master thesis that's already a good description um the the higher the job position that that you're going to goes the higher the expectations of course okay okay um we're kind of at the wrapup stage is there anything that you would like to sort of summarize anything you would like to say any parting parting remarks anything from fedor maybe uh no it was very informative you know i keep seeing parallels between data science and web development i talk to a lot of recruiters that work with uh juniors in web development and you know the disciplines are different but the principles sort of apply the same where they always say that you have to put an emphasis on building your own projects being very confident in your own code if you find the kind of interview where they send you a project to work on ahead of time you know spend as much time as you can in it make sure that you that you take the time and you know don't wait until the last moment to work on it of course take it seriously and also be very honest doing the interviews all the recruiters always say you know um to you know to give an example if you're working with a react that's a from the framework and you're not very confident with a certain part of the interviewer is asking you better to say i don't know for sure and explain your reasoning because at the end of the day what they interview especially for a junior developer role somebody that they understand is somebody that is growing into that role and developing into the career they really want to know how you think and how you approach problems more than the actual technical hardcore knowledge because you can learn that on the job you can learn that like week after week so i know that i've seen a lot of parallels between what dr cattle is saying and and our own recruiters saying you know we really want to see people a junior but when they apply for junior roles showing that and demonstrating that they can learn that they're really you know eager to learn and they're very passionate about the subject totally so laura this this was actually the summary i i couldn't summarize it better thanks very much be willing to learn and and shows that you're that you're able to jump into new topics and again this is also something which is becoming more and more valuable in our in our world today um whatever you learned yesterday might be obsolete tomorrow so it's way more important that you are curious to jump into those new topics and that you're eager to learn okay so we are down for today i think laura is that correct all right well thank you everybody for stopping by uh it's been you know i've had a good time listening to the dr cad there's always something to learn always a new perspective to learn uh when you're applying for jobs and when you're trying to learn you know interviews and the whole intricacies i think a good point was saying that every company is a little different so be mindful of what you're applying your country your culture your background there's always a lot of details that go into this and you have to be persistent i always apply and sometimes people get it at the first try sometimes you have to apply for 100 different roles just be consistent and be persistent thank you everybody and we'll see you in our next live stream have a good weekend thank you and that's it
