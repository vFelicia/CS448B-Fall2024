00:01 - foreign
00:08 - hello hey everyone welcome back to this
00:12 - final live stream in our three-part
00:14 - journey through code Academy's Evolution
00:17 - today we're looking at one of our brand
00:19 - new courses intro to generative AI I'm
00:23 - Corey c code Academy's content marketing
00:25 - manager and I'm joined by Betty Garcia
00:27 - Lorca our community manager who you
00:30 - probably recognize from these live
00:31 - streams and forums and Discord as well
00:34 - as Adam Herman curriculum manager at
00:37 - code academy who will be walking us
00:39 - through this lesson and then over in the
00:41 - chat we have Alicia grama a senior
00:43 - curriculum developer who is on hand to
00:45 - answer all of your questions live
00:48 - so in case you haven't heard it's code
00:50 - Academy's birthday tomorrow we're
00:52 - turning 12 almost a teenager
00:56 - um the tech world has has changed a lot
00:58 - since we started out in 2011 and one of
01:02 - the biggest Transformations happened
01:03 - just last year when the research company
01:06 - opened AI launched the generative AI
01:08 - chatbot chat GPT and I'm curious how
01:11 - many of you here use Chachi BT to code
01:14 - or for work or just for fun let us know
01:17 - in the chat
01:18 - we recently launched a bunch of brand
01:21 - new AI courses and case studies that'll
01:24 - teach you how to use and build AI
01:26 - systems like these in a thoughtful
01:29 - responsible and inventive way uh but
01:33 - today Adam's going to show us how to
01:35 - make an original children's book with
01:38 - generative AI using our free beginner
01:41 - friendly course intro to generative AI
01:43 - as a guide this is a fun use for AI but
01:46 - it's also a very practical one if you
01:48 - say need some more bedtime stories in
01:51 - your rotation or you're a teacher of
01:53 - young children or you just need a clever
01:55 - gift idea for a kid in your life but
01:59 - keep in mind that you can go and take
02:01 - this course whenever you want on your
02:02 - own time and it's linked in the
02:03 - description below
02:05 - before we get into it let me tell you a
02:07 - little bit about Adam he started as a
02:10 - classroom teacher before moving in to
02:12 - Tech and now he's the curriculum manager
02:14 - at codecademy where he does strategy
02:16 - work for articles and code academy docs
02:19 - and has recently been working on
02:21 - producing new generative AI content for
02:24 - us hi Adam
02:26 - hey Corey hey
02:28 - I wanted to ask you a question before
02:30 - you jump into it
02:32 - um do you use generative AI Tools in
02:36 - your daily life and if so how
02:39 - that is a great question Corey so
02:42 - I think what's so interesting in general
02:44 - about like this moment with chair and of
02:46 - AI is that we are
02:48 - in kind of like a state of play with it
02:51 - of this is such a different cool
02:55 - interesting technology and we are still
02:59 - constantly finding new ways of
03:02 - integrating it both into our work lives
03:05 - and into our personal lives and
03:07 - something that was uh really drove this
03:10 - home for me was
03:12 - um like a month or two months ago I
03:16 - I am a fairly mediocre Chef
03:19 - um but I I try and I wanted to make a
03:24 - meat sauce and I was very intimidated so
03:28 - I went to Chachi BT and I said you know
03:31 - I'm a beginner level Chef I want to make
03:33 - a meat sauce I want to be this many
03:35 - servings what do I do and it spit out a
03:39 - whole recipe for me
03:41 - and the part where it got really really
03:44 - cool was I can then ask okay well how do
03:48 - I get oil out then or how do I chop the
03:51 - garlic pasta properly so you could keep
03:54 - digging in in a way that you don't get
03:57 - with things like a Search tool or other
03:59 - research tools
04:01 - and it is okay that's what I'm wanting
04:05 - to know surprisingly yes
04:07 - um there is a screenshot that thank you
04:10 - for asking um there's a screenshot of
04:11 - the recipe on my phone I'm very proud of
04:14 - it
04:15 - um so yes the the robot had good taste
04:19 - in food somehow
04:21 - love it thank you and that's the kind of
04:25 - thinking
04:27 - I think we're all working on and
04:28 - something I hope to encourage in all of
04:31 - you from today is not just what can
04:33 - these Technologies do it's how can they
04:35 - interact with each other how can they
04:37 - interact with our lives to change how we
04:40 - work and interact
04:43 - so go I'm going to share my screen with
04:45 - all of you
04:51 - and let's get into this course we'll be
04:54 - going through
04:59 - so the course is intro to generated Ai
05:02 - and
05:04 - as the name implies this is a
05:07 - introductory course going through
05:09 - different
05:11 - types of generative AI tooling and how
05:14 - people are using it we'll also be going
05:17 - into as Corey implied earlier
05:20 - how to use this technology responsibly
05:23 - and some of the interesting ethical
05:26 - conversations happening in this space
05:28 - right now
05:30 - I am not going to go too much into how
05:33 - to program with serendive AI we do have
05:35 - a lot of really great content around
05:37 - that that this is more for people
05:39 - looking to see what this technology is
05:43 - and how people are using it
05:50 - so why are we going to cover
05:52 - we're going to be doing an intro to the
05:55 - course and what it is
05:58 - I'll be going into this generative AI
06:02 - content workflow so I'll be showing you
06:04 - as I create this children's story how
06:07 - these different Technologies can be used
06:09 - together and what responsibilities we
06:12 - have as human users to make sure that
06:14 - the content is accurate and safe
06:18 - and as well as going into those ethical
06:21 - considerations I talked about before and
06:23 - then finally we're going to do a wrap up
06:25 - with some q a between myself and FedEx
06:31 - so over this you should be learning what
06:34 - generative AI is the different types of
06:37 - generative AI in their use cases and as
06:39 - I said before those ethical concerns and
06:42 - considerations
06:43 - so let's hop into the course so the
06:47 - course as I said is intro to generative
06:51 - AI
06:52 - and the author of this course Alicia
06:56 - grama is actually in the chat uh here
07:00 - today so she's here to answer any
07:03 - specific questions you may have about
07:06 - the course content
07:08 - so before anything else just what is
07:11 - generative AI
07:14 - um generative AI is
07:16 - a very Advanced learning uh model that
07:22 - uses that is trained on millions of
07:26 - different texts images uh code samples
07:30 - and what is more than anything is a
07:33 - synthesizer so it can take all of that
07:35 - information look for certain patterns
07:38 - and create an output
07:40 - system
07:42 - so to address the first thing is is it
07:45 - intelligent depends how you define
07:47 - intelligence uh a generative AI could
07:50 - not create something wholly new per se
07:54 - what it does is create
07:57 - an amalgamation
07:59 - of other things that have been input
08:01 - into it
08:02 - if you want to get philosophical about
08:04 - it that's everything that anyone makes
08:07 - is that but obviously it doesn't make it
08:10 - in a self-conscious way which is
08:12 - arguably where that
08:15 - intelligence happens but
08:19 - um whether or not it's AI it is really
08:21 - cool and very inventive and efficient in
08:25 - what it can do
08:27 - and what we're trying to figure out is
08:30 - at what point does the work that the AI
08:33 - can do end and human work begins and how
08:37 - I typically have learned to divide it
08:39 - there's a uh great book called range uh
08:44 - by an author named David Epstein and he
08:48 - talks about the difference between kind
08:51 - systems and wicked systems a kind system
08:54 - is something like uh chess it's
08:58 - something like uh maybe
09:01 - um
09:02 - certain types of legal work where
09:05 - it's happening within a very set system
09:08 - in which there are defined rules uh AI
09:12 - do very very well in kind system problem
09:16 - solving it's why AI
09:18 - um initially when I came onto the scene
09:20 - one of the most high profile things it
09:21 - could do was play chess
09:24 - uh humans are very good at Wicked
09:27 - problems they are good at high level
09:30 - strategy taking disparate pieces
09:32 - information and creating
09:35 - something cohesive out of it
09:37 - so throughout this I'll be showing you
09:39 - how to use AI to get to a point that you
09:43 - can begin as a human iterating on what
09:46 - you're using and making it something
09:47 - wholly better in original and suited to
09:50 - your purposes
09:52 - foreign
09:58 - so the first thing uh we'll be talking
10:00 - about is text-based generative AI this
10:03 - is probably the most famous or
10:06 - splashiest of the technologies that
10:09 - we've seen
10:10 - uh most famously chat gbt but there are
10:12 - also resources like bards that you can
10:15 - use I'll point out that within this
10:18 - course we have a fake GPT that uh we
10:21 - have a really brilliant interactive
10:24 - developer named Wesley on the team who
10:27 - made this for us and it simulates chat
10:29 - TBT right in our learning environment so
10:32 - I can click that and click play and it
10:35 - will generate an answer similar to in
10:38 - the chat TPT experience
10:41 - is right now the most famous but you
10:44 - also have other resources like bards
10:46 - produced by Google that are very popular
10:49 - I would say like anything else different
10:51 - tooling has different strengths and
10:53 - weaknesses uh chat gbt in my experience
10:57 - is a little bit more um quote unquote
10:59 - creative in one can come up with whereas
11:02 - Bard I think is stronger as a research
11:06 - tool in that it has built-in citations
11:08 - so it's August if you're in the southern
11:12 - state you've already started school if
11:15 - you're uh in New York where I live
11:18 - Schools starting up in a couple of weeks
11:20 - and then you're an educator may be
11:23 - thinking about how to use these
11:24 - Technologies in the classroom
11:27 - um that's a situation where I may
11:28 - recommend something like Bard and it's
11:30 - better citation unless you're doing
11:31 - something like a creative writing
11:33 - exercise which is what we'll be doing
11:36 - now actually
11:39 - so I'm going to take chat gbt and share
11:44 - that here and I want to create this
11:50 - children's story now
11:52 - on a personal note I am a uh proud Uncle
11:56 - of two uh five-year-old nephews they are
12:01 - entering first grades this year and
12:06 - like many five-year-old boys they love
12:09 - dinosaurs and they love jeeps and I I
12:12 - want to as a start of the school year
12:14 - gift make them a story
12:17 - so
12:19 - something I think is really cool about
12:21 - Chachi BT is if you're not sure where to
12:25 - get started with your prompts
12:27 - you can just ask it ask for a prompt so
12:31 - I'm going to open this up and I'm going
12:34 - to ask it for five prompts for a
12:36 - children's story about twin brothers who
12:39 - go on an adventure on the Dinosaur
12:40 - Island to be clear in terms of Dinosaur
12:43 - Island I'm thinking more
12:45 - um Savage lands from X-Men versus
12:49 - um you know the island in Jurassic Park
12:51 - I would not send a child to the island
12:52 - in Jurassic Park that would just be
12:54 - irresponsible but
12:56 - of those five prompts I asked for I
12:59 - asked for two prompts that would be
13:00 - funny
13:01 - two that would be scary and one that
13:05 - would be random this is a way of me
13:08 - engineering my prompt to see different
13:10 - options this is me leveraging what this
13:14 - generative AI can do versus me acting as
13:17 - myself in a brainstorming capacity
13:21 - so ask that to run and we can see some
13:25 - of these options come up
13:31 - and we have a dino race day Dino picnic
13:35 - party lost in a dark Roar of Doom love
13:38 - upon fantastic
13:40 - and Dino Dance Fusion uh We've also
13:44 - named the twins Max and Leo
13:49 - that's fun
13:51 - and
13:54 - I'm looking through and I think the
13:57 - picnic party
13:58 - sounds good so I'm going to start I'm
14:03 - going to copy this
14:05 - and paste it and we're going to continue
14:06 - but I'm also going to refine refine this
14:11 - prompt a little bit more
14:12 - so I'm going to type
14:15 - create a 1000 to 1500 word story
14:21 - about
14:24 - off of the following prompt
14:29 - and I'll click play
14:32 - Emma watched that story show up now
14:37 - this is where this um human AI
14:40 - relationship comes in I am not going to
14:43 - take this story and immediately read it
14:45 - to my nephews there may be things that
14:49 - are not age-appropriate there may be
14:51 - things that are nonsensical there may be
14:53 - things just that I know within my own
14:55 - personal taste I wouldn't want in the
14:58 - story so that's where I am going to go
15:00 - in and refine that process
15:05 - but
15:07 - just in the length of me giving that
15:08 - explanation this entire story was
15:12 - generated
15:14 - and I can copy it to this clipboard and
15:16 - paste it separately where I can continue
15:18 - to work on it
15:21 - so going back to the course
15:26 - we're going to talk a bit more now about
15:28 - image based generative AI so what I just
15:32 - showed you was chat and some of those
15:34 - different techniques for the prompting
15:37 - process within chat
15:39 - and
15:42 - now we're going to do image image very
15:43 - similar of whereas instead of being
15:46 - trained on text these sharing of AIS
15:49 - have been trained on images so different
15:52 - art styles schools
15:56 - um
15:57 - kind of considerations like that
16:00 - that allows to make some really cool
16:01 - stuff and it is technically text to
16:04 - image we are including text and getting
16:06 - an image back so generate a futuristic
16:09 - version of the Mona Lisa
16:11 - and we might get something like this
16:15 - now for the purposes of this live stream
16:17 - I'm going to be using uh Dolly too
16:21 - but I encourage you to look into other
16:24 - resources like mid-journey stable
16:26 - diffusion like I said with Google bard
16:29 - and chat gbt different tools have
16:33 - different strengths and weaknesses and I
16:35 - encourage you to explore that there are
16:37 - also more professional resources that
16:40 - you can pay for to use because this is
16:44 - based off of a free course I'll just be
16:46 - going through free or fairly inexpensive
16:50 - Resources with you today
16:53 - so I have uh Dolly up here and
17:00 - I'm uh as Corey mentioned at the
17:02 - beginning of the
17:04 - presentation of the live stream my
17:07 - background is as a history teacher and I
17:10 - am a dork for a good map love a map and
17:14 - I think that's something that would
17:16 - really enhance this story
17:18 - so I'm going to ask uh create a another
17:22 - create a map of a Dinosaur Island
17:28 - in the style of a 1600s
17:33 - nautical
17:35 - map
17:37 - when I say A nautical map I'm thinking
17:39 - of those
17:40 - you know kind of old school Maps where
17:43 - you have the dragon in the corner and
17:44 - you know there's sea monsters all over
17:48 - the place
17:49 - um and this is what we've gone in here
17:52 - are a few of these different options
17:55 - that we can click
17:58 - and go through
18:01 - and I have to say I kind of love this
18:04 - one I love the abstract shapes I like
18:07 - how there's this idea of signage but I'm
18:11 - also curious if we can drill down on
18:13 - just this format a little bit more
18:16 - so I'm going to click on variations
18:19 - and this is a way of continuing to
18:23 - prompt and guide this machine to give us
18:26 - an output that we want
18:29 - um
18:29 - ultimately generative AI is still a
18:32 - computer and computers want nothing more
18:36 - than to make us happy but we need to ask
18:39 - them for what we want correctly and this
18:42 - is an example of that the more specific
18:44 - and targeted are prompts the better the
18:47 - output is going to get
18:50 - and we have some more of these Maps more
18:54 - of this weathered style I actually like
18:56 - this one I like that there's kind of
18:59 - this foggy area around that that makes
19:01 - it feel much more serious
19:05 - and you'll notice here that I have the
19:07 - option to save this share it download it
19:11 - and it's from here I may move it into
19:15 - something like a Photoshop where I can
19:18 - continue to edit it and work on it and I
19:20 - think this will be a great cover or
19:23 - companion piece to our story
19:27 - so before I go to the next one I'm
19:30 - curious uh Fede or Corey are there any
19:33 - questions in the chat
19:40 - I'm taking a look uh seems like we are
19:43 - answering them as they come so we're
19:46 - good
19:47 - all right fantastic I'll just keep keep
19:50 - on keeping on them
19:55 - all right
19:58 - all right this is actually a really good
19:59 - thing to know so you'll notice that this
20:02 - hasn't loaded for me yet I can just go
20:05 - over here and say restore default
20:08 - workspace and that will allow me to see
20:11 - this applet again
20:13 - so the next thing we're going to be
20:14 - talking about is audio based generative
20:17 - AI this is something I think
20:20 - is both really cool and probably one of
20:23 - the most
20:24 - interestingly challenging gerund of AIT
20:28 - utilize compared to image and text
20:32 - so this is something that can be used in
20:34 - things like Music Creation audio
20:36 - creation
20:38 - um
20:39 - while we're getting into
20:41 - some of those ethical considerations
20:44 - think about how different artists have
20:47 - very distinct musical styles so if
20:50 - you're creating generative music are you
20:52 - allowed to say
20:54 - I want this to sound like a Bob Dylan
20:57 - song where that's an artist who has a
21:00 - very specific sound and feel to his
21:04 - music there was a really interesting
21:07 - case uh fairly recently of someone
21:09 - posting a song on Spotify that sounded
21:13 - like a Drake and the weekend song and it
21:16 - was entirely made through generative
21:17 - music
21:19 - where
21:20 - it's less ethically messy is if you're
21:25 - um a video editor if you are trying to
21:29 - maybe get started with mixing music and
21:31 - playing around with that yourself it's a
21:33 - great way of quickly creating a
21:37 - background track to take and then use as
21:39 - a base to work on
21:42 - so similar as this create a calming song
21:45 - and we have this recording here
21:48 - I was fortunate enough to
21:52 - get a
21:54 - um trial into music LM
21:58 - which is Google's
22:00 - attempt at getting started with gerund
22:04 - of music it's free and it's very fun to
22:07 - play around with so
22:11 - the reason why I said this was
22:13 - interestingly challenging is
22:15 - you know our our eyes are our primary
22:18 - sets right so we're very good at
22:21 - describing things we see and we're very
22:23 - good at communicating so for asking for
22:27 - a text or asking for an image we
22:29 - intuitively know how to be very exact in
22:32 - what we ask for
22:34 - I do not have a particularly strong
22:36 - background in music theory so I can't
22:40 - ask this program to be specific you know
22:43 - to ask for it to be in a certain chord
22:46 - or something like that
22:47 - I don't know how to do that but what I
22:50 - find really cool about this tool is that
22:51 - it can
22:53 - work within a certain mood so
22:56 - I had that up there before but I'm going
22:58 - to say a happy song
23:01 - um
23:02 - with an adventurous
23:06 - tune
23:07 - good for exploring a jungle
23:15 - and I'm going to see how it does with
23:18 - that
23:28 - it's going to give it a moment of
23:29 - looking
23:31 - [Music]
23:34 - and I actually like this quite a bit
23:38 - um
23:38 - I apologize I'm not sure if you're
23:42 - able to hear the audio on your end but
23:46 - it came in a really interesting way what
23:49 - I do find with the music LM is
23:51 - it can sound a little tinny which is
23:54 - really interesting to me I'm not sure
23:56 - why that is but again this is where you
23:59 - can take this download this track and go
24:02 - forward I'll also add that there's a
24:04 - really cool
24:05 - um rating system that they have this is
24:07 - how they're training their AI so for
24:10 - every prompt you actually get two song
24:13 - objects
24:14 - and I actually like this one more so I'm
24:17 - going to give it a trophy got a little
24:20 - confetti
24:21 - oh all right um I'm glad to hear that
24:24 - you were able to hear it and from here
24:27 - you can click it and download it or send
24:30 - feedback and continue to work on it
24:37 - all right so let's go back over to the
24:41 - course
24:43 - oh
24:44 - so right now
24:46 - um I now have
24:48 - my text I have my cover and I have
24:52 - background music to play now there's
24:55 - other things I could do I could get a
24:58 - voice to text to read it out although
25:02 - most voice text tools are not guarant of
25:04 - AI they may use AI button
25:07 - um sharing of AI is a fairly specific
25:10 - thing
25:11 - and
25:14 - I may want to create a video which would
25:16 - be the next slide now I am not
25:19 - um going to take you through that
25:21 - process
25:22 - just because
25:25 - video editing is obviously a more
25:28 - extensive process we would be here for
25:31 - the next hour as I click through and
25:34 - check audio levels that's not going to
25:36 - be fun for anyone
25:38 - but I will talk a little bit Ah I think
25:42 - it's having a little trouble because I'm
25:43 - zoomed in that's okay
25:46 - so this is really interesting though and
25:49 - there's been a lot of
25:52 - very interesting controversy around uh
25:55 - the applications of AI and video
25:59 - you know there was
26:01 - um Prince's likeness being used during
26:04 - the Super Bowl in Minnesota a couple of
26:05 - years ago a lot of this
26:09 - um current strike in Hollywood is around
26:13 - actors being paid a lump sum to have
26:16 - their AI likeness used in perpetuity by
26:19 - Studios and what does that mean and
26:22 - that's
26:24 - a really interesting place of what we're
26:27 - talking about in a bit which is this
26:29 - intersection of new technology and
26:32 - ethics of what does a technology
26:36 - like this represent for people's labor
26:38 - for their
26:41 - control over their likeness
26:44 - um these are things that will have to
26:47 - consider over the coming years and we'll
26:50 - have to figure out a lot very quickly
26:53 - on the plus side
26:55 - generative AI videos boost productivity
26:58 - it allows you to create things faster
27:01 - and will likely lead to
27:05 - furthering this you know really
27:07 - incredible artistic explosion we've seen
27:09 - since YouTube was invented of
27:12 - this democratization of Art and in
27:16 - overall increase in quality so I'm I'm
27:18 - really excited to see what generated
27:21 - video can do as long as we're using it
27:23 - in a way that isn't
27:25 - uh alienated for people
27:28 - and that is something if you're someone
27:30 - who is considering using generative
27:33 - video themselves
27:35 - um to consider
27:37 - all right
27:41 - risks and limitations of Darren of AI I
27:43 - really like this
27:45 - and this is something I'll say is really
27:48 - important to us at code academy is
27:52 - as I've said a couple times this
27:54 - technology is really exciting and
27:57 - there's so much
27:59 - it can do in so much it will do uh
28:03 - as a transformative thing
28:05 - but we need to also understand it for
28:09 - what it is so that we don't overly rely
28:11 - on it or use it irresponsibly
28:15 - so the first thing I'll say is at least
28:18 - for now these AIS
28:22 - view any information that's input into
28:25 - them equally so it won't necessarily
28:27 - know what information is private versus
28:31 - what information is public that you
28:33 - would put in
28:34 - so you'll know this when I was creating
28:37 - this story
28:38 - I didn't add the names of my nephews I
28:41 - also didn't add a picture of them when I
28:44 - was playing around with an Island map
28:46 - for Dolly that's because there's a
28:49 - chance that once I click in that
28:50 - information that now lives within the
28:54 - generative Ai and may be used in future
28:56 - models there's a lot of controversy
28:59 - right now
29:00 - um I was reading even this morning that
29:02 - the New York Times may be suing open AI
29:05 - because of how much chat CBT was trained
29:09 - on the New York Times articles I've also
29:12 - seen comic artists who have very
29:15 - specific Styles or viewpoints have their
29:19 - work used through generative AI by
29:23 - different groups maybe groups who don't
29:25 - represent their political Outlook or
29:28 - social Outlook but it still looks like
29:30 - their work
29:32 - so there's a lot of interesting
29:34 - conversations right now going on of
29:38 - again like how do we use this correctly
29:40 - and responsibly I'll also add this in
29:43 - terms of data so
29:47 - tactivities are really a good tool for
29:50 - coding we actually have a case study up
29:53 - right now on how to debug your code
29:56 - using chat gbt or how to simulate paired
30:00 - programming with chat gbt that's
30:02 - something we'll be having out on the
30:04 - website within the next couple of weeks
30:06 - but keep in mind any codes you put on to
30:10 - chat TPT now lives there and is now
30:13 - within that system so if there is code
30:17 - that is unique to yourself or unique to
30:20 - the organization that you work for you
30:23 - really should not be testing it within
30:25 - uh chat gbt
30:32 - another limitation to talk about is
30:35 - hallucination
30:37 - so
30:39 - Hallucination is something really
30:41 - interesting to me because it's something
30:43 - that
30:45 - feels very alien but is actually
30:46 - something humans do as well in that what
30:51 - this machine does what DDT does and
30:54 - other alternative AI is that it looks
30:55 - for patterns and then takes those
30:57 - patterns and says okay based off these
30:59 - patterns I am going to come to these
31:01 - conclusions and it doesn't know if it's
31:04 - true or false it just knows that within
31:07 - the pattern it would make sense for that
31:09 - to be true so it's the same way of
31:12 - you know maybe looking at
31:16 - something and saying okay
31:19 - um
31:20 - so I Ferris wheels
31:24 - um thinking okay that is was probably
31:28 - invented by a guy named Ferris which by
31:30 - the way it was but if it wasn't that
31:33 - would be a hallucination of because it's
31:36 - a word and then a thing after it I am
31:39 - going to assume okay actually the better
31:42 - example uh if I'm using duct tape there
31:45 - is no uh Mr or miss duck in the world
31:48 - it's just called duct tape
31:51 - so that would be a human hallucination a
31:56 - pattern misunderstanding and
31:58 - the problem with cat gbt is that it will
32:01 - deliver this information factually
32:04 - so this is why while something like this
32:07 - is a very useful research tool in a
32:10 - limited capacity
32:13 - um you shouldn't use it to make more
32:16 - complex decisions so to give an example
32:20 - I recently wanted to take my wife out
32:24 - for a date in Queens where I live so I
32:27 - asked for 10 data ideas in Queens for
32:31 - under thirty dollars
32:33 - and
32:34 - I promise I'm generally not cheap I was
32:36 - just curious to see what would come from
32:39 - it
32:40 - and what came out was a lot of different
32:43 - answers but not everything was in Queens
32:45 - some was in Brooklyn someone was in
32:47 - Manhattan because what it probably did
32:49 - was look at hundreds if not thousands of
32:53 - websites that have
32:55 - fun date idea or fun cheap date idea
32:58 - lists in New York City
33:00 - and didn't narrow it down correctly
33:04 - so the process of verification is very
33:08 - important when using generative AI for
33:10 - doing any kind of research if you're
33:12 - doing something like what I just did
33:14 - which is a more creative exercise that's
33:17 - fine don't have to worry about that as
33:18 - much
33:20 - um but definitely if you're doing
33:21 - something for work
33:28 - all right
33:29 - and last is these ethical questions
33:33 - which I've been talking about throughout
33:36 - so things like
33:38 - where does work begin and end and how
33:41 - this credit for that work
33:42 - work
33:44 - we are actually talking about this a lot
33:46 - internally at codecademy so at
33:49 - I help manage something called
33:51 - codecademy docs which is an open
33:53 - contribution tool and we've had
33:56 - discussions internally of
33:58 - if someone submits something that was
34:01 - created by a generated AI did they write
34:04 - it
34:05 - and
34:06 - we've had conversations and we still are
34:10 - not 100
34:11 - happy with the answer that we have which
34:14 - is if someone used generative AI as a
34:17 - base and then augmented it and made it
34:20 - their own to a point that it's their own
34:22 - work that's fine but that
34:26 - vagueness of at what point does it go
34:29 - from being more artificially
34:31 - intelligently created versus human
34:33 - created
34:34 - is a very interesting
34:37 - and sticky question that will probably
34:41 - be working through for a while again
34:43 - going back to the writer strike just
34:45 - because that's such a big thing in our
34:47 - cultural conversation right now
34:49 - if someone gets an idea for a TV episode
34:52 - from gerund of AI and then writes it do
34:55 - they get credit for that idea
34:58 - um think about highly serialized shows
35:00 - like a law and order or Chicago Fire or
35:04 - an
35:05 - um Gray's Anatomy
35:07 - generative AI could probably write at
35:09 - least the beginning of a script for
35:10 - those shows because they've been going
35:12 - for so long there's a certain flow and
35:15 - feel to those scripts so what does it
35:18 - mean for things like that in the future
35:20 - there's also issues of
35:24 - data and how it's interpreted
35:27 - so chat TBT again doesn't make
35:30 - assumptions it merely takes things in
35:33 - and outputs what it sees in terms of the
35:37 - patterns so if it's looking at things
35:41 - like government data things like that
35:43 - and ask for reports it will not be able
35:44 - to look at it through a human lens only
35:48 - um through exactly what it seats so
35:50 - there's
35:51 - a lot of stuff where we don't
35:55 - again go through the trouble of
35:57 - verifying checking coming to our own
35:59 - conclusions it can lead to
36:02 - um
36:04 - incomplete views of the world
36:09 - thank you for someone who said duct that
36:11 - was I I actually uh questioned myself
36:15 - and I was like is it duck or ducked it
36:18 - is ducked but again there's no Mr dot as
36:21 - far as I'm aware or misstocked
36:24 - all right so that is the overview of the
36:28 - course but again we have a lot of other
36:30 - really great AI content both for
36:33 - introductory levels like our case
36:35 - studies our um docs entries we have
36:38 - tutorial articles we have our intro to
36:41 - chat TPT course we have a lot of great
36:43 - content we also have more advanced AI
36:47 - content
36:49 - um that you can check out on our site we
36:51 - have an AI Hub it's awesome I would
36:54 - highly encourage you to check it out
36:58 - so that's everything for
37:02 - my presentation so if um
37:05 - buddy if you want to do any questions we
37:08 - can use that time for you know next 10
37:09 - minutes
37:14 - absolutely thank you so much for the
37:16 - presentation that was awesome very
37:18 - instructive I think everybody enjoyed it
37:21 - in the chat
37:22 - uh yeah so I'm going to just ask the
37:25 - chat to collect their thoughts and think
37:28 - about questions that they want to ask
37:29 - you I'll be reading them through as they
37:33 - come in and then Adam you can give us
37:35 - your thoughts and your takes on the
37:37 - questions from the audience so please do
37:40 - share them in the chat I will ask you a
37:42 - question of my own while we wait for
37:44 - people to submit their own questions and
37:46 - I was wondering
37:48 - looking at generative Ai and how the
37:52 - term AI in general is thrown around uh
37:56 - you touched on this during the
37:57 - representation that generative AI is
38:00 - different it's very specific type of AI
38:02 - so
38:04 - do you see that uh misconceptions of
38:08 - what AI does between the different types
38:11 - or like different flavors of AI is that
38:13 - something that you see people confusing
38:15 - and maybe leading up to uh maybe using
38:18 - AI wrong like it's an amazing tool but
38:20 - you still need to know what is it that
38:22 - is going to give you what to expect
38:26 - that's a really interesting question
38:28 - father
38:29 - um
38:31 - I would say it's
38:33 - there's two aspects to it right which is
38:36 - people are using
38:39 - generative AI
38:41 - machine learning in AI interchangeably a
38:45 - lot of the time and they're not
38:48 - interchangeable so we had AI in our
38:52 - lives for a really long time
38:55 - um maybe just not in ways we see or ways
38:58 - we think about so for example on a lot
39:00 - of our smartphones we have
39:03 - a Siri or you know a Google Assistant
39:07 - Siri actually just turned on for me so
39:09 - that that's on me
39:12 - um helping out and it will creep me out
39:15 - when my phone will say
39:17 - hey it's
39:19 - um 6 a.m like you usually take you know
39:23 - you eat at this time so like do you want
39:24 - to eat breakfast and that's so creepy
39:28 - but it's just pattern recognition and
39:30 - that's the kind of thing that AI is good
39:32 - for is that I'll put them into my
39:33 - calendar a lot like eat breakfast or
39:36 - I'll
39:37 - you know
39:38 - um a better example would be on
39:41 - Thursdays at six o'clock I call my
39:43 - parents and I might get a reminder for
39:45 - my phone to call my parents that's AI or
39:48 - the ranking we see on social media of
39:51 - knowing how to kind of curate our feed a
39:53 - certain way is an AI being used that's
39:56 - not a generative AI it's not as smart as
39:59 - what we see but it is an implementation
40:01 - of that
40:04 - um
40:05 - machine learning I don't have the
40:07 - strongest background in admittedly
40:11 - um but I'll say again it's a use of
40:14 - large
40:16 - uh amounts of data to come to different
40:18 - conclusions it's not necessarily
40:20 - generative there's perhaps more of a
40:22 - human component in there
40:24 - in terms of how people think about it
40:29 - we're already
40:32 - seeing companies
40:34 - um lay off certain employees because
40:35 - they think they'll be able to replace
40:36 - some with gerund of AI I think they're
40:39 - going to be
40:42 - sorely surprised
40:44 - um how much they miss people because I
40:48 - think it this will not
40:53 - destroy jobs so much as displaced them
40:56 - so it's not that a job will
40:58 - fundamentally disappear it's that
41:01 - perhaps a starting job as a copywriter
41:04 - you'll be doing a lot more copy editing
41:06 - of content that I generated AI created
41:09 - which is ultimately in my opinion
41:11 - probably a little bit more interesting
41:12 - work you're thinking a little bit more
41:13 - strategically about content
41:16 - um
41:17 - but I think people are in a little bit
41:19 - of a rush to say this is going to like
41:22 - utterly change the world I I don't think
41:25 - we're there quite yet
41:27 - okay fair enough thank you for your
41:29 - answer I see a question in the chat from
41:32 - Matthew uh has someone who is learning
41:34 - to program at the present moment
41:36 - would you recommend using the AI to
41:38 - assist with code now on an early stage
41:41 - of learning or learn to write code
41:43 - without a without Ai and use it later
41:48 - that's such an interesting question
41:51 - um I've wondered about this a lot myself
41:53 - of everyone remembers being in math
41:57 - class and being told hey well everyone
42:00 - over 25 26 remembers being in math class
42:03 - and being told you're not going to have
42:05 - a calculator everywhere you go so you
42:08 - need to learn how to do math this way
42:09 - and surprise we have calculators on us
42:14 - everywhere we go
42:15 - and
42:17 - I do wonder is that going to be the case
42:20 - with coding of
42:23 - there's so much that's going to be
42:25 - taking care of you through the
42:26 - generative AI that
42:29 - um the amount you'll have to learn or
42:30 - how you'll learn will be different
42:33 - well I will say though if we stay within
42:35 - this math example is even if you are
42:39 - using a calculator you still need number
42:41 - sense you still need to know the rules
42:43 - of math and how different equations
42:46 - relate to each other for how to
42:48 - implement them so I would say if you are
42:52 - just getting started out learning to
42:54 - code it's still important to learn how
42:56 - that code Works what's unique about that
42:59 - language what it does
43:02 - um and the Mechanics for it before going
43:04 - to generative AI because if you go to
43:07 - Giant of AI immediately you'll be more
43:11 - using something without fully
43:13 - understanding it and especially if you
43:16 - plan to work as a programmer that puts
43:18 - you in a very vulnerable position
43:20 - it sounds to me a little bit like the
43:23 - analogy of the bicycle and walking where
43:26 - the bicycle will make you move faster
43:28 - but you still need to know where you're
43:30 - going
43:32 - I love that
43:34 - um I was also thinking
43:36 - it's like the difference between knowing
43:38 - how to drive from a car and being a
43:41 - mechanic uh
43:45 - um
43:47 - I know it has four wheels but I couldn't
43:50 - I think it's very self-explanatory for
43:53 - anyone that thinks that AI can do it all
43:55 - if you just don't have like you said any
43:57 - knowledge any sense of the code I
43:59 - becomes very obvious very quickly that
44:01 - you you're not going to get very far
44:04 - tools uh let's see looking at the chat
44:10 - somebody said generative AI doesn't
44:12 - always give facts but rather recognizes
44:15 - patterns this can become very convincing
44:18 - how can we ensure that we don't fully
44:21 - believe it I guess the question is about
44:24 - how to vet the answers you're getting
44:26 - from AI how do you know
44:28 - because it can be very convincing
44:30 - sometimes it's just you know the AI
44:31 - sounds like it knows what it's talking
44:33 - about
44:34 - yeah um
44:36 - this may come as a surprise to people
44:39 - but sometimes there's misinformation on
44:42 - the internet just in general
44:45 - um
44:46 - and again this is the
44:49 - former history teacher in me of it's
44:52 - always good to verify information
44:55 - and we know there are certain sources
44:59 - that are more trustworthy there are the
45:02 - Wikipedia is actually shockingly
45:04 - trustworthy in a lot of ways
45:06 - um
45:07 - respected news organizations
45:10 - uh scientific journals that we can check
45:12 - in on information
45:15 - I would say again it depends
45:18 - what kind of information you're looking
45:20 - for if you're a look if you are planning
45:24 - um a vacation and you're just looking at
45:25 - things to do in Dallas
45:27 - that's probably fine you don't have to
45:30 - worry about it too much maybe if you
45:31 - plan to book something you'll end up
45:34 - verifying it that way
45:35 - however if you are
45:38 - looking up something
45:41 - um
45:42 - more scientific then yes you shouldn't
45:46 - or certain treatments for something
45:48 - first of all call a doctor don't use
45:50 - generative AI to treat a cult
45:54 - um
45:55 - but also make sure to verify I'll also
45:58 - say I feel like some people are worried
46:01 - about that when they talk about Job
46:02 - displacement what if there is a cheaper
46:04 - medical tier which is AI enabled and for
46:07 - and to talk to a real human you have to
46:09 - get through an AI first right
46:12 - so
46:14 - that that is really interesting
46:17 - um
46:17 - give me a moment
46:21 - so
46:25 - a uh
46:26 - podcast I listen to It's called
46:28 - philosophize this did
46:31 - a um the host is a man named Stephen
46:34 - West he did a whole episode on gerund of
46:37 - AI and its meaning and he actually
46:38 - talked about medicine specifically and
46:42 - how there could be really exciting
46:44 - applications in that
46:46 - there are just so many doctors in the
46:49 - world
46:51 - and
46:53 - you do see kind of a natural
46:58 - um choke point in that you have a lot of
47:00 - people that need care and only a certain
47:02 - amount of doctors who can provide that
47:04 - care and
47:06 - we don't have it now but maybe in five
47:09 - years ten years there will be a
47:11 - generative AI that is sufficiently
47:12 - trained to accurately provide
47:17 - um medical advice to people at least for
47:19 - low-level things so that doctors can
47:22 - focus on bigger concerns I'm thinking
47:25 - specifically of
47:27 - um
47:28 - a family member who recently had a child
47:31 - and has been calling my poor cousin
47:36 - who's a pediatrician every two days
47:38 - saying is this normal is this normal is
47:40 - this normal
47:41 - having a generative AI tool that's
47:44 - trained to reliably help provide medical
47:47 - information would
47:49 - really be a game changer for situations
47:52 - like that but again we are not there yet
47:56 - another jail right I think we are
48:00 - this might be related to what we're just
48:02 - talking about a little bit uh there was
48:03 - a user in the chat asking about the
48:05 - degradation of AI by saying if AI
48:09 - generated content enters the data sets
48:12 - the future AIS will be trained on do you
48:15 - have some sort of vicious spiral where
48:17 - the data just keeps getting worse and
48:19 - worse because it's you know it's sort of
48:22 - feeding itself have you have you read
48:23 - into this do you do you think that this
48:26 - could become a problem
48:28 - no but that's scary
48:30 - um
48:32 - again it's one of those things of we
48:35 - just need to be mindful of the pitfalls
48:39 - with any new technology and build robust
48:42 - systems to incorporate it and use it
48:46 - responsibly like maybe this means
48:49 - um and I've had conversations with
48:50 - people on our data science team
48:53 - um about this that we need to be really
48:55 - disciplined about having clean clear
48:58 - data before inputting anything into a
49:00 - generative AI which is again something
49:03 - we should be doing anyway and is a big
49:06 - problem in the field of data is bad data
49:09 - so we're kind of there already
49:12 - so it's it's more of a matter of again
49:15 - like making sure
49:17 - we adapt in a responsible way and I
49:20 - think in terms of it being a spiral I
49:23 - don't know about that I could definitely
49:25 - see it getting worse before it gets
49:27 - better
49:28 - because humans are reactive we like to
49:30 - create a problem for ourselves before we
49:32 - solve it
49:33 - but I don't think it will cause you know
49:35 - some kind of data apocalypse
49:39 - uh going on about the pattern
49:43 - recognition that you talked to during
49:44 - the presentation someone is asking in
49:46 - the chat
49:47 - if generative AI could be used to
49:51 - leverage business Analytics
49:53 - so I guess the field of statistics and
49:55 - math is something that ji jnai can work
49:58 - on
50:00 - um yeah so this is where I was talking
50:02 - about different types of tooling so chat
50:06 - EBT can do very basic things so in my
50:10 - own work I think a lot about search
50:12 - engine optimization so how well things
50:15 - rank on Google
50:16 - and you can go on chat gbt and say what
50:20 - are best practices for SEO and it will
50:24 - give you something pretty good I can't
50:26 - go into chat TBT and say give me a full
50:28 - SEO strategy based off like these
50:31 - metrics in the company because one I'd
50:34 - be giving chat to BT a lot of
50:36 - information about code academy that I
50:38 - shouldn't be and to
50:41 - it doesn't know enough about the
50:43 - specifics of our context to give
50:46 - good information
50:48 - in terms of business analytics that's a
50:50 - long way of me saying yes I imagine
50:52 - there is Jared toong that could do that
50:54 - very well it would likely be a paid tool
50:57 - and
51:00 - we're in a bit of a wild west era where
51:02 - maybe in a year or two years there will
51:04 - be a tool with that sophisticated
51:08 - um to be able to do that if there is I
51:10 - don't know of it yet
51:12 - nice I think it reminds me do you feel
51:15 - like this is a bit like the revolution
51:17 - with computers back in the 80s or the
51:20 - 90s where computers were getting fast
51:21 - enough that they they were actually
51:23 - useful to solve scientific questions and
51:25 - problems and simulations and at the time
51:29 - uh there was this problem where you not
51:32 - you didn't always know why the computer
51:34 - was giving you the answer it was so it
51:37 - became very important for scientists at
51:39 - the time to know how to how to ask the
51:42 - right question so you would know that is
51:44 - answering your question and it's not
51:46 - just spitting out numbers that you're
51:47 - not really sure what you know if they're
51:49 - actually about what you asked the
51:50 - computer so do you see some similarities
51:53 - with that nowadays with AI where the
51:55 - ability to craft a good prompt and to
51:58 - know the limits of AI and how far that
52:01 - prompt is gonna go how it's going to be
52:03 - interpreted uh it's almost as important
52:06 - as knowing how to use the tool itself uh
52:08 - like your example with uh looking for
52:10 - restaurants in Brooklyn
52:13 - but I can only say yes that was a great
52:16 - I agree
52:18 - yeah um I think that makes complete
52:20 - sense and it's also that these
52:22 - Technologies happen in stages
52:24 - um where they typically start off
52:28 - invented existing being used in very
52:31 - specific Circles of specialists and then
52:36 - you get to where we are where certain
52:39 - applications are found potential is
52:42 - understood
52:43 - and the next phase is
52:46 - building out that infrastructure and
52:49 - systems of use that will allow it to
52:52 - fully be employed in the general
52:54 - population and be as transformative as
52:57 - it has the potential to be
52:58 - so to go way back
53:01 - you know people knew the steam engine
53:03 - was a big deal when it was invented
53:05 - there was another 50 years before we had
53:06 - railroads
53:08 - so we are in the steam engine moment
53:12 - um I'm very interested to see what the
53:14 - railroads will look like
53:15 - fair enough someone was asking about
53:18 - completing code academy courses and then
53:20 - what
53:21 - so
53:24 - um thinking about the AI content that
53:27 - we've released recently we have several
53:29 - courses on it uh how do you see somebody
53:33 - is this sort of do you see these AI
53:36 - courses uh something that goes alongside
53:38 - of machine learning and data science
53:40 - courses do you think that is something
53:42 - complementary or something that should
53:43 - come before or after how do you see the
53:46 - the catalog for somebody that is data
53:48 - curious I guess
53:50 - I think that's a that's really
53:52 - interesting I I would say it depends
53:55 - what you want your outcome to be
53:57 - so if you are just
54:00 - looking to understand what generative AI
54:04 - is
54:06 - um I full you can take these courses do
54:08 - these case studies to see how you might
54:10 - implement it in your work and in your
54:12 - life and that may be enough
54:15 - um how we're thinking of it and how we
54:17 - hope to evolve our curriculum over the
54:20 - rest of the year is to really find a way
54:23 - to work it into your workflows and
54:25 - practices be it as a programmer or a
54:28 - data scientist or a cyber security
54:30 - specialist
54:32 - so we'll
54:34 - um we just put out a new data science
54:36 - course Alicia if you could actually put
54:38 - that in um the chat that covers aspects
54:42 - of data science and AI
54:45 - um I'd also say things like machine
54:48 - learning would be a direction to go in
54:50 - if you're interested in the nitty-gritty
54:51 - of how it works
54:53 - I would say
54:55 - regardless and you know if you're not
54:57 - doing this already I would encourage you
54:59 - to do so in the chat think about
55:02 - those moments at work and recognizing
55:05 - them as
55:06 - okay this is a place where I could use
55:09 - gerund of AI to make my life a little
55:11 - bit easier and then you can start
55:13 - working to establish yourself on your
55:15 - team in your company as a leader who
55:18 - understands how to use this and put
55:20 - yourself in a real position to be
55:21 - successful in that way
55:24 - okay well I think that I was very solid
55:27 - advice for anyone trying to get into the
55:28 - data field so we have run out of time
55:32 - for Q a and I want to thank everybody
55:34 - for attending today's live stream if
55:36 - you've attended or part one or part two
55:38 - of our series thank you again for coming
55:39 - back for part three if you haven't
55:42 - please check out our YouTube channel
55:43 - where you can find the other two parts
55:45 - of our three-part series on the
55:47 - evolution of code academy we are
55:49 - celebrating our 12 years in online so
55:52 - thank you everybody for for joining us
55:54 - in this journey I hope that it was a fun
55:56 - experience I hope that everybody took

Cleaned transcript:

foreign hello hey everyone welcome back to this final live stream in our threepart journey through code Academy's Evolution today we're looking at one of our brand new courses intro to generative AI I'm Corey c code Academy's content marketing manager and I'm joined by Betty Garcia Lorca our community manager who you probably recognize from these live streams and forums and Discord as well as Adam Herman curriculum manager at code academy who will be walking us through this lesson and then over in the chat we have Alicia grama a senior curriculum developer who is on hand to answer all of your questions live so in case you haven't heard it's code Academy's birthday tomorrow we're turning 12 almost a teenager um the tech world has has changed a lot since we started out in 2011 and one of the biggest Transformations happened just last year when the research company opened AI launched the generative AI chatbot chat GPT and I'm curious how many of you here use Chachi BT to code or for work or just for fun let us know in the chat we recently launched a bunch of brand new AI courses and case studies that'll teach you how to use and build AI systems like these in a thoughtful responsible and inventive way uh but today Adam's going to show us how to make an original children's book with generative AI using our free beginner friendly course intro to generative AI as a guide this is a fun use for AI but it's also a very practical one if you say need some more bedtime stories in your rotation or you're a teacher of young children or you just need a clever gift idea for a kid in your life but keep in mind that you can go and take this course whenever you want on your own time and it's linked in the description below before we get into it let me tell you a little bit about Adam he started as a classroom teacher before moving in to Tech and now he's the curriculum manager at codecademy where he does strategy work for articles and code academy docs and has recently been working on producing new generative AI content for us hi Adam hey Corey hey I wanted to ask you a question before you jump into it um do you use generative AI Tools in your daily life and if so how that is a great question Corey so I think what's so interesting in general about like this moment with chair and of AI is that we are in kind of like a state of play with it of this is such a different cool interesting technology and we are still constantly finding new ways of integrating it both into our work lives and into our personal lives and something that was uh really drove this home for me was um like a month or two months ago I I am a fairly mediocre Chef um but I I try and I wanted to make a meat sauce and I was very intimidated so I went to Chachi BT and I said you know I'm a beginner level Chef I want to make a meat sauce I want to be this many servings what do I do and it spit out a whole recipe for me and the part where it got really really cool was I can then ask okay well how do I get oil out then or how do I chop the garlic pasta properly so you could keep digging in in a way that you don't get with things like a Search tool or other research tools and it is okay that's what I'm wanting to know surprisingly yes um there is a screenshot that thank you for asking um there's a screenshot of the recipe on my phone I'm very proud of it um so yes the the robot had good taste in food somehow love it thank you and that's the kind of thinking I think we're all working on and something I hope to encourage in all of you from today is not just what can these Technologies do it's how can they interact with each other how can they interact with our lives to change how we work and interact so go I'm going to share my screen with all of you and let's get into this course we'll be going through so the course is intro to generated Ai and as the name implies this is a introductory course going through different types of generative AI tooling and how people are using it we'll also be going into as Corey implied earlier how to use this technology responsibly and some of the interesting ethical conversations happening in this space right now I am not going to go too much into how to program with serendive AI we do have a lot of really great content around that that this is more for people looking to see what this technology is and how people are using it so why are we going to cover we're going to be doing an intro to the course and what it is I'll be going into this generative AI content workflow so I'll be showing you as I create this children's story how these different Technologies can be used together and what responsibilities we have as human users to make sure that the content is accurate and safe and as well as going into those ethical considerations I talked about before and then finally we're going to do a wrap up with some q a between myself and FedEx so over this you should be learning what generative AI is the different types of generative AI in their use cases and as I said before those ethical concerns and considerations so let's hop into the course so the course as I said is intro to generative AI and the author of this course Alicia grama is actually in the chat uh here today so she's here to answer any specific questions you may have about the course content so before anything else just what is generative AI um generative AI is a very Advanced learning uh model that uses that is trained on millions of different texts images uh code samples and what is more than anything is a synthesizer so it can take all of that information look for certain patterns and create an output system so to address the first thing is is it intelligent depends how you define intelligence uh a generative AI could not create something wholly new per se what it does is create an amalgamation of other things that have been input into it if you want to get philosophical about it that's everything that anyone makes is that but obviously it doesn't make it in a selfconscious way which is arguably where that intelligence happens but um whether or not it's AI it is really cool and very inventive and efficient in what it can do and what we're trying to figure out is at what point does the work that the AI can do end and human work begins and how I typically have learned to divide it there's a uh great book called range uh by an author named David Epstein and he talks about the difference between kind systems and wicked systems a kind system is something like uh chess it's something like uh maybe um certain types of legal work where it's happening within a very set system in which there are defined rules uh AI do very very well in kind system problem solving it's why AI um initially when I came onto the scene one of the most high profile things it could do was play chess uh humans are very good at Wicked problems they are good at high level strategy taking disparate pieces information and creating something cohesive out of it so throughout this I'll be showing you how to use AI to get to a point that you can begin as a human iterating on what you're using and making it something wholly better in original and suited to your purposes foreign so the first thing uh we'll be talking about is textbased generative AI this is probably the most famous or splashiest of the technologies that we've seen uh most famously chat gbt but there are also resources like bards that you can use I'll point out that within this course we have a fake GPT that uh we have a really brilliant interactive developer named Wesley on the team who made this for us and it simulates chat TBT right in our learning environment so I can click that and click play and it will generate an answer similar to in the chat TPT experience is right now the most famous but you also have other resources like bards produced by Google that are very popular I would say like anything else different tooling has different strengths and weaknesses uh chat gbt in my experience is a little bit more um quote unquote creative in one can come up with whereas Bard I think is stronger as a research tool in that it has builtin citations so it's August if you're in the southern state you've already started school if you're uh in New York where I live Schools starting up in a couple of weeks and then you're an educator may be thinking about how to use these Technologies in the classroom um that's a situation where I may recommend something like Bard and it's better citation unless you're doing something like a creative writing exercise which is what we'll be doing now actually so I'm going to take chat gbt and share that here and I want to create this children's story now on a personal note I am a uh proud Uncle of two uh fiveyearold nephews they are entering first grades this year and like many fiveyearold boys they love dinosaurs and they love jeeps and I I want to as a start of the school year gift make them a story so something I think is really cool about Chachi BT is if you're not sure where to get started with your prompts you can just ask it ask for a prompt so I'm going to open this up and I'm going to ask it for five prompts for a children's story about twin brothers who go on an adventure on the Dinosaur Island to be clear in terms of Dinosaur Island I'm thinking more um Savage lands from XMen versus um you know the island in Jurassic Park I would not send a child to the island in Jurassic Park that would just be irresponsible but of those five prompts I asked for I asked for two prompts that would be funny two that would be scary and one that would be random this is a way of me engineering my prompt to see different options this is me leveraging what this generative AI can do versus me acting as myself in a brainstorming capacity so ask that to run and we can see some of these options come up and we have a dino race day Dino picnic party lost in a dark Roar of Doom love upon fantastic and Dino Dance Fusion uh We've also named the twins Max and Leo that's fun and I'm looking through and I think the picnic party sounds good so I'm going to start I'm going to copy this and paste it and we're going to continue but I'm also going to refine refine this prompt a little bit more so I'm going to type create a 1000 to 1500 word story about off of the following prompt and I'll click play Emma watched that story show up now this is where this um human AI relationship comes in I am not going to take this story and immediately read it to my nephews there may be things that are not ageappropriate there may be things that are nonsensical there may be things just that I know within my own personal taste I wouldn't want in the story so that's where I am going to go in and refine that process but just in the length of me giving that explanation this entire story was generated and I can copy it to this clipboard and paste it separately where I can continue to work on it so going back to the course we're going to talk a bit more now about image based generative AI so what I just showed you was chat and some of those different techniques for the prompting process within chat and now we're going to do image image very similar of whereas instead of being trained on text these sharing of AIS have been trained on images so different art styles schools um kind of considerations like that that allows to make some really cool stuff and it is technically text to image we are including text and getting an image back so generate a futuristic version of the Mona Lisa and we might get something like this now for the purposes of this live stream I'm going to be using uh Dolly too but I encourage you to look into other resources like midjourney stable diffusion like I said with Google bard and chat gbt different tools have different strengths and weaknesses and I encourage you to explore that there are also more professional resources that you can pay for to use because this is based off of a free course I'll just be going through free or fairly inexpensive Resources with you today so I have uh Dolly up here and I'm uh as Corey mentioned at the beginning of the presentation of the live stream my background is as a history teacher and I am a dork for a good map love a map and I think that's something that would really enhance this story so I'm going to ask uh create a another create a map of a Dinosaur Island in the style of a 1600s nautical map when I say A nautical map I'm thinking of those you know kind of old school Maps where you have the dragon in the corner and you know there's sea monsters all over the place um and this is what we've gone in here are a few of these different options that we can click and go through and I have to say I kind of love this one I love the abstract shapes I like how there's this idea of signage but I'm also curious if we can drill down on just this format a little bit more so I'm going to click on variations and this is a way of continuing to prompt and guide this machine to give us an output that we want um ultimately generative AI is still a computer and computers want nothing more than to make us happy but we need to ask them for what we want correctly and this is an example of that the more specific and targeted are prompts the better the output is going to get and we have some more of these Maps more of this weathered style I actually like this one I like that there's kind of this foggy area around that that makes it feel much more serious and you'll notice here that I have the option to save this share it download it and it's from here I may move it into something like a Photoshop where I can continue to edit it and work on it and I think this will be a great cover or companion piece to our story so before I go to the next one I'm curious uh Fede or Corey are there any questions in the chat I'm taking a look uh seems like we are answering them as they come so we're good all right fantastic I'll just keep keep on keeping on them all right all right this is actually a really good thing to know so you'll notice that this hasn't loaded for me yet I can just go over here and say restore default workspace and that will allow me to see this applet again so the next thing we're going to be talking about is audio based generative AI this is something I think is both really cool and probably one of the most interestingly challenging gerund of AIT utilize compared to image and text so this is something that can be used in things like Music Creation audio creation um while we're getting into some of those ethical considerations think about how different artists have very distinct musical styles so if you're creating generative music are you allowed to say I want this to sound like a Bob Dylan song where that's an artist who has a very specific sound and feel to his music there was a really interesting case uh fairly recently of someone posting a song on Spotify that sounded like a Drake and the weekend song and it was entirely made through generative music where it's less ethically messy is if you're um a video editor if you are trying to maybe get started with mixing music and playing around with that yourself it's a great way of quickly creating a background track to take and then use as a base to work on so similar as this create a calming song and we have this recording here I was fortunate enough to get a um trial into music LM which is Google's attempt at getting started with gerund of music it's free and it's very fun to play around with so the reason why I said this was interestingly challenging is you know our our eyes are our primary sets right so we're very good at describing things we see and we're very good at communicating so for asking for a text or asking for an image we intuitively know how to be very exact in what we ask for I do not have a particularly strong background in music theory so I can't ask this program to be specific you know to ask for it to be in a certain chord or something like that I don't know how to do that but what I find really cool about this tool is that it can work within a certain mood so I had that up there before but I'm going to say a happy song um with an adventurous tune good for exploring a jungle and I'm going to see how it does with that it's going to give it a moment of looking and I actually like this quite a bit um I apologize I'm not sure if you're able to hear the audio on your end but it came in a really interesting way what I do find with the music LM is it can sound a little tinny which is really interesting to me I'm not sure why that is but again this is where you can take this download this track and go forward I'll also add that there's a really cool um rating system that they have this is how they're training their AI so for every prompt you actually get two song objects and I actually like this one more so I'm going to give it a trophy got a little confetti oh all right um I'm glad to hear that you were able to hear it and from here you can click it and download it or send feedback and continue to work on it all right so let's go back over to the course oh so right now um I now have my text I have my cover and I have background music to play now there's other things I could do I could get a voice to text to read it out although most voice text tools are not guarant of AI they may use AI button um sharing of AI is a fairly specific thing and I may want to create a video which would be the next slide now I am not um going to take you through that process just because video editing is obviously a more extensive process we would be here for the next hour as I click through and check audio levels that's not going to be fun for anyone but I will talk a little bit Ah I think it's having a little trouble because I'm zoomed in that's okay so this is really interesting though and there's been a lot of very interesting controversy around uh the applications of AI and video you know there was um Prince's likeness being used during the Super Bowl in Minnesota a couple of years ago a lot of this um current strike in Hollywood is around actors being paid a lump sum to have their AI likeness used in perpetuity by Studios and what does that mean and that's a really interesting place of what we're talking about in a bit which is this intersection of new technology and ethics of what does a technology like this represent for people's labor for their control over their likeness um these are things that will have to consider over the coming years and we'll have to figure out a lot very quickly on the plus side generative AI videos boost productivity it allows you to create things faster and will likely lead to furthering this you know really incredible artistic explosion we've seen since YouTube was invented of this democratization of Art and in overall increase in quality so I'm I'm really excited to see what generated video can do as long as we're using it in a way that isn't uh alienated for people and that is something if you're someone who is considering using generative video themselves um to consider all right risks and limitations of Darren of AI I really like this and this is something I'll say is really important to us at code academy is as I've said a couple times this technology is really exciting and there's so much it can do in so much it will do uh as a transformative thing but we need to also understand it for what it is so that we don't overly rely on it or use it irresponsibly so the first thing I'll say is at least for now these AIS view any information that's input into them equally so it won't necessarily know what information is private versus what information is public that you would put in so you'll know this when I was creating this story I didn't add the names of my nephews I also didn't add a picture of them when I was playing around with an Island map for Dolly that's because there's a chance that once I click in that information that now lives within the generative Ai and may be used in future models there's a lot of controversy right now um I was reading even this morning that the New York Times may be suing open AI because of how much chat CBT was trained on the New York Times articles I've also seen comic artists who have very specific Styles or viewpoints have their work used through generative AI by different groups maybe groups who don't represent their political Outlook or social Outlook but it still looks like their work so there's a lot of interesting conversations right now going on of again like how do we use this correctly and responsibly I'll also add this in terms of data so tactivities are really a good tool for coding we actually have a case study up right now on how to debug your code using chat gbt or how to simulate paired programming with chat gbt that's something we'll be having out on the website within the next couple of weeks but keep in mind any codes you put on to chat TPT now lives there and is now within that system so if there is code that is unique to yourself or unique to the organization that you work for you really should not be testing it within uh chat gbt another limitation to talk about is hallucination so Hallucination is something really interesting to me because it's something that feels very alien but is actually something humans do as well in that what this machine does what DDT does and other alternative AI is that it looks for patterns and then takes those patterns and says okay based off these patterns I am going to come to these conclusions and it doesn't know if it's true or false it just knows that within the pattern it would make sense for that to be true so it's the same way of you know maybe looking at something and saying okay um so I Ferris wheels um thinking okay that is was probably invented by a guy named Ferris which by the way it was but if it wasn't that would be a hallucination of because it's a word and then a thing after it I am going to assume okay actually the better example uh if I'm using duct tape there is no uh Mr or miss duck in the world it's just called duct tape so that would be a human hallucination a pattern misunderstanding and the problem with cat gbt is that it will deliver this information factually so this is why while something like this is a very useful research tool in a limited capacity um you shouldn't use it to make more complex decisions so to give an example I recently wanted to take my wife out for a date in Queens where I live so I asked for 10 data ideas in Queens for under thirty dollars and I promise I'm generally not cheap I was just curious to see what would come from it and what came out was a lot of different answers but not everything was in Queens some was in Brooklyn someone was in Manhattan because what it probably did was look at hundreds if not thousands of websites that have fun date idea or fun cheap date idea lists in New York City and didn't narrow it down correctly so the process of verification is very important when using generative AI for doing any kind of research if you're doing something like what I just did which is a more creative exercise that's fine don't have to worry about that as much um but definitely if you're doing something for work all right and last is these ethical questions which I've been talking about throughout so things like where does work begin and end and how this credit for that work work we are actually talking about this a lot internally at codecademy so at I help manage something called codecademy docs which is an open contribution tool and we've had discussions internally of if someone submits something that was created by a generated AI did they write it and we've had conversations and we still are not 100 happy with the answer that we have which is if someone used generative AI as a base and then augmented it and made it their own to a point that it's their own work that's fine but that vagueness of at what point does it go from being more artificially intelligently created versus human created is a very interesting and sticky question that will probably be working through for a while again going back to the writer strike just because that's such a big thing in our cultural conversation right now if someone gets an idea for a TV episode from gerund of AI and then writes it do they get credit for that idea um think about highly serialized shows like a law and order or Chicago Fire or an um Gray's Anatomy generative AI could probably write at least the beginning of a script for those shows because they've been going for so long there's a certain flow and feel to those scripts so what does it mean for things like that in the future there's also issues of data and how it's interpreted so chat TBT again doesn't make assumptions it merely takes things in and outputs what it sees in terms of the patterns so if it's looking at things like government data things like that and ask for reports it will not be able to look at it through a human lens only um through exactly what it seats so there's a lot of stuff where we don't again go through the trouble of verifying checking coming to our own conclusions it can lead to um incomplete views of the world thank you for someone who said duct that was I I actually uh questioned myself and I was like is it duck or ducked it is ducked but again there's no Mr dot as far as I'm aware or misstocked all right so that is the overview of the course but again we have a lot of other really great AI content both for introductory levels like our case studies our um docs entries we have tutorial articles we have our intro to chat TPT course we have a lot of great content we also have more advanced AI content um that you can check out on our site we have an AI Hub it's awesome I would highly encourage you to check it out so that's everything for my presentation so if um buddy if you want to do any questions we can use that time for you know next 10 minutes absolutely thank you so much for the presentation that was awesome very instructive I think everybody enjoyed it in the chat uh yeah so I'm going to just ask the chat to collect their thoughts and think about questions that they want to ask you I'll be reading them through as they come in and then Adam you can give us your thoughts and your takes on the questions from the audience so please do share them in the chat I will ask you a question of my own while we wait for people to submit their own questions and I was wondering looking at generative Ai and how the term AI in general is thrown around uh you touched on this during the representation that generative AI is different it's very specific type of AI so do you see that uh misconceptions of what AI does between the different types or like different flavors of AI is that something that you see people confusing and maybe leading up to uh maybe using AI wrong like it's an amazing tool but you still need to know what is it that is going to give you what to expect that's a really interesting question father um I would say it's there's two aspects to it right which is people are using generative AI machine learning in AI interchangeably a lot of the time and they're not interchangeable so we had AI in our lives for a really long time um maybe just not in ways we see or ways we think about so for example on a lot of our smartphones we have a Siri or you know a Google Assistant Siri actually just turned on for me so that that's on me um helping out and it will creep me out when my phone will say hey it's um 6 a.m like you usually take you know you eat at this time so like do you want to eat breakfast and that's so creepy but it's just pattern recognition and that's the kind of thing that AI is good for is that I'll put them into my calendar a lot like eat breakfast or I'll you know um a better example would be on Thursdays at six o'clock I call my parents and I might get a reminder for my phone to call my parents that's AI or the ranking we see on social media of knowing how to kind of curate our feed a certain way is an AI being used that's not a generative AI it's not as smart as what we see but it is an implementation of that um machine learning I don't have the strongest background in admittedly um but I'll say again it's a use of large uh amounts of data to come to different conclusions it's not necessarily generative there's perhaps more of a human component in there in terms of how people think about it we're already seeing companies um lay off certain employees because they think they'll be able to replace some with gerund of AI I think they're going to be sorely surprised um how much they miss people because I think it this will not destroy jobs so much as displaced them so it's not that a job will fundamentally disappear it's that perhaps a starting job as a copywriter you'll be doing a lot more copy editing of content that I generated AI created which is ultimately in my opinion probably a little bit more interesting work you're thinking a little bit more strategically about content um but I think people are in a little bit of a rush to say this is going to like utterly change the world I I don't think we're there quite yet okay fair enough thank you for your answer I see a question in the chat from Matthew uh has someone who is learning to program at the present moment would you recommend using the AI to assist with code now on an early stage of learning or learn to write code without a without Ai and use it later that's such an interesting question um I've wondered about this a lot myself of everyone remembers being in math class and being told hey well everyone over 25 26 remembers being in math class and being told you're not going to have a calculator everywhere you go so you need to learn how to do math this way and surprise we have calculators on us everywhere we go and I do wonder is that going to be the case with coding of there's so much that's going to be taking care of you through the generative AI that um the amount you'll have to learn or how you'll learn will be different well I will say though if we stay within this math example is even if you are using a calculator you still need number sense you still need to know the rules of math and how different equations relate to each other for how to implement them so I would say if you are just getting started out learning to code it's still important to learn how that code Works what's unique about that language what it does um and the Mechanics for it before going to generative AI because if you go to Giant of AI immediately you'll be more using something without fully understanding it and especially if you plan to work as a programmer that puts you in a very vulnerable position it sounds to me a little bit like the analogy of the bicycle and walking where the bicycle will make you move faster but you still need to know where you're going I love that um I was also thinking it's like the difference between knowing how to drive from a car and being a mechanic uh um I know it has four wheels but I couldn't I think it's very selfexplanatory for anyone that thinks that AI can do it all if you just don't have like you said any knowledge any sense of the code I becomes very obvious very quickly that you you're not going to get very far tools uh let's see looking at the chat somebody said generative AI doesn't always give facts but rather recognizes patterns this can become very convincing how can we ensure that we don't fully believe it I guess the question is about how to vet the answers you're getting from AI how do you know because it can be very convincing sometimes it's just you know the AI sounds like it knows what it's talking about yeah um this may come as a surprise to people but sometimes there's misinformation on the internet just in general um and again this is the former history teacher in me of it's always good to verify information and we know there are certain sources that are more trustworthy there are the Wikipedia is actually shockingly trustworthy in a lot of ways um respected news organizations uh scientific journals that we can check in on information I would say again it depends what kind of information you're looking for if you're a look if you are planning um a vacation and you're just looking at things to do in Dallas that's probably fine you don't have to worry about it too much maybe if you plan to book something you'll end up verifying it that way however if you are looking up something um more scientific then yes you shouldn't or certain treatments for something first of all call a doctor don't use generative AI to treat a cult um but also make sure to verify I'll also say I feel like some people are worried about that when they talk about Job displacement what if there is a cheaper medical tier which is AI enabled and for and to talk to a real human you have to get through an AI first right so that that is really interesting um give me a moment so a uh podcast I listen to It's called philosophize this did a um the host is a man named Stephen West he did a whole episode on gerund of AI and its meaning and he actually talked about medicine specifically and how there could be really exciting applications in that there are just so many doctors in the world and you do see kind of a natural um choke point in that you have a lot of people that need care and only a certain amount of doctors who can provide that care and we don't have it now but maybe in five years ten years there will be a generative AI that is sufficiently trained to accurately provide um medical advice to people at least for lowlevel things so that doctors can focus on bigger concerns I'm thinking specifically of um a family member who recently had a child and has been calling my poor cousin who's a pediatrician every two days saying is this normal is this normal is this normal having a generative AI tool that's trained to reliably help provide medical information would really be a game changer for situations like that but again we are not there yet another jail right I think we are this might be related to what we're just talking about a little bit uh there was a user in the chat asking about the degradation of AI by saying if AI generated content enters the data sets the future AIS will be trained on do you have some sort of vicious spiral where the data just keeps getting worse and worse because it's you know it's sort of feeding itself have you have you read into this do you do you think that this could become a problem no but that's scary um again it's one of those things of we just need to be mindful of the pitfalls with any new technology and build robust systems to incorporate it and use it responsibly like maybe this means um and I've had conversations with people on our data science team um about this that we need to be really disciplined about having clean clear data before inputting anything into a generative AI which is again something we should be doing anyway and is a big problem in the field of data is bad data so we're kind of there already so it's it's more of a matter of again like making sure we adapt in a responsible way and I think in terms of it being a spiral I don't know about that I could definitely see it getting worse before it gets better because humans are reactive we like to create a problem for ourselves before we solve it but I don't think it will cause you know some kind of data apocalypse uh going on about the pattern recognition that you talked to during the presentation someone is asking in the chat if generative AI could be used to leverage business Analytics so I guess the field of statistics and math is something that ji jnai can work on um yeah so this is where I was talking about different types of tooling so chat EBT can do very basic things so in my own work I think a lot about search engine optimization so how well things rank on Google and you can go on chat gbt and say what are best practices for SEO and it will give you something pretty good I can't go into chat TBT and say give me a full SEO strategy based off like these metrics in the company because one I'd be giving chat to BT a lot of information about code academy that I shouldn't be and to it doesn't know enough about the specifics of our context to give good information in terms of business analytics that's a long way of me saying yes I imagine there is Jared toong that could do that very well it would likely be a paid tool and we're in a bit of a wild west era where maybe in a year or two years there will be a tool with that sophisticated um to be able to do that if there is I don't know of it yet nice I think it reminds me do you feel like this is a bit like the revolution with computers back in the 80s or the 90s where computers were getting fast enough that they they were actually useful to solve scientific questions and problems and simulations and at the time uh there was this problem where you not you didn't always know why the computer was giving you the answer it was so it became very important for scientists at the time to know how to how to ask the right question so you would know that is answering your question and it's not just spitting out numbers that you're not really sure what you know if they're actually about what you asked the computer so do you see some similarities with that nowadays with AI where the ability to craft a good prompt and to know the limits of AI and how far that prompt is gonna go how it's going to be interpreted uh it's almost as important as knowing how to use the tool itself uh like your example with uh looking for restaurants in Brooklyn but I can only say yes that was a great I agree yeah um I think that makes complete sense and it's also that these Technologies happen in stages um where they typically start off invented existing being used in very specific Circles of specialists and then you get to where we are where certain applications are found potential is understood and the next phase is building out that infrastructure and systems of use that will allow it to fully be employed in the general population and be as transformative as it has the potential to be so to go way back you know people knew the steam engine was a big deal when it was invented there was another 50 years before we had railroads so we are in the steam engine moment um I'm very interested to see what the railroads will look like fair enough someone was asking about completing code academy courses and then what so um thinking about the AI content that we've released recently we have several courses on it uh how do you see somebody is this sort of do you see these AI courses uh something that goes alongside of machine learning and data science courses do you think that is something complementary or something that should come before or after how do you see the the catalog for somebody that is data curious I guess I think that's a that's really interesting I I would say it depends what you want your outcome to be so if you are just looking to understand what generative AI is um I full you can take these courses do these case studies to see how you might implement it in your work and in your life and that may be enough um how we're thinking of it and how we hope to evolve our curriculum over the rest of the year is to really find a way to work it into your workflows and practices be it as a programmer or a data scientist or a cyber security specialist so we'll um we just put out a new data science course Alicia if you could actually put that in um the chat that covers aspects of data science and AI um I'd also say things like machine learning would be a direction to go in if you're interested in the nittygritty of how it works I would say regardless and you know if you're not doing this already I would encourage you to do so in the chat think about those moments at work and recognizing them as okay this is a place where I could use gerund of AI to make my life a little bit easier and then you can start working to establish yourself on your team in your company as a leader who understands how to use this and put yourself in a real position to be successful in that way okay well I think that I was very solid advice for anyone trying to get into the data field so we have run out of time for Q a and I want to thank everybody for attending today's live stream if you've attended or part one or part two of our series thank you again for coming back for part three if you haven't please check out our
