00:00 - my name is Maggie I am a web and graphic
00:03 - designer from the Philadelphia area
00:05 - today we are going to explore why we
00:09 - would want to clone a web site and how
00:13 - would we go about doing this let's begin
00:17 - with the why why would we want to clone
00:20 - a web site or portions of a web site
00:23 - through cloning a web site we can copy
00:26 - we can view the code associated with
00:30 - that web site this can be a great
00:33 - starting point for designers and
00:35 - developers from here we can modify and
00:38 - develop a web site without having to
00:41 - write the code from scratch cloning
00:43 - portions of a web site really can be a
00:46 - great starting point we are not
00:50 - encouraging you to just go and copy an
00:53 - entire web site and call it your own we
00:56 - always want to be cognizant of
00:58 - plagiarism copyright issues and IP theft
01:02 - so how do we go about cloning a website
01:05 - there are a lot of different ways in
01:07 - this video we're going to take a look at
01:10 - the chrome development tools and we're
01:12 - going to see that they are a great
01:13 - resource to inspect the code and to
01:17 - clone and copy all of the code or just
01:20 - pieces of the code let's try it out we
01:26 - come to Coke add amis platform and we
01:29 - find tortoiseshell optics this project
01:32 - is a responsive design web building
01:35 - project so I take a closer look at the
01:38 - finished project and I want to find the
01:41 - finished code I select one of the
01:44 - elements do a right-click control click
01:46 - and choose inspect here I have opened
01:49 - Google Chrome development tools on the
01:52 - top I can see the HTML as I scroll
01:55 - through I can see the different sections
01:57 - of my page from my header all the way
02:00 - down to the footer as I select my
02:02 - different elements I can also see the
02:05 - CSS here I see the CSS for the footer
02:09 - and for the item with the class of
02:12 - container
02:13 - I can see the max with the margins
02:15 - information on the background color I
02:18 - can choose different elements and take a
02:21 - closer look at the CSS I can change the
02:24 - color if I'd like to when we change the
02:27 - color these changes will only be when
02:29 - reviewing them once we refresh our page
02:31 - these changes will go away we know that
02:35 - if we gave everyone the ability to
02:36 - change the look of a website that this
02:39 - wouldn't work but we can from the Google
02:43 - Chrome development tools copy the code
02:45 - and use it on our local hard drive on
02:49 - our computer or we could take it and
02:51 - clone it and use it in a different
02:52 - project as I move through the Chrome
02:55 - development tools I can see that I have
02:58 - the option to open the file when I
03:01 - choose open file I'm going to see all of
03:04 - the files that are associated with this
03:06 - page I know that the CSS for this page
03:10 - is Styles dot CSS I could select all of
03:13 - this CSS and copy it and put it into my
03:18 - text editor and use the CSS if I wanted
03:22 - to find the index.html if I wanted to
03:25 - find the HTML I would type in index and
03:28 - for this project this will bring me to
03:31 - the HTML for this landing page
03:35 - tortoise-shell optics again I could copy
03:40 - and paste this HTML and put it on my
03:44 - computer and use it in my text editor
03:47 - now let's come to a website like Twitter
03:50 - let's say that we wanted to clone we
03:53 - wanted to use some of the HTML the CSS
03:56 - the JavaScript that is accompanying this
03:59 - page and we can clone some of the
04:02 - features from this site I come to the
04:06 - about page and I see that I have this
04:08 - feature what's happening in the world
04:10 - and what people are talking about right
04:12 - now again what I can do is I can select
04:15 - this heading and I can do a ctrl click
04:19 - or right click and inspect the element
04:22 - and this will open up Google Chrome
04:25 - development tools
04:27 - as I take a closer look I can see the
04:29 - HTML and the accompanying CSS with this
04:33 - page when I take a closer look into CSS
04:35 - I see the name of the CSS sheet
04:39 - associated with this page I see that
04:43 - this line is it wrapped in an h1 tag and
04:47 - that it has the class of live type
04:51 - masthead headline type bold 36 color
04:55 - neutral white as I scroll down I can
04:59 - locate the JavaScript files associated
05:02 - with this site and open these files to
05:05 - find the code associated with the
05:08 - JavaScript features on this page I am
05:11 - going to open content dot j s n about
05:16 - dash home dot j s once i open these
05:20 - files i can clone the code for the
05:23 - features of this site for the features
05:25 - of that element on the page as we take a
05:29 - closer look at a website like twitter
05:31 - we're going to find that there will be a
05:33 - lot of pages associated with this
05:36 - website as well as a lot of code we use
05:39 - tortoiseshell optics as our first
05:41 - example because it was a very simple
05:43 - website with a CSS sheet and an HTML
05:47 - sheet as we get into more robust sites
05:50 - like twitter will find that there will
05:53 - be more files associated with this page
05:59 - let's take a look at how we would copy
06:02 - the source code for a site like Twitter
06:04 - I open up Google Chrome development
06:06 - tools and I can see all of the HTML for
06:10 - this page I'm going to click sources and
06:14 - then I'll see the HTML one more time and
06:16 - now I can select it and copy it I can
06:20 - see that there is an awful lot of lines
06:22 - of HTML with Twitter site once I have it
06:26 - all selected I'll choose edit copy I
06:29 - come to a text editor of my choice now I
06:34 - have actually created a folder on my
06:36 - computer and named it oh one Twitter I'm
06:39 - going to come to file new and I am going
06:44 - to paste the HTML into this sheet I'm
06:48 - going to save as index.html now let's
06:52 - get the CSS I can come to elements and I
06:56 - see the CSS in the middle of my Chrome
06:59 - development tools I can click main CSS
07:02 - one and in the source
07:04 - I see the code here now it looks like
07:08 - there's just one line but I'm going to
07:10 - find that there's an awful lot of
07:12 - information here and that the code has
07:15 - gotten a bit jumbled so I'm going to
07:19 - copy all of this code as I move around I
07:24 - can see that I have selected all of the
07:27 - CSS again I'll choose edit copy and I'll
07:32 - come back to my text editor and I'll
07:35 - create my CSS sheet I'll come to file
07:37 - new and I'm going to paste my CSS my CSS
07:47 - has come in very jumbled I'm not going
07:51 - to worry about that right now though I'm
07:54 - going to come file save as and I'm going
07:59 - to give the name of main CSS I'll hit
08:02 - save now I'm going to come back to my
08:06 - index.html and I'm going to come to the
08:09 - head of this document
08:12 - I want to make sure that I set the path
08:15 - to link main.css
08:17 - to the local file on my computer as I
08:20 - take a closer look to I can see the name
08:22 - of the JavaScript files that are
08:24 - attached to Twitter's website I'm
08:27 - focusing on the CSS right now so I'm
08:29 - going to come on in and again I will not
08:32 - have this path that is located now in
08:35 - href I come to file save and let's take
08:38 - a look and see what we have to the left
08:41 - of my computer I have the path to the
08:44 - file index.html that is on my computer
08:46 - the local project and to the right I can
08:50 - see that I am actually on Twitter's web
08:52 - page let's compare the two I start
08:55 - coming down and as I take a closer look
08:57 - I can see the different pieces that are
09:00 - not there I can see that the color has
09:04 - traveled my type
09:07 - has traveled what I have begun to do is
09:10 - build out the structure the HTML and the
09:14 - CSS and as I take a closer look I can
09:18 - see the different features where I'll
09:20 - need the Java scripts let's take a look
09:22 - at editing some of the HTML and the CSS
09:25 - so if I was using this project and
09:28 - building a website based on Twitter's
09:30 - design I might begin right with the
09:33 - navbar
09:33 - as I take a closer look at my header I
09:37 - can see that I have my nav icon and that
09:42 - I come into my nav menu I can come
09:45 - through the first part within the span
09:47 - tags that says let's go Twitter I am
09:50 - going to change this I'm going to type
09:55 - let's clone I can see all of the
09:59 - different things that I'd want to come
10:01 - in and change but for this video we're
10:03 - just going to scratch the surface
10:05 - let's save in preview I refresh and I've
10:09 - changed it to let's clone as I start
10:13 - looking around the source code of a site
10:16 - like Twitter there is a lot of
10:17 - information there so I will take it
10:20 - piece by piece I want to change a bit of
10:23 - the background color and as I scrolled
10:25 - through I know
10:25 - that there are multiple background
10:27 - colors I am going to use the development
10:30 - tools one more time to figure out what
10:33 - part of the CSS I am going to target so
10:36 - I open back up Twitter
10:37 - I have twitter.com and then I have the
10:40 - copied source code that's on my computer
10:43 - I want to figure out what this
10:46 - background color what the class name is
10:49 - for the CSS of this background color so
10:52 - again I'm going to do a ctrl click and
10:55 - I'm going to inspect this elements and
10:59 - as I come in I can see on main dot CSS
11:03 - that the rule is background color dark
11:05 - blue let me change this color let's go
11:08 - for pink what I could do as well is I
11:13 - could actually copy this line right here
11:16 - with the change that I have made I am
11:19 - going to come to edit copy now I'm going
11:22 - to come back to my text editor I am
11:26 - going to take this rule and create
11:27 - another CSS sheet I'm going to name the
11:30 - sheet child dot CSS I'm going to paste
11:34 - this rule here and come to file save as
11:39 - child dot CSS I'm going to put my rules
11:43 - on a separate sheet this way I can keep
11:46 - the code better organized I'm going to
11:49 - come back to my index.html and make sure
11:51 - that this CSS sheet is also attached I'm
11:55 - going to select the line of code that
11:57 - has main dot CSS linked for the CSS I'm
12:02 - going to come after that line of code
12:04 - I'm going to paste I will change the
12:06 - link to child dot CSS I need to make
12:10 - sure that I put my second CSS sheet
12:12 - below main dot CSS this way the new
12:16 - rules that I'm making will override the
12:18 - rules in main dot CSS I come to file
12:21 - save all and I'll preview again to the
12:24 - left I have the index.html that is on my
12:27 - computer that is in the local folder and
12:30 - to the right Twitter's website that's
12:32 - live on the web
12:33 - I've made two very basic changes to this
12:37 - website and we familiar
12:39 - our self with how we go about finding
12:41 - the source code and copying and pasting
12:44 - it to a folder on our computer you may
12:48 - be interested in recreating a site and
12:50 - not cloning it if so check out our video

my name is Maggie I am a web and graphic designer from the Philadelphia area today we are going to explore why we would want to clone a web site and how would we go about doing this let's begin with the why why would we want to clone a web site or portions of a web site through cloning a web site we can copy we can view the code associated with that web site this can be a great starting point for designers and developers from here we can modify and develop a web site without having to write the code from scratch cloning portions of a web site really can be a great starting point we are not encouraging you to just go and copy an entire web site and call it your own we always want to be cognizant of plagiarism copyright issues and IP theft so how do we go about cloning a website there are a lot of different ways in this video we're going to take a look at the chrome development tools and we're going to see that they are a great resource to inspect the code and to clone and copy all of the code or just pieces of the code let's try it out we come to Coke add amis platform and we find tortoiseshell optics this project is a responsive design web building project so I take a closer look
