04:51 - specialize in helping new grads young
04:53 - professionals and career pivoter like
04:56 - yourselves uh as fed said I have pivoted
04:59 - my own career three times more on that
05:03 - later I live on the beautiful coast of
05:06 - Southern Maine my husband and I recently
05:09 - bought a house and we joke that half the
05:11 - reason we bought this house was for our
05:12 - dog to have a house so you could say
05:15 - that I am a dog Enthusiast feel free to
05:17 - check out my about page on my website
05:19 - for a photo of my
05:22 - pup okay so let's dive into our main
05:25 - topic for the
05:28 - day so what is
05:32 - pivoting no it is not this and hopefully
05:35 - not as stressful as this for those who
05:37 - don't know this is one of the most
05:38 - iconic scenes in the TV show Friends one
05:41 - of my
05:42 - favorites but in all seriousness here is
05:45 - how author and career strategist Jenny
05:48 - Blake defines it in her book titled
05:51 - pivot a career pivot means doubling down
05:54 - on what is working to make a purposeful
05:57 - shift in a new related Direction
06:00 - pivoting is intent is an intentional and
06:03 - methodical process for nimbly navigating
06:05 - career
06:07 - changes so pivoting means changing
06:09 - careers but it could be a small pivot
06:12 - like from copywriter to copy editor or a
06:15 - really big pivot like from high school
06:18 - history teacher to data scientist in
06:21 - both cases the pivoter learns to
06:23 - leverage their current skills and
06:25 - knowledge build new skills and knowledge
06:28 - and take purposeful steps towards their
06:30 - career goal and it is true that some
06:33 - jobs require a specific degree where you
06:36 - have to go back to school to make a
06:38 - career change for example a lot of
06:40 - healthc care professions but many many
06:42 - don't in particular the tech industry
06:46 - and we're going to focus on those jobs
06:51 - today so let me tell you about my
06:54 - pivoting story to set the stage a little
06:57 - bit after earning money my bachelor's in
07:00 - psychology which I really enjoyed
07:02 - studying I had a great job at the
07:05 - American Psychological Association in
07:07 - Washington DC so naturally I did what
07:10 - any sane person would do I went back to
07:12 - school for two years to study sign
07:15 - language
07:16 - interpreting I was in this field for
07:18 - seven years and after graduating from my
07:21 - interpreting program I worked as a
07:23 - project manager at a local University
07:26 - sign language department and I did
07:28 - freelance interpreting as a side gig as
07:31 - well I also earned my MBA while working
07:34 - at this University and over the years I
07:36 - realized that I was interested in the
07:39 - language but not much else related to
07:41 - this particular profession it was the
07:44 - wrong fit because I only focused on my
07:46 - interest in the subject matter and not
07:48 - all the aspects that made up this career
07:52 - I realized at that time that other than
07:54 - interpreting the only other major skill
07:56 - on my resume was project management for
07:59 - my time at the University so after I
08:02 - left my current job I became surprise
08:06 - surprise a project manager basically by
08:09 - default which is also not a great way to
08:11 - make a career decision but as a super
08:14 - organized type a person I thought this
08:17 - would be a great fit for me and I was
08:19 - good at it but again over time I
08:21 - realized that while I liked the
08:23 - organizational aspect of the job it
08:26 - didn't allow for much Freedom or
08:27 - creativity which I came to learn are
08:30 - things that are important to
08:32 - me so at that time I reflected on my
08:35 - time working at the University and I
08:38 - realized that what I enjoyed most was
08:40 - the educational content that we were
08:42 - building I loved working with adult
08:45 - Learners helping them improve their
08:47 - skills and this led to a much more
08:50 - strategic career move into instructional
08:54 - design or the broader field of Learning
08:57 - and
08:58 - Development this this was the first time
09:00 - that I thoughtfully planned my Pivot
09:02 - from one career to the next and it
09:05 - worked in my current project management
09:08 - role at a real estate company I asked
09:10 - for opportunities to develop internal
09:12 - training for my team and then I actually
09:15 - got laid off when covid hit but that was
09:17 - okay because I knew where I wanted to
09:19 - Pivot to next I then got a job as a
09:23 - project manager at an educational
09:25 - company one step closer to being in the
09:27 - field of Learning and Development and
09:30 - again I asked for opportunities to build
09:32 - and run internal team training I also
09:34 - spent time on the side earning
09:36 - instructional design certifications
09:39 - networking with others in the field and
09:41 - even volunteering as a learning and
09:42 - development manager to beef up my resume
09:46 - I finally landed my first job as an
09:48 - instructional designer for the federal
09:50 - government and I knew that the
09:52 - bureaucratic environment would not be a
09:54 - great fit for me long term but I took
09:56 - the job as an opportunity to gain
09:58 - instructional design experience before
10:01 - landing The Learning and Development job
10:03 - that I'm in
10:04 - today and then my current job along with
10:08 - my years of experience as a mentor
10:10 - exposed me to the world of coaching and
10:14 - it was the first time I felt like I
10:16 - found something that truly combined
10:18 - everything I was interested in and
10:19 - everything I was good at Psychology
10:22 - helping others adult education business
10:26 - being super organized creativity Etc
10:30 - I knew that my varied background plus my
10:32 - personal experience pivoting careers
10:34 - three times would be valuable to others
10:36 - at the beginning of their career journey
10:38 - and thus launched my career coaching
10:41 - career as you can see my career path has
10:44 - not been straightforward and that is
10:46 - okay over the years New Roads have
10:49 - presented themselves to me and if I were
10:51 - not open-minded to them I would not be
10:53 - where I am
10:54 - today so I learned all the tips and
10:57 - tricks that I'm going to share with you
10:58 - today during my Pivot from project
11:01 - manager to instructional designer so I
11:04 - will focus on this particular part of my
11:06 - journey as I walk through each tip so
11:09 - before we dive into my seven tips I'm
11:11 - going to pause real quick and see if you
11:13 - have any questions so far I'll ask fed
11:16 - if any questions have come up in the
11:18 - chat that we should address at this
11:25 - time love the friends pivoting reference
11:28 - very nice Jonathan
11:42 - all right seems like we're good to move
11:46 - on it is time to talk through my seven
11:49 - tips in a minute I will share a Google
11:52 - doc with you all um with all of the
11:55 - activities that you're going to be doing
11:56 - today and you can make a copy of the
11:58 - document and write out your answers as
12:01 - we go I promise that these activities
12:03 - will be useful to you so I really do
12:05 - hope you participate in
12:08 - them these tips will be broken up into
12:11 - two parts the first part is the
12:13 - preparation you do before you are ready
12:15 - to Pivot and the second part is when you
12:19 - are ready to make that pivot happen
12:21 - let's start with
12:26 - preparation the first tip is to take a
12:29 - minute to pause and
12:31 - reflect this might seem trivial but it
12:33 - is vital to
12:35 - developing a Clear Vision and Direction
12:39 - you might already know exactly what
12:41 - career you want to Pivot into but do you
12:43 - know why this career path interests you
12:47 - pivoting takes time and effort so it's
12:49 - important to be intentional and
12:52 - methodical about exactly what you are
12:54 - aiming for as Jenny Blake described in
12:56 - that previous quote so ask
13:01 - s why am I interested in pivoting
13:03 - careers what problem are you trying to
13:05 - solve or what Vision are you trying to
13:08 - manifest for
13:10 - yourself what does a successful career
13:14 - look like to me what are you aiming for
13:17 - or how how will you know when you've
13:19 - gotten
13:21 - there what do I fear or what is holding
13:24 - me
13:25 - back career moves are scary and it's
13:28 - totally normal to be anxious about it
13:30 - it's important to understand your fears
13:32 - so that you can face them headon and
13:34 - they don't get the best of
13:36 - you and what am I willing to sacrifice
13:39 - to make this pivot happen when you say
13:42 - yes to something you are saying no to
13:44 - basically everything else so what are
13:47 - you willing to do and what are you not
13:48 - willing to do to land this new career
13:52 - when I realize that project management
13:54 - wasn't for me I reflected on all the
13:56 - other aspects of my job that I enjoyed
13:59 - I reflected on what was missing that I
14:02 - needed what I was good at
14:04 - Etc and uh this deep reflection helped
14:07 - me recognize that instructional design
14:09 - was a better fit for
14:10 - me I'd also like to add that if you have
14:13 - no idea what you want to do next you can
14:17 - watch another webinar that I've done
14:19 - that is called passion is overrated
14:21 - which I will drop in the chat now um you
14:25 - are also welcome as I said before to
14:27 - book a free career coaching consult a
14:29 - with me I will put both of these in the
14:34 - chat
14:35 - now sorry if they got a little bit funky
14:40 - looking okay
14:43 - cool before we start our first activity
14:47 - I will put the activity sheet in the
14:49 - chat for you all to open and to make a
14:55 - copy this is a Google doc that you
14:59 - should be able to open and make a copy
15:01 - of so you're welcome to make a copy by

15:13 - answers for each activity the one thing
15:16 - that I ask is that you don't read ahead
15:18 - and start working on activities before
15:20 - we get to them you will get a lot more
15:23 - out of this training if you stay in the
15:25 - present moment and after the webinar is

15:56 - sheet and
15:57 - then here is the webinar on passion is
16:01 - overrated and here is the free
16:02 - consultation link I think that's
16:05 - everything thank you for catching that
16:08 - sorry about that
16:11 - everybody okay all right so like I said
16:15 - feel free to make a copy um please don't
16:17 - read ahead but uh uh we're going to get
16:20 - to everything so don't worry about it
16:22 - also if you um are having having trouble
16:24 - with the document or you just don't want
16:25 - to use it that's totally fine you are

16:40 - the the activity sheet is helpful
16:42 - because it includes instructions for
16:43 - each activity but I will also display
16:45 - those on the screen so not a requirement
16:47 - that you use it hopefully that worked
16:50 - for you all so let's start our very
16:52 - first
16:57 - activity okay let's take about 3 minutes
17:01 - to answer these reflection questions
17:03 - that I just shared why am I interested
17:05 - in pivoting careers what does a
17:08 - successful career look like to me what
17:10 - am I afraid of what am I willing to
17:12 - sacrifice or not sacrifice I realize
17:15 - that these are loaded questions so just
17:18 - write down a few words for each the
17:20 - first thing that comes to your mind you
17:22 - are always welcome to revisit these
17:24 - activities after our live stream is over
17:26 - my goal is to just give you a taste of
17:29 - each tip and each step in the pivoting
17:31 - process so that you have the tools you
17:33 - need to continue working on your pivot
17:35 - after this training is over so I will
17:38 - play some music and set a timer for 3
17:41 - minutes and I'll let you know when that
17:42 - timer is
17:57 - up
20:32 - about 30
20:42 - [Music]
20:57 - seconds
20:59 - [Music]
21:12 - okay welcome back I'm sure that went by
21:15 - very fast but that's okay I'm sure
21:18 - there's a lot more you could write and
21:20 - you are welcome to continue working on
21:22 - this after the live stream is over and
21:24 - your career Journey should include
21:26 - regular check-ins with yourself to make
21:28 - sure you are on the right path so I
21:30 - highly encourage lots of
21:33 - reflection let's move on to tip number
21:36 - two the next tip is to do your research
21:40 - to identify your knowledge skill and
21:43 - experience gaps this is a big step in
21:46 - the pivoting
21:48 - process so basically research what it
21:50 - takes to succeed in the role that you're
21:52 - interested in the way I went about this
21:55 - when I was looking to Pivot from project
21:56 - management to instructional design
21:59 - was I read lots of job descriptions and
22:03 - noted which knowledge skill and
22:04 - experience gaps I did have and I did not
22:07 - have I researched different Industries
22:11 - sectors and even individual
22:13 - organizations to narrow down what
22:15 - environment I was aiming for I read tons
22:19 - of Articles and blogs and books I
22:22 - watched lots of YouTube videos I
22:24 - listened to podcasts related to my
22:26 - future career and collected as much
22:28 - information as I could and of course I
22:31 - talked to people I conducted a lot of
22:32 - informational interviews which we will
22:34 - talk about in a little bit and I took
22:37 - all of this and I took a bunch of notes
22:40 - to to just gather everything I learned
22:41 - from this research and the goal of this
22:44 - step is really it's
22:46 - twofold the first part is to solidify
22:48 - your direction this is a gut check to
22:51 - make sure that this pivot is actually a
22:53 - smart and viable move and that it still
22:56 - interests you right now which you might
22:57 - learn after your research that it
22:59 - doesn't or something else does and then
23:02 - of course it's also to identify your
23:03 - knowledge skill and experience gaps so
23:06 - then you can work on filling
23:10 - them all right it's already time for our
23:12 - second activity since we don't have time
23:14 - right now to conduct in-depth research
23:16 - we're going to instead focus on the gaps
23:19 - we already know that we have so take
23:21 - about two minutes and write down any
23:24 - knowledge gaps skill gaps or experience
23:27 - gaps that you that you currently have
23:29 - right now and that you know you'll need
23:31 - to fill before pivoting your career so
23:34 - for example if you want to become a
23:36 - coder uh a knowledge Gap might be you
23:39 - don't understand the many different ways
23:42 - that engineers and web developers
23:44 - collaborate or a skill Gap might be you
23:47 - have not learned
23:49 - python or an experience Gap might be
23:52 - that you've never worked in the tech
23:53 - industry before so those are all just
23:55 - some examples to get you thinking again
23:57 - I'm going to play some music and set a
23:59 - timer for about 2
24:09 - [Music]
24:27 - minutes
24:39 - [Music]
24:57 - n
25:15 - [Music]
25:46 - about 30
25:57 - seconds
25:59 - [Music]
26:25 - okay thank you for doing that
26:29 - activity as with all of these activities
26:32 - I welcome you to go back and revisit
26:34 - this after the live stream is over and I
26:36 - highly encourage you to do lots and lots
26:39 - of research so you're well informed
26:41 - about your career pivot but hopefully
26:43 - this activity gave you a good starting
26:45 - point of what gaps you might need to
26:47 - fill before you attempt to Pivot your
26:52 - career so if you are one of the lucky
26:55 - ones and you learned in our last step
26:57 - that you have zero knowledge skill or
27:00 - experience gaps then you are welcome to
27:03 - skip step number three but for the vast
27:05 - majority of us the next step is to
27:08 - upskill ourselves and upskilling means
27:11 - improving your knowledge or your skills
27:14 - or your experience so that you can
27:16 - become a desirable candidate for the
27:19 - position that you're interested in and
27:21 - now that you've identified the major
27:24 - gaps you need to fill it is time to
27:26 - start filling them
27:28 - but luckily there are many free or
27:31 - lowcost options to do this for
27:35 - example
27:36 - books
27:38 - podcasts
27:39 - videos webinars or conferences or events
27:44 - courses and
27:46 - certifications Community groups or
27:49 - mentorship
27:50 - opportunities or code academy I'll let
27:53 - Fede drop some code academy resources in
27:56 - the chat if he'd like and I'd like to
27:59 - point out I'm not listing degree
28:01 - programs I'm not mentioning going back
28:04 - to school there are many lowcost and
28:07 - self-study options available to you that
28:10 - you can start using
28:11 - today and it's up to you how much money
28:14 - you're willing to spend to advance your
28:16 - career but my advice is to weigh the
28:19 - cost of the professional development
28:20 - activity against its benefits that it
28:23 - might provide in landing a new career a
28:26 - better salary improve work life balance
28:29 - Etc so personally I paid for two online
28:34 - certification courses in instructional
28:36 - design which greatly improved my
28:38 - Knowledge and Skills and gave my resume
28:41 - a boost other than that I completed the
28:44 - rest of my upskilling through only the
28:46 - cost of a couple books so for example
28:49 - one of the technical skills that I knew
28:51 - I had to learn was how to use a software
28:54 - called articulate storyline which is an
28:57 - e learning development software for
29:00 - people who are in instructional design I
29:03 - wasn't able to download a free trial
29:05 - since it wouldn't run on a Mac but I do
29:07 - highly recommend free software trials as
29:10 - a great upscaling option so what I did
29:13 - is I watched a bunch of YouTube videos
29:16 - on how to use this particular software
29:19 - until I developed a solid understanding
29:21 - of it and after that I felt confident
29:25 - enough in my ability to master my
29:27 - storylines skills when finally able to
29:29 - get my hands on the software so that I
29:33 - added it to my resume as something I am
29:35 - quote familiar with uh so for this you
29:39 - have to be a good judge of your own
29:41 - abilities and your own capabilities but
29:43 - again ex I I highly recommend gaining
29:46 - exposure to something and then
29:48 - expressing familiarity with it as a
29:50 - great way to give your resume a boost to
29:52 - answer interview questions
29:55 - Etc I'd also like to note that
29:58 - upskilling requires a lot of intrinsic
30:00 - motivation scrappiness and grit if you
30:04 - are a serious if you are serious about
30:06 - changing your career then you need to
30:08 - become a serious student of that
30:10 - particular career and teach yourself
30:13 - what you need to know if this is
30:15 - something that you struggle with
30:17 - consider finding a study buddy that you
30:19 - meet with regularly to hold each other
30:21 - accountable or even better I recommend
30:23 - working with a career
30:26 - coach time for our third activity let's
30:31 - take about two minutes to search for
30:32 - some resources that might help you
30:34 - upskill yourself so for example you
30:37 - could Google videos on how engineers and
30:40 - web developers collaborate or python
30:43 - online
30:44 - courses uh and then note in your
30:46 - document a few resources that catch your
30:47 - eye and that you'd like to explore more
30:50 - after this live stream is over and if
30:52 - you'd like feel free to share one of
30:53 - those resources in the chat so that
30:55 - others can benefit from it again I'll
30:58 - play music and I will set a timer for
31:00 - about 2
31:20 - [Music]
31:26 - minutes
31:35 - [Music]
32:02 - [Music]
32:09 - [Music]
32:27 - [Music]
32:35 - [Music]
32:48 - about 30
32:50 - [Music]
32:56 - seconds
32:59 - [Music]
33:26 - okay thank you for working on that
33:29 - activity I hope it got you thinking
33:32 - about the different Avenues available to
33:34 - you for upskilling yourself and I hope
33:37 - you continue to do some research after
33:38 - this live
33:41 - stream let's move on to tip number four
33:45 - now it is time to lock in your elevator
33:48 - pitch or your personal
33:51 - brand I highly recommend about one to
33:54 - four sentences at the top of your resume
33:57 - and on your LinkedIn profile that
33:59 - summarize what you're all about so what
34:03 - can you uniquely offer an
34:05 - organization what are you interested in
34:08 - doing what have you
34:11 - accomplished how do other people
34:12 - describe you your uh personal BL brand
34:16 - or blurb it doesn't have to include
34:18 - everything on this list but it should
34:20 - include enough to quote sell yourself
34:23 - and you can also use this branding
34:24 - language in many situations like when
34:26 - you're Network working with people
34:28 - answering interview questions Etc so
34:30 - it's really handy to have a lot of
34:32 - clarity around what you have to offer
34:35 - because the reason we do this is because
34:37 - people hire people who have a strong
34:40 - sense of self and who know exactly who
34:43 - they are and what they offer the
34:45 - world and this step in the pivoting
34:48 - process can be very challenging so take
34:51 - time to mul it over you will likely go
34:54 - through many iterations until you are
34:56 - satisfied
34:58 - I also highly recommend asking friends
35:01 - and family and even some colleagues how
35:03 - they would Define your personal brand
35:06 - when I asked my boss this almost 10
35:08 - years ago she said my brand was high
35:11 - quality and I have been using this
35:13 - description in my cover letters ever
35:16 - since again if you are struggling to
35:18 - decide on your direction or identify
35:21 - your strengths and unique offerings I
35:23 - recommend working with a career coach
35:25 - and I'm happy to chat with
35:26 - you
35:29 - real quick here are my personal examples
35:32 - of how I went from defining my personal
35:34 - brand as a project manager to defining
35:37 - my personal brand as a Learning and
35:39 - Development professional so in 2019 my
35:43 - project management resume read as
35:46 - follows exceptionally detail oriented
35:49 - and organized professional with the
35:51 - ability to simultaneously manage
35:53 - multiple teams and projects to deliver
35:56 - measurable results analytical by Nature
35:59 - both numerically and linguistically yet
36:02 - friendly and team oriented seeking
36:04 - opportunities to leverage and build upon
36:06 - project management experience it's a de
36:09 - decent description but you'll probably
36:11 - agree with me that it's a little dry
36:14 - doesn't have a whole lot of personality
36:16 - so in 2021 when I was shifting into
36:19 - Learning and
36:20 - Development this is how my personal
36:23 - brand
36:25 - read I have always been an educator at
36:28 - heart as evidence by playing teacher at
36:31 - 3 years old with worm students in my
36:33 - backyard I'm a strong believer that the
36:36 - foundation of successful learning is
36:38 - clear communication and working as an
36:41 - interpreter and editor has helped me
36:43 - hone the skill my fondness for learning
36:45 - goes beyond developing effective and
36:48 - engaging content I Delight in conducting
36:50 - assessments and measuring impact too as
36:53 - a Perpetual learner myself I apply
36:56 - empathy to all that I
36:58 - do this one I believe gives the reader a
37:01 - much stronger idea of my personality
37:03 - what matters to me and what makes me
37:05 - very unique and I wasn't afraid to be a
37:08 - little silly too these are just two
37:10 - examples and there were many iterations
37:13 - between them and there have been many
37:15 - iterations since your goal here is to
37:18 - make yourself sound intriguing so that
37:20 - others want to learn more and my note
37:23 - here is enthusiasm is
37:26 - everything so time for our fourth
37:30 - activity now you're not going to have
37:32 - enough time to fully Define your brand
37:34 - in three minutes I took me hours to
37:36 - write mine so no pressure but I want you
37:39 - to start brainstorming what you could
37:41 - include in your brand blurb or your
37:44 - elevator pitch so jot down anything that
37:46 - comes to mind related to your
37:48 - professional interest areas your unique
37:51 - skills or experience or perspective that
37:54 - you offer the world or your
37:56 - accomplishments and result results and
37:58 - if you need help thinking of ways to
38:00 - describe yourself I'm going to share a
38:03 - link with fet so he can put it in the
38:06 - chat for me um let's see here getting
38:09 - the chat back for fet if you don't mind
38:12 - putting that in the chat that would be
38:13 - great um it is a link to 125 positive
38:18 - words and adjectives that a person can
38:19 - use to describe themselves so if it if
38:21 - you need some help getting those
38:23 - creative juices flowing feel free to
38:25 - reference this article but you have to
38:27 - no requirements there and again this is
38:30 - just the very beginning of your
38:31 - brainstorming of your brand do not
38:34 - expect to have written any sentences
38:35 - within three minutes just jot down ideas
38:38 - and words and again I'll play some music
38:41 - in set a timer for about three
38:56 - minutes
38:58 - [Music]
39:15 - [Music]
39:48 - [Music]
39:57 - [Music]
40:08 - [Music]
40:17 - [Music]
40:43 - [Music]
40:52 - [Music]
41:24 - [Music]
41:29 - about 30
41:31 - [Music]
41:45 - [Music]
41:53 - [Music]
41:56 - seconds
41:59 - [Music]
42:05 - okay welcome
42:07 - back uh after this live stream is over I
42:10 - encourage you to start drafting your
42:13 - unique personal brand and ask those
42:15 - close to you for
42:17 - feedback and this wraps up our four
42:20 - steps related to the preparation period
42:24 - of the pivoting process and next we will
42:27 - move on to what to do when you're ready
42:29 - to actually pivot so before we move on I
42:32 - can pause here and see if you have any
42:35 - questions for me on these first four
42:38 - tips feel free to type in the chat I'll
42:42 - also ask fet if have you seen any any
42:46 - questions come
42:48 - up throughout the webinar so
42:52 - far there were a few and hopefully the
42:56 - people that asked those questions can
42:58 - retype them in the chat it will be
43:00 - helpful we in case that everybody I feel
43:02 - like a couple of you in the chat were
43:04 - asking a similar questions so maybe we
43:06 - can just answer it all in one go instead
43:08 - of repeating ourselves so yeah if you
43:11 - guys could retype them in the chat that
43:13 - will be great that way we just don't
43:14 - have to repeat it in case that the same
43:18 - or similar question I see that somebody
43:20 - already ask in the chat of one
43:22 - question yes Danielle asked where are
43:25 - good places to include include your
43:27 - personal brand statement great question
43:31 - um I think it should be included
43:34 - anywhere that people are looking at you
43:36 - so your resume usually people have a
43:38 - little summary section at the top that
43:40 - is a perfect place for your personal
43:42 - brand if you have a LinkedIn profile or
43:44 - other professional social media profile
43:47 - there's usually an opportunity to have a
43:49 - little blurb about yourself if you have
43:51 - a portfolio or a website absolutely a
43:55 - great place to have on your great thing
43:56 - to on your homepage and then again I use
44:00 - it also to answer interview questions so
44:02 - like when I'm prepping for interviews
44:04 - they might ask me about um my background
44:07 - or what I uniquely offer or the really
44:10 - difficult question of describe yourself
44:11 - tell me about yourself great opportunity
44:14 - to use your personal brand as
44:17 - well and then we got another one from
44:20 - Kimberly I'd love to gain a feasible
44:22 - time frame for career switching as well
44:25 - as what as well as watch changes what
44:27 - changes need to appear on resumés and
44:30 - Linkedin profiles yeah really good
44:33 - questions um difficult to answer because
44:36 - I think it is a caseby casee basis as
44:39 - far as the time frame um I think what
44:42 - you'll realize as you go through these
44:43 - first four steps is you'll start to
44:45 - develop a better idea of your time frame
44:48 - so if you learn you can do some real
44:51 - loow hanging fruit easy lifts to boost
44:54 - your resume and then you are good to go
44:55 - to start applying and getting this next
44:57 - job awesome it might move a little bit
44:59 - quicker for you and it also just depends
45:02 - how hard you work how much of a priority
45:04 - this is and how quickly you go through
45:06 - the whole pivoting process that's really
45:08 - up to you but again working with a
45:10 - career coach could be really helpful and
45:12 - breaking it down into manageable small
45:15 - chunks at a time and developing an
45:17 - actual timeline and an actual game plan
45:19 - together but it will be on a case-by
45:22 - Case basis and your other question about
45:24 - yeah changes to your resume again
45:27 - um so for example remember I said I went
45:29 - from project management to instructional
45:31 - design um I had a lot of titles and jobs
45:35 - that weren't really instructional design
45:37 - related but when I realized I wanted to
45:39 - go into that field I made a lot of
45:40 - tweaks where I highlighted skills and
45:44 - experience that people in instructional
45:45 - design would be looking for and I didn't
45:48 - really highlight the ones that they
45:49 - don't really care about so there's a lot
45:51 - of aspects of project management that
45:53 - people in instructional design wouldn't
45:55 - really be looking for I didn't really
45:57 - include them and then things like
45:59 - training my own team leading projects
46:02 - independently um other skills that I
46:04 - knew were important as well as
46:06 - certifications and technical skills are
46:09 - what I highlighted so it's great to um
46:12 - tweak it based on your audience and
46:14 - based on what you're aiming for and
46:15 - that's where your brand blurb can be
46:17 - really handy too again highly recommend
46:20 - working with a career coach if you uh
46:23 - want help with that about how to
46:25 - basically brand your entire resume
46:28 - to the audience that you're aiming
46:31 - for more questions let's see how can one
46:34 - effectively address concerns about age
46:37 - when transitioning careers and competing
46:40 - with younger candidates for positions H
46:42 - Eva
46:43 - great great question um unfortunately
46:46 - there is some bias around age out there
46:49 - that uh we can't do a whole lot about as
46:52 - far as the way the world sees age but um
46:56 - I think I think age is such an asset and
46:59 - because basically it means experience so
47:00 - I think what I would recommend is
47:03 - focusing on your diverse experience your
47:06 - deep experience your um building up your
47:09 - resume as far as um how much how much
47:12 - you have to offer compared to those
47:14 - people who are fresh out of school or
47:16 - have only had one job or are touching
47:19 - tasks or projects for the very first
47:21 - time I think if your your brand perhaps
47:23 - could be highly experienced and you can
47:27 - kind of spin it in that way about being
47:29 - about why this is such a positive thing
47:32 - um I know that's a pretty high level
47:34 - answer we could talk about it more for
47:35 - sure if you wanted to book a free
47:37 - consultation about what exactly your
47:39 - background is but um and and kind of
47:42 - make a little bit more of a game plan
47:43 - there but great
47:46 - question how do you make up for the lack
47:48 - of experience required for a new
47:49 - position yeah Roman um that is I mean
47:54 - the knowledge piece and the skill piece
47:56 - and the experience piece they're all
47:57 - important gaps to fill the experience
48:00 - one can be really tricky sometimes
48:02 - because if you just for example if you
48:04 - haven't worked in Tech you haven't
48:06 - worked in Tech like that's just the
48:08 - situation at the moment I will get to in
48:11 - a couple more tips some examples of how
48:13 - you can still gain
48:15 - experience um even having not had a job
48:18 - in a particular field but um I think so
48:22 - we will get to that but focusing on your
48:25 - Knowledge and Skills and beefing those
48:27 - up as much as possible so you gain
48:29 - confidence you gain experience in that
48:32 - way and you can really speak to those
48:34 - skills will hopefully be enough plus a
48:37 - little bit of um some lowrisk
48:39 - experiments that you'll be learning
48:41 - about in just a minute so hold that
48:45 - question what was the biggest mindset
48:47 - adjustment that supported your journey
48:49 - in changing careers what a good question
48:53 - um that is a great
48:55 - question
48:57 - I'd say that
48:59 - I for me I have a couple ideas for me it
49:03 - is about not fearing failure or
49:08 - rejection knowing that this is going to
49:10 - involve as I mentioned earlier some grit
49:12 - and some
49:14 - scrappiness um so that was a big
49:16 - adjustment of being like you know what
49:18 - if this doesn't work I'm not going to
49:20 - die I'll be okay I'll still have a job
49:24 - I'll still be able to support my family
49:26 - like it's okay it's this is just
49:27 - something I'm going to try let's see
49:29 - what happens so that that was really
49:31 - helpful to me and I know that's much
49:33 - easier said than done but kind of just
49:36 - realizing life is short I want to try
49:38 - things that I want to try let's see
49:40 - let's see how it goes and if it doesn't
49:42 - go well I'll pivot to something else so
49:44 - kind of just having that confidence and
49:46 - trust in yourself that you'll figure it
49:48 - out and you'll be okay no matter what so
49:51 - I I know I can't just say think that way
49:54 - and then you'll be able to think that
49:55 - way but that's that was a really helpful
49:57 - mindset adjustment for me so recommend
50:01 - it um more questions what should I write
50:05 - in my brand statement if I have no
50:07 - experience in that field from Raphael
50:10 - yes um so that's that's totally okay if
50:14 - you have no experience in that field you
50:16 - you still have knowledge you still have
50:18 - skills you still have things to speak to
50:20 - you're still unique person with unique
50:23 - offerings I would just highlight those
50:25 - what is your perspective
50:28 - what do you care about what do you not
50:29 - care about basically like for example my
50:32 - um my brand blurb about Learning and
50:35 - Development talked about I care a lot
50:37 - about clear communication from my
50:39 - experience as an interpreter and I've
50:41 - also worked as an
50:42 - editor That's Unique a lot of people in
50:45 - Learning and Development might not care
50:48 - that much about communication but care
50:49 - about some other aspect of it but I
50:51 - highlighted that because that was a
50:53 - unique skill set that I had that does
50:55 - apply to this particular particular
50:56 - field that not many other people are
50:58 - talking about so it made me stand out as
51:00 - this is something I'm really good at
51:02 - it's really important to me it's part of
51:05 - the quality that I'm going to provide
51:06 - you if you hire
51:10 - me awesome thanks everybody great great
51:14 - questions I think I got through all of
51:16 - them and I think we can move on don't
51:18 - worry we're going to pause for questions
51:20 - again so feel free to keep thinking
51:21 - about them but great questions let's
51:25 - move on to the second half of our
51:28 - tips time for part two we are more than
51:31 - halfway there so to recap you have
51:35 - reflected on your goals you have
51:37 - identified your gaps you have started to
51:40 - upskill yourself and you've defined your
51:43 - personal brand and what you have to
51:45 - offer thanks to all of that preparation
51:48 - you are finally ready to make a move and
51:50 - actually pivot your
51:53 - career tip number five is everyone's
51:56 - favorite thing in the world
51:58 - networking I know the majority of people
52:01 - dread networking but it really truly
52:04 - does work and I'm going to explain why
52:08 - so according to the book designing your
52:10 - life by Bill Bernett and Dave
52:14 - Evans only about 5% of jobs are landed
52:18 - through the traditional model of sending
52:20 - resumés and cover letters through job
52:23 - applications
52:25 - 5% and as if that wasn't bad enough only
52:29 - about 20% of available jobs are even
52:32 - posted online that means 80% of the jobs
52:36 - that are out there are never posted
52:38 - anywhere where you can find them so what
52:41 - does all of this mean you have to
52:45 - network I know but believe me it is
52:48 - worth it so how do you find people to
52:50 - network with LinkedIn is an incredible
52:53 - resource for this and it is completely
52:55 - free there are other professional
52:58 - networking sites like handshake and many
53:00 - others out there that you are welcome to
53:02 - explore but let's just focus on LinkedIn
53:04 - today because it is probably the most
53:06 - wellknown
53:07 - so how do you find people first make
53:11 - sure that your LinkedIn profile is up
53:13 - toate and complete with your brand blurb
53:15 - and your resume and your photo and
53:17 - everything uh and then add everybody you
53:21 - know so connect with your childhood
53:24 - classmates and your professors and your
53:27 - former colleagues and your second
53:29 - cousins and your pickle ball Partners
53:32 - literally everyone as long as you don't
53:34 - have a bad relationship with them add
53:37 - them that is the point of LinkedIn it is
53:39 - all about building a
53:41 - network then search among your first
53:44 - connections to see if anyone is working
53:47 - in the field or the role that you are
53:49 - interested in if dozens of people fall
53:52 - into this category among your first
53:53 - connections then you are in great shape
53:57 - but if very few or none show up uh
54:00 - that's fine it just means it's time to
54:02 - consider some second level
54:04 - connections and you'll have to consider
54:06 - who among your first connections you
54:09 - feel comfortable enough asking for an
54:12 - introduction to a second level
54:14 - connection that you find that can be a
54:16 - really handy way to make a
54:18 - connection but now let's talk about how
54:20 - you actually Network when you found
54:23 - somebody that you want to network with
54:25 - whether you know them person Al or a
54:27 - mutual connection has introduced you to
54:29 - them it's time to ask for an
54:32 - informational
54:33 - interview informational interviews are
54:36 - low risk for both parties involved you
54:38 - are just asking to hear about their
54:41 - career path and current work and ask for
54:44 - some advice that's it and remember most
54:47 - people enjoy talking about themselves
54:49 - and most people enjoy giving advice uh
54:52 - so don't feel bad about asking for this
54:54 - but if they say no or if they don't
54:56 - respond do not take it personally you
54:58 - have lots and lots of options available
55:00 - to
55:02 - you so when you ask for your
55:04 - informational interview you can use part
55:06 - of your elevator pitch or your personal
55:09 - brand to introduce yourself and your
55:12 - goals you I I recommend you probably
55:14 - need to tweak it to make it sound a
55:15 - little less salesy like not something
55:17 - that would read from a resume but it's a
55:19 - great way to describe yourself and say
55:21 - hey this is who I am this is what I've
55:23 - been doing this is what I want to do
55:25 - this is what I have to offer
55:27 - so uh consider using it when introducing
55:29 - yourself or when talking to them
55:32 - live and then make sure uh oh sorry then
55:36 - ask uh 20 to 30 minutes of their time to
55:39 - hear about how they got into the field
55:41 - and what advice they might have for
55:44 - you and then make sure that you are
55:47 - prepared with a list of thoughtful
55:49 - questions to ask ahead of the interview
55:51 - so read their profile in advance to ask
55:54 - them personal questions about their own
55:56 - career your journey consider what
55:58 - aspects of their job you are most
56:00 - curious about and write down those
56:02 - questions ask them for advice on how to
56:05 - break into the field or what skills are
56:07 - most important Etc and remember you are
56:11 - running this meeting so have an agenda
56:14 - prepared have your questions written
56:16 - down take ownership of the conversation
56:19 - and don't go over time unless they say
56:21 - it's okay to go
56:23 - over and then if the conversation goes
56:26 - well well you can casually ask at the
56:28 - end if they know of any current openings
56:30 - that would be a good fit for you if they
56:32 - say no no problem you can just ask if
56:35 - there's anyone else they recommend you
56:37 - talk to and just like that you are
56:39 - networking
56:43 - again now it's time for our fifth
56:45 - activity if you have a LinkedIn account
56:48 - please log in and search for people that
56:50 - you'd like to network with in the field
56:52 - you're interested in and write down
56:55 - three names or three people that you'd
56:57 - like to talk to if you don't have
56:59 - LinkedIn I do highly recommend you get
57:00 - it but you don't have to do that right
57:02 - now uh you can search other social
57:04 - networking sites you have or even just
57:07 - pause and think about who in your life
57:08 - might be a good starting point to
57:10 - network with or who might be a good
57:12 - Mutual connection that can introduce you
57:14 - to
57:14 - somebody and write down three names as
57:17 - well I will play some music and give you
57:20 - about two or so
57:25 - minutes
57:28 - [Music]
57:37 - [Music]
58:57 - [Music]
59:12 - about 30
59:25 - seconds
59:38 - [Music]
59:52 - okay I love that someone wrote in the
59:54 - chat they wrote down 10 names that is
59:58 - fantastic uh I do recommend when you are
60:01 - ready to do your pivot to network with
60:04 - dozens and dozens of people to increase
60:07 - your potential opportunities and it will
60:10 - get easier every time you do it I
60:16 - promise okay while you are actively
60:19 - networking it's time to run some lowrisk
60:22 - experiments so this might speak to one
60:23 - of the questions that we got earlier
60:26 - this will help you build your skills
60:29 - boost your resume and confirm again that
60:31 - this is the right career for you so here
60:34 - are some examples of what a lowrisk
60:37 - experiment might look
60:39 - like you could ask for opportunities to
60:42 - use this skills that you're interested
60:44 - in in your current work so for example
60:48 - you could take on a small coding project
60:50 - if you want to learn to
60:52 - code you could test your skills on
60:55 - Friends and family by doing some work
60:57 - for them for free like building them a
61:02 - website you could offer your services
61:04 - through a contractor Marketplace and
61:06 - take on some small gigs to see how that
61:10 - goes you could start a book club among
61:14 - like-minded friends who want to discuss
61:16 - or even practice these skills or an
61:19 - Enterprise Resource Group at your place
61:21 - of work for those who are interested in
61:23 - discussing this particular subject
61:25 - matter
61:28 - you could participate in online
61:30 - community spaces and forums to help
61:33 - others by answering their questions or
61:35 - addressing their challenges such as
61:37 - community at Co
61:41 - Academy and you could volunteer in the
61:44 - space that you're interested
61:45 - in so the way I went about this when I
61:49 - was pivoting from project manager to
61:51 - Learning and Development was I found a
61:54 - part-time job sorry a part-time
61:57 - volunteer
61:58 - job uh as a learning and development
62:01 - manager at a startup company so I worked
62:04 - about 5 to 10 hours per week for free in
62:08 - addition to my full-time job and I
62:11 - developed Learning and Development
62:13 - content with a team of other volunteers
62:16 - this was an excellent way to test my
62:18 - skills and build my confidence and gain
62:21 - some leadership experience and
62:23 - experiment with my instructional design
62:26 - process via trial and error and a safe
62:29 - and lowrisk environment because I wasn't
62:31 - being paid and I added this role to my
62:34 - resume under my volunteering section and
62:37 - I'm certain that it helped me land my
62:39 - first instructional design job which I
62:41 - started just three months
62:45 - later it is time for our sixth activity
62:48 - I recommend that you go to
62:51 - volunteermatch.org and search a keyword
62:54 - based on the career that you'd like to
62:56 - Pivot into you will have to uh on the
62:59 - homepage click on find Opportunities
63:02 - there's a button at the top and then
63:04 - that will bring you to a page where you
63:05 - can filter through keywords or uh by
63:09 - virtual or in person or by skills or
63:12 - causes that you care about but you have
63:14 - to like you have to click that button
63:15 - first to get to that filter
63:17 - page so this website is how I found my
63:20 - Learning and Development volunteer role
63:22 - you'd be surprised how many business
63:24 - related volunteer jobs there are and I
63:27 - ask that you do a little search note
63:29 - anything that pops up that might
63:31 - interest you in your activities document
63:34 - I'll play some music and give you about
63:36 - two
63:50 - [Music]
63:54 - minutes
64:16 - [Music]
64:24 - [Music]
64:52 - [Music]
65:40 - about 30
65:44 - [Music]
65:54 - seconds
65:57 - [Music]
66:16 - okay welcome back again after this live
66:20 - stream is over I recommend continuing to
66:23 - search for volunteer opportunities if
66:25 - this is a low-risk experiment that
66:27 - interests you if not definitely explore
66:30 - some of the other ideas that I
66:34 - shared and now for our final tip it is
66:38 - time to plan your route as in my own
66:42 - career Journey uh pivots often don't
66:45 - happen overnight or in one simple step
66:48 - you might remember that I pivoted from a
66:51 - project manager at a real estate firm to
66:54 - a project manager at an educational
66:56 - company to an instructional designer for
66:58 - the federal government to an
67:00 - instructional designer at a private
67:01 - company and each of these jobs were
67:04 - strategic Stepping Stones to eventually
67:07 - land my ideal job the famous career
67:11 - advice book called what color is Your
67:13 - Parachute by Richard n BS outlines the
67:16 - three different ways that you can pivot
67:18 - your career and I thought it was an
67:20 - excellent way to describe this so I am
67:22 - going to provide the example that is in
67:25 - the book
67:26 - so in this example you are currently an
67:29 - accountant in the television industry
67:32 - but you want to be a reporter in
67:34 - medicine or in healthcare the most
67:37 - difficult path would be to Pivot in one
67:39 - step and change both your job title and
67:42 - your industry at the same time it can be
67:45 - done but the chances of success are much
67:48 - lower and it's a pretty big uphill
67:50 - battle so the easier way is to break
67:53 - down your pivot into two steps you can
67:56 - either pivot your title first while
67:58 - staying in the same industry or pivot
68:00 - your industry first while keeping the
68:02 - same title so as you can see on this
68:04 - diagram if you go from a to c you change
68:08 - your title from accountant to reporter
68:09 - while staying in the television industry
68:12 - or if you go from A to B you keep
68:14 - working as an accountant but you switch
68:15 - from television to medicine and then
68:18 - after you work in that space for a
68:19 - little while you build up your
68:21 - experience you build up your resume
68:23 - you're ready to make that final pivot
68:24 - over to D as a reporter in
68:27 - medicine and the route that you take can
68:30 - and will be unique to you and your
68:32 - current situation but it's important to
68:35 - plan your route in advance while also
68:37 - leaving room for flexibility if things
68:39 - change or opportunities
68:42 - arise so time for our seventh activity
68:46 - let's take two minutes to write down a
68:48 - few different roots that you could take
68:50 - to Pivot your career so what would it
68:52 - look like if you changed your title
68:54 - first or if you changed your industry
68:57 - first or what would be a good first job
69:00 - to aim for or what other possible routes
69:03 - could you take there are no wrong
69:05 - answers here this is just a
69:06 - brainstorming activity to get you
69:08 - thinking about the different creative
69:10 - approaches you could take I'll give you
69:12 - about two minutes while I play some
69:24 - music

71:43 - continue to work on your strategy for
71:46 - getting from your current job to your
71:48 - ideal job and consider different routes
71:50 - that you can
71:51 - take this marks the end of our seven
71:54 - tips
71:56 - I think I'm just going to power through
71:57 - and wrap up with our uh final activity
72:01 - and then we will have plenty of time for
72:03 - Q&A at the
72:06 - end okay my friends we've made it
72:08 - through our seven tips let's quickly
72:10 - recap them and then I will I'd like to
72:14 - wrap up with some goal settings so that
72:16 - all your hard work today doesn't go to
72:19 - waste I knew I know I just threw a lot
72:22 - out at you so let's recap what these
72:24 - seven tis
72:26 - are while you are preparing to Pivot
72:29 - first reflect reflect on your goals your
72:32 - priorities what matters to you why
72:35 - you're even doing
72:37 - this identify your knowledge gaps your
72:40 - skill gaps and your experience
72:43 - gaps work on upskilling yourself through
72:47 - lowcost or free
72:49 - options and Define your personal brand
72:52 - and what you have to offer the worlds

73:16 - job it's finally time for our very last
73:20 - activity reflect on your notes from all
73:23 - of the activities that we did today and
73:25 - then set one achievable goal for
73:27 - yourself that you will complete this
73:29 - week that will move you one step closer
73:32 - to pivoting your career so for example
73:35 - maybe your goal is to read 10 job
73:38 - postings that interest you and jot down
73:41 - your knowledge and skill gaps or maybe
73:44 - update your LinkedIn profile and connect
73:46 - with everyone you know or maybe register
73:49 - for the code academy course that you've
73:51 - had your eye on for a while those are
73:54 - just some examples but take about two
73:56 - minutes and set a goal for
74:10 - [Music]
74:24 - yourself
74:25 - [Music]
74:31 - [Music]
74:48 - [Music]
74:58 - [Music]
75:05 - [Music]
75:31 - about 30
75:45 - [Music]

76:20 - okay thank you so much for doing those
76:22 - eight
76:23 - activities uh I hope that this last one
76:27 - gives you an idea of what it feels like
76:28 - to break down your pivot into small and
76:31 - manageable
76:32 - goals um so that you can be successful
76:36 - it's uh it's very it's very helpful to
76:39 - chunk things down set a goal for
76:41 - yourself a week or whatever time frame
76:44 - works for you so that you don't get
76:49 - overwhelmed I want to thank you all for

76:57 - chat you've accomplished a lot during
77:00 - our short time together so I hope you
77:02 - feel very proud of yourselves if you
77:04 - want to dive into these Concepts even
77:06 - deeper with a career coach please

77:33 - you all for joining me today and now I
77:36 - will pass it back over to fet to see if
77:38 - you all have questions that I can answer
77:41 - for
77:43 - you fantastic I definitely know that I
77:45 - learned something new today so I hope
77:47 - that the audience did too um always
77:50 - great to see people in the chat asking
77:52 - questions actually I saw a question
77:54 - question from way earlier when we
77:57 - started the live stream uh Kaye was
78:01 - actually curious to know what got you
78:03 - into being a sign language
78:06 - interpreter oh very interesting question
78:09 - um so actually my grandmother was deaf
78:13 - she became deaf later in life like in in
78:16 - her mid-40s very suddenly so she
78:20 - actually never learned sign language but
78:22 - she was my exposure to a deaf person for
78:24 - for the very first time and she
78:27 - encouraged my interest in Sign Language
78:29 - I was curious about the death Community
78:31 - I was curious about the language so she
78:33 - would buy me books and videos on sign
78:35 - language I also think the language just
78:38 - spoke to me in a unique way because of I
78:42 - was a quiet kid I lik the idea of
78:44 - expressing myself in a quiet way I also
78:48 - was a dancer and I felt like expressing
78:50 - myself through movement made so much
78:51 - more sense to me so I was really drawn
78:53 - to it for many different reasons and I
78:56 - dabbled in it as I got older and finally
78:58 - when I graduated from college I said you
79:01 - know what I really want to try this I
79:02 - want to see if this is something I could
79:04 - do so it was really I'm so grateful for
79:07 - that time even though I'm not currently
79:08 - pursuing it it's so cool to have learned
79:10 - that language I guess in a way it's
79:13 - almost like you pivoted into another
79:15 - language so maybe your first ever pivot
79:19 - that's a good point I'm sure we've all
79:20 - been pivoting since a very young age
79:22 - without even realizing it
79:25 - I see that Kimberly has a question for
79:27 - you in the chat okay Kimberly let's see
79:29 - how important is physical relocation
79:32 - when switching a career especially when
79:34 - that field has a geographical hub for
79:36 - example Silicon Valley oh good question
79:40 - um you know again I think that is a
79:41 - case-by case basis there are so many
79:45 - jobs these days especially in Tech that
79:47 - you can do online you I think since Co
79:50 - hit we all have really adapted to doing
79:53 - things virtually I personally think most
79:56 - jobs can be done virtually um but it
79:58 - depends on the employer right it depends
80:00 - on what matters to them it depends on
80:03 - what kind of opportunities they provide
80:04 - remotely so there's a few different ways
80:06 - you could go about this if if it does
80:08 - not interest you at all to relocate then
80:10 - that's totally fine that's a boundary
80:12 - you set for yourself you only look for
80:14 - remote work or work exactly where you
80:16 - are located if you're open to it maybe
80:19 - do a little bit of research first to see
80:21 - what kinds of companies or organizations
80:24 - in that particular ular geographical
80:25 - location interest you what would it take
80:28 - to get those jobs see what kinds of
80:30 - opportunities would be available to you
80:32 - before actually making that move so that
80:34 - it isn't done in vain um and again I
80:37 - think working with a career coach on the
80:39 - pros and cons and kind of just digging
80:40 - deeper into the root reasoning for this
80:44 - move or not for this move would be
80:46 - really helpful so I I recommend talking
80:47 - it through with a coach or with a a
80:49 - close person in your
80:52 - life great and while while we wait for
80:55 - other people to drop their questions I
80:57 - actually have one myself and it's
81:00 - related to the seven steps and you know
81:03 - we talked about reflecting and
81:05 - visualizing the journey what you're
81:06 - going to have to do next um how one of
81:10 - the problems that we run a lot into in
81:12 - our community spaces here for people
81:14 - trying to Pivot into Tech is that NE
81:18 - that sense that never goes away of
81:19 - impostor syndrome of I'm not good enough
81:23 - I don't have the correct background
81:25 - I don't have the correct like experience
81:27 - like I'm not going to be taken seriously
81:29 - so when you're working through this and
81:32 - you're trying to put it all together so
81:34 - you can have a successful career pivot
81:37 - uh do you have any tips on how to
81:39 - overcome that dread feeling of imposter
81:42 - syndrome and not maybe feeling like you
81:44 - don't belong where you're trying to
81:47 - go what a great question um there's so
81:50 - much we could talk about around impostor
81:52 - syndrome it's play so many people these
81:56 - days it's a real thing uh first I will
81:59 - say you have so many skills so much
82:03 - knowledge and so much experience whether
82:06 - or not you have ever worked in this
82:08 - particular role or this particular
82:09 - industry so you need to remind yourself
82:11 - of that you have so much to offer you're
82:14 - already a very talented person it's just
82:17 - about channeling your past experience
82:19 - and those talents in the right direction
82:22 - in the direction that you're aiming for
82:24 - so be kind to yourself and remember that
82:27 - you have so much to offer uh there are
82:30 - as far as individual tips because of
82:32 - course easier said than done to just
82:33 - remember this about yourself um working
82:36 - with a coach or someone else close to
82:39 - you as far as actually doing some
82:41 - activities like brainstorming and
82:43 - writing down all the different skills
82:45 - you have to offer let's see how long
82:47 - that list can get writing down those
82:49 - transferable skills you can do lots of
82:51 - different um games and activities and
82:55 - and just brainstorming sessions with
82:57 - somebody like a career coach that can
82:59 - help you reframe your thinking reset
83:02 - your mindset um also you can dig a
83:04 - little bit deeper into like truly what's
83:07 - causing this impostor syndrome so I do
83:10 - recommend talking to people that you
83:12 - feel comfortable talking to digging into
83:15 - what's really causing it to identify the
83:17 - root problem but all that to say you
83:22 - have no reason to have impostor syndrome
83:24 - I promise you you are totally capable
83:26 - and you can make this move in just a few
83:29 - months if that's what you want to do you
83:31 - are ready you are capable and you can
83:33 - you can uh Take On The
83:35 - World we are ready wow thank you for the
83:39 - inspiration I see that we have one more
83:41 - question coming from Mr
83:43 - gichi okay do you have any advice in
83:46 - terms of competing against people with
83:48 - collegeuniversity degrees versus being
83:51 - self-taught
83:52 - oo that's a good one um um let's see so
83:56 - I mean I'm I'm a great example of that
83:58 - actually instructional design is a
84:01 - degree you can get a bachelor's or a
84:04 - master's possibly even a PhD in
84:07 - instructional design I do not have any
84:09 - of those but I have other degrees I have
84:11 - other pieces of experience that I
84:13 - highlighted I find that it will be
84:17 - employer dependent some employers for
84:19 - whatever reason care so much about
84:22 - academics not a whole lot you can do
84:23 - there if is a priority for them but I'd
84:25 - say most these days are being more
84:28 - flexible about it um for me I just
84:31 - beefed up my resume in a way that made
84:33 - me look really experienced I I happen to
84:36 - have a master's degree it's not an
84:38 - instructional design but it never hurts
84:39 - to just have something right um and I
84:42 - think I I was all I had everything that
84:44 - was needed to be considered um if you
84:47 - are in a particular industry where the
84:50 - college or university degree is huge is
84:52 - highly important I think maybe getting
84:54 - some certifications something like not
84:57 - as Grand a scale as going back to school
84:59 - for multiple years but maybe spending a
85:03 - couple thousand dollars on some
85:05 - certifications or online courses so you
85:07 - can show you are academically trained in
85:09 - this space and then again it's all about
85:12 - the way you design your resume your
85:15 - profile the way that you brand yourself
85:18 - and I'd be happy to chat with you in a a
85:20 - free online consultation if you want to
85:23 - talk more about uh what your challenges
85:26 - are fantastic all right I don't see any
85:29 - other I don't see any other questions in
85:31 - the chat so I guess I'll just go ahead
85:32 - and ask a bonus question for me and that
85:35 - is um when thinking about pivoting
85:37 - careers I've heard of some recruiters
85:40 - that say that there's a really fine line
85:43 - between being exploratory and interested
85:46 - in a field and coming across not coming
85:50 - across unattached or not serious enough
85:53 - where sometimes recruiter will say well
85:55 - you know if we are hiring somebody that
85:57 - is in a jior role maybe you're coming
85:59 - with no experience but they're still
86:00 - willing to take a chance on you based on
86:03 - your past experience or things that are
86:04 - related to the role um they still want
86:07 - to hire somebody that seems to be
86:10 - serious I guess about that role in that
86:12 - career so do you think that there is
86:16 - something to it about uh identifying
86:19 - yourself as a pivot pivot I guess or
86:22 - saying yeah I worked in a different
86:23 - field but now this is what I want to do
86:25 - and how you communicate that that
86:27 - doesn't mean that you're not has fully
86:30 - committed to that field as somebody that
86:31 - has more experience or that has done it
86:33 - in the
86:35 - past yeah yeah um I think you pretty
86:38 - much answered your question there I
86:39 - think it's all about the way that you
86:41 - communicate your your past your present
86:44 - and your future goals so I think it's
86:48 - always a good idea to be transparent
86:51 - meaning saying you know what I was sign
86:53 - language interpreter for seven years
86:55 - it's kind of funny to think about that
86:56 - now it's not related to what I do I did
86:59 - it for these reasons I learned so many
87:01 - things from this but I also learned it
87:03 - wasn't the right fit for me and during
87:05 - that time I did some real
87:07 - self-exploration and discovered that i'
87:10 - much rather be doing this and I think
87:12 - just being able to tell your story makes
87:14 - you interesting makes you trustworthy
87:17 - because you're willing to share I don't
87:19 - think it should in my opinion harm your
87:21 - chances at all I think it makes you
87:23 - human and I think a lot of people these
87:25 - days appreciate diverse backgrounds some
87:28 - people are in the same field for 20 30
87:30 - 40 years that's fine they're obviously
87:33 - incredible at what they do but I also
87:35 - think we have we put a lot of um weight
87:38 - and praise around people who tried a lot
87:40 - of things had a lot of life experience
87:43 - so I don't think it should hurt you I
87:44 - think it just comes down to being able
87:46 - to tell that story in a way that makes
87:49 - it sound like it actually helped you it
87:52 - helped build your character build your
87:54 - knowledge and experience and it's only a
87:55 - benefit to your future
88:02 - career okay so with that I reposted all

all right a little bit about me to kick things off I am mateline am Kio I currently work in Learning and Development and as a career coach I specialize in helping new grads young professionals and career pivoter like yourselves uh as fed said I have pivoted my own career three times more on that later I live on the beautiful coast of Southern Maine my husband and I recently bought a house and we joke that half the reason we bought this house was for our dog to have a house so you could say that I am a dog Enthusiast feel free to check out my about page on my website for a photo of my pup okay so let's dive into our main topic for the day so what is pivoting no it is not this and hopefully not as stressful as this for those who don't know this is one of the most iconic scenes in the TV show Friends one of my favorites but in all seriousness here is how author and career strategist Jenny Blake defines it in her book titled pivot a career pivot means doubling down on what is working to make a purposeful shift in a new related Direction pivoting is intent is an intentional and methodical process for nimbly navigating career changes so pivoting means changing careers but it could be a small pivot like from copywriter to copy editor or a really big pivot like from high school history teacher to data scientist in both cases the pivoter learns to leverage their current skills and knowledge build new skills and knowledge and take purposeful steps towards their career goal and it is true that some jobs require a specific degree where you have to go back to school to make a career change for example a lot of healthc care professions but many many don't in particular the tech industry and we're going to focus on those jobs today so let me tell you about my pivoting story to set the stage a little bit after earning money my bachelor's in psychology which I really enjoyed studying I had a great job at the American Psychological Association in Washington DC so naturally I did what any sane person would do I went back to school for two years to study sign language interpreting I was in this field for seven years and after graduating from my interpreting program I worked as a project manager at a local University sign language department and I did freelance interpreting as a side gig as well I also earned my MBA while working at this University and over the years I realized that I was interested in the language but not much else related to this particular profession it was the wrong fit because I only focused on my interest in the subject matter and not all the aspects that made up this career I realized at that time that other than interpreting the only other major skill on my resume was project management for my time at the University so after I left my current job I became surprise surprise a project manager basically by default which is also not a great way to make a career decision but as a super organized type a person I thought this would be a great fit for me and I was good at it but again over time I realized that while I liked the organizational aspect of the job it didn't allow for much Freedom or creativity which I came to learn are things that are important to me so at that time I reflected on my time working at the University and I realized that what I enjoyed most was the educational content that we were building I loved working with adult Learners helping them improve their skills and this led to a much more strategic career move into instructional design or the broader field of Learning and Development this this was the first time that I thoughtfully planned my Pivot from one career to the next and it worked in my current project management role at a real estate company I asked for opportunities to develop internal training for my team and then I actually got laid off when covid hit but that was okay because I knew where I wanted to Pivot to next I then got a job as a project manager at an educational company one step closer to being in the field of Learning and Development and again I asked for opportunities to build and run internal team training I also spent time on the side earning instructional design certifications networking with others in the field and even volunteering as a learning and development manager to beef up my resume I finally landed my first job as an instructional designer for the federal government and I knew that the bureaucratic environment would not be a great fit for me long term but I took the job as an opportunity to gain instructional design experience before landing The Learning and Development job that I'm in today and then my current job along with my years of experience as a mentor exposed me to the world of coaching and it was the first time I felt like I found something that truly combined everything I was interested in and everything I was good at Psychology helping others adult education business being super organized creativity Etc I knew that my varied background plus my personal experience pivoting careers three times would be valuable to others at the beginning of their career journey and thus launched my career coaching career as you can see my career path has not been straightforward and that is okay over the years New Roads have presented themselves to me and if I were not openminded to them I would not be where I am today so I learned all the tips and tricks that I'm going to share with you today during my Pivot from project manager to instructional designer so I will focus on this particular part of my journey as I walk through each tip so before we dive into my seven tips I'm going to pause real quick and see if you have any questions so far I'll ask fed if any questions have come up in the chat that we should address at this time love the friends pivoting reference very nice Jonathan all right seems like we're good to move on it is time to talk through my seven tips in a minute I will share a Google doc with you all um with all of the activities that you're going to be doing today and you can make a copy of the document and write out your answers as we go I promise that these activities will be useful to you so I really do hope you participate in them these tips will be broken up into two parts the first part is the preparation you do before you are ready to Pivot and the second part is when you are ready to make that pivot happen let's start with preparation the first tip is to take a minute to pause and reflect this might seem trivial but it is vital to developing a Clear Vision and Direction you might already know exactly what career you want to Pivot into but do you know why this career path interests you pivoting takes time and effort so it's important to be intentional and methodical about exactly what you are aiming for as Jenny Blake described in that previous quote so ask s why am I interested in pivoting careers what problem are you trying to solve or what Vision are you trying to manifest for yourself what does a successful career look like to me what are you aiming for or how how will you know when you've gotten there what do I fear or what is holding me back career moves are scary and it's totally normal to be anxious about it it's important to understand your fears so that you can face them headon and they don't get the best of you and what am I willing to sacrifice to make this pivot happen when you say yes to something you are saying no to basically everything else so what are you willing to do and what are you not willing to do to land this new career when I realize that project management wasn't for me I reflected on all the other aspects of my job that I enjoyed I reflected on what was missing that I needed what I was good at Etc and uh this deep reflection helped me recognize that instructional design was a better fit for me I'd also like to add that if you have no idea what you want to do next you can watch another webinar that I've done that is called passion is overrated which I will drop in the chat now um you are also welcome as I said before to book a free career coaching consult a with me I will put both of these in the chat now sorry if they got a little bit funky looking okay cool before we start our first activity I will put the activity sheet in the chat for you all to open and to make a copy this is a Google doc that you should be able to open and make a copy of so you're welcome to make a copy by either going to file make a copy or file download and download as Microsoft Word and then once you make a copy you will be able to edit it and add all your answers for each activity the one thing that I ask is that you don't read ahead and start working on activities before we get to them you will get a lot more out of this training if you stay in the present moment and after the webinar is over this document is yours to keep so don't feel rushed to complete everything today you can always go back to it m sorry for interrupting for a second uh it seems like maybe YouTube chat is moderating your links or something they weren't going through so if you pass them to me I'll be happy to paste them in the chat sure will do thank you for all the chats that you were trying to share yeah all of them that's just I'll yeah pass them to me and I'll post them okay so I just gave you the activity sheet and then here is the webinar on passion is overrated and here is the free consultation link I think that's everything thank you for catching that sorry about that everybody okay all right so like I said feel free to make a copy um please don't read ahead but uh uh we're going to get to everything so don't worry about it also if you um are having having trouble with the document or you just don't want to use it that's totally fine you are not required to use it you're welcome to just open a blank Google doc a blank word doc a blank email for yourself whatever you'd like to use um to type up your answers for each activity um it is the the activity sheet is helpful because it includes instructions for each activity but I will also display those on the screen so not a requirement that you use it hopefully that worked for you all so let's start our very first activity okay let's take about 3 minutes to answer these reflection questions that I just shared why am I interested in pivoting careers what does a successful career look like to me what am I afraid of what am I willing to sacrifice or not sacrifice I realize that these are loaded questions so just write down a few words for each the first thing that comes to your mind you are always welcome to revisit these activities after our live stream is over my goal is to just give you a taste of each tip and each step in the pivoting process so that you have the tools you need to continue working on your pivot after this training is over so I will play some music and set a timer for 3 minutes and I'll let you know when that timer is up about 30 seconds okay welcome back I'm sure that went by very fast but that's okay I'm sure there's a lot more you could write and you are welcome to continue working on this after the live stream is over and your career Journey should include regular checkins with yourself to make sure you are on the right path so I highly encourage lots of reflection let's move on to tip number two the next tip is to do your research to identify your knowledge skill and experience gaps this is a big step in the pivoting process so basically research what it takes to succeed in the role that you're interested in the way I went about this when I was looking to Pivot from project management to instructional design was I read lots of job descriptions and noted which knowledge skill and experience gaps I did have and I did not have I researched different Industries sectors and even individual organizations to narrow down what environment I was aiming for I read tons of Articles and blogs and books I watched lots of YouTube videos I listened to podcasts related to my future career and collected as much information as I could and of course I talked to people I conducted a lot of informational interviews which we will talk about in a little bit and I took all of this and I took a bunch of notes to to just gather everything I learned from this research and the goal of this step is really it's twofold the first part is to solidify your direction this is a gut check to make sure that this pivot is actually a smart and viable move and that it still interests you right now which you might learn after your research that it doesn't or something else does and then of course it's also to identify your knowledge skill and experience gaps so then you can work on filling them all right it's already time for our second activity since we don't have time right now to conduct indepth research we're going to instead focus on the gaps we already know that we have so take about two minutes and write down any knowledge gaps skill gaps or experience gaps that you that you currently have right now and that you know you'll need to fill before pivoting your career so for example if you want to become a coder uh a knowledge Gap might be you don't understand the many different ways that engineers and web developers collaborate or a skill Gap might be you have not learned python or an experience Gap might be that you've never worked in the tech industry before so those are all just some examples to get you thinking again I'm going to play some music and set a timer for about 2 minutes n about 30 seconds okay thank you for doing that activity as with all of these activities I welcome you to go back and revisit this after the live stream is over and I highly encourage you to do lots and lots of research so you're well informed about your career pivot but hopefully this activity gave you a good starting point of what gaps you might need to fill before you attempt to Pivot your career so if you are one of the lucky ones and you learned in our last step that you have zero knowledge skill or experience gaps then you are welcome to skip step number three but for the vast majority of us the next step is to upskill ourselves and upskilling means improving your knowledge or your skills or your experience so that you can become a desirable candidate for the position that you're interested in and now that you've identified the major gaps you need to fill it is time to start filling them but luckily there are many free or lowcost options to do this for example books podcasts videos webinars or conferences or events courses and certifications Community groups or mentorship opportunities or code academy I'll let Fede drop some code academy resources in the chat if he'd like and I'd like to point out I'm not listing degree programs I'm not mentioning going back to school there are many lowcost and selfstudy options available to you that you can start using today and it's up to you how much money you're willing to spend to advance your career but my advice is to weigh the cost of the professional development activity against its benefits that it might provide in landing a new career a better salary improve work life balance Etc so personally I paid for two online certification courses in instructional design which greatly improved my Knowledge and Skills and gave my resume a boost other than that I completed the rest of my upskilling through only the cost of a couple books so for example one of the technical skills that I knew I had to learn was how to use a software called articulate storyline which is an e learning development software for people who are in instructional design I wasn't able to download a free trial since it wouldn't run on a Mac but I do highly recommend free software trials as a great upscaling option so what I did is I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to use this particular software until I developed a solid understanding of it and after that I felt confident enough in my ability to master my storylines skills when finally able to get my hands on the software so that I added it to my resume as something I am quote familiar with uh so for this you have to be a good judge of your own abilities and your own capabilities but again ex I I highly recommend gaining exposure to something and then expressing familiarity with it as a great way to give your resume a boost to answer interview questions Etc I'd also like to note that upskilling requires a lot of intrinsic motivation scrappiness and grit if you are a serious if you are serious about changing your career then you need to become a serious student of that particular career and teach yourself what you need to know if this is something that you struggle with consider finding a study buddy that you meet with regularly to hold each other accountable or even better I recommend working with a career coach time for our third activity let's take about two minutes to search for some resources that might help you upskill yourself so for example you could Google videos on how engineers and web developers collaborate or python online courses uh and then note in your document a few resources that catch your eye and that you'd like to explore more after this live stream is over and if you'd like feel free to share one of those resources in the chat so that others can benefit from it again I'll play music and I will set a timer for about 2 minutes about 30 seconds okay thank you for working on that activity I hope it got you thinking about the different Avenues available to you for upskilling yourself and I hope you continue to do some research after this live stream let's move on to tip number four now it is time to lock in your elevator pitch or your personal brand I highly recommend about one to four sentences at the top of your resume and on your LinkedIn profile that summarize what you're all about so what can you uniquely offer an organization what are you interested in doing what have you accomplished how do other people describe you your uh personal BL brand or blurb it doesn't have to include everything on this list but it should include enough to quote sell yourself and you can also use this branding language in many situations like when you're Network working with people answering interview questions Etc so it's really handy to have a lot of clarity around what you have to offer because the reason we do this is because people hire people who have a strong sense of self and who know exactly who they are and what they offer the world and this step in the pivoting process can be very challenging so take time to mul it over you will likely go through many iterations until you are satisfied I also highly recommend asking friends and family and even some colleagues how they would Define your personal brand when I asked my boss this almost 10 years ago she said my brand was high quality and I have been using this description in my cover letters ever since again if you are struggling to decide on your direction or identify your strengths and unique offerings I recommend working with a career coach and I'm happy to chat with you real quick here are my personal examples of how I went from defining my personal brand as a project manager to defining my personal brand as a Learning and Development professional so in 2019 my project management resume read as follows exceptionally detail oriented and organized professional with the ability to simultaneously manage multiple teams and projects to deliver measurable results analytical by Nature both numerically and linguistically yet friendly and team oriented seeking opportunities to leverage and build upon project management experience it's a de decent description but you'll probably agree with me that it's a little dry doesn't have a whole lot of personality so in 2021 when I was shifting into Learning and Development this is how my personal brand read I have always been an educator at heart as evidence by playing teacher at 3 years old with worm students in my backyard I'm a strong believer that the foundation of successful learning is clear communication and working as an interpreter and editor has helped me hone the skill my fondness for learning goes beyond developing effective and engaging content I Delight in conducting assessments and measuring impact too as a Perpetual learner myself I apply empathy to all that I do this one I believe gives the reader a much stronger idea of my personality what matters to me and what makes me very unique and I wasn't afraid to be a little silly too these are just two examples and there were many iterations between them and there have been many iterations since your goal here is to make yourself sound intriguing so that others want to learn more and my note here is enthusiasm is everything so time for our fourth activity now you're not going to have enough time to fully Define your brand in three minutes I took me hours to write mine so no pressure but I want you to start brainstorming what you could include in your brand blurb or your elevator pitch so jot down anything that comes to mind related to your professional interest areas your unique skills or experience or perspective that you offer the world or your accomplishments and result results and if you need help thinking of ways to describe yourself I'm going to share a link with fet so he can put it in the chat for me um let's see here getting the chat back for fet if you don't mind putting that in the chat that would be great um it is a link to 125 positive words and adjectives that a person can use to describe themselves so if it if you need some help getting those creative juices flowing feel free to reference this article but you have to no requirements there and again this is just the very beginning of your brainstorming of your brand do not expect to have written any sentences within three minutes just jot down ideas and words and again I'll play some music in set a timer for about three minutes about 30 seconds okay welcome back uh after this live stream is over I encourage you to start drafting your unique personal brand and ask those close to you for feedback and this wraps up our four steps related to the preparation period of the pivoting process and next we will move on to what to do when you're ready to actually pivot so before we move on I can pause here and see if you have any questions for me on these first four tips feel free to type in the chat I'll also ask fet if have you seen any any questions come up throughout the webinar so far there were a few and hopefully the people that asked those questions can retype them in the chat it will be helpful we in case that everybody I feel like a couple of you in the chat were asking a similar questions so maybe we can just answer it all in one go instead of repeating ourselves so yeah if you guys could retype them in the chat that will be great that way we just don't have to repeat it in case that the same or similar question I see that somebody already ask in the chat of one question yes Danielle asked where are good places to include include your personal brand statement great question um I think it should be included anywhere that people are looking at you so your resume usually people have a little summary section at the top that is a perfect place for your personal brand if you have a LinkedIn profile or other professional social media profile there's usually an opportunity to have a little blurb about yourself if you have a portfolio or a website absolutely a great place to have on your great thing to on your homepage and then again I use it also to answer interview questions so like when I'm prepping for interviews they might ask me about um my background or what I uniquely offer or the really difficult question of describe yourself tell me about yourself great opportunity to use your personal brand as well and then we got another one from Kimberly I'd love to gain a feasible time frame for career switching as well as what as well as watch changes what changes need to appear on resumés and Linkedin profiles yeah really good questions um difficult to answer because I think it is a caseby casee basis as far as the time frame um I think what you'll realize as you go through these first four steps is you'll start to develop a better idea of your time frame so if you learn you can do some real loow hanging fruit easy lifts to boost your resume and then you are good to go to start applying and getting this next job awesome it might move a little bit quicker for you and it also just depends how hard you work how much of a priority this is and how quickly you go through the whole pivoting process that's really up to you but again working with a career coach could be really helpful and breaking it down into manageable small chunks at a time and developing an actual timeline and an actual game plan together but it will be on a caseby Case basis and your other question about yeah changes to your resume again um so for example remember I said I went from project management to instructional design um I had a lot of titles and jobs that weren't really instructional design related but when I realized I wanted to go into that field I made a lot of tweaks where I highlighted skills and experience that people in instructional design would be looking for and I didn't really highlight the ones that they don't really care about so there's a lot of aspects of project management that people in instructional design wouldn't really be looking for I didn't really include them and then things like training my own team leading projects independently um other skills that I knew were important as well as certifications and technical skills are what I highlighted so it's great to um tweak it based on your audience and based on what you're aiming for and that's where your brand blurb can be really handy too again highly recommend working with a career coach if you uh want help with that about how to basically brand your entire resume to the audience that you're aiming for more questions let's see how can one effectively address concerns about age when transitioning careers and competing with younger candidates for positions H Eva great great question um unfortunately there is some bias around age out there that uh we can't do a whole lot about as far as the way the world sees age but um I think I think age is such an asset and because basically it means experience so I think what I would recommend is focusing on your diverse experience your deep experience your um building up your resume as far as um how much how much you have to offer compared to those people who are fresh out of school or have only had one job or are touching tasks or projects for the very first time I think if your your brand perhaps could be highly experienced and you can kind of spin it in that way about being about why this is such a positive thing um I know that's a pretty high level answer we could talk about it more for sure if you wanted to book a free consultation about what exactly your background is but um and and kind of make a little bit more of a game plan there but great question how do you make up for the lack of experience required for a new position yeah Roman um that is I mean the knowledge piece and the skill piece and the experience piece they're all important gaps to fill the experience one can be really tricky sometimes because if you just for example if you haven't worked in Tech you haven't worked in Tech like that's just the situation at the moment I will get to in a couple more tips some examples of how you can still gain experience um even having not had a job in a particular field but um I think so we will get to that but focusing on your Knowledge and Skills and beefing those up as much as possible so you gain confidence you gain experience in that way and you can really speak to those skills will hopefully be enough plus a little bit of um some lowrisk experiments that you'll be learning about in just a minute so hold that question what was the biggest mindset adjustment that supported your journey in changing careers what a good question um that is a great question I'd say that I for me I have a couple ideas for me it is about not fearing failure or rejection knowing that this is going to involve as I mentioned earlier some grit and some scrappiness um so that was a big adjustment of being like you know what if this doesn't work I'm not going to die I'll be okay I'll still have a job I'll still be able to support my family like it's okay it's this is just something I'm going to try let's see what happens so that that was really helpful to me and I know that's much easier said than done but kind of just realizing life is short I want to try things that I want to try let's see let's see how it goes and if it doesn't go well I'll pivot to something else so kind of just having that confidence and trust in yourself that you'll figure it out and you'll be okay no matter what so I I know I can't just say think that way and then you'll be able to think that way but that's that was a really helpful mindset adjustment for me so recommend it um more questions what should I write in my brand statement if I have no experience in that field from Raphael yes um so that's that's totally okay if you have no experience in that field you you still have knowledge you still have skills you still have things to speak to you're still unique person with unique offerings I would just highlight those what is your perspective what do you care about what do you not care about basically like for example my um my brand blurb about Learning and Development talked about I care a lot about clear communication from my experience as an interpreter and I've also worked as an editor That's Unique a lot of people in Learning and Development might not care that much about communication but care about some other aspect of it but I highlighted that because that was a unique skill set that I had that does apply to this particular particular field that not many other people are talking about so it made me stand out as this is something I'm really good at it's really important to me it's part of the quality that I'm going to provide you if you hire me awesome thanks everybody great great questions I think I got through all of them and I think we can move on don't worry we're going to pause for questions again so feel free to keep thinking about them but great questions let's move on to the second half of our tips time for part two we are more than halfway there so to recap you have reflected on your goals you have identified your gaps you have started to upskill yourself and you've defined your personal brand and what you have to offer thanks to all of that preparation you are finally ready to make a move and actually pivot your career tip number five is everyone's favorite thing in the world networking I know the majority of people dread networking but it really truly does work and I'm going to explain why so according to the book designing your life by Bill Bernett and Dave Evans only about 5% of jobs are landed through the traditional model of sending resumés and cover letters through job applications 5% and as if that wasn't bad enough only about 20% of available jobs are even posted online that means 80% of the jobs that are out there are never posted anywhere where you can find them so what does all of this mean you have to network I know but believe me it is worth it so how do you find people to network with LinkedIn is an incredible resource for this and it is completely free there are other professional networking sites like handshake and many others out there that you are welcome to explore but let's just focus on LinkedIn today because it is probably the most wellknown so how do you find people first make sure that your LinkedIn profile is up toate and complete with your brand blurb and your resume and your photo and everything uh and then add everybody you know so connect with your childhood classmates and your professors and your former colleagues and your second cousins and your pickle ball Partners literally everyone as long as you don't have a bad relationship with them add them that is the point of LinkedIn it is all about building a network then search among your first connections to see if anyone is working in the field or the role that you are interested in if dozens of people fall into this category among your first connections then you are in great shape but if very few or none show up uh that's fine it just means it's time to consider some second level connections and you'll have to consider who among your first connections you feel comfortable enough asking for an introduction to a second level connection that you find that can be a really handy way to make a connection but now let's talk about how you actually Network when you found somebody that you want to network with whether you know them person Al or a mutual connection has introduced you to them it's time to ask for an informational interview informational interviews are low risk for both parties involved you are just asking to hear about their career path and current work and ask for some advice that's it and remember most people enjoy talking about themselves and most people enjoy giving advice uh so don't feel bad about asking for this but if they say no or if they don't respond do not take it personally you have lots and lots of options available to you so when you ask for your informational interview you can use part of your elevator pitch or your personal brand to introduce yourself and your goals you I I recommend you probably need to tweak it to make it sound a little less salesy like not something that would read from a resume but it's a great way to describe yourself and say hey this is who I am this is what I've been doing this is what I want to do this is what I have to offer so uh consider using it when introducing yourself or when talking to them live and then make sure uh oh sorry then ask uh 20 to 30 minutes of their time to hear about how they got into the field and what advice they might have for you and then make sure that you are prepared with a list of thoughtful questions to ask ahead of the interview so read their profile in advance to ask them personal questions about their own career your journey consider what aspects of their job you are most curious about and write down those questions ask them for advice on how to break into the field or what skills are most important Etc and remember you are running this meeting so have an agenda prepared have your questions written down take ownership of the conversation and don't go over time unless they say it's okay to go over and then if the conversation goes well well you can casually ask at the end if they know of any current openings that would be a good fit for you if they say no no problem you can just ask if there's anyone else they recommend you talk to and just like that you are networking again now it's time for our fifth activity if you have a LinkedIn account please log in and search for people that you'd like to network with in the field you're interested in and write down three names or three people that you'd like to talk to if you don't have LinkedIn I do highly recommend you get it but you don't have to do that right now uh you can search other social networking sites you have or even just pause and think about who in your life might be a good starting point to network with or who might be a good Mutual connection that can introduce you to somebody and write down three names as well I will play some music and give you about two or so minutes about 30 seconds okay I love that someone wrote in the chat they wrote down 10 names that is fantastic uh I do recommend when you are ready to do your pivot to network with dozens and dozens of people to increase your potential opportunities and it will get easier every time you do it I promise okay while you are actively networking it's time to run some lowrisk experiments so this might speak to one of the questions that we got earlier this will help you build your skills boost your resume and confirm again that this is the right career for you so here are some examples of what a lowrisk experiment might look like you could ask for opportunities to use this skills that you're interested in in your current work so for example you could take on a small coding project if you want to learn to code you could test your skills on Friends and family by doing some work for them for free like building them a website you could offer your services through a contractor Marketplace and take on some small gigs to see how that goes you could start a book club among likeminded friends who want to discuss or even practice these skills or an Enterprise Resource Group at your place of work for those who are interested in discussing this particular subject matter you could participate in online community spaces and forums to help others by answering their questions or addressing their challenges such as community at Co Academy and you could volunteer in the space that you're interested in so the way I went about this when I was pivoting from project manager to Learning and Development was I found a parttime job sorry a parttime volunteer job uh as a learning and development manager at a startup company so I worked about 5 to 10 hours per week for free in addition to my fulltime job and I developed Learning and Development content with a team of other volunteers this was an excellent way to test my skills and build my confidence and gain some leadership experience and experiment with my instructional design process via trial and error and a safe and lowrisk environment because I wasn't being paid and I added this role to my resume under my volunteering section and I'm certain that it helped me land my first instructional design job which I started just three months later it is time for our sixth activity I recommend that you go to volunteermatch.org and search a keyword based on the career that you'd like to Pivot into you will have to uh on the homepage click on find Opportunities there's a button at the top and then that will bring you to a page where you can filter through keywords or uh by virtual or in person or by skills or causes that you care about but you have to like you have to click that button first to get to that filter page so this website is how I found my Learning and Development volunteer role you'd be surprised how many business related volunteer jobs there are and I ask that you do a little search note anything that pops up that might interest you in your activities document I'll play some music and give you about two minutes about 30 seconds okay welcome back again after this live stream is over I recommend continuing to search for volunteer opportunities if this is a lowrisk experiment that interests you if not definitely explore some of the other ideas that I shared and now for our final tip it is time to plan your route as in my own career Journey uh pivots often don't happen overnight or in one simple step you might remember that I pivoted from a project manager at a real estate firm to a project manager at an educational company to an instructional designer for the federal government to an instructional designer at a private company and each of these jobs were strategic Stepping Stones to eventually land my ideal job the famous career advice book called what color is Your Parachute by Richard n BS outlines the three different ways that you can pivot your career and I thought it was an excellent way to describe this so I am going to provide the example that is in the book so in this example you are currently an accountant in the television industry but you want to be a reporter in medicine or in healthcare the most difficult path would be to Pivot in one step and change both your job title and your industry at the same time it can be done but the chances of success are much lower and it's a pretty big uphill battle so the easier way is to break down your pivot into two steps you can either pivot your title first while staying in the same industry or pivot your industry first while keeping the same title so as you can see on this diagram if you go from a to c you change your title from accountant to reporter while staying in the television industry or if you go from A to B you keep working as an accountant but you switch from television to medicine and then after you work in that space for a little while you build up your experience you build up your resume you're ready to make that final pivot over to D as a reporter in medicine and the route that you take can and will be unique to you and your current situation but it's important to plan your route in advance while also leaving room for flexibility if things change or opportunities arise so time for our seventh activity let's take two minutes to write down a few different roots that you could take to Pivot your career so what would it look like if you changed your title first or if you changed your industry first or what would be a good first job to aim for or what other possible routes could you take there are no wrong answers here this is just a brainstorming activity to get you thinking about the different creative approaches you could take I'll give you about two minutes while I play some music about 30 seconds okay awesome job I hope that you continue to work on your strategy for getting from your current job to your ideal job and consider different routes that you can take this marks the end of our seven tips I think I'm just going to power through and wrap up with our uh final activity and then we will have plenty of time for Q&A at the end okay my friends we've made it through our seven tips let's quickly recap them and then I will I'd like to wrap up with some goal settings so that all your hard work today doesn't go to waste I knew I know I just threw a lot out at you so let's recap what these seven tis are while you are preparing to Pivot first reflect reflect on your goals your priorities what matters to you why you're even doing this identify your knowledge gaps your skill gaps and your experience gaps work on upskilling yourself through lowcost or free options and Define your personal brand and what you have to offer the worlds then it's time to make your move network network network run lowrisk experiments to test your skills and build your confidence and finally plan your route from your current job to your ideal job it's finally time for our very last activity reflect on your notes from all of the activities that we did today and then set one achievable goal for yourself that you will complete this week that will move you one step closer to pivoting your career so for example maybe your goal is to read 10 job postings that interest you and jot down your knowledge and skill gaps or maybe update your LinkedIn profile and connect with everyone you know or maybe register for the code academy course that you've had your eye on for a while those are just some examples but take about two minutes and set a goal for yourself about 30 seconds okay thank you so much for doing those eight activities uh I hope that this last one gives you an idea of what it feels like to break down your pivot into small and manageable goals um so that you can be successful it's uh it's very it's very helpful to chunk things down set a goal for yourself a week or whatever time frame works for you so that you don't get overwhelmed I want to thank you all for your time and your participation today you've been an incredible audience thank you for all the lovely comments in the chat you've accomplished a lot during our short time together so I hope you feel very proud of yourselves if you want to dive into these Concepts even deeper with a career coach please contact me I offer a free consultation and if you mention this live stream I will offer 20% off any of my services my email and website and Linkedin are on the slide and I will also ask Fede if he doesn't mind to put these links in the chat once again both my uh free consultation link as well as my website I want to thank you all for joining me today and now I will pass it back over to fet to see if you all have questions that I can answer for you fantastic I definitely know that I learned something new today so I hope that the audience did too um always great to see people in the chat asking questions actually I saw a question question from way earlier when we started the live stream uh Kaye was actually curious to know what got you into being a sign language interpreter oh very interesting question um so actually my grandmother was deaf she became deaf later in life like in in her mid40s very suddenly so she actually never learned sign language but she was my exposure to a deaf person for for the very first time and she encouraged my interest in Sign Language I was curious about the death Community I was curious about the language so she would buy me books and videos on sign language I also think the language just spoke to me in a unique way because of I was a quiet kid I lik the idea of expressing myself in a quiet way I also was a dancer and I felt like expressing myself through movement made so much more sense to me so I was really drawn to it for many different reasons and I dabbled in it as I got older and finally when I graduated from college I said you know what I really want to try this I want to see if this is something I could do so it was really I'm so grateful for that time even though I'm not currently pursuing it it's so cool to have learned that language I guess in a way it's almost like you pivoted into another language so maybe your first ever pivot that's a good point I'm sure we've all been pivoting since a very young age without even realizing it I see that Kimberly has a question for you in the chat okay Kimberly let's see how important is physical relocation when switching a career especially when that field has a geographical hub for example Silicon Valley oh good question um you know again I think that is a caseby case basis there are so many jobs these days especially in Tech that you can do online you I think since Co hit we all have really adapted to doing things virtually I personally think most jobs can be done virtually um but it depends on the employer right it depends on what matters to them it depends on what kind of opportunities they provide remotely so there's a few different ways you could go about this if if it does not interest you at all to relocate then that's totally fine that's a boundary you set for yourself you only look for remote work or work exactly where you are located if you're open to it maybe do a little bit of research first to see what kinds of companies or organizations in that particular ular geographical location interest you what would it take to get those jobs see what kinds of opportunities would be available to you before actually making that move so that it isn't done in vain um and again I think working with a career coach on the pros and cons and kind of just digging deeper into the root reasoning for this move or not for this move would be really helpful so I I recommend talking it through with a coach or with a a close person in your life great and while while we wait for other people to drop their questions I actually have one myself and it's related to the seven steps and you know we talked about reflecting and visualizing the journey what you're going to have to do next um how one of the problems that we run a lot into in our community spaces here for people trying to Pivot into Tech is that NE that sense that never goes away of impostor syndrome of I'm not good enough I don't have the correct background I don't have the correct like experience like I'm not going to be taken seriously so when you're working through this and you're trying to put it all together so you can have a successful career pivot uh do you have any tips on how to overcome that dread feeling of imposter syndrome and not maybe feeling like you don't belong where you're trying to go what a great question um there's so much we could talk about around impostor syndrome it's play so many people these days it's a real thing uh first I will say you have so many skills so much knowledge and so much experience whether or not you have ever worked in this particular role or this particular industry so you need to remind yourself of that you have so much to offer you're already a very talented person it's just about channeling your past experience and those talents in the right direction in the direction that you're aiming for so be kind to yourself and remember that you have so much to offer uh there are as far as individual tips because of course easier said than done to just remember this about yourself um working with a coach or someone else close to you as far as actually doing some activities like brainstorming and writing down all the different skills you have to offer let's see how long that list can get writing down those transferable skills you can do lots of different um games and activities and and just brainstorming sessions with somebody like a career coach that can help you reframe your thinking reset your mindset um also you can dig a little bit deeper into like truly what's causing this impostor syndrome so I do recommend talking to people that you feel comfortable talking to digging into what's really causing it to identify the root problem but all that to say you have no reason to have impostor syndrome I promise you you are totally capable and you can make this move in just a few months if that's what you want to do you are ready you are capable and you can you can uh Take On The World we are ready wow thank you for the inspiration I see that we have one more question coming from Mr gichi okay do you have any advice in terms of competing against people with collegeuniversity degrees versus being selftaught oo that's a good one um um let's see so I mean I'm I'm a great example of that actually instructional design is a degree you can get a bachelor's or a master's possibly even a PhD in instructional design I do not have any of those but I have other degrees I have other pieces of experience that I highlighted I find that it will be employer dependent some employers for whatever reason care so much about academics not a whole lot you can do there if is a priority for them but I'd say most these days are being more flexible about it um for me I just beefed up my resume in a way that made me look really experienced I I happen to have a master's degree it's not an instructional design but it never hurts to just have something right um and I think I I was all I had everything that was needed to be considered um if you are in a particular industry where the college or university degree is huge is highly important I think maybe getting some certifications something like not as Grand a scale as going back to school for multiple years but maybe spending a couple thousand dollars on some certifications or online courses so you can show you are academically trained in this space and then again it's all about the way you design your resume your profile the way that you brand yourself and I'd be happy to chat with you in a a free online consultation if you want to talk more about uh what your challenges are fantastic all right I don't see any other I don't see any other questions in the chat so I guess I'll just go ahead and ask a bonus question for me and that is um when thinking about pivoting careers I've heard of some recruiters that say that there's a really fine line between being exploratory and interested in a field and coming across not coming across unattached or not serious enough where sometimes recruiter will say well you know if we are hiring somebody that is in a jior role maybe you're coming with no experience but they're still willing to take a chance on you based on your past experience or things that are related to the role um they still want to hire somebody that seems to be serious I guess about that role in that career so do you think that there is something to it about uh identifying yourself as a pivot pivot I guess or saying yeah I worked in a different field but now this is what I want to do and how you communicate that that doesn't mean that you're not has fully committed to that field as somebody that has more experience or that has done it in the past yeah yeah um I think you pretty much answered your question there I think it's all about the way that you communicate your your past your present and your future goals so I think it's always a good idea to be transparent meaning saying you know what I was sign language interpreter for seven years it's kind of funny to think about that now it's not related to what I do I did it for these reasons I learned so many things from this but I also learned it wasn't the right fit for me and during that time I did some real selfexploration and discovered that i' much rather be doing this and I think just being able to tell your story makes you interesting makes you trustworthy because you're willing to share I don't think it should in my opinion harm your chances at all I think it makes you human and I think a lot of people these days appreciate diverse backgrounds some people are in the same field for 20 30 40 years that's fine they're obviously incredible at what they do but I also think we have we put a lot of um weight and praise around people who tried a lot of things had a lot of life experience so I don't think it should hurt you I think it just comes down to being able to tell that story in a way that makes it sound like it actually helped you it helped build your character build your knowledge and experience and it's only a benefit to your future career okay so with that I reposted all the chat in the chat all the links and please I would like to first thank you so much mine for stopping by and sharing all this awesome knowledge with all of us today I
