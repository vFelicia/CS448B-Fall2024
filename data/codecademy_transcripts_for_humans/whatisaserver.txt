00:00 - let's talk about browsers and servers
00:03 - this video will teach you about their
00:04 - purpose and how they contribute to the
00:06 - giant network that we know as the
00:07 - internet
00:08 - what happens when you request a website
00:10 - in your browser
00:12 - well every time you type a web address
00:13 - and press enter a series of things
00:15 - happen in the few seconds it takes for
00:17 - the website to appear on your screen
00:21 - over recent decades there have been many
00:23 - web browsers
00:24 - some of the most popular today are
00:26 - chrome firefox safari internet explorer
00:29 - and opera all of these browsers serve
00:31 - the same basic purpose to display
00:33 - websites for you to read and interact
00:35 - with
00:36 - but just how do they do this first the
00:39 - browser takes the web address you
00:40 - provided and sends a request to a server
00:43 - across the internet for the files that
00:44 - make up the website
00:46 - the contacted server is dedicated to
00:48 - holding the website's files
00:50 - it may even be thousands of miles away
00:51 - from you and your device
00:54 - once the server receives the request it
00:56 - contains logic for processing the
00:58 - request
00:58 - and identifying the files and data that
01:00 - the client has specified
01:02 - it responds to the browser's request
01:03 - with the necessary files
01:05 - this is a process that allows the
01:07 - browser to display website files to you
01:09 - and it happens in the few seconds it
01:11 - takes for websites to load on your
01:12 - device screen
01:14 - you may be asking yourself what is a
01:16 - server a server is a specialized
01:19 - computer connected to a network
01:21 - the role of this computer is to listen
01:22 - for requests from network devices and
01:24 - send back data
01:26 - servers provide or serve up resources
01:28 - like website files
01:29 - data and assets like images or videos
01:31 - along with other cool things
01:33 - servers are not like the computers you
01:34 - may be used to they are focused on data
01:37 - storage and retrieval so they have no
01:38 - monitors or keyboards
01:41 - a server will need lots of computing
01:42 - power to serve up websites that reach
01:44 - thousands or even millions of users
01:46 - next we need to understand how the
01:48 - browsers and servers understand each
01:50 - other
01:50 - the internet follows protocols or rules
01:53 - that govern the format
01:54 - of data sent over the internet or other
01:55 - networks browsers and servers
01:57 - communicate with one another using the
01:59 - internet protocol
02:00 - known as http you've seen this before
02:03 - http or hypertext transfer protocol
02:06 - allows for data transfer
02:08 - when you see the s at the end of http
02:10 - the data is being transferred securely
02:13 - an important part of the hypertext
02:15 - transfer protocol is that each request
02:17 - has a request
02:18 - method that specifies the type of
02:19 - request being made
02:21 - for example if the user is just asking
02:23 - to fetch a resource this is specified as
02:25 - a get request
02:27 - if a user is sending data to the server
02:29 - for example such as submitting
02:31 - information via form this is specified
02:33 - as a post request
02:37 - when the server sends back a response it
02:38 - sends a status code that accompanies the
02:40 - requested resource
02:42 - you might be familiar with scene 404
02:44 - error messages when browsing the
02:45 - internet
02:46 - this is an http response code that
02:48 - indicates that the requested content
02:49 - wasn't found
02:51 - http provides reliable structure to the
02:53 - interplay between the client and the
02:55 - server
02:56 - let's review what we learned today there
02:57 - are three important things to remember
03:01 - one the browser sends requests to the
03:03 - server and displays or renders website
03:05 - files
03:06 - two the server stores website files and
03:08 - sends them to the web browser upon
03:10 - request
03:11 - three http or hypertext transfer
03:13 - protocol is a standardized set of rules
03:15 - for how browsers and servers transfer
03:17 - data
03:18 - to one another

let's talk about browsers and servers this video will teach you about their purpose and how they contribute to the giant network that we know as the internet what happens when you request a website in your browser well every time you type a web address and press enter a series of things happen in the few seconds it takes for the website to appear on your screen over recent decades there have been many web browsers some of the most popular today are chrome firefox safari internet explorer and opera all of these browsers serve the same basic purpose to display websites for you to read and interact with but just how do they do this first the browser takes the web address you provided and sends a request to a server across the internet for the files that make up the website the contacted server is dedicated to holding the website's files it may even be thousands of miles away from you and your device once the server receives the request it contains logic for processing the request and identifying the files and data that the client has specified it responds to the browser's request with the necessary files this is a process that allows the browser to display website files to you and it happens in the few seconds it takes for websites to load on your device screen you may be asking yourself what is a server a server is a specialized computer connected to a network the role of this computer is to listen for requests from network devices and send back data servers provide or serve up resources like website files data and assets like images or videos along with other cool things servers are not like the computers you may be used to they are focused on data storage and retrieval so they have no monitors or keyboards a server will need lots of computing power to serve up websites that reach thousands or even millions of users next we need to understand how the browsers and servers understand each other the internet follows protocols or rules that govern the format of data sent over the internet or other networks browsers and servers communicate with one another using the internet protocol known as http you've seen this before http or hypertext transfer protocol allows for data transfer when you see the s at the end of http the data is being transferred securely an important part of the hypertext transfer protocol is that each request has a request method that specifies the type of request being made for example if the user is just asking to fetch a resource this is specified as a get request if a user is sending data to the server for example such as submitting information via form this is specified as a post request when the server sends back a response it sends a status code that accompanies the requested resource you might be familiar with scene 404 error messages when browsing the internet this is an http response code that indicates that the requested content wasn't found http provides reliable structure to the interplay between the client and the server let's review what we learned today there are three important things to remember one the browser sends requests to the server and displays or renders website files two the server stores website files and sends them to the web browser upon request three http or hypertext transfer protocol is a standardized set of rules for how browsers and servers transfer data to one another
