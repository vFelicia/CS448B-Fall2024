00:00 - go live
00:08 - okay well we're live
00:11 - thank you zep for stopping by today
00:14 - i
00:14 - think i want to start by asking you the
00:17 - basic questions if you can introduce
00:19 - yourself
00:20 - tell me you know a little bit about your
00:22 - background and what you do
00:24 - true
00:25 - um so i'm gerard i work at codecademy on
00:28 - the content platform team so basically
00:31 - we're responsible for all the stuff that
00:32 - gets submitted to codecademy so many
00:35 - quizzes articles
00:37 - uh lessons things like that um so that's
00:39 - what i do currently
00:41 - before that i was teaching at a boot
00:45 - camp called general assembly
00:47 - about a couple other odd tech jobs um
00:50 - here in the states but before that i was
00:53 - teaching english in
00:54 - taiwan
00:56 - wow
00:57 - wait so you go from english teaching
00:59 - english to teaching at a boat camp okay
01:01 - that's that's a bit of a gap
01:03 - uh how did that happen
01:06 - yeah i
01:07 - i guess i described it as like uh
01:10 - if you sail at all like when you're
01:11 - sailing you're supposed to attack which
01:13 - means like
01:14 - you go
01:15 - uh kind of towards the wind to the right
01:17 - and then to the left and to the right
01:18 - and to the left so that way you're not
01:19 - facing directly into the wind
01:22 - so it's kind of the same thing like
01:24 - my my parents uh were both teachers
01:27 - and i was i know i don't want to be like
01:30 - my parents let me
01:31 - go get a math degree
01:33 - and then
01:34 - uh
01:35 - i graduated in 2009 which wasn't a great
01:38 - time for getting jobs so my way to
01:42 - to find some meaningful work was to go
01:43 - abroad to taiwan and teach english
01:46 - and then doing that for two and a half
01:47 - years i started to miss technology so i
01:49 - came back to the states and
01:51 - worked at a software company called
01:53 - netbrain and then another one called in
01:55 - bravada and then i was feeling the other
01:57 - problem which is well now i miss
01:59 - teaching because i'm doing all this
02:00 - technology work so luckily at codecademy
02:02 - those things have kind of come together
02:05 - nice so coding teaching teaching coding
02:08 - yeah i mean
02:10 - do you was there any point where you
02:11 - thought well i guess since it's going to
02:12 - end up being a college professor or
02:14 - something like computer science like
02:16 - what's that kind of like what's that
02:17 - point in your life where you're like i
02:18 - want to teach and i like code this seems
02:21 - to be the only possible way
02:23 - yeah i i think again probably the main
02:26 - reason that that didn't happen was uh
02:28 - graduating university in 2009 meant that
02:31 - that's what all my other friends were
02:33 - doing and i think it seems like there is
02:35 - a
02:36 - pretty large amount of people who are
02:38 - going back to school and getting a
02:40 - second degree because the job market's
02:41 - still not where it should be
02:43 - um and i just didn't i didn't want to be
02:45 - part of that mass of people going to get
02:48 - a doctorate or a law degree
02:50 - okay i mean fair i guess just sometimes
02:53 - yeah
02:54 - it's just uh it's not where you see
02:56 - yourself and it's better not to try
02:58 - again so you try new things i mean it
02:59 - takes some some guts you know to uh go
03:02 - in a different direction like everybody
03:03 - else like
03:04 - you probably thinking maybe i made a
03:06 - mistake maybe maybe this group of people
03:08 - had it right and i should have seems
03:10 - like it worked out
03:12 - certainly in the beginning yeah i mean
03:13 - because i
03:14 - uh
03:16 - graduated college and
03:18 - i i could get by with spanish and i
03:20 - could speak english or looking at you
03:22 - know places to teach english in latin
03:23 - america instead and the jobs just
03:25 - weren't there
03:27 - um the school year was the opposite
03:29 - so they ended up going to taiwan red
03:31 - didn't speak any chinese at all so it's
03:33 - definitely a big culture shock to just
03:35 - get kind of thrown in there um
03:37 - yeah they're definitely in the first
03:38 - couple months regretting that uh
03:40 - decision
03:41 - i was a little bit scary but uh towards
03:43 - the end that i wouldn't trade it for the
03:45 - world
03:46 - nice that's awesome you um
03:49 - did you always see yourself once you
03:51 - were going to the coding down the coding
03:53 - path
03:54 - the technology that you use nowadays do
03:56 - you start with those or was it more like
03:58 - an exploration of trying different
04:00 - programming languages and different
04:02 - uh fields and then sort of like
04:04 - realizing which one interested you the
04:05 - most
04:07 - yeah there's certainly a lot of
04:08 - exploration i think i made
04:10 - a lot of i guess mistakes in the
04:12 - beginning just trying to figure it out
04:14 - on my own and i
04:16 - while i had friends who were coders i
04:19 - don't know that i had a mentor so i was
04:21 - just kind of like trying whatever would
04:23 - work
04:23 - um and then you know i'll make a i'll
04:26 - make a game in python i think one thing
04:29 - that i made was like a pizza
04:31 - falling towards the
04:34 - hungry
04:35 - character like okay cool i guess i did
04:37 - that
04:38 - pizza's falling eating right then you
04:40 - get 100 points and you win
04:42 - um and then it kind of pivoted towards
04:44 - web development for
04:46 - i think a couple reasons the first one
04:48 - is it's just so easy to see what's
04:50 - happening
04:51 - in web development you save something
04:53 - refresh the page and oh cool it's blue
04:55 - now right
04:57 - and then on top of that
04:59 - exactly exactly whereas
05:02 - if you're
05:03 - kind of more
05:04 - heavy
05:06 - um
05:06 - like python java things like this like
05:09 - you can make a chess game but it's not
05:11 - as obvious like how you would make those
05:14 - chess pieces show up um they immediately
05:16 - show up in my development
05:17 - um
05:19 - in general assembly um i was lucky
05:21 - enough that the general assembly had
05:22 - started uh their new office
05:25 - in denver just when i moved out there
05:28 - and that's the first the first course
05:29 - they always have is the web development
05:31 - course so
05:32 - that kind of pushed me even further in
05:33 - that direction
05:34 - i think that that's a very common theme
05:37 - with a lot of learners at code academy
05:39 - is that when they start to learn
05:40 - something like python or even web
05:42 - development at the beginning at the
05:43 - beginning it's very dry you learn html
05:46 - you learn css it's a very vanilla
05:49 - you don't really you see the big
05:50 - websites from big companies and all this
05:52 - and the social media places you are in
05:54 - and they're so sophisticated and a lot
05:57 - of people want to get there quickly and
05:59 - it's it's not always it's not very
06:01 - obvious the amount of learning you have
06:03 - to do or how much of it or it can be it
06:05 - can be a little bit of a
06:07 - hurdle to it for people to to
06:10 - visualize where they're trying to go and
06:12 - stay with it so that's why i was curious
06:14 - to know how you got into web development
06:16 - because uh you know a lot of people say
06:19 - well i started with this i did a bit of
06:20 - html javascript but it got boring or
06:22 - like you know by the time i got to the
06:24 - react part i was just like not
06:26 - interested anymore
06:28 - um did you when you were learning
06:31 - did you do anything to stay motivated
06:33 - like finding online communities or
06:35 - having any sort of like people to talk
06:38 - to or were you just like self-driven do
06:40 - you have any any advice on that
06:43 - um i think the biggest thing that i
06:46 - found is is trying to find the skill
06:49 - uh that that you see in demand either in
06:51 - your workplace or or in
06:54 - a position that you want to apply for
06:56 - and something that that you want to do
06:57 - so if somebody's trying to
07:00 - get into web development and they're
07:01 - like oh well react in angular those are
07:03 - two different frameworks i'm not sure
07:04 - which one i should choose
07:06 - but you're seeing a lot more job
07:07 - opportunities for react well then you
07:09 - have a reason to do it not just to grow
07:12 - but also uh this this can keep me
07:15 - growing
07:16 - if i'm going to find a job where i can
07:18 - do it 40 hours a week
07:20 - it'll it'll put a little more i don't
07:22 - know jet fuel behind you
07:24 - so you don't have to just be self-driven
07:28 - and rely on yourself i think the
07:30 - that's one big thing um the other big
07:33 - thing that
07:34 - um when you were saying like how
07:36 - uh how did i end up in web development i
07:38 - think a lot of that was hackathon driven
07:40 - to be honest you know just going out and
07:42 - meeting people and building random stuff
07:45 - and that i think kind of informed
07:48 - uh well i want to make this fun hobby
07:50 - project with a couple other people
07:52 - um and that's
07:54 - that'll keep me going too you know
07:56 - another couple months working on this
07:57 - project that i really like what
07:58 - technology do we all decide on oh cool
08:01 - that's the one that i'm learning on
08:02 - codecademy right now or something like
08:04 - that
08:05 - that's cool it's um
08:07 - i think the hackathons help a lot for
08:09 - people that are very um
08:11 - sort of like results oriented and i know
08:13 - that you touched on how you went to web
08:15 - development because you can immediately
08:16 - see you can refresh the page
08:18 - your change is there um and i know that
08:21 - that helps a lot of people stay
08:22 - motivated is that when they build
08:24 - something and they see what the impact
08:25 - of it is and with hackathons that's sort
08:27 - of like the end point right like the
08:29 - point of a hackathon is you build
08:30 - something at the end so
08:32 - it really drives people to stay with it
08:35 - um
08:36 - i know that there's a bit of a drop off
08:39 - when people are learning and
08:42 - towards the middle where maybe it gets a
08:43 - little more dry or a bit more
08:45 - theoretical in in things with framework
08:48 - something is there
08:50 - um
08:51 - did you find anything in particular to
08:53 - be challenging or something that you say
08:55 - well
08:56 - i'm just gonna have to remind myself why
08:58 - i'm here or why i'm trying to do this or
09:00 - i mean i don't know if there's any
09:01 - shortcuts in learning some of this stuff
09:03 - like
09:04 - you just just gotta memorize it i guess
09:07 - um well i think the good thing uh
09:10 - the good thing about
09:12 - millennials get a bad rap right because
09:14 - uh
09:15 - we're so dependent on technology um but
09:18 - that's exactly what makes someone a
09:21 - successful developer is
09:23 - you don't need to know everything um but
09:26 - if you know where you're going to look
09:28 - to find it um then you don't you don't
09:30 - need to memorize all those things
09:32 - um and so i think that's the
09:34 - that's that's one thing that that really
09:36 - helps when things are getting um
09:38 - super dry like do i really need to study
09:40 - this well no if i have a couple links
09:42 - that i can go back to that's that's
09:44 - enough let's move on to the next thing
09:46 - let's move on to something that's a
09:47 - little more fun um
09:48 - i think that's a that's a big part of it
09:51 - um
09:52 - yeah okay
09:53 - yeah so i guess uh it's sort of like
09:55 - you
09:56 - it's okay to it's okay to just be
09:58 - scrappy with some of what you know if
10:00 - you if at least you know where to look
10:02 - for it later when you need it it's sort
10:03 - of like
10:04 - write it write it has a note like this
10:06 - is important and then maybe later when
10:08 - you're building something you need it
10:09 - and at least you know the sources of
10:11 - where to look and finish learning it or
10:14 - um
10:14 - yeah because i feel like sometimes when
10:16 - people are learning to code they see it
10:18 - as a very linear path and and that might
10:20 - be our fault too because of the way we
10:21 - present curriculum is like here's the
10:23 - star line and here's the end line but
10:24 - like you said a lot of times the way
10:26 - that you learn things and the way you
10:28 - end up in places uh you might you might
10:31 - be learning javascript and then maybe
10:33 - all of a sudden you're interested in the
10:35 - back end and you have eric curious about
10:36 - hollow by canelo you can back go that
10:38 - way then come back later finish the the
10:41 - end of the front end
10:42 - um
10:43 - so that that's a really good point about
10:47 - not being too linear in the way that you
10:49 - learn things and just kind of like go
10:51 - with the flow a bit
10:52 - um i'm curious um
10:54 - when you mentioned earlier the boot camp
10:57 - did you spend a lot of time trying to
10:59 - decide on a boot camp because a lot of
11:01 - our learners at code academy they're
11:03 - they're in that same spot they're
11:05 - thinking okay there's like 10 15
11:07 - bootcamps in new york which one is the
11:09 - best which one is the one that's gonna
11:10 - get me a job
11:12 - um
11:13 - do you have to spend a lot of time
11:14 - thinking about that
11:17 - um well luckily for me there are really
11:19 - only the two options
11:20 - at the time um
11:22 - in in colorado that we're hiring there
11:24 - was there was galvanize in general
11:25 - assembly
11:26 - um and general assembly was was new
11:29 - enough that they they were
11:31 - trying to hire really aggressively
11:34 - um i think as far as
11:36 - as far as choosing which boot camp to go
11:38 - to as a as a student i think
11:42 - i can't overstate just how important
11:44 - having a good instructional team is and
11:46 - so often you know people try to make uh
11:49 - comparisons about oh well this company
11:51 - is better let's go to flatiron school
11:52 - let's go to general assembly um but
11:55 - there's so much to be said for the the
11:56 - people that are actually delivering um
11:58 - that curriculum
12:00 - and i think what i'd recommend to
12:01 - everyone it's kind of what i would
12:03 - recommend if you're job searching too is
12:04 - to have kind of a comparison attitude
12:07 - you should be looking at
12:08 - a few different schools and you should
12:10 - be interviewing them as well as they're
12:12 - interviewing you um see if you like the
12:15 - the people that are giving these courses
12:16 - and usually i know this is true for
12:18 - general assembly and galvanized um
12:20 - usually those teachers um that are
12:23 - actually teaching the full-time boot
12:24 - camps or the part-time courses they'll
12:26 - do kind of one-off either
12:29 - promotional
12:30 - lessons
12:31 - where they're just like okay let's teach
12:32 - you the very very basics of html and
12:34 - javascript like let's get a website that
12:36 - says hi you know that sort of thing um
12:39 - or they have open houses
12:40 - i've been studying here in new york i've
12:42 - been to i've been to a couple of those
12:44 - uh i found them on meetup.com i got just
12:46 - browsing around like oh
12:48 - uh this one bootcamp is doing some uh
12:50 - some like three hour workshop free
12:52 - workshop on a friday and like i would
12:54 - stop by and stuff and yeah it's like you
12:56 - said they showcase some of it like look
12:57 - at look at our offices and look at the
12:59 - desk and like here's what you would
13:00 - study and they try to really make it all
13:03 - like very cozy uh trying to tell you hey
13:05 - you know next cohorts next month
13:09 - yep
13:09 - yeah that's that's the big thing i would
13:11 - say is is look for the people like does
13:14 - it feel good when when you're being
13:16 - interviewed does does it feel natural
13:18 - when you see one of those instructors
13:20 - actually teaching and then and then
13:22 - choose that uh whatever feels right as
13:24 - far as the instructional experience
13:26 - you'll get does it matter the background
13:28 - that you have
13:29 - and i mean there
13:31 - since there's so many choices with boot
13:32 - camps especially if you're in a big city
13:35 - does it matter for example um how you
13:37 - choose a bootcamp depends on if you
13:39 - already have like this computer science
13:41 - college degrees that come out and they
13:43 - get a bookcon to be job ready versus
13:45 - someone that's totally new for to tech
13:47 - or someone that might have some
13:49 - experience with online courses
13:51 - that's does where you come from
13:53 - make an impact in the kind of bootcamp
13:56 - that you like i mean that you that will
13:57 - work for you or is it just always comes
13:59 - down to the people like you said um i
14:02 - think it does or at least there's an
14:03 - intent there uh i know that um the the
14:07 - galvanized approach was um
14:10 - let's let's get you into
14:12 - a part-time course or something that's a
14:14 - little bit easier so we can
14:16 - engage if you're ready if not let's give
14:18 - you another part-time course and then
14:20 - you'll be ready to start um as a way to
14:23 - try to
14:24 - differentiate
14:25 - learning levels um
14:27 - and i think i think turing does
14:29 - something similar um i can't really
14:30 - speak to other ones because those are
14:32 - the only three that i've ever worked
14:32 - with but um
14:35 - i think that it matters um
14:37 - but it doesn't necessarily matter in the
14:39 - way that people might think like
14:41 - uh i think the the most important thing
14:44 - is that those who have a background in
14:48 - something that's not necessarily
14:49 - development or engineering um they might
14:51 - have a lot of translatable skills to
14:53 - development um
14:56 - the the thing that comes up for me a lot
14:57 - but most people might not think of is
14:59 - like professional weight lifters
15:02 - or like people who are personal trainers
15:05 - um
15:05 - they're remarkably in my experience
15:07 - they're remarkably adept at switching
15:09 - that set of skills to learning how to
15:12 - code 12 13 hours a day because
15:15 - my thought and what some of them said to
15:18 - me is like
15:19 - well that's what we do you know we're
15:21 - working out
15:22 - every day you know several hours a day
15:24 - and we know if we don't hit
15:27 - whatever goal we're trying to set we
15:29 - need to come into the gym early tomorrow
15:30 - and do it again um and so that that i
15:33 - think really feeds into it well um as
15:35 - well
15:36 - but yeah i think definitely experience
15:38 - matters
15:39 - um i mean
15:40 - i was asking because um i was asking
15:42 - because i wonder i'm assuming that the
15:45 - basics of like if you want to be a web
15:47 - developer i would imagine that the
15:48 - curriculum in every bootcamp is like
15:51 - basically very similar and
15:55 - the way that you might decide like okay
15:57 - if you come from a background where you
15:58 - already know some tech or you're already
16:00 - adept at certain skills you might be
16:02 - looking for a bootcamp that goes a bit
16:04 - more fast-paced a bit more project
16:05 - oriented and like i'm assuming that
16:07 - other bootcamps might cover the material
16:08 - over a longer period of time or they
16:10 - might have more support systems in place
16:12 - or more peer reviews or whatever it is
16:15 - um i would imagine that those are all
16:17 - factors that that play into this
16:19 - bootcamp is right for me or that book
16:20 - comes right for me
16:22 - yeah and uh so the last course i taught
16:25 - at general assembly was called sei flex
16:27 - of software engineering immersive flex
16:30 - and that catered to a little bit more
16:33 - folks who are in development but not
16:35 - quite in web development or trying to
16:37 - make a little bit of a career change or
16:38 - just polishing up skills
16:40 - um
16:41 - and i and and those those offerings
16:43 - exist at other boot camps as well um so
16:45 - i think that's that's probably the big
16:47 - thing like do you want to keep your job
16:48 - or at least
16:49 - keep a part-time role while you're going
16:51 - to a boot camp
16:53 - and there are courses specifically for
16:55 - that i don't know if it's like company
16:57 - specific but um there are certainly core
17:00 - specific things and then
17:02 - my my wife also taught uh a react
17:05 - specific not really boot camp but it was
17:08 - i think three days a week for three
17:11 - hours on react so
17:13 - if you feel like you need to you just
17:15 - need those react front-end skills and
17:17 - you feel pretty confident in other
17:19 - things
17:20 - there's usually an offering that will
17:21 - fit into that specific niche
17:24 - okay
17:25 - all right so let's say that i chose my
17:27 - boot camp i'm going to it it's going to
17:29 - be hell it's like
17:31 - 10 hours a day of studying and then i
17:33 - have to do homework for the next day
17:34 - it's going you know it's all kinds of
17:36 - crazy
17:37 - um
17:39 - once you get towards the end of the boot
17:40 - camp and you're starting to think okay i
17:42 - got like two weeks left i should be
17:44 - thinking about what i'm gonna do with
17:45 - this how i'm gonna apply what i'm gonna
17:47 - do
17:49 - how do you leverage what you've learned
17:51 - at bootcamp or like how do you play it
17:53 - to the best uh in the best light so that
17:56 - you do get to the point where you land a
17:58 - job or something like how how do you use
18:00 - boot camps and what you've learned to
18:02 - make that that jump is there like a
18:04 - trick to it or it's just luck
18:07 - there's a few things that i've seen that
18:09 - work really well i think a lot of it is
18:10 - luck a lot of us luck in volume you know
18:12 - the biggest thing is uh like i said
18:14 - before applying to a bunch of places and
18:17 - and often so the first thing is try not
18:20 - to apply to your dream job first because
18:23 - you're unlikely to get that job right
18:25 - away you've got to go at an interview
18:27 - make sure your portfolio is polished
18:29 - um so
18:30 - it's it's not necessarily
18:33 - the most ethical thing i guess but like
18:35 - to go after a job that you're like if i
18:37 - get it i get it if i don't i don't um do
18:40 - that first so you can kind of shake out
18:42 - those nerves i think that's a big thing
18:44 - another big thing that i've seen people
18:46 - do which is really cool
18:48 - is actually work for that company like
18:51 - their final project is a proof of
18:55 - concept which is basically a long-form
18:57 - interview for
18:58 - the company they want to work for like
19:00 - we have this problem
19:01 - uh we can't organize the
19:04 - lawn equipment for our landscaping
19:06 - company and we want a website developer
19:09 - we need to prove to
19:11 - um uh the ceo that it's worth hiring a
19:14 - specific web developer for this problem
19:16 - you know whatever um so there's been a
19:18 - couple things like that where somebody's
19:19 - final project was actually
19:21 - just piecing together in a week
19:24 - something that might work for another
19:25 - company and
19:26 - both times that i saw it
19:28 - they got that job um okay
19:31 - so i think that's a big thing and the
19:32 - other thing is just like
19:33 - lining up
19:35 - kind of like i mentioned before you know
19:36 - what skills are you seeing in these jobs
19:38 - what skills do you want to um
19:40 - investigate and make your portfolio
19:42 - about that um okay at a certain point it
19:45 - starts to make sense you keep seeing the
19:46 - same words over and over again well
19:48 - that's probably the technologies you
19:49 - should use with your projects and then
19:51 - uh like what kind of fun things do you
19:53 - want to build
19:54 - oh okay well it looks like these
19:55 - companies also build those similar
19:57 - things those are the companies that i'll
19:59 - spend all my energy on so just lining up
20:01 - whatever you see similarity in your
20:04 - personality what you want to develop
20:06 - with what jobs are out there
20:08 - okay so don't apply for your dream job
20:10 - first be realistic
20:12 - also build projects that are useful for
20:14 - the companies you're applying for try to
20:15 - build something that seems to be useful
20:17 - for their tech stack i guess what
20:18 - they're doing and then the third one is
20:21 - to just um
20:23 - be i think your
20:24 - uh volume you mentioned it's uh
20:27 - a lot of places definitely that and also
20:30 - and also just trying to so it's volume
20:32 - but like you said it's it's catering
20:35 - to every so even if you apply to 200
20:37 - companies every time you apply for one
20:38 - you have to look at what they're looking
20:39 - for and what the the keywords are and
20:41 - try to cater for that specific one even
20:43 - you have to do it 200 different times
20:44 - right like don't just make one
20:46 - restaurant copy paste send it around
20:48 - that's not going to be has efficient or
20:50 - like has useful i guess do you have you
20:53 - seen anything in your in your experience
20:55 - have you seen any bootcamp graduates or
20:57 - do you know any booking graduates that
20:58 - have this sort of like imposter syndrome
21:00 - where they will go to a job and they
21:02 - will say well you know like compared to
21:04 - the workforce it's kind of like
21:06 - uh these these college graduates with
21:08 - computer science degrees and they know
21:09 - their stuff their master's degrees
21:11 - whatever like all i did was a few weeks
21:13 - of coding like you know like the
21:15 - impostor syndrome is very real for a lot
21:17 - of people to get into tech especially
21:18 - for junior roles so is that something
21:20 - that you see often and like um something
21:23 - that maybe
21:24 - uh any ways that people can sort of like
21:26 - fight back that feeling that they don't
21:28 - belong or like they haven't done enough
21:30 - to to get these jobs
21:32 - yeah it's um it's rampant and and i
21:35 - think the
21:36 - other thing is uh i suffer from the two
21:38 - you know as as the instructor
21:40 - in front of
21:41 - 15 to 20 students who are trying to
21:44 - learn development i'm supposedly the
21:46 - expert but i can't know everything
21:48 - um i think the
21:51 - there's a
21:52 - there's a website i can't remember the
21:53 - name of it but it's like
21:54 - am i a developer.net or something am i a
21:57 - real developer
21:58 - and it just there's like five questions
22:00 - on it and it's like do you
22:02 - uh make web pages like do you code on a
22:05 - daily basis uh
22:07 - are you a chemical that
22:09 - converts photographs into finished
22:11 - images like
22:12 - if you answered yes to any of those
22:13 - questions then you were a developer
22:15 - and i think that's the big thing is
22:17 - focusing on what you've done
22:19 - um as opposed to what you haven't done
22:20 - or what you think people are expecting
22:23 - you to have done
22:25 - those who focus on well there's four
22:27 - projects in the general assembly
22:28 - curriculum and most boot camps are
22:30 - similar you've got a few projects and
22:32 - and you polish those up and then you
22:33 - display them
22:35 - for potential employers
22:37 - and i think that's the biggest thing is
22:38 - to focus on what you've done what you're
22:40 - proud of
22:41 - and then keep doing more you know um
22:44 - okay
22:45 - there's no ideal like oh this is the
22:48 - perfect developer um
22:50 - especially in interviews what people are
22:52 - looking for is like oh well can you make
22:54 - productive code and if you have made
22:56 - productive code that's the best
22:58 - indicator that you will keep doing that
23:00 - i know that uh talking to other guests
23:01 - that we've had they also mentioned
23:05 - that your first job can be a critical
23:09 - piece to to fighting this impossible
23:11 - syndrome where you land at a company
23:13 - where
23:13 - you know your mentor your manager your
23:16 - lead your team lead whoever it is uh
23:18 - they understand that you're a junior
23:19 - developer you got started like they
23:21 - understand that there's limits to what
23:22 - people know and they kind of like take
23:24 - you under the wings and i give you the
23:26 - space to grow and to feel confident and
23:28 - to you know uh feel like the skills that
23:31 - you know you know and you really feel
23:33 - you feel it uh they mentioned that
23:35 - that's also kind of like very important
23:37 - that sometimes people will have bad
23:38 - experiences but they will they're so
23:40 - desperate to land a job anywhere that
23:41 - they would just pick whatever whoever
23:43 - calls back and and then they end up
23:44 - being in places where maybe they
23:46 - they feel like they're inadequate or
23:48 - they didn't know enough or you know
23:50 - there was there wasn't that that spirit
23:52 - of mentorship or
23:53 - or just like okay it's okay it's okay
23:55 - you know just got here give give
23:57 - yourself some time like so do you think
23:58 - that that when you're applying for jobs
24:00 - it's also important to sort of uh just
24:03 - like you said about applying for boot
24:04 - camps you have to find the right one i
24:06 - would imagine that for jobs you also
24:08 - have to sort of
24:09 - fight your instinct of just taking
24:11 - anything you're desperate for finding a
24:12 - job and just try to be a bit more uh
24:15 - picky
24:17 - yeah
24:18 - yeah my my co-instructor
24:20 - had a really good exercise that we would
24:22 - do towards the end of a boot camp um and
24:25 - they were all vaguely based on mostly
24:27 - his experiences he's had some very very
24:29 - interesting experiences um and some of
24:31 - mine but like
24:33 - this is a job you've got very little
24:35 - information coming through an interview
24:37 - um
24:38 - and he he described it as like playing a
24:40 - slot machine and so like okay you got
24:42 - these things coming up and like the
24:44 - cherry comes in a cherry uh cherry oh
24:46 - orange crap that's not what i was
24:48 - looking for um and i think that's true
24:50 - with any job interview you're like oh
24:51 - okay well it pays 100 000 a year that's
24:54 - really great that's what i'm looking for
24:55 - uh it sounds like uh they're using um
24:59 - react that's a it's a good framework i
25:01 - really want to learn that um and uh if
25:05 - if i go there i'm the only person coming
25:07 - into the office and there's nobody else
25:08 - there that really sucks so like that's
25:11 - the
25:11 - um
25:12 - okay like the bomb or whatever came down
25:14 - yeah
25:15 - on the slot machine and so just kind of
25:17 - addressing those those jobs where
25:20 - you go in and do you care about money uh
25:23 - do you care about um
25:25 - being in a culture that feels welcoming
25:28 - um i always uh i always define um what i
25:32 - call a bs matrix like what's the bs that
25:34 - you're you're willing to deal with and
25:37 - that you're not
25:38 - um and so if it's if it's something that
25:41 - uh you don't care about well then you
25:43 - don't care about it right whatever like
25:45 - if you're willing to work for 25 000 a
25:47 - year and you're saving the world
25:50 - then do that definitely do that um
25:53 - if on the other hand
25:55 - you really want the money but you don't
25:57 - really care about um
25:59 - a congenial atmosphere and you kind of
26:01 - want to do things on your own
26:02 - then go in that way um and so just kind
26:05 - of listing out those pros and cons i
26:06 - think is a really really big thing just
26:08 - get get your head around like what is
26:10 - the job i'm looking for
26:11 - but if you're coming out of a boot camp
26:13 - i think like learning has to be in the
26:16 - top three in that list
26:18 - money's great but if you don't have that
26:20 - ability to grow
26:22 - working with somebody who actually cares
26:24 - about your development um as a developer
26:26 - i think that's the that's the most
26:28 - important thing is just finding somebody
26:30 - who can
26:31 - uh sponsor that growth and the rest of
26:33 - it is kind of secondary because once you
26:36 - have that first job the gates just open
26:38 - up so many other people will be looking
26:40 - to hire you um so if it's not the
26:43 - perfect job but it was a great learning
26:44 - experience for a couple years then
26:47 - then you're you're basically done your
26:49 - career from now is wherever you want it
26:51 - to go
26:53 - and do you have any specific advice for
26:55 - when um junior developers might they
26:58 - might find themselves in situations
26:59 - where they are trying to
27:01 - buy more than they can chew sort of so
27:03 - to speak or
27:05 - maybe you're very eager and you come in
27:07 - and say well can you take care of this
27:08 - can you think of that and uh
27:10 - you might end up in places where it's a
27:12 - friday night and you're working you wake
27:14 - up saturday you keep working because you
27:15 - feel like you know it's all great it's
27:17 - awesome i love my job i keep doing it
27:19 - like some days afternoons after what
27:20 - after lunch you're working and um you
27:23 - don't realize that you're burning
27:24 - yourself out until like eight months
27:27 - later you hate your job and you think
27:29 - that development actually said what you
27:30 - thought it was uh do you have any advice
27:32 - for uh junior roles where
27:35 - sometimes eagerness gets the best of you
27:37 - or like the excitement that okay you
27:39 - made it you went through the boot camp
27:40 - you learned it actually worked your
27:42 - resume got through you got a job and you
27:44 - like it uh how do you sort of like rein
27:46 - in that enthusiasm and so like keep it
27:48 - in check so that
27:50 - it works more long term
27:52 - um
27:53 - so i ran cross country and track in high
27:55 - school and and what i'd say like if
27:57 - you're starting a new job
27:59 - um
28:00 - you don't want to run your fastest right
28:03 - away because then you set that
28:04 - expectation
28:05 - same thing in cross-country if you're if
28:07 - you're running a 5k race and you give it
28:10 - your all on the first day well that's
28:11 - going to be your pr and and you're going
28:13 - to have to keep improving every time
28:15 - from that oh my god i was going so so
28:17 - hard that'll lead to burnout for sure if
28:20 - you show up in your first day of work
28:22 - you're already working 12 hours um
28:24 - and then you continue that through well
28:26 - there's only down from
28:29 - you're not there
28:29 - to start working 13 14 15 well now
28:31 - you're not sleeping um that's that's not
28:33 - healthy um so i think it's probably
28:37 - uh if you are working really really hard
28:40 - sometimes just kind of hide that or or
28:43 - to compartmentalize my first couple jobs
28:45 - i would um i would stay after late at
28:48 - work until seven or eight but those last
28:50 - two or three hours of the day were me
28:51 - going through tutorials and learning new
28:53 - things um so that's not going to
28:56 - it's not going to affect my my velocity
28:58 - when i when i check in with my team
29:00 - saying oh i got three bugs fixed today
29:03 - and i got one bug fixed today and
29:04 - they're like what happened to the three
29:06 - bugs fixed uh
29:08 - keep doing that same amount of work um
29:10 - to make sure the company is staying
29:12 - afloat and and you're making good code
29:14 - but you can buffer that if you really do
29:16 - want to
29:17 - go crazy grow with that with that
29:20 - craziness um
29:21 - especially if you're if you're younger i
29:23 - i know this has changed for me certainly
29:26 - now that i'm in my 30s like i don't
29:28 - really want to work 12 hour days anymore
29:30 - and i know that they're not really
29:30 - fulfilling but they used to be like i
29:33 - did actually really enjoy
29:35 - those three hours of tutorials like oh
29:37 - cool now i can make the racer go this
29:39 - way on my new web page this is really
29:41 - exciting
29:42 - um and then you get up and you do it
29:43 - again the next day and it's fine um so
29:46 - again if that's if that's the vs that
29:48 - somebody can tolerate if they can work
29:50 - 12 13 hour days i think it's just like
29:52 - don't go super fast off the gate don't
29:55 - don't go super fast right away um and if
29:58 - you are spending extra time make sure
30:00 - it's also fulfilling for you i guess
30:01 - those are the two big things
30:03 - hey that's fair yeah i like it i'm gonna
30:05 - take that advice too
30:06 - uh thanks so much um before we jump into
30:09 - the q a with the audience do you have
30:11 - any parting thoughts or any general
30:13 - advice that you wanted to share about
30:15 - learning
30:16 - self teaching yourself code going to
30:17 - boot camps landing jobs at the boot
30:19 - camps
30:21 - uh yeah i think
30:23 - um
30:24 - i have this i have this pet peeve and it
30:26 - started as a um as a math major and then
30:29 - i started substitute teaching
30:32 - and just hearing over and over again
30:33 - like i can't do math or i'm so bad at
30:35 - math uh and and when you're talking to
30:37 - an eight-year-old and that's what they
30:39 - say like i'm i'm so bad at math and like
30:41 - you don't even know what math is yet
30:42 - like you haven't started learning
30:44 - calculus and physics and chemistry all
30:46 - these other things that you could do
30:47 - with math that you've given up here
30:49 - before you've got gotten started
30:51 - um i think the the big thing that i i
30:53 - would stress towards people who are
30:55 - trying to do a career change or trying
30:56 - to get into a new field is like there's
30:58 - no such thing as can't
31:00 - but there is such a thing as like oh i
31:02 - have these skills and they're much
31:03 - easier for me um than
31:05 - somebody else maybe
31:07 - and so to lean on those skills
31:09 - without that idea of like oh i can't do
31:11 - this thing
31:12 - um it might be harder ask yourself the
31:14 - question well how much time will it take
31:16 - to get to the level that you want to be
31:18 - rather than like oh is this the right
31:21 - field for me it's never that black and
31:22 - white um but i think that's the big
31:24 - thing is
31:25 - focusing on
31:27 - everything is possible
31:29 - but is it going to take four years for
31:30 - you to get to where you want to go
31:32 - um so listen listen to
31:36 - whatever fate has placed in your way
31:38 - whatever jobs have been placed in your
31:40 - way like oh well this is feeling this is
31:43 - feeling smoother
31:44 - but but never accept that idea that like
31:46 - can't is a thing you can always do
31:49 - something if you want to
31:50 - i think i heard somebody say um
31:53 - we're all different and we learn at
31:54 - different rates
31:56 - and
31:57 - oftentimes what happened what happens
31:59 - with this standardized education system
32:00 - that we have where classrooms are you
32:02 - know 50 minutes for everybody and the
32:05 - book is the same thickness for everybody
32:07 - and you know the exams are the same for
32:09 - everybody it's like it ignores that part
32:11 - that everybody is a little different the
32:12 - way that they learn store concepts
32:14 - and you end up if you don't fit that
32:16 - shoe basically you might be bad at math
32:18 - but really what happened is that you
32:20 - needed like a couple of extra exercises
32:22 - to practice with before you clicked
32:24 - maybe what you needed is like three more
32:26 - examples maybe you just needed two more
32:28 - hours of reading the material but you
32:30 - just weren't given that choice because
32:31 - there's like this standard one one
32:34 - uh size fits all and if you are unlucky
32:37 - not to fit within that range then you
32:39 - just you go around saying well math is
32:42 - not for me
32:43 - um so i know that
32:44 - i've heard in the past i would say you
32:46 - know yeah if you need to read it two
32:48 - times until one time what yeah sucks
32:50 - people that read it once and keep stay
32:52 - with it yeah they
32:53 - they they got it and they walk away but
32:55 - you you can read it twice it was going
32:56 - to take some more time but you can get
32:58 - there too
32:59 - so um i know that that's a that's a big
33:01 - one for learners at code academy it's
33:02 - like do i need math to codes like yes
33:04 - and no but don't worry about it because
33:07 - you can learn it like even if you don't
33:09 - like if the your question is not do i
33:11 - need math the question is can i learn
33:13 - the math i need
33:14 - and yes you can
33:16 - yeah right yep
33:17 - okay
33:18 - awesome so um i don't know if we have
33:20 - any questions from the audience let me
33:22 - check in the chat um
33:26 - someone asked at the very uh towards the
33:28 - beginning they said
33:33 - oh they were asking about learning
33:34 - python yeah there's a lot of resources
33:36 - online learning python code academy is
33:37 - one and there's many many others
33:40 - do you have do you have any like
33:42 - favorite resources online for practicing
33:44 - python for example is there any i know
33:46 - like kaggle for example for data sets
33:48 - and stuff
33:49 - um
33:50 - what do you do if you want to practice
33:51 - python
33:52 - um yeah i guess it's been a while uh
33:55 - i think the last time i i was doing i
33:57 - was probably doing it on on codecademy
33:59 - um
34:00 - and
34:01 - and there are definitely other other
34:03 - tutorials out there um i think the
34:05 - biggest thing is like if you want to
34:06 - focus on on data
34:08 - probably want to go towards something
34:10 - that'll that'll teach you pandas or some
34:12 - other like data visualization
34:14 - um
34:15 - library uh
34:17 - i think that's that's the only
34:19 - kind of recommendation i have
34:21 - um
34:22 - and then just the general recommendation
34:24 - which is do something that would be fun
34:25 - for you so if you're looking to make a
34:26 - game with python you'll find a tutorial
34:28 - that does that
34:29 - if you're looking for
34:32 - more functional programming paradigms or
34:34 - whatever you'll find a course that
34:36 - that'll that'll teach you that python's
34:38 - a
34:38 - it's a language it's a way to code
34:41 - um but the question is really what do
34:42 - you want to do with it and i think uh a
34:44 - lot of people forget that when you're
34:45 - looking for a class or tutorial nice all
34:48 - right so be uh
34:50 - kind of like uh
34:52 - project oriented with it uh sort of like
34:54 - you learn english now what novel are you
34:56 - gonna write right like you know the
34:58 - language what's the book you're gonna
35:00 - write what is the essay yeah you know
35:02 - the words now put them together i guess
35:03 - sort of a situation well um i realized
35:07 - that we're going a little over time so
35:08 - uh thank you so much for your time i
35:11 - think you have awesome advice today and
35:13 - i'm sure that a lot of people are
35:14 - learning a lot from your advice uh
35:18 - i'll love to have you back in the future
35:20 - if you want to i'll be around
35:23 - so thank you so much and i'll see you
35:26 - all in our next episode of live
35:28 - conversations
35:29 - thanks betty
35:31 - no problem
35:33 - and that's it

Cleaned transcript:

go live okay well we're live thank you zep for stopping by today i think i want to start by asking you the basic questions if you can introduce yourself tell me you know a little bit about your background and what you do true um so i'm gerard i work at codecademy on the content platform team so basically we're responsible for all the stuff that gets submitted to codecademy so many quizzes articles uh lessons things like that um so that's what i do currently before that i was teaching at a boot camp called general assembly about a couple other odd tech jobs um here in the states but before that i was teaching english in taiwan wow wait so you go from english teaching english to teaching at a boat camp okay that's that's a bit of a gap uh how did that happen yeah i i guess i described it as like uh if you sail at all like when you're sailing you're supposed to attack which means like you go uh kind of towards the wind to the right and then to the left and to the right and to the left so that way you're not facing directly into the wind so it's kind of the same thing like my my parents uh were both teachers and i was i know i don't want to be like my parents let me go get a math degree and then uh i graduated in 2009 which wasn't a great time for getting jobs so my way to to find some meaningful work was to go abroad to taiwan and teach english and then doing that for two and a half years i started to miss technology so i came back to the states and worked at a software company called netbrain and then another one called in bravada and then i was feeling the other problem which is well now i miss teaching because i'm doing all this technology work so luckily at codecademy those things have kind of come together nice so coding teaching teaching coding yeah i mean do you was there any point where you thought well i guess since it's going to end up being a college professor or something like computer science like what's that kind of like what's that point in your life where you're like i want to teach and i like code this seems to be the only possible way yeah i i think again probably the main reason that that didn't happen was uh graduating university in 2009 meant that that's what all my other friends were doing and i think it seems like there is a pretty large amount of people who are going back to school and getting a second degree because the job market's still not where it should be um and i just didn't i didn't want to be part of that mass of people going to get a doctorate or a law degree okay i mean fair i guess just sometimes yeah it's just uh it's not where you see yourself and it's better not to try again so you try new things i mean it takes some some guts you know to uh go in a different direction like everybody else like you probably thinking maybe i made a mistake maybe maybe this group of people had it right and i should have seems like it worked out certainly in the beginning yeah i mean because i uh graduated college and i i could get by with spanish and i could speak english or looking at you know places to teach english in latin america instead and the jobs just weren't there um the school year was the opposite so they ended up going to taiwan red didn't speak any chinese at all so it's definitely a big culture shock to just get kind of thrown in there um yeah they're definitely in the first couple months regretting that uh decision i was a little bit scary but uh towards the end that i wouldn't trade it for the world nice that's awesome you um did you always see yourself once you were going to the coding down the coding path the technology that you use nowadays do you start with those or was it more like an exploration of trying different programming languages and different uh fields and then sort of like realizing which one interested you the most yeah there's certainly a lot of exploration i think i made a lot of i guess mistakes in the beginning just trying to figure it out on my own and i while i had friends who were coders i don't know that i had a mentor so i was just kind of like trying whatever would work um and then you know i'll make a i'll make a game in python i think one thing that i made was like a pizza falling towards the hungry character like okay cool i guess i did that pizza's falling eating right then you get 100 points and you win um and then it kind of pivoted towards web development for i think a couple reasons the first one is it's just so easy to see what's happening in web development you save something refresh the page and oh cool it's blue now right and then on top of that exactly exactly whereas if you're kind of more heavy um like python java things like this like you can make a chess game but it's not as obvious like how you would make those chess pieces show up um they immediately show up in my development um in general assembly um i was lucky enough that the general assembly had started uh their new office in denver just when i moved out there and that's the first the first course they always have is the web development course so that kind of pushed me even further in that direction i think that that's a very common theme with a lot of learners at code academy is that when they start to learn something like python or even web development at the beginning at the beginning it's very dry you learn html you learn css it's a very vanilla you don't really you see the big websites from big companies and all this and the social media places you are in and they're so sophisticated and a lot of people want to get there quickly and it's it's not always it's not very obvious the amount of learning you have to do or how much of it or it can be it can be a little bit of a hurdle to it for people to to visualize where they're trying to go and stay with it so that's why i was curious to know how you got into web development because uh you know a lot of people say well i started with this i did a bit of html javascript but it got boring or like you know by the time i got to the react part i was just like not interested anymore um did you when you were learning did you do anything to stay motivated like finding online communities or having any sort of like people to talk to or were you just like selfdriven do you have any any advice on that um i think the biggest thing that i found is is trying to find the skill uh that that you see in demand either in your workplace or or in a position that you want to apply for and something that that you want to do so if somebody's trying to get into web development and they're like oh well react in angular those are two different frameworks i'm not sure which one i should choose but you're seeing a lot more job opportunities for react well then you have a reason to do it not just to grow but also uh this this can keep me growing if i'm going to find a job where i can do it 40 hours a week it'll it'll put a little more i don't know jet fuel behind you so you don't have to just be selfdriven and rely on yourself i think the that's one big thing um the other big thing that um when you were saying like how uh how did i end up in web development i think a lot of that was hackathon driven to be honest you know just going out and meeting people and building random stuff and that i think kind of informed uh well i want to make this fun hobby project with a couple other people um and that's that'll keep me going too you know another couple months working on this project that i really like what technology do we all decide on oh cool that's the one that i'm learning on codecademy right now or something like that that's cool it's um i think the hackathons help a lot for people that are very um sort of like results oriented and i know that you touched on how you went to web development because you can immediately see you can refresh the page your change is there um and i know that that helps a lot of people stay motivated is that when they build something and they see what the impact of it is and with hackathons that's sort of like the end point right like the point of a hackathon is you build something at the end so it really drives people to stay with it um i know that there's a bit of a drop off when people are learning and towards the middle where maybe it gets a little more dry or a bit more theoretical in in things with framework something is there um did you find anything in particular to be challenging or something that you say well i'm just gonna have to remind myself why i'm here or why i'm trying to do this or i mean i don't know if there's any shortcuts in learning some of this stuff like you just just gotta memorize it i guess um well i think the good thing uh the good thing about millennials get a bad rap right because uh we're so dependent on technology um but that's exactly what makes someone a successful developer is you don't need to know everything um but if you know where you're going to look to find it um then you don't you don't need to memorize all those things um and so i think that's the that's that's one thing that that really helps when things are getting um super dry like do i really need to study this well no if i have a couple links that i can go back to that's that's enough let's move on to the next thing let's move on to something that's a little more fun um i think that's a that's a big part of it um yeah okay yeah so i guess uh it's sort of like you it's okay to it's okay to just be scrappy with some of what you know if you if at least you know where to look for it later when you need it it's sort of like write it write it has a note like this is important and then maybe later when you're building something you need it and at least you know the sources of where to look and finish learning it or um yeah because i feel like sometimes when people are learning to code they see it as a very linear path and and that might be our fault too because of the way we present curriculum is like here's the star line and here's the end line but like you said a lot of times the way that you learn things and the way you end up in places uh you might you might be learning javascript and then maybe all of a sudden you're interested in the back end and you have eric curious about hollow by canelo you can back go that way then come back later finish the the end of the front end um so that that's a really good point about not being too linear in the way that you learn things and just kind of like go with the flow a bit um i'm curious um when you mentioned earlier the boot camp did you spend a lot of time trying to decide on a boot camp because a lot of our learners at code academy they're they're in that same spot they're thinking okay there's like 10 15 bootcamps in new york which one is the best which one is the one that's gonna get me a job um do you have to spend a lot of time thinking about that um well luckily for me there are really only the two options at the time um in in colorado that we're hiring there was there was galvanize in general assembly um and general assembly was was new enough that they they were trying to hire really aggressively um i think as far as as far as choosing which boot camp to go to as a as a student i think i can't overstate just how important having a good instructional team is and so often you know people try to make uh comparisons about oh well this company is better let's go to flatiron school let's go to general assembly um but there's so much to be said for the the people that are actually delivering um that curriculum and i think what i'd recommend to everyone it's kind of what i would recommend if you're job searching too is to have kind of a comparison attitude you should be looking at a few different schools and you should be interviewing them as well as they're interviewing you um see if you like the the people that are giving these courses and usually i know this is true for general assembly and galvanized um usually those teachers um that are actually teaching the fulltime boot camps or the parttime courses they'll do kind of oneoff either promotional lessons where they're just like okay let's teach you the very very basics of html and javascript like let's get a website that says hi you know that sort of thing um or they have open houses i've been studying here in new york i've been to i've been to a couple of those uh i found them on meetup.com i got just browsing around like oh uh this one bootcamp is doing some uh some like three hour workshop free workshop on a friday and like i would stop by and stuff and yeah it's like you said they showcase some of it like look at look at our offices and look at the desk and like here's what you would study and they try to really make it all like very cozy uh trying to tell you hey you know next cohorts next month yep yeah that's that's the big thing i would say is is look for the people like does it feel good when when you're being interviewed does does it feel natural when you see one of those instructors actually teaching and then and then choose that uh whatever feels right as far as the instructional experience you'll get does it matter the background that you have and i mean there since there's so many choices with boot camps especially if you're in a big city does it matter for example um how you choose a bootcamp depends on if you already have like this computer science college degrees that come out and they get a bookcon to be job ready versus someone that's totally new for to tech or someone that might have some experience with online courses that's does where you come from make an impact in the kind of bootcamp that you like i mean that you that will work for you or is it just always comes down to the people like you said um i think it does or at least there's an intent there uh i know that um the the galvanized approach was um let's let's get you into a parttime course or something that's a little bit easier so we can engage if you're ready if not let's give you another parttime course and then you'll be ready to start um as a way to try to differentiate learning levels um and i think i think turing does something similar um i can't really speak to other ones because those are the only three that i've ever worked with but um i think that it matters um but it doesn't necessarily matter in the way that people might think like uh i think the the most important thing is that those who have a background in something that's not necessarily development or engineering um they might have a lot of translatable skills to development um the the thing that comes up for me a lot but most people might not think of is like professional weight lifters or like people who are personal trainers um they're remarkably in my experience they're remarkably adept at switching that set of skills to learning how to code 12 13 hours a day because my thought and what some of them said to me is like well that's what we do you know we're working out every day you know several hours a day and we know if we don't hit whatever goal we're trying to set we need to come into the gym early tomorrow and do it again um and so that that i think really feeds into it well um as well but yeah i think definitely experience matters um i mean i was asking because um i was asking because i wonder i'm assuming that the basics of like if you want to be a web developer i would imagine that the curriculum in every bootcamp is like basically very similar and the way that you might decide like okay if you come from a background where you already know some tech or you're already adept at certain skills you might be looking for a bootcamp that goes a bit more fastpaced a bit more project oriented and like i'm assuming that other bootcamps might cover the material over a longer period of time or they might have more support systems in place or more peer reviews or whatever it is um i would imagine that those are all factors that that play into this bootcamp is right for me or that book comes right for me yeah and uh so the last course i taught at general assembly was called sei flex of software engineering immersive flex and that catered to a little bit more folks who are in development but not quite in web development or trying to make a little bit of a career change or just polishing up skills um and i and and those those offerings exist at other boot camps as well um so i think that's that's probably the big thing like do you want to keep your job or at least keep a parttime role while you're going to a boot camp and there are courses specifically for that i don't know if it's like company specific but um there are certainly core specific things and then my my wife also taught uh a react specific not really boot camp but it was i think three days a week for three hours on react so if you feel like you need to you just need those react frontend skills and you feel pretty confident in other things there's usually an offering that will fit into that specific niche okay all right so let's say that i chose my boot camp i'm going to it it's going to be hell it's like 10 hours a day of studying and then i have to do homework for the next day it's going you know it's all kinds of crazy um once you get towards the end of the boot camp and you're starting to think okay i got like two weeks left i should be thinking about what i'm gonna do with this how i'm gonna apply what i'm gonna do how do you leverage what you've learned at bootcamp or like how do you play it to the best uh in the best light so that you do get to the point where you land a job or something like how how do you use boot camps and what you've learned to make that that jump is there like a trick to it or it's just luck there's a few things that i've seen that work really well i think a lot of it is luck a lot of us luck in volume you know the biggest thing is uh like i said before applying to a bunch of places and and often so the first thing is try not to apply to your dream job first because you're unlikely to get that job right away you've got to go at an interview make sure your portfolio is polished um so it's it's not necessarily the most ethical thing i guess but like to go after a job that you're like if i get it i get it if i don't i don't um do that first so you can kind of shake out those nerves i think that's a big thing another big thing that i've seen people do which is really cool is actually work for that company like their final project is a proof of concept which is basically a longform interview for the company they want to work for like we have this problem uh we can't organize the lawn equipment for our landscaping company and we want a website developer we need to prove to um uh the ceo that it's worth hiring a specific web developer for this problem you know whatever um so there's been a couple things like that where somebody's final project was actually just piecing together in a week something that might work for another company and both times that i saw it they got that job um okay so i think that's a big thing and the other thing is just like lining up kind of like i mentioned before you know what skills are you seeing in these jobs what skills do you want to um investigate and make your portfolio about that um okay at a certain point it starts to make sense you keep seeing the same words over and over again well that's probably the technologies you should use with your projects and then uh like what kind of fun things do you want to build oh okay well it looks like these companies also build those similar things those are the companies that i'll spend all my energy on so just lining up whatever you see similarity in your personality what you want to develop with what jobs are out there okay so don't apply for your dream job first be realistic also build projects that are useful for the companies you're applying for try to build something that seems to be useful for their tech stack i guess what they're doing and then the third one is to just um be i think your uh volume you mentioned it's uh a lot of places definitely that and also and also just trying to so it's volume but like you said it's it's catering to every so even if you apply to 200 companies every time you apply for one you have to look at what they're looking for and what the the keywords are and try to cater for that specific one even you have to do it 200 different times right like don't just make one restaurant copy paste send it around that's not going to be has efficient or like has useful i guess do you have you seen anything in your in your experience have you seen any bootcamp graduates or do you know any booking graduates that have this sort of like imposter syndrome where they will go to a job and they will say well you know like compared to the workforce it's kind of like uh these these college graduates with computer science degrees and they know their stuff their master's degrees whatever like all i did was a few weeks of coding like you know like the impostor syndrome is very real for a lot of people to get into tech especially for junior roles so is that something that you see often and like um something that maybe uh any ways that people can sort of like fight back that feeling that they don't belong or like they haven't done enough to to get these jobs yeah it's um it's rampant and and i think the other thing is uh i suffer from the two you know as as the instructor in front of 15 to 20 students who are trying to learn development i'm supposedly the expert but i can't know everything um i think the there's a there's a website i can't remember the name of it but it's like am i a developer.net or something am i a real developer and it just there's like five questions on it and it's like do you uh make web pages like do you code on a daily basis uh are you a chemical that converts photographs into finished images like if you answered yes to any of those questions then you were a developer and i think that's the big thing is focusing on what you've done um as opposed to what you haven't done or what you think people are expecting you to have done those who focus on well there's four projects in the general assembly curriculum and most boot camps are similar you've got a few projects and and you polish those up and then you display them for potential employers and i think that's the biggest thing is to focus on what you've done what you're proud of and then keep doing more you know um okay there's no ideal like oh this is the perfect developer um especially in interviews what people are looking for is like oh well can you make productive code and if you have made productive code that's the best indicator that you will keep doing that i know that uh talking to other guests that we've had they also mentioned that your first job can be a critical piece to to fighting this impossible syndrome where you land at a company where you know your mentor your manager your lead your team lead whoever it is uh they understand that you're a junior developer you got started like they understand that there's limits to what people know and they kind of like take you under the wings and i give you the space to grow and to feel confident and to you know uh feel like the skills that you know you know and you really feel you feel it uh they mentioned that that's also kind of like very important that sometimes people will have bad experiences but they will they're so desperate to land a job anywhere that they would just pick whatever whoever calls back and and then they end up being in places where maybe they they feel like they're inadequate or they didn't know enough or you know there was there wasn't that that spirit of mentorship or or just like okay it's okay it's okay you know just got here give give yourself some time like so do you think that that when you're applying for jobs it's also important to sort of uh just like you said about applying for boot camps you have to find the right one i would imagine that for jobs you also have to sort of fight your instinct of just taking anything you're desperate for finding a job and just try to be a bit more uh picky yeah yeah my my coinstructor had a really good exercise that we would do towards the end of a boot camp um and they were all vaguely based on mostly his experiences he's had some very very interesting experiences um and some of mine but like this is a job you've got very little information coming through an interview um and he he described it as like playing a slot machine and so like okay you got these things coming up and like the cherry comes in a cherry uh cherry oh orange crap that's not what i was looking for um and i think that's true with any job interview you're like oh okay well it pays 100 000 a year that's really great that's what i'm looking for uh it sounds like uh they're using um react that's a it's a good framework i really want to learn that um and uh if if i go there i'm the only person coming into the office and there's nobody else there that really sucks so like that's the um okay like the bomb or whatever came down yeah on the slot machine and so just kind of addressing those those jobs where you go in and do you care about money uh do you care about um being in a culture that feels welcoming um i always uh i always define um what i call a bs matrix like what's the bs that you're you're willing to deal with and that you're not um and so if it's if it's something that uh you don't care about well then you don't care about it right whatever like if you're willing to work for 25 000 a year and you're saving the world then do that definitely do that um if on the other hand you really want the money but you don't really care about um a congenial atmosphere and you kind of want to do things on your own then go in that way um and so just kind of listing out those pros and cons i think is a really really big thing just get get your head around like what is the job i'm looking for but if you're coming out of a boot camp i think like learning has to be in the top three in that list money's great but if you don't have that ability to grow working with somebody who actually cares about your development um as a developer i think that's the that's the most important thing is just finding somebody who can uh sponsor that growth and the rest of it is kind of secondary because once you have that first job the gates just open up so many other people will be looking to hire you um so if it's not the perfect job but it was a great learning experience for a couple years then then you're you're basically done your career from now is wherever you want it to go and do you have any specific advice for when um junior developers might they might find themselves in situations where they are trying to buy more than they can chew sort of so to speak or maybe you're very eager and you come in and say well can you take care of this can you think of that and uh you might end up in places where it's a friday night and you're working you wake up saturday you keep working because you feel like you know it's all great it's awesome i love my job i keep doing it like some days afternoons after what after lunch you're working and um you don't realize that you're burning yourself out until like eight months later you hate your job and you think that development actually said what you thought it was uh do you have any advice for uh junior roles where sometimes eagerness gets the best of you or like the excitement that okay you made it you went through the boot camp you learned it actually worked your resume got through you got a job and you like it uh how do you sort of like rein in that enthusiasm and so like keep it in check so that it works more long term um so i ran cross country and track in high school and and what i'd say like if you're starting a new job um you don't want to run your fastest right away because then you set that expectation same thing in crosscountry if you're if you're running a 5k race and you give it your all on the first day well that's going to be your pr and and you're going to have to keep improving every time from that oh my god i was going so so hard that'll lead to burnout for sure if you show up in your first day of work you're already working 12 hours um and then you continue that through well there's only down from you're not there to start working 13 14 15 well now you're not sleeping um that's that's not healthy um so i think it's probably uh if you are working really really hard sometimes just kind of hide that or or to compartmentalize my first couple jobs i would um i would stay after late at work until seven or eight but those last two or three hours of the day were me going through tutorials and learning new things um so that's not going to it's not going to affect my my velocity when i when i check in with my team saying oh i got three bugs fixed today and i got one bug fixed today and they're like what happened to the three bugs fixed uh keep doing that same amount of work um to make sure the company is staying afloat and and you're making good code but you can buffer that if you really do want to go crazy grow with that with that craziness um especially if you're if you're younger i i know this has changed for me certainly now that i'm in my 30s like i don't really want to work 12 hour days anymore and i know that they're not really fulfilling but they used to be like i did actually really enjoy those three hours of tutorials like oh cool now i can make the racer go this way on my new web page this is really exciting um and then you get up and you do it again the next day and it's fine um so again if that's if that's the vs that somebody can tolerate if they can work 12 13 hour days i think it's just like don't go super fast off the gate don't don't go super fast right away um and if you are spending extra time make sure it's also fulfilling for you i guess those are the two big things hey that's fair yeah i like it i'm gonna take that advice too uh thanks so much um before we jump into the q a with the audience do you have any parting thoughts or any general advice that you wanted to share about learning self teaching yourself code going to boot camps landing jobs at the boot camps uh yeah i think um i have this i have this pet peeve and it started as a um as a math major and then i started substitute teaching and just hearing over and over again like i can't do math or i'm so bad at math uh and and when you're talking to an eightyearold and that's what they say like i'm i'm so bad at math and like you don't even know what math is yet like you haven't started learning calculus and physics and chemistry all these other things that you could do with math that you've given up here before you've got gotten started um i think the the big thing that i i would stress towards people who are trying to do a career change or trying to get into a new field is like there's no such thing as can't but there is such a thing as like oh i have these skills and they're much easier for me um than somebody else maybe and so to lean on those skills without that idea of like oh i can't do this thing um it might be harder ask yourself the question well how much time will it take to get to the level that you want to be rather than like oh is this the right field for me it's never that black and white um but i think that's the big thing is focusing on everything is possible but is it going to take four years for you to get to where you want to go um so listen listen to whatever fate has placed in your way whatever jobs have been placed in your way like oh well this is feeling this is feeling smoother but but never accept that idea that like can't is a thing you can always do something if you want to i think i heard somebody say um we're all different and we learn at different rates and oftentimes what happened what happens with this standardized education system that we have where classrooms are you know 50 minutes for everybody and the book is the same thickness for everybody and you know the exams are the same for everybody it's like it ignores that part that everybody is a little different the way that they learn store concepts and you end up if you don't fit that shoe basically you might be bad at math but really what happened is that you needed like a couple of extra exercises to practice with before you clicked maybe what you needed is like three more examples maybe you just needed two more hours of reading the material but you just weren't given that choice because there's like this standard one one uh size fits all and if you are unlucky not to fit within that range then you just you go around saying well math is not for me um so i know that i've heard in the past i would say you know yeah if you need to read it two times until one time what yeah sucks people that read it once and keep stay with it yeah they they they got it and they walk away but you you can read it twice it was going to take some more time but you can get there too so um i know that that's a that's a big one for learners at code academy it's like do i need math to codes like yes and no but don't worry about it because you can learn it like even if you don't like if the your question is not do i need math the question is can i learn the math i need and yes you can yeah right yep okay awesome so um i don't know if we have any questions from the audience let me check in the chat um someone asked at the very uh towards the beginning they said oh they were asking about learning python yeah there's a lot of resources online learning python code academy is one and there's many many others do you have do you have any like favorite resources online for practicing python for example is there any i know like kaggle for example for data sets and stuff um what do you do if you want to practice python um yeah i guess it's been a while uh i think the last time i i was doing i was probably doing it on on codecademy um and and there are definitely other other tutorials out there um i think the biggest thing is like if you want to focus on on data probably want to go towards something that'll that'll teach you pandas or some other like data visualization um library uh i think that's that's the only kind of recommendation i have um and then just the general recommendation which is do something that would be fun for you so if you're looking to make a game with python you'll find a tutorial that does that if you're looking for more functional programming paradigms or whatever you'll find a course that that'll that'll teach you that python's a it's a language it's a way to code um but the question is really what do you want to do with it and i think uh a lot of people forget that when you're looking for a class or tutorial nice all right so be uh kind of like uh project oriented with it uh sort of like you learn english now what novel are you gonna write right like you know the language what's the book you're gonna write what is the essay yeah you know the words now put them together i guess sort of a situation well um i realized that we're going a little over time so uh thank you so much for your time i think you have awesome advice today and i'm sure that a lot of people are learning a lot from your advice uh i'll love to have you back in the future if you want to i'll be around so thank you so much and i'll see you all in our next episode of live conversations thanks betty no problem and that's it
