02:50 - little bit of our agenda today what
02:52 - we're gonna build out as you can see if
02:54 - you're on the YouTube sorry code Academy
02:56 - site you can see a little example of
03:00 - what we're gonna be building out nothing
03:04 - too flashy but it's gonna have some cool
03:06 - little things that you might not have
03:07 - known before I'm also hoping to learn a
03:09 - little bit from you guys today about
03:11 - maybe some things you know and bootstrap
03:13 - that I don't I'd be super cool well oh
03:16 - welcome for your first time here Raj and
03:20 - beer
03:20 - Raj I hope I said that right okay with
03:27 - everyone down acquainted hope you guys
03:30 - are comfortable at home I think we're
03:32 - gonna get started then okay got it right
03:35 - the first time
03:36 - sorry alright so today we're gonna be
03:40 - learning about bootstrap 4 and so
03:42 - bootstrap 4 is a front-end framework now
03:46 - when we talk about front-end we're
03:48 - talking about the display that you're
03:50 - seeing on a website compare it's like a
03:52 - back-end where that's where you would
03:54 - see the logic that takes care of the the
03:58 - stuff that goes on in the front end and
04:01 - so when we talk and then when you hear
04:03 - things like full stack it incorporates
04:05 - both front-end and back-end now I also
04:08 - mentioned that it's a framework meaning
04:10 - that someone or a team of people have
04:13 - already written this code for you so
04:15 - that you can use in your project and you
04:17 - don't have to rewrite everything from
04:19 - scratch because that really defeats the
04:21 - purpose of this right like if we're
04:22 - trying to style a website why don't we
04:24 - jump straight to just writing our own
04:25 - see
04:26 - which is the cascading stylesheets you'd
04:28 - normally see on a website to make it
04:31 - look nicer
04:32 - okay now bootstrap is really great is
04:38 - because it allows us to create like
04:40 - responsive sites if you've seen the term
04:42 - responsive before it just means that
04:45 - it's it changes the layout of your site
04:48 - to accommodate different screen sizes so
04:51 - whether you're on mobile or you're on a
04:53 - desktop
04:55 - despite the screen differences you'll
04:57 - still get a pleasurable browsing
04:59 - experience so let's say let's if we take
05:02 - a look on the site behind me right now
05:04 - that's let's say a small screen and if
05:07 - we expand it you'll notice that things
05:10 - the layout of it changes ever so
05:12 - slightly but it's still like the same
05:14 - sort of material same elements there
05:17 - okay the goal of today's live stream is
05:22 - not gonna be to just make exactly this I
05:26 - want you to guys feel comfortable with
05:29 - using bootstrap so we are gonna be
05:31 - looking through documentation today I
05:33 - know that's like a scary word sometimes
05:34 - at first but bootstrap off like has
05:37 - great documentation it has great
05:39 - examples and the way I use it and I hope
05:42 - a lot of other people are using it or
05:43 - just grabbing examples so we're gonna
05:45 - take examples directly from the
05:46 - documentation and we're gonna make it
05:48 - into our own little code let's see I'm
05:54 - glad you guys have all said those highs
05:56 - I hope you guys are gonna feel
05:57 - comfortable asking questions as well I
05:59 - love to hear you guys about that and I
06:02 - already saw a suggestion about the
06:04 - carousel example making clickable
06:06 - carousel images that's gonna be this
06:10 - little tidbit right here for those who
06:11 - don't know a carousel is like the
06:13 - slideshow of images and you can click
06:16 - through that so if we don't get through
06:19 - all of it or if you guys get lost at any
06:21 - point too if you click on this folder
06:25 - icon you'll see another folder called
06:27 - steps and I'm gonna stop at each point
06:30 - and you guys if you get lost you can
06:32 - check out what code we have so far and
06:35 - some of the comments that are in there
06:37 - so that you can jump back into
06:39 - the code along okay currently I have the
06:42 - final final page set up right here on
06:49 - the right but I'm gonna remove that and
06:52 - we're gonna go to our blank page which
06:55 - you guys should all have okay let's take
07:00 - a brief pause right here are there any
07:02 - questions before we start where any
07:03 - problems with connecting wait for a few
07:07 - seconds in the chat if not I just really
07:11 - have to assume that we're all good and
07:12 - dandy alright let's go let's do it
07:22 - alright so first things first I'm gonna
07:26 - need the documentation so let's look it
07:28 - up everything seems okay let's go so
07:32 - we're looking for a bootstrap and I'm
07:34 - just going to Google bootstrap and look
07:37 - it's the first result that pops up
07:39 - alright so for us we want to get started
07:43 - because that's what you guys are asking
07:45 - for in the live stream and that's
07:47 - exactly what we're going to do so it has
07:49 - a little bit of information for us like
07:51 - an introduction a QuickStart if we just
07:54 - want the CSS we can take this link right
07:57 - here copy to clipboard bootstrap also
08:01 - offers some JavaScript files which
08:03 - allows us to add more interactivity so
08:06 - like that carousel component that we had
08:08 - that we were able to click through that
08:10 - was because we have JavaScript in there
08:12 - and they had some like other libraries
08:15 - like jQuery and popper here for us and
08:18 - if I scroll down a little further
08:20 - because I know I've gotten acquainted
08:22 - with this there's actually a starter
08:23 - template so for all you guys coding
08:26 - along at home just copy it click the
08:28 - copy button or you can manually click
08:30 - through everything and select it but I'm
08:31 - gonna be lazy and click the copy I'm
08:34 - going to just paste it right over I'm
08:39 - just gonna refresh that real quick okay
08:41 - so notice that we have the title hello
08:45 - world and our body elements let's see we
08:50 - have going to make this also
08:52 - bigger so you guys can see what I'm
08:54 - coding along with we have a title hello
08:58 - world we also have in our header hello
09:00 - world but I don't think our title is
09:03 - gonna be a hello world let's do
09:05 - something like bootstrap livestream
09:08 - that's not gonna show up and we don't
09:12 - really need this hello world's text
09:16 - either so I'm going to clear that out
09:18 - and currently we're gonna have a blank
09:21 - page and that's the end of our first
09:23 - step we've incorporated bootstrap into
09:25 - our projects thumbs up for you guys
09:29 - we're just gonna keep on going from here
09:31 - I will also look over chat as I said I'm
09:35 - gonna stop along every point and this is
09:37 - the end of our step 1 if there's any
09:39 - questions feel free to ask ok I know
09:45 - because I've kind of worked on this that
09:48 - the next step is going to be making or
09:52 - adding really a navigation bar and so
09:56 - the navigation bar in our lesson we talk
10:01 - about components utilities and the grid
10:05 - system and a and it sounds like the
10:09 - navbar is a component because it's it's
10:11 - an element that is that has some sort of
10:14 - default styling and it has a function
10:17 - for us right so the navbar is going to
10:20 - be found in this components tab and
10:24 - we'll just have to locate where the
10:27 - navbar is so then for the navbar
10:31 - documentation and examples for
10:33 - bootstraps powerful responsive meaning
10:35 - that it's gonna change its layout
10:36 - depending on screen size navigation
10:38 - header the nav bar and it also has
10:41 - ironically well an example of it at the
10:44 - very top and so you can read through
10:47 - about how it works but let's just jump
10:50 - right into it and ooh this example looks
10:54 - pretty close to what we need right so
10:57 - again I'm just gonna copy the code and
10:59 - I'm going to place it right in
11:03 - and that looks good to me there is a
11:08 - little bit of spacing issues indent
11:12 - issues so I'm going to edit that's I'm
11:19 - just gonna select everything and press
11:22 - tab once and that should clear it for us
11:25 - let's enter it say you to run the code
11:29 - you're gonna click Save or press command
11:31 - enter or control enter command enter for
11:33 - those on Macs control enter
11:35 - for those on PC I usually asked what's a
11:39 - bootstrap and bootstrap is the framework
11:43 - that we're gonna be working with today
11:44 - to style our HTML pages okay let's see
11:48 - so right now we have awesome we have the
11:53 - actual navbar located there for us and
11:55 - we have something called a sandwich menu
11:59 - or a hamburger menu that when you click
12:01 - on it it has all the different links
12:04 - okay so this is great for us we actually
12:11 - want to change a few things so right now
12:13 - if you look at how these elements are
12:16 - laid out they all have classes Anton I
12:20 - don't think we're gonna have time to
12:21 - build a tinder clone but maybe you could
12:25 - do that as an extension of what you
12:26 - learn here today okay but like I was
12:29 - saying for classes notice that they each
12:31 - have some different variants and some
12:34 - name attributed to their classes this is
12:37 - what bootstrap uses to style the web
12:40 - page to style the elements so it has its
12:45 - already predefined CSS library that we
12:48 - saw and you're gonna have to find what
12:52 - classes to add through the examples so
12:56 - see how you should style it okay so
12:59 - let's just backtracking real quick right
13:03 - here if you just want it the CSS you
13:05 - could have just used this but we know
13:07 - that because it comes with a brief
13:09 - predefined CSS for us we don't have to
13:11 - make it ourselves okay
13:14 - and I want to change this around a
13:15 - little bit one point that I made in the
13:18 - lesson is that this right here navbar
13:21 - expands make this a little larger LG the
13:26 - LG part represents a break point and LG
13:30 - is for large screens so if we change it
13:33 - to something like SM which is for small
13:35 - screens you'll see that because our
13:38 - screen size is now bigger than that
13:40 - small display the hamburger menu
13:42 - actually disappears and if I put extra
13:46 - large or even large and save it it
13:50 - appears again but let's find the happy
13:53 - medium and I want to change this for
13:55 - let's see medium sized screens so that
13:58 - when I hit that medium break point
14:00 - notice I'm dragging this window across
14:02 - and well there we go we hit the medium
14:05 - breakpoint that menu disappeared and we
14:07 - have all the links again let's see let's
14:11 - also change this instead of navbar let's
14:16 - see let's do boots boots and straps
14:19 - that's that's gonna be the idea for our
14:22 - little web site today boots and straps
14:24 - it's gonna be a website about boots and
14:26 - straps using bootstrap okay so cool and
14:31 - you can you guys can follow along it all
14:34 - right are you sure you can follow along
14:36 - and you can make it as we build it
14:39 - together dogon is the navbar sticky it's
14:43 - not but we can definitely make it sticky
14:46 - so let's change that a little later I'm
14:48 - just gonna edit a few other links first
14:51 - and so like if you guys are familiar
14:53 - with HTML which is probably the only
14:55 - prerequisite you'll see the traditional
14:59 - elements here so you have all the tags
15:01 - and mmm nope not gonna go there
15:05 - you'll see all the links and elements
15:07 - like the a tag for our link let's change
15:10 - the name of that let's say instead let's
15:12 - say it's boots
15:13 - I want a link for boots and for our
15:16 - drop-down types of straps and you guys
15:20 - at home you could name it whatever you
15:23 - care for I'm just coming up with things
15:25 - on the fly
15:27 - so like what's nylon maybe some rope
15:31 - here
15:35 - something else here let's see is look
15:38 - let's say it's the actual bootstrap
15:41 - framework oh thanks for that Alex yeah
15:44 - and for anyone else in the chat if you
15:46 - want to click code along with us click
15:48 - on that link below
15:49 - I roll that was posted and the great
15:52 - thing about the examples is that like I
15:54 - said we can tweak it to how we want we
15:56 - don't always need anything need
15:58 - everything so this list I'll list item
16:02 - right here that's nav item it's disabled
16:05 - you can't you can't click on it it
16:06 - doesn't do anything and sometimes you
16:09 - wouldn't want to implement that logic if
16:11 - your website has a specific user who's
16:14 - not allowed to do something but for our
16:16 - case we don't need it so I'm just going
16:18 - to delete it and I'm going to save it
16:20 - again and look it's disappeared and we
16:23 - have our site and it's super responsive
16:28 - awesome I'm gonna leave the the search
16:32 - bar up for now since we're making a mock
16:35 - site anyway it's not really doing much
16:37 - but I think that's gonna be it for the
16:40 - navbar if you guys have any questions
16:42 - about the navbar
16:43 - please ask them now otherwise I'm just
16:45 - gonna see how to implement that sticky
16:48 - top option for the navbar okay and I
16:51 - have a bad habit of opening new tabs but
16:53 - let's use the one that we have currently
16:55 - okay so I know that a sticky top it's
16:59 - not an actual element and I know it's
17:02 - some sort of styling so to add
17:05 - additional styling to bootstrap elements
17:07 - and components
17:07 - I used utility classes so for utility
17:11 - classes I'm gonna have to do a little
17:13 - thinking it's gonna be something about
17:15 - position how I want that nav element
17:17 - navbar component placed and so we can
17:22 - look through the common values that we
17:24 - see for CSS like static relative
17:26 - absolute fixed and there's a sticky
17:29 - option if I scroll down a little further
17:31 - I see examples about a fixed top and
17:34 - fixed bottom and a sticky top so
17:39 - I'm just going to copy that class right
17:42 - here and you'll notice that for the
17:46 - navbar that there's actually a lot of
17:51 - classes that goes with it so navbar
17:54 - itself is the class that makes the whole
17:55 - thing a navbar the expand navbar expand
17:59 - MD that's what we talked about for the
18:01 - the sandwich menu navbar light is going
18:05 - to be the color of it and BG light is
18:07 - going to be the background color for it
18:09 - so if I simply add this class sticky top
18:13 - and save it
18:14 - it's a bootstrap once we have more
18:16 - things you'll see that it stays at the
18:18 - top and Neal asked is it possible to
18:21 - customize bootstrap CSS classes and ID's
18:25 - yes so two parts of that if you want to
18:28 - directly download that file and include
18:31 - it into your project you definitely can
18:33 - but another thing you could do is also
18:36 - make your own CSS file and overwrite
18:39 - certain things that bootstrap provides
18:41 - for you guys in our example today we
18:44 - will include like one line of CSS for
18:47 - the jumbotron so you can see how we can
18:49 - add like a background to the jumbotron
18:52 - class I'll talk a little bit about that
18:54 - later and so Neal definitely possible
18:57 - okay thanks for that question
19:00 - you should I hope you're not actually
19:02 - scared everything seems to be working
19:04 - fine so far okay all right and again if
19:08 - you guys are lost or need some sort of
19:12 - help the step two part you guys can just
19:17 - copy and paste this directly into the
19:19 - index.html select everything in order to
19:23 - just get like a clean start but be
19:27 - caught up to where we are I'm not gonna
19:29 - do that just because I like where we are
19:30 - right now but let's keep going in the
19:35 - next step I know that my website has a
19:39 - little banner if you will and it has a
19:44 - let's see if I could pull this up again
19:48 - steps heats fun and I know it says like
19:56 - if I buy using the site you agreed to
19:58 - only eating cookies just kidding you can
20:00 - eat any kind of pastry and so I click
20:02 - and unclick click click and it's gonna
20:05 - display something else and that's using
20:07 - something called collapse and this link
20:11 - right here is actually a button ok so
20:15 - I'm gonna go back to index by just
20:18 - removing that last part refreshing the
20:21 - page Oh probably need 8,000
20:31 - but the great part about this I guess is
20:33 - can actually take we can take the code
20:38 - from part 2 and we're up and running
20:43 - again okay and I'll know not to try to
20:47 - find or look for the final products okay
20:50 - and before we do that's I just want to
20:55 - add that last part about the sticky top
20:57 - just because that's our own little touch
20:59 - to it and here we go
21:05 - so the next part we're gonna do is add
21:08 - that little button that banner for us
21:10 - and so I'm gonna again go to the
21:13 - bootstrap documentation and I'm gonna
21:15 - look for a component and the component
21:20 - of letter once is a button that is right
21:24 - here the button with a button link it
21:29 - just renders as a button as a link even
21:31 - though it's a button but I could have
21:34 - also used any other buttons here as well
21:37 - I could if I chose primary it would
21:38 - render a blue button a secondary a grey
21:41 - button green success a green button so
21:44 - forth and so forth so what I'm gonna do
21:48 - here again is take that example and
21:51 - underneath the navbar I'm gonna put a
21:54 - link here
21:56 - and it could have whatever saying that
21:58 - you want could say like thanks for
22:01 - chiming in look let's say thanks for
22:08 - chiming in and I'll save over it so it
22:15 - has thanks for chiming in but currently
22:16 - it doesn't do anything because I didn't
22:18 - add any sort of collapse functionality
22:20 - to it instead we'll have to then go to
22:23 - collapse right here in lofts and so we
22:28 - can use this to toggle the visibility
22:29 - content of your project with a few
22:32 - classes and our Java Script plugins so
22:35 - this one actually does need a Java
22:37 - Script in it if you didn't include the
22:40 - optional Java Script files from below
22:42 - this is not going to work okay and here
22:45 - are another set of examples again so I
22:49 - have the button already set up but it
22:52 - looks like there's some other attributes
22:54 - that I would want to copy so I'm gonna
22:57 - take those the only thing I'm not taking
22:59 - is the class cuz I already have the
23:01 - styling for the class and I'm gonna
23:04 - paste that right in oh and I have an
23:07 - extra angle angle bracket right there
23:11 - and I have another error somewhere see
23:15 - class type is button oh I've declared
23:18 - type twice don't need that's great so
23:23 - this one is going to have a target right
23:26 - here a target attribute of collapse
23:28 - example and what it's targeting is
23:35 - another element that has that same ID so
23:39 - we can add in a div right here that has
23:43 - that collapsed example and if I press
23:46 - ENTER and I save it noticed that nothing
23:48 - popped up on that page but if I click it
23:52 - appears so that's really what's going on
23:55 - under the hood this target is looking
23:57 - for something called collapse example
23:59 - and by defaults when we have a class of
24:03 - collapse that means that the the content
24:06 - inside it's not going to load just yet
24:08 - on the first load
24:10 - it's gonna show up as empty or hidden
24:12 - okay if I remove this you'll see that
24:16 - and I save the page you'll notice that
24:18 - by default it shows up and when I click
24:21 - it then it disappears right but we want
24:25 - the collapse there and so for those
24:28 - viewing thanks for chiming in glad to
24:32 - have you here glad to have you here yeah
24:38 - that's it okay I'm gonna fix some
24:41 - indenting and saved it and glad to have
24:45 - you here awesome
24:46 - one thing that we might want to do
24:48 - though is maybe Center this right like
24:50 - it's off to the side right now it
24:52 - doesn't look that good
24:53 - and so to style something we would use a
24:56 - utility class so the utility class we go
25:00 - back to our documentation we look up
25:02 - utilities and the thing that I want here
25:06 - is text related no it's text related and
25:09 - if I look through the examples I see
25:12 - there is some example about
25:15 - center-aligned text along all viewports
25:18 - viewports are just talking about the
25:20 - screen size really when you see a
25:23 - viewport it's talking about the content
25:25 - that is displayed in the browser so
25:28 - however big that sizes that's that's
25:30 - your viewpoint right and I copied that
25:33 - utility class and I'm just gonna go to
25:35 - the class here for the button and I'm
25:38 - going to add text align text Center and
25:44 - that didn't actually work and I'm going
25:48 - to hmm
25:50 - let's see if it works for the div if i
25:53 - text Center it I'll add it and save it
25:56 - oh the text is centered there so
25:59 - something's happening here where text is
26:01 - not aligning the button is not aligning
26:03 - and I think it's because of how it's
26:05 - actually displayed so this takes a
26:07 - little bit of background CSS knowledge
26:09 - but if our text isn't displaying
26:12 - centered it could be because of the
26:15 - button element itself it's just being
26:16 - pushed off to the left so even if the
26:18 - text is being centered the element that
26:21 - contains the text isn't
26:23 - pushed to the center so we can look on
26:26 - spacing click sizing spacing and what we
26:31 - want to do is set the margin to auto so
26:37 - right here we have class m4 margin and
26:41 - we want the left and right margins to be
26:47 - set to auto so that it will
26:49 - automatically Center for us let's check
26:51 - that out see if it works Center no oh
26:57 - and let's see display:block awesome now
27:01 - it's centered so we had to change the
27:03 - display from inline to block a little
27:06 - CSS for you guys and you can see a
27:08 - little bit of the frustrations of
27:09 - working with CSS too I guess
27:12 - but now we have our little banner for
27:14 - chiming in and we're glad to have you
27:17 - here okay let's take a break I'm going
27:20 - to look at chat for a bit and see if
27:22 - there's any questions Anton so that's
27:27 - exactly the goal of bootstrap we could
27:29 - build faster websites and it also has
27:32 - additional benefits of being cross
27:35 - browser compatible so you don't have to
27:37 - worry about how it would look on edge
27:40 - versus Safari versus Firefox versus
27:43 - Chrome and build on can we design with
27:48 - bootstrap for a site that uses WordPress
27:50 - for the CMS panel that's an interesting
27:53 - question
27:53 - I'm not entirely sure but if I were to
27:57 - venture a guess I would say that
27:59 - WordPress probably has its own styling
28:02 - for you guys or or some way to style
28:04 - your website that may be under the hood
28:08 - could use bootstrap I don't know if it
28:09 - uses it directly that'd be something
28:12 - we'd have to look up together and if we
28:13 - have time later in the end of the
28:15 - livestream I'd be glad to look it up
28:16 - with you okay I don't have to go - can
28:22 - we can watch us yes
28:24 - so Daniel after this stream ends so
28:27 - we're trying to aim for like an hour if
28:30 - for some reason you can't follow along
28:32 - with us yeah this stream is going to be
28:34 - uploaded as a video so you can follow at
28:36 - your own pace
28:37 - okay awesome and again if you are a
28:44 - little lost you can click on three and
28:47 - banner and take that code and paste it
28:50 - into in the index.html you're welcome
28:52 - Daniel and continue following along okay
28:56 - let's see after our I'm gonna do a
28:59 - little sneak and OH
29:01 - after our banner of sorts we're gonna
29:05 - make our jumbotron but thing I didn't
29:08 - really mention that is gonna be included
29:10 - as well is the grid system so our
29:13 - jumbotron is actually going to fit
29:15 - inside the grid system so that it's
29:18 - sizes properly it looks better and that
29:20 - we can take advantage of the grid and
29:23 - change our layouts to be that to have
29:26 - that responsive aspect of like showing
29:28 - up differently on large or small or
29:31 - medium or extra-large screens right so
29:33 - to make that I could actually do it off
29:37 - the top of my head now but let's go to
29:39 - layout and I want to look at grid and so
29:44 - how it works that's something really
29:46 - important to read up on but basically at
29:49 - the heart of it we have containers so
29:51 - bootstrap has containers that contains
29:53 - rows and inside the Rose we have columns
29:57 - so that's always gonna be the standard
29:59 - layout containers rows and columns we
30:03 - can have multiple columns inside rows
30:05 - and we can have multiple rows inside
30:09 - containers but that's always going to be
30:11 - that set pattern if you want to make
30:13 - things a little bit more complicated
30:15 - later on you can add rows inside columns
30:18 - but we're not really going to touch that
30:19 - for this livestream just know that you
30:22 - can do that you can make your site
30:23 - fancier than what we have right now okay
30:26 - so for the grid system let's let's just
30:30 - copy this for now and paste it right in
30:34 - and you'll see that we have a container
30:36 - it does some spacing for us and a little
30:40 - bit of layout just fix the indentation
30:42 - there but we don't really need some of
30:46 - this stuff in fact we don't even need
30:48 - the next two
30:49 - Rose we just need that first room okay
30:53 - and and we're gonna take that from here
30:58 - all right so I said we wanted to use our
31:02 - for Daniel sorry I just saw your
31:04 - question we do live streams every
31:07 - Thursday ah thank you
31:08 - around 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time we would
31:14 - love to have you in other chats and
31:15 - other streams as well thanks for
31:17 - checking it but back to the topic at
31:20 - hand about Jumbotrons it sounds like
31:22 - another component right it's another
31:23 - elements already styled for us let's
31:26 - take a look at how to formulate this so
31:29 - for the Jumbotron a lightweight and
31:31 - flexible component for showcasing hero
31:33 - unit style content if you're not
31:36 - familiar what a Jumbotron is and why it
31:39 - seems like a made-up word it's gonna be
31:42 - if it it comes from the fact that when
31:45 - you're at an arena or a stadium there's
31:48 - a giant TV called the Jumbotron or the
31:51 - company that makes it no wait Sony makes
31:53 - it the name of the TV is called the
31:55 - Jumbotron and it allows you guys to like
31:58 - if you're in in really bad seats or you
32:00 - need to know what's going on but you're
32:01 - not up close to the action you can see
32:03 - what's happening so like you paid money
32:05 - to be there you want to see what's going
32:06 - on and so the name of this Jumbotron
32:08 - component is to showcase certain
32:10 - important details or important work and
32:13 - we want it to stand out all right we
32:16 - want to take up a lot of space so here
32:18 - I'm just gonna copy the Jumbotron
32:20 - component class and I'm gonna paste it
32:23 - right where it says one of our three
32:25 - columns because we don't have three
32:27 - columns anymore we just have one but I
32:30 - want this Jumbotron to be in our
32:32 - component and notice that here on the
32:34 - sides we actually have a little bit of
32:36 - padding and as I make this bigger and I
32:39 - open up the screen the size of this
32:42 - Jumbotron and the padding also changes
32:44 - along with it that's like the great
32:46 - aspect of using the container and using
32:48 - the grid system it's making us making
32:51 - this convenient for us to have a really
32:53 - adaptable and responsive layout but we
32:57 - don't want a hello world here either
33:01 - let's see
33:02 - Stan let's do let's do a background
33:07 - first all right I'm gonna remove all
33:09 - this extra stuff I just want the
33:11 - jumbotron
33:11 - it's gonna be a blank space and so also
33:16 - for you guys
33:17 - coding along I'm gonna use this this
33:22 - little URL right here which is going to
33:24 - contain background of our jumbotron so
33:27 - I'm gonna copy that and this is the part
33:31 - where I mentioned we're gonna use a
33:32 - little bit of CSS this is the part we're
33:35 - gonna do it let's see in Jumbotron in
33:38 - our class we can do something called
33:41 - inline CSS where we assign the style
33:44 - right and to set the set background CSS
33:51 - and I know it's a URL that I want to use
33:54 - CSS I'm gonna Google search it's usually
34:00 - try to avoid w3 go to MDM here and it
34:05 - says I need to do a background image and
34:07 - a URL and I just have to pass in what
34:10 - the URL is let's see so I want to do
34:14 - background image URL and I'll paste in
34:22 - the at the URL there press ENTER and I'm
34:27 - not sure if you can tell but it's it
34:29 - actually did change all right I think
34:31 - there's just a few other elements that
34:32 - we have to put in there so let's see
34:38 - background image a no repeats CSS let's
34:47 - see what this has right here background
34:49 - repeat repeat why but it should be no
34:52 - repeats as far as I remember I want a no
34:57 - repeats okay fine I'm not gonna look at
35:03 - w3 schools anymore three-peat three-peat
35:06 - X okay here's the one that I once
35:08 - enhance on your rights let's use
35:11 - something else instead okay so I want
35:14 - background-repeat:no-repeat
35:16 - nots repeating and as far as I remember
35:20 - its I want something about cover to
35:22 - wonder if I could just find it here
35:26 - cover so bad habit of looking up things
35:33 - and new tabs edge cover CSS looking for
35:47 - scaling background images okay
35:50 - and what I want
35:53 - scaling image up containing and cover
36:02 - where is it so once Oh background size
36:07 - CSS tricks usually has it good no that's
36:12 - not the one I want either cover let's
36:16 - take a look
36:18 - so it would be background size and then
36:20 - cover okay
36:21 - so let's add this into our code
36:24 - background size cover oh sweet
36:31 - it's there okay I'm taking a quick look
36:34 - on the chats awesome cool all right and
36:40 - let's add some other thing div it's not
36:47 - another div inside here and let's see I
36:53 - want this div to also have text
36:56 - eventually so I'm going to style it a
36:59 - little bit with a background color and I
37:04 - want it to have a RGB value and I want
37:09 - it to be slightly dark just so some text
37:12 - can show up so if we do that's and we
37:18 - start adding some hello there some text
37:22 - it's not actually showing
37:27 - we can see hello there but we're not
37:30 - really seeing the background change so
37:35 - how do I do that background color
37:42 - background color let's see RGBA and ants
37:50 - on you're making me go click on the
37:52 - fifth link thank you and we have
37:56 - background-color:rgba it looks right but
38:01 - if I'm doing this correctly it should
38:04 - have some sort of it should have some
38:09 - sort of like greyish tint to it and I'm
38:14 - not seeing that I wonder what's going on
38:18 - but for the purposes of this livestream
38:21 - I'm just gonna try to speed it up a
38:23 - little bit and take a look at what I did
38:26 - before so at the end my jumbotron class
38:30 - is there I am setting the background
38:33 - style here and I wanted to have these
38:38 - attributes so I'm going to just take
38:41 - that and save it you guys can feel free
38:43 - to do that as well I just don't want to
38:47 - take up too much time with trying to
38:48 - debug this and honestly that's my
38:51 - biggest gripe about CSS in general
38:54 - anyways is trying to figure out what all
38:56 - of this does whereas bootstrap
38:59 - documentation is so much cleaner awesome
39:01 - it's showing up I'm not sure entirely
39:03 - what I did there
39:05 - but it's got to be something about the
39:08 - classes that I didn't add before that
39:10 - are adding that additional styling to it
39:13 - okay so we had a little fun you saying
39:17 - there before so boots are great I don't
39:24 - know what to say what else to say not
39:29 - the best quotes but it's something for
39:33 - us to work with for now and you guys are
39:35 - free to change it at home however
39:38 - you want it to do it but that's really
39:41 - it for the bootstrap part the Jumbotron
39:44 - component and if you guys want to find
39:47 - the finished code for that go to step
39:50 - four all right
39:51 - and if you've lost your way go ahead and
39:53 - feel free to do that as well see you
39:56 - know I'm glad you guys can share with us
39:59 - share this pain CSS is a little
40:03 - frustrating to work with sometimes but
40:04 - without it we wouldn't have had this
40:07 - this nice little background image to put
40:09 - in so sometimes just has got to wrestle
40:11 - with it the next component we're gonna
40:14 - do is cards and so if you think about
40:16 - cards cards are like mini containers of
40:23 - sorts and they hold a little bit of
40:27 - information that are similar across for
40:30 - the various cards that you have so for
40:32 - our cards we want to make like little
40:34 - tiles to showcase information about
40:36 - boots or straps or perhaps the bootstrap
40:39 - okay Daniel good luck with your exam
40:44 - thanks for chiming in and I'm gonna look
40:49 - up how to I'm gonna look up how to find
40:53 - that as well on the components page so
40:56 - we have a card here and it looks exactly
41:00 - what we want
41:00 - notice that they also have some included
41:03 - CSS where they put style with is 18 RM
41:06 - so that's just it sets the width
41:09 - automatically for them to be that set
41:11 - size regardless of screen size and so
41:15 - when we want to add another thing to the
41:17 - container remember we want to have
41:19 - additional rows and then we want to have
41:20 - additional columns inside those rules
41:22 - rows excuse me and so I'm looking at
41:29 - where my Jumbotron component ends so I'm
41:33 - gonna just quickly comment bet it jumbo
41:39 - and I'm gonna start a new row jumbo and
41:48 - this is gonna be the end of jumbo row
41:54 - comments are really important guys when
41:56 - you want to understand ooh
41:58 - and I guess I misplaced that jumbo first
42:00 - if you want to understand where you are
42:02 - placing things and you want to revisit
42:05 - code because otherwise you're gonna get
42:07 - lost well or I'm gonna get lost and we
42:11 - won't know what's going on but let's do
42:13 - card room here and I want to do another
42:17 - div oh another div and this div is going
42:25 - to be our row and I want to make three
42:32 - columns inside this room might have been
42:36 - a little ambitious here if we want to
42:39 - get done with all this but and I want
42:42 - three separate rows so I just copied and
42:49 - pasted that row sorry that column in
42:52 - that row three times and now we can go
42:56 - back and we can copy our card and paste
43:00 - it right in we have some indenting
43:02 - issues as well so I'm going to tab those
43:04 - over awesome and great we have our first
43:09 - card that shows up that's gonna be a
43:12 - little difficult to see because the
43:13 - image is not loading and we don't want
43:16 - the card title you don't need some quick
43:17 - explanation but let's see how to fix
43:19 - that if you go to the left-hand panel we
43:23 - have our first card image and I'm gonna
43:27 - copy this and I'm going to paste it
43:30 - inside where our sources because right
43:34 - now it doesn't lead anywhere it's just
43:36 - three three dots or no ellipses and
43:39 - while I'm at it let's just put an alts
43:42 - text in case it doesn't appear old boots
43:45 - enter and bam we have it right there we
43:49 - have a row and we have a column and
43:52 - have a card inside that column cool
43:55 - please cover how to align images in the
43:58 - center mm-hmm images in a row Adam oh uh
44:04 - let's see um maybe we could talk about
44:07 - that instead of cards then real quick
44:09 - but I do want to finish this one up real
44:11 - quick the reason why this spacing looks
44:14 - a little odd right now is because it's
44:16 - expecting three columns here so so this
44:21 - is actually gonna it's accommodating the
44:24 - space for this image but it's not but
44:28 - there's not any other content inside the
44:31 - other columns so it looks a little weird
44:33 - but if I copy this and I paste this over
44:36 - three times press Enter oops mess up
44:45 - right here and paste this three times
44:48 - over second one I think this just has to
45:00 - do with where I am putting this material
45:05 - so I'm having a lot of divs and I'm
45:08 - having a lot of columns
45:17 - so that is the right row and we want a
45:22 - column and this should be spaced hmm oh
45:25 - you know why that's because of the
45:28 - bootstrap example it's taking up a
45:30 - default width Oh should have noticed
45:34 - that we talked about that oh we gotta
45:37 - fix it now Oh awesome and we have the
45:42 - third one but it doesn't fit because
45:43 - it's just taking up too much space I
45:46 - think it's just that our image even as
45:47 - its smallest it's not gonna fit very
45:50 - well but if we stretch this out let's
45:53 - see we stretch this out notice that all
45:58 - three images are aligned okay I'm now
46:02 - gonna style it exactly like we did just
46:05 - copying and pasting for now just so that
46:08 - way I can try to sort of hit that
46:09 - deadline for the hour okay a few quick
46:11 - questions and I'm all aligning images in
46:14 - the center with bootstrap is actually
46:17 - quite well it's easier than you would if
46:20 - you were to use like traditional CSS
46:23 - just quickly go over something like that
46:26 - the the premise here like for let's say
46:32 - for our cards right they are centered
46:34 - because the columns that we put in
46:37 - automatically align so the grid system
46:39 - that bootstrap has in place we get more
46:42 - into this in the lesson in the bootstrap
46:44 - lesson if you guys are interested in
46:46 - that code Academy does have a 7 day free
46:49 - trial for pro users sorry 7 day Pro
46:52 - trial so if you guys want to check out
46:54 - any of the pro subscription material
46:55 - please do so and we talk more about it
46:58 - in there to give you a bit more guidance
47:02 - in the documentation we might look at
47:05 - something like for layout if I wanted to
47:08 - Center the images in a row I might go to
47:13 - the grid check out the examples here and
47:17 - it looks like so for the first one if
47:20 - that was the case I want to just Center
47:22 - columns I would just enter justified
47:25 - content MD Center MD being the break the
47:29 - break point for meeting
47:30 - so we might just eliminate that if I
47:33 - wanted to center something like I did
47:37 - before with text it could be text center
47:40 - like we saw here for text where was text
47:44 - center this class otherwise I might look
47:48 - towards spacing or or sizing no spacing
47:52 - is right and I could look at the margins
47:54 - and I could scale the left and right
47:57 - margins to auto so that our browser is
48:01 - gonna automatically space and Center
48:03 - those images for us okay I hope that
48:06 - helps we did that directly with the
48:09 - button here oh man let's scroll up a
48:12 - little bit with the button right below
48:18 - the nav bar right here so without this
48:23 - MX auto and d-block which an image would
48:27 - already be display:block it would be
48:32 - aligned to the left right so let's add
48:36 - those back in and notice that by
48:38 - including that the the button is now
48:42 - centered you can apply that same sort of
48:43 - logic for the for the images that you
48:46 - want okay see checking in with the chats
48:51 - thanks you guys awesome so I'm gonna
48:56 - keep going and we have a few more
48:59 - sections to go through the carousel I
49:01 - know that was really important why not
49:04 - it didn't show as you vote ah thanks guy
49:06 - where were you before man um yeah that
49:11 - makes total sense
49:13 - and I'm so sorry that I missed that but
49:16 - thanks someone's paying attention
49:18 - appreciate it
49:20 - okay and I also have some extra F here
49:23 - for some reason but let's keep going we
49:26 - have our cards set up it's a little
49:27 - willy-nilly I do think it's a little
49:31 - important to talk about break points
49:32 - though so let's take a second to go over
49:35 - that by defaults our cart our columns
49:38 - have a they kind of like an auto just
49:41 - thing going on but each row should have
49:44 - I can fit up to 12 individual columns
49:47 - and so if I set 12 it's gonna stretch
49:50 - out to take up the entire row so that's
49:53 - gonna be for any screen right because by
49:55 - default it has extra small listen and
49:58 - it's gonna be for any screens bigger
50:01 - than Excel and bigger so that's all the
50:03 - screens but I wanted to show up as just
50:05 - having a width of let's say six columns
50:10 - for like medium sized screens or let's
50:13 - do let's do small and big it's small
50:16 - then once I hit this breakpoint
50:20 - oh and adjust it for my other ones as
50:22 - well then you'll notice that that goes
50:29 - side by side and the last one still
50:31 - takes up the entire span of the room if
50:34 - I have three cards and we can only have
50:36 - twelve columns in a row and I have three
50:40 - cards three columns I guess I shouldn't
50:42 - make it for each then a span of four so
50:46 - for small screens let's instead of
50:48 - making it six let's do four and we
50:53 - should be able to see all three cards
50:56 - show up on the same row answer-there BAM
51:04 - now if I minimize it again notice that
51:07 - after I hit that extra small breakpoint
51:10 - that they're back to taking up all 12
51:12 - rows in the example that we do lists
51:15 - it's it's a little bit more intricate
51:17 - than that we Center it a little bit and
51:19 - we also justify it to Center the images
51:22 - so I hope if you guys want to to take a
51:25 - look and and implement that into your
51:27 - own code you can do so I really want to
51:30 - try to hit this 12:30 deadline I'm sorry
51:33 - 2:30 deadline I'm not sure how much time
51:36 - I'm actually gonna get spend with
51:37 - styling the images from here on but the
51:42 - options are there for you guys if you so
51:44 - want to okay so I'm gonna go and keep on
51:49 - moving take a quick look at the chats
51:52 - okay
51:54 - and that's gonna be for my column so I
51:56 - know that at the end of this let's add
52:00 - another column comment here and of cards
52:04 - I'm also being a little haphazard about
52:07 - my commenting but it helps so any little
52:12 - bit helps and just like knowing where I
52:15 - am and how this how this ends up where
52:18 - to refer back to so the next one that
52:21 - we're gonna do was the asta of carousel
52:25 - no I don't want that spacing
52:28 - carousel carousel and of carousel Oh
52:35 - ants on that's just crazy talk streaming
52:38 - another day yeah we're gonna get that
52:40 - we're gonna get through this okay just
52:41 - just gotta believe let's see class is
52:47 - gonna be Rove yeah so we're adding
52:49 - another row and want to add another div
52:55 - here and I want add another column okay
53:00 - okay cool
53:04 - trying all right so this next column and
53:07 - by this point we're almost done I'm just
53:11 - finagling with some of the the names and
53:16 - making sure that they're they're all
53:20 - appropriate tidying this up a little bit
53:23 - before we go on awesome so we have the
53:26 - last thing second the last thing that we
53:28 - want to add is the Jumbotron and it's
53:33 - also another component it's already
53:34 - styled for us it has a purpose and let's
53:39 - see here I need to find carousel
53:41 - carousel and carousels before they're
53:45 - like a horse carousel you can go on it
53:48 - cycles around same sort of idea here we
53:50 - want a set of images that we can cycle
53:52 - around and they have various examples of
53:55 - slides only with control and with
53:59 - indicators with captions so there's a
54:03 - lot of examples to choose from
54:06 - think you know what um I think I'm just
54:10 - gonna use the one that has the controls
54:11 - that was one that was asked for in the
54:14 - examples that we provide for you it has
54:16 - the ones with indicators as well so if
54:18 - you want to use that feel free and I
54:22 - pasted it in a lot of code and I have to
54:26 - fix a little bit of the indentation okay
54:29 - okay so let's save our code and here
54:36 - it's here it is on the bottom it's
54:38 - broken images again we can have we can
54:42 - access the the images here in the left
54:46 - the carousel images so I can paste those
54:48 - in let's see provide an appropriate alt
54:53 - text boots on no excuse me while I try
54:59 - to copy and paste as quick as I can
55:02 - boots on this is gonna be a book bag and
55:07 - the third carousel which is missing a D
55:11 - on that word and an appropriate boots on
55:17 - stone alt text save it's scroll down and
55:26 - here we go cool
55:31 - and we have images that we can click
55:33 - through grant it if I had more time I'd
55:37 - probably style this and space this out a
55:40 - bit more and have different images for
55:42 - the cards a little trade off I would
55:46 - love to just go back and answer
55:47 - questions instead though and so really
55:51 - like with all bootstrap stuff what I
55:53 - find super useful is just looking inside
55:55 - of documentation and figuring out what
55:57 - it is that I want and then copying it
56:00 - and once I have it I can then see how it
56:02 - renders I can play around with it a
56:04 - little bit more sometimes I might have
56:07 - to look on forums see what other people
56:09 - have done I've checked on sites like MDM
56:11 - and like
56:13 - CSS tricks to see what goes into
56:17 - actually styling it if I am having
56:19 - trouble and so that's that's really the
56:21 - thought process behind it and bootstrap
56:24 - makes it really easy for you to do the
56:27 - last thing that I want to include here
56:29 - is a simple nav component which is I
56:35 - just want to include because it's it's
56:38 - not the same thing so I just added
56:40 - outbreak there but the nav is not the
56:42 - same thing as a navbar the navs
56:45 - is more specific to certain pages you
56:47 - might not see it on every page but it
56:49 - does have a collection of links that you
56:51 - might want and so depending on how you
56:53 - the layout of your site goes you can use
56:56 - one of two examples here provided you
56:58 - can also customize it to your own liking
57:00 - but these are like safe bets that you
57:03 - know are gonna display a certain way so
57:05 - once again we're here we're gonna copy
57:08 - the example and since it's going to be
57:14 - the last real major parts of our
57:21 - websites I'm just copying pasting code
57:24 - because I don't like writing those angle
57:27 - brackets but this is going to be our nav
57:30 - components and end components so the nav
57:40 - component is going to be like a series
57:42 - of links that you got that you might
57:45 - want to include let me set up the row
57:54 - classes grow and also another div that's
58:00 - going to be in our column and I can take
58:06 - this copy and paste it all in if nothing
58:12 - else today was a simple quick copy and
58:15 - pasting exercise brought to you by code
58:17 - Academy it's important stuff and exit
58:23 - out of that
58:24 - save it okay awesome so we have our link
58:28 - so how I'm not gonna get any more
58:30 - descriptive with these links anymore
58:33 - than they did but you guys are
58:36 - definitely welcome to put your own
58:38 - little spin on it the only thing that I
58:40 - am going to play around with this is
58:43 - removing the disabled link like before
58:46 - don't really need it and so we have
58:48 - active first link no that's not our
58:52 - first link anymore but yeah but you get
58:55 - the idea
58:56 - maybe we can do one last thing on let's
59:00 - see styling or centering this so if I
59:05 - look up that last parts and look up some
59:10 - utility classes to style it maybe we
59:14 - could have some success all right and
59:16 - let's see I want a spacing and I want to
59:26 - set the margin again to MX Auto if this
59:32 - is gonna be a display if it displays
59:38 - block then it should work if not then
59:40 - we're gonna have to find another
59:41 - solution but I want to set this as an
59:44 - export oh and maybe we could do what we
59:49 - did before and setting it as a display
59:51 - block Oh
59:56 - hmm what if we set our column so that
60:01 - makes a lot of instead let's see how my
60:09 - Center links maybe they have it back in
60:11 - components and I just missed it
60:15 - let's see components and I go down to
60:19 - NAB's ah okay I think I'm seeing
60:28 - something so write a line horizontal a
60:30 - line here we go
60:33 - copy that class slap that bad boy on
60:39 - alright
60:42 - fix my quotes very important boom okay
60:46 - awesome and then we have centered links
60:49 - okay I think we just made it in time for
60:52 - the hour it's not as styled as I wanted
60:57 - it to be if you want to check out the
60:59 - more stylized and finalized version you
61:03 - can go click on eight final and copy and
61:05 - paste that over but I think there's also
61:07 - some merit to being able to do this in
61:10 - an hour with bootstrap so that's also
61:11 - something on its own if you guys were
61:14 - following along congrats to you guys as
61:15 - well we're gonna stick around on the
61:18 - chat for a little bit but I think that's
61:21 - really it for the livestream I'll stay
61:24 - here for a few more questions if you
61:25 - guys have it have any excuse me and
61:28 - thank you guys for joining in really
61:30 - appreciate it it was really fun doing
61:32 - this and nerve-wracking I should say too
61:35 - but it was great thanks if I stop this
61:40 - livestream is a is the chat still gonna
61:43 - be there alright catch you guys later
61:49 - okay I gotta find this

Cleaned transcript:

all right I guess we're streaming was that a thumbsup oh okay so we are streaming hey hi everyone Kenny I'm a curriculum developer here at code Academy and I want to welcome you guys all to today's live stream today's topic is going to be bootstrap 4 so we're gonna be styling a website using bootstrap special shout out for those coming in from the CLL slack community code Academy lifelong learners hello and I want to say hi to everyone in the chat if you want to say hi is back that'd be great I love to learn a little bit about you guys where you're from maybe what you want to learn today and if you're on youtube and you want to access this site that is right behind me you can click on the link in the description below kind of all oh and hey Rachel vod's I oh wow there's so many people Lillian if I mispronounce your name I'm so sorry and you are from the passo you're a developer from the Paulding that's awesome Wow so many people from around the world Romania excellence hi Robbie that's a tough one bill bill guy hi bill Gahan hello and yes Alex here is with me too he's he's moderating wow so many people teach to employ carousel clickable image using bootstrap yes that is gonna be part of the agenda all right hi from India hello awesome we're gonna wait just a few more minutes I'm gonna just go over some like technical details so like if you guys are actually on YouTube and in the chat I can see you guys being active awesome click on the link in the description below and that'll lead you to the boot sorry code caddy website that is gonna host the code that you can then code along with us as we make this project happen sorry if I missed your names everyone but I want to say hello to everyone who did say hello back thank you guys if you are coming in from Codecademy and you found this through the news and noteworthy section if you want to check out the youtube link and it's full screen click on the title in that little iframe and it will bring you to the YouTube page so that you can join in the chat as well and I would love to hear from you guys love to hear from you all hi from Toronto hello back from New York hi Patrick all right so let's just wait another minute and then I want to go over a little bit of our agenda today what we're gonna build out as you can see if you're on the YouTube sorry code Academy site you can see a little example of what we're gonna be building out nothing too flashy but it's gonna have some cool little things that you might not have known before I'm also hoping to learn a little bit from you guys today about maybe some things you know and bootstrap that I don't I'd be super cool well oh welcome for your first time here Raj and beer Raj I hope I said that right okay with everyone down acquainted hope you guys are comfortable at home I think we're gonna get started then okay got it right the first time sorry alright so today we're gonna be learning about bootstrap 4 and so bootstrap 4 is a frontend framework now when we talk about frontend we're talking about the display that you're seeing on a website compare it's like a backend where that's where you would see the logic that takes care of the the stuff that goes on in the front end and so when we talk and then when you hear things like full stack it incorporates both frontend and backend now I also mentioned that it's a framework meaning that someone or a team of people have already written this code for you so that you can use in your project and you don't have to rewrite everything from scratch because that really defeats the purpose of this right like if we're trying to style a website why don't we jump straight to just writing our own see which is the cascading stylesheets you'd normally see on a website to make it look nicer okay now bootstrap is really great is because it allows us to create like responsive sites if you've seen the term responsive before it just means that it's it changes the layout of your site to accommodate different screen sizes so whether you're on mobile or you're on a desktop despite the screen differences you'll still get a pleasurable browsing experience so let's say let's if we take a look on the site behind me right now that's let's say a small screen and if we expand it you'll notice that things the layout of it changes ever so slightly but it's still like the same sort of material same elements there okay the goal of today's live stream is not gonna be to just make exactly this I want you to guys feel comfortable with using bootstrap so we are gonna be looking through documentation today I know that's like a scary word sometimes at first but bootstrap off like has great documentation it has great examples and the way I use it and I hope a lot of other people are using it or just grabbing examples so we're gonna take examples directly from the documentation and we're gonna make it into our own little code let's see I'm glad you guys have all said those highs I hope you guys are gonna feel comfortable asking questions as well I love to hear you guys about that and I already saw a suggestion about the carousel example making clickable carousel images that's gonna be this little tidbit right here for those who don't know a carousel is like the slideshow of images and you can click through that so if we don't get through all of it or if you guys get lost at any point too if you click on this folder icon you'll see another folder called steps and I'm gonna stop at each point and you guys if you get lost you can check out what code we have so far and some of the comments that are in there so that you can jump back into the code along okay currently I have the final final page set up right here on the right but I'm gonna remove that and we're gonna go to our blank page which you guys should all have okay let's take a brief pause right here are there any questions before we start where any problems with connecting wait for a few seconds in the chat if not I just really have to assume that we're all good and dandy alright let's go let's do it alright so first things first I'm gonna need the documentation so let's look it up everything seems okay let's go so we're looking for a bootstrap and I'm just going to Google bootstrap and look it's the first result that pops up alright so for us we want to get started because that's what you guys are asking for in the live stream and that's exactly what we're going to do so it has a little bit of information for us like an introduction a QuickStart if we just want the CSS we can take this link right here copy to clipboard bootstrap also offers some JavaScript files which allows us to add more interactivity so like that carousel component that we had that we were able to click through that was because we have JavaScript in there and they had some like other libraries like jQuery and popper here for us and if I scroll down a little further because I know I've gotten acquainted with this there's actually a starter template so for all you guys coding along at home just copy it click the copy button or you can manually click through everything and select it but I'm gonna be lazy and click the copy I'm going to just paste it right over I'm just gonna refresh that real quick okay so notice that we have the title hello world and our body elements let's see we have going to make this also bigger so you guys can see what I'm coding along with we have a title hello world we also have in our header hello world but I don't think our title is gonna be a hello world let's do something like bootstrap livestream that's not gonna show up and we don't really need this hello world's text either so I'm going to clear that out and currently we're gonna have a blank page and that's the end of our first step we've incorporated bootstrap into our projects thumbs up for you guys we're just gonna keep on going from here I will also look over chat as I said I'm gonna stop along every point and this is the end of our step 1 if there's any questions feel free to ask ok I know because I've kind of worked on this that the next step is going to be making or adding really a navigation bar and so the navigation bar in our lesson we talk about components utilities and the grid system and a and it sounds like the navbar is a component because it's it's an element that is that has some sort of default styling and it has a function for us right so the navbar is going to be found in this components tab and we'll just have to locate where the navbar is so then for the navbar documentation and examples for bootstraps powerful responsive meaning that it's gonna change its layout depending on screen size navigation header the nav bar and it also has ironically well an example of it at the very top and so you can read through about how it works but let's just jump right into it and ooh this example looks pretty close to what we need right so again I'm just gonna copy the code and I'm going to place it right in and that looks good to me there is a little bit of spacing issues indent issues so I'm going to edit that's I'm just gonna select everything and press tab once and that should clear it for us let's enter it say you to run the code you're gonna click Save or press command enter or control enter command enter for those on Macs control enter for those on PC I usually asked what's a bootstrap and bootstrap is the framework that we're gonna be working with today to style our HTML pages okay let's see so right now we have awesome we have the actual navbar located there for us and we have something called a sandwich menu or a hamburger menu that when you click on it it has all the different links okay so this is great for us we actually want to change a few things so right now if you look at how these elements are laid out they all have classes Anton I don't think we're gonna have time to build a tinder clone but maybe you could do that as an extension of what you learn here today okay but like I was saying for classes notice that they each have some different variants and some name attributed to their classes this is what bootstrap uses to style the web page to style the elements so it has its already predefined CSS library that we saw and you're gonna have to find what classes to add through the examples so see how you should style it okay so let's just backtracking real quick right here if you just want it the CSS you could have just used this but we know that because it comes with a brief predefined CSS for us we don't have to make it ourselves okay and I want to change this around a little bit one point that I made in the lesson is that this right here navbar expands make this a little larger LG the LG part represents a break point and LG is for large screens so if we change it to something like SM which is for small screens you'll see that because our screen size is now bigger than that small display the hamburger menu actually disappears and if I put extra large or even large and save it it appears again but let's find the happy medium and I want to change this for let's see medium sized screens so that when I hit that medium break point notice I'm dragging this window across and well there we go we hit the medium breakpoint that menu disappeared and we have all the links again let's see let's also change this instead of navbar let's see let's do boots boots and straps that's that's gonna be the idea for our little web site today boots and straps it's gonna be a website about boots and straps using bootstrap okay so cool and you can you guys can follow along it all right are you sure you can follow along and you can make it as we build it together dogon is the navbar sticky it's not but we can definitely make it sticky so let's change that a little later I'm just gonna edit a few other links first and so like if you guys are familiar with HTML which is probably the only prerequisite you'll see the traditional elements here so you have all the tags and mmm nope not gonna go there you'll see all the links and elements like the a tag for our link let's change the name of that let's say instead let's say it's boots I want a link for boots and for our dropdown types of straps and you guys at home you could name it whatever you care for I'm just coming up with things on the fly so like what's nylon maybe some rope here something else here let's see is look let's say it's the actual bootstrap framework oh thanks for that Alex yeah and for anyone else in the chat if you want to click code along with us click on that link below I roll that was posted and the great thing about the examples is that like I said we can tweak it to how we want we don't always need anything need everything so this list I'll list item right here that's nav item it's disabled you can't you can't click on it it doesn't do anything and sometimes you wouldn't want to implement that logic if your website has a specific user who's not allowed to do something but for our case we don't need it so I'm just going to delete it and I'm going to save it again and look it's disappeared and we have our site and it's super responsive awesome I'm gonna leave the the search bar up for now since we're making a mock site anyway it's not really doing much but I think that's gonna be it for the navbar if you guys have any questions about the navbar please ask them now otherwise I'm just gonna see how to implement that sticky top option for the navbar okay and I have a bad habit of opening new tabs but let's use the one that we have currently okay so I know that a sticky top it's not an actual element and I know it's some sort of styling so to add additional styling to bootstrap elements and components I used utility classes so for utility classes I'm gonna have to do a little thinking it's gonna be something about position how I want that nav element navbar component placed and so we can look through the common values that we see for CSS like static relative absolute fixed and there's a sticky option if I scroll down a little further I see examples about a fixed top and fixed bottom and a sticky top so I'm just going to copy that class right here and you'll notice that for the navbar that there's actually a lot of classes that goes with it so navbar itself is the class that makes the whole thing a navbar the expand navbar expand MD that's what we talked about for the the sandwich menu navbar light is going to be the color of it and BG light is going to be the background color for it so if I simply add this class sticky top and save it it's a bootstrap once we have more things you'll see that it stays at the top and Neal asked is it possible to customize bootstrap CSS classes and ID's yes so two parts of that if you want to directly download that file and include it into your project you definitely can but another thing you could do is also make your own CSS file and overwrite certain things that bootstrap provides for you guys in our example today we will include like one line of CSS for the jumbotron so you can see how we can add like a background to the jumbotron class I'll talk a little bit about that later and so Neal definitely possible okay thanks for that question you should I hope you're not actually scared everything seems to be working fine so far okay all right and again if you guys are lost or need some sort of help the step two part you guys can just copy and paste this directly into the index.html select everything in order to just get like a clean start but be caught up to where we are I'm not gonna do that just because I like where we are right now but let's keep going in the next step I know that my website has a little banner if you will and it has a let's see if I could pull this up again steps heats fun and I know it says like if I buy using the site you agreed to only eating cookies just kidding you can eat any kind of pastry and so I click and unclick click click and it's gonna display something else and that's using something called collapse and this link right here is actually a button ok so I'm gonna go back to index by just removing that last part refreshing the page Oh probably need 8,000 but the great part about this I guess is can actually take we can take the code from part 2 and we're up and running again okay and I'll know not to try to find or look for the final products okay and before we do that's I just want to add that last part about the sticky top just because that's our own little touch to it and here we go so the next part we're gonna do is add that little button that banner for us and so I'm gonna again go to the bootstrap documentation and I'm gonna look for a component and the component of letter once is a button that is right here the button with a button link it just renders as a button as a link even though it's a button but I could have also used any other buttons here as well I could if I chose primary it would render a blue button a secondary a grey button green success a green button so forth and so forth so what I'm gonna do here again is take that example and underneath the navbar I'm gonna put a link here and it could have whatever saying that you want could say like thanks for chiming in look let's say thanks for chiming in and I'll save over it so it has thanks for chiming in but currently it doesn't do anything because I didn't add any sort of collapse functionality to it instead we'll have to then go to collapse right here in lofts and so we can use this to toggle the visibility content of your project with a few classes and our Java Script plugins so this one actually does need a Java Script in it if you didn't include the optional Java Script files from below this is not going to work okay and here are another set of examples again so I have the button already set up but it looks like there's some other attributes that I would want to copy so I'm gonna take those the only thing I'm not taking is the class cuz I already have the styling for the class and I'm gonna paste that right in oh and I have an extra angle angle bracket right there and I have another error somewhere see class type is button oh I've declared type twice don't need that's great so this one is going to have a target right here a target attribute of collapse example and what it's targeting is another element that has that same ID so we can add in a div right here that has that collapsed example and if I press ENTER and I save it noticed that nothing popped up on that page but if I click it appears so that's really what's going on under the hood this target is looking for something called collapse example and by defaults when we have a class of collapse that means that the the content inside it's not going to load just yet on the first load it's gonna show up as empty or hidden okay if I remove this you'll see that and I save the page you'll notice that by default it shows up and when I click it then it disappears right but we want the collapse there and so for those viewing thanks for chiming in glad to have you here glad to have you here yeah that's it okay I'm gonna fix some indenting and saved it and glad to have you here awesome one thing that we might want to do though is maybe Center this right like it's off to the side right now it doesn't look that good and so to style something we would use a utility class so the utility class we go back to our documentation we look up utilities and the thing that I want here is text related no it's text related and if I look through the examples I see there is some example about centeraligned text along all viewports viewports are just talking about the screen size really when you see a viewport it's talking about the content that is displayed in the browser so however big that sizes that's that's your viewpoint right and I copied that utility class and I'm just gonna go to the class here for the button and I'm going to add text align text Center and that didn't actually work and I'm going to hmm let's see if it works for the div if i text Center it I'll add it and save it oh the text is centered there so something's happening here where text is not aligning the button is not aligning and I think it's because of how it's actually displayed so this takes a little bit of background CSS knowledge but if our text isn't displaying centered it could be because of the button element itself it's just being pushed off to the left so even if the text is being centered the element that contains the text isn't pushed to the center so we can look on spacing click sizing spacing and what we want to do is set the margin to auto so right here we have class m4 margin and we want the left and right margins to be set to auto so that it will automatically Center for us let's check that out see if it works Center no oh and let's see displayblock awesome now it's centered so we had to change the display from inline to block a little CSS for you guys and you can see a little bit of the frustrations of working with CSS too I guess but now we have our little banner for chiming in and we're glad to have you here okay let's take a break I'm going to look at chat for a bit and see if there's any questions Anton so that's exactly the goal of bootstrap we could build faster websites and it also has additional benefits of being cross browser compatible so you don't have to worry about how it would look on edge versus Safari versus Firefox versus Chrome and build on can we design with bootstrap for a site that uses WordPress for the CMS panel that's an interesting question I'm not entirely sure but if I were to venture a guess I would say that WordPress probably has its own styling for you guys or or some way to style your website that may be under the hood could use bootstrap I don't know if it uses it directly that'd be something we'd have to look up together and if we have time later in the end of the livestream I'd be glad to look it up with you okay I don't have to go can we can watch us yes so Daniel after this stream ends so we're trying to aim for like an hour if for some reason you can't follow along with us yeah this stream is going to be uploaded as a video so you can follow at your own pace okay awesome and again if you are a little lost you can click on three and banner and take that code and paste it into in the index.html you're welcome Daniel and continue following along okay let's see after our I'm gonna do a little sneak and OH after our banner of sorts we're gonna make our jumbotron but thing I didn't really mention that is gonna be included as well is the grid system so our jumbotron is actually going to fit inside the grid system so that it's sizes properly it looks better and that we can take advantage of the grid and change our layouts to be that to have that responsive aspect of like showing up differently on large or small or medium or extralarge screens right so to make that I could actually do it off the top of my head now but let's go to layout and I want to look at grid and so how it works that's something really important to read up on but basically at the heart of it we have containers so bootstrap has containers that contains rows and inside the Rose we have columns so that's always gonna be the standard layout containers rows and columns we can have multiple columns inside rows and we can have multiple rows inside containers but that's always going to be that set pattern if you want to make things a little bit more complicated later on you can add rows inside columns but we're not really going to touch that for this livestream just know that you can do that you can make your site fancier than what we have right now okay so for the grid system let's let's just copy this for now and paste it right in and you'll see that we have a container it does some spacing for us and a little bit of layout just fix the indentation there but we don't really need some of this stuff in fact we don't even need the next two Rose we just need that first room okay and and we're gonna take that from here all right so I said we wanted to use our for Daniel sorry I just saw your question we do live streams every Thursday ah thank you around 130 p.m. Eastern Time we would love to have you in other chats and other streams as well thanks for checking it but back to the topic at hand about Jumbotrons it sounds like another component right it's another elements already styled for us let's take a look at how to formulate this so for the Jumbotron a lightweight and flexible component for showcasing hero unit style content if you're not familiar what a Jumbotron is and why it seems like a madeup word it's gonna be if it it comes from the fact that when you're at an arena or a stadium there's a giant TV called the Jumbotron or the company that makes it no wait Sony makes it the name of the TV is called the Jumbotron and it allows you guys to like if you're in in really bad seats or you need to know what's going on but you're not up close to the action you can see what's happening so like you paid money to be there you want to see what's going on and so the name of this Jumbotron component is to showcase certain important details or important work and we want it to stand out all right we want to take up a lot of space so here I'm just gonna copy the Jumbotron component class and I'm gonna paste it right where it says one of our three columns because we don't have three columns anymore we just have one but I want this Jumbotron to be in our component and notice that here on the sides we actually have a little bit of padding and as I make this bigger and I open up the screen the size of this Jumbotron and the padding also changes along with it that's like the great aspect of using the container and using the grid system it's making us making this convenient for us to have a really adaptable and responsive layout but we don't want a hello world here either let's see Stan let's do let's do a background first all right I'm gonna remove all this extra stuff I just want the jumbotron it's gonna be a blank space and so also for you guys coding along I'm gonna use this this little URL right here which is going to contain background of our jumbotron so I'm gonna copy that and this is the part where I mentioned we're gonna use a little bit of CSS this is the part we're gonna do it let's see in Jumbotron in our class we can do something called inline CSS where we assign the style right and to set the set background CSS and I know it's a URL that I want to use CSS I'm gonna Google search it's usually try to avoid w3 go to MDM here and it says I need to do a background image and a URL and I just have to pass in what the URL is let's see so I want to do background image URL and I'll paste in the at the URL there press ENTER and I'm not sure if you can tell but it's it actually did change all right I think there's just a few other elements that we have to put in there so let's see background image a no repeats CSS let's see what this has right here background repeat repeat why but it should be no repeats as far as I remember I want a no repeats okay fine I'm not gonna look at w3 schools anymore threepeat threepeat X okay here's the one that I once enhance on your rights let's use something else instead okay so I want backgroundrepeatnorepeat nots repeating and as far as I remember its I want something about cover to wonder if I could just find it here cover so bad habit of looking up things and new tabs edge cover CSS looking for scaling background images okay and what I want scaling image up containing and cover where is it so once Oh background size CSS tricks usually has it good no that's not the one I want either cover let's take a look so it would be background size and then cover okay so let's add this into our code background size cover oh sweet it's there okay I'm taking a quick look on the chats awesome cool all right and let's add some other thing div it's not another div inside here and let's see I want this div to also have text eventually so I'm going to style it a little bit with a background color and I want it to have a RGB value and I want it to be slightly dark just so some text can show up so if we do that's and we start adding some hello there some text it's not actually showing we can see hello there but we're not really seeing the background change so how do I do that background color background color let's see RGBA and ants on you're making me go click on the fifth link thank you and we have backgroundcolorrgba it looks right but if I'm doing this correctly it should have some sort of it should have some sort of like greyish tint to it and I'm not seeing that I wonder what's going on but for the purposes of this livestream I'm just gonna try to speed it up a little bit and take a look at what I did before so at the end my jumbotron class is there I am setting the background style here and I wanted to have these attributes so I'm going to just take that and save it you guys can feel free to do that as well I just don't want to take up too much time with trying to debug this and honestly that's my biggest gripe about CSS in general anyways is trying to figure out what all of this does whereas bootstrap documentation is so much cleaner awesome it's showing up I'm not sure entirely what I did there but it's got to be something about the classes that I didn't add before that are adding that additional styling to it okay so we had a little fun you saying there before so boots are great I don't know what to say what else to say not the best quotes but it's something for us to work with for now and you guys are free to change it at home however you want it to do it but that's really it for the bootstrap part the Jumbotron component and if you guys want to find the finished code for that go to step four all right and if you've lost your way go ahead and feel free to do that as well see you know I'm glad you guys can share with us share this pain CSS is a little frustrating to work with sometimes but without it we wouldn't have had this this nice little background image to put in so sometimes just has got to wrestle with it the next component we're gonna do is cards and so if you think about cards cards are like mini containers of sorts and they hold a little bit of information that are similar across for the various cards that you have so for our cards we want to make like little tiles to showcase information about boots or straps or perhaps the bootstrap okay Daniel good luck with your exam thanks for chiming in and I'm gonna look up how to I'm gonna look up how to find that as well on the components page so we have a card here and it looks exactly what we want notice that they also have some included CSS where they put style with is 18 RM so that's just it sets the width automatically for them to be that set size regardless of screen size and so when we want to add another thing to the container remember we want to have additional rows and then we want to have additional columns inside those rules rows excuse me and so I'm looking at where my Jumbotron component ends so I'm gonna just quickly comment bet it jumbo and I'm gonna start a new row jumbo and this is gonna be the end of jumbo row comments are really important guys when you want to understand ooh and I guess I misplaced that jumbo first if you want to understand where you are placing things and you want to revisit code because otherwise you're gonna get lost well or I'm gonna get lost and we won't know what's going on but let's do card room here and I want to do another div oh another div and this div is going to be our row and I want to make three columns inside this room might have been a little ambitious here if we want to get done with all this but and I want three separate rows so I just copied and pasted that row sorry that column in that row three times and now we can go back and we can copy our card and paste it right in we have some indenting issues as well so I'm going to tab those over awesome and great we have our first card that shows up that's gonna be a little difficult to see because the image is not loading and we don't want the card title you don't need some quick explanation but let's see how to fix that if you go to the lefthand panel we have our first card image and I'm gonna copy this and I'm going to paste it inside where our sources because right now it doesn't lead anywhere it's just three three dots or no ellipses and while I'm at it let's just put an alts text in case it doesn't appear old boots enter and bam we have it right there we have a row and we have a column and have a card inside that column cool please cover how to align images in the center mmhmm images in a row Adam oh uh let's see um maybe we could talk about that instead of cards then real quick but I do want to finish this one up real quick the reason why this spacing looks a little odd right now is because it's expecting three columns here so so this is actually gonna it's accommodating the space for this image but it's not but there's not any other content inside the other columns so it looks a little weird but if I copy this and I paste this over three times press Enter oops mess up right here and paste this three times over second one I think this just has to do with where I am putting this material so I'm having a lot of divs and I'm having a lot of columns so that is the right row and we want a column and this should be spaced hmm oh you know why that's because of the bootstrap example it's taking up a default width Oh should have noticed that we talked about that oh we gotta fix it now Oh awesome and we have the third one but it doesn't fit because it's just taking up too much space I think it's just that our image even as its smallest it's not gonna fit very well but if we stretch this out let's see we stretch this out notice that all three images are aligned okay I'm now gonna style it exactly like we did just copying and pasting for now just so that way I can try to sort of hit that deadline for the hour okay a few quick questions and I'm all aligning images in the center with bootstrap is actually quite well it's easier than you would if you were to use like traditional CSS just quickly go over something like that the the premise here like for let's say for our cards right they are centered because the columns that we put in automatically align so the grid system that bootstrap has in place we get more into this in the lesson in the bootstrap lesson if you guys are interested in that code Academy does have a 7 day free trial for pro users sorry 7 day Pro trial so if you guys want to check out any of the pro subscription material please do so and we talk more about it in there to give you a bit more guidance in the documentation we might look at something like for layout if I wanted to Center the images in a row I might go to the grid check out the examples here and it looks like so for the first one if that was the case I want to just Center columns I would just enter justified content MD Center MD being the break the break point for meeting so we might just eliminate that if I wanted to center something like I did before with text it could be text center like we saw here for text where was text center this class otherwise I might look towards spacing or or sizing no spacing is right and I could look at the margins and I could scale the left and right margins to auto so that our browser is gonna automatically space and Center those images for us okay I hope that helps we did that directly with the button here oh man let's scroll up a little bit with the button right below the nav bar right here so without this MX auto and dblock which an image would already be displayblock it would be aligned to the left right so let's add those back in and notice that by including that the the button is now centered you can apply that same sort of logic for the for the images that you want okay see checking in with the chats thanks you guys awesome so I'm gonna keep going and we have a few more sections to go through the carousel I know that was really important why not it didn't show as you vote ah thanks guy where were you before man um yeah that makes total sense and I'm so sorry that I missed that but thanks someone's paying attention appreciate it okay and I also have some extra F here for some reason but let's keep going we have our cards set up it's a little willynilly I do think it's a little important to talk about break points though so let's take a second to go over that by defaults our cart our columns have a they kind of like an auto just thing going on but each row should have I can fit up to 12 individual columns and so if I set 12 it's gonna stretch out to take up the entire row so that's gonna be for any screen right because by default it has extra small listen and it's gonna be for any screens bigger than Excel and bigger so that's all the screens but I wanted to show up as just having a width of let's say six columns for like medium sized screens or let's do let's do small and big it's small then once I hit this breakpoint oh and adjust it for my other ones as well then you'll notice that that goes side by side and the last one still takes up the entire span of the room if I have three cards and we can only have twelve columns in a row and I have three cards three columns I guess I shouldn't make it for each then a span of four so for small screens let's instead of making it six let's do four and we should be able to see all three cards show up on the same row answerthere BAM now if I minimize it again notice that after I hit that extra small breakpoint that they're back to taking up all 12 rows in the example that we do lists it's it's a little bit more intricate than that we Center it a little bit and we also justify it to Center the images so I hope if you guys want to to take a look and and implement that into your own code you can do so I really want to try to hit this 1230 deadline I'm sorry 230 deadline I'm not sure how much time I'm actually gonna get spend with styling the images from here on but the options are there for you guys if you so want to okay so I'm gonna go and keep on moving take a quick look at the chats okay and that's gonna be for my column so I know that at the end of this let's add another column comment here and of cards I'm also being a little haphazard about my commenting but it helps so any little bit helps and just like knowing where I am and how this how this ends up where to refer back to so the next one that we're gonna do was the asta of carousel no I don't want that spacing carousel carousel and of carousel Oh ants on that's just crazy talk streaming another day yeah we're gonna get that we're gonna get through this okay just just gotta believe let's see class is gonna be Rove yeah so we're adding another row and want to add another div here and I want add another column okay okay cool trying all right so this next column and by this point we're almost done I'm just finagling with some of the the names and making sure that they're they're all appropriate tidying this up a little bit before we go on awesome so we have the last thing second the last thing that we want to add is the Jumbotron and it's also another component it's already styled for us it has a purpose and let's see here I need to find carousel carousel and carousels before they're like a horse carousel you can go on it cycles around same sort of idea here we want a set of images that we can cycle around and they have various examples of slides only with control and with indicators with captions so there's a lot of examples to choose from think you know what um I think I'm just gonna use the one that has the controls that was one that was asked for in the examples that we provide for you it has the ones with indicators as well so if you want to use that feel free and I pasted it in a lot of code and I have to fix a little bit of the indentation okay okay so let's save our code and here it's here it is on the bottom it's broken images again we can have we can access the the images here in the left the carousel images so I can paste those in let's see provide an appropriate alt text boots on no excuse me while I try to copy and paste as quick as I can boots on this is gonna be a book bag and the third carousel which is missing a D on that word and an appropriate boots on stone alt text save it's scroll down and here we go cool and we have images that we can click through grant it if I had more time I'd probably style this and space this out a bit more and have different images for the cards a little trade off I would love to just go back and answer questions instead though and so really like with all bootstrap stuff what I find super useful is just looking inside of documentation and figuring out what it is that I want and then copying it and once I have it I can then see how it renders I can play around with it a little bit more sometimes I might have to look on forums see what other people have done I've checked on sites like MDM and like CSS tricks to see what goes into actually styling it if I am having trouble and so that's that's really the thought process behind it and bootstrap makes it really easy for you to do the last thing that I want to include here is a simple nav component which is I just want to include because it's it's not the same thing so I just added outbreak there but the nav is not the same thing as a navbar the navs is more specific to certain pages you might not see it on every page but it does have a collection of links that you might want and so depending on how you the layout of your site goes you can use one of two examples here provided you can also customize it to your own liking but these are like safe bets that you know are gonna display a certain way so once again we're here we're gonna copy the example and since it's going to be the last real major parts of our websites I'm just copying pasting code because I don't like writing those angle brackets but this is going to be our nav components and end components so the nav component is going to be like a series of links that you got that you might want to include let me set up the row classes grow and also another div that's going to be in our column and I can take this copy and paste it all in if nothing else today was a simple quick copy and pasting exercise brought to you by code Academy it's important stuff and exit out of that save it okay awesome so we have our link so how I'm not gonna get any more descriptive with these links anymore than they did but you guys are definitely welcome to put your own little spin on it the only thing that I am going to play around with this is removing the disabled link like before don't really need it and so we have active first link no that's not our first link anymore but yeah but you get the idea maybe we can do one last thing on let's see styling or centering this so if I look up that last parts and look up some utility classes to style it maybe we could have some success all right and let's see I want a spacing and I want to set the margin again to MX Auto if this is gonna be a display if it displays block then it should work if not then we're gonna have to find another solution but I want to set this as an export oh and maybe we could do what we did before and setting it as a display block Oh hmm what if we set our column so that makes a lot of instead let's see how my Center links maybe they have it back in components and I just missed it let's see components and I go down to NAB's ah okay I think I'm seeing something so write a line horizontal a line here we go copy that class slap that bad boy on alright fix my quotes very important boom okay awesome and then we have centered links okay I think we just made it in time for the hour it's not as styled as I wanted it to be if you want to check out the more stylized and finalized version you can go click on eight final and copy and paste that over but I think there's also some merit to being able to do this in an hour with bootstrap so that's also something on its own if you guys were following along congrats to you guys as well we're gonna stick around on the chat for a little bit but I think that's really it for the livestream I'll stay here for a few more questions if you guys have it have any excuse me and thank you guys for joining in really appreciate it it was really fun doing this and nervewracking I should say too but it was great thanks if I stop this livestream is a is the chat still gonna be there alright catch you guys later okay I gotta find this
