00:00 - hey everybody Dante from Co Academy here
00:02 - today I'm going to walk you through our
00:04 - new AI powered interview simulator this
00:07 - is a feature that we released a few
00:09 - weeks ago into beta and we're excited to
00:11 - have you try it out now the reason we
00:14 - built this is because we know that
00:17 - interviewing is super critical for
00:19 - finding a job especially a tech job and
00:22 - in today's challenging job market it is
00:25 - even more important that you build your
00:27 - interviewing skills uh to stand out from
00:30 - the crowd so we wanted to build
00:33 - something that will allow you to
00:35 - practice while you job hunt um so this
00:40 - is a tool that's powered by AI but gives
00:43 - you freedom to craft a scenario that is
00:48 - right for you so in the next couple of
00:51 - minutes I'm going to go through how this
00:53 - works and how it benefits you and
00:56 - hopefully at the end of this you'll try
00:57 - it out yourself and give us some
00:59 - feedback
01:00 - so let's
01:01 - start so what you see here is the
01:04 - interview simulator landing page and you
01:06 - can get here in a few ways number one
01:09 - you can get here via our Career Center
01:12 - in the navigation so if you come down
01:15 - here you'll see newon code academy
01:17 - interview
01:19 - simulator or if you are enrolled in our
01:22 - full stack front end or backend
01:24 - engineering career paths you'll see a
01:27 - link to the page here so you you see
01:30 - just release practice interview
01:31 - scenarios using our new AI power tool so
01:34 - if you C click any of those buttons
01:36 - you'll get to the interview simulator
01:38 - page which is where you'll see a
01:40 - description about what it is pred by
01:43 - open Ai and then you'll see an empty
01:45 - State here so when you finish your
01:47 - interviews they will actually populate
01:49 - here so you'll be able to click on them
01:52 - and refer back to them and back to the
01:54 - feedback that you get from the
01:58 - scenario and
02:00 - just as an FYI so if you are a free
02:02 - learner you get access to this to one
02:05 - interview for free um so you get to try
02:08 - it out for free if you are a free
02:09 - learner as a plus or Pro learner you get
02:12 - access to five interviews per day right
02:16 - so that's a good amount to practice
02:19 - while you are job hunting so free
02:21 - Learners can try this for free once and
02:24 - then plus and pro get up to five
02:27 - interviews per
02:28 - day so let's start building our
02:33 - interview so this is actually the most
02:36 - powerful part of this feature is that
02:38 - you get to actually personalize and
02:40 - customize your interview scenario um
02:43 - based on job title job level the
02:46 - scenario the company type and you get to
02:49 - add your add in your experience so you
02:52 - can see here with the job title we are
02:54 - starting with three full stack engineer
02:56 - front end and backend engineer so these
02:59 - happen to be three of our most popular
03:01 - career paths and these are also three of
03:04 - the most popular uh job roles that
03:07 - people look for when get going into Tech
03:10 - um Tech roles
03:12 - specifically so for me I'm going to
03:15 - start with full stack I have some
03:17 - experience with uh front-end development
03:21 - I also have some experience with backend
03:22 - development uh building apps with let's
03:25 - say flask python flask and apis so I am
03:29 - looking for for a full stack engineering
03:32 - position now we get to job level so
03:36 - obviously every role has a level
03:39 - attached to it some roles may be
03:41 - entry-level roles for people who are
03:45 - relatively new in the industry or coming
03:47 - out of college uh some roles may be
03:49 - mid-level and some roles may be senior
03:51 - level uh for me I'm going to I'm looking
03:55 - for entry level roles right I have about
03:57 - two years of experience um so I'm still
04:00 - looking for entry level roles not yet
04:02 - ready for mid-level roles so I'm going
04:05 - to click
04:07 - that and now we get to the interview
04:09 - scenario um and this is one of my
04:11 - favorite parts so when you go through an
04:13 - interview process for any job not just
04:16 - technical jobs you usually have
04:19 - different types of interviews you have a
04:21 - phone screen that you typically do with
04:23 - a recruiter then you have Behavior
04:27 - interviews that a recruiter may ask you
04:29 - but also so you may have behavioral
04:31 - interviews with other people in an
04:33 - organization um and then you have
04:35 - technical interviews which is typical
04:37 - for technical roles um in Tech and then
04:40 - final rounds typically happen with you
04:43 - know leadership or someone who is higher
04:45 - up who will ask you a set of questions
04:49 - for the beta phase of this feature we
04:50 - are starting out with just phone screens
04:52 - and behavioral interviews um this is
04:55 - these are scenarios that most people
04:57 - will encounter with and uh interviewing
05:00 - for roles and then obviously as you go
05:02 - throughout the interview process you
05:04 - start to get to the lot of parts of the
05:06 - interview but we're going to start out
05:07 - here with phone screens and behavioral
05:09 - interviews and for my scenario right now
05:12 - I'm going to click on the phone
05:16 - screen and now the fourth step is
05:20 - choosing the company type so there are
05:23 - different types of companies that you
05:24 - could work for right there are small
05:26 - companies startups medium Enterprises uh
05:29 - multinational corporations right if
05:32 - you're somebody who's trying to get into
05:33 - big Tech you'll probably probably be
05:36 - looking for a multinational corporation
05:39 - uh scenario right for me personally I'm
05:42 - a startup guy I love the grind I love
05:44 - startups those are the types of roles
05:47 - that I'm looking for for the scenario so
05:49 - I'm going to click on
05:52 - Startup and now we get to our experience
05:55 - so here in three steps we can add a
05:58 - little about ourselves right so here in
06:01 - this box I have to add information about
06:05 - my work experience or volunteer
06:06 - experience so I'm actually going to
06:09 - update this to 20 let's say 2020 to
06:14 - 2022 I was a junior engineer at code
06:18 - academy which is kind of fake because I
06:21 - wasn't but for the sake of the video
06:24 - let's say I was a junior engineer at e
06:26 - Academy right and let's also say for for
06:29 - a
06:31 - year I had an engineering internship at
06:34 - IBM
06:38 - right so let's say IBM let's say
06:41 - 2019 to 2020 right so that's my work
06:45 - experience again I am relatively junior
06:48 - level engineer so don't have a lot of
06:51 - experience um but I think I believe this
06:54 - is enough to get me in the
06:56 - door and now we go to projects and
06:59 - skills so this is where you list out all
07:01 - of your the skills that you have your
07:02 - hard skills soft skills and also any
07:05 - projects that you worked on right so for
07:08 - me it's already populated so JavaScript
07:11 - HTML I'm going to add CSS
07:14 - here uh know a little bit of python
07:16 - again this is a full stack role so I
07:19 - have to know some backend languages as
07:21 - well I know Python and flask jQuery is
07:24 - you know basically
07:25 - JavaScript um I'm going to add apis I've
07:29 - been built platforms with apis before um
07:34 - I will also add in some projects that
07:35 - I've worked on so add a new line here uh
07:39 - built an
07:41 - e-commerce mobile essay
07:44 - website I've also built a SAS
07:47 - platform built a
07:49 - B2B
07:51 - SAS say SAS platform right and you can
07:56 - feel free to add more things in in there
07:58 - as well let's say for the sake of it I
08:00 - know Excel and I know SQL and I know uh
08:06 - let's say Java you know so I have pretty
08:10 - good skills
08:12 - experience and education finally I'm
08:15 - just going to keep it as a BS in
08:17 - computer science um I think for a lot of
08:20 - people that's typical if you are coming
08:23 - in from another industry you can put in
08:26 - your degree here um because you'll have
08:28 - time to explain your you know your
08:31 - background and your projects and whatnot
08:33 - so uh for some people who are already in
08:36 - Tech you have a maybe you have a degree
08:39 - um in Tech um you can put that here but
08:41 - also feel free to put in another degree
08:44 - if you have it um if you're
08:46 - transitioning from one industry to
08:49 - Tech so now we we've we're done with
08:52 - setting up our interview
08:54 - scenario um and we will save that
08:58 - experience
09:00 - so here it is we are going to do a phone
09:03 - screen with Sasha right so what this is
09:07 - going to do is this is going to mimic
09:09 - and mirror a real phone
09:11 - screen um so I'm excited I have my glass
09:14 - of water right next to me and typically
09:18 - phone screens are 30 minutes um there it
09:21 - may be longer depending on what company
09:23 - you're working you're trying to work for
09:26 - um but the Baseline typical phone screen
09:30 - is 30
09:33 - minutes so let's
09:38 - start so welcome to my practice
09:40 - interview we'll get started in a few
09:50 - seconds so now we have the first
09:52 - question from the recruiter Sasha hello
09:54 - it's great to speak with you today to
09:56 - get started could you please tell me a
09:57 - bit about yourself and your background
09:59 - so this is where you would tell the
10:01 - recruiter about your professional
10:03 - background so when a recruiter asks this
10:07 - there're not asking a personal question
10:10 - right they don't they're not asking you
10:12 - about your favorite color or your
10:13 - favorite food or how many siblings you
10:16 - have they really want to know they
10:18 - really want a snapshot of your
10:19 - professional career and what you've done
10:22 - right you don't have to go into a ton of
10:24 - detail um just give them a snapshot of
10:27 - who you are
10:28 - professionally and in this feature what
10:31 - we can do we can do two things we can
10:32 - type in our
10:34 - response and we can speak our response
10:38 - here right now I'm going to type in my
10:40 - response and say the
10:46 - following
10:49 - I work
10:52 - on
10:54 - numerous full
10:56 - stack
10:57 - projects in the past last three to four
11:01 - years working for code academy and
11:07 - IBM and I'm make completely making this
11:10 - up but you get the
11:15 - gist I spent a lot of
11:18 - time
11:20 - using
11:23 - Python and
11:26 - blask and
11:28 - apis
11:30 - to
11:33 - build small apps and
11:38 - features that have
11:42 - helped the companies that I work
11:47 - for
11:49 - drive
11:51 - or user
11:55 - engagement and
11:58 - B
12:01 - I let's say my
12:04 - expertise is
12:07 - in let's
12:09 - say
12:11 - using
12:13 - python
12:15 - to
12:17 - build as backend
12:21 - apps and that's my
12:27 - response now Sasha says sounds like you
12:30 - have some solid experience in fullstack
12:32 - development particularly with python and
12:34 - flas can you tell me about a project you
12:35 - worked on that you're particularly proud
12:37 - of yes I've worked on many projects so I
12:39 - will go into some detail on
12:43 - one I recently built a
12:47 - website that
12:50 - helps uh let's
12:53 - say white collar
12:56 - workers improve their
13:00 - daytoday
13:02 - efficiency
13:03 - with uh let's say front end and backend
13:10 - mini
13:13 - apps and let's say I also
13:19 - implemented
13:21 - AI
13:23 - through let's say open AI
13:28 - API
13:32 - and let's talk about the results so
13:33 - typically when you talk about projects
13:35 - and things you've done throughout the
13:36 - interview process you also want to talk
13:39 - about what the result is so let's
13:42 - say after building this app this
13:50 - website my company saw
13:55 - a 32%
13:58 - increase and
14:01 - customer engagement and
14:05 - 11% increase in
14:11 - Revenue that's my
14:18 - response now Sasha ask that's impressive
14:21 - it's great to hear about the impact your
14:23 - work had on user engagement Revenue now
14:25 - moving forward in your career what are
14:26 - you hoping to gain from your next role
14:31 - I'm
14:32 - hoping to work
14:35 - on a wider variety of
14:40 - projects that incorporate new
14:44 - technologies like
14:47 - AI I'm also hoping to work on
14:53 - projects that have more
14:58 - visibility
15:01 - I spell visibility
15:04 - wrong inside and outside
15:09 - compy lastly I also want to work on
15:16 - projects that have a positive impact on
15:21 - our
15:27 - society
15:31 - now this is where a recruiter will ask
15:34 - you about you know details about what
15:37 - you're looking for in terms of your role
15:39 - so here Sasha is asking us in terms of
15:43 - the company location and work
15:44 - environment what do we prefer now this
15:47 - is very relevant in today's day and age
15:50 - especially postco where a lot of work is
15:54 - either hybrid or remote work um although
15:57 - some companies are trying to get more
15:59 - employees to come back into the office
16:02 - um this is something you should learn
16:03 - beforehand before you get into the
16:05 - interview process you should learn about
16:07 - a company's remote work policy um if you
16:12 - do if you can't learn about that on the
16:13 - website via the website this is the time
16:15 - to ask about that uh when you are given
16:18 - the opportunity in the phone screen so
16:21 - right now we're going to tell Sasha that
16:23 - we are looking for remote only
16:27 - jobs which again depends on your
16:31 - preferences um if you are somebody who's
16:35 - okay with hybrid you know you can tell a
16:38 - person that um but for me personally for
16:41 - this situation I am looking for remote
16:46 - only I'm looking for remote only jobs
16:51 - because I have two children so the
16:57 - flexibility is important for
17:01 - me however I am willing to go into the
17:08 - office once in a while maybe once per
17:23 - quarter understood flexibility is key
17:26 - especially with family priorities now
17:27 - let's switch gear slightly move to a
17:29 - technical question so Sasha is now
17:32 - asking me a technical question um again
17:35 - this is not a technical role but what a
17:37 - recruiter might do is try to probe a
17:40 - little bit at your expertise and your
17:43 - skills um and try to
17:48 - understand how fit you are for a
17:51 - role so I'll will respond to Sasha and
17:54 - say
17:57 - okay
18:00 - run and
18:01 - development deals
18:04 - with and please do not grade me on this
18:08 - uh I am not an expert so this may not be
18:11 - an expert answer but I'm going to do the
18:14 - best I
18:18 - can
18:22 - languages
18:24 - uh set front end languages and
18:29 - uh
18:33 - frontend I say front end languages like
18:36 - HTML
18:38 - CSS and
18:42 - JavaScript so this is a very hard
18:44 - question for me right now because I'm a
18:48 - beginner so I'm going to do the best I
18:57 - can
18:59 - and this is a very simplistic answer
19:01 - that I do not
19:14 - recommend Java and
19:19 - C++ front
19:22 - end
19:24 - includes website
19:27 - styling and
19:30 - interaction
19:32 - whereas
19:34 - backend
19:36 - includes Ser uh say database
19:43 - management
19:47 - servers
19:49 - and let's say in servers I'm going to
19:53 - stop there not the best answer but this
19:57 - is a demo so we're going to go with
20:05 - it right so now Sasha is asking me about
20:09 - a time when I had to integrate an
20:10 - external API and the challenges I fac
20:13 - during that process so I recently said
20:16 - that I integrated uh open ai's API into
20:20 - assass app um so I'm going to talk about
20:23 - that
20:25 - experience
20:27 - absolutely all right recently
20:30 - integrated open AI API into as SAS
20:39 - app the
20:42 - biggest
20:44 - difficulty was setting up rate
20:49 - limits because the
20:53 - API was a paid API based on usage
21:00 - so I had to think
21:06 - strategically spelled strategically
21:11 - wrong about how to allow users to
21:20 - access API based
21:27 - features
21:37 - now it's ask me about my previous role
21:39 - at code academy what was the most
21:41 - challenging project or task that I
21:45 - experienced let's
21:48 - say I had to work
21:53 - on making that app more accessible
22:00 - which was difficult because there are so
22:06 - many
22:09 - accessibility
22:10 - guidelines and best
22:17 - practices I was able to work with
22:23 - stakeholders across the org to
22:28 - understand
22:32 - important
22:34 - accessibility
22:36 - issues and address
22:39 - them with my
22:49 - code so now this is the end of the
22:51 - interview now we are going to get
22:53 - feedback from Sasha in a few
22:57 - seconds
23:05 - now here is my feedback from Sasha it
23:09 - says great job what I did well so what I
23:12 - did well I articulated my experience in
23:14 - my career goals I gave specific examples
23:18 - when I asked about
23:20 - projects uh I also explain technical
23:23 - Concepts suggestions for next
23:26 - time my response were comprehensive and
23:29 - well
23:31 - structured but I need to provide more
23:33 - specific details and examples to support
23:35 - my claims so for example I talked about
23:38 - the open AI API integration but I needed
23:41 - to elaborate on the specific strategies
23:43 - I Ed to manage weight
23:45 - limits and then I needed to talk about
23:47 - the details for the accessibility issues
23:50 - as
23:50 - well and then she tells me finally
23:54 - remember to pause briefly after
23:55 - answering and check if the interview has
23:57 - any qu follow-up questions
24:00 - questions so I made a strong case for my
24:03 - abilities as a full stack
24:05 - engineer Sasha was impressed so that's
24:09 - great and my an is displayed a good
24:11 - understanding of various Tech
24:15 - Concepts and that's
24:19 - it now if I go back to save
24:22 - interviews what I'll see here
24:25 - is my interview that I just did with
24:27 - Sasha
24:30 - and my
24:31 - grade right and then I can go back in
24:34 - here and look at the feedback right and
24:37 - I can continue to do this right if
24:39 - you're a plus or Pro learner you can do
24:41 - this five times a day every day and
24:44 - really get that practice in right
24:46 - practice is critical for building your
24:49 - interviewing skills right so luckily
24:54 - this wasn't a real interview um I'm not
24:57 - interviewing for entry level roles but
24:59 - you get the gist of how this works and
25:01 - how it can be powerful so you can
25:03 - personalize this scenario for what
25:05 - you're looking for then get that
25:08 - critical feedback that you need to
25:11 - iterate on your interviewing skills and
25:14 - you can do this while you're job hunting
25:15 - so search for those
25:18 - jobs practice your interviews and then
25:21 - you will be prepared to do the real
25:23 - interviews whenever you get that
25:25 - interest from a company that you've
25:26 - applied for
25:28 - so we hope this helps
25:31 - please try this out again if you're a
25:34 - free learner you get a free interview if
25:36 - you're a plus or Pro learner you get
25:38 - five a day try this out see how it works
25:41 - for you and provide us with feedback in
25:44 - the forums or on social media or if you
25:47 - have any issues with it you can feel
25:49 - free to contact our support team as well
25:53 - thank you have a good day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody Dante from Co Academy here today I'm going to walk you through our new AI powered interview simulator this is a feature that we released a few weeks ago into beta and we're excited to have you try it out now the reason we built this is because we know that interviewing is super critical for finding a job especially a tech job and in today's challenging job market it is even more important that you build your interviewing skills uh to stand out from the crowd so we wanted to build something that will allow you to practice while you job hunt um so this is a tool that's powered by AI but gives you freedom to craft a scenario that is right for you so in the next couple of minutes I'm going to go through how this works and how it benefits you and hopefully at the end of this you'll try it out yourself and give us some feedback so let's start so what you see here is the interview simulator landing page and you can get here in a few ways number one you can get here via our Career Center in the navigation so if you come down here you'll see newon code academy interview simulator or if you are enrolled in our full stack front end or backend engineering career paths you'll see a link to the page here so you you see just release practice interview scenarios using our new AI power tool so if you C click any of those buttons you'll get to the interview simulator page which is where you'll see a description about what it is pred by open Ai and then you'll see an empty State here so when you finish your interviews they will actually populate here so you'll be able to click on them and refer back to them and back to the feedback that you get from the scenario and just as an FYI so if you are a free learner you get access to this to one interview for free um so you get to try it out for free if you are a free learner as a plus or Pro learner you get access to five interviews per day right so that's a good amount to practice while you are job hunting so free Learners can try this for free once and then plus and pro get up to five interviews per day so let's start building our interview so this is actually the most powerful part of this feature is that you get to actually personalize and customize your interview scenario um based on job title job level the scenario the company type and you get to add your add in your experience so you can see here with the job title we are starting with three full stack engineer front end and backend engineer so these happen to be three of our most popular career paths and these are also three of the most popular uh job roles that people look for when get going into Tech um Tech roles specifically so for me I'm going to start with full stack I have some experience with uh frontend development I also have some experience with backend development uh building apps with let's say flask python flask and apis so I am looking for for a full stack engineering position now we get to job level so obviously every role has a level attached to it some roles may be entrylevel roles for people who are relatively new in the industry or coming out of college uh some roles may be midlevel and some roles may be senior level uh for me I'm going to I'm looking for entry level roles right I have about two years of experience um so I'm still looking for entry level roles not yet ready for midlevel roles so I'm going to click that and now we get to the interview scenario um and this is one of my favorite parts so when you go through an interview process for any job not just technical jobs you usually have different types of interviews you have a phone screen that you typically do with a recruiter then you have Behavior interviews that a recruiter may ask you but also so you may have behavioral interviews with other people in an organization um and then you have technical interviews which is typical for technical roles um in Tech and then final rounds typically happen with you know leadership or someone who is higher up who will ask you a set of questions for the beta phase of this feature we are starting out with just phone screens and behavioral interviews um this is these are scenarios that most people will encounter with and uh interviewing for roles and then obviously as you go throughout the interview process you start to get to the lot of parts of the interview but we're going to start out here with phone screens and behavioral interviews and for my scenario right now I'm going to click on the phone screen and now the fourth step is choosing the company type so there are different types of companies that you could work for right there are small companies startups medium Enterprises uh multinational corporations right if you're somebody who's trying to get into big Tech you'll probably probably be looking for a multinational corporation uh scenario right for me personally I'm a startup guy I love the grind I love startups those are the types of roles that I'm looking for for the scenario so I'm going to click on Startup and now we get to our experience so here in three steps we can add a little about ourselves right so here in this box I have to add information about my work experience or volunteer experience so I'm actually going to update this to 20 let's say 2020 to 2022 I was a junior engineer at code academy which is kind of fake because I wasn't but for the sake of the video let's say I was a junior engineer at e Academy right and let's also say for for a year I had an engineering internship at IBM right so let's say IBM let's say 2019 to 2020 right so that's my work experience again I am relatively junior level engineer so don't have a lot of experience um but I think I believe this is enough to get me in the door and now we go to projects and skills so this is where you list out all of your the skills that you have your hard skills soft skills and also any projects that you worked on right so for me it's already populated so JavaScript HTML I'm going to add CSS here uh know a little bit of python again this is a full stack role so I have to know some backend languages as well I know Python and flask jQuery is you know basically JavaScript um I'm going to add apis I've been built platforms with apis before um I will also add in some projects that I've worked on so add a new line here uh built an ecommerce mobile essay website I've also built a SAS platform built a B2B SAS say SAS platform right and you can feel free to add more things in in there as well let's say for the sake of it I know Excel and I know SQL and I know uh let's say Java you know so I have pretty good skills experience and education finally I'm just going to keep it as a BS in computer science um I think for a lot of people that's typical if you are coming in from another industry you can put in your degree here um because you'll have time to explain your you know your background and your projects and whatnot so uh for some people who are already in Tech you have a maybe you have a degree um in Tech um you can put that here but also feel free to put in another degree if you have it um if you're transitioning from one industry to Tech so now we we've we're done with setting up our interview scenario um and we will save that experience so here it is we are going to do a phone screen with Sasha right so what this is going to do is this is going to mimic and mirror a real phone screen um so I'm excited I have my glass of water right next to me and typically phone screens are 30 minutes um there it may be longer depending on what company you're working you're trying to work for um but the Baseline typical phone screen is 30 minutes so let's start so welcome to my practice interview we'll get started in a few seconds so now we have the first question from the recruiter Sasha hello it's great to speak with you today to get started could you please tell me a bit about yourself and your background so this is where you would tell the recruiter about your professional background so when a recruiter asks this there're not asking a personal question right they don't they're not asking you about your favorite color or your favorite food or how many siblings you have they really want to know they really want a snapshot of your professional career and what you've done right you don't have to go into a ton of detail um just give them a snapshot of who you are professionally and in this feature what we can do we can do two things we can type in our response and we can speak our response here right now I'm going to type in my response and say the following I work on numerous full stack projects in the past last three to four years working for code academy and IBM and I'm make completely making this up but you get the gist I spent a lot of time using Python and blask and apis to build small apps and features that have helped the companies that I work for drive or user engagement and B I let's say my expertise is in let's say using python to build as backend apps and that's my response now Sasha says sounds like you have some solid experience in fullstack development particularly with python and flas can you tell me about a project you worked on that you're particularly proud of yes I've worked on many projects so I will go into some detail on one I recently built a website that helps uh let's say white collar workers improve their daytoday efficiency with uh let's say front end and backend mini apps and let's say I also implemented AI through let's say open AI API and let's talk about the results so typically when you talk about projects and things you've done throughout the interview process you also want to talk about what the result is so let's say after building this app this website my company saw a 32% increase and customer engagement and 11% increase in Revenue that's my response now Sasha ask that's impressive it's great to hear about the impact your work had on user engagement Revenue now moving forward in your career what are you hoping to gain from your next role I'm hoping to work on a wider variety of projects that incorporate new technologies like AI I'm also hoping to work on projects that have more visibility I spell visibility wrong inside and outside compy lastly I also want to work on projects that have a positive impact on our society now this is where a recruiter will ask you about you know details about what you're looking for in terms of your role so here Sasha is asking us in terms of the company location and work environment what do we prefer now this is very relevant in today's day and age especially postco where a lot of work is either hybrid or remote work um although some companies are trying to get more employees to come back into the office um this is something you should learn beforehand before you get into the interview process you should learn about a company's remote work policy um if you do if you can't learn about that on the website via the website this is the time to ask about that uh when you are given the opportunity in the phone screen so right now we're going to tell Sasha that we are looking for remote only jobs which again depends on your preferences um if you are somebody who's okay with hybrid you know you can tell a person that um but for me personally for this situation I am looking for remote only I'm looking for remote only jobs because I have two children so the flexibility is important for me however I am willing to go into the office once in a while maybe once per quarter understood flexibility is key especially with family priorities now let's switch gear slightly move to a technical question so Sasha is now asking me a technical question um again this is not a technical role but what a recruiter might do is try to probe a little bit at your expertise and your skills um and try to understand how fit you are for a role so I'll will respond to Sasha and say okay run and development deals with and please do not grade me on this uh I am not an expert so this may not be an expert answer but I'm going to do the best I can languages uh set front end languages and uh frontend I say front end languages like HTML CSS and JavaScript so this is a very hard question for me right now because I'm a beginner so I'm going to do the best I can and this is a very simplistic answer that I do not recommend Java and C++ front end includes website styling and interaction whereas backend includes Ser uh say database management servers and let's say in servers I'm going to stop there not the best answer but this is a demo so we're going to go with it right so now Sasha is asking me about a time when I had to integrate an external API and the challenges I fac during that process so I recently said that I integrated uh open ai's API into assass app um so I'm going to talk about that experience absolutely all right recently integrated open AI API into as SAS app the biggest difficulty was setting up rate limits because the API was a paid API based on usage so I had to think strategically spelled strategically wrong about how to allow users to access API based features now it's ask me about my previous role at code academy what was the most challenging project or task that I experienced let's say I had to work on making that app more accessible which was difficult because there are so many accessibility guidelines and best practices I was able to work with stakeholders across the org to understand important accessibility issues and address them with my code so now this is the end of the interview now we are going to get feedback from Sasha in a few seconds now here is my feedback from Sasha it says great job what I did well so what I did well I articulated my experience in my career goals I gave specific examples when I asked about projects uh I also explain technical Concepts suggestions for next time my response were comprehensive and well structured but I need to provide more specific details and examples to support my claims so for example I talked about the open AI API integration but I needed to elaborate on the specific strategies I Ed to manage weight limits and then I needed to talk about the details for the accessibility issues as well and then she tells me finally remember to pause briefly after answering and check if the interview has any qu followup questions questions so I made a strong case for my abilities as a full stack engineer Sasha was impressed so that's great and my an is displayed a good understanding of various Tech Concepts and that's it now if I go back to save interviews what I'll see here is my interview that I just did with Sasha and my grade right and then I can go back in here and look at the feedback right and I can continue to do this right if you're a plus or Pro learner you can do this five times a day every day and really get that practice in right practice is critical for building your interviewing skills right so luckily this wasn't a real interview um I'm not interviewing for entry level roles but you get the gist of how this works and how it can be powerful so you can personalize this scenario for what you're looking for then get that critical feedback that you need to iterate on your interviewing skills and you can do this while you're job hunting so search for those jobs practice your interviews and then you will be prepared to do the real interviews whenever you get that interest from a company that you've applied for so we hope this helps please try this out again if you're a free learner you get a free interview if you're a plus or Pro learner you get five a day try this out see how it works for you and provide us with feedback in the forums or on social media or if you have any issues with it you can feel free to contact our support team as well thank you have a good day
