00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:06 - edible so edible is a coding platform
00:08 - where there are lots and lots of
00:10 - problems and you try to solve these
00:12 - problems using different coding
00:14 - languages So today we're going to solve
00:16 - three challenges using Python and edit
00:19 - so our first problem is called correct
00:22 - inequality signs so our instructions are
00:26 - to create a function that returns true
00:28 - if given inequality expression is
00:31 - correct and false otherwise you hear
00:33 - examples so give us an expression three
00:37 - is less than seven and seven is less
00:40 - than 11. so this expression makes sense
00:42 - it is true so we need to return true so
00:46 - here there is 13 is more than 44 44 is
00:50 - more than 33 33 is more than one that
00:53 - does not make sense so we're going to
00:55 - return because 13 is not more than 44.
00:58 - yeah
00:59 - so first we're going to do uh Define
01:01 - correct signs we have a variable called
01:05 - txt which is short for text
01:08 - so first we're going to do use a
01:10 - variable called solution equals evil and
01:13 - then text so evil is a function where it
01:17 - will evaluate the given expression which
01:20 - is whatever it gives us and then it will
01:23 - evaluate it and if it's true it will put
01:25 - true in the variable solution if it's
01:28 - false it will put false in the variable
01:30 - solution so then this does all the work
01:32 - so evil will prevent us will help us
01:36 - make the code short way shorter by using
01:39 - only this function you don't need to use
01:41 - a bunch of code in a bunch of lines of
01:43 - code it makes your work easier so it
01:46 - does shortcut yeah and then just we're
01:48 - just gonna simply return the variable
01:50 - solution which is either true or false
01:53 - so we're gonna check in and see the
01:55 - tests so let's see there's five more
01:59 - than seven and seven is more than one
02:02 - so five more than seven is already false
02:05 - so even if seven is more than one it
02:07 - will be false and in the console as test
02:10 - pass let's see another test so there is
02:13 - five is less than seven and seven is
02:16 - more than one that makes sense so we
02:20 - need to return true so we solved all of
02:22 - it so we're gonna go to our next problem
02:24 - so our next problem is called alphabet
02:27 - soup it's a suit with alphabet yeah so
02:30 - our
02:32 - um instructions are to create a function
02:33 - that takes a string and returns a string
02:36 - of a slider in alphabetical order so
02:38 - here are some examples it will give us
02:41 - hello they'll just give us a string like
02:44 - a word and then we need to get the word
02:46 - into uh sort its Letters by alphabetical
02:50 - order so hello will turn into ello e h l
02:55 - l o yeah and hacker will turn to Ace
02:58 - Quirk a c e h k r h and then h k r and a
03:06 - geek will turn into
03:08 - ink you can just do egg no not an egg
03:13 - plus a K well that's not really eight
03:15 - yeah it's supposed to be two G's it's
03:19 - something like that okay so note you can
03:21 - assume numbers and punctuation symbols
03:24 - won't be included in test cases you only
03:26 - have to deal with a single word
03:28 - alphabetical characters
03:30 - okay so now we have a function called
03:32 - alphabet soup we want the same variable
03:35 - it's also called text so first we're
03:37 - gonna do a of make a variable called
03:40 - sort and we're going to use the function
03:42 - sorted on the variable text so sorted
03:45 - we'll sort
03:47 - um the Kevin uh string or whatever and
03:53 - it'll sort it into alphabetical order
03:55 - but the problem is it will return all
03:57 - the uh letters in alphabetical
04:00 - order but it is in a list so we want a
04:04 - word a string not a list so we're going
04:07 - to use the join function as our next
04:09 - line we're going to make another
04:11 - um variable called join and we're going
04:14 - to do
04:15 - this which is for Strings dot join we're
04:18 - going to use our variable we just made
04:19 - sort and join it so join will make the
04:23 - list the alphabetical letters in the
04:25 - list into one word so here if you add a
04:28 - space it won't work because letters will
04:31 - be
04:32 - the letters will be separated by space
04:35 - in between we're just going to do this
04:36 - to make them into Strings then we're
04:40 - going to Simply return join to get give
04:42 - them an answer now I'm going to check
04:44 - and see the tests so here there is when
04:48 - we're going to change it into in in
04:53 - okay and then edibit will become
05:00 - it kind of sounds like edible it's a
05:03 - little different just uh look the A and
05:05 - the B yeah
05:07 - and determination look at the airport
05:13 - that is such a weird sounding word yes
05:17 - let's see a console and we we passed all
05:20 - the tests great now on to our final
05:23 - problem
05:25 - um it's called The Museum of incredibly
05:27 - dull things so a museum wants to get rid
05:32 - of some exhibitions Katia the interior
05:34 - architect comes up with a plan to remove
05:37 - the most boring exhibition why would you
05:39 - make boring exhibitions no I think
05:42 - they're all great with some of them
05:43 - they're just worse than the others like
05:45 - more boring okay so she gives them a
05:48 - rating and removes the one with the
05:50 - lowest rating she finishes reading the
05:52 - exhibitions she's called off to an
05:54 - important meeting she asks you to write
05:57 - a program that tells her the ratings of
05:59 - the items after the lowest one is
06:00 - removed so our we need to create a
06:03 - function that takes a list of integers
06:05 - and removes the smallest value here are
06:08 - some examples so give us a list of
06:10 - numbers in this example it's one two
06:13 - three four five so we need to remove the
06:15 - lowest number here which is one and then
06:18 - return the list without the lowest
06:20 - number so we're going to return two
06:22 - three four and five
06:24 - and for two two one two one it has two
06:27 - one so we're gonna remove the first one
06:29 - in the list which is this one and we're
06:32 - gonna return two two two one notes don't
06:36 - change the order of the leftover items
06:38 - if you get empty list return empty list
06:40 - which is square brackets and if there
06:42 - are multiple items with the same value
06:44 - remove item with lower index so this
06:47 - example
06:49 - so now we're gonna go to the code and we
06:51 - have a function called remove smallest
06:54 - with a variable called list
06:56 - so if list exclamation equal empty
07:00 - bracket well entry list so exclamation
07:04 - mark plus equal sign is not so if list
07:07 - is not an empty list which is two square
07:10 - brackets we're going to do list dot
07:13 - remove Min list so the remove function
07:16 - will remove something from a list
07:20 - so here we're going to add Min which is
07:22 - short for minimum
07:24 - or so it's going to remove the least the
07:28 - least valuable
07:30 - value in the list which is probably here
07:34 - one two three four five it will remove
07:35 - one so here we remove the lowest value
07:40 - um
07:41 - thing in the list then we're gonna
07:43 - return list if it is not an empty list
07:47 - so else we're going to return list if it
07:50 - is empty bracket now I'm going to check
07:53 - and see the tests
07:55 - so here move smallest there's only three
07:58 - so we're just gonna remove the three
08:01 - because it's the only number so when I
08:03 - return empty brackets here this empty
08:05 - brackets so we just go to else and
08:07 - return the empty bracket and finally
08:09 - let's see
08:12 - um three one six seven three seven six
08:15 - there are two threes
08:17 - and one so we're just gonna remove the
08:20 - one so we're number three six seven
08:22 - three seven six yeah correct so we
08:25 - passed all the tests hooray well that
08:29 - was fun and that's it for today thank
08:31 - you for watching Remember to smash the
08:34 - like button and subscribe bye bye
