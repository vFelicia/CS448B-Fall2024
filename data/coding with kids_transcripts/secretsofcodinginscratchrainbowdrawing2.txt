00:04 - today we're scratching my account
00:06 - kid.code123
00:08 - and this project that i upgraded which
00:10 - is supposed to be called rainbow drawing
00:12 - now is

00:20 - i hope this doesn't paralyze me again
00:22 - like last time
00:26 - it's thoughts
00:27 - please don't paralyze me just stop okay
00:31 - now let's see the upgrades so in a race
00:35 - because um in rainbow drawing um you
00:38 - can't erase so it's like basically a
00:41 - show yeah so now here you can actually
00:43 - like erase but you can't actually draw
00:47 - so the better the dots yeah it's drawing
00:49 - so when i press erase it will like
00:52 - cancel all
00:54 - the drawings yeah but the balls
00:56 - continually move so because in change
00:58 - styles yeah okay so here it uses the pen
01:01 - from scratch yeah so the costume is just
01:05 - the button i got from the scratch
01:07 - [Music]
01:09 - sprites and this erase i just
01:13 - text
01:14 - and
01:15 - when this sprite clicks so when i click
01:17 - it it'll erase all that's that's why
01:19 - it's called erase so you can get the pen
01:21 - when you go here in the extensions and
01:23 - then through all the pictures right
01:26 - and then there'll be like special
01:27 - drawing blocks yeah that's how we made
01:30 - this erase
01:32 - then and change background because um in
01:36 - the first video
01:37 - we only had the stars background so i
01:40 - added the moon galaxy and naboola so all
01:43 - these like a space speed yeah because i
01:46 - really think these are stars
01:48 - so
01:49 - i added change background so when you
01:51 - click it it will change the backdrop
01:54 - or background i usually call it so when
01:57 - this sprite click broadcast change
02:00 - background
02:02 - background and when i receive it change
02:04 - background in the next spectrum an
02:06 - easier way is just like looks then
02:10 - um
02:12 - backdrop so you don't need to go to the
02:13 - backdrop right yeah but
02:16 - you know
02:18 - just messages
02:19 - then
02:20 - my last upgrade is the sound so i made
02:24 - two new um
02:26 - songs so
02:27 - well it's from the scratch
02:30 - songs
02:32 - so this one is space
02:34 - and i like the piano one so it's not
02:36 - like
02:37 - space being but but this one is space
02:39 - being it's just called space but i feel
02:42 - like this is good with the yeah
02:46 - and so when you press one on your
02:49 - keyboard
02:50 - it will play the space music
02:52 - so
02:53 - the this one oops sounds this one
