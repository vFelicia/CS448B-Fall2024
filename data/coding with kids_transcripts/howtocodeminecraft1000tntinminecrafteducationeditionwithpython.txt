00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:03 - is claire my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - in minecraft education edition and we're
00:07 - going to explain the code of 1000 tnt so
00:10 - thousand tnt is an example where you can
00:14 - make like a huge cube of a thousand tnt
00:16 - which you can explode so when you type a
00:19 - thousand tnt which we're going to just
00:21 - change into tnt so it's more simple
00:25 - okay
00:26 - fill with tnt
00:28 - of course because it's very fun you can
00:30 - fill it with flavor i think the only fun
00:32 - things is actually just tnt and lava
00:35 - because they're destructive yeah
00:37 - so from one one one which is one block
00:39 - of bowie so you won't get glitched in
00:41 - the block which is very annoying because
00:44 - you know you have to break it then 2 10
00:47 - 10 10 so that's actually just a cube up
00:50 - in the sky you can also do it down in a
00:53 - cave and then you can explode all along
00:55 - and see if we get any good things yeah
00:58 - but there will be a lot of food yeah and
01:00 - don't explode yourself
01:03 - but if you're in creative that will be
01:04 - fine yeah so in python it's step on and
01:07 - chat so it's a function it's blocks that
01:10 - fill tnt position 111 to position 10 10
01:13 - 10 so it'll be your whole huge queue to
01:16 - fill operation dot replace and then dot
01:19 - player dot on check when you type tnt in
01:21 - the channel run
01:24 - so let's go and explore
01:26 - this place and i think we're going to
01:29 - get some
01:30 - yeah coal first let's get foot and steel
01:33 - okay
01:38 - to explode the cnc hopefully you won't
01:41 - lag
01:42 - so if you don't want to lag and do that
01:44 - much
01:45 - tnt
01:46 - i guess we need to change the code yeah
01:50 - so that's 10 pi 10 yeah okay so if you
01:54 - want
01:56 - if you don't want to lag i would start
01:58 - at the bottom
01:59 - but i don't i think you'll just one day
02:02 - one explode and then cause all the other
02:04 - one one
02:05 - by far one creative
02:08 - oh
02:09 - it's flying everywhere
02:11 - it's flying everywhere
02:14 - oh
02:15 - dude
02:16 - it fly everywhere look at what it did
02:19 - oh there's one more because it glitches
02:22 - because there's a lot
02:24 - oh
02:26 - there's still some in the air because it
02:28 - glitches
02:30 - they get exploded so far they just
02:32 - disappeared yeah let's see
02:36 - where did it explode
02:38 - here
02:40 - mostly dark
02:42 - yeah and stone then the water broke
02:46 - through
02:47 - it's like dynamite like when people want
02:50 - to create line themes
02:53 - but they exploded
02:54 - this block because all of that remains
02:57 - well two blocks of like oh one then
03:00 - disappears
03:02 - okay
03:04 - that was the big llamas hi llama okay
03:08 - i'm gonna try i'm doing the forest
03:11 - oh yeah so we can explode more trees
03:14 - and go here
03:16 - let's try
03:17 - tntg and t
03:22 - okay
03:23 - i'm just gonna explode the bottom one so
03:24 - that it'll fall and it will affect the
03:26 - other tnt
03:28 - so you should do behind the air
03:30 - that way but if you want more explosion
03:32 - it's like yeah
03:35 - okay
03:36 - oui
03:38 - and then it flies
03:40 - okay let's see
03:41 - uh
03:43 - [Music]
03:51 - you can keep doing the same spot to mine
03:54 - deeper and deeper
03:56 - oh no you set them on fire
03:59 - that's
04:00 - very deeper
04:02 - okay let's go deeper deeper deeper
04:04 - deeper deeper
04:06 - oh that one's going to fall out
04:11 - [Music]
04:17 - over there is the most um deepest
04:20 - because we kept on exploring it this is
04:22 - still only iron maybe we should make one
04:26 - on top over here like over here so we
04:29 - can keep exploding it
04:32 - okay let's do tnt last time
04:35 - one last time
04:37 - oh it's kind of stuck replaced
04:47 - it's starting to lag
04:50 - see it's glitching
04:53 - okay this is a big big
04:56 - one big waterfall yeah okay we got some
05:00 - copper
05:02 - a lot of dirt blocks and a stone block a
05:04 - little coal flint this flint haha um
05:10 - some
05:11 - xp from coal
05:13 - on raw iron obviously
05:17 - um there's some trees
05:21 - oh a lot like this
05:24 - cold cold
05:26 - cool a lot of coal tnt if you're in
05:28 - survival it will be good mining resource
05:31 - if you just be careful like you really
05:34 - care because if you explode 1000 tnti
05:37 - once it can cause you to lag and you can
05:40 - it can explode you
05:42 - which is bad yeah and if you if you do a
05:45 - thousand tnt that is a lot
05:48 - and a lot of range
05:51 - of exploding
