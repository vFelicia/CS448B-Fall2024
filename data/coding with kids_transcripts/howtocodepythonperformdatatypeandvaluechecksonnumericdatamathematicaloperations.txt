00:01 - welcome to calling with kids
00:03 - my name is kelly and today i'm gonna
00:05 - teach you python
00:07 - so first we already have a file string
00:11 - convert dot py so first we're gonna
00:14 - type first
00:19 - value
00:28 - equals
00:32 - in put
00:40 - then quotes
00:54 - then we're gonna do second
01:00 - value second
01:04 - value
01:10 - equals
01:12 - and put
01:19 - second number set
01:24 - two
01:26 - [Music]
01:39 - sum
01:43 - equals first
01:48 - value
01:53 - plus second value
01:58 - then print
02:02 - [Music]
02:06 - sum some
02:08 - [Music]
02:11 - some some
02:16 - colors
02:20 - plus
02:23 - string string
02:26 - string
02:27 - [Music]
02:29 - sum so here we need to type a string
02:33 - because this is a string two so let's
02:36 - say with ctrl
02:37 - s and run it p
02:40 - y s string
02:53 - first number bob if we do
02:56 - bob it will have an error because it
03:00 - it it is not a number first number
03:04 - 45 second number if we type
03:07 - not a number again it will do an error
03:10 - true
03:12 - so 89 plus 789
03:18 - equals 878
03:21 - that really worked
03:24 - now let's delete this then
03:28 - numeric oopsies numeric
03:34 - value
03:39 - you e equals
03:45 - seven
03:48 - then print
03:55 - numeric value
04:00 - dot is numeric
04:08 - then
04:12 - then save it with ctrl s
04:16 - and run it
04:21 - true because this is a number
04:26 - then let's do string
04:31 - string
04:34 - value
04:40 - u equals
04:43 - bob bob
04:47 - b-o-b let's save it
04:51 - and i forgot something pranked
05:00 - print
05:05 - print string value
05:11 - dot is
05:16 - numeric
05:22 - now we can save it and run it
05:26 - [Music]
05:29 - true false because this is
05:32 - not a number
05:36 - that actually worked because this is
05:39 - bob is actually not a number so
05:42 - print false then we
05:45 - need a print
05:50 - call i mean yeah then
05:55 - one two three dot
06:04 - is
06:08 - so this function will do
06:13 - if it's false or true if this is
06:16 - a number or a letter in the out
06:20 - of it so a b c d e o g
06:23 - the whole alphabet let's save it and run
06:27 - it
06:29 - true because um one two three is a
06:32 - number
06:34 - let's try one two
06:38 - three one two e
06:42 - save it and let's see if this
06:45 - works it's true because it is
06:49 - a number and an alphabet
06:59 - then print
07:04 - is alph
07:08 - so this checks if it's a
07:13 - letter in the alphabet
07:28 - oh yeah i forgot should be back it's
07:32 - here
07:32 - brackets
07:34 - [Music]
07:37 - go save it i always forgot to
07:40 - forget to save it don't know why
07:46 - [Music]
07:50 - lph a
07:55 - yep then now we can save it
07:59 - and now we can run it true
08:03 - because this is in the alphabet now
08:06 - let's
08:06 - try one does it work
08:10 - don't don't
08:20 - now let's do print
08:26 - is this one is
08:30 - not um
08:33 - it is checking if it's a number
08:37 - yeah if it's a number
08:43 - so a check if it's not a number i'll
08:46 - print false
08:47 - but it if it is a number it print true
08:51 - one two three ctrl
08:54 - s to save it and now we can run it
08:58 - it's true but if we type let's see
09:03 - uh f ctrl
09:07 - s
09:10 - false because it's not a number
09:14 - then print
09:21 - tie is tight
09:25 - tall
09:29 - so this will check if it's a title
09:33 - so um the first
09:37 - letter of the word the first word in the
09:40 - first in the sentence it should be
09:43 - capitalized
09:45 - so that
10:00 - it's false
10:06 - how about this control
10:09 - s planet
10:13 - true because um this is capitalized
10:17 - now to make it easier we can just delete
10:22 - this because the next function
10:24 - will be just like this is upper
10:29 - is up so
10:33 - over here it will check if it's all
10:35 - uppercase
10:36 - so h a
10:40 - duh it's all uppercase
10:43 - so i'll print up um uh
10:46 - true true but if i
10:49 - change the a into a lowercase
10:53 - it will respond or fall false
10:58 - oops
11:01 - false because this is not capitalized
11:05 - the next one will be just like this but
11:07 - lowercase
11:10 - lower
11:13 - oopsies
11:17 - i mean w's this has to be all lowercase
11:21 - but
11:22 - if i save this and run it it'll print
11:25 - false because
11:26 - these two are not lowercase
11:30 - save it and let's test it
11:35 - false but if we change these two into a
11:38 - lowercase
11:41 - it will
11:44 - print a
11:47 - true
11:50 - next first
11:54 - value first value
12:02 - equals
12:09 - first number first
12:13 - number
12:19 - then if
12:24 - value i mean first value
12:27 - first value
12:32 - dot is numeric
12:36 - numeric
12:46 - two equals false
12:59 - then print
13:06 - value
13:10 - i mean is not
13:14 - a number
13:18 - then if you're a fast paper because the
13:20 - second value is just like the first
13:22 - value you can just copy and paste it
13:27 - it's the fastest way
13:30 - but first you need it exit
13:35 - the exit function
13:39 - oopsies
13:44 - then we can copy and paste
14:02 - control fee so the first
14:05 - changing to the second
14:09 - second second
14:13 - value equals
14:16 - second number
14:20 - hmm please it's ready
14:29 - if first value it will equals into
14:33 - second
14:39 - then print
14:48 - first value
14:51 - equals
14:55 - which is integer first
15:00 - value you can copy and
15:04 - paste this one to just change the first
15:07 - and two
15:10 - seconds
15:14 - we just need to do this into a second
15:20 - yeah here let's
15:23 - change into a second
15:34 - first
15:37 - value plus second
15:41 - value
15:47 - then
15:52 - print
15:55 - some
16:06 - plus
16:10 - whoopsies over here
16:14 - string
16:19 - oopsies tr
16:23 - sum we need to put this into string but
16:26 - if we don't have the string it's a
16:28 - integer because this is a string two
16:31 - let's
16:32 - save it
16:36 - and then run it
16:40 - first number b-o-b
16:44 - value is not a number see if it's
16:48 - not a number it will stop
16:52 - so let's do it again first number 56
16:57 - second number 45
17:01 - sum 101
17:05 - next one it will be just like this one
17:09 - so
17:10 - first we just need to
17:13 - change so now
17:16 - just the last one is like this one
17:20 - so we just need to delete this
17:24 - code here first delete this
17:28 - and this then this
17:31 - then this then change over here
17:38 - it will be first value first
17:42 - value is then over here
17:46 - or oopsies
17:51 - or
17:52 - [Music]
17:55 - second
17:58 - value
18:01 - dot is
18:06 - is
18:10 - murrick
18:28 - and this will be the other code so let's
18:31 - save it
18:31 - so over here it will check if one of
18:34 - them is bob
18:36 - or not a number it will stop
18:39 - so let's go first number
18:42 - bob second number it will
18:46 - won't stop until um we type the second
18:50 - number
18:51 - second number six
18:54 - if value is not number because first
18:57 - number is not a ball
18:58 - is a not a number it's bob
19:02 - so let's do it with 33
19:06 - bob this will
19:10 - happen too so let's do first number 78
19:14 - second number 90 it equals
19:20 - 168 that worked
19:22 - and thanks for watching remember to
