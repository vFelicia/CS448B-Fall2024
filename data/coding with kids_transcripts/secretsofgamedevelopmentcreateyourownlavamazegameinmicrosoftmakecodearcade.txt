00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're in microsoft make code
00:08 - arcade so this is a game i made called
00:11 - lava maze
00:13 - and right now the time running so let's
00:16 - stop it
00:17 - so we're gonna give you a sample how it
00:19 - works
00:20 - okay i hope i can get to the wall
00:23 - oops i'm good at this
00:27 - okay now let's tell you about the clip
00:30 - so you can go to javascript or python
00:32 - let's go to buffer first
00:34 - and javascript drop script doesn't have
00:38 - much code here
00:40 - okay now on start set my sprite to
00:45 - spread
00:45 - this kind of image
00:50 - a player then move the sprite
00:55 - buttons over here or the arrows on your
00:58 - computer
00:59 - then set title map which is the map
01:02 - over there to
01:06 - a lava maze with a water right there
01:08 - let's pause it
01:10 - and then camera follow sprites so the
01:13 - camera you'll always see where your
01:15 - sprite is coming
01:16 - this dark countdown 60 seconds we'll
01:19 - also place my sprite on top of random
01:21 - yeah so you but you won't go on top of
01:24 - the lava or the water
01:26 - you can go on the black yeah
01:29 - somewhere near the lava or maybe near
01:32 - the water
01:33 - then how you lose is
01:36 - that your sprite kind of player overlaps
01:41 - the lava
01:42 - then at any lava at location
01:46 - then game over at lose and place down
01:50 - power down until done neat
01:57 - you know that you lost so if the player
02:00 - touches the lava you lose
02:02 - yeah then on sprite of kind of
02:05 - player overlaps the water oh you're
02:08 - safe at location game over as wind
02:12 - when you press door when it can change
02:15 - or lose
02:15 - and you have no way of winning then play
02:19 - sound power up
02:27 - will you lose if the timer runs out yeah
02:30 - it will be much trickier if i set the
02:32 - timer
02:33 - into 20 seconds
02:38 - let's see if i will
02:41 - say i it's gonna
02:44 - be kind of hard without touching the
02:47 - lava
02:49 - before the timer runs out
02:53 - and going oh so close
02:56 - yeah when you it's like under 10 seconds
03:00 - that thing will blank i'm gonna win
03:02 - under 10 seconds 14
03:04 - 13 12 11 10
03:08 - 9 8 7 see it's blinking
03:11 - it's blinking because you need to pee
03:16 - faster
03:18 - i always press okay your turn angry
03:21 - i want to set it back to 60 seconds okay
03:27 - set it back to 60 seconds a little bit
03:29 - easier
03:30 - hey it's not here it's
03:33 - we're on start 60 seconds
03:38 - okay now i'm gonna play it will you
03:44 - success
03:57 - oh you're trapped yeah
04:01 - [Music]
04:05 - so sometimes you might go into my trap
04:08 - up there which you can't go because
04:12 - you're lava so i can fix that by going
04:16 - to the title map
04:17 - right here right here you can go to
04:21 - erased
04:23 - so about i think these two will be good
04:26 - and then when you spawn over here i
04:29 - don't think you're gonna spawn here
04:30 - you can just do but it might be kind of
04:34 - hard because there's a low chance you're
04:36 - gonna
04:36 - spawn there okay now let's do it
04:40 - you do it andrew you do it
04:44 - okay okay
04:47 - okay this is kind of easy because i
04:48 - remember the whole maze
04:51 - [Music]
04:52 - sometimes maybe you're too fast
04:57 - so i recommend you not too fast
05:00 - slowly a little bit steady
