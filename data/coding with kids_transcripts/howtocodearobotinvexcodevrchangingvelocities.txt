00:16 - turning speed of the
00:19 - robot program grid map okay let's first
00:24 - okay set drive speed
00:28 - to 100 its usual speed is
00:32 - 50. then drive forward
00:36 - for 100 millimeters

01:28 - 25 then turn left for 90 degrees
01:31 - then turn left
01:36 - for 90 degrees
01:39 - so drawing velocity to 30 percent
01:42 - dirty press now if you drive forward
01:45 - it'll be slower yeah then drive
01:49 - first so it'll drive backwards
