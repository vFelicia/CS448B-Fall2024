03:10 - switch back drop to w then wait one
03:12 - second
03:13 - and keep doing it until you do all the
03:15 - backdrops you can just switch it to the

04:12 - so over here it's pick one to ten
04:15 - seconds to create clone of myself

04:21 - so the robot can take longer to spawn
04:24 - yeah the
04:25 - uploaded robot yeah but
04:28 - this one from the usual thing
04:32 - will not because it's one two three
04:34 - while this is one to
04:35 - ten then pick random
04:39 - negative ten to negative 90. it's
04:42 - important
