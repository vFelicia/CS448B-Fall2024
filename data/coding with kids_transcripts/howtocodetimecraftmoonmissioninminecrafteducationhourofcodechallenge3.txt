00:01 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:07 - timecraft So today we're gonna select
00:10 - one and that's this one the space yeah
00:15 - that's our friend it's on the moon okay
00:18 - so that's it go to time paw and also
00:22 - this is our time agent
00:24 - Gremlin the green one
00:29 - I found a town time split where the
00:33 - Apollo 11 rock is stuck in orbit and
00:35 - will never make it to the moon we have
00:38 - to fix this travel to the canandi Space
00:41 - Center on July 16 1969 and get those
00:44 - astronauts to the Moon okay let's go so
00:47 - in the times like they never reach the
00:49 - moon yeah enter pot and press button
00:51 - press press button time jumping in three
00:54 - it's a picture
00:57 - Space Center Merritt Island Florida USA
01:00 - July 16 1969 NASA engineer they have
01:04 - just received a message from Apollo 11
01:06 - The Landing navigation data has been
01:08 - deleted how can we get the data back to
01:10 - them mathematician I've got the
01:13 - calculations to save the mission right
01:15 - here
01:16 - will have to manually send the landing
01:18 - navigation data and hope Apollo 11
01:20 - receives it a mathematician let's get to
01:23 - work here's how we reached them first
01:25 - 425 then turn right then for 17 and
01:28 - finally down three so now
01:32 - use your talk devices to help or your
01:34 - time agent into space follow the
01:37 - mathematician's instruction to deliver
01:39 - the navigation data to Apollo 11. so
01:42 - these are the this is the
01:44 - mathematician and this is the NASA
01:47 - engineer oh it's right up there and
01:50 - these are computers let's see the
01:52 - computer
01:54 - oh let's see it's like so cool in real
01:58 - Minecraft you won't find that I love
02:00 - that space Oh that's I think that's the
02:04 - spaceship yeah that's the spaceship okay
02:06 - use talk device it's the activity
02:12 - is out there just in time now that the
02:15 - time agent is in place let's use code to
02:18 - deliver the landing navigation data to
02:20 - Apollo 11 so they can safely land on the
02:22 - moon okay so it's a code we are having
02:26 - like a screen to see where um Apollo 11
02:29 - is send your agent to space module to
02:32 - deliver the calculations use the
02:34 - mathematician's calculations to
02:35 - determine how many moves the Asia must
02:37 - pick 425 write 17 and down three so we
02:41 - just have to do 425 right to 17. yeah
02:44 - this reached the Apollo 11 spaceship
02:47 - we're gonna do like the easy way to have
02:50 - like bicep like 25 so you don't have to
02:53 - do Asian move forward by 125. that is
02:56 - the long way yeah
02:58 - and like you have to do
03:01 - and then you need to do this 17 times
03:04 - yeah the first change it to White
03:08 - or else you'll just keep on moving
03:09 - forward yeah and I'll never reach this
03:12 - destination and then when you do down
03:15 - down three
03:17 - these are blocks yeah now let's run it
03:21 - because there's no repeat Loop in repeat
03:23 - Loop you can just do like
03:25 - um repeat 25 times and then just buy one
03:28 - faster still yeah two blocks yeah
03:39 - yeah NASA engineer thank you Apollo 11
03:42 - has received the data we did it as a
03:45 - team thank you everyone for your
03:47 - incredible work
03:49 - okay so congratulations Time Square
03:50 - repair so don't you disappeared wow I
03:53 - can teleport anyways rolling skills are
03:55 - Stellar you prepared this moon in time
03:57 - and the future space exploration is safe
04:00 - this is like so cool in here
04:05 - let's see where is here oh there's a
04:09 - library
04:10 - is it here on the first one there's like
04:12 - nobody here these they're pressure
04:14 - points yeah
04:16 - okay let's see there's nothing on the
04:18 - other computers you can jump right over
04:21 - here
04:22 - there's nothing here let's go to the
04:25 - last one I think it's in the last row
04:27 - yeah probably oh it's over there jump on
04:30 - the pressure plate
04:31 - press it press secret room where was it
04:35 - ah it's the library wow you found the
04:39 - secret room take note of which time HCC
04:41 - here and head back to the Institute okay
04:43 - see it's right here Rascal and Yeti it's
04:47 - always these two because they're always
04:49 - like so suspicious they all look so soft
04:51 - especially Rascal his name is literally
04:54 - Rascal yeah let's leave leave Mission
04:58 - time Jump it's still say bye bye bye oh
05:04 - okay we think Rascal Yeti
05:09 - Rascal okay so now we're gonna select
05:13 - well in another video we're going to
05:16 - select another time oh look look now
05:18 - there's the Apollo 11 and landed on the
05:21 - moon those little white things are
05:24 - humans yeah they're the astronauts they
05:26 - look so small they look like a Mangus
05:29 - see that's the head and that's the pack
05:33 - yeah that's what it's so like a manga
05:36 - yes except it's supposed to have some
05:38 - color right here except it doesn't yeah
05:40 - well the other one looks more yeah
05:43 - okay well that was fun and that's it for
05:47 - today thank you for watching Remember to
05:49 - smash that button and subscribe bye bye
