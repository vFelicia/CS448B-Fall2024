00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:03 - cleo mars
00:04 - today we're at minecraft education
00:06 - edition so we're in the hour of
00:08 - code the villagers and pilgers so the
00:10 - basic story is
00:12 - there are once two villages the villager
00:14 - villages
00:15 - and the pillager village so they
00:18 - both the both villages knew how to live
00:21 - in their own way but now they have
00:23 - separated
00:24 - so we're gonna do six quests to unite
00:27 - them so today we're going to introduce
00:29 - the ravager to the villagers
00:30 - so we're going to talk to this villager
00:33 - so this villager says ravagers are
00:35 - misunderstood creatures
00:36 - everyone in town is afraid of them but i
00:38 - learned that they can be friendly
00:40 - maybe if we bring this ravager around to
00:42 - meet a few villagers they might see how
00:44 - gentle
00:44 - they can be someone press next and
00:47 - the villager says have your agent
00:49 - introduce the waiver just to the free
00:51 - villagers standing near their house
00:53 - start activity and press the c
00:57 - so now the riveter is going to follow
00:59 - our agent so
01:00 - we can do the agent move and then the
01:02 - raven will
01:03 - follow and once we get to one of the
01:06 - villagers out
01:07 - out of their houses the they'll
01:09 - immediately introduce themselves so i'm
01:12 - going to do for i
01:13 - and range so now let's see how many
01:15 - blocks
01:16 - i'm going to go through this guy get
01:20 - okay so only one two
01:23 - three four five six seven eight nine
01:26 - so i'm gonna do a four i in range which
01:29 - will repeat
01:30 - the nine times we'll do agent move
01:34 - forward we can't do it backwards all
01:37 - right we'll move backwards next time
01:40 - forward
01:44 - so now we're going to run it let's see
01:49 - oh it's like the the river joins like
01:52 - sticks
01:57 - so now we introduce the researcher to
01:59 - this villager
02:01 - okay now when you count to that
02:05 - do one two three four five
02:08 - six seven eight nine ten eleven
02:11 - twelve so i'm gonna do twelve times
02:14 - and do twelve times before
02:18 - first and do agent
02:22 - dot move
02:26 - right okay let's see
02:31 - oops i'm gonna do two left
02:49 - let me do backwards
02:54 - agent dot move
02:58 - backwards and then we're going to delete
03:00 - this for now
03:06 - so now we're back on the path wait one
03:08 - more backwards
03:12 - so now when you go 12 block 12
03:15 - blocks for that villager
03:29 - change it two
03:32 - and then agent move backwards
03:36 - yes backwards
03:40 - and then we're back on the path when you
03:42 - do
03:44 - turn left so i'm going to do agent move
03:47 - left
03:47 - and 12 times
03:53 - so now so now there was like a
03:57 - little bit of far worse and now we
04:00 - introduce the ravager to the second
04:02 - villager now to the last
04:03 - villager move backwards
04:08 - how many times one two is nine i think
04:12 - it's nine so one change to 12
04:15 - to nine and change the left to backwards
04:19 - backwards they're always faced in one
04:21 - direction
04:26 - when you do two more
04:30 - do two more yeah step see where your
04:33 - just looks at the agent yeah
04:36 - two more steps we're going to change the
04:38 - nine to a two
04:41 - yay then the caretaker says the
04:44 - villagers have always been afraid of
04:45 - bravers based on the stories they had
04:47 - heard about them
04:48 - although they had never actually met a
04:51 - ravager their fear created a bias
04:52 - against the creatures
04:54 - so now the caretaker also says once the
04:57 - villagers saw
04:58 - that this ravager was gentle they
05:00 - started to rethink their
05:01 - opinions of them and realize that it is
05:03 - important to take the time to get to
05:05 - know someone
05:06 - before making judgments don't forget to
05:08 - go check on your tree
05:10 - showing a fast travel to the tree
05:14 - so now the tree is growing so the tree
05:17 - resembles
05:18 - the the villagers and pillagers going
05:21 - back together so now it's
05:22 - going pretty good and we have completed
05:25 - two quests before
05:26 - so we needed to do four more quests yeah
05:29 - well that was fun
05:31 - and that's it for today thank you for
