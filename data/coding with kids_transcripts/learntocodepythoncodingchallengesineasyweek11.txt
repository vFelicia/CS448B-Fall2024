00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - edible so edibin is a coding platform
00:07 - where you can do lots of different
00:09 - coding problems using different coding
00:12 - languages So today we're going to do
00:14 - three easy coding challenges and edit
00:17 - with python so our first coding
00:19 - challenge is called two makes ten our
00:22 - instructions are to create a function
00:24 - that takes two arguments both arguments
00:27 - are integers which are A and B return
00:30 - true if one of them is 10 or their sum
00:33 - is 10. so here for example they'll give
00:36 - us the the they will give us two numbers
00:39 - for example here's nine and ten so if
00:43 - uh the sum of both numbers is 10 or one
00:48 - of the numbers is 10 we're going to
00:49 - return true if not we're going to return
00:52 - false so here is 9 and 10 10 there's a
00:56 - 10 so we're going to turn true and here
00:58 - there is Nine and Nine
01:00 - um they equal to 18 and none of them are
01:03 - 10 so it's false yeah okay okay so now
01:06 - we have a function called makes 10 with
01:08 - two arguments which are A and B so first
01:11 - I'm going to do if a equals equals 10 or
01:15 - b equals equals 10 we're going to return
01:17 - true so here we're checking if uh if one
01:21 - of the numbers is 10 so we need to use
01:22 - two equal signs because you we don't
01:25 - want to assign something you just want
01:28 - to check if it's equal to we don't want
01:30 - to assign a to 10 or B to 10 instead we
01:33 - will check if a equals 10 or b equals
01:36 - ten yeah so if none of the numbers are
01:39 - 10 we're going to go to else if so else
01:42 - if the sum of A and B is 10 so a plus b
01:46 - equals equals ten we're going to return
01:48 - true so make sure you add two equal
01:51 - signs so if you know if the sum is not
01:55 - 10 and none of the numbers is 10 where
01:58 - new else return false
02:01 - okay
02:02 - next we're gonna check it and see the
02:04 - test cases so here there's ten and one
02:06 - there's a 10 so we're gonna turn true
02:08 - and there's a 12 and negative two so 12
02:12 - plus negative 2 is 10. so ordinary terms
02:15 -  okay so now let's go to the console
02:18 - and see all tests are passed
02:21 - so our next coding challenge is called
02:23 - movie theater admittance we have
02:26 - function that checks whether a person
02:27 - can watch it m a 15 plus rated movie one
02:32 - of the following two conditions is it
02:34 - require is required for admittance the
02:36 - person is either at least 15 years old
02:39 - or they have parental supervision so
02:42 - there's a parent to guide them the
02:44 - function is steps two parameters age and
02:47 - is supervised return of bullion so we're
02:51 - gonna either return true or false
02:53 - because these are bullions and yeah H is
02:57 - a decimal and is supervised is a bully
03:00 - okay so now we have a function called a
03:02 - set into movie you have two arguments
03:04 - called age and is supervised first we're
03:07 - gonna do if H is more or equal to 15
03:12 - we're going to return true because if
03:14 - the person is more or
03:17 - um equal to 15 years of age they can go
03:20 - in and just go without any problem yeah
03:24 - so if they are less than if they're not
03:27 - 15 years old yet we're going to go to
03:29 - else if so we're going to check if they
03:32 - have parental supervision
03:34 - so if there's a parent with them yeah so
03:36 - Elsa is supervised equals equals true
03:39 - Where to return true so I'll still make
03:42 - sure to add two equal signs
03:45 - so if there if is supervised is true
03:48 - that means there's a parent so they can
03:50 - go watch the movie else if they don't
03:52 - have a pair and there are less than 15
03:55 - years old we're going to do else return
03:57 - false that means they get kicked out
03:59 - with the movie here so you can't go in
04:02 - anyway because now it has cases it's
04:07 - 14.99999959 wow you just need like one
04:10 - more day until you're 15 years old but
04:12 - they're not still they're still not 15
04:14 - years old
04:16 - it says true but there's a parent told
04:20 - supervision so yeah true they can go in
04:23 - when they're 15. okay so then now
04:26 - there's also 16 so they're 16 years old
04:29 - even if they don't have parental
04:31 - supervision they can go in so if you
04:33 - have 16 and you still have parental
04:36 - Vision that means double check marks
04:40 - so we pass all the tests onto our final
04:43 - coding challenge it's called convert
04:46 - hours into seconds this can help you if
04:48 - you're mad
04:50 - so it's a very simple instruction for a
04:52 - function that converts hours into
04:54 - seconds for example here two hours
04:57 - equals 7 200 seconds so 60 seconds in a
05:02 - minute and 16 minutes in an hour okay so
05:05 - here is how you do it so we have a
05:08 - function called how many
05:09 - seconds with a variable called hours so
05:14 - we're just simply going to make a
05:15 - variable called seconds equals hours
05:18 - times three thousand six hundred so when
05:21 - you multiply by 3600 because we first
05:25 - turn it into a minute and then an hour
05:27 - but you can do that once by multiplying
05:29 - 60 times 60 which is 3600 and then do
05:33 - hours times uh 3600 to see how many
05:37 - seconds while making this code you still
05:39 - have to use math yeah so then we're
05:42 - going to return seconds
05:44 - and now let's see test cases how many
05:48 - seconds 24 hours which is in a day
05:50 - there's 86 and 400 seconds loud that's a
05:55 - lot of seconds yeah in 10 hours there is
05:59 - 36
06:01 - 000 just add a zero to one hour yeah
06:04 - okay so all tests are passed well that
06:07 - was fun and that's it for today thank
06:10 - you for watching Remember to smash the
