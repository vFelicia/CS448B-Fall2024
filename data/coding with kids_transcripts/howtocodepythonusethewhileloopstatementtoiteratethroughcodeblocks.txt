00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:02 - is
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're going to
00:05 - teach you python so today we're going to
00:07 - learn about iterating in python
00:09 - so first we're going to do import random
00:12 - so import will tell
00:14 - python you're using a module so random
00:16 - is a module
00:18 - that is built into python and in
00:21 - another video we told you how to use
00:25 - modules from the python standard library
00:28 - so random is in the python standard
00:30 - library
00:30 - so it's built into python so then we're
00:34 - going to do
00:35 - rule equals zero so rule is the number
00:38 - you
00:38 - rolled so we're going to make a dice
00:40 - rolling game
00:41 - it's a variable yeah then we're gonna do
00:44 - count equals zero so count will keep
00:47 - track of how many times you rolled the
00:49 - dice
00:50 - then we'll do wall roll
00:54 - five well not when while roll
00:58 - is not five then count
01:01 - equals count plus one so it's adding one
01:04 - to the variable count because you rolled
01:07 - one time
01:08 - then roll random dot random one
01:11 - five so you can row one
01:14 - or two or three or four or five yeah so
01:18 - random is a function inside random and
01:21 - it will pick
01:21 - a number or an integer from one to five
01:25 - yeah then we're going to do print
01:28 - rule so it'll print the number rule
01:32 - rules so like you'll have a number from
01:35 - one to five
01:36 - then print a string so you can
01:40 - put the variable count in there it took
01:43 - count rolls to row of five so that's how
01:45 - many times you ruled
01:47 - to roll the five if the
01:50 - it printed a number that's not five then
01:53 - it'll repeat the while loop
01:54 - until it prints a five yeah
01:58 - okay let's save it with ctrl s and then
02:00 - go to the terminal and type
02:03 - while p y wall dot
02:11 - okay then it says five it took one rules
02:15 - to roll
02:16 - a five let's do that again okay up arrow
02:20 - to
02:20 - copy when you last typed in a terminal
02:24 - five it took one roll to roll a five
02:27 - again three five it took two rules to
02:31 - roll a five
02:33 - so now we know it worked because first
02:36 - it
02:37 - did two times five now it did
02:40 - three five now it we know it works
02:43 - because it wrote three then five again
02:45 - then it took two rows to roll five yeah
02:48 - let's try one more time
02:50 - it says four five it took two rules to
02:53 - rule a five
02:54 - i always do five it has two
02:58 - okay now we're gonna make the version
03:01 - two
03:01 - of our dice rolling game and it's gonna
03:06 - have better yeah i'm just gonna have
03:09 - player names okay then we're gonna
03:12 - do before the wild rule is not five
03:15 - we're gonna do print first person to
03:17 - rule five wins
03:18 - so that's like the instructions
03:22 - so it tells you how to win then
03:25 - we're gonna do after the while rule
03:28 - is not five then name equals name is
03:31 - another variable
03:33 - that has your name input so you can type
03:36 - your answer
03:36 - enter a name or queue to quit
03:39 - i won't quit so after it prints
03:43 - enter a name or queue to quit you can
03:46 - type
03:46 - a name yeah but right now we don't have
03:49 - the code for
03:50 - cube yeah then we do if name
03:53 - equals two q that means if you type q to
03:57 - the question enter a name or queue to
03:59 - quit you type q
04:01 - it will do break and then it will go
04:03 - down
04:05 - to print
04:08 - you roll count times
04:11 - so it will skip and
04:14 - go out of the while loop then we're
04:17 - going to do else
04:18 - after a print f name world
04:22 - rule so print f name
04:25 - f string name word rule well like for
04:28 - example if i take bob as the name
04:31 - then i'll do bob ruled
04:34 - for example free and then
04:37 - if it's still number five it'll go to
04:45 - wins if it is a five it'll do
04:49 - bob wins if bob ruled five
04:53 - then after that you'll go to printf
04:57 - string you will dice count times so i'll
05:00 - also print you rule the dice count
05:02 - times if you pressed q that means quit
05:07 - and then save it and go to here
05:10 - and do p1 wall dot py so first person to
05:14 - roll
05:14 - five wins that's an instruction enter a
05:17 - name or cue to
05:18 - quit andrew
05:22 - enter world one okay
05:25 - your turn type kalia
05:30 - leah clear roll the two enter name look
05:33 - you to quit
05:36 - okay
05:50 - you rolled the dice four times and we
05:53 - didn't get a
05:54 - five so it did not say who won because
05:57 - no one rolled the five i just typed quit
06:00 - and then it says you rolled the dice
06:03 - four times let's do it again
06:04 - first person to rule five okay i can do
06:08 - a for you what about
06:11 - five a win dice one time
06:16 - a a
06:33 - tomorrow four again clear
06:37 - clearly
06:40 - i will die six times
06:44 - okay now we're finally gonna make our
06:47 - third version the last version
06:51 - okay so let's do after the name
06:54 - and put enter name or queue to quit
06:57 - it'll check
06:58 - if you typed a space yeah if you typed
07:02 - no matter how many spaces you type it'll
07:04 - strip
07:05 - we use the strip function to remove all
07:07 - the empty spaces and then
07:10 - if you just typed a bunch of spaces then
07:13 - it'll remove all spaces that means you
07:14 - type
07:15 - nothing and then it will continue which
07:18 - means it will restart the while loop
07:20 - again so you um type that name
07:23 - yeah so it will print enter a name or
07:25 - queue to quit again
07:26 - because you basically type nothing so
07:29 - after that you
07:30 - will do if name dot strip equals q break
07:34 - so it's just like the other code
07:36 - checking if name equals
07:37 - q so if name got stripped so we added
07:41 - the strip
07:41 - function then it'll do
07:44 - that means it'll do quick so it'll break
07:47 - so go all the way to
07:49 - you roll the dice count times so let's
07:52 - save it
07:53 - and run it so first person to rule five
07:57 - wins enter name or
07:58 - queue to quit i'm gonna do andrew
08:02 - andrew world one space so
08:05 - it says enter a name or q to quit again
08:08 - because
08:08 - you rarely type nothing yeah because
08:12 - remove the space we cleared a bunch of
08:15 - spaces
08:16 - i guess do enter it does it again
08:19 - because how
08:19 - many spaces do you do you still need to
08:22 - at least type one letter onto it
08:24 - continue
08:25 - yeah okay rule two okay let's do
08:28 - bobby bobby five
08:32 - bobby wins my bobby you hold the dice
08:36 - three times
08:37 - so if you type a space it doesn't count
08:40 - as
08:40 - when you roll the dice because it
08:43 - continues so
08:44 - enter a name or q to quit did not do
08:47 - count
08:48 - equals count plus one okay one more time
08:54 - okay let's do andrews
09:00 - your turn okay
09:03 - okay two next
09:06 - tommy when well tommy
09:09 - thomas
09:14 - larry ladies roll
09:18 - five lettuce wins you roll the dice four
09:22 - times that you ticked us four times to
09:24 - do lattice
09:26 - yeah that is one letter so
09:29 - lucky girl why doesn't it do
09:32 - kania or andrew
09:48 - okay that's not how you spell with me i
09:50 - press enter too fast
09:52 - okay and that's it yeah and that's it
09:55 - for today
