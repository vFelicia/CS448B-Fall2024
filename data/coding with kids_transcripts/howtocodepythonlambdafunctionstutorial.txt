00:00 - welcome to creating with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:05 - python so today we're going to learn
00:07 - about
00:07 - lambda functions so lambda function is a
00:11 - small annoyance function
00:13 - so a lambda function can have any number
00:15 - of arguments
00:16 - but can only have one expression so why
00:19 - use a lambda function instead of a usual
00:22 - function
00:23 - well you can get the the power out of
00:26 - lambda functions when you put it inside
00:28 - a regular function
00:30 - so first we're going to do a usual
00:32 - function
00:33 - so when this is how to write
00:36 - uh lambda functions so first you have
00:39 - the name
00:40 - equals lambda the word lambda then the
00:42 - parameters
00:44 - and then the expression so this is the
00:47 - regular function
00:48 - so we're going to do def which is to
00:49 - find hello then there's a parameter
00:52 - x then return hello plus x
00:55 - i want to run that function print hello
00:58 - then world so the x is the world
01:02 - then it will return hello plus x and x
01:04 - is world so print hello world so i'm
01:06 - going to save it
01:08 - to the hello world going to do it in
01:12 - the lambda way so we're going to do
01:14 - hello one
01:16 - equals lambda x so is the parameter then
01:19 - hello
01:19 - plus x so that's the expression so we're
01:22 - going to print
01:22 - hello one then world as x
01:26 - so let's see if it also prints hello
01:27 - world so they both did hello world
01:30 - next i'm going to also do a function
01:33 - just like this one
01:34 - but i can it will be like the lambda
01:37 - function
01:37 - because it will be one line so we're
01:39 - gonna do def hello to
01:42 - x return hello plus x and all we're also
01:45 - going to do print
01:46 - hello to world so i'm going to save all
01:49 - three of them do hello
01:50 - so now there's free hello world so right
01:53 - now we have three ways
01:55 - to use functions to print hello world
01:58 - yeah so i'm gonna do greeting
02:01 - so i'm gonna do the lambda function
02:03 - equals lambda
02:04 - great name so now there's two arguments
02:08 - i mean two yeah two parameters and green
02:11 - plus then space plus name so we're gonna
02:14 - do
02:14 - print grading and the great will be how
02:18 - are you doing and the
02:19 - name will be andrew so greet
02:23 - then space andrew so to do how are you
02:25 - doing space
02:26 - andrew um right
02:29 - say that how are you doing then there's
02:31 - space andrews that worked
02:33 - i'm going to do define multiply and this
02:37 - is the original function
02:38 - i'm going to return lambda
02:41 - a and a times n so now we are gonna
02:46 - we are placing a lambda function inside
02:48 - a regular function
02:50 - so now there are two parameters
02:54 - one for the regular function one for the
02:55 - length so how do we fill
02:57 - both of them out at the same time so we
03:00 - need to
03:00 - fill out the parameters in different
03:02 - times i'm going to do double
03:04 - which is a variable equals then we'll do
03:06 - the
03:07 - function multiply two so we're filling
03:09 - up n
03:10 - as two then we're going to do triple
03:13 - equals multiply
03:14 - three then we're gonna do
03:23 - 11. so now it's gonna supposed to be
03:26 - print
03:26 - 22 and 33. so did 22
03:30 - and 33 so this worked and this draws out
03:33 - the power of the lavender function
03:35 - well that was fun and that's it for
03:38 - today
03:39 - thank you for watching remember to smash

03:44 - bye bye
