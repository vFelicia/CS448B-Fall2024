00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:06 - edible edible is a coding platform where
00:08 - there are lots of different problems you
00:09 - can solve using different coding
00:11 - languages So today we're gonna do three
00:14 - easy coding challenges and add a bit
00:17 - using python so our first coding
00:19 - challenge is called recursion to repeat
00:22 - a string and number of times
00:25 - so our instructions are to create a
00:27 - recursive function that takes two
00:29 - parameters and repeats the string n
00:31 - number of times the first parameter txc
00:34 - which is text is a string to be repeated
00:37 - and the second parameter is the number
00:39 - of times the strings to be repeated so
00:42 - for example here we have two variables
00:44 - first is a string
00:46 - so here in this case it's a b and then
00:49 - number three so the number is how many
00:52 - times we need to repeat the string and
00:56 - here a b a b a b okay so the second
01:00 - parameter of the function is always a
01:02 - positive integer so first we have a
01:05 - function called repetition with two
01:07 - parameters text and N so first we're
01:10 - going to create a variable called repeat
01:12 - which is a which has an empty string
01:15 - today we're going to do if n equals
01:17 - equals one and we're going to return
01:19 - text so when make sure to repeat two
01:21 - equal slot uh do two equal signs because
01:25 - then it'll actually mean equal not like
01:27 - in variables where you will only assign
01:29 - something
01:31 - so if n equals one we're just going to
01:33 - return the original text because we
01:35 - don't need to repeat it so then we're
01:38 - basically going to do this to all the
01:40 - numbers but it's going to be different
01:41 - from one so else if n equals equals two
01:45 - we're gonna do we're gonna assign repeat
01:48 - to be Text Plus text so here we
01:51 - basically do two texts and put them
01:54 - inside the variable repeat then we will
01:57 - return repeat so if these if the first
02:01 - if and else if so uh don't work so if
02:04 - like n is not one or two it will keep
02:07 - going down the if
02:09 - so else if n equals three we're gonna
02:12 - keep doing it make sure to add the add
02:14 - one more text each time and change the
02:16 - number and then all the way to four and
02:19 - then five
02:21 - five times the return repeat
02:24 - so now let's check it and see this test
02:26 - console so there is soccer and two times
02:29 - so soccer soccer then there is more 3ab
02:34 - which is a b a b a b so in the console
02:37 - we got all the tests passed onto our
02:39 - next coding challenge so our next coding
02:42 - challenge is called smash Factor smash
02:45 - factor is a term in golf that relates to
02:47 - the amount of energy transferred from
02:49 - the club head to the golf ball the
02:52 - formula for calculating smash factor is
02:54 - ball speed divided by Club speed
02:56 - create a function that takes ball speed
02:58 - which is BS and Club speed CS as
03:01 - arguments and Returns the smash factor
03:03 - to the nearest hundred so all we have to
03:07 - do is basically divide the BS variable
03:10 - by the Cs variable and then round it to
03:14 - the nearest hundredth which is two
03:15 - decimal points
03:17 - so
03:18 - first we have a function called smash
03:20 - factor with BS and CS so first I'm going
03:23 - to put the formula for smash factor in
03:26 - it which is ball speed divided by Club
03:29 - speed so now that we so now we have the
03:32 - smash Factor inside our variable SF so
03:35 - then we need to round the variable so
03:38 - we're going to do a variable called
03:40 - rounded equals round sf2 so round is a
03:44 - function which you can use to round
03:46 - numbers to whatever digits place to the
03:50 - hundredths place has two decimal points
03:52 - so we're going to put the two here and
03:54 - what we want to round over here which is
03:56 - our variable SF so now that we have our
03:59 - rounded uh smash Factor inside our
04:02 - variable around it we're going to return
04:03 - the variable rounded and now we're going
04:05 - to check and see the test console if you
04:08 - there are lots of numbers so 218 plus
04:12 - 161.2 is
04:14 - 1.34 which is rounded
04:17 - and then there's also 209.7 and 164.3
04:23 - divide that and you get 1.28 which is
04:25 - also rounded to the nearest hundredth
04:27 - place so we pass all their tests onto
04:30 - our final coding challenge this it's
04:33 - called is the dictionary empty so this
04:36 - can be very simple I'm but it can also
04:39 - be very useful so instructions are
04:41 - basically right so it is useful and easy
04:44 - yeah so write a function that returns
04:46 - true if the dictionary is empty and
04:48 - false otherwise so here for example here
04:52 - they give us an empty dictionary so
04:54 - we're going to return true if there's
04:56 - anything in the dictionary we return
04:57 - false
04:59 - so first we have function called is
05:01 - empty with a dictionary so first we're
05:04 - going to check the dictionary is blank
05:07 - so here it's an empty dictionary so I
05:10 - also remember to do the two equal signs
05:13 - not assigning something so then if it is
05:17 - empty we're going to return true else
05:19 - we're going to return false you can also
05:21 - do this to the list but you have to
05:22 - change the brackets and now let's check
05:25 - it
05:26 - and do the test cases so here
05:29 - there's Z2 W4 and y5 so there are keys
05:34 - and values so there are things in the
05:36 - dictionary so it's going to be false and
05:40 - empty dictionary is true so we pass all
05:43 - our tests well that was fun and that's
05:46 - it for today thank you for watching
