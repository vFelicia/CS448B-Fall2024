00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:06 - python so today we're going to use the
00:08 - while loop to make a simple game so our
00:10 - game is going to be a number guessing
00:12 - game so he tries to guess the correct
00:14 - number so first we're going to do import
00:17 - random so import whatsapp platform using
00:20 - module and random is our module so
00:24 - random is a built-in module and
00:27 - a module is basically a code file with
00:29 - functions
00:31 - so remember to put import at the top of
00:33 - all your code then we'll do
00:36 - value which is a variable equals
00:39 - random.random15 so why do we need the
00:41 - random random dot randy so rand is a
00:45 - function
00:46 - we need
00:47 - random.randit because render is a
00:50 - function that's inside the module random
00:52 - that's why we're using the module random
00:55 - so rand that will pick
00:57 - a num a random number between one and
01:00 - five and i'll store that number inside
01:02 - the variable value then we'll do count
01:05 - equals zero so count is a variable
01:07 - that'll keep track of how many
01:09 - tries you took to guess the correct
01:11 - number
01:12 - and then finally we're gonna do guess
01:15 - equals zero so guess is the number you
01:18 - guessed the correct number is then well
01:21 - guess exclamation mark
01:23 - equals value that mean
01:25 - exclamation mark equals is not so while
01:28 - guess is not valued that means while you
01:31 - guess incorrect then you'll count plus
01:35 - equals one so add one to count
01:38 - this will do the same as count equals
01:41 - count plus one so we're adding count to
01:43 - what count
01:45 - we're adding once account because it's a
01:48 - term
01:49 - and then guess so now we're assigning
01:51 - guess the variable equals input guess
01:54 - the number between one and five so the
01:57 - code will ask you the question guess a
01:59 - number between one and five and
02:01 - whatever your answer is will be stored
02:05 - inside the guess variable then we want
02:07 - to do
02:08 - if guess dot is numeric
02:11 - so as numeric is a function that will
02:14 - check if
02:15 - our guess function
02:17 - i mean guess variable is a number
02:21 - so then
02:23 - it is a number your guess equals into
02:25 - guess so turn
02:27 - your guess into an integer if you type
02:30 - bob to the question guess the number
02:32 - between one and five
02:34 - it'll
02:35 - go all the way back to the while again
02:38 - and it'll print guess a number between
02:41 - one and five and that'll count as a term
02:44 - if you did a number it would end
02:47 - the number and goes to wall and then if
02:49 - you
02:50 - do the correct number it'll go through
02:52 - the else in the while loop and then
02:54 - you'll print f string you guessed it and
02:56 - count tries and in the count it'll do
02:59 - the number
03:00 - coming tries you then you can do the
03:04 - the number yeah let's save it but
03:06 - control s go to terminal and type p y
03:10 - while game dot p y and run so it says
03:14 - guess a number between one five
03:29 - [Music]
03:30 - when you get all the numbers until we
03:32 - get yeah let's do it one more time so
03:34 - you can use your up arrow to copy what
03:36 - you last typed in the terminal
03:38 - so let's see let me guess
03:41 - five okay you guys my turn my turn
03:45 - one no
03:48 - no two
03:50 - two
03:51 - yes
03:52 - four
03:54 - i almost guessed free one more time
03:58 - five of you guesses four nope i guess
04:02 - two nope oh
04:04 - it is it's two again
04:06 - so i guess it's a random number why does
04:10 - it never get five but it will one time
04:14 - okay it worked
04:16 - so now we're gonna make our version two
04:19 - so
04:20 - after there's a guess equals zero we're
04:22 - gonna do print guess a number between
04:24 - one and ten so it's telling you the goal
04:27 - also in the randit we need to do it pick
04:30 - a random
04:31 - number from one to ten not one and five
04:34 - it's hardly because it's one to ten but
04:36 - the last one is one two five yeah so
04:39 - there's more numbers to guess
04:41 - then after the account plus one that
04:43 - means it has one's account you're gonna
04:46 - assign guess in a different way so print
04:49 - a different thing so guess equals input
04:51 - is still what you type in guess it's
04:53 - still what you type it it'll print
04:56 - f string enter guess
04:58 - number so it'll tell you
05:00 - the guess you're on like how many tries
05:03 - right now you took then
05:05 - after if guest is numeric
05:07 - we'll do else that means if you type
05:10 - bulb or
05:11 - something that is not a number it will
05:13 - go to else
05:14 - and it'll do
05:16 - print numbers only please so you'll
05:18 - print numbers only please just telling
05:20 - you don't type something that's not a
05:22 - number and then it'll continue so skip
05:25 - all the other colors by going to show
05:28 - you below here and it'll print enter
05:32 - guest number count again then
05:35 - after
05:36 - this we're going to do another if so
05:39 - if you
05:40 - type the number into your number and
05:43 - then go to if the other if
05:46 - so if guess is more than value then
05:49 - it'll print your guess is too high try
05:51 - again so now we're getting clues
05:53 - then
05:54 - lf if it is not too high if it's lower
05:58 - than value that means lower than the
06:00 - correct number it'll print your guess is
06:02 - too low try again so now
06:05 - [Music]
06:06 - all the way to the while loop and then
06:09 - you'll print enter guess
06:11 - number would count then
06:14 - if you do correct
06:15 - it will continue it'll end your guess
06:19 - and then you'll pass the
06:21 - if because it doesn't match the first if
06:25 - or the second so go to
06:29 - the while again and then check but your
06:32 - number is the value so go all the way to
06:34 - the else and print you guessed it and
06:36 - count try so let's save it and run it
06:41 - i'm going to guess number one
06:44 - seven
06:44 - too high your turn five
06:48 - oopsies
06:50 - again your guess is too hard try again
06:52 - two two two low
06:56 - three three
06:58 - you guessed it in five trolls
07:02 - yeah but we just free
07:06 - again
07:07 - i guess all the guesses okay
07:11 - eight too high five too high two
07:14 - too low three two three four
07:18 - four no
07:20 - okay five tries let's see if khalid
07:24 - too high four
07:26 - oh no two trolls
07:43 - eight oh no four tries
07:46 - one more two depends unlock
07:50 - six you six oh
07:53 - one truck one truck
07:56 - [Music]
08:03 - it says numbers only please and then it
08:05 - printed enter guest number two that
08:07 - can't get one game
08:10 - [Music]
