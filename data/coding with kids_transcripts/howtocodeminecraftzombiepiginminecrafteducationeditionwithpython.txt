00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:05 - education edition and we're going to do
00:08 - a tutorial called zombie pigs it says
00:11 - you just want me to spawn zombie pigs
00:14 - start tutorials did you know
00:17 - pigs turn into zombies when they are hit
00:19 - by lightning let's see
00:20 - it happens the picture is a zombie
00:23 - pigmen
00:24 - yeah i don't use it to run the code when
00:26 - players swings
00:27 - and iron shovel so um
00:31 - i am used and then
00:34 - put encoder spawn okay five blocks away
00:37 - from the player
00:39 - so spawn okay piggy
00:45 - five zero zero so it'll be five blocks
00:47 - away from the player
00:50 - use code to spot a lightning bolt at the
00:52 - same price
00:54 - position you spawn depends so the the
00:58 - lightning will zab the pig
01:03 - not an animal spawn projectile
01:07 - let's see there is well that's a lot
01:17 - same position as our pig yeah

01:52 - range five so i repeat five
01:54 - times mobs dot spawn peak position five
01:57 - zero zero
01:58 - and then mobs dot spawn lightning ball
02:00 - in the same position
02:01 - in a player that on item interactive
02:03 - when you interact with the iron shovel
