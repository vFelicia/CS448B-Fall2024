00:35 - we need to walk two steps more forward
00:41 - yeah so let's get dragged two more move
00:43 - forwards here
00:47 - yes so we can because in here when you
00:50 - destroy the bottom block of a tree
00:52 - you destroy the whole tree and you're
00:54 - gonna work
00:56 - that kind of tree yeah so let's run it
00:59 - and see if it works go go
01:02 - go i think it's
01:06 - that easy and minecraft to destroy a
01:08 - trunk
01:13 - is the most common one yeah so let's
01:17 - do turn left
01:20 - yeah and then move forward
01:26 - so you can get to the tree and then
01:28 - destroy
01:29 - it quick quite quick
01:33 - yes we need to destroy the tree for our
01:36 - house
01:37 - to clear and
01:40 - build yep and the store block and then
01:44 - you can finish it
01:46 - finish this yeah to finish
01:50 - getting all the wood and next is the
01:53 - guilty house
01:55 - wait destroy block finally the final
01:59 - tree yeah it worked
02:06 - press continue
02:10 - next we're going to do every house
02:11 - starts with a wall build the first part
02:13 - of your house by putting the place
02:15 - and move forward commands inside the
02:17 - repeat loop
02:19 - so right here we have the one run repeat
02:22 - four times
02:22 - do so now we have a loop that will do
02:25 - something and here it will do something
02:28 - four times
02:29 - so steve or the instructions say when
02:32 - you build our first wall
02:34 - which is four blocks so let's do place
02:37 - birch plants or whatever block you want
02:40 - let's see what block
02:42 - okay the blocks that you
02:45 - punched down so yes i'm going to go
02:48 - spurs so here
02:51 - we only just place it four times so
02:53 - we'll have a straight tower
02:56 - so let's see what that does no so that's
02:58 - okay after we place the spurs flanks we
03:00 - need to move forward
03:01 - so we can make a proper wall not a tower
03:05 - let's run it so place then
03:08 - move forward four times
03:12 - we made our first wall yay
03:17 - let's press continue
03:21 - instructions say build the rest of your
03:23 - house from any material you'd like
03:25 - the command will come in handy so now we
03:28 - can build it with any
03:30 - material we'd like
03:33 - so we already have our wall
03:36 - and we need to build our house
03:39 - so let's do
03:43 - this let's do
03:47 - repeat three times again to do
03:51 - move forward
03:55 - and place birch planks
03:58 - or maybe another kind of wood
04:02 - to make a square square is the most
04:04 - simple house
04:05 - yeah let's turn the birch to
04:10 - oak no how a birch the first one
04:14 - two spurs like it's a wall
