00:01 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're a
00:05 - minecraft education
00:07 - and we're gonna go to the tutorials and
00:16 - we're going to do
00:16 - super digger so as the picture and name
00:20 - shows you
00:20 - you know that this will enable you to
00:23 - like super dig
00:24 - oh look at that dig through anything
00:27 - without
00:27 - holding it
00:31 - [Music]
00:42 - what will
00:43 - [Music]
00:47 - so you can like fill fill you can
00:50 - fill the blocks around you so if we fill
00:53 - air around
00:54 - if we fill the blocks with air around us
00:57 - then it
00:58 - will like that the blocks will disappear
01:00 - because we replace them with
01:02 - air which is not a block but like
01:05 - nothing
01:06 -  be from negative one negative one
01:11 - and negative
01:12 - one so the numbers are the ones are the
01:15 - places where you will fill the
01:18 - one fill these blocks and places with
01:21 - there and then next
01:24 - go to my and walk around don't fall in
01:27 - the void
01:28 - yeah because even if you are in creative
01:30 - mode if you fall to the board you'll
01:32 - eventually die
01:33 - oh look at that oh oh
01:36 - let me keep jumping okay go to the tree
01:40 - maybe i'll destroy the tree
01:43 - i know oh i think i got those right oh
01:47 - no
01:47 - yeah you stop moving it
01:51 - oh i think i'll
01:54 - [Music]

02:03 - [Music]
02:05 - let's see how can i go back up i don't
02:08 - know
02:09 - i need it let's just go back to code but
02:12 - i'm in this darkness
02:16 - i'm gonna keep going down don't fall in
02:19 - the void
02:20 - instead of running the code when the
02:22 - player walks
02:24 - when flying so fly
02:27 - so you like won't just just walk and you
02:30 - you know okay yeah
02:36 - and create a new world so we're saving
02:39 - next to this world which is completely
02:41 - black
02:42 - and we're going to create a new word to
02:44 - go into creative
02:46 - creative and then play so we can fly
02:50 - yeah because the creative you can fly
02:54 - that's lava pit okay but first we need
02:58 - to go to code
02:59 - and then press the super digger
03:02 - then we're to run it and press the run
03:04 - button
03:05 - now let's go forward fusum
03:12 - hello agent i'm going to
03:15 - go to a wall go to a wall see

03:51 - the agent needs to say go to
03:53 - minecraft.com
03:55 - no more falling into the board
04:01 - increase the volume now we need to
04:03 - change the ones
