00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - in mexico
00:06 - so today we want to learn about xy
00:08 - coordinates
00:09 - so first we need to drive forward so
00:12 - it's going to drive forward forever
00:15 - wait until okay
00:18 - don't wait until it's right there so
00:21 - wait until
00:23 - something is bigger
00:26 - that is bigger than zero so
00:30 - position when you first
00:33 - yeah position y
00:36 - is bigger than zero and millimeters
00:39 - is bigger than zero zero so
00:43 - now it's gonna drive forward until
00:46 - the y is more than zero so here
00:49 - the y is up and down so the middle is y
00:53 - we start from here so when we go
00:56 - here and we go straight up we go to
00:59 - more than zero then it's going to stop
01:02 - driving
01:03 - because it's going to turn right for 90
01:05 - degrees
01:06 - okay let's turn
01:10 - turn right for 90 degrees then drive
01:13 - forward
01:14 - so after it goes to
01:17 - y the y coordinate
01:21 - more than zero it'll turn right for 90
01:23 - degrees and drive forward
01:25 - and then it's going to drive forward
01:27 - then wait until
01:28 - wait until so after the y is
01:31 - more than zero it's going to turn right
01:33 - drive for and drive forward
01:35 - until wait until bigger the bigger one
01:39 - bigger than zero so the
01:42 - position in x in millimeters so the
01:45 - x-coordinate is more than zero
01:48 - then stop driving stop driving
01:52 - okay so now it's going to drive forward
01:55 - until
01:55 - the position in y is more than zero and
01:58 - then turn right for 90 degrees
02:00 - drive forward wait until position x
02:03 - more than zero and stop driving so we
02:06 - start here
02:07 - and it's gonna drive forward until
02:10 - it goes more than zero in y coordinate
02:13 - then it will turn right
02:14 - so his face this way in the x and then
02:17 - it will drive until
02:18 - it goes middle and then it'll stop so
02:20 - let's run it
02:23 - anyway
02:27 - okay let's do it in 2d mode first
02:30 - so it's gonna go forward
02:33 - until it goes to more than zero y
02:37 - so now it's moving forward and
02:41 - again now it's more than zero y
02:44 - is turn and down is zero zero so it's
02:48 - stopped
02:50 - let's go to 3d mode okay let's restart
02:54 - it first
02:54 - dance video because when you restart it
02:57 - it goes to t
02:58 - 2d mode let's run so now
03:02 - let's go forward until y is more than
03:05 - zero
03:06 - turn right and drive forward until x
03:09 - is more is more than zero so now
03:14 - yeah and thanks for watching remember to
03:17 - smash or like
03:18 - and subscribe bye
