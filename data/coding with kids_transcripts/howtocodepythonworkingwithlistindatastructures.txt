00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - going to teach you python so today we're
00:07 - going to learn about python
00:09 - so first we want to do colors equals
00:12 - then
00:12 - square brackets red green blue yellow
00:15 - orange purple brown
00:16 - so these are colors and they're strings
00:19 - so
00:20 - each item is separated by a comma in
00:24 - this list
00:25 - so colors is our list then we're going
00:27 - to do print colors so it's going to
00:29 - print
00:30 - the list with the square brackets and
00:32 - the columns
00:33 - next i'm going to do print type colors
00:37 - so type is a function that will print
00:40 - the data type
00:40 - of colors and a list can store
00:44 - any can have items that are any data
00:47 - type
00:48 - for example floats integers and strings
00:51 - so let's say you would with control s
00:53 - and go to the terminal and type
00:55 - p y list dot p y
00:59 - so it printed the list just exactly as
01:02 - we typed it
01:03 - and it said class list so colors
01:07 - class is a list because it's a list
01:10 - yeah next we're going to
01:14 - sun dry equals john 3.14
01:17 - 7 and false so sundra is our list and
01:20 - now we're going to see what happens if
01:22 - we have a list
01:23 - with items of different data types
01:26 - because john
01:27 - is a string three point fourteen is a
01:29 - float seven is an integer and false is a
01:31 - boolean
01:32 - so i'm gonna print the list and see if
01:34 - anything
01:35 - special happens and then we're gonna
01:37 - print type sundry so again we're using
01:39 - the
01:40 - function type which will tell us this
01:42 - type of syndra
01:43 - and we'll see if the type will change if
01:46 - the a list has um different
01:49 - data types in it so save it and you can
01:52 - use the up arrow to copy what you last
01:54 - typed in the turn
01:57 - it printed the list regularly and the
01:59 - class is still
02:00 - list so if you have a list with items
02:03 - that
02:04 - are have different data types is
02:07 - it is still a list yeah and it still
02:10 - prints the
02:10 - list regularly
02:14 - so now we're going to learn about how to
02:16 - create an empty list
02:18 - so first there's a name then space
02:20 - equals
02:21 - space so if you type anything before the
02:24 - e
02:25 - the equals then it's the name
02:28 - and then square brackets and then you
02:30 - type the items in the square
02:32 - in the square brackets but we're going
02:33 - to leave it empty
02:36 - so next we're going to do closure equals
02:39 - red green blue yellow orange purple and
02:41 - brown
02:41 - so this is our list and we're using it
02:43 - again next we're going to do
02:46 - print f string so you can put the item
02:49 - in the list and the print zero based
02:52 - indexing into the list dot dot second
02:55 - item
02:56 - then curly bracket colors straight
02:59 - brackets
03:00 - one so these items in the list have
03:03 - index numbers and the first item is
03:06 - always
03:06 - zero and then the second item is one so
03:09 - it will print
03:10 - zero based indexing into the list dot
03:13 - dot
03:13 - second item green and the last item can
03:17 - be whatever
03:19 - number it is or negative one next we're
03:22 - gonna do
03:23 - print f string last item the list and
03:26 - colors negative one so the last one
03:28 - can be negative one and it will
03:32 - be brown so it will print last item the
03:34 - list
03:35 - brown next we're gonna do print a string
03:38 - next to the last item in the list curly
03:41 - bracket colors
03:42 - negative two so you can also go the
03:44 - other way and
03:46 - red is still zero when you go the other
03:48 - way and negative two is purple because
03:50 - we're counting
03:52 - from brown to red so brown is negative
03:54 - one so purple is negative two
03:57 - so orange is negative three and uh goes
03:59 - on
04:00 - yeah so it's gonna print next to last
04:03 - item in the list
04:04 - purple so let's save it and go to
04:07 - terminal and
04:07 - run it so it did zero based
04:11 - and next thing into the list dot dot
04:13 - second item
04:14 - green it's true it's the second item
04:17 - yeah
04:17 - the last item in the list brown next to
04:21 - the last item in the looks purple
04:23 - so it all did the correct numbers or
04:26 - items in the list colors
04:30 - so next we're going to do
04:33 - colors equals red green blue so now we
04:36 - shortened
04:37 - the list colors next we're going to
04:39 - print colors
04:40 - free so there is no item that has the
04:44 - index number three because remember
04:46 - red is zero green is one and blue is
04:49 - two so now we're gonna try to print a
04:52 - item
04:53 - well uh index number that is not in the
04:56 - list and let's see what
04:58 - happens let's save it
05:01 - and run it so it did
05:04 - it had uh index error list index out of
05:08 - range so it's out of range because
05:11 - there is no free there's only zero one
05:13 - and two
05:14 - you need to add one more item to have a
05:16 - free for it to work
05:19 - so for it to work now we need to do a
05:22 - two
05:23 - one or zero yeah so next we're gonna
05:28 - have our list colors again it's all the
05:31 - colors
05:32 - i can imagine right now yeah so then
05:35 - print dash and which will tell the print
05:38 - to a new line
05:39 - so wrote print dash end but it'll have a
05:42 - new line and
05:44 - it'll tell the print have a new line and
05:46 - then it's going to print
05:47 - print the slice start at index 2 and
05:49 - exclude index
05:51 - five so we're gonna print colors two
05:54 - five so it's gonna print the items two
05:57 - it's a four but not
05:58 - five excluding index five
06:02 - yeah so if you have two numbers like and
06:04 - print the items in the list like this
06:07 - it will exclude the last item for
06:10 - example
06:11 - it will be here five and then we're
06:13 - gonna print type
06:14 - colors to five so we're gonna see what
06:17 - type
06:18 - of items in a list are so let's save it
06:22 - and run it to see what happens
06:25 - so it did print the slice starter and
06:27 - index 2 and excluded in s5
06:29 - blue yellow orange so it excluded index
06:32 - 5
06:33 - and purchase the items two three and
06:35 - four and then the class is still
06:37 - list even if not it is not the whole
06:40 - list
06:42 - next i'm going to do
06:46 - print dash n so new line again print a
06:49 - slice start at
06:50 - index 0 to index free then print colors
06:53 - then nothing then free so we have
06:56 - nothing because
06:57 - it's the first list well first item to
07:01 - the third item so this will print the
07:04 - third item because there's only one
07:06 - number here
07:07 - so let's test it save it and run it
07:11 - so it did print a slice starting at
07:13 - index 0 to index for
07:15 - red green blue it printed the first free
07:18 - index color yeah so
07:23 - and you can notice there is a new line
07:26 - next we're gonna do
07:28 - print that and so new line again print a
07:30 - slice starting index four to the end of
07:32 - the list
07:33 - print colors for and then nothing so it
07:36 - will
07:38 - print all from item four to the end of
07:42 - the list because remember
07:43 - that it won't exclude anything because
07:45 - there's only one number so let's save it
07:48 - and run okay let's see so orange purple
07:51 - and brown the last three colors
07:54 - yeah so it worked finally we're gonna do
07:58 - oops print dash and some new line
08:01 - print a slice from the fourth to the end
08:03 - but not the last item
08:05 - so we're gonna print colors negative
08:07 - four which is yellow because we're going
08:09 - this way now so it'll do yellow orange
08:12 - and purple
08:13 - so let's save it and run it
08:17 - so it did print a slice from the fourth
08:19 - to the end but not the
08:20 - last item yellow orange and purple
08:28 - so now we're going to use some list
08:31 - helper functions
08:32 - so let's have helper functions so first
08:35 - we're going to do
08:37 - yeah the colors list and we're undo
08:39 - colors.reverse so reverse is a list
08:42 - helper function
08:43 - and then we'll print colors so the
08:45 - reversed function
08:46 - list function will reverse the
08:49 - next yeah we'll reverse the items
08:53 - and then we'll print the colors to see
08:56 - how colors looks like when it's reversed
08:59 - so let's save it and run it
09:03 - so it's a brown purple orange yellow
09:05 - blue green red so it totally reversed
09:08 - the whole list
09:10 - so the next helper function
09:13 - list helper function we're going to use
09:15 - is sort so colors dot
09:17 - sort and then we'll print colors so the
09:20 - sort
09:21 - list helper function will sort the items
09:24 - in the list
09:25 - by alphabetical order so let's save it
09:27 - and run
09:29 - so i did blue brown green orange purple
09:33 - and red
09:34 - and yellow for the sort helper function
09:38 - yes yes so the first one was
09:41 - blue yeah but don't ask why
09:46 - brown is next why not brown is first
09:50 - because the second
09:51 - second letter is
09:55 - l and that's
09:58 - it for today thank you for watching
