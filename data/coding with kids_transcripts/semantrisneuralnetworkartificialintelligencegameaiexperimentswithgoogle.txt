00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to show you a google
00:07 - ai
00:07 - experiment for managers so
00:10 - the game was powered by machine learning
00:14 - it it was trained by looking at billions
00:17 - of conversations
00:19 - on the internet so let's play
00:22 - yeah and the ai learned how to predict
00:26 - which words are most related to the word
00:28 - you type in the game so let's see
00:31 - the arcade mode
00:34 - let's see how you can play it and how
00:36 - the ai does it
00:38 - so type the first thing that comes to
00:39 - mind when you think of horse
00:41 - so there's this blue arrow that
00:44 - points at as at a word
00:47 - and you need to type um a relating word
00:52 - mo and the ai will guess which word is
00:54 - most related
00:55 - and sort it out yeah and the most
00:58 - related words will go
00:59 - under here in the blue and if you get
01:02 - the
01:03 - if you get the blue word under the blue
01:06 - box then you get points
01:11 - pony is like the most related yeah
01:15 - so now you got points
01:20 - don't reach here or you will lose and
01:23 - you score points for moving the target
01:25 - behind uh
01:30 - so after the instructions
01:33 - you can't take a tooth yeah because i
01:36 - already have tooth teeth oops there's no
01:40 - h
01:41 - and then you spell a word wrong it'll
01:43 - also like try to predict which word
01:45 - you're trying to type
01:48 - well and after um you type like
01:51 - a many words under the line then if
01:54 - it'll
01:55 - like each two seconds it'll get words
01:58 - down
01:59 - coming down and it'll be harder so you
02:01 - need your typing speed
02:03 - and your thinking see it chair just came
02:06 - down
02:07 - sleep dark drunk
02:11 - darkness not oh sleep streak bonus
02:14 - sometimes you can get bonuses
02:16 - if you get the the word

03:19 - game over because it touched the red
03:21 - line oh well it's not red
03:23 - next let's go to black yeah block smoke
03:28 - block is a little bit easier yeah arcade
03:31 - yeah like everything is so hard and
03:33 - challenging it says think fast
03:36 - type fast so everything's fast if you
03:38 - have a good typing speed i recommend you
03:40 - to do arcade but if you don't
03:43 - think slow and just do the box blocks
03:47 - take your time and pull the lip out so
03:49 - let's get straight
03:51 - take your time people so here they're
03:54 - blocked like tetris
03:55 - and you can like type relative weather
03:58 - whether you should weather type
04:00 - something related to one of the words
04:01 - below your clue can be as long as you
04:03 - like
04:04 - right so if you can do the
04:08 - the word is most related to it will
04:10 - focus on
04:11 - one word and
04:16 - yeah and that word it will delete that
04:19 - word and turn into points
04:21 - yeah and it'll also delete the other
04:24 - blocks around it which are the same
04:26 - color and it's touching them
04:28 - it's a rain so this now let's see if the
04:31 - ai understands which block you're
04:33 - talking about
04:34 - let's do it so it did
04:38 - like but like it's there's still purple
04:41 - here
04:42 - oh yeah at least yeah the black and
04:46 - others connected by the same color are
04:48 - all turned into points it's all turned
