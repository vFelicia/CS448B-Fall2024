00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia
00:03 - and my name is andrew today we're going
00:05 - to teach you python
00:07 - we're in visual studio code and today
00:09 - we're going to learn
00:10 - branch coding so first we're going to do
00:13 - a new file
00:14 - i'm going to name it branch coding dot
00:17 - p1
00:18 - so first i want to make a value equals
00:22 - seven then if
00:26 - value equals we need two equal signs
00:30 - because one equal sign assigns something
00:33 - while two
00:33 - equals sign check if something equals
00:35 - something so
00:37 - if value equals seven
00:40 - you need a tab and then print
00:44 - value is
00:49 - wait
00:52 - my value is seven
00:55 - okay print
01:07 - okay now you press ctrl s to
01:10 - save what do you think it won't do i
01:13 - think
01:14 - it it will check if the value is seven
01:18 - then print
01:18 - value is seven then print finish i also
01:21 - think it too
01:22 - let's go to terminal and type p y
01:26 - branch coding
01:31 - dot p one let's say it's value of seven
01:35 - finished next we're gonna add else so
01:39 - else
01:42 - current
01:45 - the value is not
01:48 - seven now let's save it and what do you
01:52 - think it will do now
01:54 - well the value is equal seven so it will
01:57 - do the if
01:58 - it will print the value is seven
02:02 - okay let's change the value to
02:05 - six and save it now what do you think it
02:08 - will do
02:08 - i think it will skip the if then do the
02:11 - else print developers not 17 print to
02:13 - finish
02:14 - good now you can use the up arrow to
02:17 - copy what you last typed in
02:20 - since the value is not seven finished
02:23 - now we're going to add an alice
02:30 - oh this
02:38 - equals eight
02:43 - then i'm going to change the value to
02:46 - eight now save it
02:50 - and then
02:54 - do the end tab print
03:02 - the value is eight
03:06 - save it and now what do you think it
03:08 - will do if
03:09 - it will check if the value is seven if
03:11 - it's not
03:12 - um seven it will go to the elf then the
03:16 - value equals eight
03:18 - then it will print the vowel is eight
03:19 - descriptive
03:21 - else then go print finish i think so two
03:25 - let's do let's run it says the value is
03:32 - my goodness if clock
03:35 - blocks this is code block okay so first
03:38 - i want to do
03:39 - first that
03:42 - value equals
03:46 - true and then second
03:51 - second and u equals
03:55 - six goes six
03:58 - and then we're going to do f is first
04:02 - first
04:02 - value equals
04:06 - equals the first value
04:10 - in one minute
04:24 - got here we got here
04:28 - then print that here
04:31 - [Music]
04:40 - okay save it now what do you think it
04:44 - will do
04:45 - so the second number of value equals
04:48 - eight
04:49 - six i mean then it first back along
04:52 - first value equals nothing if
04:56 - second value equals eight six then print
04:59 - got here so i think the first value is
05:03 - true so
05:04 - that means it's basically meaning if
05:06 - true
05:07 - then it will do if second value equals
05:10 - six
05:11 - now print got here so i think it will
05:13 - just print got here
05:15 - this save it
05:19 - and then run it
05:22 - says got here and that's it for today
