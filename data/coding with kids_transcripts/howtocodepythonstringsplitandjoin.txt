00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:02 - is claire and my name is andrew today
00:04 - we're going to teach you python
00:06 - so today we're going to learn about
00:08 - string split and join so first
00:10 - we have msg which is message variable
00:13 - equals coding with kiss tutorial then
00:14 - there's a lot of spaces
00:16 - string split and joy and we have a
00:18 - second variable called
00:19 - oars equals emerald diamond collapsing
00:22 - iron which is a list of five fours
00:24 - from minecraft and there's the or list
00:27 - which is
00:28 - the list of the five cores so first
00:31 - we're going to do
00:32 - print list msg so it lists
00:36 - and makes our always list
00:39 - no it makes our msg into a bunch of
00:42 - letters
00:43 - so like there's a bunch of letters
00:45 - everywhere
00:47 - so then i'm gonna do
00:50 - print msg split
00:54 - so it splits
00:57 - our msg into words
01:00 - and there's no space that are here
01:04 - then we're gonna do print
01:08 - msg split then a space
01:12 - so now it includes the spaces that were
01:15 - not in the other
01:20 - then we're gonna play print type msg
01:24 - split
01:25 - so the type function is going to tell us
01:27 - the type of msc
01:28 - split so the class is
01:32 - list so msg.split the classes
01:38 - list
01:40 - print ores.split.com
01:44 - so it did the oars emerald diamond coal
01:47 - lapis and iron
01:51 - then print dash dot join or's list
01:56 - so so it did
02:00 - emerald dash diamond dash call dash
02:02 - lapis dash iron so it did
02:04 - dashes in between the orders
02:08 - and then we're going to do print dash
02:11 - dot join
02:12 - or list plus or is list so this time we
02:14 - did a plus always list
02:16 - so so it basically is the same as the
02:19 - last time except it repeated the list of
02:22 - ores
02:23 - so you can repeat it by doing the plus
02:27 - i'm going to do print then empty then
02:30 - dot
02:31 - join or list so
02:34 - it squished all the words together like
02:37 - they have no space
02:46 - then do print then empty again that you
02:49 - want msg
02:50 - split so it
02:53 - also did the same thing i squish the
02:56 - words together
02:58 - then we're going to do print msg replace
03:02 - this two empty this empty space with
03:06 - no no space so now we also squish the
03:10 - words together
03:12 - because it replaces these spaces with no
03:15 - space
03:16 - then we have the oars the oars
03:19 - variable again but with commas
03:22 - colon and the semicolon so
03:26 - then learn print comma join comma dot
03:29 - join or stop split
03:31 - semicolon dot split colon dot split
03:35 - com so that's a lot of splits
03:38 - so squish the words together all right
03:41 - oops
03:42 - me and save and then so did emerald
03:45 - diamond collapse and iron separated by
03:50 - by commas so remove the colon and the
03:53 - semicolon
03:55 - so another way to do this is to print
03:57 - replace
03:58 - or that replace the semicolon with comma
04:02 - and replace
04:02 - the colon with a comma split
04:06 - so let's say so it does the same thing
04:10 - as
04:10 - but it added the word replace that
04:14 - there is also no colon and no semicolon
04:18 - well that was fun and that's it for
04:20 - today
04:21 - thank you for watching remember to smash
