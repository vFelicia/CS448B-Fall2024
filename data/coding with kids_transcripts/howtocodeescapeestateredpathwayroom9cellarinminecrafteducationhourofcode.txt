00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:02 - Clea and my name is Andrew today we're
00:04 - in Minecraft education Edition in the
00:06 - hour of code Escape aay so in the last
00:09 - video we solved this room and now let's
00:11 - go into the
00:14 - portal bye Butler oh the butler's
00:16 - already
00:17 - gone okay let's see oh where are we okay
00:21 - let's see right click particles okay so
00:23 - the
00:25 - button oh seems like we have to go up
00:28 - there let's see
00:32 - staircase use a cursor to build a
00:33 - staircase to ACC access the upper level
00:36 - use move cursor to position the cursor
00:39 - and place block to place a block in the
00:40 - position you have selected you could go
00:43 - up down left and right so let's see the
00:46 - code
00:49 - example
00:51 - okay okay so let's go so you can use the
00:54 - loop too okay so I'll go up here so
00:57 - let's see what this does first
01:01 - okay so we could do parkour and just
01:05 - like add
01:07 - another thing over here so we could move
01:12 - and then um move
01:17 - [Music]
01:21 - cursor and then I up is orange so move
01:28 - cursor Orange
01:30 - [Music]
01:38 - oops okay let's
01:42 - see okay so now we can do parkour and
01:45 - just jump because we just need to go up
01:48 - to the next level okay puzzle soloft so
01:51 - now we have these wind currents that
01:52 - seem that can blow us
01:58 - off okay let's go to code so now I think
02:02 - we need to use our cursor to block the
02:04 - wind currents so Andrew is Right windy
02:07 - Bridge you need to get across the bridge
02:09 - but the wind is too strong you need to
02:10 - place blocks inside the holes and where
02:13 - the wind is coming from to block it okay
02:15 - so use the move cursor and the place
02:17 - block function let's do this example
02:23 - first okay so let's see um got over here
02:29 - moved yellow and then two more yellows
02:31 - and up one time okay so move yellow
02:34 - Place block and then move yellow two
02:37 - more times for Iron
02:40 - [Music]
02:45 - Range two times you could just do the
02:49 - like do it two times but like I we going
02:52 - to use the loop move
02:58 - cursor
03:01 - and then we're going to do
03:10 - yellow
03:15 - yellow two times and then we're going to
03:17 - move up one
03:20 - time um move
03:28 - cursor
03:31 - and then we're going to do orange since
03:33 - orange is
03:35 - up and then finally Place
03:41 - [Music]
03:48 - block okay so let's
03:51 - see so we're going to go we're going to
03:54 - block the first one block the second one
03:57 - and then after that we need block the
03:59 - the last one okay so after we're up
04:03 - there we'll have to go two times to
04:07 - yellow and then go down one time so this
04:10 - time I'm just going to do the two move
04:13 - cursor yellow commands because they're
04:16 - basically the same length as the repeat
04:20 - Loop if you do it two times then we're
04:23 - going to do the move cursor ping to go
04:27 - down and then we're going to place the
04:30 - block the
04:33 - [Music]
04:35 - block now we're
04:38 - going okay so cover the first
04:41 - [Music]
04:43 - hole and then the last hole the S so now
04:46 - there's something called a create
04:48 - minion oh so so I think we need to help
04:51 - the create minion get across
04:54 - okay bridge builder the crate minion is
04:57 - stuck Oh no you're both stuck you should
04:59 - build a bridge for the create minion to
05:00 - get to the other side so they can press
05:02 - the button to reveal a staircase to help
05:04 - you out so same functions move cursor
05:07 - and place block okay so let's see this
05:14 - first so now we can basically do that
05:17 - except we just need to place one more
05:19 - block okay so let's go to code we see
05:22 - here so we can just use repeat Loop okay
05:26 - so delete and then we're going to have
05:29 - to do it for
05:32 - times so now we can run it oh you
05:35 - remember the top so it can be in the
05:38 - [Music]
05:42 - loop okay so one two 3 4 so now it will
05:48 - go and press the uh button for us to go
05:51 - up
05:54 - oh so now we can get up here now we have
05:57 - to remove this wall okay to get into the
06:00 - next R Block Breaker you need to break
06:03 - the blocks blocking the door so you can
06:04 - get out use move cursor to position the
06:06 - cursor and break block to break the
06:08 - Block in the position you're selected so
06:10 - let's see this
06:16 - first okay so that doesn't work so
06:18 - basically we just need to break this
06:20 - block and that block so we can just go
06:22 - one hole in okay so let's go to
06:26 - code so we can just first do break block
06:29 - and then we just need to move cursor
06:31 - orange so we can um go and break that
06:35 - other
06:39 - block and then we're going to break
06:41 - block function again okay so one and
06:45 - then two and then we can go here okay so
06:49 - in the next video we'll go in but for
06:51 - now say bye to the crate minion
06:54 - bye-bye oh it face
06:58 - planted ah walk right through it that's
07:01 - crazy where a zombie it's a baby zombie
07:03 - though yeah okay well well that was fun
