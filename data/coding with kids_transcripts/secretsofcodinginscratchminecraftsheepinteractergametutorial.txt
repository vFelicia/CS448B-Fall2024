00:00 - welcome to
00:01 - coding with kids my name is andrew today
00:04 - we're
00:05 - scratching the android account
00:08 - so today i'm going to show you my
00:09 - project that i made called minecraft
00:11 - sheep interactor where on scratch you
00:13 - can interact with the sheep like you do
00:15 - in minecraft so you can dye it
00:19 - change its colors
00:20 - sheer it
00:22 - and feed it with um wheat
00:24 - so here's the code so first i got sheep
00:27 - so the costumes are all different colors
00:29 - of the sheet
00:30 - a sheer sheet and i added heart sushi so
00:34 - when you tame it
00:35 - when you feed it you it will have hearts
00:37 - so
00:38 - green fat collect it'll switch costumes
00:40 - to sheet which is why so reset and
00:42 - forever play subwoofer lullaby which is
00:44 - a minecraft song then when i receive
00:47 - hearts which is the message you get from
00:49 - the feed button when you try when you
00:52 - tame the sheet they'll switch costumes
00:54 - to hearts which is the white sheep with
00:56 - the hearts wait one second and then back
00:59 - to regular and whenever you shear
01:02 - you'll switch cosmic sheer sheep so it's
01:04 - a sheer sheet without its wall place
01:06 - down when you use a shear
01:09 - wait one second is
01:10 - um back to the regular unsheat costume
01:14 - and then when rc die it'll switch
01:16 - costume to pick random one to five so
01:18 - i'll switch to a random
01:21 - um
01:22 - costume so it'll switch to a random
01:24 - color so before the die button when the
01:26 - spray click it will broadcast the die
01:29 - but um the dye message and change wheat
01:32 - variable by one so here it's like a
01:35 - score
01:36 - so it's like you die and then the sheep
01:38 - gives you a wii yeah well it doesn't
01:41 - happen in minecraft but i just made it
01:43 - so it'll be a little more fun because
01:45 - you need a way to get beat yeah
01:48 - and then for shear when this breaks like
01:50 - a board cashier and there's a year's
01:53 - costume it's just like
01:56 - yeah so
01:58 - and then feed wheat when the spray is
02:01 - clicked if wheat is less than five and
02:04 - is more than five then it'll broadcast
02:05 - feed so you need five wheat at least
02:08 - five yeah to feed the sheep when green
02:10 - flower collected it'll set wheat
02:12 - to zero so reset the variable and for
02:15 - the wheat one green five place will hide
02:18 - and when i say feed i'll change wheat
02:20 - variable by negative five so it'll take
02:22 - five week away from because the sheep
02:24 - ate it yeah and then they'll show wait
02:26 - one second switch costs into week two so
02:29 - it'll be like
02:30 - here like like a sheep is eating it yeah
02:33 - and then broadcast hearts so the sheet
02:36 - will have hearts wait one second switch
02:38 - costs them to wheat to go back to its
02:40 - regular and then it will hide
02:42 - and then the backdrop is basically a
02:44 - minecraft backdrop out and then there
02:46 - are some colors on the top and bottom so
02:48 - they can't make it too wide stretch or
02:52 - else they look unreal yeah so you'll
02:54 - just add some
02:56 - i'll say some
02:59 - colors yeah okay so now let's play i'm
03:02 - just gonna dye it red green
03:05 - blue i realized something that
03:09 - um the white is actually smaller than
03:11 - all the other ones well it's like bad
03:14 - the other colors are like taller
03:20 - like um in the
03:22 - red over here even over here is dye
03:25 - button the other colors it isn't
03:28 - but it's like yellow too
03:30 - okay get blue
03:32 - and then i'm gonna
03:34 - feed it because i have 32 wheat wow feed
03:37 - it
03:39 - always turn back into the fat cake yeah
03:43 - sheer so now it's super skinny i love
03:45 - the sheer sound
03:50 - it's like a scissor yeah you're
03:52 - literally cutting it off and then you
03:54 - get a wool and then you're happy
03:57 - keep feeding it
03:58 - she's
04:03 - and let's do three more dice one two
04:06 - three and then last three
04:08 - three
04:10 - oh yeah it has to be more than five
04:21 - then you can do some more stuff
04:23 - like steering it again and feeding it
04:27 - again and feeding oh you can't feed it
04:29 - one more time this year she or she she
04:31 - is fancier
04:34 - [Music]
04:35 - the cutting sound is just so satisfying
04:37 - yeah i want a loop of a cutting sound
04:40 - it's just
04:44 - i guess it will get annoying and the
04:46 - sheep costume is like as suited to the
04:50 - background so it looks like it's
04:51 - actually in the background except it's
04:53 - like um
