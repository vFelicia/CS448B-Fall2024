00:06 - scratch and andrew's account star
00:08 - scratch cat so today i'm going to show
00:09 - you my project mario kart jumping game
00:12 - so it's a jumping game but more like
00:14 - different
00:15 - so first let's show you
00:18 - space space okay
00:22 - so now let's see the code so
00:25 - the obstacle and the mario sprites i
00:28 - uploaded and the mario spy
00:30 - is a gif which is a moving image and
00:33 - it's
00:34 - an image of mario running so i have a
00:37 - background and so
00:39 - this is a jumpy game so how do you jump
00:41 - so you jump by pressing the space
00:43 - key so when you press the space key or
00:46 - repeat 10 times change
00:47 - y by 20 so that will make it go up then
00:50 - it will repeat 10 times change y
00:52 - by negative 20 so it'll go down to where
00:55 - it started
00:56 - then it'll change score to one because
00:59 - you pass an obstacle yeah then when
01:02 - greenfield clicked it'll also reset the
01:05 - score
01:05 - and go to his original position also
01:09 - i'll go to nick's costume because it's
01:12 - gif
01:13 - so if you upload a gif in scratch
01:16 - it'll go into a bunch of different
01:19 - costumes so when you
01:20 - like for every next costume it will like
01:23 - it's actually doing the gif
01:25 - yeah and they'll also play a song that i
01:27 - got from youtube
01:28 - so it's a song i love that stadium
01:33 - okay next the obstacle so
01:37 - when green flag stitch wait until
01:39 - touching mario so not do
01:41 - nothing except these until touching
01:44 - mario didn't stop
01:46 - all because you lose the game then when
01:48 - green flag clicked
01:49 - forever go to x 195 and y negative 145
01:54 - which is the at the edge of the screen
01:56 - where it starts
01:57 - and then it'll glide one second to where
02:00 - mario is so
02:01 - like go for mario and then i'll switch
02:04 - causing to pick a random
02:06 - obstacle so it'll be a different
02:08 - obstacle each time that you won't
02:10 - know that's how it's different so when
02:12 - the back dropped
02:15 - i uploaded the mario and i painted it
02:18 - black
02:20 - or it would be white yeah so let's see
