12:28 - and then block stop fill fire position
12:30 - negative five so it'll do the position
12:33 - where the fire is
12:35 - and then
12:36 - it'll run the function when you type
12:38 - fire in the chat
12:40 - then on the second function it'll do
12:42 - gameplay.time
12:44 - set midnight because it's night vision
