00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew
00:04 - today we're going to teach you python so
00:07 - first we're going to make a list
00:09 - called numbers so it's just like a
00:11 - variable but there's square brackets
00:13 - which
00:13 - is the list then we have three items one
00:16 - free and five and these items
00:18 - are separated by commas so in two other
00:21 - videos we learned about lists and list
00:23 - helper functions
00:24 - next we're gonna do print five in
00:26 - numbers and print
00:28 - eight in numbers so the n will like be
00:31 - asking print a question
00:32 - here the question is is an integer five
00:35 - in numbers and is a integer eight in
00:38 - numbers
00:38 - and then print is gonna answer with true
00:41 - or
00:42 - false so integer 5 is in the list
00:44 - numbers
00:45 - so for the first one it's going to print
00:48 - true yeah
00:49 - then it's integer 8 and numbers no
00:52 - so print will answer with false next
00:55 - we're going to do
00:57 - print five not in numbers so here we
00:59 - have a not
01:00 - so not in well as print is five not in
01:03 - numbers
01:04 - well five is a number so false
01:07 - yeah is eight not in numbers it's not a
01:10 - number so print will answer with
01:12 - true yes let's say we have ctrl s go to
01:16 - terminal and
01:17 - run dot list
01:20 - so the true false false and true just as
01:23 - i
01:24 - said so it worked
01:28 - next we're gonna do cities equal chicago
01:31 - london tokyo so now we have a list
01:34 - called cities
01:35 - with all with free names of free
01:38 - random cities next we're going to do a
01:41 - for statement for city and city so city
01:44 - is a variable which is like the items so
01:48 - it's going to repeat this for loop until
01:50 - it checks every item so like
01:52 - for each item in cities i'll print the
01:54 - item so print chicago london and tokyo
01:58 - because it's a for loop and then when
01:59 - it's done with printing tokyo it'll stop
02:01 - so let's save it
02:03 - and run it so did chicago london and
02:07 - tokyo
02:08 - it worked so next i'm going to do
02:12 - numbers equals then a bunch of numbers
02:14 - 4277
02:15 - okay okay numbers. so sort is a list
02:19 - helper function
02:20 - that will sort our items in our list so
02:22 - here we have numbers so it'll sort
02:24 - from smallest to greatest so 4 8 15 16
02:28 - and so on
02:29 - next we're going to do for number and
02:31 - numbers that means for each item in the
02:33 - sorted list because we sorted the list
02:36 - then well if number is more than 42 a
02:40 - break so
02:41 - stop the for loop if the number is
02:44 - checking
02:45 - the items ticking is less than 42
02:49 - it will print the number so i expect it
02:52 - to print
02:54 - 4 8 15 16 23 and 42 and then it'll stop
02:58 - at 42.
02:59 - let's save it and see what will happen
03:02 - don't
03:04 - 15 16 23 and 42. andrew was correct
03:08 - so it stopped at 42 because the next
03:10 - item in the sorted list was 55
03:13 - so i checked the if again is 55 more
03:16 - than 42
03:17 - 55 is more than 42 so
03:20 - it went to the break that means it
03:22 - stopped
03:24 - so next we're going to do value
03:27 - equals laptop 7 phone 3 dslr and
03:31 - five so we have a list called values
03:34 - with
03:34 - items of two data types integers and
03:37 - strings
03:38 - next i'm going to do equipment equals
03:40 - two square brackets which is an
03:42 - empty list so we have two lists then for
03:45 - value and values we're checking the
03:47 - items and values
03:49 - if is instance value string equals false
03:52 - so the instance function will get the
03:56 - type of the item we're checking if a
03:58 - string but there's equals
04:00 - equals false so if the item is checking
04:03 - is not a string
04:07 - will continue which means it'll go back
04:09 - to the for loop and check the next item
04:12 - if the item is a string then equipment
04:15 - dot
04:15 - append value so append is a list helper
04:18 - function that will add
04:20 - an item to our list so here we're adding
04:23 - the item we're checking if it's a string
04:25 - now we'll add it to equipment
04:27 - so let's save it and run it
04:30 - so
04:34 - oh yeah after it checks all the items
04:37 - we're going to print
04:38 - the equipment list so save it and right
04:41 - okay so it did laptop phone and dslr so
04:44 - it checked all the items
04:45 - and it did nothing with the integers and
04:48 - the list values
04:49 - but it added the string items and values
04:53 - which are laptop phone and dslr to the
04:56 - list
04:56 - equipment and then printed equipment
04:59 - which is all the
05:00 - strings items
05:03 - so next we're going to do import random
05:06 - and
05:06 - numbers equals 2 square brackets which
05:09 - is an empty list
05:11 - so import will tell python we're using a
05:13 - module and
05:14 - random is a built-in module so in
05:17 - another video we also learned about the
05:19 - platform standard library and modules
05:21 - so we also have an empty list called
05:24 - numbers
05:24 - then while then numbers is less than
05:27 - five
05:28 - so len is a function that will tell you
05:29 - the length of something
05:31 - and the length of our list numbers is
05:33 - the number of items
05:34 - is less than five you know numbers that
05:38 - append
05:39 - random.randit100 so append
05:42 - is a list helper function that will add
05:43 - an item and we need the random module
05:46 - because we're using
05:47 - the function randit so ran it will pick
05:50 - uh
05:51 - random integer from one to a hundred and
05:54 - we need to do
05:55 - random.randit because the random
05:57 - function is inside
05:59 - the random module and the append
06:01 - function
06:02 - will add the random number into our list
06:06 - numbers until our numbers has five
06:09 - problems then for number and numbers
06:11 - that means for each item
06:13 - in the list numbers you know print that
06:16 - number
06:17 - and then if number is more or equal to
06:20 - 90
06:21 - now print that at least one number
06:23 - greater than 90 and then it'll
06:24 - break else
06:28 - it'll print no numbers greater than 90.
06:32 - so if it can't find a number equal to or
06:36 - more than 90
06:37 - it'll go past the if and goes to the
06:38 - else of the forward statement
06:41 - it will always it'll print no numbers
06:43 - greater than 90
06:45 - and then they'll always if
06:48 - even whatever it prints it'll always
06:50 - print complete at the end
06:52 - so save it and run it
06:55 - so it did 92 already that's the first
06:59 - number
07:00 - and printed number and then checked the
07:02 - if and
07:03 - 92 is more than 90 so it printed found
07:06 - at least one number greater than 90
07:08 - and then printed complete that wasn't
07:11 - the first
07:12 - twice wow let's do it again
07:15 - 94 greater than 90 again
07:19 - please please oh the last number
07:22 - the last number was
07:26 - more than 90. let's see if we can get a
07:31 - list with no numbers more than 90
07:35 - no numbers greater than 90 complete yeah
07:42 - okay mr andrew and then
07:45 - it followed andrew's command one more
07:49 - time
07:50 - no no more than nothing maybe because
07:53 - i didn't change its commands like
07:56 - computer
07:57 - okay i'll just say let's do what andrew
08:00 - said
08:01 - that was fun and that's it for today
08:04 - thank you for watching remember to smash

08:09 - bye bye
