00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - scratch and we're going to show you how
00:08 - we made a game called hang then it's
00:10 - just a classic hangman but there's only
00:12 - one word so if you don't know what
00:15 - hangman is it's where you have to guess
00:17 - a word and guess one letter at a time if
00:21 - you get a letter wrong then the hangman
00:24 - on the hanging pole so you need to try
00:26 - to save the man and guess the word
00:29 - before because his whole body should So
00:31 - like um if you guess one letter wrong
00:33 - you'll get the head and then continue
00:35 - continue if you keep on getting it wrong
00:39 - so with a happy face
00:42 - it has eyes yeah the eyes are one and in
00:46 - the mouth that's a lot of chances
00:47 - there's eight chances there's eight
00:50 - chances yeah eight chances yeah so you
00:52 - get eight chances to guess this one two
00:54 - seven letter word okay so in our hang
00:58 - band so this guy here the one who is
01:00 - about to get hanged so when it's green
01:03 - flag click it will switch to costume one
01:05 - which is like no head anything yet so
01:07 - just like a hanging hanger a hanging
01:12 - pole the set hanging which is a variable
01:14 - to one so it's like Euro to zero sorry
01:17 - so it's like um if you get one letter
01:20 - wrong it'll just go to another like add
01:23 - one to the hangman Theory then forever
01:27 - if penguin equals eight so that's how
01:29 - many chances you have then broadcast two
01:31 - and wait so it's like end game
01:34 - someone will receive what message One
01:36 - Forever create hanging by one next cause
01:39 - and weight 1.5 seconds then stop the
01:42 - script so it's like when I read when I
01:44 - received the message one it will like
01:46 - get another like a body on so like the
01:49 - next one off so head body hands on well
01:54 - arms and then
01:56 - um for word one well letter one it will
02:00 - switch costume to a costume one so like
02:01 - First costume is just like a letter yeah
02:05 - whatever if answer equals s so this um
02:08 - this word letter one is
02:13 - just this one and then wait one second
02:15 - and then switch costume hosting two
02:17 - which is the letter then process done
02:20 - change answer by one so it's like
02:22 - counting how many letters you have
02:23 - correct and stop the scripts yeah
02:26 - so like onward tube one for you were
02:29 - four were five we're six and that were
02:31 - seven is the same yeah they're all
02:34 - letters so it's the same as this code
02:37 - except just different answer like answer
02:39 - equals
02:41 - um it's not this but Z then it's like
02:43 - gonna run this script
02:46 - so then this this the person it'll just
02:49 - add it's a instruction The Hanger
02:52 - yeah it's so mean
02:55 - so he's got the hanger why would he give
02:58 - you a chance to guess a word and save
03:00 - the man from being hanged because it's
03:03 - just a game
03:04 - just a game so he'll ask you like what
03:07 - letter you want and if it it keeps on
03:10 - just when I receive these just keep on
03:13 - asking the questions
03:15 - so these are the
03:17 - um letters that are not in the words so
03:22 - like Z that's the answer
03:25 - so Z so is well green fact clicked High
03:28 - because you didn't guess anything yet if
03:30 - answer equals z then it will show and
03:32 - wait one second switch costume costume
03:34 - one so the area and the blue which is
03:37 - like a sky where there are all the
03:39 - letters yeah so there's all the wrong
03:41 - letters yeah then you see the costume
03:44 - one is like X out because it's not here
03:47 - so you have to remember which letter you
03:50 - did so here's my comment I don't think
03:52 - you should do an X because you kind of
03:55 - will
03:56 - you can still see
03:59 - so like it exit out and then for this
04:04 - one is like
04:05 - it's custom one so it's U1 that means it
04:09 - gets guess the word and then custom two
04:12 - you lost try again and this guy just
04:16 - disappears bye-bye like that so it's
04:19 - like if green fat clicked hi go to front
04:22 - layer so it's here then if answer equals
04:25 - seven then show which cartoon to costume
04:28 - one so if you get this word correct then
04:31 - it's going to do you wet and then when I
04:34 - receive two which is when you lost you
04:37 - switch your costume too you lost try
04:40 - again so we need to go to front layer
04:42 - because you don't want it to be hiding
04:44 - or getting uh some parts of it getting
04:46 - covered by other Sprites yeah so these
04:49 - are just the backdrops so like when you
04:51 - win you get this backdrop and when you
04:53 - lose you get this backdrop it's red the
04:55 - sky turned red
04:58 - so it's like when greenpark like
05:00 - switched backdrop to backdrop one which
05:02 - is like this just this usable Blue Sky
05:05 - just a usable day forever if answer
05:08 - equals seven so if you get the word
05:10 - correct switch back to backdrop free
05:12 - which is this
05:14 - you win background which is the green
05:16 - background and then when I receive two
05:18 - switch background to backdrop two the
05:20 - blood
05:21 - stop and then stop off yeah
05:25 - okay okay what letter do you guess I'm
05:27 - gonna guess I'm gonna go okay because I
05:30 - write another word
05:32 - okay
05:33 - sorry yes okay so I saw it as I'm also

07:39 - the platform we're using yeah so you can
07:43 - like make your own words by just
07:45 - switching the letters so
07:48 - um just do this code but add all the
07:50 - alphabet letters over here I don't have
07:53 - like you know I don't have a because
07:55 - there's a a here but if you want to make
07:57 - a different word you can add like switch
07:59 - these letters and add all the other
08:02 - letters that aren't in this alphabet to
08:05 - make your own word so that was fun and
08:09 - that's it for today thank you for
