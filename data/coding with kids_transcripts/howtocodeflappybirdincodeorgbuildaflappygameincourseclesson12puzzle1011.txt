00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is and my name is andrew today
00:05 - we're in code.org
00:07 - and we're score c lesson 12
00:10 - build a flappy king so we're on number
00:13 - 10.
00:14 - so
00:24 - so we have the thing called when hit an
00:27 - obstacle and then you can put code below
00:30 - when hit an obstacle
00:31 - to program what what will happen
00:34 - when flappy bird hits an obstacle like a
00:37 - pipe
00:38 - so right now the instructions are want
00:41 - us to
00:42 - set the score to zero and hit an
00:43 - obstacle not end
00:45 - the game we're gonna play yes i am
00:49 - let's choose crash crash
00:53 - crashes craig
01:01 - so when we hit an obstacle um
01:04 - it will play a crash sound and then
01:07 - it'll settle
01:10 - you hit the ground so you game over okay
01:12 - my turn
01:15 - let's make a big o that's the maximum
01:18 - let's see if i can get one point
01:21 - oh no one let's get a
01:26 - i got zero points now because when you
01:28 - touch a pipe which is the obstacle
01:31 - your score becomes zero and it'll play a
01:33 - sound so even if you got one point
01:36 - your minus at whatever amount of points
01:38 - you got
01:40 - 100 yeah okay let's go to puzzle 10 now
01:45 - press continue oh yeah puzzle 11.
01:49 - now the instruction says create your own
01:51 - flappy game
01:52 - you can change the visuals and remove
01:54 - even the gravity
01:56 - when you're done click finish to share
01:57 - with friends on their phones
02:00 - so i'm gonna make a opposite
02:03 - flappy game so i'm just
02:07 - the jack very large
02:10 - and then one past obstacle
02:13 - you need an end game because it's the
02:15 - opposite
02:17 - then that's really easy because the
02:20 - pipes are always
02:21 - bigger but they're still the
02:24 - pipes are always bigger than the gaps
02:29 - we play smash
02:33 - that sounds like
02:48 - um
02:53 - [Music]
02:59 - oh that would be cool and then
03:12 - you can just keep going to the top
03:14 - forever and out of the screen and then
03:16 - you always
03:31 - yeah well the ground is mars now we're
03:35 - in a dark hallway now we're back on mars
03:38 - warning
03:39 - somewhere now some normal ground
03:46 - [Music]
03:49 - okay one more time your turn yeah
03:55 - i'm superman i'm mars there's also
03:58 - batman
04:03 - drawing mars again that meant
04:07 - this
04:10 - that was margaret we're on the roost of
04:13 - christmas oh
04:14 - lava lava
04:18 - nine points it's more easy
04:50 - this is
05:09 - point so we can see what happened
05:13 - it played the sound laser and then it
05:16 - ended the game
05:19 - so when it hit the ground you also and
05:22 - hit the ground you end the game
05:25 - so when when you set all those things
05:30 - normal and very large yeah
05:34 - and thanks for watching remember to
