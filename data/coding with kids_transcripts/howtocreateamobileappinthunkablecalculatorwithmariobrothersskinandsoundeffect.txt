01:26 - plus and equals yesterday function now
01:30 - there is wait what are the numbers are
01:32 - they buttons
01:33 - yes there's buttons right here
01:37 - so when you um look here you already
01:39 - have the buttons
01:41 - then there's the invisible it's the coin
01:44 - sound so it's the sound yeah which is
01:48 - where this is mario and this is the
01:50 - chord
01:52 - and plays the sound so you can upload an
01:55 - mp3 file
01:56 - yeah or type in a link yeah
01:59 - and then you can also change the volume
02:02 - yeah so the
02:02 - volumes are now five yeah so now
02:06 - you search sound yeah okay let's go back
02:09 - here
02:10 - s oh see there's
02:14 - sound right here
02:17 - next now let's go to the blocks okay so
02:20 - first there are four app variables the
02:23 - first variable is display text
02:26 - so it displays the operators which are
02:28 - plus minus
02:29 - and equal then the second variable is
02:33 - last number so it will remember your
02:36 - last number
02:38 - and then the current number is the
02:40 - number you're typing
02:42 - then the last variable is operation
02:45 - so it checks your operation like plus or
02:48 - minus
02:49 - so our first so when button one clicked
02:53 - set input to one and then it used the
02:56 - function
02:56 - append number and there's three
02:59 - functions
03:00 - yeah so let's go to a pen number so
03:03 - it saves the curtain number
03:07 - because it joins accurate number with
03:09 - input so the input is the number so it
03:12 - goes to the app current number
03:14 - that means the number you are currently
03:16 - typing so
03:17 - the code for number two and number three
03:19 - is just the same
03:21 - for number y yeah and then
03:24 - append to text the function it will
03:28 - print the operation that means the plus
03:30 - or minus
03:32 - and join the numbers and switch the
03:35 - numbers
03:36 - placement then it will play
03:39 - the sound that is the point set yeah and
03:41 - then
03:42 - when plus clicked it will set the
03:44 - operation to plus
03:46 - so now it knows that you are
03:49 - adding something then set up
03:52 - operation to input and this plus and
03:55 - then append text
03:56 - which will print plus and then calculate
03:59 - calculate is the third function yeah so
04:02 - let's see
04:02 - calculate so it checks your operation
04:05 - and then
04:06 - it calculates using that operation the
04:09 - math last
04:10 - number and the current number add them
04:13 - together
04:14 - yeah so if we had like minus or
04:18 - or divide functioning then there would
04:21 - be
04:21 - else and other conditions then it will
04:24 - set
04:24 - out number two blank because you're
04:28 - going to type another
04:29 - number you didn't press equal yet yeah
04:32 - and then when equal click then we'll use
04:35 - the function calculate
04:36 - and then from display set text to app
04:39 - last number
04:40 - so in calculate it sets the last number
04:44 - to
04:44 - blank so the sum is in the at
04:47 - last number so it will print the app
04:51 - last number and then it will play the
04:52 - coin
04:53 - sound and then sip at last number to
04:55 - zero and set app display to
04:58 - blank because you are restarting
05:01 - okay let's preview preview
05:06 - okay so we're gonna try on this preview
05:10 - okay so let's do one plus two
05:14 - so it's playing the coin sounds when we
05:15 - click a button yeah
05:17 - then let's press equal okay
05:21 - three because one plus two yeah let's do
05:25 - 111 plus
