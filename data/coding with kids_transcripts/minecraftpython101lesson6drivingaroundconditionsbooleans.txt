00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're
00:04 - back with education 101 lesson six
00:08 - so first we're going to talk to the ceo
00:11 - so the ceo
00:12 - says we are trying to further develop
00:14 - the capabilities of the agent by making
00:16 - a language triangle
00:17 - for now we are still in the testing
00:19 - phase with simulated environments
00:21 - however as soon as the code is finished
00:23 - the agent can be deployed
00:28 - to the developer so the developer says
00:33 - i need to write some code that will make
00:34 - the agent stop start
00:36 - wait for two seconds depending on the
00:38 - track can you write some code to make
00:40 - the agent wear the lights
00:42 - [Music]
00:56 - try to help the agent follow track
01:00 - so first here we do it
01:17 - [Music]
01:28 - so the agent will try to detect
01:29 - something agent
01:32 - detection dot block
01:37 - so try to protect the block so which
01:40 - direction
01:41 - so let's left so
01:44 - the agent will try to detect block to
01:47 - its left
01:48 - then if it detects the block to its left
01:56 - [Music]
02:03 - now we are
02:08 - okay so there are blocks to its left so
02:12 - go forward so go forward until the gold
02:14 - block
02:15 - so now we're in part two the red light
02:19 - okay so now
02:24 - here if not we're gonna add
02:28 - enough so if not so if the agent does
02:32 - not
02:32 - detect the block to its left it
02:36 - [Music]
02:44 - okay so it doesn't detect the block so
02:47 - move forward
02:48 - and you'll move then it detects this red
02:51 - block so it'll stop at
02:52 - this gold block okay finally we're at
02:54 - part three
02:56 - so now we have the yellow light
02:59 - okay so then
03:02 - do another f here
03:06 - so i'm going to do if
03:09 - asian oops
03:12 - if agent dot detect
03:19 - a gent detect
03:24 - detection dot block
03:31 - to its left still left
03:35 - then we're gonna
03:44 - loop
03:47 - 2 000 so here it will pause for
03:51 - 2 000 milliseconds so that means two
03:54 - seconds
03:54 - yeah then finally after it pauses
03:58 - because it's the yellow light
04:01 - dot move
04:05 - forward one time
04:09 - okay so now
04:15 - okay so first it pauses
04:20 - and then after pauses it goes to
04:24 - this now we're going to activity 2
04:28 - i'm going to talk to the programmer so
04:31 - the programmer says i need to write some
04:33 - code that will give the agent the
04:35 - ability
04:36 - to navigate street corners by looking at
04:38 - the signs
04:39 - however it never turns in the correct
04:41 - direction can you write some code to
04:43 - make the agent aware of the signs
04:45 - okay so let's go for a station here and
04:48 - there's a sign here and then
04:51 - let me stop the old block okay
04:56 - so now we're going to try to help the
04:59 - agent
05:00 - to follow signs
05:04 - okay so first we have two variables
05:08 - that they give us so there's a variable
05:10 - called left
05:12 - it was blue glazed terracotta
05:15 - and right is pink glazed terracotta
05:18 - okay so first um
05:22 - for index and range and
05:25 - it has to be we repeat it nine times
05:29 - okay so for index and range nine times
05:33 - we are going to do if h is
05:36 - agent dot detect inspect
05:40 - inspect inspect
05:47 - so there's another function so the agent
05:48 - will try to inspect something
05:50 - it just don't inspect agent
05:55 - is fiction spectrum
06:07 - [Music]
06:13 - so here we do two equal signs
06:16 - so we're gonna see if the block is
06:20 - the left variable which is blue glazed
06:23 - terracotta
06:24 - okay then
06:27 - we're gonna do
06:32 - agent dot turn
06:36 - left turn left
06:40 - underscore return so the agent will turn
06:44 - left and follow the sign okay now let's
06:47 - run
06:47 - okay so there's a sign right there
06:55 - so here also
07:14 - else
07:28 - [Music]
07:42 - this one
07:45 - [Music]
08:06 - inspect asian
08:09 - inspection dot block forward
08:14 - equals equals
08:17 - right so now i'm going to check the
08:19 - right if it doesn't see the
08:21 - if it doesn't see since if it doesn't
08:24 - inspect the blue
08:25 - glazed terracotta it'll go to the lf
08:28 - which it'll inspect right which is pink
08:31 - glazed terracotta and if it does
08:36 - it'll do
08:43 - [Music]
08:52 - okay so now let's run
08:56 - [Music]
08:59 - so it turns turns again
09:02 - and does its final turn okay
09:07 - so now we're gonna go to 2d3
09:12 - and we'll talk to the ai developer
09:16 - so the ai developer says i'm trying to
09:19 - make the engine navigate
09:20 - through these obstacles the eyes get
09:22 - stuck in the corner to the right and
09:24 - can't get up
09:25 - can you write some code that will get
09:26 - the agent from this randomly generated
09:28 - course
09:29 - so here is the force and the agent needs
09:32 - to try
09:33 - to not crash into anything and go to
09:36 - this block
09:38 - okay so now we're gonna help
09:42 - the agent to avoid avoid
09:45 - obstacles okay so we're gonna write some
09:48 - code to make the agent detect and import
09:50 - randomly placed blocks
09:52 - as it moves through the course to do
09:54 - this
09:55 - and if else conditional with an
09:58 - lf conditional imagery for the if
10:01 - condition use two agent detect command
10:03 - swift pan
10:04 - and not an operator in retrieve for the
10:07 - lf condition
10:08 - use two asian detect commands with an
10:11 - antenna
10:11 - operator in retrieve example two
10:14 - conditions
10:15 - with an and not operator agent dot
10:17 - detect vision detection
10:19 - the block direction and not agent dot
10:22 - detect
10:22 - agent detection that block direction
10:25 - okay
10:25 - so first we have 18 that moves left
10:28 - one right
10:55 - [Music]
11:26 - detect
11:28 - [Music]
11:30 - that detect agent dot detection dot
11:33 - block
11:36 - left so we're gonna change it forward to
11:40 - left
11:46 - agent dot
11:49 - move left
11:54 - one time so which is this one
11:57 - i'm just going to read that then here
12:00 - we're going to do lf
12:04 - agent dot detection
12:08 - no detect dot agent okay
12:11 - this one and
12:15 - agent dot detect
12:21 - so
12:26 - detect agent detection block
12:30 - left
12:31 - [Music]
12:35 - okay then
12:39 - [Music]
12:50 - um
12:52 - [Music]
13:04 - let's go agent
13:07 - [Music]
13:19 - yeah okay so is there are rockets
13:22 - so we can also do a little bit there are
13:25 - two steams
13:27 - cool they have that detection thingy too
13:30 - okay so now finally we're going
13:33 - [Music]
13:36 - okay so now we're back at the beginning
13:38 - well that was
13:39 - fun and that's it for today thank you
13:42 - for watching
13:43 - remember to smash the like button and
13:46 - subscribe
13:47 - bye bye
