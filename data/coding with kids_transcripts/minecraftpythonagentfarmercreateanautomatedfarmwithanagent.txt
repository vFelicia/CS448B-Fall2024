00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:05 - education edition so today we're going
00:07 - to go on python and here there are a
00:10 - bunch of tutorials using
00:13 - python so today we're going to do agent
00:15 - farmer so here we're going to make an
00:17 - agent make the agent make a farm
00:20 - and plant wheat so let's create an
00:22 - automated farm using agent
00:24 - so first before you plant anything your
00:27 - agent will need weed seeds to plant you
00:29 - can use the agent.give command to give
00:31 - your agent items it works like so agent
00:33 - that give item quantity and then slot so
00:36 - here's an example agent.givestone
00:39 - 10 stone blocks
00:41 - and slot 3. so first we're going to do
00:44 - asian.give wheat seeds
00:46 - the 64 receipt
00:48 - at slot 1. so now we're going to run it
00:51 - okay so now you can
00:54 - let uh right click and then here there
00:57 - will be seeds
00:58 - so the agent gave itself seeds okay
01:01 - so
01:02 - next
01:04 - we're going to do
01:05 - now that not that the farming agent have
01:07 - been set up you need to tell the soil to
01:09 - do this you need agent.tail function
01:11 - here's how it works it's in that tail
01:13 - direction
01:14 - so your agent is currently above the
01:16 - dirt so you tilt down
01:19 - okay
01:20 - then and a lot at the line of code to
01:22 - tell the dirt down below your agent so
01:26 - here
01:27 - i'm gonna do you just stop
01:30 - until
01:33 - now do
01:35 - down
01:37 - so
01:38 - now okay
01:43 - okay look so i set up the farm okay so
01:46 - this is on a hill so just leak out
01:48 - so now i tilled the bottom the block
01:51 - below the agent this isn't really good
01:53 - because if you know the water is leaking
01:56 - out because it's like uneven terrain
01:58 - when the agent spawned the fire okay so
02:00 - the picture is in like a just like a
02:03 - black land yeah but we're not
02:05 - we're not in a flatland so the law just
02:08 - needs that but the ages successfully
02:10 - tilled the block below okay
02:12 - so next here
02:14 - time to start planting seeds you're
02:16 - going to check of the area above the
02:18 - below the agent is air if air is below
02:21 - the agent then you want to place a c if
02:23 - you do this in place when you will use
02:24 - an if statement which can be used to run
02:26 - specific chunks of code if a condition
02:29 - is true so here if a equals equals b so
02:32 - here
02:34 - we can use if statements similar to the
02:36 - example below if air equals air say true
02:39 - so of course that's true because air and
02:40 - air are the same and if one minus two
02:43 - equals one six
02:45 - true one one minus two
02:48 - is not one so it won't say true
02:51 - okay
02:52 - so
02:53 - here if text equals text i'm gonna say
02:56 - true so i'm gonna test that so i said
02:58 - true because true because text is text
03:02 - okay next we're going to check what
03:05 - blocks are around the agent you can use
03:07 - the agent.inspect function when you're
03:10 - running you if your agent checks what
03:12 - block is in the direction you say and
03:14 - the agent won't return the block this
03:16 - name cannot then be used in your code
03:18 - for example derpy this is how it works
03:21 - the agent that inspect direction
03:23 - and you can use agent.spec in an if
03:25 - statement to
03:26 - to only run code if your agent finds a
03:29 - certain block
03:30 - okay fix the code below to have your
03:32 - agent inspected down is equal to
03:34 - okay so agent inspect
03:38 - so here inspect
03:41 - down so the block below the agent
03:58 - so i said true found air because the
04:00 - block below is air
04:02 - so every time you run it we make a new
04:04 - farm because you see
04:07 - we always run through functions yes
04:11 - okay
04:12 - so just keep moving this way okay
04:15 - so next we're going to do now you need
04:18 - the code
04:19 - the agent to place down we see to place
04:21 - the c you can use agent.place here's how
04:24 - to use it agent.placeslot direction but
04:27 - can you add code to have the agent place
04:28 - a c down from slot one
04:31 - so here after
04:32 - say found air i'm gonna do agent dot
04:36 - place
04:37 - can you have can you add code to the
04:39 - agent please c down okay so i'm gonna do
04:43 - first slot one
04:45 - down because in slot one we have wheat c
04:48 - sixty four of them so now we're gonna
04:50 - run
04:52 - until four right here okay so now this
04:55 - is a better farm yeah because now it's
04:58 - even terrain so now the plant did the
05:01 - recede in the first till block so it
05:04 - worked okay
05:06 - so next
05:07 - after your agent has planted a seed you
05:09 - will need to get it to move to next
05:11 - block of dirt to do this you need
05:13 - you use agent.moves this is how it works
05:16 - you shouldn't move direction so add the
05:18 - code to move your agent forward after
05:20 - you place the seat
05:22 - so after here we're going to do agent
05:24 - move
05:26 - and do
05:29 - forward
05:31 - okay
05:32 - now
05:33 - um
05:34 - okay
05:40 - moved forward to the next block
05:42 - so work okay
05:45 - so stepping you have coded your agent to
05:47 - till the ground plan c to move to next
05:49 - block but you want this code to run over
05:52 - and over again to tell all the blocks
05:54 - here
05:55 - hi cal
05:56 - okay
05:57 - so
05:58 - then
06:00 - loop lets you run sections of code over
06:02 - and over again for a set of times here's
06:05 - how you can make a loop for count and
06:07 - range for p4 blah blah blah okay
06:09 - the code only repeats two times make it
06:12 - repeat six times instead okay so here
06:14 - this is the number of times that will
06:16 - run so we're gonna turn the two to six
06:18 - so we can
06:21 - get the cows lacking
06:23 - so we can tell all the blocks
06:26 - okay
06:27 - now
06:29 - make a new five over eight okay sound
06:32 - that's still
06:34 - so now all of these we seeds are planted
06:38 - so that row is done yeah okay so now
06:42 - first i want bone medium
06:45 - to make it um grow faster yeah okay so
06:49 - we're going to use it
06:52 - okay so now they're all wheat
06:55 - it will be broken yeah so now we can
06:57 - break them and we'll get but we're
07:00 - creative okay
07:01 - so
07:02 - next i want to
07:04 - change
07:05 - instead of wheat seeds
07:07 - let's do this
07:09 - seed
07:10 - there's thing called
07:12 - let me search it
07:16 - wait this is cocoa beans
07:19 - uh
07:21 - seed
07:22 - there's beet root melon
07:25 - so let's but the melon pumpkin is
07:28 - actually after you do the bone meal you
07:30 - still have to wait yeah okay so we're
07:32 - going to do b
07:33 - b root c okay
07:36 - so change the wheat c's here
07:39 - to
07:40 - eat
07:41 - fruit
07:42 - okay
07:45 - one right there
07:49 - oh there you sleep because there'll be
07:51 - receive
07:53 - you forgot the underscore i think
08:08 - let's
08:11 - again
08:13 - let's try to tame one animal with wheat
08:16 - so here we oh i just got these
08:20 - yeah because i stomped on it
08:22 - okay so now we're gonna try to tame one
08:25 - cow
08:26 - [Music]
08:28 - it was like facing the other way
08:30 - now it has hearts yay there's another
08:33 - one yeah because they
08:35 - oh yeah they're gonna mate
08:41 - okay let's see another one
08:45 - they're gonna follow you
08:48 - well
08:49 - they don't need to but
08:51 - how about
08:52 - sheep sheep i'm trying to
08:56 - assume are a little far away
08:58 - so i'm going to try to
09:00 - i should come come come come
09:03 - follow me
09:04 - okay
09:18 - because we have seed
09:20 - uh
09:22 - okay i'm just gonna spawn them because i
09:23 - don't see any chickens here you just see
09:26 - your cow
09:27 - okay chicken
09:29 - your spawn chicken uh let's turn back
09:33 - no
09:34 - there's
09:39 - [Music]
09:48 - okay now they're making
09:51 - chicken babies
