00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:06 - pipelines today we're going to learn
00:07 - about dictionaries in python so first we
00:09 - have
00:10 - mob equals and curly bracket so mob is
00:13 - the dictionary's name
00:15 - then we have the key then the value so
00:18 - we have
00:19 - three keys and three values name so the
00:22 - name
00:23 - is wither then hearts 500 and enemies
00:26 - and there's a list with players sand and
00:29 - mobs so this is a dictionary
00:32 - so dictionaries values can have integers
00:35 - strings and
00:36 - lists now we're going to print them all
00:38 - to see how
00:39 - a dictionary looks when we print it
00:43 - so now i did name whether hearts 500
00:46 - enemies then the list
00:48 - player sand and mobs so printed the key
00:50 - then the value
00:51 - okay next one we do print mob name so
00:55 - name is a key
00:56 - so when we do this we get the name key
00:59 - and it will print the value which is
01:01 - weather it's now a printed weather
01:05 - next we're doing print mob docket color
01:08 - so we're gonna see what happens if we
01:10 - try to get
01:11 - a key that does not exist
01:14 - so it did none because there is no color
01:17 - key in the mob dictionary
01:19 - next we're going to do print mob docket
01:21 - color then the default value is not
01:23 - found so we're going to save it and
01:27 - do this so it did not found because we
01:30 - did the default value
01:32 - then we're going to do mob name equals
01:34 - ender dragon then we're going to print
01:36 - mob
01:36 - get name so here we're changing the
01:39 - value
01:40 - of the name key so before it was
01:43 - withered now we're changing it to ender
01:45 - dragon
01:46 - so now let's see if we worked
01:48 - successfully so
01:49 - we use the key again and it did ender
01:52 - dragon which means we change the name
01:53 - value
01:54 - successfully make sure we do mob color
01:57 - equals blacks then we'll print mob dot
02:00 - get color
02:01 - so mod color equals black is how we add
02:04 - a new
02:05 - key in value
02:09 - did black because we successfully added
02:13 - the key in that
02:14 - next we're going to do print mob
02:20 - sprints
02:22 - save it
02:26 - so it did this so it up
02:29 - it added the color black and
02:32 - it's like the name value is still under
02:35 - drag
02:36 - next we're going to do mod.update so
02:38 - with this we can update
02:40 - the key and values so here we change the
02:43 - heart's value to 700
02:45 - instead of 500. now i'm going to print
02:47 - them all
02:49 - so now it's hard to change from 500 from
02:52 - the last time we run it now to
02:53 - 700. if we're going to do dell
02:57 - mob and then we're going to print them
02:58 - up so dell is basically delete
03:00 - so here we're deleting the value
03:17 - print ma so pop is basically delete
03:20 - but it'll also return the values now
03:22 - save it
03:24 - so the name equals underdragging and
03:26 - color black so now there's no hearts
03:30 - print hearts then did 700 so
03:34 - the pop returned the value so delete is
03:37 - different from
03:38 - top yeah so now we're going to print the
03:39 - lens mop so the link function
03:41 - here when we use it on the dictionary
03:43 - it'll show us the number of pairs
03:46 - of keys and values so i did two because
03:50 - now there are only two more pairs of
03:53 - keys and
03:54 - values so next we're going to print mob
03:56 - dot key so the keys function will show
03:58 - us the keys
03:59 - that are in the mob dictionary
04:05 - so now there are dick keys which are
04:07 - dictionary keys
04:08 - name and color so there are only two
04:10 - keys left
04:11 - then we're going to print mod values
04:13 - this is just like the keys function
04:15 - except it will show us the values inside
04:17 - the dictionary
04:20 - so now i dedicate values under dragon
04:23 - and blacks there
04:24 - are still two we're going values print
04:27 - mob the items
04:29 - the mobs the items the items function
04:31 - will show us
04:32 - the remaining pairs of values and keys
04:37 - so detect items name enter dragon and
04:40 - then color and black so it's the keys
04:42 - and values
04:44 - next we're going to do before statement
04:46 - so for each
04:47 - key in the mob dictionary we're going to
04:49 - print the key
04:52 - now i did name and color because those
04:54 - are the remaining keys
04:56 - and we're going to do that same except
04:58 - we're going to print the keys and that
05:00 - at least in the mall of the icons
05:04 - so now it did name enter dragon and then
05:07 - color
05:07 - black well that was fun and that's it
05:10 - for today
