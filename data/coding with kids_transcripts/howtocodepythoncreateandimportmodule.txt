00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're going to
00:06 - teach you python
00:07 - today we're going to learn about python
00:09 - modules so models use
00:10 - import to reuse functions across
00:14 - different files
00:15 - so first we have a file called deck.py
00:18 - so first we do def create deck so we
00:21 - defining a function called create
00:23 - so we're free lists suits equals heart
00:26 - spades clubs and diamonds
00:28 - and then ranks equals two three four
00:30 - five six seven eight nine ten
00:32 - jack queen can ace so if two four
00:35 - statements
00:36 - and the suits and ranks list we're gonna
00:38 - make a deck of cards
00:40 - and we're gonna use the deck list to
00:43 - put all of the cars in the list so then
00:46 - we're gonna make the deck
00:49 - so four suit and suits so it's gonna
00:51 - check the items
00:53 - first suits and then we're gonna put a
00:55 - four statement inside of four stick
00:57 - so for rankin ranks now deck.append so a
01:00 - pen is a list helper function
01:02 - that will add the item and we're going
01:04 - to do f string rank of suit
01:06 - the first time it runs these four
01:08 - statements in the suit
01:11 - suits list it will be checking hearts
01:13 - and ranks list it will be checking too
01:16 - so add the card two of hearts
01:20 - now keep repeating that until
01:23 - ace of diamonds and then we're gonna
01:26 - return
01:27 - deck so save it and then go to module.py
01:30 - so we're going to import the file deck
01:33 - so we can use the functions in the
01:35 - deck.py
01:37 - and then we're going to do cars which is
01:39 - a variable equals
01:40 - deck dot create deck so we can use
01:44 - the create deck function inside the deck
01:47 - file
01:47 - then it's gonna force card and cards
01:51 - print cards so it'll print every card in
01:53 - the create deck
01:55 - so save it and run so
01:58 - it did all of these cards there's a lot
02:02 - of cards
02:02 - so started with two of hearts and then
02:05 - ended with ace of diamonds so i
02:07 - printed all 52 cars just as we
02:11 - fought and it worked well that was fun
02:15 - and that's it for today thank you for
