00:10 - fish time
00:11 - let's see what it does
00:21 - let's turn it back but how does it do
00:25 - that let's see in the code
00:30 - when green flap click forever place an

00:35 - because you're underwater and there's
00:37 - fish then
00:38 - when green falls click forever next

00:43 - so there's a lot of different kind of
00:44 - fish costumes there's
00:46 - four the first one is a clown fish
00:49 - just like nemo so when green file click
00:53 - erase off forever so you added the pen
00:57 - extension yeah erase all so you will see
01:01 - just the background and a fish
01:03 - it will follow your mouse pointer change
01:05 - color effect by one
01:07 - and stamp so like when you stamp it it
01:10 - will go everywhere
01:12 - just like that and also keep changing
01:14 - color because you changed color effect
01:16 - by
