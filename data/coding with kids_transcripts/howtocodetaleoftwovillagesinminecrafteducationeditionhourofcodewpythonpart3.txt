00:00 - welcome to curtin with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're a minecraft education
00:07 - so today we are at the villager and
00:09 - villager
00:10 - our country yeah so the simple story is
00:13 - there are once two villages the village
00:15 - villager
00:16 - villages and the pillager village
00:19 - village
00:20 - so they they both both villagers knew
00:24 - how to live in their own way and they
00:25 - never asked their neighbor for help
00:27 - so now they've grown apart and forgot
00:30 - each other
00:31 - so now we're doing six tasks to bring
00:34 - them together yeah so today we're gonna
00:36 - go to the older town
00:39 - and help the kids get their ball from
00:42 - the witch okay
00:43 - witches are actually village
00:47 - so let me zap them so we're gonna talk
00:50 - to this kid
00:52 - so it's called chat so the child says
00:54 - hey can you help us
00:55 - our ball full flew ups that's changed
00:58 - with drew's house and now it's mystic
01:00 - we don't know how we don't know much
01:02 - about that villager but we think it
01:03 - might be a witch
01:04 - next we tried the elevator but it
01:06 - doesn't seem to work besides we're too
01:08 - scared to go up there
01:10 - could you use your agent to help us get
01:11 - our boss or start activity
01:14 - so you can see that a witch
01:17 - is there holding the ball so now we have
01:20 - levers so our agent needs to flip the
01:23 - levers
01:23 - to get the elevator up and get the ball
01:26 - which is
01:27 - get the ball from the witch so we can
01:31 - do a get that interact forward so it'll
01:34 - like
01:35 - use whatever is in front of it so we
01:38 - move the agent to the all the levers and
01:41 - then
01:42 - do the agent to interact with it so the
01:44 - agent will flip the levers
01:46 - and once the agent has flipped all of
01:48 - the levers there will be an
01:50 - elevator and we can get back the so ball
01:53 - going to code here so now i'm going to
01:56 - go
01:58 - when you first go up and then interrupt
02:01 - so go up oops
02:04 - agent dot move
02:23 - so flip the lever and the lamp went on
02:26 - which means the
02:27 - agent has flipped the lever so now when
02:29 - you go to
02:30 - this lever up
02:34 - two times and go right two times and
02:38 - then interrupt
02:39 - so we're gonna go move up
02:42 - two times a
02:46 - check dot move up then
02:50 - check and move right two times then
02:54 - interact
02:55 - yes here
02:59 - asian dot moon
03:16 - so we're gonna so it won't repeat the
03:20 - code
03:20 - yeah so now we have the second lever
03:24 - clipped so now we need to go left two
03:27 - times
03:29 - so i'm gonna change the left right to
03:32 - the left
03:34 - left left and do one here
03:39 - agent dot move left
03:42 - and then the
03:46 - [Music]
04:07 - so now we have three of the four levers
04:10 - clipped so now when you go up two times
04:13 - and move
04:14 - three times right
04:17 - okay serve you isn't that move up
04:22 - then again
04:26 - up
04:33 - and range how many times free

04:47 - so now the elevator is going up
04:51 - now the witch is coming down with the
04:52 - red ball
04:58 - so now they're playing the caretakers
05:01 - say sometimes the unknown can be scary
05:03 - the illegal children had never met the
05:05 - villager but they had heard stories this
05:07 - year
05:08 - after adrian fixed the elevator the
05:10 - villager was able to come down and meet
05:11 - the children
05:13 - then the caretaker says the children
05:15 - learned that the villager was very kind
05:17 - and not the scary wish they had assumed
05:18 - it to be
05:19 - don't forget to go check on the street
