00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name
00:03 - is claudia and this video is going to be
00:06 - about
00:06 - how a project works so here
00:10 - we will have some projects i'm going to
00:13 - choose
00:14 - artists you can choose other things
00:19 - okay okay there is action
00:23 - but you will move the
00:26 - drawer brushes
00:30 - you will set the color or set color to
00:32 - random
00:34 - um you can set pattern draw stickers
00:37 - then draw sticker with size of
00:41 - um the pick pixels what pixels you want
00:46 - then this is loops from i
00:50 - for i from question mark
00:53 - to question mark count by question mark
00:56 - repeat question mark times
00:58 - over here has math so zero for the
01:02 - question marks it can be for the
01:04 - question marks or you can just type it
01:06 - like
01:07 - this you can just type it 24
01:14 - 56 just doing random numbers
01:17 - eight oops not e 34
01:23 - some random numbers right now i'll just
01:26 - try one
01:27 - something
01:30 - two
01:35 - it just moves too forwards so
01:38 - that's just nothing so math
01:42 - is random random logic
01:46 - if equals
01:50 - then there's functions you can create a
01:54 - functions or
01:55 - you can edit functions variables
01:59 - such slaves that are to do
02:02 - comments comments is just like this you
02:05 - just put
02:05 - and then type random things like this
02:10 - is
02:13 - is that is
02:20 - code.org
02:22 - but comments don't really do anything
02:25 - see
02:26 - it just like it just
02:30 - stays there okay
02:33 - now first we have to do let's just get
02:36 - this
02:37 - comment away move forward by
02:41 - 100 pixels let's say and
02:45 - brushes to random color
02:49 - over here see
02:52 - it move forward 100 pixels
02:56 - but if we keep repeat
03:00 - it let's see
03:03 - 30 times let's say 30 times and it will
03:06 - give you
03:06 - 300 pixels i think so
03:12 - you can't see it anymore because 300
03:15 - pixels are too long
03:18 - okay let's try 10 that would be 100
03:21 - pixels
03:22 - still you can't see it how about two
03:27 - now it's through there right now i'm
03:30 - trying to build
03:32 - a square let's say now we have to
03:37 - turn right but what degrees
03:40 - 90 supposed to say
03:50 - 190 nope
03:54 - zero no 9 is
03:58 - 90.
04:03 - so it's all right
04:07 - then we repeat things
04:17 - so
04:21 - uh and you made a sick
04:25 - square over here you can rename your
04:28 - project
04:31 - whatever you like i'll just name it t
04:36 - pretty good save your project to
04:39 - re mix your project press the remix
04:41 - button
04:42 - then it will say remix t so you mix the
04:45 - whole entire project
04:47 - by and adding your own color into it but
04:50 - i don't even need to remix because
04:52 - it's my own project so when
04:56 - it's saved you can go back here to check
04:59 - if it's
04:59 - saved right
05:04 - you go down
05:16 - right
05:22 - here
05:26 - see there is remix t t
05:30 - and c it's the same thing because i
05:32 - didn't change anything in
05:33 - mixed e because i pressed it we mix at t
