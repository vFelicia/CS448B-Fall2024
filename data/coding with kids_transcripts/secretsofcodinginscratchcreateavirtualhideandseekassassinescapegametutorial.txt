00:00 - welcome to recording with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia my name is andrew today
00:05 - we're in scratch
00:06 - in andrew's account cool stuff kid so
00:09 - today i'm going to show you my game
00:11 - assassin escape
00:13 - so first there's the background i
00:15 - uploaded
00:16 - the image from google because i couldn't
00:19 - find the right background
00:21 - from scratch okay so it's just like
00:25 - it looks like a black hole in the middle
00:27 - yeah it is a space
00:28 - background then i have the scratch cap
00:31 - which is the player
00:32 - so the up arrow down arrow left arrow
00:35 - and right arrow
00:36 - is like how you control it so change y
00:38 - and change
00:39 - x which are the x and y coordinates to
00:43 - move scratch cat
00:44 - so you can move scratch cat with your
00:46 - arrow keys or
00:48 - yeah you can only move them
00:51 - from your arrow keys and then when green
00:53 - flags look that means when you run it
00:55 - show then set health to one that means
00:58 - you have one health
01:00 - and forever if touching assassin dash
01:03 - goes which is the ghost's name like
01:06 - sprite name
01:07 - then set health to zero broadcast game
01:09 - over lol that's the message
01:11 - then hide out loud
01:15 - so it'll broadcast the message to the
01:17 - ghost
01:18 - no to game over to game over
01:21 - actually yeah then when
01:25 - green flag clicked reset timer so this
01:27 - is programming the time
01:29 - forever yeah if timer equals 20 that
01:33 - means 20 seconds
01:34 - then say you win for two seconds stop
01:37 - all so you'll stop the game so
01:41 - yeah so if you survive for 20 seconds
01:45 - then it'll say you win but it's a little
01:49 - hard
01:49 - to survive for 20 seconds because
01:52 - the ghost will teleport to an unknown
01:55 - place like anywhere
01:56 - on the screen
02:00 - yeah escape so now the ghost is code
02:03 - so when i receive game over lol hide
02:06 - because before i did this
02:09 - code and i tested it the game over would
02:13 - would show but the scratch cat and the
02:15 - ghost would still be here
02:16 - like it's over the game over screen so
02:19 - you can still see them
02:21 - okay so the other code is for the
02:24 - assassin and ghost is
02:25 - when green flag clicked show forever
02:28 - point forward scratch cat so
02:30 - point four sketch then go to random
02:33 - position
02:34 - wait one second then repeat so ghosts
02:37 - go to random position that is why it is
02:40 - hard
02:41 - to avoid the ghost because you do not
02:43 - know where it is
02:44 - going yeah
02:49 - and game over screen so i
02:52 - also uploaded the game over screen yeah
02:55 - game over so when
02:58 - green color clicked hi because if i did
03:02 - not
03:02 - hide it then it would be game over and
03:04 - the player was like
03:06 - what i did not do anything and then when
03:09 - i received the message game over lol
03:11 - you know show because it's game over
03:14 - then
03:15 - play sound clapping
03:21 - because like it was like good playing
