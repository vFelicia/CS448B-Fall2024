00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're
00:05 - gonna use chat GPT to make a simple game
00:07 - in Python So today we're gonna make a
00:10 - game called scrambles letter guessing
00:12 - game so first I just I asked chat GPC to
00:16 - create a simple game in Python that
00:18 - takes a list of words then you will show
00:21 - one of those words both this letter
00:23 - scrambled and then the player needs to
00:25 - guess the word within a limited number
00:28 - of tries and then this is the coaching
00:31 - made me but I wanted it to be more fun
00:34 - so I also asked chat to GPC to add on to
00:38 - the game so that there can be two
00:39 - players a limit of five guesses and More
00:42 - Words
00:45 - added more words and now two players can
00:48 - play so you can play with your friends
00:50 - and you don't have infinite guesses
00:54 - okay so let's review the code first we
00:57 - import a module called random so we can
00:59 - use some functions inside the module
01:01 - random then we're going to make a
01:03 - function called words with choose word
01:06 - then we're going to return the random
01:08 - that choice words so we're gonna in this
01:10 - function it's gonna choose one of the
01:12 - words in the list so we can guess that
01:16 - word then we have another function
01:17 - called scramble word and we have a
01:19 - variable called scrambled equal list
01:21 - word and then we're gonna Shuffle the
01:24 - scramble which are the letters of the
01:26 - words so it will be mixed up and then
01:28 - we're gonna return us
01:30 - um we're gonna make it a string then
01:33 - we're gonna have the main function game
01:35 - Loop
01:36 - so first we're going to create the word
01:38 - list you can also change this list or
01:40 - whatever words you want
01:42 - and when we have two names player one
01:45 - name and player two names so the code is
01:48 - going to ask player one enter your name
01:49 - and the same for player two then you can
01:51 - enter the name and it'll call you by
01:53 - that name we're going to create a
01:55 - variable called chosen word with the
01:58 - function choose word and then we're
01:59 - going to choose a random word from the
02:01 - list and store it in that chosen word
02:03 - variable
02:05 - then we're gonna we're gonna scramble
02:07 - that chosen word to end a mix up its
02:10 - letters I'm going to store that word in
02:12 - The Scrambled variable then we're going
02:14 - to print welcome to the word scrambled
02:16 - game then I'll do player one name so
02:19 - answer your player one name and then
02:21 - player two's name you will take turns
02:23 - guessing the word
02:25 - so it's introduced introducing the game
02:28 - right now yeah you have five guesses
02:30 - each can you unscramble this word and
02:32 - then it will show the scrambles word and
02:34 - then we're gonna Loop for Turner range
02:37 - one and six we're gonna print what turn
02:40 - it is then if turn
02:42 - is
02:45 - um two equals equals one we're gonna do
02:47 - player e a name equals player name
02:51 - so we're gonna figure out what which
02:53 - player's turn it is so it's player one
02:56 - then open player one and then player two
02:58 - and then we're gonna do player the uh
03:01 - guess equals input then we're gonna
03:03 - enter the player name whoever's turn it
03:05 - is and then your guess and then we can
03:07 - put our guess in there
03:10 - the in that variable then we're going to
03:12 - check if our guess is the chosen word so
03:15 - if it is we're going to bring
03:17 - congratulations then whichever player
03:19 - got it right you guessed the word
03:20 - correctly so here it's kind of a team
03:22 - game and you have to work together to
03:24 - guess the word you want to break if it
03:27 - if it isn't the chosen word horn else if
03:30 - turn is less than five that means
03:32 - instead of turns left we're gonna print
03:33 - oops that's not correct and then we're
03:35 - gonna give the player name you have five
03:38 - minus whichever turn it is so you can
03:41 - get the turn it actually is guess it's
03:44 - left
03:45 - else if that's we we have five turns I'm
03:50 - gonna print sorry the number player
03:52 - you've used all your guesses the correct
03:54 - word was and then we're gonna show the
03:56 - word
03:57 - and then here we're going to actually
03:59 - run the function
04:01 - so now let's see the code here in Visual
04:05 - Studio code now we're going to run it so
04:08 - do you want to be player one wait it's
04:12 - oh yeah okay
04:15 - create the terminal
04:18 - and then we're gonna do py scrambled
04:23 - letters
04:26 - game okay do you want to be player one
04:29 - yeah okay I'll enter my name
04:32 - and then Kalia will enter her name and
04:35 - then Andrea Kalia you will take turns
04:37 - guessing the word you have five guesses
04:39 - each can you unscramble this word so
04:41 - it's a pretty long word
04:46 - r-a-g-i-r-o-m-p-m-g-n should we look at
04:48 - the list of the words or not that'll be
04:50 - too easy because it takes a lot of words
04:56 - you should not know the words
04:59 - okay what should we get program
05:03 - no oops that's not correct wrote Andrew
05:07 - you have four guesses left so what's
05:08 - your programming
05:10 - Pro gram me congratulations clay you
05:15 - guessed the word correctly okay so now
05:17 - let's play it again so our list of words
05:20 - like are involved in Python and like and
05:24 - coding code
05:26 - okay so I won't enter our name
05:30 - you can no do I need a scramble this
05:33 - word
05:33 - a-i-l-e-v-r-a-b
05:37 - let's see I think I know what it is
05:42 - I do not know what that is do you know
05:44 - what that is yes what is it I think it's
05:47 - variable
05:48 - oh
05:50 - congratulations me I guess the week you
05:54 - asked me okay how about this okay you
05:57 - can also make this a one player game
05:59 - with 10 guesses or you can change the
06:01 - number of guesses I'm gonna change the
06:03 - words okay okay you don't look don't
06:06 - look
06:07 - look
06:12 - see
06:16 - no
06:21 - I'm gonna do a
06:26 - um
06:26 - let's see
06:31 - and
06:32 - we're gonna check
06:34 - okay
06:35 - yes okay okay so enter your name
06:40 - just enter my name
06:42 - I didn't add that many words
06:46 - Rush okay what's the player two's name
06:48 - dot dot dot okay
06:52 - okay can you unscramble this word r e e
06:54 - r i e t e t n n
07:00 - ah
07:03 - that's gonna be hard I don't know
07:06 - internet I don't think it's internet
