00:00 - welcome to pretty much kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in scratch
00:05 - in andrew's account techno468 so today
00:08 - i'm going to show you my project among
00:10 - us
00:10 - hide and seek so it's not really hide
00:13 - and seek
00:14 - but it's something let's show you it
00:17 - [Music]
00:20 - well profoundly remember to
00:24 - love and save okay now let's see
00:28 - so there's a o2 which is the background
00:32 - and i uploaded it from google then
00:35 - there's an avatar which is the imposter
00:38 - and just call it
00:38 - the imposter yeah because you only need
00:42 - to find one of them
00:43 - so when green flag clicked ill forever
00:46 - if
00:46 - mouse down so if you click and touch it
00:49 - mouse wonder
00:50 - so if like you're clicking on
00:53 - the imposter it will show because it's
00:56 - hiding
00:57 - then you'll say whoa you found me
00:59 - remember to
01:00 - love and faith and then stop everything
01:03 - because
01:04 - you just supposed to find him and
01:07 - the game ends and i also play a song
01:10 - lying to me
01:11 - and then when green flecks like it'll go
01:13 - to random position
01:14 - so it'll go to random spot every time
01:17 - you run it and it'll hide
01:20 - so to the scribble i also drew it just a
01:23 - scribble
01:24 - when green flag select wait one second
01:27 - and then glide 0.5 seconds to
01:29 - the imposter so start in the middle
01:33 - and then collide that means go to the
01:35 - imposter somewhere near the imposter
01:38 - then you click around the scribble
01:41 - to find the imposter so if we didn't
01:44 - have this scribble
01:46 - then it would be like super duper hard
01:49 - to find the imposter
01:50 - because the imposter would be anywhere
01:52 - and there's no clue where he will
01:54 - be so now let's play
01:58 - [Music]
02:02 - oh i found him you found me 1911
