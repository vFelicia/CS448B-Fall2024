00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia and my name is Andrew today we use
00:05 - chat chibi 2 to make a game in Python So
00:09 - today we're going to use Chastity BT to
00:11 - make a tic-tac-toe game so we ask it can
00:13 - you make a tic-tac-toe game Python and
00:16 - explain it to me like a python beginner
00:18 - so Chach GPT says certainly I'll provide
00:21 - a simplified version of a tic-tac-toe
00:23 - game in Python and explain the code step
00:25 - by step for beginners so then I'm gonna
00:28 - explain the code so first we're going to
00:30 - create empties Tic Tac Toe board so you
00:32 - can visualize the board and know where
00:34 - to put your x's and circles so I'm going
00:38 - to create a variable called board and
00:39 - create a list
00:41 - and we're gonna put empty spaces for in
00:45 - range three and then we're gonna keep
00:47 - doing it again I'm gonna do it again so
00:49 - we're going to create a three times
00:50 - three board
00:52 - then we're gonna create a function
00:54 - called print board to actually print the
00:56 - six axle board so there's board and then
00:59 - for row and board we're going to print
01:01 - the line to separate the spaces where
01:04 - you can put your excesses and your
01:07 - circles and also for the
01:10 - um the columns and the
01:14 - um rows then we're going to print the
01:16 - board
01:17 - then step three we're going to create a
01:19 - function to check if there is a win
01:22 - we're going to create a function called
01:23 - check win with board and player then
01:25 - we're going to first the check rows then
01:27 - we're gonna use a four Loop four row on
01:30 - board if all the cells which or spaces
01:33 - in each row equals equals player for
01:37 - cell and row that means if all the cells
01:38 - have the same
01:40 - in a certain row have the same um have
01:43 - the same symbol which is extra Circle or
01:46 - it'll return true if it if nobody want
01:50 - in a row it'll check for columns and it
01:53 - was basically the same code before
01:54 - columns and then it will return true if
01:57 - somebody won with a column if not it'll
02:00 - keep going and check diagonals in the
02:03 - for Loop
02:04 - so here if board zero zero which are
02:06 - coordinates for the small board zero
02:09 - zero equals equals board one one and
02:11 - then two two equals the player which is
02:13 - a symbol we're gonna run return true and
02:16 - we're going to do the same for the other
02:17 - diagonal and if still doesn't return
02:20 - true we're gonna return false because
02:22 - nobody won yet
02:23 - then I'm going to create the main game
02:26 - Loop is which is the loop where we
02:28 - actually run the game so I'm going to
02:30 - create the current player variable
02:32 - equals x because X goes first they want
02:35 - to have a while true Loop so step five
02:37 - get the current players move so we're
02:39 - gonna do create two variables row and
02:42 - column in which we will input our
02:44 - coordinates from one to two for the row
02:47 - and column
02:48 - then it'll store our input in the row
02:51 - and column variables step six check if
02:54 - the chosen cell is valid so you may
02:58 - um get an invalid cell like it's out of
03:00 - the board or somebody already put their
03:03 - P their symbol there so it'll check if
03:06 - board row call is not an empty space
03:09 - if an empty space then you can put it a
03:11 - bit but it says not empty space it'll
03:14 - print an invalid move please try again
03:16 - and then it'll continue step seven
03:18 - update the board with The Current
03:19 - player's move when the board roll call
03:23 - um equals current player and then next
03:25 - we're going to print the updated board
03:27 - we're going to Simply print board and
03:29 - then then we're going to check for a win
03:31 - after
03:33 - um a player
03:34 - puts their new symbol so if check when
03:36 - board and current player then if it's
03:38 - true it'll print player whichever player
03:42 - it is X or uh
03:44 - Circle or zero or o wins and it'll break
03:48 - and then step 10 we're gonna check for a
03:50 - tie if it passes the check for if it
03:53 - passes
03:55 - um a check for a win then if all cell is
03:58 - not
03:59 - um a space that means all cells are
04:01 - filled but I already checked if there's
04:04 - a win so there's no wind so it's a tie
04:06 - then I'm going to print it's a tie and
04:08 - break and if it's not a tie or a win
04:11 - we're gonna switch to Knicks player and
04:14 - then current player equals zero which is
04:16 - basically Circle then if current player
04:19 - equals equals x else X and then here we
04:22 - also got May check GPT to give us a
04:26 - simple explanation here which you can
04:28 - read and then it says that's it with
04:30 - this code players can take turns
04:31 - entering their moves and the game will
04:33 - check for wins and ties until there is a
04:35 - conclusive result so now we're going to
04:37 - put that code in Visual Studio code and
04:40 - you can see the code here and now me and
04:42 - Kalia are going to play a game so do you
04:44 - want to go first you go first okay let's
04:47 - see I like to play I'm very good
04:51 - it's row zero and then I'm six zero
04:56 - so now I have X your turn
04:59 - wow
05:01 - one
05:03 - and column one
05:06 - so one one that's the middle so not on
05:09 - the on the test and I'm gonna show you
05:12 - I'm gonna show you um
05:14 - if we enter in ballot positions
05:18 - six and eight
05:21 - so it's incorrect
05:26 - so
05:29 - and then you did one one one
05:32 - and then out to for example I already
05:35 - did
05:36 - um zero zero so we're gonna do zero and
05:39 - then zero then it says invalid move
05:41 - please try again so now I'm just gonna
05:43 - put it at
05:45 - and put it right here which is two
05:48 - two
05:49 - okay so now
05:52 - [Music]
05:53 - um
05:55 - hmm
05:58 - one
06:00 - Sarah
06:02 - so now she's threatened it so I have to
06:05 - block it which is
06:06 - one two
06:09 - okay now you're you have to block it now
06:11 - zero
06:13 - two
06:14 - no I have to block that the diagonal so
06:18 - I think it's gonna be it's hot yeah
06:20 - two
06:21 - zero
06:23 - okay so there are two more spaces
06:25 - two
06:29 - that's one
06:31 - one two one
06:32 - so now it's a tie so I have to do zero
06:36 - one so then it's that's hot let's play
06:40 - again
06:41 - you go first
06:43 - zero
06:44 - two
06:47 - um
06:49 - let's do two
06:52 - zero so I block the leg
06:57 - two
06:58 - two
07:03 - block it one
07:05 - two
07:09 - uh
07:11 - one
07:13 - one
07:15 - okay
07:17 - see so we block it here that's zero
07:22 - zero
07:24 - I think it's high again zero
07:29 - it has a tie
07:32 - two
07:33 - one
07:37 - zero
07:43 - one
07:44 - so now let's see if what happens if
07:47 - somebody wins so let's simply do zero
07:51 - zero and then this guy the the second
07:56 - player does two zero zero then I do one
08:03 - one so now I'm threatening Pretender
08:07 - dumb they do one
08:10 - zero and then if I'm gonna win I'm gonna
08:13 - do two two so then player X wins so if
08:18 - player Oh wins the LSA player Oh wins
08:21 - yeah so now you can try this out and
08:22 - play with people well that was fun and
08:26 - that's it for today thank you for
08:28 - watching Remember to smash the like
08:30 - button and subscribe bye bye
