00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to teach you python so
00:07 - today we're going to learn
00:09 - data types in python so first i'm going
00:12 - to create a new file
00:13 - called
00:28 - first going to use the type so type
00:31 - quotes 7 so type
00:34 - is going to print the
00:37 - the data type of
00:41 - what's inside the brackets okay then
00:44 - print oh wait first the seven
00:47 - is a string because it is yes see it
00:50 - says class string
00:52 - so it's going to print class string okay
00:55 - then
00:56 - print type
00:59 - inside is set so
01:02 - now we don't have the quotes and so it's
01:06 - going to be a
01:06 - it works right there yeah
01:10 - that
01:19 - so now we have 7.1 and that's a float
01:22 - because float
01:23 - has decimals so let's save it with ctrl
01:25 - s and
01:26 - internal type data
01:29 - py data dot py
01:33 - so it says class string class int class
01:37 - flow that's all correct the first one is
01:40 - a string the second one is an integer
01:42 - and the third one is a float then we're
01:45 - gonna
01:47 - uh delete this and do
01:52 - current
02:03 - true or false if something is that
02:06 - data type so in the brackets there will
02:09 - be codes then
02:10 - the quotes inside will be seven okay
02:19 - so it's gonna print true or false to
02:21 - this
02:22 - so in it is if this quote
02:26 - if the seven in the quote is a string
02:28 - everything we do
02:30 - print is instant
02:33 - is sent
02:36 - then there will be a seven and comma
02:39 - seven
02:40 - com comma then
02:44 - so now we're checking if the seven
02:46 - without the quotes is a
02:48 - integer then we do print
02:52 - is instant instance
02:55 - 7.1 7.1
02:59 - comma float float
03:06 - so now we're checking if the 7.1 is a
03:09 - flip
03:09 - so let's save it and run it
03:14 - oopsies so you can use the up arrow to
03:17 - copy what you last typed in terminal
03:19 - let's run it so this hits true true true
03:22 - because the seven encodes the string the
03:25 - seven
03:25 - without the quotes is an integer and the
03:28 - seven point one is a float
03:30 - okay so let's delete this
03:33 - and do print
03:37 - oopsies print is instant is
03:40 - instance seven
03:44 - seven comma string
03:47 - seven comma string okay so now we don't
03:50 - have the quotes for the seven
03:53 - and it was print false or true if it's
03:57 - um actually a string or not yeah so it's
04:00 - going to print false because
04:02 - strings have quotes then print
04:05 - print is instant this instance
04:10 - quotes with a 7 inside
04:19 - yeah so now it's going to check if the 7
04:21 - in the quotes
04:22 - is an integer it'll also print false
04:25 - because
04:25 - the 7 in the quotes is a string and the
04:29 - seven without the quotes is an inch okay
04:32 - then
04:33 - print is instant this instance
04:37 - i mean yeah it quotes
04:41 - quotes seven point one
04:44 - seven point one then comma
04:47 - float it's gonna print false because
04:50 - there are quotes yeah even if the is a
04:53 - seven point one but it's in quote is a
04:56 - string so it's going to print false to
04:58 - all these let's save it
04:59 - and run it oops
05:03 - okay so it says false false false
05:06 - because the seven
05:07 - without the quotes is not a string it's
05:09 - an integer
05:10 - yeah and the seven in the quotes is a
05:12 - string not an integer
05:14 - and the seven point one in the quotes is
05:17 - a string not a float
05:18 - so okay let's delete this and do print
05:22 - type
05:36 - so we're checking if seven is
05:40 - something straight straight so this is
05:43 - another way to check if something is a
05:46 - data type
05:47 - i would not recommend this because it's
05:49 - longer and
05:51 - i recommend you use the is instance
05:53 - function because this
05:55 - uh is better and it's easier to
05:59 - see then print print
06:02 - type function type
06:05 - seven seven then two equals
06:09 - equals eight and so now we're checking
06:12 - if the seven without the quotes is a int
06:17 - okay then we're gonna do
06:27 - [Music]
06:30 - so now we're checking the 7.1 is float
06:34 - okay let's save it and run it
06:39 - now it's true true true because they're
06:41 - all this one is a string because it's in
06:43 - size of quotes and the seven
06:45 - is an integer because as no quotes and
06:47 - it's a whole number
06:48 - and the 7.1 is a float it doesn't have
06:51 - any quotes
06:52 - yeah so the type function again
06:57 - the type seven
07:06 - so now we're going to check if the seven
07:09 - without the closest
07:10 - string is going to print false okay then
07:14 - type
07:22 - [Music]
07:27 - and so it's also going to prove false
07:29 - because if it has quotes is a string
07:32 - then we do print type
07:36 - type and that is quote
07:39 - 7.1 7.1 so this is string
07:43 - two because remember it has quotes then
07:46 - two equals seconds then float
07:49 - so it's all gonna print false because
07:52 - the string the seven
07:54 - does not have codes it's an integer yeah
07:57 - and the other ones has quotes so they're
07:59 - both strings not integers or floats
08:02 - so let's save it and run it
08:05 - because false because they're all not
08:08 - true
08:08 - yeah okay then i'm going to do x
08:12 - x equals
08:16 - codes as string string
08:19 - so this is a string because it has
08:21 - quotes then
08:34 - so it's going to print the type of
08:37 - all strings because so it's going to
08:40 - print a string
08:41 - because there are quotes so it's a
08:43 - string
08:46 - and then x equals seven x equals seven
08:49 - so this is an integer print print
08:53 - type type
08:56 - x x so we did the print
09:00 - just as like the top one but the x
09:03 - is a 7 now so it's going to print the it
09:06 - because it is an integer
09:09 - okay then print
09:13 - i mean it is
09:34 - and
09:39 - and that's it for today thank you for
