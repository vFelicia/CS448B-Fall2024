00:33 - luckily i have a
00:35 - i had a tow mid of undying but i lost my
00:38 - toenail
00:39 - dying that's why i don't like creepers
00:42 - i had to erase because um
00:45 - when i uploaded this picture it had a
00:48 - lot of white around it you can
00:50 - see it's transparent and there will be
00:53 - no
00:53 - right and then i have this
01:08 - and ghost and potion the arrow was
01:10 - supposed to be a
01:12 - [Music]
01:13 - diamond yeah a diamond
01:16 - and i really like it doesn't really look
01:19 - like a book because
01:20 - i erased some parts of it because
01:24 - it's i'm not a very bad eraser
01:28 - then tnt the creeper strategy
01:33 - because you know both of them explodes
01:38 - yeah so the originally the ghost shoot
01:42 - potions right yeah i don't know why
01:45 - then the line what's the line creeper
01:49 - so like the enemy yeah i
01:52 - also changed the health it was supposed
01:55 - to be 10
01:56 - it was so hard so i changed it to 15
02:01 - and when if there's still no creepers
02:04 - it may still shoot chance out of
02:08 - nowhere yeah so it's hard
02:11 - you also change the backdrop background
02:13 - right yeah
02:15 - is there any code in the background yes
02:20 - it's messages so when you get them
02:23 - okay uh wait wait where is it
02:27 - where is it okay so
02:31 - if you touch a tnt it will minus
02:34 - one health if you touching
02:37 - the creeper minus two so it's easy but
02:41 - you well the creeper go down so
02:45 - if you shoot a creeper you need them
02:49 - yeah before you before they touch you
02:53 - you can win but what if you shoot them
02:55 - they go down right what if they touch
02:57 - you you lose help
02:59 - that's harder but they like go straight
03:02 - down you can move away very fast
03:04 - and it's hard to move away
