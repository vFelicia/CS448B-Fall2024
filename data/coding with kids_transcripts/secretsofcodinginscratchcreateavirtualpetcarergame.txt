00:05 - in scratch and andrew's account
00:08 - techno468
00:10 - so we're going to show you my project
00:12 - virtual pet care
00:14 - so it's a virtual pet simulator and
00:17 - it's based on a tutorial so i have my
00:20 - octopus
00:21 - sprite which is the pet so
00:24 - the backdrop is the ocean and so when
00:28 - green flag click go to 2 minus 25
00:31 - x and minus 1 y so that's the setup and
00:35 - first let's show you it so it's playing
00:38 - the saw and it's called hello
00:40 - my name is octa so this is pet and
00:43 - there's a water bottle
00:45 - on a soccer ball a fish and here's the
00:48 - instructions
00:49 - so so there's also beer couples of
00:51 - hunger first and fun
00:52 - so i'm gonna go to the water bottle
01:00 - [Music]
01:07 - don't care about fun right now it can't
01:10 - make you die
01:13 - [Music]
01:23 - okay so this is my virtual pet simulator
01:26 - and
01:28 - this is the set of code so it goes to
01:30 - original place which is
01:32 - x y coordinates minus 25 x
01:35 - and y is minus one so it's right and
01:38 - right there at that position right now
01:40 - and i switched costume to octopus b
01:42 - which is the right now it's costume
01:44 - which is the
01:46 - original costume and say hello my name
01:48 - is octo i'm an
01:50 - octopus okay sounds like a broken
01:54 - robot i mean so now like is
01:57 - introduction and then when this sprite
02:01 - clicked repeat two times which costume
02:03 - to sing
02:06 - that's another costume where it's like
02:08 - right here
02:09 - it's like playing the p the drum right
02:12 - here
02:14 - okay then after
02:19 - yeah no after switching costume to sing
02:23 - it'll
02:24 - place that ocean wave and then wait
02:26 - three seconds then switch costume to
02:29 - coffee
02:30 - so it's like tired after it's done
02:33 - playing the drum and then say
02:35 - break ah and then play sound splash
02:39 - so this is the coffee is drinking coffee
02:42 - let me see
02:43 - it's drinking the coffee there's a
02:44 - problem yeah there was also pirate by
02:46 - dinner even
02:50 - okay so then when
02:54 - green flag clicked set hunger to zero
02:56 - forever change hunger by
02:58 - one wait five seconds so there's a
03:01 - hunger first
03:02 - and fun so you try to make the hunger
03:05 - for zero while the you try to make fun
03:10 - 10. if hunger or first reaches 10 you
03:13 - lose
03:14 - but if fun goes to 10 you win okay so
03:18 - setting hunger to zero and then changing
03:21 - hunger by one wait five seconds
03:23 - so each five seconds hunger will go up
03:26 - one
03:26 - okay first and foremost
03:29 - yeah okay so the button so this is like
03:32 - i did it in a different font
03:35 - and then if touching mouse pointer that
03:37 - means it's like my key is touching it
03:39 - or a mouse or you're if you're on the
03:41 - ipad or phone
03:42 - if your finger is touching it or if you
03:45 - tap it
03:46 - so before i ever do this and it'll just
03:50 - um show the words or the instructions
03:53 - for a few seconds let's go to the fish
03:56 - which is the food
03:57 - when this right click forecast food so
04:00 - it's a message
04:00 - it'll go to the octopus so the octopus
04:03 - will go to the fish
04:04 - so that's all for fish yeah but the
04:08 - octopus has a lot of code
04:10 - yeah so when you receive
04:13 - food that means the fish when you tap
04:15 - the fish now switch costume to artist b
04:18 - which is the usual costume
04:19 - and glide one second to fish that means
04:21 - it will go to fish
04:23 - for one second then place on chomp that
04:26 - means it eats it
04:27 - and then change hunger by minus one so
04:29 - hunger goes down
04:31 - and then wait 0.2 seconds guy one second
04:34 - to
04:34 - this original position so that's how
04:38 - you can feed the octopus let's go to the
04:41 - water bottle
04:42 - so when green flag collects first to
04:45 - zero
04:46 - then forever change first by one wait
04:48 - eight seconds
04:49 - so first goes up every eight seconds
04:53 - which is slower than hunger so
04:55 - it's not that like hard to win but
04:58 - hunger i wonder why we get hungry so
05:01 - fast
05:02 - okay let's go to octopus
05:08 - drink yeah so when i've received drink
05:10 - so which costume to octopus be just like
05:12 - the other signals
05:13 - or the messages and like the usual
05:17 - costume then glide one second to
05:19 - water bottle and then play some splash
05:23 - that means is drinking it and then
05:25 - change first by minus one so
05:27 - first goes down one wait 0.2 seconds
05:30 - didn't go to his original position and
05:33 - finally
05:34 - the soccer ball
05:38 - when green flag collects set fund to
05:40 - zero so
05:41 - zero then if fun equals ten
05:44 - then switch cost him to check that means
05:46 - lucky you win and then say you win
05:48 - thanks for playing for two seconds
05:50 - that means you won it you win if you
05:53 - reach
05:53 - the fun to 10 and then when this right
05:55 - click forecast
05:56 - play so play is the final message out of
06:00 - the free then when i receive
06:01 - play which cost them to the reasonable
06:03 - cost to glide one second to the soccer
06:06 - ball
06:06 - play sound fly off because it's like
06:09 - happy because it's playing soccer
06:12 - underwater and change fun by one so it
06:14 - goes up
06:15 - not like first and hunger because first
06:17 - and hunger oh
06:18 - they go up two but you try to get first
06:21 - and hunger down
06:22 - while you try to get fun up and then
06:25 - wait two
06:25 - seconds zero point two seconds then
06:27 - glide your original position
06:29 - then there's this bright one which is
06:31 - the virtual octopus pet like his name
06:34 - and then okay that's all
06:38 - okay now i'm going to try it first
06:41 - now it also plays a song the song is so
06:44 - crazy
06:47 - [Music]
06:53 - the first variable just went down and i
06:55 - also clicked it
06:56 - so so it went to the singing costume now
07:00 - getting coffee i'm gonna eat enough fish
07:03 - now
07:06 - to ate the fish and the hunger would
07:09 - went up so i played the sound
07:14 - chomp and i went down okay let's go to
07:17 - fun
07:22 - [Music]
07:26 - okay i'm gonna keep eating because i
07:28 - don't want okay i'm gonna go
07:30 - to clay water
07:33 - [Music]
07:34 - hunger hunger is like more dangerous so
07:37 - you keep your eyes on the variables
07:39 - because hunger will go up every five
07:42 - seconds while first goes up every eight
07:44 - seconds
07:45 - so here's the instructions and that's
07:46 - the name okay
07:48 - [Music]
07:50 - okay okay okay okay now your turn
08:00 - this is a little hard this is like every
08:03 - five seconds and five seconds come back
08:05 - [Music]
08:10 - so sometimes if you click before 0.2
08:13 - seconds
08:14 - it'll like go a little bit toward its
08:17 - original position
08:18 - but then it will go to what you clicked
08:21 - because
08:22 - like you tapped it already so it won't
08:24 - actually go
08:25 - back versus zero
08:29 - versus negative one you shouldn't go
08:31 - through this
08:32 - [Music]
08:35 - don't focus on first is negative one
08:41 - sometimes if you click um first or
08:44 - hunger
08:45 - the the right time like every eight
08:48 - seconds and you press it on the each
08:49 - second
08:50 - it'll like not change because it was go
08:53 - it's trying to go up but you
08:55 - pressed it so it goes down here
08:58 - you wouldn't see there's a check mark i
09:01 - go to water
09:03 - i mean thirst then play then food and
09:06 - repeat forever
09:08 - okay and thanks for watching remember to
