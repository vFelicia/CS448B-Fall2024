00:00 - welcome to kids
00:03 - my name is my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - on minecraft education
00:07 - edition so today we're going to learn
00:09 - about repeat loops so
00:10 - first i'm going to create a new world
00:14 - so okay
00:15 - [Music]
00:20 - okay on top of the tree oh we take flat
00:24 - damage
00:25 - okay okay so first we're gonna do coding
00:30 - so we're going to do chicken rain
00:32 - [Music]
00:33 - chicken rain everywhere so it says let's
00:36 - get started with coding in minecraft
00:38 - why not add some life to your world
00:40 - maybe a chicken no
00:41 - let's have lots of chicken so in this
00:43 - picture you see a bunch of chickens
00:46 - yeah raining from the sky so let's start
00:49 - so that
00:50 - says put and and on chat command and
00:52 - rename it to chicken so
00:54 - on checkman so if you type whatever
00:56 - right now
00:57 - one but we need to change it to chicken
01:00 - yeah
01:02 - so when you type chicken in the chat
01:04 - it'll do whatever is inside here
01:06 - then we're gonna do put and spawn to
01:08 - spawn and chicken at your position
01:10 - so when inside the on chat command
01:14 - so the code under the on chat command
01:16 - will run when you type chicken in the
01:17 - minecraft chat
01:19 - zero zero zero is the relative 3d
01:21 - position of the players there's gonna
01:23 - spawn one chicken
01:24 - right where you are so it says
01:28 - change the spawn position to ten blocks
01:30 - above your player
01:31 - so like if you don't if you do zero zero
01:34 - zero the chicken is gonna spawn right
01:35 - where you yeah
01:36 - so this is where the person is and then
01:39 - the chicken is right here
01:40 - like you they're in the same place
01:43 - they're same person
01:44 - so the second number in zero zero zero
01:47 - means ten blocks above the player like
01:50 - where the player is
01:51 - the dash symbol means that the chord in
01:54 - it
01:54 - is a relative to the player so we're
01:57 - going to change the middle 0
01:58 - to a 10.
02:02 - so it's the chicken spawns 10 blocks
02:04 - above the player not
02:05 - exactly where you are yeah go to
02:08 - minecraft press t in the
02:10 - to open the chat and enter chicken you
02:12 - should see a flying chicken
02:13 - chicken from the sky yes let's go
02:16 - to tea and type chicken
02:20 - chicken
02:23 - [Music]
02:34 - let
02:45 - let's go back to coding so next
02:49 - the chicken is lonely place a repeat
02:51 - loop around spawn to create a hundred
02:53 - chickens so if you don't have a repeat
02:55 - loop you need to like
02:56 - copy and paste it 100 times which is
02:59 - very tired or how many times you want to
03:02 - spawn that
03:03 - up so we're going to use a repeat loop
03:05 - to help us so we don't need to be
03:07 - so tired after yeah so repeat
03:10 - 50 times so to spawn 52
03:14 - this is well done you've completed your
03:16 - first mop so we're finish
03:18 - and then go to the chat and type chicken
03:25 - [Music]

03:45 - show you
03:46 - in python how it looks like it
03:49 - yeah so it says def on on chat for index
03:52 - and range 50
03:53 - go do mobs dot spawn chicken position 0
03:57 - 10 0 so it'll spawn chickens 50 chickens
