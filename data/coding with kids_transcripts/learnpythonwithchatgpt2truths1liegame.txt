00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Clea my name is Andrew today we're going
00:05 - to use chat gbt to make a game in Python
00:08 - So today we're going to ask chat gbt to
00:10 - make a two truths One Lie game in Python
00:14 - so there were lots of bugs after I asked
00:16 - it to make the code like the amount of
00:19 - statements what statements and things
00:21 - about the statements like mixing them up
00:23 - and not always guaranteeing one lie so
00:27 - now um don't look okay so first we're
00:30 - going to import the random module with
00:33 - so we can use functions inside of it for
00:35 - our game then we're going to define a
00:37 - function called truth truth and a lie so
00:40 - we're going to create two um lists
00:42 - truths and lies with aot bunch of
00:44 - statements in them then we're going to
00:47 - do a wild true Loop you can
00:49 - look we're going to randomly select one
00:52 - line and two truths so we're going to
00:53 - random that shuffle both truths and Li
00:55 - list then we're going to store the lie
00:57 - in a variable called lie and it's it's
01:00 - going to get the first statement that
01:02 - comes up in the LI list then we're going
01:04 - to store a truth in a variable called
01:06 - Truth
01:07 - sample and we're going to use random do
01:10 - sample and pick two random statements
01:12 - out of the truth list so here we're
01:14 - using functions from the random module
01:17 - then we're going to combine both our
01:18 - truths and lies in a variable called
01:21 - statements for game then we're going to
01:23 - shuffle those statements so they don't
01:24 - always come out in the same order like
01:26 - the LIE always goes first then we're
01:29 - going to print here three statements
01:31 - then it's going to repeat three times
01:33 - and it's going to print one statement
01:35 - each time then we're going to print
01:38 - which statement is the LIE enter the
01:40 - number so each number will be paired
01:42 - with a statement and you need you need
01:44 - to um enter the number that matches the
01:47 - statement you think is a liot then if
01:50 - one is less or equal to guess and guess
01:52 - is less than equals to three so if guess
01:57 - is a certain number then it'll say
01:59 - you're correct that's statement is the
02:00 - LIE else if it's not they'll say sorry
02:04 - that's not the lie if it's still not ill
02:06 - print please enter a valid number 1 2 or
02:09 - three then we're going to do play again
02:11 - equals input do you want to play again
02:13 - then you can answer yes or no if what
02:16 - you ENT is not yes then it'll
02:19 - break if it's yes then you'll repeat
02:22 - here then here we run the function so
02:25 - now let's play it okay do you want to go
02:28 - first you go first okay so here are
02:30 - three statements bananas grow on trees
02:33 - the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest of
02:35 - all oceans and bees can see ultraviolet
02:38 - light which statement is a lie which one
02:40 - do you think number one number
02:43 - one you're correct that statement is a
02:46 - lie do you want to play again sure yes
02:48 - so now Kia can go here are three
02:50 - statements diamonds can only be
02:52 - scratched by other diamonds there moon
02:54 - is about 1 six the size of Earth and the
02:56 - Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest of all
02:58 - the oceans which statement is lie I
03:01 - think it's number two number two yeah
03:04 - okay sorry that's not the lie so it's
03:07 - number one that's crazy okay let's play
03:11 - again now it's my
03:13 - turn oh I already know it's one but
03:15 - there's also new statements honey is the
03:17 - only natural food that never spoils
03:20 - Antarctica is the windiest continent
03:23 - under Earth that's like um reasonable
03:28 - I'm going to dud number one you're
03:29 - correct that statement is a lot now
03:31 - let's do it again and Kalia can go okay
03:34 - honey is the only natural food that
03:36 - never spoils the Atlantic Ocean is the
03:37 - salest of all the oceans the Great Wall
03:41 - of China can be seen from space since we
03:42 - already have had the first two ones I'll
03:45 - choose free okay you're correct that
03:48 - statement is the lie you can't see the
03:49 - Great Wall of China so let's do one
03:56 - more oh it's also one
04:00 - last one
04:04 - oops okay go a group of owls is called a
04:07 - parle a mon koalas are not actually
04:10 - bears and honey is the only natural food
04:12 - that never spoils so we know three is um
04:15 - a truth so which one one or two I think
04:17 - it's two two koals are not actually
04:20 - Bears I koals are
04:22 - bears you're correct that stimon is a
04:25 - lot Ks are bears that's crazy okay you
04:29 - can also change the statements with
04:31 - statements of your own and statements
04:33 - about you or another person well that
04:36 - was fun and that's it for today thank
04:39 - you for watching Remember to smash the
04:41 - like button and subscribe
04:43 - byee
