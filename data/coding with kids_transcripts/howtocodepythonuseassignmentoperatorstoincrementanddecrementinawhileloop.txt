00:00 - welcome to recording with kids my name
00:03 - is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to teach you python so
00:07 - today we're going to learn about the
00:09 - while loop
00:09 - you first want to do count equals zero
00:12 - so count is a variable
00:14 - then we'll do while count is not five so
00:16 - exclamation equals
00:19 - is not so what keep repeating whatever
00:23 - is in the while loop until count
00:24 - is so in the while loop there's count
00:28 - plus equals one so add one to count
00:31 - so it's the same as count equals count
00:34 - plus one
00:35 - so on the first time it iterates the
00:37 - while loop
00:38 - count will become one after adding one
00:41 - to
00:41 - count we'll print count so keep
00:45 - adding one and then printing count until
00:48 - count
00:48 - is five and then stop so let's start at
00:51 - zero yeah but in the while loop it'll
00:55 - add one so
00:56 - it'll start printing one not zero let's
00:59 - save it with control s
01:00 - go to terminal and type t y wall
01:04 - to dot p y and run so let's see
01:08 - it printed one two three four and five
01:12 - so it printed all the numbers from
01:15 - one to five and when count was five it
01:18 - stopped
01:19 - because the while loop starts when
01:22 - count is five yeah so count is a
01:26 - variable
01:27 - yeah and it worked
01:30 - so we're going to keep using the count
01:32 - equal
01:33 - zero and print count so we're going to
01:36 - change the wall to
01:38 - wall count is less than 20 or equal to
01:42 - yeah then count plus equals three so add
01:45 - free to count
01:46 - so keep repeating this until count is
01:49 - greater than 20.
01:50 - let's save it go to terminal and run it
01:53 - so you can
01:54 - use up here to copy what you last typed
01:57 - in terminal
01:58 - so it printed let's see
02:01 - 3 6 9 12
02:05 - 15 18 21 so why did it print to 21
02:09 - well after it printed the 18 it checked
02:12 - the wall again
02:13 - so 18 is still less than 20 so it added
02:17 - free to count
02:18 - which is 21. yeah 18 plus 21 equals
02:22 - i mean 18 plus 3 it was 21
02:25 - yeah and then printed 21 so check the
02:28 - wall
02:28 - again but 21 is more than 20
02:32 - so it stopped like this oh let me see
02:35 - hmm oh it's 21 stop the loop
02:39 - okay that worked so now we're in still
02:44 - prints the count we're going to do count
02:47 - equals 20. so now the count variable is
02:50 - 20
02:51 - and then while count is greater
02:54 - than or equal to zero then
02:57 - count minus equals three so now we're
03:00 - subtracting
03:01 - free from count so on the first time it
03:04 - iterates
03:05 - the while loop count will become 17 and
03:08 - then it will print
03:09 - 17 and repeat until count is less than
03:13 - zero so let's save it go to terminal
03:16 - and run it so let's see
03:19 - what it printed so i printed
03:23 - 17 14 11 8 5
03:26 - 2 and negative one so it printed a
03:29 - negative root one
03:31 - because after printed the two i checked
03:33 - the wall again
03:34 - and two is still more than zero so
03:37 - subtracted
03:38 - three from two which is negative one
03:41 - and then imprinted negative one and
03:44 - check the wall again
03:45 - but negative one is less than zero so
03:47 - it's stopped
03:51 - i'm stopping that worked
03:55 - now we're going to tell you the operator
03:57 - and the purpose
03:58 - so equals is a sign and then plus equals
04:01 - is
04:02 - add in the sign minus equals is
04:04 - subtracting a sign
04:06 - star equals is multiply then sign
04:09 - and forward slash equals is divide then
04:11 - assign percentage
04:13 - equals is get the model as then assign
04:16 - and the star star
04:17 - equals is perform exponent then assign
04:20 - and thank you for watching remember to
04:23 - smash it
04:24 - up and subscribe bye
