01:13 - we want to make it confusing
01:17 - but there's already another chicken you
01:20 - will see
01:21 - drop gun powder because when creepers
01:24 - explode they actually
01:26 - drop gun powder in minecraft so
01:29 - when used flash explode when
01:32 - attacked flash explode one day add one
01:34 - score because you survived a creeper
01:37 - then one night at one score because you
01:39 - survived again
01:40 - but what if the creeper disappeared
01:43 - it dies and then you won't get a score
01:48 - that's sad yes because when spawn it
01:50 - won't add you a score
01:52 - so night spawn zombie and everything
01:56 - down so it will be near the house
02:00 - make it bigger make it bigger this is
02:03 - where they will spawn
02:05 - okay bigger then one day spun
02:08 - everything in the middle

02:26 - [Music]
02:28 - minecraft one it was i was very confused
02:33 - that
02:34 - i thought it was the cow whistling moon

02:39 - there's also a cow
02:42 - oh yeah they play different sounds then
02:44 - when
02:45 - touch drop iron ingot because the angle
02:48 - is made of iron but there's no iron
