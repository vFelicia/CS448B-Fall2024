03:42 - need the emeralds I fought a challenge
03:44 - like this would make a great video for
03:46 - my channel just like how we are doing it
03:48 - okay so search frame for particles again
03:50 - oh there's something oh hello is someone
03:53 - there oh my a human do you think you can
03:55 - help me I can't seem to open this door
03:57 - but Forefront I think my code may be
04:00 - broken do you think you could take a
04:02 - look and see what's wrong with it yes
04:04 - great if you can get me out of here I
04:07 - will return the flavor and help you
04:08 - escape the attic which programming
04:10 - language would you like to use so
04:12 - there's a blocks in Python you're going
04:14 - to use Python but if you're like a
04:16 - beginner in coding we recommend you to
04:18 - use blocks okay python okay first see
04:21 - that cursor over there on the floor it
04:23 - needs to move forward three blocks to
04:25 - reach the trapdoor but it isn't working
04:26 - press C to view the code okay so there's
04:29 - this is the cursor so and the agent is
04:33 - inside here we need to open the vent
04:35 - door to let it out okay see
04:40 - the box with the arrow on the floor is
04:42 - your cursor so use the cursor to
04:44 - manipulate block to solve puzzles
04:46 - throughout this experience in this
04:48 - activity you'll use it to open the
04:49 - trapdoor and release the agent use move
04:52 - the move cursor function to position the
04:55 - cursor and open trapdoor to open the
04:57 - trap door you have selected the move
05:00 - cursor function takes one parameter that
05:02 - defines its direction that parameter is
05:05 - the color of the area that represents
05:06 - the direction you want to move ballot
05:09 - directions are orange which is forward
05:11 - so you can put orange inside the
05:13 - parentheses to make the function uh
05:16 - to make the cursor move a Direction so
05:18 - this is a good example let's see what it
05:20 - does
05:21 - so
05:22 - it goes move oh okay Sports and then try
05:26 - to open it but it doesn't work no that's
05:30 - not quite right the cursor needs to move
05:32 - to this tractor and tell the two of them
05:34 - okay so let's go see it to code so this
05:37 - block doesn't work so this code doesn't
05:39 - work
05:40 - so we need to move the cursor so it's
05:42 - positioned above the wooden trap door
05:44 - okay so we need to move
05:47 - so this is wrong this code is not
05:49 - correct and then we have to move cursor
05:51 - one more time to reach the trapdoor like
05:54 - right underneath it underneath our
05:56 - cursor
05:57 - Orange
05:59 - oopsies
06:02 - don't ever spell anything wrong when
06:04 - you're doing coding language or else
06:06 - there will be something wrong with it
06:07 - okay so we need to move cursor three
06:10 - times forward and then open the trap
06:12 - door so we're one two three open
06:15 - great great it's open that's strange I
06:18 - still can't seem to get out can you
06:20 - check the code again and make sure I'm
06:21 - moving up two blocks okay now we open a
06:24 - trap door but the agent still needs to
06:26 - get up okay
06:28 - I wonder who trapped it there oh now
06:30 - that the trap door is open you'll need
06:32 - to move the agent up two blocks instead
06:34 - of three use the Asian dot move function
06:36 - to move the agent up the Aging dot move
06:38 - function takes one parameter that
06:40 - defines what direction it should move in
06:42 - five directions are forward back left
06:44 - right up and down so this is a code
06:46 - example so agent dot move up so only
06:49 - moves up one time so that doesn't work
06:52 - so let's try to in so over here is where
06:55 - we coat it so it moved already one up
06:59 - but has to move two times so let's do it
07:01 - my agent
07:06 - that repeat it so it's two times then
07:09 - he'll come up
07:12 - okay uh
07:14 - up
07:16 - not anything else but up okay
07:20 - thank you you fix my code now I'm in
07:23 - Rage open the green door for you the
07:26 - pathway Behind the Green Door is an
07:27 - easier one you can take that path or
07:30 - talk to me again if you want to try
07:31 - opening the yellow so there are doors
07:34 - here I think that's the yellow door oh
07:36 - there's something over here I think it's
07:37 - a red
07:39 - and that that sounds like
07:42 - it's another group so in our next video
07:45 - we're gonna go into the green portal but
07:47 - for now we're not it looks very serious
07:50 - look at our characters oh right so that
07:53 - first person we saw in the beginning is
07:55 - us so it's like so mysterious
08:00 - okay let's wait for that video well that
08:04 - was fun and that's it for today thank
08:06 - you for watching Remember to smash the
08:09 - like button and subscribe bye bye
