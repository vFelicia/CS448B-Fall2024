00:00 - welcome to recording with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:06 - today we're in fix code
00:08 - so here it says code favorite this is
00:11 - impossible
00:11 - so this video is going to be about
00:14 - turning
00:15 - accurately description this example will
00:18 - show how to
00:19 - use different drawings every train
00:22 - turning block to control the robot
00:24 - playground grid map
00:26 - so first we're gonna do turn
00:29 - right then wait four seconds
00:32 - so it'll turn right for four seconds
00:38 - okay then we need to stop
00:42 - driving so turn right for four seconds
00:44 - then start driving for one second
00:51 - then we're gonna turn left for 180
00:55 - degrees
00:57 - oopsies wrong block turn
01:00 - left for 180 degrees
01:10 - okay for one
01:13 - then wait one second
01:19 - so after it turns left for 180 degrees
01:22 - he's gonna wait one second
01:24 - then turn to rotation
01:27 - zero degrees so
01:31 - so it will um turn back to when it
01:33 - started like facing
01:34 - forward so see the platform codes add
01:38 - more codes when we add more codes
01:40 - here so let's go to the background now
01:48 - so it will run all the python code
01:51 - because the python code
01:53 - is same as the codes
01:56 - behind the page let's run it
02:02 - so first it will turn right for four
02:06 - seconds
02:09 - three four
02:12 - then turn left 180 now it's going back
02:16 - to
02:17 - zero so zero is just like when you start
02:20 - let's do it in 3d mode okay
02:23 - good okay turn right for
02:27 - four seconds
02:30 - turn the left for 180 degrees
02:34 - and then turn to rotation zero
02:37 - yay it works and thanks for watching

02:45 - bye bye
