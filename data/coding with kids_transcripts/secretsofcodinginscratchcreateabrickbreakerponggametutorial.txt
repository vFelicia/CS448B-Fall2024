00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - in scratch
00:06 - and in my account get that code one two
00:09 - three so this is what my
00:12 - game i made is called brick
00:15 - that rhymes that rhymes
00:19 - brick breaker is a silly name because it
00:24 - rhymes
00:26 - game over you touched a red line it's
00:29 - like a palm
00:30 - yeah so over here when i receive
00:33 - bounce that's the ball sprite yeah so
00:36 - bounce is a message
00:38 - point in direction one
00:42 - minus
00:48 - so move ten steps so if it's not
00:50 - touching the paddle it will move ten
00:52 - steps
00:55 - one click green
01:03 - [Music]
01:06 - yeah i can even do is
01:14 - [Music]
01:24 - because it's under one is
01:28 - not really getting a number yeah
01:31 - then when green sag clicked forever
01:34 - it's touching line then broadcast came
01:38 - over that means the red line
01:41 - yeah the red line right here when green
01:44 - frog click
01:44 - go to x zero y zero that
01:47 - is is x y coordinate that means
01:51 - uh the middle yeah point in direction
01:54 - 135
01:55 - then wait one seconds and forever remove
01:58 - ten steps
01:59 - if on edge bounce if you don't have the
02:01 - code it's going to
02:02 - get out of the screen but when you green
02:05 - fox like it'll
02:06 - go here again then it's touching paddle
02:09 - broadcast
02:11 - that means if it touches like you then
02:14 - it will broadcast
02:15 - into itself and
02:18 - yep then game over game over
02:27 - that means just the same place the ball
02:29 - starts yeah and when i receive the
02:32 - message game over the show
02:41 - when green flag clicked set rotation
02:44 - style
02:44 - don't rotate yeah
02:47 - go to x 130 y
02:50 - minus 140 that means where kind of where
02:54 - it is now
02:55 - yeah but point towards mouse pointer
02:59 - both 10 steps set y 2 minus 140 so
03:04 - point forwards mouse pointer it will
03:06 - like you'll follow your mouse pointer
03:09 - yeah but and not rotate so it'll go in a
03:12 - straight line like this
03:13 - but if you did not do set rotation style
03:17 - don't rotate
03:18 - then your paddle would like follow your
03:20 - key all around it could go
03:22 - just past the ball and go through line
03:25 - [Music]
03:30 - everywhere
03:39 - it's kind of hard to say when bringing
03:42 - that click
03:42 - hide so it's not there
03:46 - there's uh it's gonna create clones so
03:49 - let's set score to zero it's a
03:51 - variable variable yeah and you can see
03:54 - it
03:55 - you can see it right there
03:59 - set size to 50 you don't want it too big
04:03 - yeah go to minus 200
04:06 - y 140 so that's just x y coordinates
04:10 - and then repeat four times four times
04:14 - seven times clone of myself change
04:17 - x by 65. that means it will place
04:20 - a clone of itself that means a copy of
04:23 - itself
04:23 - every 65 x coordinate there's six
04:28 - x two minus two hundred change y
04:31 - by minus three hundred whatever
04:34 - it makes twenty eight clones
04:37 - okay so you can just do repeat twenty
04:40 - eight times
04:41 - but yeah when i start at the clinic
04:45 - that means this is programming the
04:46 - clones
04:48 - forever if touching ball then broadcast
04:50 - bounce
04:51 - again yeah score
04:54 - by one and then delete this clone
04:57 - because
04:57 - you broke the brick like this
05:04 - you win sprite
05:07 - the enemy of the game over sprite
05:11 - okay so when green flag clicked go to
05:15 - x zero y zero same as the game mode the
05:19 - ball
05:19 - and the game over and hide set score to
05:22 - zero
05:23 - wait until score equals 28 because
05:25 - there's 28
05:26 - bricks show then stop
05:29 - so that means it'll show you win
05:33 - that means the player will know that he
05:35 - won yeah and then yeah
05:38 - then the line when green flag clicks
05:42 - show so when the ball touches the red
05:45 - line
05:46 - it'll stop all and the game over will
05:50 - show
05:50 - okay
05:55 - the ball is originally red the
05:57 - background also changes color and plays
05:59 - the music
06:00 - oh yeah i
06:03 - don't make it game over
06:25 - but i did it in a special kind of way
06:27 - it's like
06:28 - sunset if it's that color
06:32 - one green frog cake forever replace down
06:35 - dance chill out it's a
06:37 - song i got from scratch yep
06:40 - forever i like it
06:43 - it's kind of relaxing but not so
06:46 - relaxing
06:47 - the bricks are called if you can find
06:49 - them in the sprite library or scratch
06:51 - yeah you can find all of these sprites
06:54 - in there
06:55 - except the game over and over because i
06:58 - literally typed that
06:59 - yeah it's just a few words
07:03 - i always died like always released when
07:06 - i
07:07 - almost oh i did two of them when you
