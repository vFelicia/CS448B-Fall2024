00:16 - bit so we have began to build more
00:17 - office space
00:18 - however we need the process to go faster
00:20 - that is why we are developing a piece of
00:22 - software that will automatically make
00:24 - complicated structures out of blocks
00:26 - we are experiencing some problems can
00:28 - you help so we're going to help the ceo
00:31 - now talk to
00:34 - the programmer okay so the programmer
00:38 - says hello can you help me with this
00:40 - i need to make different blog types
00:41 - appear in the dedicated areas
00:43 - but for some reason sometimes the wrong
00:45 - block type appears
00:46 - can you write some code to place a grass
00:48 - block on the grass and bricks on the
00:49 - brick
00:50 - okay so first we're going to stand on
00:53 - top of the grape
00:56 - then we're gonna do
00:59 - this so this
01:02 - will place a grass block at our feet
01:05 - because we are standing on the grass
01:06 - block it will
01:07 - place the grass block on top of the
01:08 - grass so it did correct
01:24 - so now i'm
01:34 - [Music]
01:39 - hi would it be possible to get your help
01:41 - you should put resident lamps and those
01:43 - fittings
01:43 - on the ceiling but it can't seem to get
01:45 - the required height correct
01:47 - you write some code to place the free
01:49 - lamps at the correct height using these
01:50 - scales next to each of them
01:52 - once you've done this go ahead and turn
01:53 - them off so
01:55 - first we are going to stand on the gold
01:57 - box let's see
01:59 - let me change the middle number
02:03 - and also change the block so first we're
02:05 - going to change the brass block
02:08 - to red stone lamp
02:12 - then i'm going to change the middle
02:14 - number let's try
02:17 - five to see if it's high enough yeah
02:21 - okay okay it's not high enough let's try
02:24 - six so now we're gonna change the
02:28 - five to a six so let's see if it's high
02:31 - now
02:31 - yeah then we're gonna turn on the lights
02:34 - okay now we get it correct so we're
02:36 - gonna turn the lever on
02:37 - and turn on the lights next we are gonna
02:40 - go to
02:42 - this gold block and we're trying this
02:44 - this one looks
02:45 - taller so we're gonna try seven
03:01 - okay correct now i'm gonna turn the
03:03 - lever right over here
03:05 - to turn on the lights that's much
03:07 - brighter yeah we're going to do the last
03:09 - light
03:09 - right here so this one looks closer
03:12 - we're going to try
03:13 - for it
03:17 - let's see

03:30 - see engineer says could i ask for your
03:32 - help i need to build a staircase
03:34 - starting after the gold
03:35 - but it never comes out right can you
03:37 - write some code that will place a
03:38 - staircase made out of three steps
03:40 - okay so first we are gonna do
03:45 - the place block again and we're going to
03:47 - change the block again
03:49 - so we're going to change the grass block
03:51 - into a
03:53 - work then we're going to turn the last

05:32 - negative one so now we're gonna run
05:35 - to make the first so it's correct so
05:39 - next we're gonna turn it into
05:43 - negative two we're not going to change
05:45 - the middle number
05:46 - so now we're gonna run again okay
