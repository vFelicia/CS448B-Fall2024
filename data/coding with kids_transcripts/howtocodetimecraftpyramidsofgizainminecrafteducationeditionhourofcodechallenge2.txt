00:00 - welcome to cody with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:06 - education edition and in time craft so
00:09 - we until we chose our second split which
00:11 - is the
00:12 - the pyramid of giza so it's front like
00:16 - it's page it's just like um a cube yeah
00:20 - so the problem is that it's a cube and
00:22 - it slowly collapses yeah it's the right
00:24 - thing
00:25 - this monument must be giant to honor
00:27 - king coop
00:28 - but this cube continues to collapse
00:30 - under its own weight there must be
00:32 - another shape that works okay
00:35 - so now we need to build a triangle for
00:37 - the archetype since we have our eight
00:40 - here so first code we need
00:43 - and move forward not back or else you go
00:46 - backwards
00:47 - and place
00:50 - back yes okay let's try and move forward
00:55 - you need to do a four and then three and
00:57 - then two and then one no we only
01:00 - need to make one more log up here
01:02 - because it doesn't look like two blocks
01:04 - okay
01:05 - then you move up
01:07 - or else you're just going to be on the
01:09 - same level
01:18 - and then now you need to reverse this
01:20 - code except you need to
01:22 - move
01:24 - backwards
01:26 - how many times
01:28 - one two two times two times
01:32 - two
01:34 - okay
01:36 - and we can remove that and then we
01:39 - okay i'm just going to go back
01:43 - i think we should move back one more
01:45 - time to please just move out there are
01:47 - many ways yeah but we'll just move back
01:50 - one time
01:52 - okay move
01:53 - back
01:54 - one
01:55 - place forward forward not back
01:59 - there
02:01 - forward okay

02:20 - think of it yeah that should take the
02:22 - edge off amazing work you've prepared
02:24 - this moment in time using the power of
02:26 - code yes scanning
