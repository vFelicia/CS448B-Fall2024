00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - claudia
00:04 - and my name is andy today we're gonna
00:05 - teach you python
00:07 - today we're gonna teach you a string
00:09 - helper function
00:10 - so first i'm gonna create a file i'm
00:13 - gonna name it
00:15 - p y and first we want to do
00:18 - message message
00:23 - equals string.capitalized
00:28 - first message
00:32 - then print message
00:37 - message equal second
00:42 - message
00:44 - capitalize
00:48 - and print message
00:54 - message equals third message
01:03 - print message
01:08 - dot capitalize
01:11 - so the capital string helper function
01:14 - is going to make the first letter of the
01:18 - of the message into a capitalize so
01:20 - right here in the first message
01:22 - the first letter is the f so it's going
01:24 - to capitalize the f
01:26 - the s right here and the t right here
01:28 - okay
01:29 - let's save it with ctrl s
01:32 - and go to the terminal type
01:36 - p y help dot p
01:39 - y
01:43 - o it's p y helper dot p
01:46 - y it says first semester second message
01:49 - and third message
01:50 - with the first letters capitalized so
01:52 - we're gonna delete this
01:58 - and do message equals hello world
02:06 - print message dot lower
02:12 - imprint message
02:17 - dot upper
02:20 - to the upper so the upper function
02:23 - will make all the letters uppercase yeah
02:26 - and the
02:27 - work will make all the letters lowercase
02:31 - the message equals message message.title
02:38 - the title function will make the first
02:42 - the first letters of each word into a
02:45 - capitalize
02:46 - then print message
02:53 - then print message dot
02:59 - swap case
03:03 - so the swap case function or swap
03:07 - is going to swap the lowercase to
03:09 - uppercase and the uppercase to
03:11 - do a lowercase let's save it
03:15 - and you can use your up arrow to copy
03:18 - what you last typed in this formula
03:20 - okay it says hello world hello world
03:22 - hello world hello
03:23 - so the first one is all lowercase then
03:26 - the next one
03:27 - is with the upper functions so they're
03:29 - all uppercase
03:31 - then the next one is has title function
03:34 - so the first letters of each word is
03:37 - upper case
03:38 - and the swap case is
03:41 - swapping the title the first one the
03:44 - first letters of each word are lowercase
03:46 - and the other
03:47 - letters in the word are uppercase
03:51 - which looks weird for me yeah i'm going
03:53 - to delete this
03:55 - and do location
03:58 - equal mississippi
04:05 - and print location
04:11 - don't count
04:14 - s so the account function
04:18 - is going to count how many of a letter
04:21 - is in mississippi yeah in mississippi
04:25 - so how many s's are in mississippi
04:41 - so many letters
04:44 - in this string
04:50 - so the length function is gonna count
04:52 - how many like letters
04:54 - is in this string in the print okay it's
04:56 - including spaces
04:57 - yeah okay then i'm gonna save it
05:01 - and run it 32
05:05 - yeah there's 32 of them
05:13 - race car
05:25 - okay then print
05:28 - message starts with
05:33 - r
05:37 - print message doc
05:41 - starts with a a
05:46 - and print message
05:49 - don't start swift
05:56 - so the star wars function
06:00 - is gonna like return a true or false
06:03 - depending if it's true or false if the
06:06 - word
06:06 - is start with the r the word start with
06:10 - a or start with
06:11 - r a okay
06:18 - message
06:31 - then print message that ends with
06:36 - a i
06:40 - so the invest function is just like the
06:42 - starts with function
06:43 - except the inverse function if it ends
06:46 - with that
06:47 - yeah okay so let's save it and then
