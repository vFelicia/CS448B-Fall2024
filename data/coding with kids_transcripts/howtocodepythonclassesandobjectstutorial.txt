00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:05 - python
00:06 - so today we're going to learn about
00:07 - classes so first we're going to do class
00:10 - car
00:10 - so class is a blueprint for objects
00:14 - which are things we
00:15 - build so first we have a class called a
00:17 - car
00:18 - then we're deaf which is defined in it
00:21 - so in it is a constructor
00:22 - which will help us construct the class
00:24 - call so then we have variables or
00:27 - attributes
00:28 - that describe the object
00:31 - so which are color here make and model
00:33 - for a cop
00:35 - i'm going to do self.co self.color
00:38 - equals color
00:39 - and the same for year make it mod and
00:41 - we're going to do
00:42 - def which is defined again show cars so
00:44 - so this is a function or we can call
00:47 - it a method so the method
00:50 - is called show call then when we
00:54 - run the method it will print color
00:57 - colon and self.color and the same for
01:00 - year
01:00 - make and model then we're going to do
01:03 - car 1 which is the variable equals then
01:06 - the class car
01:07 - gray 2005 honda and pi so we're
01:11 - doing the color year and making model
01:14 - then we're going to do a car 2
01:16 - which is red 2010 jeep com
01:19 - pass these are two cops then we're going
01:22 - to make a list
01:23 - called cars with car 1 and car 2 and
01:27 - then we're going to print cars 1 dot
01:30 - color and cars
01:31 - 0. color so we're going to print the
01:33 - colors of car 1 and car 2 but why do we
01:36 - need the 1
01:37 - and 0 it's because we need to specify
01:39 - which item
01:40 - you want to get the color out of in the
01:43 - list cars
01:44 - so lists are in x 0 so the first item
01:47 - has
01:48 - index of 0 and the second item has an
01:50 - index of 1 and so on
01:52 - so we're going to print the colors we're
01:54 - going to save it and
01:55 - so dead red and gray so that is correct
01:58 - because those are the colors of car 1
02:00 - and car 2.
02:01 - they're going to do car 2 that show car
02:04 - so we're going to use the show car
02:05 - function
02:06 - another way to do it is to do the class
02:09 - car
02:09 - that showcase the function then specify
02:12 - which one
02:13 - cartoon now receive it and
02:17 - so it did see so i did
02:21 - color red year 2010 make cheap
02:24 - and model compass so repeats two times
02:26 - because we did it in two ways
02:29 - well that was fun and that's it for
02:32 - today
02:33 - thank you for watching remember to smash
