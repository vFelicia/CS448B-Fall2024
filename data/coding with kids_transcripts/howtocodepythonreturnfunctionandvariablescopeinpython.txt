00:00 - welcome to including with kids my name
00:03 - is colleen
00:03 - and my name is andrew today we're going
00:05 - to teach you pi farms so today we're
00:07 - going to learn about defining a function
00:09 - so first we're going to do def add
00:11 - numbers x and y so def
00:13 - is basically defined and we're defining
00:16 - a function called
00:17 - add two numbers so as the name tells you
00:20 - the function will add two numbers
00:22 - x and y so you can like type two numbers
00:25 - for
00:25 - x and y then it will return x plus y so
00:28 - basically
00:29 - it'll get the answer next we're going to
00:32 - do add two numbers
00:33 - four and six but this will this will do
00:36 - nothing because
00:37 - there's no print inside the defining
00:40 - function
00:40 - and if you use return which the answer
00:43 - is 10
00:44 - and you capture the answer inside a
00:47 - variable
00:48 - so that's what we're going to do result
00:51 - which is variable equals add two numbers
00:53 - the function
00:54 - five and seven so the answer is twelve
00:57 - so basically it's
00:58 - result equals 12 then i'm going to print
01:01 - result which is 12.
01:02 - so save it and run it
01:06 - well because 5 if you just run the
01:10 - function like add 2 numbers four and six
01:12 - it'll do something but you can't see
01:15 - the function doing it next we're gonna
01:18 - do
01:19 - def create deck so now we're gonna
01:22 - define a function called create deck
01:24 - so it has free lists suits equals hearts
01:27 - spades clubs and diamonds
01:29 - ranks equals two three four five six
01:32 - seven eight nine ten jack queen king and
01:34 - ace
01:34 - then deck equals two square brackets
01:36 - which is an empty list
01:38 - so our checklist will store the cards
01:42 - with the deck and the ranks and suits
01:44 - we're going to use these two lists to
01:46 - make the deck of cards
01:48 - so nixon will use the four statements
01:51 - for suit and suits that means basically
01:53 - for each item in
01:54 - suits for rank and rank so we're going
01:57 - to put a force name inside for steam
01:59 - i'll do deck.append so a pen is a list
02:02 - helper function now add a card
02:04 - or item to your list extra rank of suit
02:08 - so the first time runs this in the suits
02:10 - list it will be checking the item hearts
02:12 - and for the ranks list it will be
02:14 - checking the item two
02:15 - so i'll append the item or
02:19 - card two of hearts and then i'll keep
02:22 - making cards
02:23 - until the last card ace of diamonds
02:26 - then we'll return the deck and we're
02:29 - gonna do
02:30 - my deck equals create deck so we use a
02:32 - variable to capture
02:34 - the create deck function again and so
02:37 - it's basically my deck equals then
02:39 - the card the deck of cards and then
02:42 - print len
02:43 - my deck so then is a function that will
02:45 - tell us
02:46 - the the
02:49 - length of something and here is the item
02:53 - so a deck of cards has 52 cards
02:57 - so basically print 52 so save it and run
03:01 - so that's 52 just as we thought
03:06 - so next we're going to do def sum
03:08 - function so
03:09 - it's silly that the name is called sum
03:11 - function
03:12 - then we'll do a variable called value
03:15 - equals 10
03:15 - and return value want to print value so
03:18 - now let's see what happens
03:20 - so that error name value is not defined
03:24 - so the value inside the sum function
03:27 - while defining it
03:28 - you can only use that variable while
03:31 - you're defining
03:32 - it if you want to use a variable that
03:34 - has the same name out of
03:36 - while defining a function you may state
03:38 - it again
03:39 - so next we're going to do value equals
03:41 - one so now
03:42 - we have a variable called value the same
03:45 - as value equals 10
03:47 - but outside while defining function so
03:50 - now we're still going to print value so
03:53 - now let's see if it prints
03:54 - 10 or 1. so yeah
04:00 - so printed one because we did not call
04:02 - the sum function
04:04 - or and we did not capture the return
04:08 - in the sum function so it just had the
04:11 - value out of the defining function so
04:14 - it's
04:15 - 1. finally we'll do some after print
04:18 - value which is one
04:19 - we're going to call the function sum
04:22 - function
04:23 - then we're going to print value so still
04:25 - print one
04:26 - because the sum function you didn't
04:28 - capture it
04:30 - because it returned the value but you
04:31 - didn't capture it so still one
04:34 - they're gonna do value which is a
04:35 - variable so you can restate
04:38 - variables equals some function so now we
04:41 - capture the
04:42 - sum function so when it returns the
04:45 - value
04:46 - it turns value into 10 so
04:49 - at the last print value will be 10 so
04:52 - it's going to print
04:53 - 1 110 so save
04:58 - just as we guessed and that's it for
05:01 - today
