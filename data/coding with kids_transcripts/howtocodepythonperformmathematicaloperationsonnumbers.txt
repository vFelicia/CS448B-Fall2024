00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and today i'm going to
00:05 - teach you python i'm going to teach you
00:07 - math with numbers so first we already
00:10 - have some code here
00:12 - so first we type first value
00:18 - then second value
00:22 - equals four then we
00:26 - need first value equals five then
00:29 - sum equals first value plus
00:33 - second value then difference
00:36 - is first value minus second value
00:40 - then product will be first value
00:44 - star second value which is
00:47 - multiplication
00:49 - then quotient will need a full
00:52 - slash which is for division
00:57 - then modulus will need a percent
01:01 - then exponent will need
01:04 - a star star so here sum is addition
01:10 - difference is subtraction
01:13 - product is multiplication quotient
01:18 - is division modulus
01:21 - is the remainder then exponent
01:24 - is like five times five
01:28 - because it's five star star four so if
01:31 - it will do five times five times five
01:34 - times five
01:35 - and we already have the code we need
01:36 - over here let's save it
01:38 - with ctrl s then let's run it
01:42 - p y math
01:47 - dot p y let's run it
01:51 - so first we have
01:54 - a sum nine because five
01:57 - plus four equals nine the difference
02:00 - is one because five minus four equals
02:03 - one
02:04 - product is twenty because 5 times
02:08 - 4 equals 20. then
02:11 - quotient is 1
02:14 - dot 25 because 5
02:18 - divided by 4 will be 1.25
02:22 - the modulus will be 1 because
02:26 - 5 divided by 4
02:29 - will be 1.25
02:32 - and then it will do the remainder which
02:35 - is a whole number so it'll be
02:37 - one then exponent will be 625 because
02:42 - 5 times 5 times
02:45 - 5 times 5 equals 625
02:50 - next let's delete these
02:53 - yeah yeah okay this is gonna be hard
02:57 - to believe these are
03:01 - yards
03:03 - then you too yar
03:07 - next we'll need print
03:12 - print free
03:16 - plus four
03:20 - oopsies
03:27 - three plus four then star which is
03:32 - division i mean multiplication
03:36 - then five so
03:39 - here we have three plus four divided by
03:43 - i mean multiplied by five so here
03:49 - three plus four equals seven but we
03:51 - don't have the brackets
03:53 - so it would multiply first because it's
03:55 - the math rule
03:58 - so 4 multiplied by
04:01 - 5 equals 20 and then it will plus
04:04 - 3 because there's addition sign here it
04:07 - will be
04:08 - 23 let's see if it works
04:12 - let's run into the terminal up arrow
04:16 - for what you typed less than the
04:17 - terminal then
04:19 - 23 because 4
04:22 - multiplied by 5 equals 20 and plus 3
04:26 - it will go to 23.
04:30 - then if we want to do audition first
04:33 - we need print
04:37 - then inside the brackets we need another
04:39 - bracket for
04:41 - plus four three
04:45 - plus four
04:48 - then outside will be
04:53 - multiplied by five so first
04:56 - right now where the three plus four will
04:59 - be in
04:59 - the brackets so it will add this first
05:03 - so
05:03 - seven divided multiply by five
05:07 - so let's say and see the difference
05:12 - between jobs so 23 and 35 because
05:16 - 7 times 5 equals
05:22 - 35.
05:24 - you now know the difference
05:27 - then we'll need to do first value
05:31 - equals five then second value
05:34 - equals four then quotient
05:38 - equals first value
05:41 - divided by second value then
05:44 - print quotient print
05:48 - type function it will have the type
05:51 - function here
05:52 - so i will print these what the result
05:55 - will be
05:56 - will actually always be float so it will
06:00 - print
06:00 - a float the type will be a string
06:04 - integer or float
06:05 - let's save it and run it
06:10 - so it's class float because it is
06:14 - a float and because there's a decimal
06:17 - here
06:18 - next we need
06:22 - pi equals
06:27 - 3.14
06:30 - then print
06:35 - type the type function
06:40 - pi then
06:43 - print integer
06:48 - print extra inked
07:01 - the part
07:05 - equals 99.99
07:11 - then print
07:17 - type
07:22 - check up time
07:25 - then print
07:43 - over here will be print type it will
07:46 - see what the class is and the integer so
07:49 - it will make it into a
07:50 - full number a whole number so it won't
07:53 - be a float
07:54 - then we'll print type again with the
07:57 - with a different number
07:59 - so let's do ctrl s and run it
08:04 - it's class float free because of
08:08 - the whole number is actually free then
08:10 - class
08:11 - float because it has a decimal
08:14 - 99 the next one is very
08:17 - like this so we just need a print
08:24 - round
08:32 - [Music]
08:34 - and then print
08:51 - i mean round is actually rounding up the
08:54 - number
08:56 - so let's do ctrl s and say to save it
08:59 - and run it so uh it's
09:03 - class okay let's go back up so we can
09:05 - see
09:06 - the first one class float free
09:09 - and free and there's class
09:12 - float again 99 100.
09:17 - so over here it's 99
09:21 - and it will be 99 and there's 100
09:24 - because over here round up it will be
09:28 - 100
09:29 - but over here is free free because it's
09:32 - round down so it'll be
09:34 - free so next
09:39 - first value
09:48 - is
09:51 - equals round
09:58 - round u uh
10:02 - andy
10:06 - seven point
10:09 - six five four three two
10:12 - one then you print
10:18 - and then i forgot something right here
10:21 - then we need to
10:25 - then print
10:30 - print right here
10:31 - [Music]
10:35 - print
10:38 - first value
10:43 - so here we round down because the rule
10:46 - is
10:48 - five are up in a round up but right now
10:50 - it's
10:51 - two so we need two numbers after the
10:54 - decimal
10:55 - so over here is less
10:58 - than 5 so we
11:02 - round down and we don't need any so
11:05 - it will just print 7.65 let's
11:09 - save it and run it so it's 7.65
11:17 - because we round down so we don't need
11:20 - these
11:20 - numbers anymore so just 27.65
11:25 - next second value
11:32 - equals round
11:38 - nine point
11:47 - comma 3
11:51 - then let's print second value
11:57 - second value so here we need to round
12:01 - up because six is not
12:06 - not less than five so we need to round
12:10 - up so we add
12:11 - one to the six now let's save it
12:14 - and run it
12:17 - so we now we have nine point
12:20 - eight seven seven because we rounded up
12:23 - and add one to the six and then it will
12:27 - be
12:29 - 9.877 it worked and thanks for watching
