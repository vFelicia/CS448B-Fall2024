00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and today i'm gonna be
00:05 - showing
00:06 - my project called rainbow drawing
00:10 - so first we have our first stop one
00:14 - and well one green flat is clipped
00:18 - which means you start a project for
00:21 - it will point in direction pick random
00:23 - so it will prick
00:25 - made between these two numbers negative
00:28 - 180
00:30 - to 180 so it will point in that
00:32 - direction
00:34 - then forever it will move 10 steps
00:37 - then if on edge on the edge of the
00:40 - screen
00:41 - it will bounce if we don't have this
00:44 - then it will do like this
00:49 - screen and
00:52 - it won't return to you except if you
00:55 - have the code to return back to
00:57 - somewhere near the screen
00:59 - like this code um
01:03 - go to that code
01:06 - uh so we need this so dot 2 and dot
01:10 - 3 has the same kind of code
01:13 - because we need three dots then we have
01:16 - a change dot which is
01:17 - completely not the same
01:22 - so at first erase all because when we
01:24 - press this it will drop
01:26 - so when we erase we will erase it okay
01:29 - let me erase it again
01:30 - we just need to get every song okay now
01:33 - it's erased
01:34 - then set pin size to a pin
01:37 - we will let it dry on the stars
01:41 - backdrop looks so beautiful
01:45 - then forever pen up then
01:48 - go to dot one that one is the red one
01:51 - then pen down so we can start
01:55 - drawing go 2.2 and dot 3.2 is orange and
01:58 - dot free
02:00 - is yellow i'm making the colors of the
02:03 - rainbow
02:03 - red orange yellow okay i don't have
02:06 - green blue and purple
02:08 - but you violet then got go 2.2 and free
02:14 - and change pen color by 10 so make a
02:17 - beautiful
02:19 - but if i change color by one
02:23 - let's see what happens
02:27 - whoa this looks so beautiful
02:33 - okay it looks so beautiful so
02:36 - we're gonna add one more dot oh god
02:39 - first
02:40 - i'm gonna draw the dots so uh
02:44 - it will be green because it's part of a
02:47 - rainbow i need to be yup green
02:51 - and then i gotta paint it
02:56 - 30. i think this is big enough
03:01 - i think that's how the usual ones are
03:03 - yep 30
03:04 - then we need to code to make it
03:08 - faster we just need to get this
03:11 - drag on the code you need then it's
03:14 - like blue then when it is green
03:18 - that means they received a code and look
03:20 - it has the same code as that 3.2 and
03:23 - that one
03:23 - but right now its name is sprite one
03:26 - then let's do it to
03:27 - dot dot
03:32 - four but don't think this isn't
03:36 - all the thing you need you still need to
03:38 - go to that four
03:39 - here or else that four is just like a
03:44 - this bouncing bouncing it's doing
03:46 - nothing it's doing nothing
03:50 - okay so that's why we need
03:54 - a dot for that
03:58 - go to
04:00 - [Music]
