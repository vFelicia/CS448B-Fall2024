00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - edible edibit is a platform where there
00:07 - are lots and lots of coding problems and
00:10 - then you have to solve them with
00:12 - um different coding languages So today
00:14 - we're going to do three problems using
00:17 - python so our first problem is called
00:21 - equality of three values create our
00:24 - instructions are to create a function
00:26 - that takes free integer arguments a b
00:29 - and c and Returns the amount of integers
00:31 - which are of equal value
00:33 - here are some examples so it will give
00:36 - us three numbers so in this example it's
00:39 - three four and three so we need to
00:42 - um you get a function to return how many
00:45 - numbers are equal so here there are two
00:47 - threes so we will return two and then
00:50 - here all of them are one so that means
00:53 - they're all equal so we return three and
00:55 - then here there's three four and one
00:57 - none of them are equal so return zero
00:59 - your function must return zero two or
01:01 - three let's see a code
01:04 - so we have a function called equal and
01:06 - we have three variables a b and c so
01:09 - first we're going to make a variable
01:10 - called num and it's going to start with
01:13 - as zero then if a is equal to B and B is
01:19 - equal to C so if they're all equal we're
01:22 - going to get the num and restate it to
01:24 - three because all the free numbers are
01:27 - equal yeah so we use two uh equal marked
01:30 - signs to actually mean equal not to
01:33 - State like number is zero okay then
01:37 - we're going to do else if a is b or a is
01:42 - C or B is C so if they're each other
01:46 - then L num equals two
01:49 - there are two numbers that are equal and
01:51 - then if none of these not if if an L if
01:55 - don't work we're going to go to else and
01:58 - we're just going to do num equals zero
01:59 - because none of them are equal yeah and
02:02 - then we're going to return the num
02:04 - variable so now let's check and see the
02:07 - test the test will go three random
02:09 - numbers here and then oh
02:13 - here there's the number that we need to
02:16 - return using the num variable and then
02:19 - here are what here are what the numbers
02:23 - are so like two three and four all
02:25 - values are different so when you turn
02:27 - zero that's the console so all this past
02:29 - test pass test our pass yay next one our
02:34 - next problem is called temperature
02:35 - conversion write a program that takes a
02:38 - temperature input in Celsius which is
02:40 - variable and converts it to Fahrenheit
02:43 - and Kelvin so verified and Kelvin are
02:45 - both
02:47 - um units of temperature return the
02:50 - converted temperature and values in a
02:52 - list the formulas that calculate the
02:54 - temperature in Fahrenheit from Celsius
02:55 - is this is the formula from Celsius to
02:58 - Fahrenheit and this is the formula for
03:00 - Celsius to Kelvin so here are examples
03:03 - so it'll just give us um the Celsius
03:07 - and then when you return the fahrenheit
03:09 - and the Kelvin so return invalid if K is
03:13 - less than zero so K is Kelvin and our
03:15 - term calculated temperatures up to two
03:17 - decimal pieces we don't want the numbers
03:19 - to get too long so we have a function
03:23 - called temp conversion and we have one
03:25 - variable called Celsius
03:28 - so first we're going to make a variable
03:30 - which is the formula for turning Celsius
03:32 - into Fahrenheit so it's called f equals
03:35 - round so the round function will limit
03:38 - will make your number whatever number
03:40 - into how many digits you want so this is
03:43 - formula and then we added two for the
03:46 - round function to limit it to two
03:49 - decimal places and then we're going to
03:51 - do the same frame of Kelvin the variable
03:54 - is called K and here's the formula and
03:57 - we're also going to eliminate to two
03:59 - decimal places then we're going to do if
04:03 - K is less than zero we're going to
04:05 - return invalid
04:07 - and then else if K is above zero then
04:12 - we're okay and we're going to return the
04:15 - fahrenheit and Kelvin in a list so we're
04:17 - going to do
04:18 - um square brackets and F and K so let's
04:22 - see the tests so here it'll give us the
04:24 - Celsius 0 148.2 and then we're going to
04:28 - return the fahrenheit and Kelvin so here
04:31 - that you can see they're all limited to
04:33 - the two
04:34 - um two decimal places and here it's
04:36 - invalid wow is it really that cold okay
04:40 - so all tests are passed on to the final
04:43 - problem find the perimeter of a
04:46 - rectangle so create a function that
04:48 - takes length and width which are both
04:51 - variables and finds the perimeter of
04:53 - rectangle so here examples it will give
04:57 - us six and seven and then when you
05:00 - calculate and it's going to be 20 the
05:02 - perimeter is 26. okay so when you return
05:05 - the result let's see the code so we have
05:07 - a variable called find parameter and two
05:10 - variables which is length and width so
05:14 - first we're going to do half so half of
05:16 - the rectangle we're going to do length
05:18 - plus width
05:20 - and then we're going to do perimeter
05:22 - which is another variable and use the
05:23 - half variable and Then star two so star
05:26 - in Python is
05:29 - um multiplication so to
05:32 - um calculate perimeter you need to do
05:34 - length times two or width times two I
05:36 - just do length plus which you can do
05:37 - either way and then uh multiply it by
05:41 - two and then we're going to return
05:43 - perimeter it's very simple and we're
05:46 - gonna see the test so here it goes two
05:49 - so twenty and ten so 20 plus 10 is 30 30
05:53 - times 2 is 60. so the answer the
05:56 - parameter will be 60. okay so all tests
05:58 - are passed
05:59 - okay so here is another two and nine two
06:03 - plus nine equals eleven and eleven plus
06:06 - eleven is 22. okay well that was fun and
06:11 - that's it for today thank you for
