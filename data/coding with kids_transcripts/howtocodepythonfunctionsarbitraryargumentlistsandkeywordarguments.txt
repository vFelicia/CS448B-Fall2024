00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:03 - is andrew today we're going to
00:05 - teach you python today we're going to
00:07 - learn about arguments
00:09 - so first we're going to do deaf print
00:11 - arts then a star
00:13 - so star args so arc is basically
00:16 - arguments
00:17 - and whatever you type here you can type
00:20 - strings floats or any type and the star
00:24 - makes it so you can type any number of
00:28 - arguments inside and then do a for
00:31 - statement inside while defining the
00:33 - print
00:33 - r function so for argon r so
00:36 - as we said the star mixes so you can
00:39 - type any number of arguments
00:41 - so for each argument and we'll print f
00:43 - string r
00:44 - equals and then whatever you typed in
00:47 - then print aux
00:48 - a so a is our first and only
00:51 - argument so do for rs and
00:54 - arcs it will print string arc equals a
00:58 - then it'll do that same thing for a and
01:00 - b
01:01 - and a b and c so let's save it
01:04 - and run it so see
01:09 - it did it
01:18 - a because the second time marie called
01:20 - the function we also added another a
01:23 - so that r equals b r equals a
01:26 - and finally r equals b and r equals c
01:31 - that worked so next we will replace the
01:34 - for statement
01:35 - with print r so for the first time
01:37 - recall the function
01:39 - you'll print a and it'll print the type
01:42 - of odds
01:43 - so now let's save it and run it so they
01:45 - had a
01:46 - class tuple a b class double and a b
01:49 - c class tuple so all these are class
01:52 - tuples
01:53 - and tuples are just like lists but you
01:55 - can't modify them and you can't
01:57 - use list helper functions so now we're
02:01 - going to
02:02 - do rx 0 equals z
02:05 - in the def print ours
02:08 - to see if it can do lists
02:12 - so it has a error
02:15 - so it's a tuple not a list
02:19 - so let's gonna do different keyword args
02:23 - then star star quarks those quarks is
02:26 - named
02:26 - arguments then we're going to do third
02:28 - equals quarks dot get
02:30 - so get is a function that will unlock
02:33 - something with the key
02:34 - third then none so none is a default
02:37 - value
02:38 - then if third is not none it'll print
02:41 - third arc equals third
02:44 - then we're going to do print keyword
02:46 - args first
02:48 - equals a so the first time
02:51 - we call the function it will do nothing
02:52 - because there's no
02:54 - third key then the second time we're
02:56 - going to print keyword args
02:58 - first equals b and second equals c the
03:00 - second time we call it it also do
03:02 - nothing
03:03 - because it all still has no third key
03:07 - the last time we'll do print keyword
03:10 - arcs first equals d
03:11 - second equal e and third equals f so now
03:15 - we have a third key so it'll do
03:17 - third equal third r equals f so save it
03:21 - and run it so deferred r
03:24 - equals f that worked well that was
03:28 - fun and that's it for today thank you
