00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and mine was andrew today
00:06 - we are in scratch and in andrew's
00:08 - account starring snatch cat
00:10 - so today i'm going to show you my
00:12 - project
00:13 - dino dance so as you see the name is
00:16 - dino dance
00:17 - and you see dinosaurs so you know
00:19 - dinosaurs are going to
00:21 - dance so this is a dinosaur i got from
00:25 - the scratch
00:26 - library and yeah let's show you what the
00:29 - project does
00:37 - yay okay now let's show you the code
00:41 - so it was made the dinosaur 4 is the
00:44 - blue one
00:45 - so i changed it blue and it was original
00:48 - one of these
00:49 - green dinosaurs and so the code is when
00:53 - right arrow
00:53 - pressed key pressed point direction 90
00:56 - and moved 10 steps so
00:58 - you'll go right and one left arrow key
01:00 - press
01:01 - point direction negative 90 and move 10
01:03 - steps
01:04 - so you go left so when green 5 click
01:07 - that means when you
01:08 - run it then your set rotations start
01:10 - left right so
01:12 - left and right automatically then if
01:15 - forever
01:15 - move ten steps then if on
01:19 - edge bounce so bounce if it
01:22 - touches the edge then also when
01:26 - green flag clicked forever switch
01:28 - costumes to dinosaur
01:30 - for c which is
01:32 - [Music]
01:34 - this one the original costume
01:37 - and then what wait 0.5 seconds and then
01:40 - switch costume the dinosaur
01:42 - for d so it's this one this is kind of
01:45 - like a dancing
01:46 - costume and wait 0.5 seconds and like
01:50 - switch costume again
01:51 - so that's how so you can control the
01:53 - blue dinosaur
01:55 - then the dinosaur three does dinosaur
01:58 - two dinosaur free and dicey now
02:00 - five all have the same code so like i
02:04 - duplicated the sprite and
02:07 - i tried the code to them and added the
02:10 - same code to it
02:11 - so let's see the code of dinosaur two so
02:14 - when green flag clicked
02:16 - set rotation style left right so it's
02:18 - just like the blue dinosaur and then
02:20 - move ten steps
02:21 - of an edge bounce so that's the same as
02:23 - the blue dinosaur
02:24 - so it'll like go left and right and i'll
02:27 - also
02:28 - keep changing costumes over here just
02:30 - like the blue dinosaur
02:31 - but you can't control so like it just
02:34 - goes randomly

02:38 - diamond so that's the same for dinosaur
02:40 - two
02:40 - there's three and dinosaur five
