00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're
00:05 - going to use chat GPT to create a simple
00:08 - game in Python So today we're going to
00:10 - show you how to create a Hangman game in
00:12 - Python using track gbt so first I asked
00:15 - us to give me some simple games it says
00:18 - certainly here are a few examples of
00:20 - simple games you can play Tic-Tac-Toe we
00:22 - already did did that in Python Hang Man
00:25 - which we're gonna do today 20 Questions
00:27 - Pictionary charades which we can't do in
00:29 - python or maybe we can but we need lots
00:32 - of people to play it and Simon Says and
00:35 - I spot so these are just a few examples
00:38 - of simple games you can enjoy you can
00:40 - modify the rules or add variations to
00:42 - suit your preferences have fun play so
00:44 - Nana said to Chachi make a simple
00:47 - Hangman game with Clues and two players
00:50 - with python and explain it to me like
00:52 - I'm a python beginner it says sure I can
00:55 - help you create a simple hangman gamer
00:57 - python he's a step-by-step explanation
00:59 - of how to do it so step one to set up
01:02 - the game first you need to import the
01:03 - random module to generate a random word
01:06 - for the game here input
01:08 - then you can start by defining a list of
01:10 - words that will be used as the word bank
01:12 - for the game so then there's a list
01:13 - which we can put in the words that we
01:17 - can guess
01:18 - here for example as an example it's
01:21 - apple banana character and eggplant and
01:23 - fig so you can change those words to
01:26 - whatever you want select step two or
01:29 - select a random word next you need to
01:31 - choose a random word from the word Bank
01:33 - you can use the rand.choice function to
01:35 - do this so here we have variable storing
01:38 - the one of these words from the list as
01:41 - the word you you are supposed to guess
01:43 - then step three we're gonna initialize
01:46 - the variables you need some variables to
01:48 - keep track of the game's profits
01:50 - initialize variables like guesses math
01:52 - guess Max guesses Clues and guess
01:55 - letters so there's guesses which is zero
01:58 - it will increase over time the maximum
02:01 - guesses here it's six you can also
02:03 - modify that and then we have a variable
02:05 - called clue equals and there's this
02:08 - times the length of the word to create
02:11 - to tell you um how many letters the word
02:14 - has and then there's a list that will
02:16 - contain your guest letters step four is
02:19 - create a loop for gameplay so first I'm
02:21 - going to do a while loop while guesses
02:23 - is less than Max's maximum guesses and
02:26 - clue is not word we're going to display
02:28 - the current clue in guest letters so I'm
02:31 - going to print clue and we're going to
02:33 - give the amount of letters in the word
02:35 - and then we're going to print guest
02:36 - letters here which is also a list and
02:40 - then we're going to prompt the player
02:41 - for a guess so we're going to create a
02:43 - variable with our answer equals input
02:45 - guess letter and then we'll change the
02:47 - letter to lower
02:49 - and then we're it's going to store our
02:51 - answer here and then we're going to
02:53 - check if the guess is valid if it's in
02:55 - the word so if length of guess is not
02:57 - one or it's not guest dot is Alpha so
03:00 - it's Alpha checks if the input or
03:04 - whatever it's checking is only one
03:05 - letter so if length if the length is not
03:10 - uh one letter it's going to print
03:12 - invalid guess please enter a single
03:15 - letter and we're going to continue then
03:17 - we're going to check if the letter has
03:18 - already been guessed if guess in guest
03:21 - letters then it will print you already
03:23 - guessed that letter and then you can
03:24 - guess again
03:25 - next we're going to add the guess to the
03:28 - list of guest letters if we pass both
03:30 - these if Loops we're going to do guess
03:32 - dot letters guess letters the append
03:35 - guess we're gonna add it to the list and
03:38 - then we're gonna check the guess is in
03:40 - the word so if guess is in the word
03:42 - we're gonna do we're gonna update our
03:45 - clue or our word that is Mystery
03:49 - unknown and then we're going to print
03:51 - correct guess because it's in the word
03:53 - if it's not in the word we're going to
03:55 - add one to the guesses variable I'm
03:58 - going to print incorrect guess then
04:00 - we're going to print
04:01 - then step five in the game so if guesses
04:05 - equals equals Max guesses remember it's
04:07 - about two so you're not a science so if
04:10 - you're you reach the max gases it'll
04:12 - print you lost the word was and then
04:14 - I'll show you the word if you didn't
04:16 - then it'll print congratulations you've
04:18 - guessed the word and it'll also show the
04:20 - word even if you did it against it
04:23 - that's it you now have a basic Hangman
04:25 - game feel free to add more features or
04:27 - customize it further as you become more
04:29 - comfortable with python remember to
04:31 - indent the code properly to maintain the
04:33 - structure and functionality happy code
04:36 - so now we're in Visual Studio codes and
04:38 - we put all the code here and we change
04:41 - the word bank to games YouTube coding
04:43 - Andrew Kalia and Python and we're going
04:46 - to change the max guesses to 10 so we
04:48 - have space for wrong letters
04:50 - okay so now we're gonna do
04:53 - you want to go first sure okay okay I'm
04:56 - gonna put an a because it's very
04:58 - very there is six letters there's no a
05:01 - this six letters
05:04 - um
05:05 - let's see there's no a so let's try the
05:07 - bar there is a y that's the second
05:10 - letter
05:11 - let me think of the huh
05:16 - it's python yeah
05:21 - okay you guessed the word python okay my
05:24 - turn
05:25 - let's see there is also six letters
05:28 - let's choose a there's a it's probably
05:31 - my name this is my name
05:34 - okay
05:35 - one more time for us each okay I'm good
05:39 - it's six again right I think so yeah it
05:43 - sucks there's no kick
05:45 - uh
05:48 - there's a g at the end okay it hasn't
05:50 - what could it be
05:52 - uh
05:56 - let me try
05:58 - it there is no e
06:01 - there is no a either you have four
06:03 - guesses
06:07 - what ends with a G
06:11 - I have no idea I'm just gonna guess
06:13 - random letters now
06:14 - there's an o in the second letter
06:17 - oh
06:20 - it's coding oh I'm running out of
06:23 - guesses
06:27 - you made it okay my turn last one see
06:32 - seven letters
06:33 - there's only one thing that has seven
06:35 - letters there's no way
06:39 - let's see there's no C either
06:45 - there is a it's probably YouTube yeah
06:47 - it's the only one in our bank that had
06:50 - seven letters so
06:53 - okay congratulations you guessed the
06:56 - word YouTube well that was fun and
06:59 - that's it for today thank you for
07:01 - watching Remember to smash that button
07:04 - and subscribe bye bye
