01:11 - minecrafty background where i
01:14 - uploaded these buttons

01:26 - down arrow
01:27 - but you don't use the left and right
01:29 - arrow and there is the player
01:32 - it's supposed to be a jet pack here
01:34 - there is a steve with an
01:36 - ultra on and there's like a blast of
01:38 - lime
01:39 - that means you're flying but if the
01:42 - player died doesn't have a blast on
01:44 - blind
01:44 - so you will know the difference and
01:46 - there's the standing and
01:48 - ultra these two you won't see and these
