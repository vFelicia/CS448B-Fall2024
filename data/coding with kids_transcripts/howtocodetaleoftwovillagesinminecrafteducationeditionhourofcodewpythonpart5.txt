00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew
00:04 - today we're on minecraft education
00:06 - edition so we're in the
00:08 - two villages hour of code so
00:11 - the simple tale was that there were two
00:13 - villages
00:14 - the villager village and the elder
00:16 - village and
00:18 - they were friends but then they knew how
00:21 - they learned how to live on their own
00:23 - and now we're going to unite them
00:24 - together so
00:26 - we're today we're going to go to the
00:27 - regular village and we're going to
00:30 - go to this fisherman
00:33 - so now we're going to talk to him so the
00:35 - fisher says hi friend
00:36 - fishing is something we've never been
00:38 - good at the elders from the next town
00:40 - over are offering to help us learn how
00:42 - but they say we need a doctor
00:46 - an official says can you help us build
00:49 - the dock at the edge of the shore
00:50 - or just meet the outline see if he can
00:52 - build a six bucks long four box walk
00:55 - restart activity okay
00:58 - so our agent needs to follow these green
01:02 - dots
01:03 - and to build the outline
01:06 - of the dock and then our code will be
01:09 - complete
01:10 - so we're gonna press two
01:12 - [Music]
01:13 - so we can do agent dot give planks
01:16 - to give so the eddy can give himself
01:20 - blocks and then we're gonna do if we can
01:22 - move the agent
01:23 - and place the box so let me go here for
01:26 - iron range six so i'll repeat this six
01:28 - times
01:29 - for the first side of the dot so i'm
01:32 - going to do
01:32 - six i'm gonna do agent dot give planks
01:35 - to one so i'll give myself
01:37 - planks then i'll do asian.place
01:44 - down and then
01:50 - between the gif and the placement the
01:52 - agent dot
01:53 - move forward
01:57 - so now
01:59 - [Music]
02:01 - let's go so now the agent has made
02:05 - one side of be done successfully
02:09 - it looks like like a player holding the
02:12 - wood blank so now
02:16 - we're going to do agent dot
02:20 - move right
02:23 - to turn
02:25 - [Music]
02:28 - hello agent
02:30 - [Music]
02:31 - then we're gonna
02:35 - let's start doing this
02:38 - again but now we're going to do it
02:41 - three times so i'm going to change these
02:45 - six
02:46 - to a free then we're gonna do asian.gif
02:49 - planks
02:50 - still we're going to do agent.move
02:53 - right so now i'm going to
02:57 - do this
03:00 - after the agent
03:04 - puts the block down
03:10 - so now we have built again another side
03:13 - so now we have one
03:15 - more side left to complete the dock
03:19 - so i want to move left one time because
03:22 - it's trying to do agent
03:26 - dot mode left
03:30 - get into place first okay
03:32 - [Music]
03:34 - two three four five so now we only you
03:37 - do it
03:37 - five times
03:41 - oops and do the
03:44 - four i in range
03:48 - and do it five times
03:51 - and do
03:55 - asian dot move
03:56 - [Music]
03:58 - backward agent dot move
04:02 - backward and then we're gonna do
04:06 - dot give
04:09 - planks to
04:13 - one then
04:16 - a gentle place
04:22 - place one
04:25 - down one
04:29 - down
04:31 - [Music]
04:41 - so now it's completing the last side so
04:43 - now there are
04:44 - townsfolk so the caretaker says equity
04:47 - is not about giving everyone the same
04:49 - thing it is about making sure everyone
04:51 - has what they need to be successful
04:54 - before you build dock the villagers
04:55 - didn't have what they needed to learn to
04:57 - fish they don't want them to do this
05:00 - then the caretaker said fishing together
05:03 - with your dog and some lessons from the
05:05 - elders the villagers learn to fish
05:06 - oneself
05:07 - don't forget to check on your tree but
05:09 - it's good so
05:10 - now we have completed the second last
05:14 - activity
05:17 - and now they are the villagers and
05:19 - villagers are
05:21 - fishing happily so now we're gonna use
05:24 - this to teleport t-shirt
05:27 - it's nice
05:30 - i think it can fit about
