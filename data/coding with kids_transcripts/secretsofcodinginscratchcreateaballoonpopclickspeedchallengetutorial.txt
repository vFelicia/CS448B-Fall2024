01:44 - adding like because it's called top
01:47 - wait one second change time by one show
01:50 - variable time
01:51 - so oh every it's like a timer
01:56 - and then if clicks is
01:59 - bigger than is greater than 20 then
02:03 - switch costume to a costume 2
02:05 - so if it's less than 20 it will not pop
02:09 - this is costume two it's the popped
02:11 - balloon
02:13 - the balloon popped and then
02:16 - it will brought a kiss and next is the
02:20 - instructions
02:22 - so when you press the instructions
02:24 - button you'll say click on the balloon
02:25 - as many times and 10 seconds
02:28 - for three seconds so it tells you the
02:31 - simple instructions
02:32 - yeah then when green flag click go to
02:36 - the position it is right now then show
02:39 - then
02:40 - whenever you save play time it will hide
02:42 - because you're playing so you don't need
02:43 - the menu
02:44 - yeah then the play button
02:47 - when this sprite click broadcast play
02:50 - time
02:51 - hide you need a broadcast deploy time
02:54 - because when you
02:55 - click it it's time to play then when
02:57 - green flag clicked
02:59 - show how good is the pop-up meter
03:03 - when green flag clicked high and go to
03:05 - the position which is right here and
03:07 - when i receive and show
03:09 - because you don't want to see the pop-up
03:11 - meter when you're playing
03:12 - and there's the slider when grapefruit
03:16 - click
03:16 - hide and go to over here
03:20 - yeah about there here and then when i
03:23 - receive
03:24 - end is where i will tell the instruction
03:27 - where to go if clicks
03:31 - is greater than 70 and less than
03:34 - 100 or clicks equal to 100
03:38 - so if i don't have the equal to 100 if
03:40 - you do 100 clicks
03:42 - you'll like the it'll do your popping
03:45 - here nowhere
03:46 - yeah just stay here like i have nothing
03:48 - to do
03:49 - then glide to one second to the
03:53 - green space on the how good which i
03:56 - called the pop-up meter
03:58 - on the green space because you're so
04:00 - good like 70
04:02 - to 100. so using the glide to go
04:06 - like pop the blue and show your score
04:08 - yeah
04:09 - but if clicks is
04:13 - greater than 40 and less than 70 or
04:16 - clicks
04:16 - equals to 70 it will go to the yellow
04:19 - spot
04:20 - so it's the same for the other ones
04:24 - but it's just the 20 to 44
04:38 - and when i start as a clone so we're now
04:40 - coding the clone
