00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew here we're scratching my account
00:06 - kidnap code 123. in this project i
00:09 - upgraded called minecraft crash game cat
00:12 - via stub version 1.1
00:14 - so
00:16 - you see that i actually use the
00:18 - background
00:20 - to unfold
00:22 - sleeping very cute
00:24 - and now i'm going to show you what i
00:26 - changed so before you
00:28 - grilled salmon and for the raw salmon if
00:31 - the wolf touches it so if touching wolf
00:35 - it will place sound wolf sound and it
00:38 - will change scores bones will chewed by
00:41 - one so the wolf will get a point if it
00:44 - gets the fish
00:47 - in the raw salmon
00:49 - if touching the wolf is the same code as
00:52 - the um
00:53 - the grilled salmon except it's
00:57 - in another spring
00:59 - so
01:00 - in the um last version the wolf only got
01:03 - pointed if um it got the bone yeah
01:07 - and minus point seven touch the creeper
01:09 - so for the
01:11 - cat's update upgrade um
01:15 - if
01:15 - it is touching the creeper it will
01:18 - play the bite sound even though if a cat
01:21 - doesn't
01:22 - eat a creeper it scares it away
01:26 - um it will change scores slash 50 cat
01:28 - eight
01:30 - it will just be score that's why i just
01:32 - add the score slash fish to cat eight
01:35 - and i change the background to a cute
01:39 - little fox sleeping
01:41 - the other
01:42 - background was just like
01:44 - a normal minecraft background i thought
01:46 - that would be a little bit too lame so i
01:49 - just changed it into a cute box even
01:51 - though if a fox does nothing in this
01:53 - game
01:55 - yeah
01:56 - so let's play
01:58 - to use the last keys for um
02:02 - the
02:03 - box i mean the wall
02:05 - and
02:06 - um
02:21 - i guess the wolf has an advantage
02:23 - because it can get both um fish
02:27 - both fish
02:29 - so that's a advantage
02:32 - which this
02:33 - cat
02:39 - [Music]
02:47 - improved in the first round
02:54 - it's because it's because the fish
02:56 - always touches the
02:58 - my enemy fish with the bra
03:02 - so you should just get the creeper
03:05 - yeah but if
03:06 - but if the um solomon touches the um
03:10 - red line then it's going to minus points
03:12 - 15 to 5 again except the timer is 31
03:15 - seconds which the other one was 41
03:17 - seconds i guess yeah we took more time
03:19 - in this one okay well that was fun and
03:24 - that's it for today thank you for
03:26 - watching remember to smash the like and
03:28 - subscribe bye bye
