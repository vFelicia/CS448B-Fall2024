00:01 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia mine is Andrew today we're in
00:06 - Minecraft education Edition and in this
00:08 - hour code called Escape Austin so in the
00:11 - last video we finished
00:13 - um and we finished the kitchen so we
00:15 - helped these four mobs and now we're
00:17 - gonna go through this
00:20 - door
00:21 - so we cannot go back after we go through
00:26 - it oh where are we the shopping Rock
00:30 - it's chess cool so let's go down
00:34 - okay so this is particle articles right
00:37 - click part
00:38 - oh what's this
00:42 - polish Play It's like a puzzle I think
00:45 - we need to solve it yeah okay let's see
00:49 - it looks like these pieces are part of
00:51 - an uncomplete picture try rewarding them
00:54 - to see what it's supposed to be use the
00:56 - push pieces function to trigger the
00:58 - Pistons to move the pieces in that
01:01 - direction so so it's like this kind of
01:04 - puzzle where there's a picture but all
01:06 - the pieces are every are mixed up so you
01:09 - need to try to get them back in the
01:11 - right place so this is a code example
01:13 - it's not the right answer so let's see
01:16 - what it is
01:17 - oh
01:18 - that doesn't solve it okay
01:22 - so push the box to reorder them so all
01:26 - the different pieces make a complete
01:28 - picture
01:28 - so let's see first
01:32 - um we'll do push left and then push
01:35 - right and then up let's see if no push
01:39 - left up and then right okay so push left
01:44 - and then push pieces
01:48 - push pieces
01:54 - up and then
01:57 - push pieces
02:03 - right
02:05 - okay let's see if that works
02:08 - right oh it works it's a cane oh okay
02:12 - and then there's right click the king it
02:15 - has a creeper face it's a real chess
02:18 - piece now where I click it
02:31 - the button
02:34 - oh what's this oh the queen is up there
02:37 - okay so it looks like we have to make
02:40 - stairs
02:43 - there seems to be something on top
02:45 - something at the top of the bookcase see
02:48 - if you can create a way to get up there
02:50 - use move cursor to position the cursor
02:53 - and place block to place a block in your
02:55 - selected position so we need to make
02:59 - stairs for us to go up the bookcase and
03:01 - get the queen okay so let's go code
03:06 - Okay so
03:09 - this is an example we'll see what it
03:11 - does we have gold blocks
03:14 - looks rich
03:16 - you can't we can't go up there okay so
03:18 - we have to create like a staircase all
03:22 - the way up reset it
03:27 - good noise so
03:30 - um this is like easier way to use loop
03:33 - it's just like the same command as the
03:35 - this first one but it's um in a shorter
03:39 - code
03:39 - okay so this will also place the first
03:43 - four one the example gold box I'll take
03:46 - long longer code to do it yes if we
03:50 - don't use the loop okay so now let's
03:52 - reset it again so we need to so there's
03:57 - like these marks for us to know where to
04:00 - put it
04:01 - so free yellow we need yellow and yellow
04:06 - okay so first write that up we're gonna
04:10 - Place block
04:12 - free time so we're I'm just gonna
04:15 - let's try free first
04:18 - one two three okay and then oopsies now
04:22 - we need to move up which is orange
04:26 - okay so we'll end up here move up orange
04:29 - and then move yellow Place Block in the
04:32 - move yellow Place block okay and then
04:35 - we're gonna go move
04:37 - cursor
04:40 - orange to go up bespoke cursory oopsies
04:43 - right
04:45 - oh yeah
04:48 - oh it's supposed to be
04:51 - here okay and then we're we're ready up
04:55 - we're gonna do four eye in range which
04:59 - is basically a loop two times
05:02 - well you don't need a place
05:10 - block
05:12 - and then we're gonna
05:15 - move cursor yellow
05:23 - okay let's see
05:26 - okay one two three okay up one two
05:32 - okay so if you want to be faster you're
05:36 - gonna see if you can make this parkour
05:38 - okay
05:40 - Andrew's better at Parker than me
05:43 - we made it right click the queen it's
05:46 - not a zombie face it's crying it's like
05:49 - a witch I think it's a ghast
05:52 - okay let's see Queen takes this
05:55 - walk now there's a queen and king oh
05:59 - what's this
06:00 - pieces fifth fourth third second first
06:03 - January February March April May and the
06:06 - five by five chess board yeah it's
06:09 - amazing so it's like the coordinates of
06:12 - the where it is
06:14 - so the King's birthday is April April
06:18 - 1st so we have to move it to eat another
06:20 - cake oh this is the queen Queen's
06:23 - birthday it's May E4 so I think we need
06:26 - to move them to their birthday okay
06:29 - school code
06:31 - all right you free the king and queen
06:34 - but the door still isn't opening they
06:36 - must be in the wrong positions move them
06:38 - into the correct position so you can
06:39 - finally escape this place so use the
06:42 - move chest piece function to move the
06:44 - king and queen into correct positions so
06:47 - there's king and queen
06:50 - okay so let's see what this will do
06:53 - move to okay
06:57 - it's in 10 seconds
07:01 - but it's not the right birthday she need
07:04 - to look at the signs and see where their
07:06 - birthday is so King's birthday is April
07:08 - 1st so it should be all the way here
07:12 - here right here and then the queen is
07:17 - May 4th so it has to be uh here and then
07:22 - one two three like over here okay
07:27 - let's go to code
07:28 - so search your room to find where you
07:31 - move each test piece and then right
07:34 - then write code to position them to to
07:37 - the correct spots on the black and white
07:39 - checkered floor make sure the chest
07:41 - pieces don't button to each other so we
07:43 - can also use the repeat block yeah so
07:46 - we're just gonna do this on our own so
07:49 - first let's just do our King first April
07:52 - 1st so we move orange one two three four
07:57 - times and blue one time so orange four
08:01 - times and blue one time so for I in
08:05 - range four times
08:09 - we're gonna move
08:12 - test piece
08:16 - King
08:19 - Orange
08:21 - four times and then we're gonna move
08:24 - move
08:26 - tests
08:29 - oh no this is not in the um
08:32 - the loop okay
08:37 - or uh blue one time so we're gonna move

10:24 - managed to make your way through the
10:26 - Mansion Bravo we knew you could do it in
10:28 - fact we were counting on it close that's
10:30 - suspicious oh it's the time agents you
10:35 - see this place is more than just a
10:37 - mansion it's a
10:38 - inter-dimensional prison one that we

11:12 - won't fall for your tricks again the
11:14 - point always open you can't stop us
11:17 - you're out of time and so worry so long
11:20 - jumps portal
11:24 - that portal leads to the time orb
11:27 - they'll be able to use it to escape the
11:29 - only way to stop the time or is by using
11:32 - the Chrono cannons it won't take long
11:35 - for them to charge up the orb so we must
11:39 - quickly activate the defenses and stop
11:42 - them once and for all now go
11:44 - oh
11:48 - my God that's the time yes the time
11:52 - where we can use it to escape what part
