00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew
00:04 - today we're on minecraft education
00:05 - edition and we're gonna do one of those
00:08 - tutorials so we're in microsoft makeup
00:18 - [Music]
00:29 - in which is to cause sound to mix giant
00:32 - lips into the sky
00:34 - and um i can use to code and set
00:37 - item type to try it so let's
00:40 - get these
00:42 - [Music]
00:48 - [Music]
00:56 - we want multiple fish to spawn for each
00:59 - trident news so
01:00 - insert a repeat loop into the item music
01:04 - and set the repeat number to six
01:07 - so we repeat six times
01:13 - now we need to spawn them all
01:17 - [Music]
01:18 - some chicken this one
01:22 - yes so it's gonna spawn
01:28 - and now we need to pick random position
01:33 - pick random from
01:37 - negative three thirty
01:41 - negative three
01:44 - [Music]
01:46 - from three thirty three so the sixth
01:50 - almost one
01:52 - six different spots
01:56 - [Music]
01:59 - and now i'll just made it so
02:03 - these salmon fall from extremely high
02:06 - we should create a pound to catch them
02:09 - so they
02:10 - don't get injured when they land add a
02:12 - new on item
02:14 - used to your code and set the item to
02:16 - kelp
02:18 - so kelp
02:21 - okay it's like a drive seat
02:27 - use a drive truck
02:29 - [Music]
02:32 - and put a fill into the on item used
02:35 - that's set for the fallen fish need to
02:38 - land on water
02:39 - so sit there fill block type to water
02:42 - so blocks fill with and
02:46 - get into water and we uh
02:50 - set position from negative
02:53 - four negative one minus four
02:59 - oops one then negative
03:02 - four
03:07 - to four negative one four
03:15 - so this will be the place where we
03:17 - create the pond
03:20 - you're all done so we need to get a
03:23 - trident
03:24 - and a kelp let's first look at the
03:27 - python
03:28 - so first death on item and direct
03:31 - [Music]
03:43 - interacted kelp item on item interactive
03:46 - cup so when you use detail
03:48 - it'll run the function then def on item
03:51 - interactive trident so this is for
03:53 - trying
03:53 - for index and range six so repeat six
03:56 - times monster spawn solomon and then
03:58 - random position then
04:00 - clear that one item interact and try it
04:02 - so run the function when you used to try
04:04 - it
04:05 - [Music]
04:12 - first
04:14 - [Music]
04:19 - [Music]
04:26 - uh
04:28 - i think you need to do the lake first
04:31 - then
04:32 - but it's so much trickier to actually
04:34 - it's like you just point it in the sky
04:36 - and then
04:37 - the fish come falling down is those you
04:39 - need to switch very fast
04:44 - really really do you like the pawn
04:48 - then we tried okay let me try that first
04:52 - okay two see
04:56 - now they're surviving and then like
04:59 - they've
04:59 - water spreading everywhere oh no
05:03 - [Music]
05:05 - uh they're getting out of there because
05:07 - they're cute jumping
05:08 - the cows in the water i ain't more
05:11 - solomon
05:12 - okay oopsies the water is getting me
05:16 - away but at least i'm in creative one so
05:18 - i can float
05:21 - oh there's so much they're landing on
05:23 - top of the trees
05:25 - more the lucky lucky ones get to survive
05:31 - oh there's so much
