00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - khalia my name is andrew today we're in
00:05 - minecraft education edition so today
00:08 - we're going to show you the example of
00:11 - hot tub so
00:12 - here it's basically going to create a
00:14 - little pool and you can add soul sand
00:16 - or which we are also going to do magma
00:19 - cubes under so you can make bubbles so
00:22 - hot tubs have bubbles because it's very
00:24 - hot so we're going to add salt sand
00:26 - first okay
00:28 - so on trackman manhattan
00:30 - so you can type hot tub in the chat to
00:33 - run this and then there's also number
00:35 - one so it's a variable so you need to
00:37 - type um a certain
00:39 - number after a hot tub so then it's
00:42 - going to fill with air
00:44 - from zero
00:46 - like clear this space first yeah so it
00:47 - doesn't matter what terrain you're in so
00:49 - from zero
00:50 - negative two to zero
00:53 - to
00:53 - number one negative two number one so
00:56 - you can type the number to see how big
00:59 - your pool will be if you don't type a
01:02 - number it'll just be one block which is
01:04 - very small
01:05 - and then after it fills up air it'll
01:07 - fill with on soul sand
01:09 - the same
01:11 - place where you did the ears
01:13 - and then you will fill with water one
01:16 - block above the um
01:19 - megalithic oils yeah so then we'll have
01:22 - a little pool okay
01:24 - okay now
01:26 - we're going to show you the python
01:30 - okay so def on a chat number one so it's
01:33 - a function you can type a variable um
01:36 - a number
01:38 - for the variable and the block spell the
01:40 - air and then you'll fail you'll clear
01:42 - out the space around you and then it'll
01:45 - block stuff the soul sound in the same
01:47 - position as the air
01:49 - and then it'll fill water right on one
01:52 - block above the source and to create the
01:54 - pool and then player downtown when you
01:56 - type hot tub in the chat it'll run the
01:58 - function
02:00 - now let's try it
02:02 - okay
02:04 - so it goes to chat
02:06 - type
02:07 - 12 let's do which number should we do 10
02:10 - 20 20.
02:14 - oh that's
02:15 - it
02:17 - oh it's because it's 20 by 20 yeah
02:21 - okay now
02:22 - bubbles everywhere
02:25 - and you keep bouncing up
02:28 - because um soul sand and water makes the
02:31 - bubbles go up yeah
02:33 - okay another little bubble look look
02:36 - like the item yeah it keeps getting
02:40 - um bubbles
02:42 - up and up yeah
02:45 - okay so now let's change it to magnitude
02:47 - and maybe try
02:48 - lava oh okay but not gonna be two and a
02:51 - lava doesn't do anything
02:53 - it's just be a marvel crew okay now and
02:56 - change your souls down to that like
02:59 - magical block
03:02 - okay so now i think the bubbles will be
03:05 - different
03:06 - now let's go somewhere else
03:08 - right here
03:10 - uh do it ten by ten i don't want to be
03:13 - twenty okay these twenties a little too
03:16 - big right near
03:25 - but it gets you down yeah now you're
03:28 - stuck and you don't want to suffocate if
03:30 - you're in survival so you need to go
03:32 - somewhere else yeah you get into the
03:34 - regular water on your ground
03:37 - but it's hard to jump
03:39 - yeah because it's
03:40 - sticky
03:46 - but we're in creative mode so we're not
03:48 - getting any damage we're only like
03:50 - watching the show of the like the water
03:53 - drops keep popping everywhere so here
03:56 - the magma cube makes the water sucking
03:58 - down over here
04:01 - it makes your bow
04:03 - um in real life i'll rather it's so
04:05 - stunning
04:06 - so fan it's so sad so i guess you often
04:10 - yeah you keep going up and down as well
04:12 - i'm gonna see if i can can ball myself
04:14 - into there i don't even know how to can
04:17 - up also
04:19 - so you keep bouncing here so it's a
04:20 - little dizzy here it's way more stable
04:23 - but you can get slower and there are
04:25 - water everywhere over your eyes okay
04:28 - we're gonna do a lava pool yeah so let's
04:32 - just fill with lava
04:34 - right here
04:35 - and that makes things fit just like with
04:38 - lava and i don't think a lot um like
04:42 - magma will do any effect because there's
04:44 - already
04:45 - yeah
04:46 - okay
04:53 - is it still sucking down yeah yeah i can
04:56 - barely wait how about getting a glass
04:58 - because let's see i'm like down there
05:01 - what glass and put it like through like
05:04 - in like oh yeah okay you can see food
05:15 - wait like near an edge
05:19 - see it's a magma still right there yeah
05:21 - this magma fits with lava so i don't
05:23 - think it gets burned
05:26 - because it's still fire
05:27 - yeah
05:29 - oh that's so cool it's still there
05:31 - and then when you
05:32 - break your glass like over here you put
05:35 - grass
05:36 - and then you go here you can
05:39 - get mad
05:40 - or like um you can watch the show
05:48 - well it's
05:49 - yeah
05:50 - okay it's cool i like lava better
05:52 - because it's more cool yeah okay well
