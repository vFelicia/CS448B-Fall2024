03:49 - calculate and display the answer to
03:50 - these three expressions that are on the
03:52 - tv monitors
03:53 - can you write some some code in the
03:57 - coding window to calculate the correct
03:59 - answer and then press the corresponding
04:01 - button
04:03 - now we are going to go here and when you
04:05 - press the answer that is right
04:07 - so i'm going to do this in
04:10 - decoding so it says look at each of the
04:12 - tv monitors
04:14 - calculate the sum using code to use the
04:16 - mathematical value of numbers in the
04:18 - command quiz should not be used
04:20 - for example we can do player that say
04:22 - one plus one
04:23 - so it will say the answer of one plus
04:26 - one in the chat
04:27 - which is two so when this code is run it
