00:01 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - Kalia today we're in Minecraft
00:07 - education Edition and in the Iowa Code
00:11 - Escape estate so in the last video we
00:14 - completed that half of the
00:17 - um kitchen and in this video we're going
00:19 - to complete this so there's a skeleton
00:22 - zombie with a skeleton and uh oh sorry
00:27 - that's a creeper and this is a zombie
00:29 - okay so let's see what we're gonna need
00:32 - to do so let's press C
00:40 - the silly zombie Chef gave everyone the
00:43 - wrong meals see if you can figure out
00:45 - who wants to what meal use the swap
00:48 - plate function to swap the plates on
00:51 - either side of the colored tablecloth
00:53 - you define
00:54 - so we can swap orange blue yellow and
00:57 - Magneta so it's like if I
01:01 - if I swap orange then this way and this
01:05 - plate with a food will swap okay
01:08 - over here on the wall there is saying
01:11 - something with the mobs want so the
01:13 - creeper wants down the
01:16 - creeper drumstick the skeleton wants a
01:19 - bowl of skeletons of Bones
01:23 - um the zombie wants some rotten flesh
01:26 - and then the with the skeleton wants
01:30 - maybe uh something that's black and
01:32 - that's a fish
01:33 - okay so they have to follow me let's see
01:36 - so this the one that sambini zombie has
01:42 - is forced the skeleton so we have to do
01:45 - blue and then this one will be over here
01:49 - it'll have to go to the yellow
01:52 - so let's first do the blue and then the
01:56 - magnetic because then
01:58 - at um the
02:01 - skeleton and Creeper will have what they
02:04 - want and then we just need to switch the
02:06 - yellow to so the zombie has what he
02:09 - wants well it wants and the Wither
02:11 - Skeleton has what it wants so let's go
02:13 - to code
02:15 - example so this is wrong it's just
02:17 - showing us what it will do okay okay oh
02:22 - oh this is another way you can just do
02:25 - Magneto after that okay let's see
02:27 - so the zombie Chef must place the order
02:30 - where could it have gone figure out
02:33 - which meal belongs to who then write a
02:35 - program to place the Muse in front of
02:37 - the correct mop so let's see what this
02:40 - does first
02:42 - okay okay okay
02:45 - oh that doesn't work so we're gonna do
02:49 - blue Magneto and then yellow
02:52 - so
02:53 - swap place
02:58 - swap
03:00 - plates
03:02 - uh
03:04 - blue
03:08 - blue
03:10 - first
03:11 - then oopsies
03:14 - then we're gonna do is swap plates again
03:20 - Magneta
03:22 - and then lastly we're gonna do yellow
03:31 - yellow okay let's see
03:36 - okay okay
03:40 - wait they're eating it oh
03:43 - cool
03:45 - they ate it so now they're
03:48 - um their plates are cleared cool
03:52 - okay so we cleared this room so in the
03:54 - next video we'll go through that
