00:00 - welcome to cocooning with kids my name
00:02 - is clea and my name is andrew
00:04 - today we're a minecraft education
00:06 - edition and we're going to
00:07 - do the make a job so we're going to go
00:11 - to
00:11 - code and it's one of the tutorials in
00:15 - microsoft make code and this is the mega
00:18 - jump
00:19 - we're gonna start the block tutorial
00:23 - just the agent moving with a chest
00:27 - oh look you can jump so high more than
00:29 - usual
00:31 - so it says put in and on chat command
00:34 - and rename it to
00:35 - duck so if when we type jump in the chat
00:39 - we're gonna mega jump yeah
00:42 - place the teleport inside on check
00:45 - command to teleport deploy 100 blocks or
00:47 - higher
00:48 - so we need a teleport to zero zero zero
00:51 - so the zero zero zero
00:52 - is the position of where we jump
00:58 - jump
01:00 - [Music]
01:01 - we stayed at the same place because it's
01:04 - zero zero
01:04 - zero which is exactly where the player
01:07 - is yeah
01:08 - so we need a code more
01:11 - next add a number parameter called num1
01:15 - which is number one
01:16 - to uncheck command in blocks click on
01:19 - the plus sign so i need so you can
01:23 - like type type how many blocks you want
01:26 - to jump
01:27 - after you type jump is the variable num1
01:33 - then it says use num1 variable instead
01:36 - of 100 in the code so that you will jump
01:38 - by the map entered by the player
01:40 - so you will put the num one in into the
01:44 - middle
01:46 - so now we're gonna go into the chat and
01:48 - then
01:49 - type let's test it out by jumping 50
01:52 - blocks
01:52 - you jump 50 ah
01:56 - oh man you need to go into water before
02:00 - you do the convenience so now we're
02:02 - gonna do
02:02 - we're gonna try a hundred we're gonna
02:04 - try greater numbers
02:07 - wait wait we're not close oh we're
02:10 - jumping into the water
02:12 - we survived that was so hot yeah
02:15 - let's see if it has any more for us to
02:17 - do
02:18 - so that is it yeah i'm going to try a
02:22 - thousand sure okay
02:25 - then but if you don't want if you don't
02:29 - see any
02:29 - water source you should get a water
02:32 - pumpkin yeah so you do
02:33 - jump jump
02:38 - and i know the code to do to
02:41 - the agent to give you you know
02:44 - water buckets we are like so high yeah
02:47 - if we don't splash into water where are
02:49 - we
02:49 - oh we're going to the clouds
02:53 - oh oh we were late i did not realize
02:55 - that we were
02:56 - like we were like falling so bad
02:59 - i'm gonna do the code where you can like
03:02 - the agent gives
03:03 - you some water buckets
03:06 - water in the chakra and you take water
03:09 - it will do
03:11 - [Music]
03:15 - blocks go to blocks and
03:18 - [Music]
03:21 - it will you need to let
03:24 - you know um give you type
03:28 - given the search give nearest player
03:32 - yourself yourself
03:36 - a blocker item and we need to change
03:39 - that into item so we're going to change
03:43 - it
03:44 - into a water
03:47 - bucket we need to go to the item we need
03:50 - to get
03:51 - a new one which is the items
03:54 - and because it's an item not a block
03:58 - so then we search water
04:01 - and there is a water bucket and you can
04:04 - do however
04:05 - mountain ones so if we type
04:09 - water into the chat you'll get one water
04:11 - bucket
04:12 - so now we have a water bucket so now
04:16 - we're gonna jump how about a hundred
04:19 - jump a hundred let's see if we
04:27 - late i'm going oh try again water
04:31 - okay now i'm going to jump a hundred
04:40 - oh
04:42 - nice get the water buckets because we
04:44 - didn't use it
04:45 - it's down one more time jump
04:48 - how about 150 to give me more time okay
04:52 - i'm gonna do it now
04:54 - oh shoot oh
04:58 - [Music]
05:07 - and so this is the pie finality code
05:10 - so def on on chat num1 so when you type
05:13 - the jump
05:14 - you'll do player dot teleport position
05:16 - then num1 zero num100 so it'll teleport
05:20 - you
05:20 - and then player.on chat jump on on chat
05:24 - so there's death on on chat too because
05:27 - it's number two
05:27 - yeah because it'll run both things when
05:31 - you type something in the chat
05:32 - so do mobs documents so the mob is the
05:35 - agent target dot target local player
05:39 - which is
05:40 - uh water bucket one so it give us one
05:43 - water
05:44 - if we change the one into
05:47 - about ten okay
05:51 - 10 so now it'll give us 10
05:55 - and then let's see did the code change
05:59 - here
05:59 - yes yes so now we're going to try it if
06:02 - it gives us 10 water buckets
06:04 - water we have 10 water buckets
06:07 - okay let's go into the water oh yeah
06:10 - make
06:11 - more like water streams
06:14 - so now we're going to do this in case if
