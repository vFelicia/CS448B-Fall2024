00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're in coda
00:06 - art so the instruction says
00:09 - flappy will fly right through obstacles
00:13 - unless you write
00:15 - code to make him crash attach a block to
00:18 - the
00:18 - one hit an obstacle event so that the
00:22 - game ends when flappy crashes into the
00:25 - first set of pipes
00:28 - so crash is when is end game
00:32 - because when it hit the ground it
00:34 - crashed two so
00:35 - end game wait wait
00:39 - wait okay
00:48 - yes because there is somewhere you need
00:51 - a a
00:52 - man so now the instruction says we're
00:55 - adding a scoreboard
00:57 - board to count points when flappy passes
01:00 - obstacles add a block to the
01:04 - when pass an obstacle event that scores
01:07 - a point then press
01:08 - run to fly through the first set of
01:11 - pipes
01:12 - so one run is set speeds to normal
01:17 - one hit ground end game one hit an
01:20 - obstacle
01:20 - end game one click flap on normal amount
01:23 - but
01:23 - we don't have a one past obstacle so we
01:27 - need to score a point
01:30 - so um there will be a scoreboard
01:33 - see there is zero because we didn't pass
01:35 - any pipe yet
01:36 - we got one point yay
01:41 - now it says click the down arrow inside
01:45 - of the flap a normal amount block
01:48 - to pick a different flapping power see
01:51 - if you can still score a point
01:52 - after making floppy flap either a small
01:56 - or large amount each time
01:58 - you click
02:01 - set wait wait wait flap
