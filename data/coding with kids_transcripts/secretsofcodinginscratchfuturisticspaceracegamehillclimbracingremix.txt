00:00 - welcome to clinton with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in scratch and
00:06 - andrew's account starring scratch cat so
00:08 - today i'm going to show you my remix
00:10 - called futuristic space race
00:12 - so first
00:14 - it
00:14 - was a hill climb race so i changed it
00:18 - into a space scene so
00:21 - um like there's no wheel and you're in
00:24 - outer space yeah so it's also futuristic
00:27 - because you know right now
00:29 - you can't like drive a car without a wii
00:32 - u yeah maybe in the future you can't say
00:34 - yeah
00:35 - so first in the background
00:38 - here it was originally just a game
00:40 - background so i changed it into space
00:42 - stream and add the feel score and
00:44 - personal best maybe you're racing on the
00:46 - moon yeah and then here in the car
00:50 - i had a star to make some deco races
00:53 - and then in the items i changed your
00:56 - coins instead of yellow to black because
00:59 - it's just so much space themed
01:01 - black is the color or white but these
01:04 - letters are white so you shouldn't make
01:06 - white so here in the wheel i erased
01:08 - everything
01:09 - because then
01:10 - the car and the motorcycle won't have
01:13 - any wheels and then you'll be
01:15 - floating yeah it's like
01:17 - [Music]
01:19 - but there's still dirt kicking up maybe
01:22 - it's like like this thing is that push
01:25 - the um car forward it will like kick up
01:28 - dirt maybe it's another alien planet
01:31 - that has still has dirt
01:33 - only like like um
01:35 - the moon with the
01:37 - earth but like in another place that is
01:40 - not really ours so human can bring
01:43 - i guess okay so first i want to do call
01:47 - right yeah
01:48 - you press
01:49 - to change and then use your arrow keys i
01:53 - like motorcycle more because like
01:55 - it's faster and it's more bumpy yeah
01:59 - like i think the motorcycle is more
02:01 - harder
02:03 - i like it
02:04 - uh
02:05 - oh oh
02:08 - oh
02:10 - oh man
02:11 - it's like kind of easier because you
02:13 - don't have wheels yeah but it's also
02:16 - kind of harder because you don't know

03:03 - right here oh what else now they want to
03:06 - do car
03:07 - okay car it has a star yeah it's a match
03:11 - of the star this is because it's space
03:15 - the car is a little bit easier it's not
03:17 - that hill i'm not even pressing the
03:19 - arrow keys right now
03:20 - i pressed too much in the start
03:24 - okay
