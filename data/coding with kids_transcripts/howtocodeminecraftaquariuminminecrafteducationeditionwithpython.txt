00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:02 - kalia is andrew today i'm on minecraft
00:05 - education edition and we're going to do
00:07 - one of those tutorials make
00:09 - microsoft record
00:11 - so
00:14 - in the
00:16 - [Music]
00:28 - a nice cozy aquarium for our reference
00:33 - we'll make it
00:34 - so our aquarium is built when we swing a
00:37 - trident add on item use your code and
00:40 - set the item type to try so the trident
00:42 - matches the aquarium because like the
00:44 - trend is supposed to be in water
00:46 - yeah
00:49 - so
00:50 - where's the trident uh
01:03 - [Music]
01:08 - [Music]
01:23 - a size of eight times eight protect my d
01:26 -  hold enough specimen change default
01:30 - from position to five zero negative ten
01:33 - into position two twelve seven ten in
01:36 - your fifth be smaller than twelve at the
01:43 - [Music]
01:49 - [Music]
01:54 - negative 10.
01:56 - um
02:00 - [Music]
02:07 - [Music]
02:08 - i want to
02:09 - hold it
02:11 - and set the block type to water we only
02:13 - want to fill the inside of the aquarium
02:15 - so set the front position to 6 1
02:19 - negative 9 and 2 position two
02:22 - eleven six nine so it's like very close
02:25 - to these numbers so we'll fill
02:28 - so we're gonna fill the case with water
02:30 - because clearly it's an aquarium so it
02:33 - needs water yeah so it's from
02:36 - six six
02:38 - one
02:39 - negative nine whoa that was a big
02:42 - chicken noise
02:43 - eleven six nine
02:47 - [Music]
02:49 - here's the oops
02:50 - and then nine okay
02:52 - the aquarium is ready to be populated
02:56 - well
02:56 - one more fish and
02:59 - coral living inside it so we'll need a
03:02 - repeat loop to create them off add one
03:05 - to the clothes
03:06 - [Music]
03:09 - how many times i don't know let's see
03:13 - more times
03:15 - let's start with the fish
03:17 - put in a sponge inside the repeat loop
03:20 - and change the animal type to your
03:21 - favorite fish okay so i'm not going to
03:24 - do um tropical fish because there's more
03:26 - types
03:28 - colorized
03:29 - tropical fish
03:34 - [Music]
03:44 - i'll pick random position inside the
03:46 - spawn and change the front and two
03:48 - positions to the same area as the water
03:51 - six one negative nine and eleven six
03:55 - nine
03:57 - random positions
03:58 - [Music]
03:59 - because we don't want all the fish to
04:01 - spawn at the same place so six
04:04 - six one
04:06 - negative nine
04:09 - eleven
04:10 - six
04:12 - nine
04:16 - [Music]
04:19 - drag a place inside the repeat loop and
04:22 - set the block type to your favorite
04:24 - coral drag a
04:26 - pick random position inside it and
04:28 - change the positions to six one negative
04:31 - nine and eleven zero nine three
04:33 - corresponds on the floor now we're gonna
04:35 - do the coral okay so we need a place
04:40 - we're gonna
04:53 - [Music]
05:02 - [Music]
05:04 - because we both like blue
05:06 - as our favorite color so six six oops
05:10 - yeah six
05:12 - one one
05:13 - negative nine it's always the same
05:16 - number
05:17 - eleven
05:18 - six zero oops zero nine
05:22 - so we didn't really
05:25 - bring your aquarium to life by adding
05:27 - more fish and coral in the repeat block
05:30 - to speed up the process copy
05:32 - place or spawn and insert when you're
05:35 - done go in game and use a trident to see
05:38 - your aquarium tanks so we're gonna just
05:40 - do the repeat more
05:42 - okay so
05:43 - how about
05:45 - 70.
05:46 - but that only will be 70 fishes and 70
05:49 - corals
05:56 - [Music]
06:03 - which is defined on item interactive
06:05 - trident so that's the name blocks the
06:08 - fill glass
06:10 - position five zero negative ten position
06:12 - twelve seven ten fill operation that
06:14 - replace so this will make the glass cage
06:17 - or like tank then we're going to fill
06:19 - the water
06:20 - with the same command as the glass
06:23 - to put water inside the tank then we're
06:25 - going to do four index and range 70
06:27 - repeat 70 times mob stop spawn tropical
06:30 - fish in random positions
06:32 - then we're going to do the same to the
06:34 - tube coral and then
06:36 - we're going to run the function when
06:38 - playing that on item interactive try so
06:40 - when we interact with the china so we're
06:42 - going to run the function yeah okay now
06:45 - let's do it okay so first we're gonna
06:48 - try to get a trident so we're gonna
06:51 - create it
06:53 - we recommend you to do this in creative
06:55 - because it's very hard to get a try for
06:57 - you
06:58 - let's set it here
07:07 - some of them are breaking even through
07:09 - glass because they're blaster
07:13 - i think too much
07:18 - [Music]
07:24 - it's pretty cool though but we have to
07:27 - change stuff here
07:29 - but still when you look inside there's
07:31 - lots of colorful fish right right we
07:33 - made two we made two because yeah
07:35 - because i didn't use it
07:37 - so that's why there was a holes and
07:39 - stuff
07:40 - so
07:41 - this is this is dry coral it's a dead
07:43 - one
07:44 - yeah
07:46 - but the chicken's like
07:47 - chicken has a
07:49 - chicken
07:50 - well there's still a lot of fish and
07:53 - floating corals okay
07:56 - um
07:56 - maybe we should add different kind of
07:58 - this one
08:00 - they're all gonna help okay let's go
08:02 - somewhere else so we won't here we don't
08:04 - want to follow me
08:06 - this is my choice i think yeah okay
08:09 - okay
08:09 - move over here
08:11 - okay we need to change some cold
08:14 - so go back to box
08:18 - so
08:19 - we first don't need the seven
08:22 - i don't want the same kind of fish
08:24 - so i think it will just spawn
08:27 - 10 of every fish
08:30 - how about 30
08:32 - and 130 that would be too much
08:36 - okay so
08:38 - i'm
08:39 - add one more
08:42 - kind
08:44 - so let's do
08:46 - which one you still have these three
08:49 - yeah
08:50 - okay uh how about i like this okay fire
08:53 - coral and can we add um a dolphin
08:57 - dolphins yeah they're very big
09:02 - yeah
09:04 - all right one dolphin if you don't know
09:07 - turn it off or we could do
09:10 - it would be so funny
09:12 - on a panda in it
09:15 - if hannah was have a squid okay no i
09:18 - don't like squids
09:20 - sea turtles
09:24 - oh it's night time
09:26 - okay let's first make it in the morning
09:27 - first
09:28 - uh
09:30 - time
09:31 - day
09:33 - okay
09:44 - yeah so good thing the turtles are there
09:50 - there's like this glitch that the turtle
09:52 - spawns right in the glass i just tried
09:54 - to do it only one time
09:58 - away from
10:01 - but it's still very big
10:14 - so many turtles over here
10:16 - uh not much in the aquarium oh i thought
10:20 - i saw a fish like
10:22 - like being the waterfall
10:25 - turtles the turtles what well there's
10:28 - the chicken the chicken is getting wet
10:30 - and it's like there's black and white
10:34 - the chicken just got squished
10:36 - okay i don't think we could put one
10:39 - because
10:40 - if only we were a spider i mean the cave
10:44 - spider now we
10:46 - wow
10:48 - if we had night vision it would be like
10:50 - so much better i tried it when i went
10:52 - into like a ocean
