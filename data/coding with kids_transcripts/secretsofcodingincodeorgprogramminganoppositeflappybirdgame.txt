00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:06 - we're in coda og and this
00:08 - is called opposite flappy game plus
00:11 - random
00:12 - because it's random and opposite
00:14 - wrapping
00:15 - c one hits the ground endgame one hit an
00:18 - obstacle
00:19 - score a point when pass obstacle
00:22 - end game when click flap um
00:25 - random map c because it's
00:29 - really um
00:32 - and crazy it's very slow because
00:35 - except when runs the obstacle random set
00:40 - um ground random set scenes
00:43 - that play are randoms that score when
00:46 - set scores zero can't be random
00:50 - speeds random so that's what i'm super
00:53 - slow
00:54 - which is bad that's why i don't really
00:56 - like super slow
00:57 - now this is faster good
01:01 - so when you go through the pipes with
01:03 - you
01:04 - um in the real flat begin you have to
01:08 - put this to the opposite one okay let's
01:11 - add more
01:12 - hmm one flap set player two
01:16 - random then one hit obstacle
01:19 - so seems too random
01:23 - i always choose random cause
01:26 - when it hit obstacle the next time i'll
01:28 - stay the same
01:30 - okay now when
01:34 - um hit an obstacle press
01:37 - uh point
01:48 - i don't think that's that will be good
01:54 - hmm let's see
01:58 - oh that's a good end game sound
02:02 - but not really so one pass obstacle
02:06 - hmm smash
02:10 - yes then when this set
02:14 - play flap sound
02:20 - uh
02:23 - okay let's try that
02:26 - so when i click every time it change
02:29 - characters
02:31 - [Music]
02:33 - so i keep clicking
02:38 - so you and one is
02:42 - because it's quite smashed now let's
02:46 - hit the ground after one point
02:50 - [Music]
02:52 - oh man i hated that
02:57 - did you hear it it was a little bit too
03:02 - um the endgame sound was a little bit
03:04 - too soft
03:05 - so okay let's play
03:09 - sad okay let's press reset
03:13 - run see
03:17 - and let's see hmm this is
03:21 - gravity i forgot gravity
03:26 - first so i'll just do this gravity
03:29 - it will be a little bit harder
03:32 - to set a normal no
03:36 - it's a random gap
03:44 - that says so slow
03:47 - so now i will skip every super slow ones
03:51 - this is not very slow
03:53 - [Music]
03:55 - the gravity it's like
03:58 - very hard sometimes let's set gravity to
04:02 - very high
04:07 - very hard i would keep clicking to go up
04:11 - or i'm gonna fall
04:15 - gravity too very low
04:20 - well uh i can see myself
04:23 - that will be very bad but it's tricky
04:28 - but it's random much better
04:34 - just now i can't stand the two slow
04:40 - games
04:42 - so i skip it
04:43 - [Music]
04:49 - i just love that sounds like somebody
04:50 - slapping it in other
04:52 - person's face
04:56 - [Music]
