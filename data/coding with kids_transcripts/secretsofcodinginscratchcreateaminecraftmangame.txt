00:11 - so you can see here it's basically
00:13 - pac-man but it's changed to like a
00:16 - minecraft form
00:19 - space to start
00:20 - the zombie villagers with ender portals
00:24 - one other
00:25 - and there's diamonds

01:07 - are all
01:08 - uh
01:09 - those ghosts
01:10 - so basically instead of ghosts they're
01:14 - zombie villagers
01:16 - then when you get the diamonds you chain
01:18 - they become vulnerable and you can eat

01:32 - they all have zombie villagers then
01:34 - villagers so it's the same for clyde
01:37 - pinky and inky
01:40 - okay then in the fruit the bonus fruit i
01:43 - changed the first the berry to minecraft
01:46 - berry and
01:47 - the apple to minecraft apple so
01:49 - originally it was a green apple the
01:52 - power palette when you turn the zombie
01:53 - villagers into villagers i turned it
01:56 - into diamonds so
01:58 - in the front here like this
02:00 - starting menu uh you can call me i
02:02 - changed it to minecraft man then i added
02:05 - instead of ghost chasing pac-man with
02:07 - the pellet i did zombie heads

02:16 - portals for decoration because when you
02:17 - go in the edge transport to the other
02:20 - side and i also added sun i don't think
