00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Minecraft education Edition and the auto
00:07 - code Escape estate so we went through
00:10 - the portal and now let's go see it's
00:12 - like a Garden Room gardening room with
00:14 - lots of plants okay so that's such room
00:17 - for particles right click particles okay
00:19 - button
00:21 - oh now there's a fountain
00:24 - the the fastest thing is kind of broken
00:26 - because there's broken uh blocks and
00:29 - it's leaking water okay
00:32 - oh it's a box missing I think the water
00:35 - isn't like I think the water is supposed
00:37 - to go here okay
00:41 - here maybe this is for planting
00:44 - mushrooms I think it's water supposed to
00:48 - go for I don't know okay
00:54 - so now let's see to code to see what we
00:57 - have to fix okay
01:03 - you need more water and it looks like
01:05 - those cracked blocks are leaking use the
01:08 - move cursor going into position the
01:10 - cursor over cracked block and then break
01:12 - block to break it and let the water flow
01:15 - into the canal okay so the cursor we
01:19 - have is right there with the orange blue
01:22 - magenta and yellow okay
01:24 - okay
01:25 - so we have to go break these blocks the
01:28 - ones that are broken with dripping water
01:30 - should be um
01:31 - yeah they should be broken so the wire
01:35 - would go through
01:37 - so let's go let's run this example so
01:40 - this is an example it won't work okay
01:43 - okay
01:52 - so this is the same you can also do for
01:54 - Iron Range to do uh the command multiple
01:57 - times it's the same command like it's
01:59 - the same thing except it's just in a
02:01 - repeat Loop okay let's see here so let's
02:03 - see what this does first okay go down
02:06 - and then okay
02:08 - so we do not need to break that block so
02:11 - this code actually works so I think we
02:13 - need to go yellow two more times yeah
02:16 - and it will be have to be before they
02:19 - break Brock okay so go we're just gonna
02:21 - make a
02:23 - we're just gonna make a loop
02:26 - here so it's gonna be easier
02:30 - so we're looking for eye in the Range
02:33 - four times
02:35 - four times
02:37 - and then remember to add the tab
02:40 - only tap the move cursor so it can only
02:45 - that command will be
02:47 - okay break the first one
02:50 - break the seconds okay now we need to go
02:52 - to the bottom so we go two times magenta
02:55 - and then one time blue and then break
02:57 - block
02:58 - times matchup
03:04 - from
03:07 - oopsies
03:18 - um magenta
03:20 - two times
03:25 - so we can
03:27 - reach it so then we have to move
03:31 - sir
03:33 - blue
03:37 - and then like break a block
03:42 - please
03:44 - can then break block
03:46 - break
03:49 - block
03:50 - okay now let's run it and then we should
03:52 - break up three out of four blocks
03:57 - so now we have one more last one so I
04:00 - think we should go blue one blue and
04:03 - then two oh two times blue and two times
04:06 - magenta okay so let's go back to code
04:20 - yeah okay
04:25 - and then two times magenta
04:40 - and then last but not least break block
04:49 - one first one
05:04 - but the water is going into there the
05:07 - holes
05:11 - so I think we need to repair the
05:17 - oh no holes in the canal stop the water
05:20 - from flowing into the garden fill those
05:22 - holes to help the water along I used to
05:24 - move cursive funky to position the
05:25 - cursor over a hole and then Place Buffs
05:27 - to fill it in okay so let's see this
05:29 - color basically repair okay so this code
05:33 - example
05:34 - first glow Gold Blocks okay so it did
05:38 - the first two and then one two okay okay
05:41 - let's see
05:45 - okay so let's also do loops
05:49 - and then now over here so let's see what
05:51 - this does first
05:53 - first one second one
05:56 - okay one okay so this is good we need to
05:59 - go orange and then Place block okay
06:06 - beautiful cursor
06:08 - Orange
06:11 - and place block place
06:15 - okay then we should be all done with two
06:19 - okay
06:21 - okay oh no oh wait go back to code
06:25 - oh you forgot to add it okay
06:28 - okay this should work
06:31 - one two
06:32 - three four okay so now we still have two
06:36 - more holes so blue blue
06:39 - and an orange place block and then
06:42 - orange
06:43 - [Music]
06:55 - and then orange
06:58 - Place black and orange place block
07:02 - place
07:04 - and the same thing
07:08 - oh yeah
07:13 - okay
07:15 - I in range two times
07:22 - and add tabs to both move cursor and
07:26 - face block
07:28 - okay now run it and ish brick okay okay
07:31 - one two
07:34 - three four
07:37 - five
07:38 - six it's not fixed it so now the water
07:41 - should flow all the way so now the four
07:44 - blocks is appear and it's going to the
07:46 - mushrooms
07:47 - oh the mushrooms are growing the
07:50 - mushrooms we can use all mushrooms
07:52 - medium Russian and big oh we're supposed
07:55 - to go on to wait oh whoopsies
08:12 - wow there's more flowers and we can
08:14 - water them okay let's see
08:18 - but let's see to see what we have to do
08:21 - then we have the cursor and we have
08:22 - these uh flowers the concrete blocks
08:25 - okay so let's see
08:28 - there's some pattern with these flowers
08:30 - figure out the pattern and plant the
08:32 - flowers in the empty dirt using the move
08:34 - Chrissy to position the cursor in the
08:36 - plant flower supplies to pull out so
08:38 - there's a pattern let's see
08:40 - um oh the flu red and yellow flowers so
08:44 - the I think the first row the wine with
08:47 - the blue flower is also possibly blue
08:49 - and then yellow and then the red yeah
08:52 - over there is a blue one yeah so let's
08:55 - do that
08:58 - are you sure only uh the dark gray the
09:02 - dark brown or the only the brown I think
09:04 - all of them
09:06 - okay okay let's go code example
09:11 - [Music]
09:13 - so code example
09:18 - red one a rose but we should plant the
09:22 - yellow dandelion
09:24 - back to cutting and then this is also
09:26 - blue and it will be way better okay so
09:29 - let's go back here and let's see
09:35 - no it's not it's showing us that the
09:38 - actually that row is blue this Rose
09:41 - yellow and this rose red so it's
09:42 - actually not okay
09:45 - here that should be good and then we
09:48 - have to repeat this how many times
09:50 - let's see
09:53 - uh
09:54 - so that will be wait plant file one two
09:58 - three four five five times
10:12 - no three one two three four five okay
10:18 - okay so now we need to move down magenta
10:22 - okay yellow okay let's go
10:27 - um move cursor
10:31 - magenta
10:35 - I am rage five times
10:46 - flower yellow
10:51 - and then we will have to do move
10:55 - for sure I think it's orange
10:59 - see check no it's blue oopsies
11:08 - you should be done with the first two
11:10 - rows
11:14 - okay
11:18 - so now we need to move magenta and then
11:21 - Red Bull
11:23 - yeah yeah oopsies
11:26 - let's go back here then move cursor
11:30 - magenta
11:34 - sometimes before I range five times
11:40 - plant flower
11:45 - red red and then we'll have to do move
11:49 - cursor yellow
11:52 - okay
11:55 - one should be done gardening
11:59 - wait oh each time we have a concrete
12:03 - blocks are also changing along with our
12:04 - flower okay let's see
12:06 - head overhead it looks so cool
12:10 - okay now we're done
12:12 - enter the next room where is the portal
12:15 - over here so let's see this again like
12:18 - this is really cool in my personal
12:20 - opinion I think there should be more
12:22 - torches near the mushrooms because it's
12:24 - very dark well it's really only lanterns
12:26 - here
12:27 - because like this Garden this is some
12:30 - Secret Life
12:32 - yeah I don't think uh Lanterns have that
12:35 - much delight yeah I know okay
12:39 - no next video well that was fun and
12:44 - that's it for today thank you for
12:45 - watching Remember to smash like button
