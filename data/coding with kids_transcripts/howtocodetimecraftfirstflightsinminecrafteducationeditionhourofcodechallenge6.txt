00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:05 - education edition and we're in timeout
00:08 - which is an hour of code yes so we need
00:12 - to select a time split
00:14 - let's say that this one which is like a
00:17 - balloon with a car balloon that is tied
00:20 - to a car that's weird go through time
00:22 - let's go yay get the brief get free
00:26 - here's a time speed where airplanes
00:28 - never took off literally now everyone is
00:31 - using balloons to travel but that idea
00:34 - is just full of hot air yeah that's
00:36 - weird yeah there are no airplanes now
00:38 - everyone's using balloons that's kind of
00:40 - risky even if it pops then it goes down
00:44 - travel to the united states during the
00:46 - early nineteen thousands and make sure
00:48 - the first flight ticks to the skies okay
00:51 - and enter the pot
00:52 - button
00:54 - press it
00:56 - in
01:01 - united states of america 1900 okay
01:04 - flight engineer where did these holes in
01:06 - my runway come from they'll never get
01:08 - enough speed to lift off now if this
01:10 - flight fails people will continue to
01:12 - mock me from their air balloons and will
01:14 - never fly like the bird this flight
01:16 - engineer is trying to make um
01:18 - planes but the people that are using
01:21 - balloons mock him so he's trying to
01:23 - prove that airplanes actually work tara
01:26 - oh no it looks like the flight engineer
01:28 - is about to give up let's fix this
01:30 - airstrip start your mission by using
01:32 - your talk device to call the time agent
01:34 - okay use the top device
01:36 - start activity
01:38 - so the time returns here you can see
01:40 - hot air balloons tear fantastic now that
01:42 - the timing is in place let's use code to
01:44 - repair the run away there are holes in
01:46 - the runway
01:48 - right here there's holes here and look
01:50 - you can see balloons hot air balloons
01:53 - yeah so we need to do this run away like
01:56 - like fix it and then um airplanes will
01:58 - be back so that's
02:00 - code code
02:06 - one of the first airplanes is about to
02:08 - take off but there are holes in the
02:09 - runway so if there are holes in the
02:11 - runway you can't take off yeah because
02:13 - they the um road will be very bumpy code
02:17 - your asian to fill the holes with dirt
02:19 - blocks we've given it okay so let's see
02:21 - where the hole is
02:23 - so there are several holes
02:25 - to here
02:26 - right in front of the edges so let's fix
02:28 - these first
02:30 - okay first we need to move forward then
02:32 - we're going to place down down
02:34 - repeat it two times
02:36 - down
02:38 - two times yeah
02:40 - yeah four times two
02:44 - so
02:45 - um the asian already has dirt blocks in
02:48 - this inventory cool so now we need to
02:50 - move forward two times and turn turn
02:53 - right move right
02:55 - two times
02:56 - so let's see let's just put it forward
02:59 - by one by two just
03:09 - yeah move sideways agent move we don't
03:12 - need to repeat
03:14 - we don't need to repeat oh yeah
03:18 - move four by two and move right by two
03:21 - okay let's go
03:24 - one two one two okay okay now we do the
03:26 - exact same thing we did at the first
03:29 - time
03:30 - now let's just move here and move
03:33 - repeat two times agent move one time and
03:37 - agent
03:38 - place down oopsies
03:41 - place
03:42 - down
03:45 - bounty down down
03:49 - okay you can go yay
03:51 - still two more holes so it's the same
03:53 - path it's like repeated three times so
03:56 - you can do a whole larger program but
03:59 - with more repeat loops yeah then you can
04:01 - do it one time
04:03 - stand
04:05 - do this
04:07 - let's go let's go
04:09 - oh that's so fast
04:11 - now this is uplifting that's a pun
04:14 - runway has been restored let's give this
04:16 - glider another try sure man
04:19 - congratulations time split repair
04:22 - great good job you've repaired this
04:24 - moment in time thanks to your code
04:26 - modern flight has been saved and people
04:28 - can again travel anywhere
04:30 - in the world in hours
04:32 - now flight is more out faster scanning
04:35 - it's scanning
04:37 - detected
04:40 - okay let's see search area oh it's right
04:42 - there i just saw it up here
04:44 - press it yeah
04:46 - oh
04:48 - it's right outside you found the secret
04:51 - room take note of which time agents you
04:53 - see here and head back to the institute
04:56 - there is pixie and yeti
05:00 - that's end mission
05:03 - which time jumping pixie pixie sus
05:07 - no yes this is
05:13 - okay
05:14 - so now we're going to do other time
05:15 - splits in other videos yeah okay well
05:19 - now there's a on plane yeah the planes
05:23 - got back i think this is the engineer
05:26 - yeah
05:28 - so now the planes come back yeah okay
05:30 - well that was fun and that's it for
05:33 - today thank you for watching remember to
05:36 - smash the like button and subscribe bye
05:38 - bye
