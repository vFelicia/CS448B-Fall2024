00:01 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - CIA and my name is Andrew today we're
00:05 - going to make a game in Python with chot
00:07 - gbt So today we're going to make a game
00:10 - you called number War where you can Bas
00:12 - basically choose a random number and you
00:15 - have to compete with who has the highest
00:17 - number with the computer so to make this
00:19 - game more fun we made it so that you can
00:22 - choose whatever number you want
00:24 - but uh if you choose 10 all the time it
00:27 - won't always work because we also um
00:30 - have a range of numbers -3 to three or
00:33 - you can modify it which will add or
00:35 - subtract that number to your number so
00:38 - you can't always have win also there
00:41 - will be a number of rounds and a winning
00:43 - score so now let's see the
00:46 - code we have import random which is a
00:49 - random module then we have a get player
00:52 - input function so while true we're going
00:54 - to try number input so it ask us choose
00:57 - the number between 1 and 10 then we're
00:59 - going to
01:00 - put a number then know is variable
01:02 - offset equals random randit which is
01:05 - this function from the random module
01:07 - this is the number change this is the
01:10 - range of how our number can be change
01:13 - from -3 to three then the final number
01:16 - is the player number plus the
01:19 - offset then if one is less than final
01:23 - one is less or equals to final number
01:25 - and final number is less than equals to
01:27 - 10 because that's our number range
01:29 - before the final number that's the same
01:32 - range for the computer too then print
01:34 - your final number and then it show it'll
01:36 - show your final number then return the
01:38 - number else then it say invalid Choice
01:42 - the F number is out of range please
01:44 - choose
01:45 - again then is value error if you don't
01:47 - input a number it'll do invalid input
01:50 - please enter a valid number then we have
01:53 - another function called play round we
01:55 - have a variable called player number and
01:57 - computer
01:58 - number the computer will choose a random
02:01 - number through 1 and 10 then it's going
02:04 - to show your number and the computer's
02:06 - number if your number is more than the
02:08 - computer number it print you win this
02:10 - round and then return one then if the
02:13 - computer wins it'll return negative one
02:15 - else it it's going to be a tie and turn
02:18 - zero these numbers we return will help
02:20 - us keep track of who won that round then
02:24 - we're going to have the number War
02:25 - function with number of rounds and
02:27 - winning score player score will and
02:30 - score will start at zero then for the
02:32 - round number here we'll show the display
02:36 - the round and then here are the return
02:40 - values if round Z equals equals one then
02:44 - we're add one to player score if it's
02:46 - negative one which means the computer
02:47 - wins we're going to add one to the
02:49 - computer score and if it's zero we're
02:51 - not going to do anything cuz it was a
02:52 - tie then it'll show the your score and
02:55 - the computer score after every
02:57 - round then if players score is equal to
03:00 - winning score or the computer has the
03:02 - winning score will break and then if the
03:05 - player score is more than computer score
03:08 - it congratulations you win the game if
03:10 - the computer wins it'll say sorry
03:13 - computer wins the game else it's going
03:15 - to be a tie then the total number of
03:17 - rounds is five and the winning score is
03:19 - three but you can always adjust it then
03:22 - here we start the game so now we're
03:24 - going to put in Visual Studio codes with
03:26 - the code here we're going to run it okay
03:28 - do you want to play first play first
03:30 - okay so choose number between one and 10
03:32 - do five your final number was seven so
03:36 - the random offset was two so we added
03:38 - two then computer's number was nine so
03:40 - computer wins this round okay four then
03:44 - it added three and the computer's number
03:46 - was one so you win this round okay round
03:50 - three which number should I choose um
03:55 - seven oh it was tie so I got plus two
03:59 - and and the computer also got nine so
04:01 - round four three in valid Choice the F
04:05 - numbers out of range so it probably did
04:07 - -3 which is zero which is out of the
04:11 - range
04:13 - six the computer won this round because
04:16 - I got three that's my final number so
04:18 - round five okay let's choose a
04:23 - nine again I got plus three or plus two
04:28 - and then out of range do six so computer
04:32 - won my round because my final number is
04:34 - three so the computer won okay your turn
04:37 - you lost okay um
04:41 - six yes so I won cuz it was six against
04:46 - four
04:48 - four it was a tie so I got minus one
04:53 - eight it's also a
04:57 - tie um nine let's
05:01 - see oh oh y I win okay then round five
05:08 - if I win this round then I win you
05:10 - basically win already cuz you got a
05:12 - score
05:14 - oh I won per phone number was two
05:19 - computer won the r but it was 2 one okay

05:52 - eight okay so you got also got 10 and
05:55 - then computer got six so here the 10
