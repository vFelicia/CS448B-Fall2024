00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew
00:04 - today we're going to teach you python so
00:06 - today we're going to learn about
00:07 - inheritance
00:09 - in python so first we have a class so a
00:11 - class is basically a blueprint for
00:13 - objects so first we have a class called
00:16 - vehicle
00:18 - then we're going to death which is
00:19 - defined move cells this is a function
00:21 - or a method so vehicle can move
00:25 - so print when you do the function move
00:28 - it will print moves 10 miles
00:30 - then we're going to define another
00:32 - function method called recharge
00:34 - and then it'll print print gains 10
00:36 - gallons of gas so it can like
00:38 - refill its gas so we need inherent so we
00:41 - don't need to like
00:42 - copy and paste all the methods of one
00:45 - class
00:46 - to another class so we can just like
00:48 - inherit it and we don't need a copy and
00:50 - paste
00:51 - we okay then we can do class truck so we
00:54 - did vehicle over here to inherit
00:56 - so a truck can also move and recharge
01:00 - so it also adds its load because of the
01:03 - truck
01:04 - so print loads 100 boxes
01:08 - then we're going to do class ambulance
01:11 - then it also inherits vehicle
01:13 - then it'll define flash so ambulance
01:15 - have lights or
01:16 - print flashes lights then it'll define
01:19 - move self so it also has a move printer
01:22 - moves
01:23 - 50 miles so it also has a move and it
01:26 - hurts
01:27 - the class vehicle and it also hasn't
01:30 - moved so
01:31 - we'll print 10 or 50. so print
01:34 - 50 because we can override it so you can
01:36 - like
01:37 - upgrade is 10 miles to 50 miles
01:41 - then we're going to do classifier truck
01:43 - so it can inherit both
01:47 - well it can inherit two classes so it
01:50 - hurts truck and ambience
01:51 - which also it hurts from vehicles so it
01:54 - basically and hurts all these free
01:56 - classes
01:57 - so then it can splash because this fire
01:59 - truck to put out the fire it splashes
02:02 - water
02:03 - and it can override again so it has a
02:06 - move
02:06 - which is print 70 miles instead of the
02:09 - ambulance
02:09 - 50 miles which also overrided the
02:12 - vehicle's
02:13 - 10 miles then do
02:17 - car one equals ambience yeah okay so
02:20 - vehicles
02:21 - is the parent of the trucking ambulance
02:23 - and the truck and ambulance
02:26 - are the parents of the fire truck so it
02:30 - hurts is traits
02:31 - so then we have car one which is
02:33 - variable equals ambulance
02:35 - then a car one dot move and car when
02:37 - that flash don't receive it
02:39 - all right so it did moves 50 miles
02:43 - so it overrided the vehicles 10 miles
02:45 - and then
02:46 - it flashes lights i'm gonna do
02:50 - car one equals fire truck net they're
02:52 - gonna do car one dot splash
02:55 - so it can splash which is
02:58 - its own trade and it can move
03:01 - which is 70 miles overrided the
03:03 - ambulance 50 miles
03:05 - then it can do flash which is from also
03:08 - from the ambulance
03:09 - and it can load from the truck
03:13 - [Music]
03:15 - so it did splashes water
03:19 - from itself then it can move sunny miles
03:22 - so it override
03:23 - did the ambulance 50 miles because it
03:26 - has a move of 70 miles and flashes
03:29 - lights
03:30 - from the ambulance and loads 100 boxes
03:33 - from the truck
03:34 - so this isn't hurts well that was fun
03:38 - and that's it for today thank you for
03:40 - watching
03:41 - remember to smash the like button and
03:43 - subscribe bye bye
