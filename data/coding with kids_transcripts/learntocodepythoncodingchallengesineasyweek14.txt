00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Edison so edible is a coding platform
00:08 - where there are lots of coding problems
00:10 - to solve and you can solve the problems
00:13 - using different kinds of coding
00:15 - languages So today we're going to do
00:18 - three easy coding challenges with python
00:20 - so our first problem is called
00:23 - recreating the ABS function the ads
00:25 - function Returns the absolute value of a
00:27 - number this means it Returns the numbers
00:29 - positive value you can think of it as
00:32 - the distance away from zero
00:34 - create a function that recreates this
00:37 - functionality
00:38 - so for example here's what the as
00:40 - function does now it will turn negative
00:43 - five into five so like remove the
00:45 - negative assign if it doesn't have a
00:48 - negative sign it's just going to return
00:50 - the same number here 250 and we'll
00:54 - return to 50. if you give it negative
00:57 - 3.14 it will give you 3.14 without the
01:00 - negative sign okay so here we really
01:03 - have a simple solution so we're not
01:06 - going to go into deep here we're going
01:08 - to learn how to do modules so modules
01:10 - are like add-ons with more commands so
01:13 - we're going to add an import a module
01:15 - called math so you just type import math
01:18 - and then you do deaf absolute and so
01:21 - this is our function to define absolute
01:24 - with the variable n which is the number
01:25 - and then absolute value equals math.fabs
01:29 - and so Fabs is a function in the math
01:31 - module that does the exact same thing as
01:34 - the absolute function so we can just
01:36 - substitute it and then we're basically
01:39 - going to return the absolute value so
01:41 - there are modules for lots of things and
01:43 - models can be very useful so now see the
01:46 - test cases there is
01:49 - zero so we're just gonna get zero and uh
01:54 - yeah they're only two negative numbers
01:56 - negative five and negative 3.14 okay so
01:59 - we pass all the tests onto our next
02:01 - coding challenge so our next coding
02:03 - challenge is called Century crisis
02:06 - scientists have discovered that in four
02:08 - decades the world will explode it will
02:10 - also take three decades to make a
02:12 - spaceship to travel to a new plant that
02:14 - can hold the entire world population
02:17 - you must calculate the number of fuel
02:19 - there will be in three decades from now
02:21 - the variable p is the world population
02:23 - now assume that every month someone
02:26 - gives birth to more people which is the
02:27 - variable NP returned a number of people
02:30 - there will be when the spaceship is
02:31 - complete so here there is the current
02:34 - population and then the number of people
02:36 - that are born every month
02:39 - so first we have two variables P which
02:42 - is the current population and NP which
02:44 - is uh the number of people that are born
02:46 - every month so first we're going to do
02:49 - new people equals NP times 360. so we
02:52 - multiply it by 360 because in a decade
02:55 - there are 120 months so this will so 360
03:00 - is the months
03:02 - so now that we have the number of new
03:05 - people when you add it to the current
03:07 - population so we're going to do new
03:09 - people plus P which is the variable
03:12 - people and finally we're just going to
03:14 - return the variable people so now let's
03:16 - see the test cases there's
03:19 - 5240 which is current population three
03:22 - people are born every month that's still
03:24 - over that's still over a thousand people
03:27 - born in three decades okay so we pass
03:30 - all our tests onto our final coding
03:32 - challenge
03:33 - it's called football points create a
03:36 - function that takes the number of wins
03:37 - draws and losses and calculates the
03:39 - number of points a football team has
03:42 - obtained so far wins get three points
03:44 - draws get one point losses get zero
03:46 - points
03:47 - so here's three wins four draws and two
03:51 - losses so we basically have
03:54 - three times three equals nine nine plus
03:57 - four equals 13 points okay
04:00 - so we have three variables wins draws
04:03 - and losses we calculate the points first
04:05 - so we're going to do W points equals
04:08 - wins times three draw points equals
04:11 - draws times one and L points equals
04:14 - losses times zero
04:16 - uh so these are the points now now we
04:18 - add them all up for the total amount of
04:20 - points in the variable so the points we
04:22 - return that variable now let's check it
04:25 - and see it test cases there's zero when
04:28 - seven draws and zero losses that's kind
04:31 - of Lucky and unlucky and there's the
04:34 - zero wins zero draws in 15.
04:38 - that's just that yeah okay well we
04:42 - passed all our tests well that was fun
04:45 - and that's it for today thank you for
04:47 - watching Remember to smash like button
04:50 - and subscribe bye bye
