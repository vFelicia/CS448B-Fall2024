00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is today i'm learning
00:05 - minecraft education edition so as you
00:07 - can see we're in the nether because
00:09 - we're going to do some pickling training
00:11 - so on chat command piglet
00:14 - i'm going to use the builder teleport to
00:16 - where you are so the builder is
00:18 - basically an invisible agent suited for
00:22 - building and then we just call builder
00:24 - yeah so we also are going to use the
00:26 - agent so both the builder and agent are
00:29 - going to go to
00:30 - so agent's going to set blocker items so
00:33 - the agent is going to get
00:35 - 64 golden ingots in slot 1 so the agent
00:38 - also has an inventory so we're going to
00:41 - be using these golden ingots to trade
00:43 - with the piglets since pickling like um
00:46 - golden ingots so yeah yeah so agent said
00:50 - i active slot one then agent dot move
00:54 - agent move right by one and then
00:57 - now we're going to use the builder so
00:59 - repeat five times for the like cage
01:02 - where you'll get the piglet you don't
01:03 - want them running all around it's going
01:06 - to be hard to trade with them yeah so
01:07 - build our trace path for mark with so
01:10 - it's a fence and builder move forward by
01:13 - four that'll be one side then build a
01:15 - turn left for then get ready for another
01:18 - side so it'll make the cage so now let's
01:20 - test it out and see what loot
01:23 - we can't get
01:25 - but first let's see and type
01:28 - okay so death on the chats is a function
01:31 - brother dot teleport to position zero
01:33 - zero zero which is where you are yeah
01:36 - then agent dot teleport to player so the
01:38 - agent will also come the agent that set
01:41 - item gold and get 64 gold and gets in
01:44 - slot one agenda set slot one so this
01:47 - active slot is one and agent dot move
01:50 - right one so it won't be in the cage
01:53 - or stuck in the fence or else we have to
01:56 - like
01:57 - very hard try to get it out yeah so for
02:00 - index and range five so it's a repeat
02:02 - loop build in that trace path oak fence
02:05 - so builder that move forward four so
02:07 - there'll be one side and then builder
02:09 - the turn left turn get ready for another
02:12 - side and then it'll build the cage so
02:14 - player that on chat when you take
