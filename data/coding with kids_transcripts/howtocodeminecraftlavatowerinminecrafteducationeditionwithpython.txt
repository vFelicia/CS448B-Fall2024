00:00 - welcome to puddin with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia my name is andrew today we're a
00:04 - minecraft education edition and we're
00:06 - going to do the tutorial in microsoft
00:09 - make code
00:12 - so we're going to do
00:17 - lava tower
00:20 - make a lava flow down from the sky look
00:22 - at when it gets close so right now we
00:24 - see like an image of
00:26 - it's all of us floating there be careful
00:28 - so you don't get like
00:30 - burned by the lava except if you're in
00:33 - creative mode
00:34 - hey let's try something dramatic this
00:36 - tab tutorial makes a lava tower it stole
00:40 - his descent from the sky and then our
00:42 - command
00:43 - waits for it to flow to the ground you
00:45 - can then add some water to cool the lava
00:49 - you're going to use a paws loop to add
00:51 - some wait time and let the lava reach
00:53 - the ground before cooling it down so
00:55 - right now we see a lot of um stone
00:58 - towers then here water and leaking onto
01:01 - lava those are stone towers because like
01:04 - when the water goes on the lava it'll
01:06 - make it into stone so it's basically so
01:08 - after like this it will become one of
01:11 - those yeah
01:12 - okay put in and on chat command and
01:16 - rename it tower so
01:19 - do this on chat command tower
01:22 - using place put a lava block in the sky
01:25 - 20 blocks above you so block
01:28 - place
01:30 - lava
01:33 - 5
01:35 - then 20.
01:37 - so it'll be 20 bucks above you because
01:39 - you don't want the lava to be right
01:41 - where you are you'll get burned yeah use
01:44 - another place to add some water to cool
01:46 - the flowing law
01:49 - we want to make sure the lava has time
01:51 - to flow all the way to the ground before
01:53 - the water reaches it
01:55 - so make the water
01:57 - up appear very high in the sky 135
02:00 - five blocks above you so we're gonna go
02:03 - to box
02:04 - i'm gonna try to talk water right there
02:07 - and we need 5 105
02:11 - 5
02:12 - 135
02:15 - so spawn above the lawn okay get rid of
02:18 - the water use a pause of 1000
02:20 - milliseconds add a place with
02:23 - air to dry the water
02:26 - you do after
02:28 - do pause
02:30 - policy yeah pause
02:32 - 1000 milli seconds
02:35 - [Music]
02:37 - done
02:40 - yeah place
02:42 - air
02:44 - five
02:48 - okay
02:50 - go to minecraft type teach
02:52 - open the chat and enter town don't move
02:55 - though lava water and air need to fall
02:57 - from the sky at the same position near
02:59 - you it will take some time for the lava
03:02 - to cool and for the water to dry be but
03:05 - be careful lava can be destructive okay
03:08 - now i'm going to stay in the platform
03:15 - so death on on chats chance doesn't
03:17 - function black stop place lava pushes in
03:20 - twenty
03:21 - five twenty zero then it'll place water
03:24 - above the lava then it'll pause for a
03:27 - thousand milliseconds then it'll block
03:29 - stop place air at where the water is and
03:32 - then play that on chat tower and you
03:34 - touch tower in the chat it'll run the
03:36 - function
03:38 - [Music]
03:41 - so we need to type tower
03:45 - and don't move listen don't move
03:47 - [Music]
03:50 - okay i can see the water
03:52 - the water is actually pretty pretty hot
03:55 - and the water is pretty fast too
03:57 - [Music]
04:07 - gets gets into the lava it survives no
04:10 - matter what yeah the watercolor
04:13 - i don't think the um
04:15 - yeah it's not coming stone it's not
04:17 - going to reach the ground
04:20 - oh it reached the ground
04:22 - wow
04:23 - okay let's see what
04:24 - is is the water drying
04:28 - yeah yeah it's just peeling
04:30 - then
04:31 - here there will be nothing until the
04:33 - lava and then it'll be a stone top
04:36 - when you wait wait wait
04:39 - the water flow into the big lake well
04:42 - the swamp chicken and
04:44 - sheep are going for shape poor shape
04:47 - i'll say poor sheep
04:49 - chicken escaped they both look good
04:52 - now it's a clean tower stone and it's
04:55 - still cleaning those walls because um
04:57 - after the root first source of the water
05:00 - all the other water will just disappear
05:03 - like evaporate
05:05 - now let's switch the water with the lava
05:08 - and the lava with the water in the code
05:11 - so
05:13 - back to the box we're gonna
05:15 - see what happens if we change the lava
05:18 - to water and the water to lava
05:26 - [Music]
05:34 - now the water is coming down oh it's
05:36 - gonna be very fast
05:39 - get off the ground
05:42 - you can barely see it the lava is gonna
05:44 - be very very slow i think we should
05:46 - change to 135 to do this because the the
05:51 - water stopped the water stopped
05:55 - excuse me mr lava how long are you gonna
05:58 - is it still one block
06:00 - yeah let's do one walk
06:02 - i don't think it's gonna ever float down
06:07 - just one flat piece of block
06:09 - oh it's going down it's going down but
06:11 - you can't see the other
06:13 - oh because the air block because the air
06:16 - block the air block is faster than the
06:18 - lava so it's evaporating
06:22 - the lava
06:28 - we should stay the air position and
06:31 - change the lava position so it'll like
06:35 - change the 135 to
06:38 - 50. don't give it more time this to
06:42 - let's find my box 140.
06:46 - okay now let's try again
06:50 - [Music]
06:54 - i hate those holes in minecraft
06:57 - just splashing through them if you're
06:59 - not looking away
07:01 - [Music]
07:27 - [Music]
07:28 - okay let's go on fire
07:31 - okay i don't want to
07:34 - what
07:35 - we're on fire
07:39 - oops
07:40 - water okay close
07:43 - okay let's wait look at the other lava
07:46 - right there only
07:49 - okay he's almost reached it
07:54 - and then the whole wall up here because
07:56 - that was a source block oh yeah
07:58 - so immediately destroyed the whole water
08:02 - that's what it does now there's
08:04 - there's a lava oh no now the lava is
08:06 - gonna go on the ground
08:08 - no it's not gonna reach the water
08:12 - now all the water's drying
08:14 - no more water disappear
08:16 - oh no what do we do level's gonna spread
08:19 - everywhere
08:24 - okay what does it do okay it just
08:26 - spreads around
08:28 - spreads around
08:31 - uh we need a place block to stop the
08:32 - blah blah i'll make a hole
08:35 - i made a hole
08:37 - okay they're smart enough to make a hole
08:39 - that you think you know these blocks no
08:43 - where's the air block i want to see the
08:44 - air block
08:45 - [Music]
08:46 - still it doesn't didn't reach it yet
08:49 - you see it's 140 blocks high don't think
09:00 - let's go go into the lava
09:03 - are you dropping down yeah
09:06 - i don't know it's all red
09:08 - we
09:09 - dropped very slow i think
09:12 - yeah because lava was slow
09:18 - maybe if you're in survival mode you
09:20 - find like a lava and night when you
09:23 - don't have torch it might be a good
09:25 - source of plant but be careful for
09:29 - burning yourself and then
