00:00 - welcome to creating with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:04 - in minecraft education edition and we're
00:06 - going to do
00:07 - on this tutorial so we're going to do
00:12 - builder wall
00:16 - so this is as the builder movement
00:20 - advance we want to leave new books
00:24 - set trace path for the builder and use
00:27 - mossy stone grips for blocks
00:30 - so let's go look at these fans and
00:35 - builder chase pack from mark
00:38 - with a stop
00:42 - mask stone block
00:45 - right here
00:51 - then we need to add builder move forward
00:55 - before the bill trace pass markless
00:59 - so like i'll make 20
01:02 - yeah right we'll fall back 20
01:06 - [Music]
01:08 - then build a place mark
01:14 - and doesn't move left by five
01:30 - now we're building the wall yeah then
01:33 - after
01:33 - builder placement we need a builder move
01:36 - forward by 20
01:38 - so we have this here then build and move
01:41 - up by one
01:45 - up by one then turn
01:48 - builder turn left and
01:52 - yeah left left
01:57 - then build a stone wall that is 10 rows
02:01 - high by putting the builder movement
02:03 - action into a loop so we're going to
02:05 - repeat 10 times after the builder
02:06 - replacement
02:07 - yeah so we need a loop repeat four times
02:11 - put
02:13 - the move forward and
02:16 - the other one's in
02:19 - repeat 10 times and then put back the
02:22 - repeat
02:25 - after it do build and move left by five
02:28 - and
02:28 - build a pace
02:48 - ah
03:03 - code and look up to see your new wall
03:05 - okay
03:06 - so before that let's add some to this
03:10 - so i'll check a minute when we press
03:14 - wall then it will run this code
03:17 - and forever
03:22 - [Music]
03:25 - agent teleport to player so when we're
03:28 - in the right place we'll
03:29 - press wall then
03:32 - because the agent is always following
03:34 - you when you're in the right space and
03:36 - the agent is the right space
03:38 - you do it so let's first see python
03:41 - so def honor chat so builder that moved
03:45 - left so the
03:46 - builder will move left five times now
03:48 - build through that mark so it'll make
03:49 - mark then for index and range 10 so it
03:52 - will repeat 10 times
03:54 - builder that move forward 20 times
03:57 - bit that move up one time another turn
04:01 - left turn two times and then builder
04:03 - that trace
04:04 - path mostly stone bricks build that
04:06 - place
04:08 - air and then player on that on chat
04:11 - wall on one chat so when you type wall
04:14 - run the function
04:15 - then def on forever no agent dot
04:18 - teleport to player then lose stuff
04:20 - forever on forever so that's a repeat
04:22 - loop
04:22 - so first let's see where should i make
04:24 - the wall
04:26 - we're
04:40 - the agent keeps still applying to us
04:43 - that's a pretty
04:44 - good one yeah it's like you can't do
04:46 - this code to defend
04:47 - your kind of city or town from invaders
04:52 - okay now andrew's turn where do you
04:55 - choose oh there's a bee nest over there
04:57 - i'll
04:58 - build it into in the lake
05:03 - go into the lakes
05:22 - so you can block some water yeah uh the
05:25 - agent is following us
05:27 - up one last time when you try to do it
05:31 - it's gonna be wrong
05:35 - oh it's right there
05:42 - maybe it's up there oh is
05:45 - this one is it super close i thought
05:49 - this one the one we just created was in
05:52 - the
05:52 - yeah water so that's very confusing
05:55 - yeah pumpkin pumpkin let's make one
05:59 - final wall
06:01 - somewhere near the pumpkin yeah
06:09 - [Music]
06:17 - oh the agent isn't teleporting to us
06:21 - it made another wall over here so now
06:23 - there are three walls
06:25 - jumpers if you have super super jump you
06:28 - can jump
06:28 - over here oh yeah i don't think you can
06:32 - jump over here to the other
06:34 - wall if you were in survival mode you
06:37 - will die
