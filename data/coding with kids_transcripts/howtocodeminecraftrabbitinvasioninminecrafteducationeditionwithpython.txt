00:00 - welcome to recording with kids my name
00:03 - is andrew today we're in microsoft
00:05 - education edition and we're going to
00:08 - make a project which is called rabbit
00:10 - invasion so kalia changed it kind of
00:14 - like changed it so you don't have to
00:16 - kill a rabbit so originally it was one
00:19 - of just four tutorials but clearly like
00:22 - changed
00:24 - so like if you put a bed and then there
00:26 - will be maybe rats yeah instead of um
00:29 - killing rabbit to make two more spawn
00:33 - so first
00:34 - i'm gonna do when
00:38 - so on
00:41 - your bed place good
00:45 - so when you like want to go to sleep
00:47 - yeah it doesn't matter which color
00:50 - then
00:51 - you need to do a set
00:55 - i mean we need to make a variable first
00:57 - call rabbit because when you like um
00:59 - keep track of the rabbits like
01:02 - yeah
01:03 - then
01:05 - random so we're going to set the um
01:09 - pick
01:10 - random and we the variable set rabbit
01:14 - two so we're going to pick random from
01:16 - zero to five so it might spawn zero
01:19 - rabbits
01:20 - or one two three four five
01:23 - then
01:26 - so we
01:27 - if the um thermal rabbit is
01:32 - zero then you don't do anything
01:35 - so if
01:38 - rabbit equals two
01:46 - so rabbit has a value yeah so we're
01:50 - gonna keep track how many rounds there
01:52 - are so if there are
01:55 - zero then you do nothing
01:58 - then if rabbit equals one because it
02:00 - chooses normal like random then you need
02:03 - a spawn a rabbit
02:05 - so so here like after we pick how many
02:09 - rabbits
02:10 - um
02:10 - it's gonna spawn we're gonna spawn
02:14 - so rabbit
02:16 - and then
02:17 - you keep like one two three four five
02:21 - but we need a repeat loop
02:23 - and hopefully
02:25 - here repeat
02:28 - two times
02:30 - so we spawn two rabbits and then three
02:32 - four five you can spawn like hostile
02:35 - mobs
02:36 - if you want but right here we're doing
02:38 - rabbits
02:39 - so we you can search monster because the
02:42 - spawn animal only spawns
02:44 - uh mobs that are not hostile
02:48 - so all you have to do to change these
02:50 - spawn rabbits is change the
02:54 - rabbit equals so you can change four or
02:56 - five
02:58 - stuff and you just change the repeat
03:01 - number so you can do like 10 but that
03:03 - will be adding a lot of code 100 is too
03:06 - insane i would think it's
03:08 - really the same code yeah so let's read
03:11 - the code in python
03:14 - okay so rabbit equals zero so this is
03:16 - the variable so right now it starts as
03:19 - value as zero so there's zero rounds so
03:22 - define shows a function on block place
03:24 - the bed global rad so we can use the
03:27 - interval rabbit everywhere the rabbit
03:29 - moves around
03:46 - where you are so it's position zero zero
03:48 - zero so spawn one then rabbit equals two
03:52 - and four index and range two so we'll
03:53 - spawn two rabbits then it'll be the same
03:56 - four
03:57 - with rabbit equals three if gravity
03:58 - equals four and if rabbit equals five
04:01 - and then block stop unblock placed bet
04:04 - so when you place the bed it'll run the
04:06 - function
04:07 - okay
04:08 - now
04:09 - let's get a bed
04:12 - which color should be yet blue light
04:15 - blue light cyan or cyan uh light blue
04:19 - white blue okay
04:21 - okay that's right okay
04:24 - now i'm gonna place it
04:26 - i guess it only allows white bed
04:29 - or maybe that it dudes zero
04:31 - okay let's do it again
04:33 - guess it only allows white to bed
04:36 - it's gonna do like that
04:42 - one of them is a baby this one's a baby
04:45 - oh it's three it's three one black two
04:48 - little brown okay next
04:51 - oh two two so they spawn all at the same
04:54 - time so at first when you look down
04:56 - they're all at the same spot
05:00 - yeah but then when they start moving you
05:01 - can see
05:03 - this time
05:04 - four
05:05 - no five that's the highs and three of
05:08 - them are big so cute
05:10 - okay should we change it rabbits to um
05:13 - well that was fun so if we change
05:16 - rabbits into
05:17 - what should we change it oh zombies
05:20 - zombies yeah
05:22 - okay
05:23 - let's do it
05:24 - but we need to change a lot of things
05:27 - but it's okay yeah okay so monsters
05:29 - we're gonna do monsters
05:32 - here okay if
05:34 - so
05:36 - monster
05:38 - let's do zombies and we're just gonna
05:41 - duplicate it
05:42 - so we get a lot
05:45 - so we just need to change the um spawn
05:49 - yeah
05:51 - if you're in survival mode this will be
05:52 - a little bit insane because every time
05:54 - you want to go to sleep then some
05:56 - style moms yeah but you can't sleep on
05:59 - hostile malls like zombies
06:01 - okay
06:04 - okay
06:05 - get ready
06:07 - they're burning
06:09 - oh spit me tonight
06:12 - no
06:14 - maybe we'll spawn some lucky zombies
06:16 - with help
06:17 - i don't think so now they're all burning
06:20 - all over the place and they're
06:22 - oh they're heading to a pound you lucky
06:24 - one these smart ones oh we got zero wait
06:27 - why aren't they going to the pound
06:31 - before they die
06:32 - yeah that one's smart this one go go go
06:35 - oh no
06:37 - that one also
06:40 - oh that one's a pro
06:43 - oh this one's not gone
06:46 - they're still getting damaged because
06:47 - every time they jump
06:51 - now these ones are safe because they
06:52 - spawned
06:53 - in there i want them to change into a
06:55 - drown
06:57 - when your weight
06:59 - oh it's a baby one
07:12 - i want to get a drown
07:15 - you just need to wait
07:19 - keep jumping around
07:21 - most of them will just get burnt let's
07:24 - uh do another one
07:26 - what should we do creepers
07:28 - yes
07:43 - if you're like so um thing like the
07:45 - variable doesn't match that you might
07:48 - want to change it but
07:51 - do you
07:56 - let's
08:08 - oh
08:09 - it just exploded the other creepers how
08:12 - sad
08:14 - okay
08:15 - let's do it

08:38 - to the florida but the other one
08:41 - all right
08:42 - oh it's the next one let's see how far
08:44 - now we can explode trees
08:47 - which is more friendly
08:50 - oh we got one
08:52 - boom logistics will be part of it
08:58 - it's
09:00 - on right on top of the bullet that okay
