00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kia and my name is Andrew today we're
00:04 - going to make a mad lips game with
00:06 - Chachi BT and Pyon so Madness is a
00:09 - placeholder game where that you have a
00:11 - story and then there are these blanks in
00:13 - it and you can um put random words in it
00:16 - to make a funny story so I asked chb to
00:20 - create a Mad Libs game in Python and
00:23 - then I asked it to expand the on the
00:25 - story to make it longer so here's the
00:27 - story and then there was some bugs like
00:30 - not all the placeholders were filled so
00:32 - now I fixed it with Chach gbt and now
00:35 - it's good so first we have a function
00:38 - called mad lives and we have story
00:40 - template with placeholders as you can
00:42 - see there is a story and then there are
00:44 - these blanks like adjective place and
00:47 - then verb and adverb so we can fill
00:49 - these blank holders out by inputting
00:52 - variables into in the while running the
00:56 - code so we're then we're going to ask
00:58 - the person for words to fill in the
01:00 - placeholders we're going to do words
01:02 - equals and then here we're going to have
01:04 - all these and we're going to do input
01:07 - enter objective Place person Etc here
01:10 - we're going to insert all our words then
01:12 - we're going to do fi story equals story
01:15 - and then for each placeholder for each
01:17 - blank in there so these words will also
01:20 - repeat it'll insert all the words we
01:23 - entered into the story then here it'll
01:25 - hold the um completed story then it'll
01:28 - print your mad live story and then it'll
