00:11 - in
00:12 - his project animal race
00:15 - so this is my project animal race and
00:18 - it's a
00:18 - two player game and it's it's very
00:22 - simple
00:22 - and you the goal is to race
00:26 - by pressing the m and a buttons and your
00:29 - characters are these two and you're
00:30 - trying to get the balloons
00:32 - so let's show you how it's done
00:39 - who's pressing you know like
00:43 - who am i controlling oh you won
00:46 - m is the blue dog yeah so
00:50 - so let's go to the code so first the
00:52 - scratch cat here so it does very little
00:54 - things
00:55 - but it's still part of the project so
00:57 - when green flat clicked that means when
00:59 - you run it
00:59 - it'll set the variable count to zero so
01:02 - like is the countdown until the race
01:04 - begins
01:05 - so like to add more
01:08 - to add more excitement into the project
01:11 - then it'll repeat three times
01:13 - that means it'll keep repeating whatever
01:15 - is in the loop
01:16 - three times that it will change count by
01:19 - one and then
01:19 - say count for one second so i'll be like
01:23 - so count will be zero right it will
01:26 - change count by one which will add
01:28 - one to counts over one
01:31 - two three and then it'll say go
01:35 - and then it'll broadcast start race
01:37 - which is um a message
01:39 - and then the you can start moving the
01:42 - dog and the space dog
01:46 - and also when green flag clicked it will
01:48 - forever place on dance magic
01:50 - and i reversed it and made it softer so
01:54 - it also plays music so in the dog
01:57 - i'll call it a blue dog because it's not
02:00 - like a usual dog it looks like a sick
02:02 - dog when green flag clicked it will go
02:06 - to dog start
02:07 - which is right where the x is the
02:11 - expert is called dog start and then why
02:13 - don't you just
02:14 - hide them no whenever c
02:17 - start race that's the message the
02:20 - scratch cat
02:21 - stands after says go oh forever wait
02:24 - until
02:25 - key m press so you press m to move the
02:28 - blue dog
02:29 - and then wait until not key and pressed
02:32 - then move 10 steps next costume so
02:36 - as i walk in costume and then if
02:38 - touching the dog finish which is the
02:40 - blue balloon is called dog finish and
02:42 - then we'll switch
02:43 - backdrop to player one win with the
02:45 - worst
02:47 - p1 wins that means player one and
02:50 - they'll stop
02:50 - all the things and the project will stop
02:53 - and then the dog start
02:55 - and it has no code yet you just put it
02:58 - here
02:59 - dog finish no code that means bat
03:02 - finishing
03:03 - start has no code well it was originally
03:06 - a bad but i changed it to space dog
03:10 - so when green flag clicked for the space
03:12 - dog it'll switch back up to blue
03:14 - sky which is this black drop
03:18 - and then it will go to batch dot which
03:20 - is this
03:22 - the arrow and then it'll go to the front
03:25 - layer
03:26 - and then when i receive start race
03:28 - scratch cast sends
03:29 - forever wait until key a press so you
03:32 - use
03:32 - the a key to move the space star and
03:35 - then wait until
03:36 - not key a pressed move 10 steps next
03:39 - costume
03:40 - well it doesn't have cost only has one
03:42 - costume
03:43 - yeah so it's just staying then if
03:45 - touching the bat finish which is the
03:47 - yellow balloon and then it'll switch
03:50 - back up to p
03:51 - to when i use player two then stop
03:54 - all so it'll also stop everything so in
03:57 - the backdrops
03:59 - there's no code and there's two yes
04:02 - so i colored these by myself and i typed
04:06 - these with
04:07 - these tools and i like changed their
04:09 - colors
04:10 - and into pixel font
04:13 - so player two is green and player one
04:17 - is red so this is a blue sky backdrop
04:20 - and that's it three
04:24 - one two three i'm a
04:40 - let's
04:54 - last time three two one
05:08 - clear one wins clear wins no
05:12 - and you take up on the keys
05:15 - on the key your finger needs to be
05:18 - verified
05:20 - what's my finger isn't really so i got
05:23 - all these sprites
05:24 - from the scratch collection of sprites
05:27 - so you
