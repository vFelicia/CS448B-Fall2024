00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:06 - python today we're going to learn about
00:08 - function keywords so first we're going
00:09 - to do def
00:10 - print keyword r so we're defining a
00:12 - function called print keyword
00:14 - args then star star quarks which is
00:17 - known
00:18 - arguments or named arguments don't print
00:20 - dash
00:21 - and which is new line then we'll do
00:23 - third which is a variable equals quartz
00:26 - so you can type the keys and values
00:29 - dot get third none so if you type like
00:32 - third equals n you'll get your key third
00:36 - and then if third equals not none
00:40 - that means if it has a value it will
00:42 - print
00:43 - third arc equals then your value then
00:46 - we'll do
00:46 - four statements so for each key and
00:49 - value
00:50 - in quarks.item so for each key and value
00:53 - type
00:53 - it'll print f string key equals val so
00:56 - if you type first equals a it'll print
00:59 - first
01:00 - equals a finally we're going to
01:03 - print keyword arts first a so first is
01:06 - the key and
01:06 - a is the value so for the for statement
01:09 - it'll print
01:10 - first equals a and for this it'll do
01:13 - nothing because there's no first key
01:15 - then we'll do print keyword rs first
01:17 - equals b
01:18 - second equals c so it's like a b c yeah
01:22 - then print cable of r's first equals d
01:24 - second equals e and third equals
01:26 - f so the last time we call the function
01:29 - we have the third
01:31 - so it'll get the third and for has a
01:34 - value
01:34 - f so point four arc equals f
01:38 - so save it and run it so it did
01:42 - first equals a then
01:47 - then first equals b
01:50 - second equals c then first equals d
01:53 - second
01:53 - equals e third equals f and then for arg
01:57 - equals f next we'll do
02:01 - up here after the new line it'll print
02:03 - quark so it'll print like curly brackets
02:05 - and then
02:06 - first equals a then it will print the
02:08 - type of cost so save it
02:11 - and run it we're adding that code to
02:14 - like
02:14 - all right oh yeah so it did the same
02:17 - thing
02:18 - well did this first equals a is first
02:20 - you
02:22 - hit this first equals a and curly
02:24 - brackets
02:25 - is class stick which is dictionary and
02:27 - the first equals a again
02:29 - the first b for second and c in curly
02:32 - brackets
02:33 - and class dictionary again two then
02:36 - first equals b
02:37 - second equals c then first d second e
02:41 - third f then class dictionary and
02:45 - then first equals d second equals e
02:47 - third equals
02:48 - f and inferred arg equals f
02:51 - so it added the print quarks
02:55 - and that was fun and that's it for today
02:59 - thank you for watching remember to smash

03:03 - bye bye
