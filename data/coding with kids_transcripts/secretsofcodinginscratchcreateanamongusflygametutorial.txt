00:03 - my name is andrew today is scratch
00:06 - it and in andrews account techno468
00:09 - today i'm going to show you my project
00:11 - called a mangas fly
00:12 - so first we have a sprite called science
00:15 - so it's like flappy bird but it's
00:16 - different
00:17 - so when up arrow key press change y by
00:20 - 10
00:20 - okay so let's show you
00:26 - oh no dodge the buildings
00:32 - okay so now let's show you the code so
00:34 - when up arrow key press change y by 10
00:37 - so it'll go
00:38 - up and then you can also use space to go
00:40 - up
00:41 - and then when down arrow key press
00:43 - change y by negative 10 so you
00:45 - will go down so green flag collector
00:47 - will go to its start position which is
00:49 - like
00:49 - in the middle right here so one green
00:52 - flag clicked
00:53 - if key space press then
00:56 - else change y by negative 10 wait 0.2
01:00 - seconds and then when green flag collect
01:03 - it'll switch costume to sign because it
01:05 - also has
01:06 - a game over costume and then
01:10 - do set the variable coins position
01:13 - random score and lie to zero
01:15 - that will lie to free and then do
01:18 - when green flex oops clicked
01:23 - then forever if touching buildings
01:26 - that's the obstacle
01:27 - you'll change lives by negative one and
01:29 - then it will wait five seconds so it'll
01:31 - like won't change your lives like so
01:33 - fast then when green flags like that
01:36 - forever
01:36 - if loss equals zero that means when you
01:38 - like lose all your lives
01:40 - now switch causing to costume one which
01:42 - is the game over and stop all so to stop
01:44 - the game
01:45 - and also play good to be alive now the
01:48 - coin spices like a mario coin
01:50 - so when green flags click it'll hide and
01:53 - go to
01:54 - this position then for reflect clicked
01:57 - for
01:57 - forever if touching sign which is the
02:00 - player then i'll change coins by one
02:02 - and then change score by 150 so each
02:05 - coin is
02:06 - 150 score then i'll wait one second so
02:11 - it also won't add too much points then
02:14 - when green flag clicked
02:15 - it'll show now four set position random
02:18 - to pick when
02:19 - one two three so it's a variable then if
02:22 - position random equals one then go to
02:25 - start or call up so it's
02:27 - a sprite that is right here there's
02:30 - three of them
02:31 - for the start positions of the obstacles
02:34 - and the coins
02:35 - then wait 0.4 seconds and then repeat 4
02:38 - seconds
02:38 - change what x by negative 10 and wait
02:41 - one second so keep going for
02:43 - the player then if position random
02:45 - equals 2 then it'll go to the
02:47 - middle and it'll change y by
02:51 - change x by negative 10 i mean 100 and
02:54 - go forward the player again
02:55 - and wait one second so then in the
02:58 - buildings which is
02:59 - the sprite from scratch when green flags
03:02 - click so high so the buildings is the
03:04 - obstacle so in green flag clicked ill
03:07 - forever if touching sign
03:09 - then change score by negative 150 so l
03:12 - minus 150 and then wait three seconds so
03:15 - it also won't minus too much points
03:18 - then when green flag clicked it'll show
03:20 - so it's like basically
03:22 - the same code as the coin but it'll go
03:25 - to the middle and
03:26 - down it can't go up or it'll like block
03:28 - all
03:29 - everything and you'll like definitely
03:31 - lose life so
03:32 - there's up down and
03:36 - the middle so these are where like the
03:39 - starting of the obstacles and
03:41 - collectibles
03:42 - and then up the only collectibles which
03:45 - is the coins then
03:47 - down is only obstacles and the
03:50 - middle is for both of them so now let's
03:52 - play
03:53 - so omelettes here

04:30 - much easier because you don't even need
04:33 - to go down
04:34 - i've too far oh no the building went to
04:37 - the middle
04:38 - but the coins all almost always goes up
04:43 - we'll stay up let's see what if we what
