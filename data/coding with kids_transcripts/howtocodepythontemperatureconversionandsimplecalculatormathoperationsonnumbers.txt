00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew and today we're going to learn
00:05 - about python so we're going to learn
00:07 - about user input
00:08 - and performing mathematical operations
00:10 - so i have my file temp dot py
00:13 - and we're going to make a machine that
00:15 - turns fanta height to celsius
00:17 - so unless your fair height
00:22 - equals
00:28 - what
00:34 - [Music]
00:48 - so right now is the checking if the
00:51 - answer the user typed in to the question
00:54 - what is the temperature and fan height
00:56 - is the number if it's false so let's do
00:58 - two equals
01:00 - default so if it's false
01:20 - a question what is the temperature and
01:22 - fan right you can take the answer
01:24 - and then it will check if your answer is
01:27 - a number
01:28 - if it's not a number and it will print
01:31 - input is not a number and then
01:32 - exit so stop the code and you're going
01:34 - to run the code again
01:36 - next let's do the parent height
01:52 - is
01:57 - minus 32
02:06 - okay
02:17 - so 5 9 is a fraction
02:21 - and this is the formula for turning
02:23 - fahrenheit into celsius
02:26 - then let's do
02:46 - so we turn it into a string so we can
02:48 - print it and
02:50 - this print will print what
02:53 - your your temperature is in celsius so
02:56 - let's save it with control
02:57 - s and go to terminal and type
03:01 - pink y
03:05 - then press enter and what is the
03:07 - temperature
03:08 - outside 50
03:11 - okay then temperature in celsius is 10
03:14 - okay you can use the arrow to
03:23 - temperature in celsius is 148 okay last
03:27 - try
03:27 - let's run it again
03:33 - temperature and celsius is free
03:36 - okay now i have my second folder
03:40 - out simplecall.piva and i already have
03:42 - some code
03:43 - and now i'm going to build a simple
03:45 - calculator
03:47 - and we can use different operations okay
03:50 - so i already have some code as well
03:53 - right now the code will check the
03:55 - operation
03:56 - and it will give you the answer okay
04:00 - let's do print
04:04 - simple calculator
04:07 - so this is like the intro okay then
04:11 - first first
04:14 - number equals input so the user can type
04:19 - by answer
04:21 - okay then first
04:25 - number okay first number so
04:29 - it'll ask you for the first number you
04:31 - want to
04:32 - like perform a mathematical operation
04:34 - with
04:35 - then you can answer in an if
04:39 - first number
04:50 - function will check your if your first
04:53 - number is a number
04:54 - so equals
04:59 - false so if your answer is not a number
05:08 - then
05:10 - please input
05:14 - a number
05:17 - then
05:21 - so if your answer is not a number it
05:23 - will print please
05:24 - input a number and then exit we will
05:27 - stop all the code
05:28 - and you need one again next we're gonna
05:30 - do
05:36 - operations
05:46 - [Laughter]
06:04 - equals
06:10 - [Music]
06:16 - [Music]
06:19 - and then
06:24 - second number dot
06:32 - is
06:46 - then print
06:53 - import it is
06:57 - not um
07:08 - okay so the result is blank so
07:11 - we're calculating is operation equals
07:13 - plus
07:14 - so if you enter the plus at the when it
07:16 - asks for the operation
07:18 - it'll do it'll do this if operation
07:21 - equals plus result
07:22 - equals first number plus
07:25 - second number so it's calculating the
07:28 - result
07:29 - and then label equals sum
07:32 - and then l of operation equals minus
07:36 - then result equals first number
07:41 - minus second number
07:44 - just calculate again then
07:48 - if l of lf operation equals
07:52 - star that means multiplication result
07:54 - equals
07:56 - first number star so we're multiplying
08:02 - second number okay then label product
08:05 - so the label is the
08:09 - and the name of the answer in
08:13 - that operation then lf operation
08:16 - equals division that means
08:20 - forward slash then result equals first
08:23 - number
08:24 - four slash second number so we're
08:28 - dividing
08:29 - and then label equals quotient then
08:34 - upper if opera l of operation equals
08:37 - star star
08:38 - that means exponent so five
08:41 - so there's the power so
08:45 - two to the power of three that means
08:48 - you need to do two times two times two
08:53 - okay so that will be
08:57 - that will be eight okay let's do a
09:00 - result
09:01 - equals first number
09:05 - star star second number
09:09 - then lf operation equals percentage
09:12 - which is
09:13 - modulus the five model is four
09:16 - will be the leftover which is one
09:20 - because 4 can't
09:23 - add up to 5 or multiply up to 5
09:27 - because it just can't then result
09:30 - equals first number
09:37 - percentage second number
09:41 - then else print operation not recognized
09:43 - because you did
09:44 - none of these symbols
09:47 - then it will print operation not
09:49 - recognized except
09:52 - then we're going to do
09:56 - print play
10:00 - label
10:03 - plus then of
10:08 - spaces oops
10:13 - plus string
10:19 - first number so we can print it so
10:22 - that's why we're turning it
10:23 - first number into string then plus
10:28 - and empty so there's space between the
10:33 - words and numbers
10:37 - operation love
10:41 - empty space plus
10:44 - string second number
11:01 - space equals or space on both sides
11:06 - and then
11:21 - these three
11:28 - result so the last effect
11:32 - so print label of string first number so
11:36 - this print is printing the answer
11:40 - let's save it and try
11:43 - let's do py
11:46 - simple call that py
11:50 - and press enter simple calculator first
11:52 - number
11:53 - five operation let's do star
11:56 - so we're multiplying
12:00 - then second number 3
12:03 - then product of 5 star 3
12:06 - that means multiply equals 15 that's
12:09 - right
12:10 - let's type bomb now okay
12:14 - then first number three
12:18 - operation bulb
12:23 - then second number two
12:26 - then operation not recognized because
12:28 - after you type the second number
12:30 - and all your numbers and
12:34 - your second number is a number then it
12:36 - will
12:37 - just keep going on and it'll check your
12:40 - operation i type bob for the operation
12:42 - that's no the operations so it'll print
12:45 - operation not recognized
12:47 - let's do another one first number
12:51 - six operation let's do
12:54 - percentage so
12:57 - that is modulus then second number
13:00 - one then models of six percentage one
13:04 - that means models equals
13:06 - zero okay one more time
13:11 - first number let's do 30
13:15 - operation let's do plus
13:19 - second number 20
13:23 - sum of 30 plus 20 equals
13:26 - 50 and that's right thank you for
