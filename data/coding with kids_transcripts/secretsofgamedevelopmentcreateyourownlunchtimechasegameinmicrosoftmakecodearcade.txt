00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - cutting with kids my name is andrew
00:04 - today we're
00:05 - in microsoft make code arcade
00:09 - so today i'm going to show you my game
00:11 - lunchtime chase
00:13 - so as you see here i am a
00:16 - happy face i wasn't so good at drawing
00:19 - it
00:20 - and there's a pizza and timer and your
00:22 - score
00:23 - so first let's show you how this works
00:27 - so i'm gonna play it first
00:43 - the timer goes to three seconds
00:47 - okay now let's see the code so first on
00:50 - start so like
00:51 - when you run the the project set score
00:54 - to zero so
00:56 - the score is here and set background
00:58 - color to this color
01:00 - blue yeah and then set my sprite to
01:03 - sprite
01:03 - happy face so i choose the happy face
01:06 - see
01:07 - it's not so good of kind player so this
01:10 - the happy faces are player then move my
01:13 - sprite with
01:14 - buttons so we can move our happy face
01:18 - with the buttons like the arrow keys on
01:21 - your computer
01:22 - or these buttons okay which is harder
01:26 - yeah then set pizza to sprite
01:29 - of kind food so the pizza we're gonna
01:33 - try to
01:33 - touch the pizza and the pizza is a food
01:38 - because the pizza isn't food yeah it is
01:41 - the cat is a kind of player okay then
01:44 - on sprite of kind player over lots of
01:47 - sprite of kind
01:48 - food so our happy face is player and
01:52 - the pizza is food so this is basically
01:55 - if the happy face
01:56 - to just the pizza or the pizza touches
01:59 - the
02:00 - happy face then place down ppu so it's a
02:02 - sound
02:03 - it's like a scoring sound but they're
02:08 - is no scores so i picked the ppu
02:11 - then start countdown four seconds so
02:13 - there's a countdown for four seconds so
02:15 - it'll
02:17 - it'll count down for four seconds
02:20 - i tried other like five seconds or six
02:23 - seconds but they're
02:24 - like kind of made it easy so four
02:26 - seconds is like
02:27 - not too hard or not too easy so yeah
02:29 - it's the perfect one
02:30 - then change score by one and then set
02:33 - pizza positions to
02:35 - x pick random 1 to 160 and y
02:38 - 106 yeah 10 to 120 so speaking is
02:42 - random x and y coordinates so
02:45 - if the happy face touches the pizza then
02:48 - the pizza will go to a random
02:50 - position in the screen and
02:53 - when you start you always get one at
02:55 - least one point because
02:57 - the happy face and the pizza appear on
02:59 - the same place
03:00 - when you run the code
03:04 - and yeah that's all the code
03:07 - okay yeah i'm gonna go first
03:13 - sorry let's see if i can get at least
03:16 - 10.
03:29 - one time i got over 30 score
03:32 - yeah 46 i think okay let's change it to
03:35 - three oh no so i'm gonna play first
03:39 - and then leah's gonna play
03:44 - if the countdown goes to zero it will
03:47 - automatically stop the game
03:50 - and that's how this kind of work
03:53 - yeah automatically
03:56 - you lose okay 14. 15.
04:03 - 18 19 20 yeah
04:08 - sometimes you don't even need to move
04:10 - because
04:11 - the pizza goes on top of you yeah
04:13 - because it goes to one position
04:15 - 30. wow
