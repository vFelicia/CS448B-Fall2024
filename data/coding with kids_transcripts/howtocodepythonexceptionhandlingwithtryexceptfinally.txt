00:00 - welcome to recruiting with kids my name
00:02 - is andrew today we're going to teach you
00:05 - python today we're going to learn
00:07 - exception handling so
00:08 - first we're going to do result equals 0
00:10 - which is a variable then we're going to
00:12 - do try which is the code we're going to
00:13 - try to do
00:14 - so we're going to do num1 equals end
00:17 - input enter a number of cakes so
00:19 - we can type a number of cakes and then
00:22 - there's num2
00:23 - equals int input enter a number of
00:25 - people to share the cakes
00:27 - so you can enter numbers then we'll do
00:29 - result equals num1 slash
00:31 - num2 so slash is basically divide so
00:34 - we're going to divide num1 by num2
00:37 - we're going to do if num2 is less than 2
00:40 - we're going to raise
00:42 - value error so we're going to raise the
00:44 - error
00:45 - then we're going to do accept which is
00:47 - the the code will run
00:49 - if there is a error so we're going to
00:51 - accept
00:52 - print and valid input so we're going to
00:54 - save and try to enter a number of kicks
00:56 - i'm when we do four
00:58 - and then we'll do enter a number of
01:01 - people to share the kicks we're gonna do
01:03 - zero
01:03 - then it says invalid inputs because we
01:06 - had zero
01:07 - and numbers can't divide by zero
01:10 - so now we'll do else so
01:14 - which is the code will run if there is
01:17 - no error i'm gonna print each person can
01:20 - have result
01:21 - cakes so now we are gonna do
01:24 - i'm gonna do eight cakes then four
01:28 - people so it is each person can have
01:31 - two cakes so next we're gonna do finally
01:35 - print thanks for eating so finally it
01:38 - will always run
01:40 - finally so now save it
01:43 - and so number of cakes let's do
01:47 - six and then three people and then it
01:50 - says each person can have two
01:52 - cakes and then it says thanks for eating
01:54 - so always say thanks for eating
01:56 - we're going to do accept zero division
01:59 - error as
02:00 - so error is basically error and this
02:03 - will
02:04 - this is the code that will run if we
02:06 - type zero then we're gonna print
02:08 - error which is the error
02:12 - it will say so we can know where to fix
02:14 - the error in the code
02:16 - and then it'll say someone has to eat
02:18 - the cake
02:24 - zero people to share the text and then
02:26 - it says division by zero so that's the
02:29 - error
02:29 - then it says someone has to eat the cake
02:32 - next
02:33 - we're gonna do final error except value
02:35 - error which we raise
02:37 - here over here and then i'll do print
02:41 - err this cake must be sheet so we're
02:43 - gonna save
02:44 - them right now so enter a number of
02:46 - cakes so i'm gonna do
02:48 - 9. and enter a number of people to share
02:51 - the case one
02:52 - said that it says one this cake must be
02:55 - shared
02:56 - then it says thanks for eating so this
02:58 - is
03:00 - exception handling well that was fun
03:03 - and that's it for today thank you for
03:06 - watching
