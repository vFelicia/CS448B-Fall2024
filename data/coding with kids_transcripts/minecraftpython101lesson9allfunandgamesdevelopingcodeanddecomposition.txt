00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in america vegetation
00:06 - so we're in python 101 lesson so first
00:09 - we're going to talk to the ceo since ceo
00:11 - says we're trying to develop a game the
00:14 - game is called agent later so it's like
00:16 - space elevators this idea is that you
00:18 - need to move the agent so shoes tickles
00:21 - blocks and gets points however we've
00:23 - been having problems with the different
00:24 - game mechanics can you help us
00:26 - so we're gonna help the ceo build a game
00:29 - called agent vader where instead of
00:32 - ships there's the agent and the enemies
00:35 - are gold blocks so first we're going to
00:37 - talk to the game developer this game
00:39 - developer says i need to get the agent
00:41 - to move left or right depending on which
00:43 - color the player stands on it should be
00:46 - for right and blue should be for left
00:47 - but for some reason there's tuition
00:49 - micro can you write your home code to
00:51 - help me for my problem
00:54 - so orange help
00:56 - the game developer with
00:58 - controls of the agent so that's like a
01:02 - tv and then there's a wire to the
01:04 - controls
01:05 - okay
01:08 - so we're gonna help
01:10 - right red is for right and blue is for
01:12 - left
01:15 - okay so
01:17 - first
01:18 - we're gonna declare function so we're
01:21 - gonna do def move so it's a function
01:26 - then
01:27 - if
01:28 - blocks dot
01:29 - test
01:31 - for
01:32 - block so it's testing for a vlog
01:35 - light
01:36 - blue concrete
01:38 - position zero
01:41 - negative one
01:43 - zero
01:44 - and then here
01:46 - so
01:47 - we're testing for light blue concrete
01:49 - because this is light blue concrete and
01:50 - when you step on it just like the
01:52 - controller so we want the agent to go
01:54 - left
01:56 - okay
01:57 - then
01:58 - we're going to make the agent move right
02:02 - agent dot move
02:04 - left
02:05 - one so we want the agent to move left
02:08 - because blue is for left
02:10 - right is for right okay
02:11 - then
02:13 - next we're going to do alif
02:15 - else if blocks
02:18 - dot test
02:20 - or block and do red
02:24 - concrete
02:26 - because
02:28 - instead of blue light blue concrete
02:29 - we're gonna do red concrete
02:32 - okay then position
02:35 - zero zero
02:36 - negative one
02:39 - then
02:40 - we will make the agent move right
02:44 - agent
02:46 - patient dot move
02:48 - right
02:55 - okay
02:56 - so we've completed the function
02:58 - then here
03:00 - we're gonna do
03:01 - a while true loop
03:04 - so while true
03:06 - we're going to call the function so move
03:09 - so then we can keep moving the agent so
03:11 - now we're going to run okay
03:13 - let's go blue
03:16 - so we go the opposite direction
03:20 - so we're going to change
03:23 - the left
03:25 - right
03:26 - and right with the left
03:29 - so when you actually completed it i'm
03:32 - going to try one more time
03:34 - okay
03:35 - right
03:36 - and left okay it's so fast
03:41 - his knees are swinging his arms okay
03:43 - next we want to talk to the programmer
03:45 - so the programmer says i need to develop
03:48 - the firing mechanics of the game the
03:50 - agent needs to shoot firework rockets
03:52 - into the blocks and replace them with
03:53 - air but my code is not working out and i
03:56 - do not know why could you write some
03:58 - code to help me so i'm going to help the
04:00 - programmer
04:01 - make the agent fire
04:03 - fire
04:04 - fireworks instead of instead of bullets
04:08 - in the regular game and it's going to be
04:09 - shooting at four blocks
04:12 - so
04:13 - here
04:15 - we're going to do another function
04:17 - called def fire because
04:19 - this function allows the agent to fire
04:21 - the fireworks
04:23 - then
04:24 - we're going to do
04:25 - if block stop test for block gold block
04:28 - positions dot at 18. position position
04:31 - zero two zero so here if
04:35 - so
04:36 - try to test for the block gold block two
04:39 - blocks above the agent
04:41 - so we can detect the gold blocks and
04:43 - shoot the firework rockets
04:45 - so
04:46 - get the position two blocks above so
04:49 - try to detect a gold block
04:51 - then
04:52 - if it does attack the gold block it will
04:55 - the spawn firework rocket so it shoots
04:57 - fireworks
04:59 - at the agent.get position which is two
05:01 - blocks of open then we're gonna pause
05:03 - for 100 milliseconds so we do loop stuff
05:07 - pause 100
05:09 - so the agent doesn't like keep
05:11 - like it's going to be spamming yeah
05:14 - sparing the fire rocket so there'll be
05:15 - actual bunches of fireworks like a
05:18 - firework day but much more yeah then
05:20 - we're gonna do block stop place air
05:23 - positions that add agent dot get
05:25 - position position zero two zero so after
05:29 - we shoot the fire rockets after we wait
05:31 - we're gonna replace the gold block with
05:33 - air so so we basically destroyed the
05:36 - gold block
05:38 - okay
05:40 - and here down here we're going to run
05:42 - the function fire in the wall truth
05:45 - okay so now we're going to run it okay
05:50 - so shot the firework rockwood rocket at
05:53 - the first gold block and the gold box
05:55 - disappeared now let's move
05:58 - yay i want to do the next one
06:06 - [Music]
06:12 - [Music]
06:14 - sometimes the rocket gets stuck
06:16 - underneath
06:21 - go to part two okay part two now just
06:24 - stop one yeah okay so now there are two
06:27 - layers of blocks so there's one higher
06:30 - level instead of just one
06:36 - okay
06:37 - so up here
06:39 - we're gonna do
06:41 - we're gonna do
06:43 - lf
06:44 - and use the fire function
06:46 - lift blocks that test for block gold
06:49 - block so the same as the if body
06:51 - position is zero three zero so there'll
06:54 - be three blocks above the edges so you
06:56 - can shoot farther
06:58 - then
06:59 - do
07:00 - monster spawn firework rockets and asian
07:02 - dot get position so we'll shoot a
07:04 - firework rocket again and then we'll
07:07 - pause 400 milliseconds so it's just like
07:09 - the last code but you change the
07:11 - position yeah so we can shoot one block
07:13 - higher then block stop place air so
07:15 - replace it with air
07:17 - so then
07:19 - we're going to wrap it
07:22 - it's not a shot the second block two
07:26 - i thought it was like i thought first
07:29 - just one rocket it would disappear to
07:32 - both like both of them this is the tech
07:34 - boop
07:35 - okay
07:40 - it's coming at his head maybe there's
07:42 - like in a head there's like a lot of
07:44 - fireworks inside it and then they will
07:46 - shoot
07:48 - like the uh machines in july 4.
07:52 - okay nice look yay
07:55 - it looks like
07:56 - it looks like it looks at us and it's
07:59 - like
07:59 - when i look at it it's like
08:01 - did it do well balls it will say okay so
08:05 - lastly we're gonna talk to the game
08:07 - developer so the game developer says i'm
08:10 - trying to develop the scoring system for
08:11 - the game as well as the splash screens
08:13 - at the start and the end of the gaming
08:15 - session but for some reason it is not
08:17 - working can you write some code to help
08:19 - me with my problem so i'm going to help
08:21 - the game developer over the splash
08:22 - screens at the start and the end and the
08:26 - scoring
08:27 - so now
08:28 - here you can see there are more blocks
08:30 - and there's that number you can't break
08:33 - the dialogue
08:34 - okay
08:35 - so first in the fire function
08:37 - we're gonna do global score so we're
08:40 - gonna make the score variable global so
08:42 - you can use it everywhere
08:43 - then after
08:45 - we're gonna do score plus equals one so
08:48 - we're gonna add one to the variable
08:50 - score
08:51 - so
08:52 - here what it does is that
08:54 - if you if the agent detects a good block
08:57 - two blocks above it it will spot
08:59 - fireworks pause and replace it with air
09:03 - so there's a score when you
09:05 - when you
09:06 - destroy a gold block or a short ship you
09:08 - get a score so here you add one score
09:11 - if you can't if it if it doesn't detect
09:14 - a gold block two blocks above it it'll
09:16 - go to lf which is three blocks and then
09:18 - after all this we're going to do
09:21 - and add one to scored again
09:23 - means you also destroy one
09:26 - so and then here we're gonna do splash
09:29 - screen we're gonna do gameplay.title
09:32 - mobs.target nearest player so we're the
09:33 - nearest player we're the only player and
09:36 - then it will do the title
09:39 - agent vader's start
09:41 - and then we're also
09:43 - gonna hear while true and
09:46 - delete the true and do
09:48 - while while
09:51 - score
09:53 - is less
09:56 - or equal to 15.
09:59 - okay
10:00 - then i'll do
10:02 - okay and call these functions
10:05 - do gameplay.title
10:07 - mods.target nearest player it'll do
10:09 - congratulations you win after we finish
10:12 - the game
10:13 - and then we're going to do mom's spawn
10:15 - lightning ball at agents position
10:19 - so we're in lightning bolt the agent
10:22 - okay agent will say don't be
10:24 - sorry boss
10:25 - okay now all right okay
10:28 - let's put it down
10:29 - in your face
10:43 - oh it needs to go down oh it's going
10:46 - down
10:47 - so here you can't destroy the diamond
10:50 - blocks
10:52 - but
10:53 - it doesn't detect it because we don't
10:55 - have anything because we need a
10:56 - detective
11:03 - look at the lightning the agent got a
11:05 - little on fire i saw
11:07 - all right was it that yay more rockets
11:10 - was it was so weird
11:13 - [Music]
11:21 - um yeah
11:24 - back to the ceo the steve and the
11:28 - skeletons with the red glass that is
11:32 - actually the bullet for the sea steve
11:34 - head shooting at all those skeletons
11:37 - yeah hopefully the steve head doesn't
11:40 - die
11:41 - okay well that was fun and that's it for
11:44 - today thank you for watching remember to
