00:00 - welcome to coding with kids
00:03 - my name is julia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're in codehog
00:08 - course f functions in minecraft so
00:11 - instructions say a function named
00:13 - billbridge right here
00:15 - is in your workspace all of the code you
00:17 - need to cross the river is built right
00:19 - in snap the small green builds bridge
00:22 - function block into your workspace
00:24 - twice to fix the path and get steve to
00:27 - the redstone torch
00:28 - redstone torches right here okay so the
00:31 - function
00:32 - build bridge makes the agent right here
00:35 - move forward place the oak plank and
00:38 - repeat it
00:39 - and then move forward two times and turn
00:42 - right
00:43 - so it will go here and
00:47 - yeah so it says
00:50 - we need how many little bridge
00:53 - functions do we need so d
00:57 - steve can get the restroom torches let's
01:01 - first do one let's see what happens
01:05 - now let's do steve and follow him
01:13 - uh-oh we still need one more bridge but
01:16 - if you want to do the diamond
01:19 - how many bridges do we need let's do
01:22 - three of them
01:23 - and let's see what happens
01:27 - follow that agent
01:30 - hey throw it fast but he's much faster
01:33 - he says oh we're getting the diamond
01:37 - and we got the diamond now
01:48 - now we're on lesson nine there is ice in
01:51 - the way
01:52 - there clear path functions can help you
01:54 - destroy the ice and get steep to the
01:56 - minecart
01:57 - minecart is right here the function
01:59 - clear path
02:00 - destroys block moves forwards and plays
02:03 - great
02:04 - so there is let's do clear class one
02:08 - time
02:08 - and see what happens
02:10 - [Music]
02:11 - why do we need the gravel because when
02:14 - you break the ice there's water
02:16 - so we can't walk on water so we have to
02:19 - place something
02:20 - how many times do we need to do clear
02:22 - path two
02:24 - no three let's try
02:30 - repeat three times
02:37 - [Music]
02:42 - there's a problem so maybe we have to
02:45 - repeat
02:46 - four times let's try five
02:51 - [Music]
03:00 - hmm we need one more time so six times
03:11 - let's find that agent but don't get in
03:14 - front of him
03:18 - okay now let's get that minecart
03:25 - next
03:28 - one less than 10. can you spot the
03:32 - difference
03:33 - between the two functions in your
03:35 - workspace
03:36 - use these functions with other code from
03:39 - the toolbox
03:40 - clear a path for the minecraft then
03:42 - collect the flint and steel
03:43 - something still is right here we need to
03:46 - collect
03:48 - differences so first let's look at the
03:50 - function first function
03:51 - is called fixed load
03:54 - three times destroy block move forward
03:56 - and place rails
03:58 - so it goes forward and place rails
04:01 - in three blocks so what do we do
04:06 - okay let's see then the fixed short path
04:09 - repeats two times to show the buck move
04:11 - forward place rest
04:12 - so the difference between the two
04:14 - functions is that this repeats three
04:16 - times
04:17 - and this repeats two times so first
04:20 - let's try to fix long passers
04:25 - but first we need to turn light to get
04:28 - to where we have to be like we can just
04:32 - go
04:32 - forward see but we have to break blocks
04:37 - oops it has to destroy block first
04:41 - okay so we have to turn right
04:45 - turn right
04:48 - [Music]
04:54 - then press it and turn right
04:57 - let's see
05:01 - it's breaking your tracks
05:06 - [Music]
05:08 - oh just want
05:10 - here yeah turn what yes
05:15 - let's do it again
05:20 - i think we have to do something else oh
05:23 - maybe we have to turn right place rails
05:27 - then move forward
05:32 - okay turn
05:35 - right first
05:38 - then place rails turn right then place
05:41 - reds to fix
05:42 - the rails so we don't right now we don't
05:46 - need it yet
05:48 - just turn right then um right now we
05:51 - don't need that strong path
05:55 - because really do is nothing let's do
05:58 - shortcuts
06:03 - uh it's fixed on the path dance picture
06:05 - pack
06:06 - [Music]
06:14 - at least we still have to fix one girl
06:18 - so let's do termite place fast and move
06:20 - forward
06:22 - no clear all the blocks first then
06:26 - turn right place rounds then move
06:28 - forward
06:30 - [Music]
06:33 - why do we need a destroy block
06:35 - [Music]
06:38 - so we need a turn right
06:43 - place rails
06:46 - move forward
06:50 - place rails then
06:54 - turn left two times
06:59 - let's see
07:03 - let's press run hmm so it plays two
07:07 - rounds here
07:09 - now turn left now we have to break
07:14 - the blocks so we need repeat three times
07:17 - move forward
07:23 - repeat three times
07:28 - oopsies
07:30 - move forward
07:34 - then fix short path because it only has
07:37 - two blocks here now three blocks right
07:39 - like right there
07:42 - whoopsies
07:46 - short path now let's see
07:58 - okay now we can turn now we have to
08:02 - turn right and move forward two times
08:04 - let's do
08:07 - but the agent's right there he needs
08:09 - turn back and move forwards two times
08:17 - move over two times
08:21 - let's do it let's see
08:34 - [Music]
08:39 - now we have to fix long half
08:42 - [Music]
08:44 - so it will clear the three blocks right
08:48 - here
08:49 - so we can get to that flint and steel
08:54 - [Music]
08:58 - let's follow that agent
09:01 - to get
09:10 - [Music]
