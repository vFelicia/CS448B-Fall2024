00:01 - welcome to quitting with kids
00:04 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:06 - today we're in colorado
00:08 - so the instructions say they're
00:10 - multiplying can you make two or more
00:12 - mouse straws appear every time
00:14 - r2d2 gets one mouse draw get 20 mouse
00:17 - draw
00:18 - so one run add a master play rdt
00:22 - to three sound so we need okay
00:27 - yeah but when we touch one of them it
00:30 - just disappears it doesn't
00:31 - do anything so we so let's start
00:35 - okay then we need to do this when you
00:38 - get mouse drawer that means when
00:40 - we touch it add a hundred
00:43 - add a mouse jord so there's another one
00:47 - and or two we can add two
00:51 - yeah okay then play random sound
00:54 - yes so it will play around yourself so
00:57 - right now there's one most mouse droid
00:59 - and let's get it
01:00 - wait it's so fast now there's two
01:04 - more because we touched it
01:07 - so our mission is to get 20 miles and
01:12 - our score is
01:13 - 100 right now so that one yeah
01:18 - we finally got our second one now
01:20 - there's three
01:25 - that um best thing to
01:28 - the hardest thing about them is they're
01:31 - so fast yeah and they go
01:33 - random directions yeah
01:37 - and when i tried to get them yeah
01:42 - now there's four i'll get
01:45 - you let's stop
01:48 - it
01:52 - it seems there's still too little should
01:55 - we
01:55 - add more mouse draws once you touch
01:58 - one let's add three
02:02 - no four okay so this will make it easier
02:06 - yeah because once you touch one mouse
02:08 - draw
02:09 - four more will appear
02:13 - so it's easier for me to catch because
02:16 - there's more
02:18 - but still hard to catch wine
