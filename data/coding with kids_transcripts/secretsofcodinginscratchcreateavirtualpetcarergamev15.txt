00:15 - did everything so today i added
00:17 - here the bathtub so there's a water
00:20 - bottle
00:21 - and
00:22 - yeah
00:23 - there's water ball basketball and a fish
00:26 - which is eating okay first we need to
00:29 - drink some water dirty we're getting
00:31 - dirty very dirty oh dude hunger
00:34 - then we're gonna get some fun
00:36 - [Music]
00:38 - let's do first
00:40 - and then here okay so then when you
00:42 - press this button there are the
00:43 - instructions okay
00:45 - so
00:46 - today so first i added the bathtub so
00:49 - you can see this bathtub image so that's
00:51 - where the first variable is so the first
00:55 - variable so the bathtubs code is simply
00:58 - when the sprite is clicked so when you
01:00 - press the bathtub so the octopus can
01:02 - wash itself a board cast a message
01:04 - called wash so then in the octopus
01:09 - uh there is when i receive the wash
01:11 - message from the bathtub well glide one
01:14 - seconds to back
01:15 - slide one second to bathtub so the
01:17 - octopus will go to the bathtub
01:19 - then it'll start sat ocean waste that's
01:21 - the closest sound i could get to like
01:24 - washing in the path
01:25 - then i change dirty by minus two so you
01:28 - don't want to get
01:29 - ten early yeah basically you get too
01:32 - much of the variables you'll get you'll
01:34 - lose okay so we're gonna change 30 by
01:37 - minus two because dirty goes up
01:39 - more fast than the other one so i just
01:41 - minus two because you get 30 yeah and
01:43 - then glide one second to the regular
01:45 - position here
01:46 - okay
01:47 - and then in the fish originally i think
01:50 - it was this yeah so it was an evil
01:53 - instead of dory so i changed the dory
01:55 - and the water bottle it was like a
01:57 - plastic one that's i changed to a more
01:59 - it's more eco-friendly yeah you know so
02:02 - i changed it into a glass one but it's
02:06 - not full this one's an awful and the
02:08 - soccer ball is the it's called soccer
02:10 - ball so it was originally soccer ball
02:12 - but i just changed it into basketball i
02:14 - don't want to like change all this stuff
02:16 - so it's still called soccer ball
02:18 - so button
02:20 - i don't want to make it blue no because
02:22 - it's
02:23 - you know maybe a little bit too blunt
02:26 - into the background because you know the
02:28 - octopus is
02:29 - in the ocean so you wouldn't really want
02:32 - to be blue yeah so now the octopus has
