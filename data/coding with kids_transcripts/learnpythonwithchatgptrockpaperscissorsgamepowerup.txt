00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:02 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're use
00:05 - chat gbt to make a game in Python So
00:07 - today we're going to use trash gbt to
00:09 - make a rock paper scissors game with a
00:11 - power up in Python so I encountered a
00:14 - lot of bugs and we fix them all and
00:17 - here's the game so by the way the double
00:19 - down power up lets you use two items in
00:22 - one round like you can choose paper and
00:24 - scissors in one
00:25 - round and we're going to play against a
00:28 - bot so first we're going to import the
00:30 - random module to allow us to use code
00:32 - and functions inside it then we're going
00:35 - to do a function called get player
00:37 - choice we're going to do while true
00:39 - we're create a variable called choice
00:41 - and it ask us enter a choice rockes or
00:44 - double up we're use the lower function
00:47 - then we can enter answer and that answer
00:49 - is going to be stored in the choice
00:51 - variable then if choice is in the list
00:54 - of valid answers then it will return
00:56 - Choice else if it's invalid answer it'll
00:59 - print invalid Choice please choose some
01:01 - rock paper scissors or double up then
01:04 - we're going to create a function called
01:06 - get bot choice we're going to turn
01:08 - random that choice rock paper or
01:09 - scissors so the bot doesn't have the
01:11 - double up power up and it'll choose a
01:14 - random Choice from these three then
01:17 - we're going to have the play game
01:18 - function we're going to have player
01:19 - choice and Bot Choice then the player
01:21 - choice is equal to double up that means
01:24 - use the double up power up going to
01:26 - print you use the double up power up
01:28 - then it's going to ask us for two
01:30 - choices and you it can be the same if
01:33 - you want for some reason then it it'll
01:35 - show you what you played you played blah
01:37 - blah blah and blah blah blah with the
01:39 - double up power up then it will store in
01:41 - the variable then it will print your
01:44 - choice and the boss Choice then if
01:46 - instance player choice is a duple player
01:49 - it'll have two variables player wins and
01:51 - Bot wins for item and player choice if
01:54 - item is equal to bot choice
01:56 - or these cases where you win win it'll
02:00 - do player wins plus equals one else
02:02 - it'll add one to the bot wins variable
02:05 - if player wins is equals to bot wins it
02:08 - return it's a tie else if player wins is
02:10 - more than bot wins you win and then else
02:14 - bot wins if player choice is equal to a
02:17 - bot Choice it will return it's a tie
02:20 - else if these winning cases for you a
02:23 - return you win else bot wins and then
02:26 - the main code is print welcome to rock
02:30 - paper scissors with a double up power up
02:32 - it's like introducing the game so while
02:35 - true player choice it get your player
02:38 - your choice and the bot Choice and then
02:41 - it'll store the result in the result
02:43 - variable then it will print the result
02:46 - if you win you lose or it's a tie then
02:49 - there's a choice to play again do you
02:51 - want to play again yes no then if play
02:53 - again if your answer is not yes it will
02:56 - break and then here we W run the code so
02:59 - now let's play play you want to go first
03:01 - you go first okay so first I'm just
03:03 - going to play regular I'm going to do
03:05 - rock then watch those paper so bot wins
03:08 - that's sad do yes which one should I
03:11 - choose now double up double up you use
03:15 - the double up power up let's choose
03:18 - Rock So typos can be bad so add the
03:23 - extra space there then scissors so after
03:26 - you answer you can't add extra space or
03:28 - else it'll be any valid
03:30 - choice you chose rock scissors and boto
03:34 - scissors you win cuz I had Rock so the
03:36 - scissors tied okay so I want to play now
03:40 - okay yes okay so your choice double
03:47 - up okay
03:49 - um
03:51 - scissors and
03:53 - paper bot chose Rock so it's a tie
03:56 - because rock beats scissors so the bot
03:59 - has one point and paper beats Rock so
04:01 - you also have one point so it's zero
04:04 - let's play again one last time you want
04:07 - to use double up yeah you choose one and
04:10 - I'll choose one double up I choose Rock
04:14 - okay then I'll choose
04:18 - paper you choose paper and rock bot
04:21 - choose Rock we win because rock and rock
04:24 - is a tie and we beat the Rock with the
04:26 - paper so you can also do this um with
04:30 - your friends and play together or by
04:32 - yourself well that was fun and that's it
