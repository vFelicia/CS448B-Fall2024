00:00 - welcome to cting with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're on
00:05 - the hour of Escape estate and in the
00:08 - last video we completed this room with
00:10 - the crate minu and now we're going to go
00:11 - through the door well the portal loading
00:15 - so we said bye to the crate menu let's
00:17 - see where we're going to
00:18 - go where we we're like in a library a
00:22 - bedroom it's the diary Pages let's go
00:25 - let's
00:26 - see entry number 10 the driver dear
00:29 - diary my travels have found me in a
00:31 - small sitting room is warmer and
00:32 - inviting it feels like I could just stay
00:34 - here forever no I must press on strange
00:36 - things are foot here and I'm pretty sure
00:38 - I'm not alow it's creepy okay let's
00:41 - search the room for particles and click
00:43 - the button okay so now I think we need
00:46 - to turn all the lamps on the Redstone
00:48 - lamps let's see the instructions you
00:51 - need to open the door by powering all of
00:53 - the lamps each light you turn on will
00:54 - open the door just a little more use the
00:56 - move cursor function to position the
00:58 - cursor over light then use turn light on
01:01 - so we're just going to have to turn on
01:03 - all these lights okay let's see so let's
01:06 - see the code first the example 1 2 3 4
01:11 - so here we only need to move the cursor
01:14 - yellow one two three four five six seven
01:19 - okay so we need seven times so we but we
01:21 - can make this simpler by using this
01:23 - repeat loop as show there okay so we
01:26 - just need this and then we're going to
01:29 - add
01:32 - turn light on
01:35 - function and then we just have to repeat
01:37 - it seven times I
01:43 - think
01:47 - seven then remember to add the
01:50 - tab okay so let's run
01:53 - it 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven okay so you open
02:02 - the door now we're in another
02:06 - room okay so search room for particles
02:08 - again oh seems like we have to fill
02:11 - these holes let's
02:13 - see laser reveal fill in all the holes
02:16 - in the floor with the cursor to open the
02:18 - curtain use and then use the functions
02:20 - move cursor and place blocks so this is
02:23 - kind of different from the other one but
02:24 - we still use the same
02:27 - functions okay
02:31 - so we could just move use orange for so
02:35 - first place block and then um use orange
02:38 - one two three four
02:42 - times okay so four times so we have to
02:45 - do it one more time or we can use a
02:47 - repeat
02:48 - Loop okay so we're going to just use a
02:50 - repeat Loop right
02:52 - [Music]
02:54 - now without the place block just for the
02:57 - move cursor orange four yeah four times
03:00 - just with
03:01 - the without to place block we're gonna
03:04 - have to place the block first before the
03:09 - loop so before that we're going to have
03:11 - to place the block and then after that
03:13 - we have to place a block
03:18 - too okay so let's
03:23 - see oh forgot the colons
03:27 - okay okay
03:30 - okay so we got the first two done then
03:34 - we have to move yellow four times too so
03:36 - then we're go for Iron Range four
03:41 - again move cursor
03:44 - [Music]
03:48 - yellow oh we forgot to place block we'll
03:51 - just add that
03:53 - later after that we have to move magenta
03:56 - forward down too so first place block
03:58 - and then we're going to for for range
04:01 - again magenta so we move
04:05 - [Music]
04:18 - down then we're going do
04:25 - mag move cursor
04:28 - magenta and then Place
04:31 - [Music]
04:33 - block okay so let's
04:36 - see okay so
04:39 - two
04:41 - 3 four and then we have to move blue two
04:45 - times and then orange two times so blue
04:48 - two times you can use the repeat or not
04:52 - it's your choice cuz and it's the same
04:54 - so it doesn't really
04:57 - matter and then 2 * Orange
05:05 - [Music]
05:06 - then we're going to place a block
05:11 - yeah okay let's
05:13 - see
05:15 - one
05:18 - 2
05:20 - 3
05:23 - 4 five puzzle solved the curtains lift
05:26 - it up
05:28 - wow
05:30 - Museum it's the art
05:35 - room it can't jump in okay let's see
05:39 - what we have to do laser puzzle again
05:42 - solid blocks stop the laser shift a row
05:45 - of green blocks to make the laser pass
05:46 - through the glass blocks to turn on the
05:49 - light on the other side use the shift
05:51 - row function to do it so we we're just
05:54 - going to have to use green right now and
05:56 - the right or left so let's see just make
06:00 - that laser right
06:05 - now so you have to know where the lases
06:08 - are okay so the so that works but then
06:12 - we have to use do this too so the coding
06:14 - example actually helped us if solve the
06:16 - first one but now we have to do these
06:19 - three and the yellow so we could just
06:22 - move the green left one time and then
06:27 - yeah so first green left so we're just
06:32 - going to do one of
06:36 - this and then let's see so we're just
06:41 - going to do one of that so it works and
06:44 - the yellow one time okay that works I
06:47 - guess okay oh there's even red now so
06:53 - move green one time let's
06:55 - [Music]
06:57 - see oh so that's let's see what this
06:59 - does first so green
07:02 - left and the
07:06 - yellow red
07:08 - [Music]
07:12 - oh oh so let's see how how do we have to
07:16 - move this
07:18 - one what do you
07:20 - think okay so the yellow and green works
07:24 - but the red doesn't
07:27 - work so the green work
07:30 - the yellow
07:31 - work but the red doesn't
07:37 - work okay so let's see how it is in
07:40 - first you need to move two move two two
07:44 - to the left two to the left uh or wait
07:48 - it's one to the left right we'll try
07:51 - that two to we'll try one left why did
07:55 - you delete that because we just need to
07:58 - move it one time since it's only one
08:00 - block
08:01 - right let me see we add a left after the
08:08 - code
08:09 - wait okay what do what how would you do
08:15 - it oh I left after the code okay all
08:23 - [Music]
08:28 - right
08:34 - okay two
08:39 - [Music]
08:41 - times okay so let's see so you can just
08:44 - also use a repeat to make that
08:48 - [Music]
08:49 - easier one
08:53 - two
08:54 - [Music]
08:55 - three
08:58 - four
08:59 - [Music]
