00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - edible so edible is a coding platform
00:08 - where there are lots and lots of
00:09 - problems you can solve using different
00:12 - kinds of coding languages So today we're
00:14 - going to do three easy coding challenges
00:16 - in edible using python so our first
00:20 - problem is called moving house
00:22 - the instructions are I'd like to
00:24 - calculate how long on average I have
00:26 - lived in the same house given a person's
00:29 - age and the number of times they've
00:31 - moved houses and the variable moves
00:34 - return the average number of years that
00:36 - they've spent living in the same house
00:38 - so for example it would give us the
00:41 - number of the age of the person then the
00:45 - number of times they moved so here
00:48 - uh 30 years and one move that means two
00:51 - houses so you do 30 divided by two
00:53 - equals 15. okay and then you also need
00:56 - to round to the nearest year
00:59 - okay so first we have a function called
01:01 - years in one house with variables age
01:04 - and moves so first we're going to do
01:06 - we're going to create a variable called
01:08 - houses equals moves plus one because I
01:12 - figured out that the number of moves
01:15 - plus one is the number that you have to
01:19 - divide the H by to get the answer
01:22 - because they still will have to have one
01:25 - house and then they move to another
01:27 - house
01:28 - so they'll have like if they move two
01:30 - times they'll have their first house and
01:33 - then they move to the second house and
01:34 - they move to a third house
01:36 - so then we're gonna make a variable
01:38 - called years equals H divided by houses
01:41 - to figure out how many years on average
01:44 - uh the person spent in each house
01:48 - so I thought then we're gonna we also
01:51 - need to round to the nearest year so
01:53 - we're gonna do a variable called rounded
01:56 - and use the function round and working
01:58 - around the number of years to and then
02:03 - we put zero because that's how many
02:04 - decimal places we want which is zero
02:07 - decimal places just the whole number
02:10 - family we're just gonna return the
02:12 - variable around it now we're going to
02:15 - check our test cases there's 80 and 0
02:18 - moves so you just do 80 years in one
02:22 - house so that person stayed in in one
02:25 - house for
02:26 - um their whole life yeah and then
02:28 - there's a baby that's one years old and
02:30 - there's Zero moves so there's one year
02:32 - in one house
02:34 - okay so we passed all our tests onto our
02:37 - next coding challenge it's called
02:39 - basketball points the instructions are
02:42 - you accounting points for a basketball
02:44 - game given the amount of three pointers
02:46 - scored and two pointers scored find the
02:49 - final points for the team and return
02:50 - that value okay so here it will give us
02:54 - two pointer scored and three pointer
02:55 - score here there is one two pointer and
02:58 - one three-pointer so two plus three
03:00 - equals five
03:01 - okay so first we have a function called
03:04 - points with two variables two pointers
03:07 - and three pointers so the first number
03:09 - will be two pointers which is two points
03:12 - in the second number will be three
03:14 - pointers which is three points okay so
03:17 - first we're gonna calculate how many
03:18 - points for each kind of shot so we're
03:21 - going to create a variable called shots
03:23 - for two equals two pointers times two
03:26 - because each two pointer you make is two
03:29 - points and then we're gonna do the same
03:30 - for three pointers so shots for three
03:33 - equals three pointers times three so now
03:36 - we have all the points but now we still
03:39 - need to add them so we're gonna do total
03:41 - points equals shots for Two Plus shots
03:44 - for three which is the total amount of
03:46 - points and then we're gonna return the
03:48 - total amount of points and see the test
03:50 - cases
03:51 - so there is one and two so I think that
03:56 - is two three pointers and one two
03:58 - pointer so three plus three equals six
04:01 - and six plus two equals eight oh there's
04:03 - also two and two which is two three
04:06 - pointers equals six and two two pointers
04:08 - equals four six plus four equals ten and
04:10 - there's a sixty not 69 and a 420. that's
04:15 - a lot that's impossible okay so if we
04:18 - pass all the tests on to our final
04:19 - coding challenge it's called frames per
04:22 - second create a function that Returns
04:25 - the number of frames shown in a given
04:27 - number of minutes for a certain FPS so
04:30 - FPS stands for frames per second so for
04:33 - example here there is one minute and one
04:37 - frame per second so we're there are 60
04:41 - seconds of one minute so we're just
04:43 - gonna do 60 frames
04:45 - in that number of minutes with that
04:47 - frames per second okay
04:50 - so first we have a function called
04:52 - frames with two variables minutes and
04:55 - frames per second so first we're just
04:57 - gonna easily convert minutes to the
05:00 - seconds so we can easily multiply the
05:03 - frames per second times the number of
05:05 - seconds in this number of minutes so
05:08 - first we're gonna do a variable called
05:10 - seconds equals minutes times 60 because
05:13 - there are 60 seconds in one minute so
05:15 - now we have the total number of seconds
05:18 - so there's frames per second so we can
05:21 - do fps2 equals seconds times FPS so
05:26 - seconds and the FPS are both different
05:28 - each time so we're going to use the
05:30 - variable
05:31 - so now in fps2 we have the total number
05:34 - of frames in that number of minutes so
05:37 - now we're going to return that number
05:40 - and see the test cases so there's 99
05:43 - minutes with one one frame per second so
05:47 - it's five nine four zero and then
05:49 - there's zero minutes and 60
05:53 - uh frame per second we don't it's just
05:56 - minutes so it's zero okay so we pass all
06:00 - the tests well that was fun and that's
06:03 - it for today thank you for watching
