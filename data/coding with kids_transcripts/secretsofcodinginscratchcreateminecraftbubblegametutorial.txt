00:22 - um yeah so in the balls you can see
00:25 - there are mobs
00:26 - yeah but with that exact color
00:30 - yeah so i just changed the you know
00:33 - the car so originally avatar was a
00:36 - scratch cat
00:37 - with a backpack this is the alex head
00:40 - and this is the head too which is
00:42 - supposed to be a blanket
00:44 - so i just made a rectangle and we made
00:47 - it
00:47 - black fill out the eyes yeah and this is
00:50 - sad
00:51 - and they should be the same as the
00:53 - original yeah look
00:55 - just exactly this is a little bigger
00:58 - yeah and there's the body
00:59 - so the head is like sometimes a little
01:02 - big that is
01:03 - like silly yeah and there's the bubbles
01:10 - so first there's the red which is i
01:13 - changed from the mushroom so originally
01:15 - in the bubbles they were like scratch
01:17 - characters
01:18 - there's like still signs of these trash
01:20 - cans
01:21 - the red there's the mushroom then the
01:24 - yellow
01:25 - is the ocelot then
01:28 - the green one is still a flag
01:31 - yeah the blue one is a phantom and
01:34 - you can literally see that her one is
01:38 - undermined yeah but it doesn't really
01:40 - show in
01:41 - you know and i changed the background
01:45 - too
01:46 - there is first a desert it used to be
01:48 - just a desert
01:50 - i changed it into a minecraft desert the
01:52 - woods
01:53 - i just found like this picture i like
01:55 - and the underwater
01:57 - so much corals and i added the
02:02 - subwoofer lullaby
02:05 - yeah and at the border
02:10 - i changed it into like a quick zoom
02:12 - pixel
02:13 - and and now let's play i'll go first
02:17 - level one is easy need a minute
02:21 - but there
02:25 - i'm going slowly
02:29 - but i'm actually a pro at this because
02:32 - this is just
02:33 - level one
02:38 - until you get into those hard levels
02:40 - there's about i think
02:41 - 26 levels yeah
02:45 - okay level phase angels okay wow
02:53 - [Music]

03:02 - yay
03:07 - [Music]
03:16 - um
03:19 - [Music]
03:30 - hmm
03:56 - so they're like send a chain reaction
04:00 - it's a little bit easy yeah but
04:03 - sometimes it's a hard way to go there so
04:06 - you need to pop some bubble before you
04:08 - go there
04:11 - no matter what color they are you can
04:14 - still pop
04:14 - it yeah pop it
04:19 - i just do here actually sounds like a
04:22 - better plan
04:24 - right here i think
04:40 - there's 26 levels
04:45 - [Music]
04:47 - it needs to take a long time to play
04:49 - them all
04:50 - hey there's a hole for you to go to
04:52 - those purple i call it
04:54 - purple because it's purple or lightning
04:58 - [Music]
05:05 - right i'm just gonna
05:20 - [Music]
05:21 - oh man there's not a bunch of blues here
05:25 - yeah what should you do you have a blue
05:29 - maybe that's not a good corner i'm just
05:32 - gonna
05:32 - do this
05:43 - [Music]
