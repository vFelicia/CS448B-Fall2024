00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're in minecraft
00:05 - education edition and we're going to
00:08 - explain the code of tnt split
00:11 - okay so this is basically a tnt version
00:14 - of sleeves so you don't need to use
00:15 - shovels
00:16 - so
00:17 - uh you only need to place tnt and then
00:20 - you try to explode explode your
00:23 - opponents
00:24 - well over here we don't have any
00:26 - opponents
00:27 - so unchecked commands fleece so when you
00:30 - type split in the cat
00:33 - it will build
00:34 - um better dogs
00:36 - because you know um tnt can't explode
00:38 - that rocks yeah you won't fall out from
00:41 - zero fifty zero which is 50 blocks above
00:44 - you
00:45 - so it'll be in the sky okay 20 50 20. so
00:48 - it's like
00:49 - up over there somewhere up there so it's
00:52 - like a square or a rectangle yeah
00:55 - then fill with redstone torch
00:58 - these are lit
00:59 - already so like it's coating so the
01:02 - redstone torches will be lit even though
01:04 - there's no redstone source and it'll be
01:07 - right on top of the bedrock so if you
01:09 - break a dirt block block right here
01:12 - it you know the you can then slice the
01:16 - um tnt
01:17 - then it will explode because there's the
01:19 - restroom curve from the redstone yes so
01:22 - from 51 because you know it's supposed
01:25 - one block above the bedrock big rock
01:28 - twenty fifty one twenty so only like one
01:31 - block higher than the bedrock
01:34 - then go with dirt block
01:36 - 52
01:38 - so it's two blocks from the bedrock one
01:40 - block from the western twitches twenty
01:43 - fifty two twenty so so it's where the
01:46 - players can walk and then they can place
01:47 - the team chance out of the on top of the
01:50 - dirt block and then
01:51 - the tnt will automatically start to
01:53 - explode it's like the sun over there
01:55 - yeah
01:57 - then teleport are all players which is
02:00 - only us right now to 10 55 10. so it's
02:03 - like um maybe three blocks above the
02:06 - dirt yeah you won't take fallberry give
02:08 - all players block our item tnt i'm not
02:12 - 64. so you won't run out and then you
02:14 - can explode all the other players so you
02:16 - have 64 tnt and change game mode to
02:18 - survive so you can die
02:22 - we're going to change it to
02:24 - all entities so and then there'll be
02:26 - mods and then we can explore them all
02:28 - okay also minecarts with chest yeah
02:31 - which is weird
02:32 - now look in the python
02:36 - okay so def on enchanted function
02:38 - lockstar fell bedrock so we'll fill the
02:41 - area with bedrocks here position zero
02:43 - fifty zero twenty fifties twenty so
02:46 - twenty to fifty blocks above you and
02:49 - fill operations that replace or replace
02:52 - even if there are blocks they will
02:53 - replace them with bedrock except you
02:55 - know clouds because
02:57 - yeah they're just decorations and then
02:59 - we'll fill the veteran torches with the
03:01 - same thing one block above the bedrock
03:04 - and then blocks that filled dirt
03:06 - position 52
03:07 - 20 50 to 20 fill operation dot replace
03:10 - so we'll get the dirt on
03:13 - another block above the redstone torch
03:16 - then we're gonna mobs that teleport to
03:18 - position so we're gonna teleport all the
03:20 - entities like all the mobs to on top of
03:23 - the dirt
03:24 - that we can explode
03:28 - mobs not give mobs the target all
03:30 - players tnt 64. so give all the players
03:33 - 64 tnt
03:35 - which is only us not the moms yeah
03:37 - because you can't give them all the
03:39 - items then we're gonna set the
03:42 - mode to survival
03:44 - for all the players and then yes yeah
03:47 - then player that on chat when you type
