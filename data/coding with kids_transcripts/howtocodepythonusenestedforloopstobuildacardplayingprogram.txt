00:00 - welcome to getting with kids
00:03 - my name is kalia and my name is andrew
00:05 - today we're going to teach you
00:06 - python so today we're going to learn
00:08 - about iterating through lists
00:11 - by using the four statements so first
00:12 - we're going to do suits equals
00:15 - so it's just like a variable but this
00:18 - square bracket marks the list so hearts
00:21 - spades clubs and diamonds
00:23 - are the four items and they're separated
00:26 - by
00:27 - commas next we're going to do ranks so
00:29 - it's like
00:30 - another list with two three four five
00:33 - six seven
00:34 - eight nine ten jack queen king and ace
00:38 - so right now we're gonna be printing out
00:41 - the whole deck of cards
00:43 - by using nested four statements so next
00:46 - we're gonna do four
00:47 - suit and suits so now this is a four
00:49 - statement
00:50 - so like fours each something so that
00:52 - something is suit
00:54 - which is a variable for the items in the
00:57 - suits so first item is in suits is a
01:01 - heart so it will check hearts first and
01:03 - space then clubs and diamonds
01:05 - so then we're gonna put a four statement
01:08 - inside another four state
01:09 - so for rank and ranks so then we're
01:12 - gonna
01:13 - do the ranks list then print f string
01:16 - rank of suit
01:18 - so it's first let's check hearts and
01:20 - then
01:21 - it'll first check two in the ranks
01:24 - then it will print like the two items
01:27 - that
01:28 - is checking in the list so uh it'll
01:30 - first print
01:34 - two of hearts on the first time it runs
01:37 - the for loops
01:39 - i'm going to save it with ctrl s and run
01:41 - it so i did
01:42 - p y list not p y so let's go
01:46 - up here there's a lot of that actually
01:48 - yeah
01:50 - so there's two of hearts
02:06 - six of hearts eight of hearts
02:09 - this is really long but not
02:12 - too loud then
02:16 - there is eight okay then nine of
02:19 - spades oh yeah there's a lot
02:22 - there's two of hearts three of hearts
02:25 - four of hearts five four hearts six of
02:26 - hearts
02:27 - seven hearts eight of hearts nine of
02:29 - hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts
02:31 - queen of hearts king of hearts and ace
02:33 - of hearts and it will repeat for spades
02:36 - clubs and diamonds so now let's see what
02:39 - will happen if we switch
02:41 - the suits in the first for loop into
02:44 - ranks and the
02:45 - inner for statement into suits
02:48 - let's change the suit
02:51 - to rank
02:55 - and the students into
02:58 - ranks and then the ranks
03:02 - to suits and the rank
03:06 - to suit so now
03:09 - it will be like two hearts no it will be
03:13 - two yeah two of hearts two of spades two
03:17 - of clubs and
03:18 - two diamonds and then it will be oh
03:21 - yeah and then free of hearts free of
03:23 - spades free of clubs and free of
03:25 - diamonds and
03:27 - it will repeat so let's save it and see
03:29 - what will run
03:30 - now so let's do
03:33 - oops
03:38 - py let's stop py so here
03:41 - is the bottom of the water printed
03:43 - there's the ace of diamonds ace of clubs
03:46 - eva spades ace of
03:47 - hearts and it repeats that for all the
03:49 - items in ranks so like
03:51 - reversed the thing so like there's
03:55 - two parts not hearts of two well there's
03:58 - two parts two of spades not
04:00 - hearts of two and hearts are free now
04:04 - next we're gonna do import random and
04:07 - numbers equals then a bunch of numbers
04:09 - so import what's help hyphen we're using
04:11 - a module and random is the module we're
04:14 - using
04:14 - and is a built-in module so in another
04:16 - video we also learned about the python
04:18 - standard library and the
04:20 - and import so next we have a list called
04:24 - numbers with a bunch of random numbers
04:27 - then we'll do selected number which is a
04:29 - variable
04:30 - equals random.choice numbers so we need
04:33 - to do
04:34 - random dot choice number so choices
04:36 - function
04:37 - because the choice function is inside
04:39 - the random module
04:40 - so the choice function will choose a
04:43 - random item from our list
04:45 - numbers and then that item is stored in
04:48 - the variable selected number
04:49 - then we're going to print selected
04:51 - numbers so you can like make it into a
04:53 - guessing gate
04:54 - next we're going to do selected numbers
04:56 - which is another variable
04:57 - different from a selected number because
04:59 - that's s then random choices
05:02 - numbers k equals free so choices will
05:05 - also pick items
05:06 - out of your list randomly well
05:10 - pick multiple random items
05:13 - so k equals free is how many items you
05:16 - want choices
05:18 - to pick from your list and those items
05:21 - will be stored inside the variable
05:23 - selected numbers and then print the
05:26 - selected numbers again so let's save it
05:28 - so now let's run it
05:33 - 42 it got the first item in the choice
05:36 - and then the choice is got 8
05:38 - 101 and 77. now we need andrew
05:42 - just what number at least one of the
05:44 - numbers it will come
05:48 - it has to be in the list numbers yeah
05:52 - 23. yeah 23 came
05:56 - out your turn just a number 101
06:00 - oh my 220 freeze
06:18 - there's no 77 my turn
06:21 - choose 55 55
06:27 - 16 16 there's 16
06:31 - so the choices is easier because there's
06:34 - free items that it chooses so like there
06:37 - is more chance you will guess that item
06:39 - but choice is harder because there's
06:40 - only one item it chooses
06:43 - that was fun and that's it for today
