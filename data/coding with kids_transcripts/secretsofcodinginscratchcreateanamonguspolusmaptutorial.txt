00:00 - welcome to kids
00:03 - my name is colleen and my name is andrew
00:05 - today i'm wearing scratching and
00:07 - andrew's account techno468 so
00:09 - today i'm going to show you a project
00:10 - that i remixed called among this polish
00:12 - map so
00:13 - i remixed the original map and i'm
00:15 - trying to make
00:17 - of among us in scratch
00:20 - so i did a lot to the project so today
00:24 - we're gonna do part one which is the
00:26 - report button
00:28 - so i got the report button from the
00:31 - internet and i uploaded here so
00:33 - let's see the code so when green class
00:35 - collected forever
00:37 - if your mouse is down or when you're
00:39 - pressing with your finger if you're on
00:40 - an ipad
00:41 - phone and body is not near which is
00:44 - variable
00:44 - equals one and touching mouse pointer
00:48 - then that means which means you are
00:50 - pressing the button
00:52 - because i didn't do dead body so it just
00:54 - picks a random
00:55 - number of seconds and you can press
00:57 - we're going to switch
00:58 - costume to dead body report too so let's
01:01 - see the costume
01:03 - dead body reported to it's like when
01:05 - when
01:07 - there's dead bodies reported yeah so
01:10 - it's like there's
01:10 - this okay
01:14 - then uh star sound report body longer
01:17 - sound effects so that's when
01:20 - you report a body the sound then every
01:22 - two seconds and then switch costumes
01:24 - for so it will switch the costume to the
01:28 - regular costume
01:29 - which is the yeah
01:32 - so i did a ghost effect so if i click
01:36 - switch costume to report one so what you
01:39 - won't start out the game at like
01:40 - you're already reported and then it'll
01:42 - go to front layer and then step by step
01:45 - which is
01:46 - variable i'm not really using it to zero
01:49 - because i can't make
01:50 - because that is yeah this is not online
01:54 - can't cute so when green flag collected
01:57 - forever
01:57 - if body is not near equals zero then the
01:59 - set goes back to
02:01 - 50. so because when
02:04 - when the body is near so i didn't make
02:06 - bodies yeah now
02:08 - the button will light up because you can
02:10 - report it
02:11 - so if there is no body in here i'm going
02:14 - to set the ghost effect to 50 so
02:17 - like kind of blending with the
02:18 - background so it's not this
02:20 - doesn't seem to
02:26 - forever if body is not near equals one
02:29 - that means there's a body knee
02:30 - and a second suspect to zero so become
02:33 - the regular brightness because
02:35 - yeah because you can report then when
02:37 - grief is gonna collect forever wait
02:39 - pick one to thirty seconds so pick
02:41 - random one to thirty seconds
02:43 - so body is not near to one that means
02:46 - there's body in here
02:47 - but you can't see a the bodies because
02:49 - they i didn't make them then
02:51 - wait five seconds and the set body is
02:53 - not near to
02:54 - zero so by doing this variable there
02:57 - will be
02:58 - you can do these two code to make the
03:01 - report button available so now
03:05 - maybe you'll miss your truth reporting
03:07 - it yeah
03:08 - so now test out the report button
03:16 - there's one imposter among us so you're
03:18 - you'll always be cooling right now
03:20 - okay so the report button this ghost
03:22 - effect is 50 right now
03:25 - okay because it starts out as zero as a
03:28 - variable
03:29 - okay we're now gonna explore paulus
03:34 - while we wait for the import button to
03:37 - light up
03:39 - task task i see a task
03:42 - no they're not actually
03:48 - that's how now it goes back to ghost
03:51 - effect because
03:52 - but yeah the picture oh that was
03:55 - fast yeah so picked a random one to
03:58 - thirty seconds so sometimes you have to
04:00 - wait very long but sometimes
04:01 - let's go like very short
04:05 - yeah laboratory
04:10 - yeah i am going to
04:16 - so i i still didn't make the recording
04:18 - yet but
