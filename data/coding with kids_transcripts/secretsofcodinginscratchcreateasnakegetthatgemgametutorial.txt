00:00 - welcome to cooking with kids
00:04 - and my name is andrew today
00:07 - one two three and in this project i made
00:10 - cosmic
00:11 - gym so as you see there's a snake
00:14 - and few gems a gem which you need to get
00:19 - yeah i grow longer
00:22 - maya i am cheese okay
00:26 - so here is the code for the snakehead
00:30 - there is three sprites the snakehead
00:32 - snake body
00:33 - and gem so when green flat click go to
00:37 - x zero y negative one hundred so
00:40 - is the starting point yeah point in
00:42 - direction
00:43 - zero which is over here going over
00:47 - pointing out here let's go to zero so
00:50 - there's a score variable
00:52 - yeah forever move ten steps if touching
00:54 - color
00:56 - this kind of color which is
00:59 - kind of one of the sprites of the snake
01:02 - body
01:04 - broadcast game over and weight because
01:07 - if you touch one of your bodies
01:09 - which is over here right if you get gems
01:11 - you will grow longer
01:13 - so if you touch it you say ouch
01:16 - it will broadcast game over it's
01:19 - touching
01:20 - edge which is these edge it will rock us
01:22 - game over two so there's two ways to die
01:25 - when i receive game over it will say
01:27 - ouch because
01:29 - you kind of like ouchy yourself
01:32 - and stop all so you lose stop the
01:35 - project
01:35 - when up a recreate pressed point in
01:38 - direction
01:39 - zero because i don't want to like move
01:40 - the whole sprite
01:42 - when down arrow key press point and
01:44 - direction
01:46 - 180 so it's just like this
01:49 - one right arrow key press point in 90
01:53 - and one left arrow key press it will
01:55 - point in negative nine
01:57 - now the snake body
02:00 - when green flat click switch costume to
02:02 - snake trail
02:04 - which is this one this one's the custom
02:07 - ones just like
02:09 - square of green then forever go to
02:12 - snakehead so it will
02:14 - always follow the snakehead it will wait
02:18 - 0.01 seconds it will create a clone
02:22 - of myself so keep getting longer
02:25 - yeah when i start as a clone so right
02:27 - now we're coding the clone
02:29 - point in directions pick random 0 to
02:32 - 3 star which is multiplication
02:36 - nine it will multiply nine
02:39 - and wait 0.1 seconds
02:42 - and switch costume to costume which is
02:44 - just
02:45 - the screen and the weight score
02:48 - dash 5 seconds delete disco
02:53 - so and there's the gem when green flag
02:56 - clicked forever
02:58 - if touching snake heads so if the
03:00 - snakehead gets
03:02 - the gem change score by one so you get
03:05 - one gem
03:06 - and go to expect random negative 220 to
03:11 - 220 so it will like pick a random spot
03:15 - why pick random 160 to 160 so go
03:19 - somewhere else
03:20 - yeah and there's one backdrop which i
03:23 - got it from the
03:24 - sprite backdrop i think snakes live in
03:28 - foresty
03:29 - places so i just put a force black
03:32 - background and now let's play i mean
03:38 - yeah i got that you got one my turn
03:43 - okay
03:59 - andrew oh no i can't touch my nose
04:04 - i can't touch myself you almost touch
04:08 - yourself
04:09 - six oh man at the end when you touch the
04:12 - edge
04:12 - every of those kind of square
04:16 - clones go to the snakehead
04:27 - the most hardest is when it's very close
04:29 - to the
04:30 - edge because it's very close
