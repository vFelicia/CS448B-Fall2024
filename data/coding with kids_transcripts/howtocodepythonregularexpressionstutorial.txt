00:00 - welcome to cutting with kids my name is
00:03 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:05 - that so today we're going to learn about
00:07 - regular expressions so regular
00:09 - expressions is a tool that tries to find
00:11 - a pattern in our sentences so for
00:14 - example if you want to sign up in a
00:16 - website there might be requirements for
00:18 - a password like underscores and
00:20 - uppercase letters so first we'll do
00:23 - import read which is regular expressions
00:26 - then when you do pattern you close
00:28 - read.comply
00:29 - and kalia so andrew and kalia
00:32 - will try to find andrew kaley in our
00:34 - sentences then we're going to do print
00:36 - read.search so search is a function as
00:39 - try to search our pattern
00:40 - in
00:41 - which is andrew and kalia in our
00:43 - sentence so our first sentence is andrew
00:45 - likes minecraft so i'm going to save it
00:48 - and
00:48 - say dead re dot match object because it
00:51 - found andrew in the sentence
00:53 - span equals 0 2 6 so it tells us the
00:56 - span
00:57 - that that means which where it is in the
01:00 - sentence and there's index here so
01:02 - there's one i mean zero one
01:06 - two three four five and six okay then it
01:09 - tells us the match is andrew because it
01:12 - can't find kalia inside our sentence
01:15 - next the sentence we're going to try is
01:18 - i think khalil likes it too so now we're
01:20 - going to save it
01:23 - so did read.match object again the span
01:26 - now is 8 to 13 and the match is kalia
01:29 - because i can't find andrew in it
01:31 - last we're going to do print three dot
01:34 - search pattern welcome to coding with
01:36 - kids so now let's save it and finally so
01:40 - did none because it can't find andrew or
01:42 - kalia inside the pattern so it returns
01:46 - then
01:47 - print undo
01:48 - def which is defined validate email your
01:51 - pattern pattern eagles read.compile your
01:55 - patent then we have a list called emails
01:58 - with free emails which we are going to
02:00 - try this functional andrew at gmail.com
02:02 - kalia hotmail.net and youtube
02:05 - minecraft.minecraft so then we're going
02:07 - to do a for loop for each email in the
02:09 - list emails if not read up match pattern
02:13 - email so if it doesn't match d packer
02:16 - i'll print fail to match then email else
02:19 - i'll print valley email address then
02:22 - we'll do a pattern so there's a pattern
02:24 - you can do a to z and calculus a to z 0
02:28 - to 9 and a bunch of
02:31 - symbols
02:32 - then there's a top
02:34 - validate email packages save it
02:38 - so it did value my address valid email
02:41 - address and valid email address so all
02:43 - of our email addresses were found to
02:45 - this pattern
02:46 - make sure to change the pattern so after
02:48 - the dot it was supposed to be w plus but
02:51 - now after the dot we change it to dot
02:54 - com.net or dot org to pass through
02:58 - validate email
02:59 - save
03:02 - said
03:03 - valid email address valid email address
03:06 - and then failed to match youtube at
03:08 - minecraft.minecraft
03:09 - because this email after a dot it
03:11 - doesn't have a com net or
03:14 - it has minecraft so it didn't match so
03:16 - to fail to match youtube but
03:18 - minecraft.minecraft
