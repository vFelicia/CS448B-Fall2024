00:00 - welcome to getting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today we're going to teach you
00:06 - python
00:06 - so today we're going to learn about
00:08 - defining a function so my question is
00:11 - when do we use a function so we use
00:13 - functions
00:14 - when we want to make our program shorter
00:17 - neater
00:17 - and to change things faster so first
00:20 - we're going to do
00:21 - def say hello so def is basically
00:24 - defined
00:25 - and we're defining our first function
00:27 - called say hello
00:29 - and after this we can program what the
00:32 - function
00:32 - does so our function is going to print
00:35 - hello world
00:37 - then to try out we're going to do say
00:39 - hello so let's save it
00:41 - and run it so printed hello world
00:45 - when we try to use the function
00:49 - and that's exactly what we typed while
00:51 - defining a function
00:53 - so now let's see what if
00:57 - what it will do if we
01:00 - did say hello before
01:04 - we explore defining the function
01:08 - so now oops let's do it
01:11 - save it and run it so it did
01:15 - error say hello is not defined
01:18 - so there will be a book if you try to
01:20 - use a function
01:22 - before it was defined yes so
01:25 - it's ever because you need to define it
01:28 - first then you can use it
01:29 - yeah next we're going to do
01:33 - def say hello name so it's just like the
01:36 - last time but now we have
01:38 - name which is an input parameter so
01:41 - an input parameter is just like a
01:44 - variable and using input parameters
01:47 - that is how we can change things faster
01:51 - with function so we're gonna print a
01:53 - string hello
01:54 - name so that's what the say hello does
01:58 - but how do we know what name is so we
02:01 - can state what the input parameter
02:03 - is when we run it so we're gonna say
02:05 - hello bob
02:07 - so when you write bob that will be
02:10 - stating the input parameter name
02:12 - so it will print hello bob so let's save
02:14 - and
02:15 - run it so it did hello bob
02:18 - so you can change the input parameter
02:21 - every time
02:22 - you run it so now let's see what will
02:25 - happen
02:26 - if we use input parameter
02:29 - while defining a function but don't
02:31 - state it
02:32 - while we are using the function so save
02:35 - it
02:36 - and run it so that error
02:39 - say hello missing one required
02:41 - positional argument
02:42 - name so what if you use an employer
02:46 - while defining a function you need to
02:48 - state it somewhere
02:50 - right so there is an error yeah
02:54 - so if you don't state you need to state
02:57 - it
02:57 - while you run it
03:01 - next we'll do that say hello but we're
03:04 - gonna
03:05 - state the name info parameter
03:08 - equals world while we define it
03:11 - so you don't need a stated there so
03:14 - we're gonna print
03:15 - that string hello name which will print
03:18 - hello world
03:20 - so now we can just run it without
03:23 - stating the input parameter or changing
03:25 - it but you can still change it
03:27 - because we already stated it here so if
03:30 - we do this i will print
03:32 - hello world next i'm going to do say
03:35 - hello bob
03:36 - so we can also still change the importer
03:39 - name
03:40 - or swirls right here but when you run it
03:43 - you can also
03:44 - change the input parameter so here we're
03:47 - changing the input parameter
03:49 - name which is world right now into bob
03:52 - so for
03:53 - hello box so let's save it and
03:56 - run so did hello world
03:59 - here because already stated so it will
04:01 - be hello world
04:03 - and then the second time it will change
04:05 - into bob
04:06 - which is hello bob
04:10 - so next we're gonna do death say hello
04:14 - and we have the name equals world input
04:16 - parameter again
04:18 - and we have a second input parameter
04:20 - called greeting
04:21 - which is none right now which is
04:23 - basically nothing
04:25 - so next we're going to put if inside
04:27 - while defining a function so
04:29 - if gradient equals none which is true
04:32 - i'm going to print f string hello world
04:35 - because name right now is
04:36 - world if reading was something else
04:39 - it will print greeting the name but
04:42 - right now there is no greeting so it
04:44 - will do
04:44 - if yeah it will print hello world
04:48 - so first we're just gonna run it usually
04:51 - so just say hello which will be hello
04:54 - world
04:55 - then we'll say hello bob so we're going
04:57 - to change name
04:59 - which is world into bob so open hello
05:02 - bob
05:03 - then i'm going to say after hello world
05:05 - yeah then
05:06 - say hello again greeting equals howdy
05:10 - so it changed greeting from num to
05:14 - howdy yeah so it'll go to the else now
05:18 - and it will print greeting and name so
05:20 - name is
05:21 - world now so it's gonna do howdy world
05:24 - then our fourth time
05:25 - and last time we're gonna print hello
05:28 - bob and howdy so name is bob and
05:31 - greeting is howdy
05:32 - so go to the else again because reading
05:35 - is not
05:36 - none so it'll print howdy bob so let's
05:39 - save it and run it so it did
05:45 - it did hello bob and there's hello world
05:48 - up there
05:48 - and howdy world and howdy
05:57 - because in the last program we get none
06:00 - yeah we
06:01 - which we just did greeting is none so
06:04 - what type
06:04 - is not so we're going to use the type
06:06 - function which will tell us
06:08 - what type is not so let's save it let's
06:10 - see
06:11 - and run it in class
06:14 - because it's none so i have to be nun
06:17 - yeah because
06:18 - none is basically nothing so it's
06:21 - none type that means no type oh
06:24 - that means like it's nothing but it's
06:27 - still stated as an input parameter
06:30 - yeah yeah well that was fun and
06:33 - that's it for today thank you for
06:35 - watching
06:36 - remember to smash that like and
06:38 - subscribe
06:39 - bye bye
