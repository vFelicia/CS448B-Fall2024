00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew today we're
00:05 - gonna
00:06 - um play quick draw and this is a special
00:10 - edition
00:11 - yeah so quick draw is made um
00:14 - by google yeah so it
00:17 - you can help it by teaching you can help
00:20 - teaching
00:21 - it by adding your drawings to the
00:23 - world's largest student data set
00:25 - shared publicly to help with machine
00:27 - learning research
00:28 - so there are a lot of drawings here
00:31 - and they help ai machine um
00:35 - yeah learn what things are like by a
00:38 - bunch of drawings
00:40 - so i'm going to tap on the ambulance and
00:43 - here there's a bunch of examples of an
00:45 - ambulance that many people draw yes so
00:48 - you are looking at um a lot of
00:51 - ambulance drawings made by real people
00:53 - on the internet
00:54 - at least okay so so the
00:58 - machine learning steps are to first get
01:00 - data
01:01 - so the data for quick draw is the images
01:04 - we draw
01:05 - while we're playing the game then clean
01:07 - prepare and manipulate
01:09 - manipulate data so
01:12 - yeah then train model so it will
01:15 - after um yeah it will
01:19 - start to recognize the drawings and then
01:22 - test
01:22 - data so then you test the data
01:26 - and yeah then you improve it so you
01:29 - improve the machine
01:31 - okay so now i'm gonna go first and
01:34 - you i'm gonna draw the images okay with
01:37 - his finger
01:38 - yeah so it says draw paint can under 20
