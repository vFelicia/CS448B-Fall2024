00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:03 - Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in
00:05 - Minecraft education Edition and in the
00:07 - hour of code Escape estate in the last
00:09 - video we completed this room with a lot
00:11 - of plants and mushrooms this is probably
00:13 - the garden yeah and now we're gonna go
00:15 - for this
00:17 - [Music]
00:20 - yellow
00:24 - all right it's a factory ooh look
00:27 - there's smoke ooh maybe can't find it
00:31 - look down look there's mushrooms again
00:33 - and there's lots of copper and then
00:35 - there's these patterns and that's
00:37 - particle button here
00:41 - oh look there are patterns over there
00:44 - see proceed to code
00:48 - pipes you'll need to add a specific
00:50 - amount of blocks to each of the Hoppers
00:51 - maybe there's something in the room that
00:53 - can tell you how many use the drop blog
00:55 - post usually drop the correct amount of
00:57 - color block into the pipes the draft
00:59 - block function to a swim parameter that
01:01 - defines what color blocks should be
01:02 - dropped yellow blue orange and magenta
01:05 - magnetic magenta okay so let's see this
01:08 - one okay so here are the Hoppers oh it
01:12 - turns different colors no so let's see
01:14 - the pattern I think this is how many of
01:17 - each color we have to put in the hopper
01:19 - okay so two yellow four blue three
01:22 - magenta and two Orange
01:25 - jump down let's hope we don't damage
01:27 - ourselves on these spikes I don't think
01:29 - we can well we are in survive
01:33 - okay so now we're cool okay so here we
01:36 - can also use the repeat block to do it
01:38 - faster it does the same thing
01:42 - it changes color when it one is dropped
01:46 - in so okay so let's do go to code and
01:50 - first do we're gonna do two yellows
01:54 - [Music]
01:57 - yeah so now that we have uh two yellow I
02:00 - think it's
02:02 - um four blue when you check okay
02:05 - see it's two okay then four blue okay so
02:09 - we're gonna use a repeat Loop for eye
02:12 - and range
02:13 - [Music]
02:17 - range
02:22 - four four
02:25 - we have to do drop block
02:29 - blue so now let's run it and check it
02:31 - okay
02:36 - both of these colors right so now we
02:39 - need three magenta and two orange okay
02:42 - so let's make a repeat loop again
02:46 - so three times we'll have to drop block
02:51 - magenta
02:53 - so now let's run it again
02:56 - okay good good it's supposed to turn
02:59 - green onions
03:01 - is the orange so we need two Orange
03:10 - um drop
03:14 - Block Orange
03:17 - [Music]
03:25 - yeah
03:28 - okay now let's run it initial work one
03:31 - two three one two four one two three one
03:35 - two puzzle solved now we need to solve
03:38 - room four particles again
03:42 - here
03:43 - oh there's a cage one chicken it's three
03:48 - sheep five cows and 23 Crown I think
03:52 - um a cow is five pounds a sheep is two
03:54 - pounds and it's three chicken is one
03:57 - pound three oh oopsies three pounds and
03:59 - the crown is 20. I think this is the
04:02 - what what food we should achieve so
04:04 - let's see wait oh
04:07 - [Music]
04:09 - wait you need to scale to reach a weight
04:12 - of exactly 23 pounds maybe there's a
04:15 - sign around here to tell me how much
04:16 - each mob weighs use the summon Animal
04:18 - Farm here to summon a combination of
04:20 - animals that adds up to 23 pounds
04:23 - okay so we can do chicken sheep and cow
04:25 - so let's do our math so the most simple
04:28 - is to get the cows first to get as close
04:31 - as we can which is 20 so that is four
04:34 - cows four cows and then one sheet or we
04:37 - can do the simplest is just spawn 23
04:39 - chickens because they're all one pound
04:42 - sure
04:47 - there's a spawning animals on it
04:50 - okay there's only one chicken
04:52 - so let's find the code again oh let's
04:54 - run the code again
05:02 - same place
05:03 - so it's still not oh okay
05:07 - so now let's do it so we can also use
05:09 - repeat Loops so first we need to do four
05:12 - cows so I gotta deal up repeat Loop
05:16 - for Iron Range four four we're gonna do
05:20 - salmon
05:21 - animal
05:24 - cow so now let's try it should measure
05:28 - to 20. this is 20. so now we need uh
05:31 - three more so which is a one sheep or if
05:34 - you wanna you can do free chicken but
05:36 - we're gonna do one sheep then salmon
05:42 - so now let's run it should be 23.
05:46 - I went down it should be heavy puzzle
05:49 - search room for more particles so let's
05:52 - search
05:55 - hmm I think it's up here this one's
05:57 - pretty big whoa there are lots of uh
06:00 - mobs and Minecarts that's crazy okay
06:03 - then there are huge mob uh faces made
06:06 - out of wool and concrete this is crazy
06:10 - foreign
06:14 - [Music]
06:17 - read the diary page okay entry seven the
06:21 - laboratory dear diary I made the most
06:23 - almost
06:24 - fascinating Discovery today a laboratory
06:27 - so this room is a laboratory it's
06:29 - complete with mysterious machinery and
06:31 - strange experiments the likes of which
06:33 - I've never seen or have I there's
06:36 - something very familiar about this place
06:38 - nuts are diary page so creepy
06:42 - let's go back up
06:43 - [Music]
06:47 - and let's press code to see what we have
06:50 - to do
06:52 - the mods need to be sorted into the
06:54 - right passageways look at the mobs
06:55 - queued up to be sorted insert them based
06:57 - on the order they are waiting use a
06:59 - short malfunction to the set the order
07:01 - they should be stored so let's run this
07:03 - code to see what happens so the zombie
07:05 - skeleton and creeper
07:06 - run zombie zombies okay zombies so this
07:10 - first car will go to zombie zombie and
07:13 - zombie oh there's two s's on their eyes
07:16 - so we only saw each mom to the
07:19 - um right place so like the creeper goes
07:21 - there skeleton goes there and a zombie
07:22 - goes there okay so let's see
07:26 - we can use a repeat Loop too so let's
07:28 - try this zombies
07:30 - some oh that's wrong skeleton zombie
07:34 - skeleton Creeper Creeper zombie zombie
07:40 - once again okay let's go
07:42 - to have a better
07:45 - so it's so there versus skeleton zombie
07:49 - skeleton okay let's delete all this
07:53 - short mob so the first one's skeleton
07:56 - and then zombie
07:59 - skeleton
08:03 - uh you're supposed to do zombie first
08:09 - note skills oh no it's zombie skeleton
08:13 - first oh skeleton first 10 zombies and
08:16 - skeleton
08:20 - over here
08:20 - [Music]
08:22 - yeah second one zombie yeah so we have
08:24 - to change the first
08:26 - [Music]
08:31 - okay let's see skeleton zombie okay and
08:37 - then we have skeleton and two creepy
08:39 - creepers
08:41 - [Music]
08:50 - two times
08:51 - [Music]
08:57 - [Music]
08:59 - okay some dogs from it and they should
09:02 - all go in except for the last two
09:04 - zombies
09:05 - [Music]
09:08 - skeleton went to the creeper and that is
09:12 - stuck it's stuck the Creeper's stuck
09:15 - okay okay they respond can I see it our
09:18 - code again skeleton zombie skeleton then
09:21 - creepy skeleton zombies skeletons let's
09:25 - try again
09:27 - [Music]
09:28 - skeletons
09:30 - it went to zombie
09:34 - zombies went
09:37 - let's just put the zombies at the end
09:39 - yeah
09:41 - because I'm pretty sure our code is
09:44 - right yeah
09:53 - zombie now let's run it wait
09:57 - okay
10:00 - wait let's go back oh it's really moving
10:05 - they weren't all in the wrong ones one
10:07 - was and the creepers still I think I
10:11 - think in Minecraft's glitching yeah this
10:13 - is puzzle sauce puzzle sauce so we did
10:16 - the our code is right except the like
10:18 - the graphics right so you can still copy
10:20 - our code you know there's a little
10:22 - Factory there and look it's the portal
10:24 - that was the portal let's go down look
10:27 - at these green they're so cool there's
10:29 - like gas Chambers okay let's go should
10:32 - we go no next video okay well that was
10:36 - fun and that's it for today thank you
10:39 - for watching Remember to smash like
10:41 - button subscribe bye bye
