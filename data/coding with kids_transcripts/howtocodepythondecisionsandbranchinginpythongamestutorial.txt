00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:02 - kalia my name is andrew today we're
00:04 - going to teach you python so today i'm
00:06 - going to show you how to make the aliens
00:08 - underscore books game so first we have
00:11 - four variables aliens books score and
00:14 - spells so aliens is six books is 10
00:17 - score is 111 and spells is six
00:20 - so first we have if if books is more
00:23 - than aliens print overpowering magic
00:26 - books so books
00:28 - are basically our magic books which help
00:31 - us defeat the aliens
00:33 - so right now books is more than aliens
00:36 - which is 10 over 6 so we're in a run
00:39 - so
00:39 - it says overpowering magic books let's
00:42 - see what happens if we change the 10 to
00:44 - a 5. okay
00:46 - now i'm gonna run it again so nothing
00:48 - happens because books is less than
00:50 - aliens but it's a print overpowering
00:54 - magic books we need books to be more
00:56 - than aliens okay
00:58 - so next
01:00 - we have
01:02 - books equals four so we restate the
01:05 - variable books from 10 to four
01:08 - if score is more than 110 and books is
01:12 - more or equals to four then it will
01:14 - print past level so our score is 111
01:18 - which is more than 110 and books is more
01:22 - or equal to four so books is four
01:24 - so yeah no print past level so we're
01:28 - gonna run it again so it says
01:30 - overpowering magic books
01:32 - because over here we did not restate the
01:34 - books variable yet so over here books is
01:37 - still um 10.
01:39 - so
01:40 - it also says past level okay
01:43 - so next
01:44 - we're going to do
01:48 - if spells is more than five no print you
01:51 - gained the title protector so it's like
01:54 - an achievement in a game so like you get
01:57 - to like earn a title and like yeah like
02:00 - those like you achieve it and then you
02:03 - get to name yourself like that so if
02:05 - spells is more than five i'll print you
02:07 - gain the title protector so here we have
02:10 - six spells
02:12 - so it's like spells or things you
02:14 - collect along the adventure so you can
02:17 - gain achievements okay you're gonna run
02:19 - it again like it's
02:20 - xp yeah okay now we also have you gained
02:24 - the title protector
02:26 - okay
02:27 - that's a big achievement okay
02:30 - so next we have game over equals false
02:33 - so it's a variable
02:35 - so if game over equals equals true i'll
02:38 - print a game over else it'll print play
02:41 - on so right now we have game over equals
02:43 - false so run the else print play on
02:48 - so now it says play on so
02:50 - you still have lies left so if we
02:53 - turn it to true
02:55 - okay
02:57 - it's going to run the end so it's game
02:59 - over so you restart
03:04 - okay
03:05 - finally we have aliens equals two
03:10 - so we rename it from aliens equals six
03:12 - in the beginning of the program
03:15 - to aliens equals two so now we defeated
03:18 - four and then so far overpowering magic
03:21 - books so if aliens is more than one it
03:25 - will print a spooky
03:27 - is there still aliens left
03:30 - else if aliens is more than zero which
03:34 - can be only one because
03:37 - when you do two
03:38 - that is more than one so it'll just
03:40 - print spooky it won't go on to the else
03:42 - if or the else
03:44 - so if
03:45 - the alice can only be run if your aliens
03:49 - variable has the value of one
03:52 - if there's only one more alien it'll
03:54 - print get that alien because then
03:57 - you will pass the level this is the
03:59 - final level
04:00 - if you have zero aliens so you defeat
04:03 - all the aliens uh it'll go to else print
04:07 - congrats so i'm a master
04:10 - yeah you're a pro gamer so you finished
04:12 - level okay so first we have aliens
04:15 - equals two so print spooky
04:18 - because the variable is right now two
04:21 - which is greater than one so if we do
04:23 - one
04:24 - which is good one the elsewhere get that
04:28 - get that alien
04:30 - okay so if we use our magic books again
04:33 - or use our spells
04:35 - we'll get the aliens down to zero
04:39 - now congrats
04:46 - and then you continue on the game
04:48 - changing the variables yeah okay well
