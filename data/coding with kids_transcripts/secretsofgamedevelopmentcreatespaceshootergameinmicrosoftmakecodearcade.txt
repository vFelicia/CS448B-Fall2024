00:00 - welcome to quitting with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew today our microsoft make code
00:07 - arcade and this one the projects i made
00:09 - called space shooter
00:13 - hey hey i wanna shoot i wanna shoot is
00:16 - there any
00:17 - enemy nearby oh i shoot one i have one
00:20 - point
00:21 - we're just gonna stay i'm gonna get boys
00:26 - okay hot new high score
00:30 - okay now let's see the cup on start set
00:33 - splice
00:34 - space plane to sprite this is the kind
00:37 - of splat i didn't made but
00:39 - it was from over here there's a few
00:41 - there's a lot of
00:42 - planes i can choose i chose which one
00:45 - was it
00:46 - this one so it's like i don't need to
00:50 - draw it
00:51 - then move space playing with buttons so
00:54 - you can move your plane with the buttons
00:58 - over there or the arrow keys on your
01:00 - computer
01:01 - says space plane stain screen or else
01:04 - like
01:05 - like it will bounce off the edges or
01:07 - shorts just stay on the edge you can't
01:10 - because you can use your arrow keys to
01:12 - get the plane out of the screen if you
01:14 - didn't have that block
01:15 - then it would go a screen if i turn it
01:17 - off
01:18 - set life to freeze so you're freezing
01:22 - on any button pressed or a space on your
01:25 - keyboard set
01:26 - projector to butt title a shooting
01:30 - from space plane with vx 200 v
01:34 - y zero so the projectile or the
01:37 - bullet will go forward yeah on
01:40 - game update every one
01:43 - second two thousand milliseconds said
01:46 - bad guy to sprite
01:48 - a kind of bad guy like a smaller one or
01:51 - a kind
01:51 - enemy except bad guy because it's the
01:54 - enemy
01:56 - velocity to vx negative one hundreds
02:00 - for you yeah so bad guy left to screen
02:03 - with
02:04 - said bad guy why to pick random zero to
02:07 - screen height so like not go
02:09 - all in the line and then you can like
02:10 - just go up and then you'll
02:12 - go forever so like they'll appear from
02:16 - a different but left to right to screen
02:19 - width because they always have to
02:21 - be on the left then bad guy auto destroy
02:24 - off so it will it won't auto destroy
02:28 - itself
02:29 - then on sprite of time player overlaps
02:33 - other spy of kind enemies so if you
02:36 - touch the enemy it will destroy other
02:39 - sprite
02:40 - but won't destroy you cameras shake by
02:43 - four pixels for
02:44 - 500 milliseconds because you like crash
02:47 - into them
02:48 - and change life by negative one could
02:51 - lose a heart
02:52 - on sprite of kind projectile
02:56 - overlaps utter sprite of kind enemy
02:59 - feels like you shoot an enemy
03:01 - destroy other sprites destroy spark with
03:04 - fire effects for
03:05 - 500 milliseconds so
03:08 - change score by once dodge the enemies
03:12 - while also
03:12 - shooting the enemy now let's get
03:16 - shooting apples and mommies let's see
03:19 - who should go first
03:21 - oh man you already lost in life
03:28 - well it's kind of cheating to stay in
03:29 - one place yeah
