00:03 - andrew today we're in scratch
00:06 - account techno 468 so today i'm going to
00:08 - show you my remix called minecraft blast
00:11 - so originally it was just
00:13 - a
00:14 - ball blast
00:18 - and this is here let's shoot mob heads
00:22 - and then you get
00:25 - you get golden
00:28 - okay so i'm sure you're watching so
00:31 - first in the player hit box is like
00:34 - basically a canon it was originally a
00:36 - canon and i changed it into a bow
00:39 - because that was like the only shooting
00:42 - thing that fitted
00:46 - originally it was just bullets so
00:49 - here i changed it into a minecraft arrow
00:51 - which fits the bow and then when you
00:53 - level up you get the trident
00:57 - then the balls which were like
00:59 - originally these number balls you're
01:01 - gonna shoot the ball until the number
01:03 - goes down to zero and then it'll pop and
01:05 - go into smaller like slime spike
01:08 - so first the ball is creeper it'll creep
01:10 - your
01:11 - the code like changes the creeper heads
01:14 - color so it might not be like this green
01:17 - one not like a usual one and then the
01:20 - second kind of doll is a zombie head
01:23 - then
01:25 - and the coins
01:26 - and changes so here there are coins
01:29 - so first
01:31 - this first simple coin was supposed to
01:33 - be a regular coin i change it into a
01:35 - golden and go
01:37 - and the second one into diamond because
01:39 - like it fits the original coin's color
01:41 - and then the third one lap is loose
01:44 - then in the skin player i just changed
01:47 - it into a bow so
01:49 - these were basically like
01:51 - shooting animations by
01:53 - just did this
01:55 - okay
01:56 - then the thumbnail was originally ball
01:59 - bass you can kind of see the white
02:01 - shadow
02:02 - to make it like pop out so i did
02:04 - minecraft blast over here
02:06 - and then
02:09 - the sprites this is where i got my
02:11 - sprites here
02:16 - i also changed the tight okay so now

02:46 - [Music]
02:49 - this way i might have escaped them but
02:54 - when andrew goes to level two i'm gonna
02:56 - play
02:56 - i'm not so good but
02:59 - final ball already
03:03 - now you go to level two so level two is
03:05 - like harder and there are more
03:07 - balls with more numbers now you can
03:09 - upgrade yes thirteen so so when you
03:12 - upgrade your coins you get like

03:16 - like diamonds
03:20 - [Music]

04:06 - stronger oh this is so much harder than
04:09 - what i did
04:12 - final ball is a two
