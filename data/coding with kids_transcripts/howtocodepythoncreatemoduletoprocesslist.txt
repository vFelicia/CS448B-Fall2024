00:00 - welcome to getting with kids my name is
00:03 - kalia and my name is andrew
00:04 - today we're going to teach you python
00:06 - today we're going to show you how to
00:08 - make a module and use it so first we
00:10 - will make a
00:11 - file called processor dot py so first
00:14 - we're going in
00:15 - depth process numbers so def is
00:17 - basically defined
00:18 - so here we are defining a function
00:20 - called process numbers
00:21 - and then you can type something here to
00:23 - check and get the numbers
00:25 - then we'll do process list equals to an
00:28 - empty list
00:28 - so the process this will store the
00:31 - numbers
00:32 - then if it's instant so here it will be
00:35 - using a if statement to check if what
00:38 - you typed here
00:39 - is a list if it's not a list it will
00:42 - return an
00:42 - empty list if it is a list it will check
00:45 - the items
00:46 - so for each item in the list
00:49 - you typed in if it's instance item it
00:53 - so if the item is integer it will add
00:56 - the item
00:57 - to the process list which is basically
01:00 - the final list
01:01 - then after we check all the items if
01:05 - it's
01:05 - not a and then you know alif
01:09 - is instance item string if it's a string
01:12 - then if item is numeric if it's a number
01:16 - then converted item equals into item
01:20 - and then it'll process list that append
01:22 - converted i
01:23 - so append the converted item then
01:26 - we're going to process the process list
01:29 - dot sort so it'll sort the list
01:31 - and then it will return process list
01:34 - next we'll
01:35 - define process names so you know
01:39 - then before it was process numbers now
01:41 - and processed
01:42 - names then unprocessed list so
01:45 - we're going to have the process list
01:47 - again
01:48 - and if it's in someone check if it's a
01:51 - list again
01:52 - if it's not a list it'll return the
01:54 - process list
01:55 - and then for it'll check if it is a list
01:58 - it will check the items
02:00 - so if instance item string if it
02:03 - is a string then it will check if it's
02:06 - not a number if it's not a number it'll
02:09 - append the item and then check all the
02:11 - items after it checks all the items
02:13 - they'll sort the list process list
02:17 - and then it'll return processes now
02:19 - we're gonna save it and go to demo dot
02:21 - py or
02:22 - whatever folder so i'm going to do
02:25 - import processor
02:26 - so we can use the functions from the
02:29 - processor
02:30 - dot py file and then
02:35 - be checking this list my list equals
02:37 - five dead four
02:38 - seven steve amy and a bunch of other
02:40 - stuff then
02:42 - we're also going to be trying my bad
02:43 - list which is the variables to see
02:46 - what it will do if we also check a thing
02:48 - that is not listed
02:50 - so first let me check my list
02:53 - is the process numbers function and the
02:55 - process names function
02:57 - once at the after it returns the
03:00 - process list list you know
03:04 - it'll put the list in numbers and names
03:06 - variables
03:07 - and then printing numbers and print
03:09 - names next we're going to check
03:11 - check my bad list so i'm going to do
03:14 - numbers which is a variable equals going
03:16 - to check and use the function process
03:19 - numbers
03:19 - on my bad list now print numbers and
03:23 - names which is a variable again equals
03:25 - processor dot process names my bad list
03:28 - so now we're going to process the names
03:30 - in my bad list then we're
03:32 - printing it so let's save it and
03:37 - so it did for the first one when i was
03:39 - checking process numbers for
03:41 - my list you got four four five seven
03:44 - seven nine
03:48 - so the first list is correct now
03:52 - it checked the process names on my list
03:55 - it did amy dan jill kim and ron dunsty
03:58 - so
03:59 - you can see it's sorted out the list so
04:02 - see
04:02 - amy dan jill
04:06 - steve kim and ronda
04:09 - so that worked and then it's two empty
04:12 - lists because
04:13 - it checks when we define a function it
04:15 - checks if
04:16 - the thing you typed is a list but my bad
04:19 - list is a variable it's not a list
04:21 - so it immediately returns empty
04:24 - lists well that was fun and that's it
04:28 - for today thank you for watching
