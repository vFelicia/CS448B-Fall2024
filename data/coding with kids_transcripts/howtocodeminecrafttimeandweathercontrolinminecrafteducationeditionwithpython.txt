00:01 - welcome to recruiting with kids
00:03 - my name is andrew today we're in
00:06 - minecraft education and
00:08 - we're going to show you a project i made
00:12 - called random time and you can type in
00:15 - the chat
00:16 - um what you want the weather to be
00:19 - too and you can also control the time
00:22 - yes so let's see the code
00:27 - so there's a few code here
00:30 - on start set random onto faults the
00:32 - random one of the variables
00:34 - to false then there's few
00:38 - blocks here that needs false and true on
00:40 - check command random
00:42 - when you type
00:45 - if random on equals false then
00:48 - it's a if an else statement
00:52 - set random on to true then l set random
00:55 - on to
00:56 - false so
00:59 - when we type random in the chat
01:03 - it will it will see if random on
01:06 - is false which it is so it will set
01:09 - random on to true else it will
01:12 - still stay false forever if random on
01:16 - equals true
01:17 - so if we type random it will time and
01:20 - pick random
01:21 - zero to ten thousands it can like be
01:24 - date and night and like faster
01:26 - else time at zero so it's still like
01:29 - stop time
01:30 - and you can choose the weather there's
01:32 - three of them you can clear the sky
01:35 - with clear sky in the chat rain
01:40 - and thunder now let's see the pine pond
01:46 - so the python is just

02:31 - the time adding isn't very fast
02:34 - but it can be very fast yeah so if we
02:37 - type random again it will drop the time
02:41 - it will stop the time when you press
02:43 - enter and what time was it
02:45 - and it will stop at that time let's type
02:47 - random again
