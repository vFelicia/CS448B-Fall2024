00:03 - andrew today is
00:05 - andrea's account starter scratch so
00:07 - today i'm going to show you my game
00:08 - called two-player dinosaur run okay
00:11 - first there are two players jump over
00:13 - the dinosaur so i am the green dinosaur
00:16 - i'm the oh
00:18 - player one
00:20 - am i player one your player one oh
00:22 - because your house has stopped i'm
00:24 - always so first there's player one which
00:26 - is the green diamond
00:28 - what's
00:30 - yeah the green t-x so when the code is
00:32 - when up arrow key pressed now change y
00:34 - by 160 so go up wait one second and
00:38 - change y by negative 160 so go back down
00:41 - so it can't so the dinosaurs which you
00:43 - have to jump and avoid as like obstacles
00:47 - will go past you
00:49 - you avoid this the one the red one
00:51 - the
00:53 - the bluish green one and the
00:55 - voice i'll say
00:57 - so when greenfield click don't go it's
00:59 - regular position the starting position
01:01 - for the
01:02 - for the player ones which is a t-rex
01:04 - because the players are the t-rex and
01:06 - they'll set the player one health which
01:09 - is variable so three so that's your like
01:11 - your lies and player two health tough
01:13 - three okay so when green flag clicked oh
01:16 - forever loop if touching enemy one which
01:19 - is touching any of the enemies which is
01:22 - the only one
01:23 - up enemy one now change player health by
01:26 - negative one so lose one health and then
01:29 - wait two seconds so it won't like get
01:31 - your health
01:32 - way down so fast so it's basically the
01:36 - same code for player two
01:40 - and here there's code when green flat
01:42 - clicked it'll forever if player one
01:44 - houses
01:45 - players
01:47 - variable health is zero you know stop
01:49 - also you can't just care about your own
