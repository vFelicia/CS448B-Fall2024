00:00 - welcome to coding with kids my name is
00:04 - andrew general miranda education today
00:06 - i'm going to show you my coding project
00:08 - called
00:09 - iron golem via zombie so which is
00:12 - basically um gladiator project and um
00:15 - microsoft made code but i changed it a
00:17 - little so on chat command arena so when
00:20 - you type arena in chat
00:22 - it'll build that teleport to play our
00:24 - world position so where you are in the
00:26 - world and the ability to move back by 10
00:30 - and then builder will move right by 10
00:32 - blocks now
00:34 - the builder will place a mark and then
00:37 - where p four times able to move forward
00:39 - by 20 and build a turn left so it'll do
00:42 - this four times so here when it does
00:44 - build up builder move forward by 20 and
00:47 - builder turn left it's basically making
00:49 - one side of the um cage or like
00:53 - um
00:55 - yeah arena where the iron golem will be
00:57 - fighting the zombies and they'll build a
01:00 - raised wall for mark with
01:02 - um
01:03 - we'll use polished and the site
01:05 - of five so it'll do five bucks high and
01:09 - it'll do the wall here in the repeat
01:11 - four because it placed the mark before
01:13 - it did the repeat four times in the
01:15 - building move so after it makes the
01:17 - arena they'll repeat 50 times to spawn
01:20 - monster zombie at zero zero zero so
01:23 - basically where you are standing then
01:26 - you can spawn the zombies and then you
01:28 - can um make iron golems to fight them
01:33 - okay so now let's see it in python
01:37 - so def on a chassis is a function
01:40 - builder.teleport to player position to
01:42 - teleport to
01:44 - the builder and then the builder will
01:46 - move back 10 blocks
01:48 - then it will move right to 10 blocks the
01:50 - builder that place marks so place a mark
01:54 - for the wall and then four index range
01:56 - four so repeat four times builder that
01:59 - move forward twenty and then builder
02:01 - that's her
02:02 - left turn so it will like go the other
02:05 - way to put the other side yeah another
02:08 - wall of the arena and then builder that
02:10 - range wall polished and site five blocks
02:13 - so i'll make the walls
02:15 - and then for index two in range fifty so
02:17 - repeat fifty times mob dot
02:21 - [Music]
02:33 - let's just stop
02:34 - right
02:35 - [Music]
02:46 - the zombies will probably um disappear
02:49 - before the iron golem can attack
02:51 - um
02:52 - all these days i'm gonna go to settings
02:56 - and do
02:57 - [Music]
02:58 - um
03:00 - not always day so now we're to do
03:04 - change
03:06 - time
03:07 - to night
03:11 - arena
03:17 - okay that's 50 that's quite quick oh
03:20 - there's a baby zombie with um
03:23 - full golden
03:25 - armor a baby
03:27 - i don't know i just saw it so i'm just
03:29 - gonna place um light so you can see
03:33 - more clear
03:36 - to this dark
03:38 - this oh this is not baby zombie
03:41 - clunching onto it's mama oh well it's
03:44 - apparent and um there's a zombie with a
03:48 - full
03:49 - email and an enchanted subject yeah so i
03:53 - recommend you to do this on flat world
03:56 - because here's uneven
03:58 - baby
04:05 - [Music]
04:13 - yeah and then here there's a chainmail
04:15 - on helmet and then there's a
04:17 - sword and another shovel by a regular
04:19 - circle the other ones are mostly just
04:22 - regular zombies this one is the most
04:24 - lucky yeah
04:26 - lucky
04:39 - [Music]
04:41 - angola three against fifties yes
04:45 - forty nine that's one of the biggest
05:02 - [Music]
05:04 - i'm
05:16 - that one is cornered in a corner
05:19 - cornered in the corner this one is oh oh
05:22 - no one of them unfailed
05:26 - now this one is trapped in the corner
05:29 - yeah two isn't it three i think i need
05:32 - four maybe
05:33 - okay still about thirty no i'm just
05:36 - gonna spawn one for now
05:39 - wow they hit the chain the one with the
05:40 - chainmail
05:42 - yeah but not the full chain my arm right
05:44 - yeah it's the same treatment armor still
05:46 - over here
05:47 - it's in the middle of the crowd yeah
05:50 - some of them pick up the rotten flesh
05:52 - yeah
05:53 - one of them has a days now it's cornered
05:56 - okay four
05:57 - i think i'll take five
05:59 - i think it's gonna take six
06:02 - six yeah i think that's too much sesame
06:05 - yeah six is in
06:07 - six for fifty zombies yeah
06:10 - six
06:11 - okay that's reasonable
06:14 - so the angle has a little advantage
06:16 - because it has
06:18 - um ball damage
06:22 - oh yeah one of the
06:24 - enchanted shovels
06:26 - now it's cornered and
06:28 - the zombies also have their own
06:30 - advantage because they
06:31 - corner the iron golem and push it back
06:35 - okay so this is our fifth okay go
06:39 - there's still like 25
06:41 - around 25.
06:44 - this one's a lot i
06:46 - got
06:48 - yeah so the iron bomb gets disadvantaged
06:51 - when the zombie hits doesn't um
06:54 - disappear but then it just
06:57 - when the iron color is
06:59 - attacked yeah because its target is at a
07:02 - beach i saw the baby zombie also
07:04 - attacking from its parent okay six
07:08 - okay
07:09 - i changed my mind seven
07:11 - eight eight
07:13 - how about you
07:14 - i think
07:16 - seven no eight
07:18 - yeah this is still a little too much for
07:20 - the eye
07:21 - [Music]
07:22 - it won't take ten
07:25 - i'm telling you it won't take ten
07:28 - oh no it got cornered again
07:33 - the fall damage isn't enough
07:35 - yeah okay this is our
07:39 - eighth right
07:40 - yeah
07:42 - no this is
07:50 - oh no
07:51 - no he's still here yeah
07:54 - this target is
07:58 - there are a lot of zombies that they're
07:59 - pushing it
08:02 - sometimes it changes
08:05 - [Music]
08:17 - [Music]
08:18 - it's actually pretty hard to just defeat
08:24 - [Music]
08:44 - yeah it's on on the top of the wall now
08:47 - i'm gonna let it down
08:52 - [Music]
08:57 - okay so we have one two three four five
08:59 - six seven eight eight more zombies this
09:02 - is our ninth so we only need nine
09:05 - nine
09:06 - [Music]
09:11 - zombies actually barely do any damage
09:14 - and it's like one oh yeah one or two
09:16 - hitting okay okay
09:18 - five more four more
09:22 - [Music]
09:34 - finally that's a lot nine you need to
09:38 - use nine to just defeat fifty
09:40 - uh under what took eighteen yeah so but
09:44 - i think our girls had a disadvantage
09:46 - because we didn't spawn them all at once
09:48 - yes
09:51 - i think they're going to complete it
09:53 - very fast yeah okay well that was fun
09:57 - and that's it for today thank you for
09:59 - watching remember to smash the like
10:01 - button and subscribe bye bye
