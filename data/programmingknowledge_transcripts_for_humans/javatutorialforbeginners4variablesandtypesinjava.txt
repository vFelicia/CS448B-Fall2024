00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - what are variables and how we can use
00:10 - variables in Java so first of all what
00:14 - are
00:15 - variables variables are nothing but
00:20 - names which we can declare to store some
00:25 - value okay so a variable is nothing but
00:29 - un name which we can use to store some
00:34 - value okay and in Java uh there is a
00:41 - specified format to declare a variable
00:45 - so for example if you want to declare a
00:48 - variable in Java in this main method we
00:53 - will go here inside our main method and
00:56 - in here we will declare a variable like
00:58 - this so first of all goes the data type
01:03 - data type uh can be for example uh the
01:07 - type of variable we are going to declare
01:10 - for example we want to uh
01:13 - store integer in some variable then we
01:18 - can declare this data type int which uh
01:22 - stands for integer and then you can give
01:26 - any name to the variable for example X
01:29 - and then you can assign some value to
01:33 - this variable for example 10 okay and
01:39 - this simply means that X is a variable
01:45 - of type
01:47 - integer which has a value of 10 okay so
01:53 - X in this case is our
01:56 - variable okay and variable
02:00 - are nothing but the names which can
02:05 - store some values okay so this
02:09 - definition is true for us now to print
02:13 - uh any variable for example we want to
02:15 - print uh the value of x we can directly
02:19 - use our variable like this so we just
02:22 - use
02:24 - system.out.print line and instead of uh
02:27 - printing some message you can just print
02:30 - x value of x here and when you run this
02:33 - uh
02:35 - program it will
02:37 - print 10 here right you can also give uh
02:42 - some uh uh you know uh Innovative uh
02:47 - name so so that uh you can understand it
02:51 - for example my or
02:58 - my ready variable okay so it's it
03:03 - depends upon you what name you want to
03:05 - give to your variable and then you can
03:09 - assign value to it but the format will
03:12 - always be the same first the type data
03:17 - type of your
03:19 - variable second here is the name and
03:23 - then whatever value you want to assign
03:26 - to your variable okay now in in uh Java
03:30 - there are different type of data types
03:33 - like we have declared a variable of type
03:37 - integer but there are different type of
03:39 - data type which we can
03:42 - declare and some of the most basic uh
03:45 - data types are I'm going to show you how
03:49 - uh they are
03:50 - declared so these are some of the basic
03:53 - data types first is a bite variable and
03:59 - and bite short and int and long all can
04:05 - store a number but the only difference
04:09 - between this bite short int and long is
04:14 - their size so bite can store one bite a
04:18 - short can store two bytes a integer can
04:22 - store four bytes and a long can store8
04:27 - bytes so the size differs in this case
04:31 - okay so you can uh do something like
04:34 - this bite my variable is equal to 10
04:38 - also right or you can also do a short my
04:43 - variable is equal to 10
04:47 - right so a bite can be uh the range of
04:51 - bite can be minus 128 to + 127 for
04:57 - example and for example for short the
05:00 - range can be minus
05:04 - 32,000 or something like this so the
05:07 - range of these uh
05:10 - increases uh in the ascending order so
05:14 - smallest is the bite then the short then
05:17 - the int and then the long okay and all
05:21 - can store the
05:22 - numbers now to store some decimal point
05:26 - value we use float for example uh we
05:30 - want to uh store some decimal value we
05:33 - will write a data type called float and
05:38 - my for
05:42 - example
05:44 - decimal is equal to
05:50 - 4.5
05:52 - right and this will store a decimal
05:56 - value but the problem with uh uh a
06:00 - declaration of float in this case is you
06:03 - need to declare float something like uh
06:07 - this in
06:09 - Java because this
06:11 - 4.5 is natively considered as a double
06:16 - and double can also store a a decimal
06:19 - point but its range is 8 by okay so
06:25 - that's why we need to uh convert this
06:28 - double value which is 4.5 to the float
06:32 - value and the difference between this
06:35 - float and double value is float is 4
06:39 - bytes and this double is 8 by okay and
06:44 - in the same way you can declare
06:47 - a double
06:50 - value double can also store some decimal
06:54 - points for example
06:58 - 11.5 six but in the case of uh double so
07:04 - double can be declared
07:07 - as double data type okay so in the case
07:12 - of double you don't need to add this
07:14 - line This float in the bracket means we
07:19 - are typ casting the double value to the
07:23 - float value and that we will uh discuss
07:26 - in the further videos what is Type
07:29 - casting of
07:30 - values the other data type is a
07:35 - care
07:42 - so a care value can store a character
07:47 - okay so for example you want to store
07:49 - Capital a or any single character then
07:53 - you store in car value okay and the last
07:58 - basic data type is is a Boolean Boolean
08:02 - can
08:02 - [Music]
08:04 - store uh
08:07 - is true for example data type name
08:11 - Boolean can store true or false so it
08:15 - can be true
08:18 - or false
08:21 - okay so these are some of the basic uh
08:26 - data types in uh Java
08:30 - and these are the example how you can
08:34 - declare a variable in Java and all these
08:39 - variable you can print something like
08:42 - this so let's print all the variable
08:45 - first of all we will print uh my
08:48 - variable second my
08:51 - decimal third is my double fourth is the
08:56 - character and fifth is this Boolean
08:59 - value and let's compile the program and
09:01 - run it and now the result is something
09:05 - like this so the first uh line shows 10
09:11 - so my variable contains the value 10
09:14 - that's why it's printed 10 then the
09:17 - decimal value we are printing which is
09:20 - 4.5 then this double value which is uh
09:25 - 1.5 uh
09:27 - 11.56 then we have printed this
09:30 - character value which is a which is true
09:33 - and then we have printed the value of
09:36 - this volan Boolean which is false okay
09:40 - so these are some of the basic uh data
09:44 - types and how we can declare variables
09:48 - and use
09:49 - variables uh in Java so I hope you have
09:52 - enjoyed this video please wrate comment
09:54 - and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what are variables and how we can use variables in Java so first of all what are variables variables are nothing but names which we can declare to store some value okay so a variable is nothing but un name which we can use to store some value okay and in Java uh there is a specified format to declare a variable so for example if you want to declare a variable in Java in this main method we will go here inside our main method and in here we will declare a variable like this so first of all goes the data type data type uh can be for example uh the type of variable we are going to declare for example we want to uh store integer in some variable then we can declare this data type int which uh stands for integer and then you can give any name to the variable for example X and then you can assign some value to this variable for example 10 okay and this simply means that X is a variable of type integer which has a value of 10 okay so X in this case is our variable okay and variable are nothing but the names which can store some values okay so this definition is true for us now to print uh any variable for example we want to print uh the value of x we can directly use our variable like this so we just use system.out.print line and instead of uh printing some message you can just print x value of x here and when you run this uh program it will print 10 here right you can also give uh some uh uh you know uh Innovative uh name so so that uh you can understand it for example my or my ready variable okay so it's it depends upon you what name you want to give to your variable and then you can assign value to it but the format will always be the same first the type data type of your variable second here is the name and then whatever value you want to assign to your variable okay now in in uh Java there are different type of data types like we have declared a variable of type integer but there are different type of data type which we can declare and some of the most basic uh data types are I'm going to show you how uh they are declared so these are some of the basic data types first is a bite variable and and bite short and int and long all can store a number but the only difference between this bite short int and long is their size so bite can store one bite a short can store two bytes a integer can store four bytes and a long can store8 bytes so the size differs in this case okay so you can uh do something like this bite my variable is equal to 10 also right or you can also do a short my variable is equal to 10 right so a bite can be uh the range of bite can be minus 128 to + 127 for example and for example for short the range can be minus 32,000 or something like this so the range of these uh increases uh in the ascending order so smallest is the bite then the short then the int and then the long okay and all can store the numbers now to store some decimal point value we use float for example uh we want to uh store some decimal value we will write a data type called float and my for example decimal is equal to 4.5 right and this will store a decimal value but the problem with uh uh a declaration of float in this case is you need to declare float something like uh this in Java because this 4.5 is natively considered as a double and double can also store a a decimal point but its range is 8 by okay so that's why we need to uh convert this double value which is 4.5 to the float value and the difference between this float and double value is float is 4 bytes and this double is 8 by okay and in the same way you can declare a double value double can also store some decimal points for example 11.5 six but in the case of uh double so double can be declared as double data type okay so in the case of double you don't need to add this line This float in the bracket means we are typ casting the double value to the float value and that we will uh discuss in the further videos what is Type casting of values the other data type is a care so a care value can store a character okay so for example you want to store Capital a or any single character then you store in car value okay and the last basic data type is is a Boolean Boolean can store uh is true for example data type name Boolean can store true or false so it can be true or false okay so these are some of the basic uh data types in uh Java and these are the example how you can declare a variable in Java and all these variable you can print something like this so let's print all the variable first of all we will print uh my variable second my decimal third is my double fourth is the character and fifth is this Boolean value and let's compile the program and run it and now the result is something like this so the first uh line shows 10 so my variable contains the value 10 that's why it's printed 10 then the decimal value we are printing which is 4.5 then this double value which is uh 1.5 uh 11.56 then we have printed this character value which is a which is true and then we have printed the value of this volan Boolean which is false okay so these are some of the basic uh data types and how we can declare variables and use variables uh in Java so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
