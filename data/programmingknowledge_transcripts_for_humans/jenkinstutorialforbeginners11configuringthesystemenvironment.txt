With timestamps:

00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video in
00:02 - Jenkins to total beginners in this video
00:05 - we will see how to do some of the basic
00:07 - configurations in cheng keynes using a
00:11 - section called configure system in many
00:14 - jenkins so when i click on manage
00:17 - jenkins there is a section called
00:19 - configure system and here we can do some
00:23 - of the basic configurations about
00:26 - jenkins so we will start from the top
00:29 - the first option here is home directory
00:32 - and you will see the location of your
00:36 - shangkun's home directory in the file
00:40 - system so when I copy this path and when
00:43 - I open the terminal and I will see t2
00:46 - this part you will be able to see all
00:50 - the you know configurations file or
00:54 - Jenkins related files are present inside
00:57 - this directory so you will see config
01:00 - dot XML file you will see job's
01:03 - directories nodes directories plugins
01:06 - directory is where all the plugins will
01:09 - be installed or the users directory and
01:12 - the workspace directory so all the
01:15 - configurations related to Jenkins you
01:19 - can do here and when I click on this
01:22 - question mark here beside this option
01:25 - you will be able to see more information
01:28 - about this option so by default
01:30 - Jenkins stores all of its data in this
01:34 - directory on the file system there are
01:37 - few ways to change the Jenkins home
01:39 - directory so this is the procedure which
01:41 - is given here to change the home
01:43 - directory of this Jenkins so if you have
01:46 - the good reason to change it you can
01:48 - follow these instructions to change the
01:51 - home directory now second option here is
01:54 - system message so this is the message
01:57 - you can show on the home page of Jenkins
02:01 - so for example I can just write some
02:05 - message here this is my Jenkins home
02:10 - page let's say ok
02:13 - and I will just save this option and
02:16 - when I save this option you will be able
02:18 - to see this message is displayed on the
02:22 - top of your home page above all the
02:26 - Jenkins job so I will once again go to
02:29 - the configure system and this system
02:32 - message also supports the HTML tags now
02:36 - you can see a little section here it
02:39 - says plain text this is the support
02:42 - format which this box will support now
02:47 - we can change it to support the HTML so
02:50 - for that we need to go to the manage
02:53 - Jenkins option once again and then go to
02:56 - the configure global security and inside
02:59 - the configure global security you will
03:01 - be able to find a section called markup
03:06 - for meta and by default it's plain text
03:09 - here selected we can choose the safe
03:11 - HTML here and then we can just save this
03:15 - option and once you save this option we
03:20 - can just refresh this configure page and
03:23 - now you will see here safe hTML is
03:27 - displayed here so this is the default
03:30 - format which this message will support
03:34 - so for example now I can use the HTML
03:37 - tags here for example I want to just
03:40 - show this message in h1 tag so I can
03:45 - just use this h1 tag here h1 and then I
03:49 - can preview this message from here so I
03:52 - can just click here and this message
03:54 - will be displayed like this on my home
03:57 - page let me save it and let's verify
03:59 - this so you can see it's shown in the h1
04:02 - tags now this system message so this is
04:07 - how you can just display the system
04:10 - message here now the next option here is
04:12 - the number of executors and for example
04:17 - this number is 2 by default that means
04:20 - that 2 jobs can run parallely on this
04:25 - Jenkins right if
04:27 - I can change it to five then it will
04:30 - allow the five jobs to run parallely so
04:33 - you can change this number from here
04:35 - number of executors the next option is
04:38 - labels this is a little bit detailed
04:41 - concept when we use the master slave
04:45 - concept and nodes we will see how to use
04:48 - labels so I'm going to leave this for
04:51 - now we will see how labels work in the
04:54 - future lectures now the next section
04:58 - here is the usage and by default the
05:01 - usage here is used this node as much as
05:05 - possible because we only have one
05:08 - Jenkins node which is this node that's
05:12 - why the default option is use this node
05:15 - as much as possible but when we will
05:18 - learn how to create nodes and how to
05:20 - provide labels to our nodes then later
05:25 - we will be able to choose this option
05:27 - which says only build jobs with labels
05:30 - expression matching this node so this we
05:33 - will learn later when we will see how to
05:36 - create nodes and how to assign labels to
05:39 - our nodes so for now I will leave it as
05:42 - default for more information you can
05:45 - just click on this question mark and you
05:48 - will see some more description about
05:51 - this usage section so controls how
05:55 - jenkins schedules built on this node ok
05:59 - so you can read more about this option
06:02 - here now the next option is the quite
06:06 - period now the quiet period it's in
06:09 - second I am going to just click on the
06:11 - question mark once again and here it
06:15 - says when this option is checked newly
06:18 - triggered Bills of this project will be
06:21 - added to the queue but the Jenkins will
06:24 - wait for the specified period of time
06:27 - before actually starting the bill so
06:30 - Jenkins will be it for example for five
06:33 - seconds before starting this build so
06:36 - sometimes for example you use the source
06:39 - code management system and
06:41 - you're committing will take some time
06:44 - all you when you push your code it takes
06:47 - some time to you know get into your
06:51 - github repository or for any other
06:53 - reason for example your jobs takes some
06:57 - time to start you can specify this quiet
07:00 - period here so that your jobs or your
07:04 - build will start after the specified
07:07 - periods so by default it's 5:00 but you
07:11 - can change it in future when you feel
07:13 - that your Jenkins will need more time to
07:16 - start so just provide the quiet period
07:20 - here this will be in second so after
07:22 - five second your build will start after
07:26 - the triggering of this job now the next
07:30 - option here is SCM checkout retry count
07:33 - so this is the option where for example
07:37 - you are using your SCM source code
07:41 - management system let me go to the home
07:43 - page and let me show you one example so
07:46 - I will go into one Jenkins job here and
07:50 - I will go to the configuration section
07:52 - here and then I will scroll down for the
07:57 - bill triggers and you will see pol SCM
08:01 - option here so when I select this pol
08:03 - SCM or a github hook trigger for gates
08:07 - HCM polling then this is the option for
08:12 - number of tries so this Jenkins will try
08:16 - to connect to your github for example
08:20 - this much number of times right now it's
08:23 - zero but for example you set it to 5
08:26 - then Jenkins will try five time to
08:29 - connect to your github before giving or
08:33 - showing some error now the next option
08:35 - is restrict project naming so let's see
08:39 - this option also so by default it's
08:41 - default now you can choose the pattern
08:45 - option here or you can choose a role
08:49 - based strategy option here also so let's
08:52 - see what this pattern option do
08:54 - so I'm going to click on this question
08:56 - mark and you can see some description
08:58 - here it says define a pattern or a
09:01 - regular expression to check whether the
09:04 - job name is valid or not
09:06 - so for example I define some pattern
09:09 - here for the naming of my chenkin job so
09:13 - let's say I define Java dot Asterix that
09:16 - means my Jenkins job which I will be
09:19 - able to create will start from Java and
09:23 - not any other keyword so let me save
09:27 - this option and once this is saved let
09:30 - me try to create a new Jenkins job and
09:33 - let's say I just you know give some name
09:38 - here and instantly you will see this
09:40 - message which says Deb does not match
09:43 - the job name convention pattern which is
09:46 - Java dot estwick which means that your
09:50 - Jenkins job name should start with this
09:52 - Java keyword so let's say I will just
09:55 - start the name with Java keyword and now
09:58 - I can see that there is no warning here
10:01 - okay any other pattern it's going to
10:04 - show this warning here okay so this
10:08 - pattern option you can use to give some
10:12 - kind of pattern for the naming for now I
10:15 - will just choose it as default so I'm
10:19 - going to just revert it back to the
10:23 - default option but if you want you can
10:26 - just change it to anything you want in
10:30 - the future okay now next section here is
10:34 - the global properties and in the global
10:37 - properties you will see two options here
10:40 - one is environment variables so here you
10:42 - can give all the environment variables
10:44 - which you want to give to your Jenkins
10:47 - job globally for example so let's say I
10:51 - want to give let's say Java home
10:54 - environment variable I can give it from
10:57 - here so I can give the value of this
11:00 - Java home environment variable and the
11:03 - name from here okay or any other
11:07 - variable which you want to use in your
11:09 - champions job execution you can give it
11:13 - from here now the next option here is
11:16 - the tool location so this is the tool
11:21 - location so for example you want to use
11:23 - some tool let's say get so the binary
11:26 - apart for this gate you can give it from
11:31 - here now the next section here is the
11:33 - pipeline speed durability settings and
11:37 - this we will see in future videos I'm
11:40 - going to skip this section for now and
11:42 - then you have the usage statistics
11:44 - option which will help make Jenkins
11:48 - better by sending the anonymous usage
11:50 - statistics and crash reports to the
11:54 - chain keynes project so if you want this
11:56 - option you can check it or uncheck it
11:59 - according to your needs and then next
12:02 - section is the time Stamper system clock
12:04 - time format and elapsed time format this
12:08 - is the format which a Jenkins will
12:11 - support but you can see in the details
12:14 - you can support any other format which
12:17 - is given here so here you can just
12:21 - define the time format which you want to
12:24 - show now in the next section you will be
12:27 - able to see the chenkin location before
12:30 - that there is administrative monitor
12:33 - configuration and you will be able to
12:36 - see this option which says enable
12:39 - administrative monitoring and here you
12:42 - can see administrative monitoring are
12:44 - the warnings shown to Jenkins
12:47 - administrator about the state of Jenkins
12:50 - interface so you can check these option
12:53 - whatever warning you want to see so for
12:55 - example you want to see the dependency
12:58 - warning or you want to see the invalid
13:00 - plug-in warning or if you want to see
13:03 - the disk usage spawning all the warnings
13:05 - you can set up from here by default
13:08 - every warning is selected but let's say
13:11 - if you want to skip some warning you can
13:13 - just uncheck this option and then this
13:16 - warning will not be shown to you let's
13:19 - go to the next
13:21 - in here which is the chenkin location by
13:24 - default we are using the localhost but
13:27 - you can give any host name instead of
13:30 - this local host now next option is the
13:34 - admin email address you can provide your
13:37 - admin email address here and then you
13:40 - have the github server options so if you
13:43 - want to add some keys for your github
13:47 - server you can provide those keys or you
13:51 - can give the name of your guitars over
13:54 - here and then provide the github servers
13:57 - credentials from here we will see this
14:00 - later how we can do it and then you have
14:04 - that github enterprise server so if you
14:07 - are using some private servers to host
14:09 - your repositories like github private
14:12 - repository then you can add the
14:16 - information about that here now the next
14:18 - section is the pipeline model definition
14:20 - this we will see when we will see the
14:23 - pipeline's how pipelines works then you
14:26 - have the built in mouth plugin option so
14:29 - whatever plugin you have just installed
14:31 - or whatever plugins there is in your
14:34 - rankings there are some options you can
14:38 - set for those plugins here for example
14:41 - so get plug-in or subversion plug-in
14:44 - shell plug-in extend email notification
14:48 - plug-in and any other you know
14:51 - information you can give it here so you
14:54 - have the email notification SMTP server
14:58 - configuration you can do it from here so
15:01 - these are some of the basic
15:03 - configuration you can do for your
15:07 - champions as an administrator so I hope
15:10 - you have enjoyed this video please
15:10 - recommend subscribe and bye for now

hey guys welcome to the next video in Jenkins to total beginners in this video we will see how to do some of the basic configurations in cheng keynes using a section called configure system in many jenkins so when i click on manage jenkins there is a section called configure system and here we can do some of the basic configurations about jenkins so we will start from the top the first option here is home directory and you will see the location of your shangkun's home directory in the file system so when I copy this path and when I open the terminal and I will see t2 this part you will be able to see all the you know configurations file or Jenkins related files are present inside this directory so you will see config dot XML file you will see job's directories nodes directories plugins directory is where all the plugins will be installed or the users directory and the workspace directory so all the configurations related to Jenkins you can do here and when I click on this question mark here beside this option you will be able to see more information about this option so by default Jenkins stores all of its data in this directory on the file system there are few ways to change the Jenkins home directory so this is the procedure which is given here to change the home directory of this Jenkins so if you have the good reason to change it you can follow these instructions to change the home directory now second option here is system message so this is the message you can show on the home page of Jenkins so for example I can just write some message here this is my Jenkins home page let's say ok and I will just save this option and when I save this option you will be able to see this message is displayed on the top of your home page above all the Jenkins job so I will once again go to the configure system and this system message also supports the HTML tags now you can see a little section here it says plain text this is the support format which this box will support now we can change it to support the HTML so for that we need to go to the manage Jenkins option once again and then go to the configure global security and inside the configure global security you will be able to find a section called markup for meta and by default it's plain text here selected we can choose the safe HTML here and then we can just save this option and once you save this option we can just refresh this configure page and now you will see here safe hTML is displayed here so this is the default format which this message will support so for example now I can use the HTML tags here for example I want to just show this message in h1 tag so I can just use this h1 tag here h1 and then I can preview this message from here so I can just click here and this message will be displayed like this on my home page let me save it and let's verify this so you can see it's shown in the h1 tags now this system message so this is how you can just display the system message here now the next option here is the number of executors and for example this number is 2 by default that means that 2 jobs can run parallely on this Jenkins right if I can change it to five then it will allow the five jobs to run parallely so you can change this number from here number of executors the next option is labels this is a little bit detailed concept when we use the master slave concept and nodes we will see how to use labels so I'm going to leave this for now we will see how labels work in the future lectures now the next section here is the usage and by default the usage here is used this node as much as possible because we only have one Jenkins node which is this node that's why the default option is use this node as much as possible but when we will learn how to create nodes and how to provide labels to our nodes then later we will be able to choose this option which says only build jobs with labels expression matching this node so this we will learn later when we will see how to create nodes and how to assign labels to our nodes so for now I will leave it as default for more information you can just click on this question mark and you will see some more description about this usage section so controls how jenkins schedules built on this node ok so you can read more about this option here now the next option is the quite period now the quiet period it's in second I am going to just click on the question mark once again and here it says when this option is checked newly triggered Bills of this project will be added to the queue but the Jenkins will wait for the specified period of time before actually starting the bill so Jenkins will be it for example for five seconds before starting this build so sometimes for example you use the source code management system and you're committing will take some time all you when you push your code it takes some time to you know get into your github repository or for any other reason for example your jobs takes some time to start you can specify this quiet period here so that your jobs or your build will start after the specified periods so by default it's 500 but you can change it in future when you feel that your Jenkins will need more time to start so just provide the quiet period here this will be in second so after five second your build will start after the triggering of this job now the next option here is SCM checkout retry count so this is the option where for example you are using your SCM source code management system let me go to the home page and let me show you one example so I will go into one Jenkins job here and I will go to the configuration section here and then I will scroll down for the bill triggers and you will see pol SCM option here so when I select this pol SCM or a github hook trigger for gates HCM polling then this is the option for number of tries so this Jenkins will try to connect to your github for example this much number of times right now it's zero but for example you set it to 5 then Jenkins will try five time to connect to your github before giving or showing some error now the next option is restrict project naming so let's see this option also so by default it's default now you can choose the pattern option here or you can choose a role based strategy option here also so let's see what this pattern option do so I'm going to click on this question mark and you can see some description here it says define a pattern or a regular expression to check whether the job name is valid or not so for example I define some pattern here for the naming of my chenkin job so let's say I define Java dot Asterix that means my Jenkins job which I will be able to create will start from Java and not any other keyword so let me save this option and once this is saved let me try to create a new Jenkins job and let's say I just you know give some name here and instantly you will see this message which says Deb does not match the job name convention pattern which is Java dot estwick which means that your Jenkins job name should start with this Java keyword so let's say I will just start the name with Java keyword and now I can see that there is no warning here okay any other pattern it's going to show this warning here okay so this pattern option you can use to give some kind of pattern for the naming for now I will just choose it as default so I'm going to just revert it back to the default option but if you want you can just change it to anything you want in the future okay now next section here is the global properties and in the global properties you will see two options here one is environment variables so here you can give all the environment variables which you want to give to your Jenkins job globally for example so let's say I want to give let's say Java home environment variable I can give it from here so I can give the value of this Java home environment variable and the name from here okay or any other variable which you want to use in your champions job execution you can give it from here now the next option here is the tool location so this is the tool location so for example you want to use some tool let's say get so the binary apart for this gate you can give it from here now the next section here is the pipeline speed durability settings and this we will see in future videos I'm going to skip this section for now and then you have the usage statistics option which will help make Jenkins better by sending the anonymous usage statistics and crash reports to the chain keynes project so

Jenkins will support but you can see in the details you can support any other format which is given here so here you can just define the time format which you want to show now in the next section you will be able to see the chenkin location before that there is administrative monitor configuration and you will be able to see this option which says enable administrative monitoring and here you can see administrative monitoring are the warnings shown to Jenkins administrator about the state of Jenkins interface so you can check these option whatever warning you want to see so for example you want to see the dependency warning or you want to see the invalid plugin warning or if you want to see the disk usage spawning all the warnings you can set up from here by default every warning is selected but let's say if you want to skip some warning you can just uncheck this option and then this warning will not be shown to you let's go to the next in here which is the chenkin location by default we are using the localhost but you can give any host name instead of this local host now next option is the admin email address you can provide your admin email address here and then you have the github server options so if you want to add some keys for your github server you can provide those keys or you can give the name of your guitars over here and then provide the github servers
