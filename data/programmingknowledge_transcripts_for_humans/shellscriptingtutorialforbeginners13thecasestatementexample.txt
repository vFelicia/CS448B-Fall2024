00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tools for beginners in
00:04 - the last video we have seen how we can
00:06 - use the case statement in shell
00:09 - scripting now in this video we will take
00:11 - one more example on case statements and
00:15 - we will consolidate our knowledge which
00:17 - we have gained in the last video so we
00:20 - already know that how case statement
00:23 - works in scripting and this is the basic
00:26 - syntax which we have learned in the last
00:28 - video so let's take an example and this
00:32 - time we are going to use some pattern to
00:36 - evaluate some cases so let's say we want
00:41 - to allow the user to enter any character
00:44 - and then we will evaluate that character
00:49 - and based upon the character entered by
00:51 - the user we will display if it's a
00:54 - capital letter or a small letter or a
00:59 - integer or some other special character
01:03 - or it's not a character he entered some
01:07 - string for example so let's get started
01:10 - so what I am going to do is on the top I
01:13 - am going to ask the user to enter some
01:18 - character so I will just use - II for
01:22 - this and I will say enter some character
01:25 - and then we will allow the user to enter
01:28 - the character on the same line right and
01:31 - then we will take that character using
01:34 - the read command so just write read and
01:37 - then we will save it for example in a
01:40 - value so just try it value variable and
01:45 - then we will take this variable so I am
01:48 - going to remove this variable because we
01:50 - don't need this variable so now our
01:53 - character or whatever input is entered
01:56 - by the user is in the value variable so
02:00 - we will evaluate this value expression
02:03 - and then we will check if it's a capital
02:07 - letter or small letter right
02:10 - for that we can use some patterns now
02:14 - how pattern works so for example we want
02:16 - to evaluate if user has entered the
02:20 - small letter A to Z so we can may use
02:24 - this square bracket and then you just
02:26 - need to write a and then minus Z and
02:30 - this pattern represent that we are
02:34 - expecting a small letter between A to Z
02:39 - okay in a similar way if you want to
02:43 - evaluate a capital character then we can
02:48 - just say capital A to Z like this so
02:52 - this is the pattern for capital A to Z
02:54 - right now if you want to evaluate the
03:00 - number any integer 0 to 9 so we can just
03:03 - write 0 to 9 right now if the user
03:08 - enters any other special character for
03:11 - example Asterix or some other characters
03:14 - which is not the part of e to Z or any
03:19 - number then we can evaluate it with the
03:22 - question mark now what is question mark
03:25 - question mark is a pattern which expects
03:30 - any special character any character
03:34 - which is one letter character right and
03:38 - this asterisk or star symbol R waits for
03:43 - more than one character so it can be one
03:45 - on more than one special character so if
03:49 - the user enters for example any string
03:52 - and not a character then it goes into
03:55 - this situation or in this case and this
03:59 - is for only one character any special
04:02 - character right and here we can echo
04:06 - that character so for example user
04:10 - entered value and then we can just say A
04:14 - to Z smaller letters write in a similar
04:21 - way for capital A to Z
04:23 - can just right here capital a to Zed and
04:27 - in the case of integer let's copy this
04:30 - and paste it here and we will just say 0
04:34 - to 9 and in the case of question mark we
04:38 - will just say it's a special character
04:41 - right and in the last case we will just
04:43 - say unknown input so we will just write
04:47 - here unknown input so let's run the
04:51 - script and let's see what happens when
04:53 - we run this script let's run the script
04:57 - and let's enter any small letter for
05:01 - example app and then press Enter and say
05:05 - the user entered letter F which is
05:09 - between small a to small Z right once
05:14 - again let's run the script and this time
05:17 - we will enter the capital K for example
05:19 - and then press Enter and you can you see
05:23 - there is an error here because we were
05:28 - expecting this statement to be printed
05:31 - which is capital a to capital Z but here
05:35 - it prints user entered capital K but
05:38 - then it prints small a to Z so it goes
05:43 - into this condition and if you also get
05:47 - the same error then most probably you
05:50 - need to do a small hack and this is you
05:55 - just need to set the Lang as C so just
06:01 - write Lang is equal to C so in capital
06:06 - Lang is equal to capital C and this
06:09 - means you are setting a languor
06:12 - environment variable is equal to C right
06:15 - and this means that you are using the
06:20 - safe locale everywhere in your operating
06:23 - system so if it doesn't work for you for
06:26 - capital letter the script you just need
06:29 - to set this environment variable as C so
06:32 - lang is equal to C and once again we
06:35 - will run the script
06:36 - and once again we will enter the capital
06:38 - K and this time it shows the right
06:42 - result to us right so if you face the
06:45 - same problem just use this environment
06:48 - variable is equal to C right once again
06:51 - let's run the script and this time we
06:53 - will enter any number and press ENTER
06:56 - and says of course it's between zero to
06:59 - nine right or any other number for
07:02 - example five it's also between zero to
07:04 - nine right now let's enter any special
07:08 - character so I'm entering for example
07:11 - this and symbol which is a special
07:13 - character and then press Enter
07:15 - and it says user entered this and it's a
07:20 - special character now let's enter any
07:23 - random string and let's see what's the
07:26 - result so it says unknown input right so
07:31 - in this way you can match characters
07:34 - using these kind of patterns right for
07:39 - more information on patterns and regular
07:42 - expression you can always search for a
07:45 - regular expression and you will see a
07:48 - vicky pedia page on regular expression
07:51 - and you will be able to understand and
07:54 - read their what the square bracket is
07:57 - what is - what is this question mark
08:00 - stands for or what is this asterisk
08:03 - everything so the Wikipedia page for
08:06 - regular expression has a good
08:09 - explanation on pattern so just read that
08:12 - Wikipedia page and you will be able to
08:15 - understand these patterns in a better
08:18 - manner so case is not just used for our
08:23 - strict letters or characters you can you
08:27 - know evaluate any patterns using the
08:30 - case statement and that's the beauty of
08:32 - this case statement so I hope you
08:35 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
08:36 - subscribe and bye for now

hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tools for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use the case statement in shell scripting now in this video we will take one more example on case statements and we will consolidate our knowledge which we have gained in the last video so we already know that how case statement works in scripting and this is the basic syntax which we have learned in the last video so let's take an example and this time we are going to use some pattern to evaluate some cases so let's say we want to allow the user to enter any character and then we will evaluate that character and based upon the character entered by the user we will display if it's a capital letter or a small letter or a integer or some other special character or it's not a

save it for example in a value so just try it value variable and then we will take this variable so I am going to remove this variable because we don't need this variable so now our character or whatever input is entered by the user is in the value variable so we will evaluate this value expression and then we will check if it's a capital letter or small letter right for that we can use some patterns now how pattern works so for example we want to evaluate if user has entered the small letter A to Z so we can may use this square bracket and then you just need to write a and then minus Z and this pattern represent that we are expecting a small letter between A to Z okay in a similar way if you want to evaluate a capital character then we can just say capital A to Z like this so this is the pattern for capital A to Z right now if you want to evaluate the number any integer 0 to 9 so we can just write 0 to 9 right now if the user enters any other special character for example Asterix or some other characters which is not the part of e to Z or any number then we can evaluate it with the question mark now what is question mark question mark is a pattern which expects any special character any character which is one letter character right and this asterisk or star symbol R waits for more than one character so it can be one on more than one special character so if the

will just write here unknown input so let's run the script and let's see what happens when we run this script let's run the script and let's enter any small letter for example app and then press Enter and say the user entered letter F which is between small a to small Z right once again let's run the script and this time we will enter the capital K for example and then press Enter and you can you see there is an error here because we were expecting this statement to be printed which is capital a to capital Z but here it prints user entered capital K but then it prints small a to Z so it goes

is equal to capital C and this means you are setting a languor environment variable is equal to C right and this means that you are using the safe locale everywhere in your operating system so if it doesn't work for you for capital letter the script you just need to set this environment variable as C so lang is equal to C and once again we will run the script and once again we will enter the capital K and this time it shows the right result to us right so if you face the same problem just use this environment variable is equal to C right once again let's run the script and this time we will enter any number and press ENTER and says of course it's between zero to nine right or any other number for example five it's also between zero to nine right now let's enter any special character so I'm entering for example this and symbol which is a special character and then press Enter and it says user entered this and it's a special character now let's enter any random string and let's see what's the result so it says unknown input right so in this way you can match characters using these kind of patterns right for more information on patterns and regular expression you can always search for a regular expression and you will see a vicky pedia page on regular expression and you will be able to understand and read their what the square bracket is what is what is this question mark stands for or what is this asterisk everything so the Wikipedia page for regular expression has a good explanation on pattern so just read that Wikipedia page and you will be able to understand these patterns in a better manner so case is not just used for our strict letters or characters you can you know evaluate any patterns using the case statement and that's the beauty of this case statement so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
