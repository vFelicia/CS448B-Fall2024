00:00 - programming knowledge so again welcome
00:02 - you all to programming knowledge so this
00:05 - is the thirteenth tutorial over Jango
00:06 - series so like this is the github link
00:08 - of our stream you can clone this
00:11 - repository download on your local
00:12 - machine then run the project on your
00:14 - local machine so these are the
00:15 - instructions I have defined below so
00:18 - like in the previous tutorial we were
00:20 - working on forms so we had made a form
00:22 - using of using a form template engine
00:25 - engine Jiang Django so I had made a file
00:29 - named form short py and then I hadn't
00:32 - made a form so this is the look of our
00:34 - form then in use dot py file I defined
00:37 - two method one was it Lucas wrote method
00:40 - is equal to post and one was the cat so
00:43 - basically I give a quick overview of
00:45 - what we were going to do so like when i
00:48 - refresh this page so basically upon this
00:51 - URL
00:52 - I am making a get request and having at
00:55 - the get request so basically this block
00:58 - of code gets executed and this block of
01:01 - code gets executed and this tells that I
01:04 - had imported the form on the top of the
01:07 - file from dot form and port star you can
01:09 - input any form so when you use star
01:13 - symbol so I use form is equal to
01:16 - feedback form so this was a feedback
01:18 - form which I was referring to and then I
01:21 - was able to render this form on my on
01:23 - the front end part of my application
01:25 - okay so basically what we are going to
01:28 - do first thing we are going to do is add
01:30 - bootstrap class to this form so what you
01:33 - are going to do whenever your input is
01:35 - defined inside form short py file so you
01:38 - need to define a dictionary which has
01:40 - key value pairs so basically this
01:43 - dictionary is to define by attributes so
01:47 - am tt-rs
01:48 - is equal to this is a symbol for
01:50 - dictionary so it has a key PF okay
01:53 - basically the at the left it will have a
01:55 - keeping her key and then I found right
01:57 - if I have a value so basically these
01:59 - attributes could be anything which could
02:01 - be name ID class which refers to the
02:04 - basic HTML syntax to the follow so what
02:07 - i will do i define attribute class and i
02:11 - give it a value
02:13 - or form control or control so most of us
02:19 - would be thinking why we will form
02:20 - control as the class because this is a
02:22 - default class present in the bootstrap
02:24 - so this will make a form responsive and
02:26 - for the another text area I will do the
02:29 - same okay
02:31 - I'll basically quickly copy this yes
02:36 - yeah now this is fine so when I move to
02:39 - my page I would see a bootstrap has been
02:43 - added to my form yeah you can see the
02:45 - butcher had added to a form but this is
02:48 - this isn't responsive so what do we are
02:50 - going to do I'll go to my my form go to
02:53 - HTML and I'll add a div class is will
02:58 - call medium six and I put this form
03:05 - inside a div okay and I what I'm going
03:11 - to do okay to get the form on the middle
03:14 - of the page I'll define a style
03:16 - saidulu margin zero for - okay no this
03:22 - is fine yeah now this home is is in the
03:27 - center of the page now this is good to
03:29 - check this post in this I press ctrl
03:31 - shift I and yeah now this looks good
03:35 - okay there is some issue okay yeah it's
03:38 - fine okay now this is form is responsive
03:41 - okay so this all it is a front-end part
03:43 - no for the back in part what if I want
03:46 - to submit this form to submit this form
03:48 - the method should be post method okay
03:52 - and I generated token for this which
03:57 - says % c RF under scope token so token
04:02 - is necessary when I when you submit the
04:05 - form Y post method okay and this is a
04:09 - form which I had record and additionally
04:12 - I need a button also button type is able
04:16 - to submit loss is equal to VTN
04:20 - so this is a short form button primary
04:25 - this is a default bootstrap class and I
04:28 - give the back submit okay okay now this
04:33 - is fine and I'll when okay so here comes
04:38 - a button so I'll give it a little bit of
04:40 - styling to this button style is equal to
04:43 - margin zero or two
04:47 - yes okay okay
04:52 - it is it it is it it is not in the
04:54 - center so I add display:block okay and
05:00 - what I can do okay margin zero or two
05:04 - and zero for the bottom so what I'm
05:09 - going to do so this is a full hand
05:13 - rotation which says on the top I'll give
05:16 - one Ram and on the left and the right or
05:19 - two and on the bottom I'll give zero so
05:22 - this will give ya so it gives a margin
05:25 - top of one wrap and on the left and
05:27 - right because water and the bottom it
05:28 - was zero okay left and right auto top is
05:31 - one at the bottom is zero so this is
05:33 - pretty fine now so I'll make now I move
05:38 - to the back and card and what I told you
05:42 - when i refresh this page okay so I was
05:46 - making a get request on this route so
05:48 - when I made a get to pass on this router
05:51 - you can sit on tetrakis on this URL so
05:53 - the form had rendered but what if I make
05:55 - a post request when I would be making
05:58 - the post request and basically I would
05:59 - be submitting the form okay so when I'm
06:03 - going to submit the form so what I'm
06:04 - going to do I'll make form is able to
06:08 - feedback form request dot post okay
06:14 - sorry request what post so I get all the
06:18 - values when the form has been submitted
06:19 - using the post method okay okay but
06:23 - still I'll make a if condition to check
06:25 - form
06:27 - dot is underscore violin is underscore
06:34 - valid to make sure the form is valid and
06:36 - I'll make type
06:38 - is equal to request dot post and title
06:45 - tied dot del okay and subject so I'll
06:52 - make again a same request for the
06:54 - subject subject is equal to request dot
06:58 - post and subject okay now this was fine
07:05 - and I would print titles here and print
07:15 - subject here okay and I'll return an STD
07:18 - with bones okay but still I will make a
07:24 - is equal to STR form submitted
07:35 - I'll get plus STR request dot methods
07:43 - okay so this is find it here
07:46 - yeah now I will return an S et will
07:49 - spawn so we're okay if this form is not
07:55 - violate what I'm going to do so what I'm
08:01 - going to do I'm going to render the form
08:03 - again but okay and I define my
08:07 - dictionary is equal to this dictionary
08:10 - is going to be same as this one and you
08:12 - can see form and form okay and this is
08:23 - this as we copy this else now this looks
08:33 - fine this code I'll quickly
08:36 - give a quick overview if the request
08:41 - word method was get this cool this block
08:45 - of code gets executed in which it says
08:47 - I'll render the form on the front head
08:49 - part okay when I submit this
08:52 - so this block of code let's say we could
08:54 - execute which says request dot method is
08:57 - equal is equal to post so form is able
09:00 - to feed back home I get all the values
09:02 - using request or post if the form is
09:04 - valid then I'll get the two values that
09:06 - is subject and title then I print the
09:09 - title print the subject and I have given
09:11 - a name variable which says form
09:13 - submitted by the requested method and I
09:15 - will return the HTTP response of the
09:18 - world else in the form was not valid so
09:22 - you need to the touch check that if the
09:26 - form was not violated so I would render
09:28 - the form on the front head part again
09:30 - okay if the form was not valid so what
09:34 - I'm going to do it says I test app debug
09:46 - okay but okay before this I'll you start
09:50 - my server okay
09:55 - yeah that's fine okay I'll finish this
09:59 - page
09:59 - okay now when i refresh this page I made
10:02 - a cat request so I rendered the form of
10:05 - the front-end part so test I will give a
10:07 - title and say app develop I'll make now
10:12 - submit this form okay so I have
10:18 - submitted the form yeah now it says form
10:21 - submitted post so this was a method
10:23 - which I had defined so when I submit
10:26 - that in the form so this block of four
10:28 - gets executed and here you can see that
10:31 - I had executed two previous eight menhir
10:34 - one was a title and one was a subject so
10:36 - title corresponds to test and this hang
10:40 - it as a test was title and I've debug
10:42 - was there in my subject art so so thank
10:46 - you guys thank you so much I'll catch up
10:47 - in the next tutorial so you need to be
10:51 - very careful by the writing this code
10:53 - you need to be very careful about
10:54 - writing which if condition this comes
10:56 - inside which if then tells that hell if
10:59 - part so you need to have a quick you
11:02 - need to have a good
11:03 - overview on this so in the next current
11:06 - we are going to work how what happens if
11:08 - the user it's a form is not value of
