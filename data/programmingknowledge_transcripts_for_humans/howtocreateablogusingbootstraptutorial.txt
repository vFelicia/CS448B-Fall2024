00:01 - [Music]
00:12 - in this section we are going to create a
00:14 - blog um the blog is mostly uh created
00:18 - just have one page left and I am going
00:21 - to live code that page so what we're
00:23 - going to do in this section is we're
00:24 - going to walk through the code I'll show
00:26 - you some tricks that I used to create uh
00:29 - the block and then we are going to live
00:32 - code the contact me page because that
00:35 - page does not exist yet on that blog and
00:38 - this is the blog that uh we are going to
00:41 - work on so it is made on
00:44 - bootstrap and uh believe it or not this
00:48 - web page um took me like 120 custom CSS
00:53 - lines to create so mainly just boot up
00:56 - with some um small amount of custom CSS
01:00 - and we have a fully function block
01:03 - basically what I got here is just quotes
01:06 - from Albert Einstein and if we click on
01:09 - this link we'll get to uh the page with
01:14 - um like a block single post and um by
01:18 - the way this is the Red Riding Hood
01:20 - story or part of it and then we have
01:23 - about
01:24 - page which has some short um extract
01:28 - from the um Albert Einstein biography
01:31 - and then the homepage so we need a
01:34 - contact page and we're going to add that
01:36 - page in and the this is a very modern
01:39 - slick looking very clean uh blog made on
01:42 - boot shop and uses very small amount of
01:46 - custom CSS so in our next video we are
01:48 - going to walk through the code I'm going
01:50 - to show you how I did it what um options
01:53 - I've used what boost shop components I
01:55 - have used over here and hopefully you're
01:58 - going to learn a lot from from this
02:06 - project so in this video we are going to
02:09 - talk about the way I have done this
02:11 - website and the first off I think the
02:13 - most important aspect of creating a web
02:17 - page is um how you are structuring your
02:21 - SS um and I'll just want to take a brief
02:24 - moment and talk about um my partials and
02:28 - basically I have a global partial from
02:31 - the previous sections and then I have a
02:34 - header with some bootstop override and
02:38 - then I have a Blog
02:41 - archive a very small component for the
02:44 - blog archive blog archive is uh this
02:47 - part over
02:49 - here
02:50 - and uh after blog archive I have the
02:53 - page is for the blog uh single post and
02:57 - then I have the footer uh so not not a
03:00 - lot of code as you see and uh we get a
03:02 - pretty nice looking website from that
03:05 - and for the HTML markup I will go ahead
03:08 - and look at index. HTML and the first
03:11 - off I have a header uh and then I have a
03:15 - container a regular container inside of
03:17 - that I have a now bar I have removed
03:19 - some of this now bar parts that came
03:22 - with um boot shop component and uh if we
03:27 - scroll down I have this um
03:30 - a header title title and inside of the
03:32 - column md8 and I have this modifier
03:36 - added to that uh to the row class
03:39 - justify content Center which means the
03:42 - following column will be in a center so
03:45 - before bootstop 4 you were uh supposed
03:48 - to do like column md2 then column md8
03:53 - and in that way the column md8 would be
03:55 - in a center uh with B 4 with flex box
03:59 - you you don't have to do that you just
04:00 - put whatever column you want and it will
04:02 - be in a center uh actually you can do
04:06 - like column mg 11 and that will be in a
04:10 - center so they on this side will be a
04:12 - half a column and on this side will be a
04:14 - half a column but we are not going to do
04:17 - that and the same goes for the blog
04:20 - archive so I use justify content Center
04:22 - to Center my column
04:24 - md8 uh on in the center of the container
04:28 - and uh you can you can see I use um B
04:31 - name convention over here and also over
04:34 - here I have a a tag that will um cover
04:40 - this uh title in the paragraph So if we
04:43 - look over here both of them are
04:45 - hoverable with one link then I have some
04:47 - meta uh meta information down below uh
04:52 - posted by and a link to Albert Einstein
04:56 - posts and the date and that's it for the
04:59 - blog archive item and it just goes on
05:02 - repeating couple of those and then we
05:05 - have a footer and the footer is um
05:08 - practically the same from the previous
05:10 - section and uh this is it for the index
05:14 - page and if we go into a header at scss
05:19 - I have a image for the header and then I
05:21 - I'm using after pseudo element to have
05:25 - like an overlay that will be um this
05:28 - shade of black and that will be overlay
05:31 - uh overlay the header um and also I'm
05:34 - using Z index one and everything that is
05:39 - inside of the header I am bringing it up
05:42 - to Z index 2 Z index 3 because Z index
05:46 - one is the image then I have Z index 2
05:48 - for the overlay for this background and
05:52 - whatever sits on top of this overlay is
05:54 - the index 3 so I have nowar brand and
05:57 - now bar uh nowar now so the navigation
06:00 - the links and then the header title also
06:04 - has the Z index 3 and also I have this
06:09 - uh Blog Page modifier and I will show
06:11 - you how that works so if we head over
06:16 - to um this
06:21 - page uh simple
06:23 - post and we can see that I have a very
06:26 - similar design of the header but uh all
06:29 - of my text is to the left and I have
06:32 - this uh stuff this meta data information
06:36 - uh for the blog post and if we go and
06:40 - look at the header I have that stuff um
06:44 - the styles for those for that meta
06:46 - information over here and I also have
06:50 - this block page modifier so if we go to
06:54 - um blog. HTML scroll down
06:57 - to um the head
07:00 - so we have header title header title
07:02 - block page and this is the modifier and
07:05 - basically it takes the header title and
07:08 - aligns the text to the left and this is
07:11 - how I have added wait a minute where's
07:14 - there it is this how I have added
07:17 - the uh modifier just as another sort of
07:21 - child to the header title so I'm
07:24 - grabbing this header title uh and adding
07:27 - it to to here and then
07:30 - um-- Blog Page and that is my modifier
07:33 - so this is a very good example how to do
07:36 - uh modifiers with BS uh with BM and you
07:39 - don't have to like create a uh separate
07:42 - class you can do all inside of this um
07:44 - SAS component and if we go back to
07:50 - index. HTML not index but block.
07:54 - HTML and um I have some um paragraphs
08:00 - over here it's a red writing Hood um
08:03 - story or a part of it and I have it a
08:07 - bit differently from the
08:10 - index.html so the styles are pretty
08:13 - similar to this part over here but if we
08:16 - go
08:18 - to um blog archive that uh CSS uh we
08:23 - have this um options for H2 and a
08:27 - paragraph but if we open
08:31 - page that scss I have a couple more
08:33 - options and this is uh just to show you
08:38 - um how to do a fluid typography so if I
08:42 - will go ahead and duplicate this website
08:44 - and go to
08:48 - 3001 uh go to remote debuggin overlay
08:51 - CSS create and need to Overlay with Main
08:56 - and since my font size is 20 pixels
09:00 - so I will do a uh 20 pixel grid size so
09:04 - this is all set up and we are now doing
09:07 - no offset and for um vertical axis we
09:11 - are going to remove that we don't need
09:14 - the grid just uh lines and if we head
09:17 - back over to the Local Host we can see
09:20 - that every uh line of text sits on a
09:25 - fluid uh line so this is very easy to
09:27 - read very com comfortable to the user
09:30 - eyes so uh that is the main reason
09:33 - behind more of these options over here
09:36 - uh so uh this is it for this video um
09:41 - basically it's pretty easy not a lot of
09:44 - Uh custom CSS mainly just uh some uh CSS
09:49 - on this page
09:51 - and on the homepage and to create this
09:55 - um widgets for blog archive item and in
09:59 - our next next video we are going to
10:01 - create one more link over here for
10:03 - contact me and we are going to have some
10:05 - text paragraph and a
10:11 - form so before we go ahead and create
10:14 - that last page for this blog one thing I
10:18 - forgot uh to mention I think I forgot to
10:20 - mention U because I think this uh could
10:23 - be very useful is how to center this
10:25 - text in the header and if we head over
10:28 - to
10:30 - header the CSS I have header title as
10:33 - position relative because I need to use
10:35 - Z indexed and then I have this pattern
10:38 - so top is 200 pixels minus 68 pixels and
10:43 - bottom is 200 pixels and the reason why
10:46 - I'm using this uh
10:48 - subtraction of I'm subtracting 68 pixels
10:51 - from 200 is because if we going to go
10:54 - ahead and
10:57 - inspect uh our document
11:00 - head over to the now bar you can see
11:03 - that the now bar is uh
11:07 - 1,110 pixels by 68 pixels so what I'm
11:11 - doing is I'm making sure that my uh
11:15 - header title stays in the center of the
11:17 - image uh excluding this um nowbar so it
11:23 - sort of ignores the naber height and
11:25 - centers it in in the center of the image
11:28 - and if we head over to
11:29 - the uh sample um sample post it's still
11:34 - in the center of the image and the
11:36 - pattern stays the same and that's why
11:38 - the header kind of uh grows uh with the
11:41 - height of the header kind of grows um
11:44 - because of my 200 pixels so this is a
11:46 - very easy way to center a text in the
11:50 - center of uh the section just by adding
11:54 - the pattern on top and the bottom so
11:57 - having said that let's go ahead and get
11:59 - started with our new page so the first
12:02 - thing first we need a new file and we
12:06 - are going to call that
12:11 - file
12:13 - contact Das
12:15 - me
12:17 - HTML and I will go ahead and grab the
12:21 - about page and I'm just going to select
12:25 - all copy and paste paste it inside of
12:31 - here oops something did not work right
12:36 - copy and paste there we go and now this
12:41 - is going to be a contact me so instead
12:46 - of this about will
12:49 - be contact
12:52 - me uh maybe I can help
13:01 - maybe I can help Okay so for the uh H1
13:09 - over here actually we are going to get
13:12 - rid of this for the blog single exrt we
13:15 - are going to remove
13:18 - that and we are going to create a new
13:22 - div and call it
13:25 - contact and inside of that we are going
13:28 - to create create an
13:31 - H2
13:33 - uh contact
13:35 - form and we are going to assign a class
13:39 - so it's going to be
13:41 - contact uh underscore double underscore
13:45 - and
13:47 - H2 and now we need a form actually this
13:52 - supposed to be a class
13:59 - just like that so uh now we need the
14:02 - form and I will go ahead and grab that
14:04 - from the bootstrap page uh bootstrap
14:07 - documentation so if we head over to
14:09 - components form on get boot shop.com and
14:12 - I'll just go ahead and grab this one uh
14:14 - the first one and I will copy that code
14:18 - and come back over here and paste in
14:22 - that code
14:24 - beautify editor content and I will
14:27 - remove this um
14:30 - labels and the small text and label and
14:34 - a small text and this third one label
14:37 - and a small text so I have this form
14:39 - groups and for which I need I will have
14:43 - a name email and a message so I need um
14:49 - a name so this looks like it's going to
14:52 - work for
14:53 - me um for email actually so I'm going to
14:57 - paste this inside of here
15:00 - um email address and looks like
15:03 - everything is all right with this
15:07 - one and I will go ahead
15:09 - and paste it inside of here too and this
15:13 - one is going to
15:14 - be
15:17 - um this one's going to be for the name
15:20 - so instead of email address uh we'll say
15:24 - name and type is going to be text form
15:28 - control ID is going to be
15:34 - um
15:36 - contact form name and same thing for the
15:41 - email
15:42 - address going to be
15:44 - contact form
15:48 - email and if we scroll for uh further we
15:53 - have at the placeholder so we are going
15:57 - to uh just have name over
16:01 - here and over
16:04 - here is going to be name
16:11 - help and that's going to be email help
16:13 - so uh that is done and now we need just
16:17 - a text area so let's go ahead and grab
16:21 - this example text area over here
16:26 - so I think this is what we're looking
16:28 - for for so let's go ahead and copy this
16:33 - part of
16:35 - documentation and head over to the text
16:38 - editor and paste that in and instead of
16:43 - this example form control text area we
16:47 - are going to
16:49 - do like that double
16:57 - cursor there you go
16:59 - uh we are going
17:02 - to uh call it contact
17:08 - form text
17:13 - area and just have message over
17:19 - here
17:22 - and that should be fine beautify editor
17:26 - content hit save and now we need to open
17:29 - this page so what I'm going to do is I'm
17:31 - going to duplicate this blog and instead
17:34 - of this blog. HTML have contact me.
17:39 - HTML um this says cannot get contact me
17:44 - at HTML and let's see what is going on
17:48 - so it looks like my contact me that HTML
17:51 - is sort of a partial so that's not where
17:54 - supposed to be a Sly mistake happens to
17:56 - everyone so let's move to the rout and
18:01 - now our web page should uh work properly
18:05 - so uh here we got uh our contact form
18:09 - looks pretty horrible and uh let's go
18:12 - ahead and fix it uh so the first thing
18:15 - is we need to figure out why this um
18:17 - message is um not in line and let's take
18:22 - a look at our code and we have this form
18:26 - check that we need to get rid of and
18:29 - that should solve the
18:33 - problem so that uh that's working and
18:36 - now let's uh uh let's give it some
18:39 - styles for the contact form so let's uh
18:43 - head over to our partials and now inside
18:46 - of the partials we are going to create a
18:48 - new file and call it uh contact that is
18:53 - CSS and inside of that file we are going
18:56 - to put the style for the contact page so
19:01 - uh to contact
19:02 - me uh we need to grab the this
19:07 - class and add it in
19:11 - and uh first off I'm going to add some
19:14 - margins so uh top and bottom 50
19:22 - pixels uh so that this will add the 50
19:26 - pixels on top and the bottom
19:30 - and the reason why we are not seeing any
19:32 - changes is because we need to add this
19:34 - contact. scss to our index. SSS so we
19:40 - are going to run import statement for
19:43 - contact and now we have those changes so
19:48 - the form looks uh kind of okay but we
19:51 - can do more styles on it and first off I
19:55 - want to Target this uh title and uh give
19:58 - it some other settings
20:01 - so we are going to go back to contact.
20:05 - SSS and I'm going to use a parent
20:08 - keyword and go for H2 and give it font
20:15 - uh weight of
20:18 - 900 so this should give it give it some
20:21 - font weight and now I am going to remove
20:25 - this um border radius so first off I
20:29 - need to find out which class exactly
20:32 - gives this um border radius and it looks
20:36 - like uh form control so inside of the
20:42 - contact I am going to look for a form
20:48 - control and I'm going to set border
20:51 - radius to zero and it should
20:54 - successfully
20:55 - override uh the Border radius so the
20:58 - Border radius looks different and same
21:00 - thing I'm going to do with the button
21:02 - because I don't like the uh rounded
21:04 - button and I'm going to apply this
21:07 - only to the form button so uh
21:13 - let's do the same thing for the
21:16 - BTN and Border radius to
21:23 - zero and that's it for the form it's
21:27 - pretty simple um not a lot of uh stuff
21:31 - not a lot of text not a lot of styles
21:33 - but nonetheless we have a form and one
21:35 - last thing that we need to do is um
21:39 - actually two two last things I want to
21:41 - change the color and add the uh contact
21:44 - me to the navigation so uh for the H2 I
21:50 - am going to go with the color pound
21:54 - 333 and uh let's go to index
21:59 - and uh to the navigation and we are
22:03 - going to copy this and paste it in and
22:06 - instead of block that HTML going to be
22:09 - contact me. HTML and we are going to
22:13 - have
22:15 - contct me so now what we are going to do
22:18 - is we're going to copy this
22:22 - ul
22:24 - and uh we have to add it to every single
22:29 - page
22:32 - so this gets the new new
22:36 - navigation as well as the
22:41 - blog and as well as contact
22:45 - me gets the new navigation and index
22:50 - should have the new
22:52 - navigation uh so we save all of our
22:55 - pages and now we have contact me over
22:58 - here go to simple post we have contact
23:00 - me about and
23:03 - home so this is a complete version of
23:08 - very simple blog that you can uh build
23:10 - with boot shop as you can see it's very
23:13 - simple not a lot of CSS maybe like 160
23:16 - lines of custom CSS and you have a very
23:19 - clean very modern um block of with
23:23 - bootstrap

Cleaned transcript:

in this section we are going to create a blog um the blog is mostly uh created just have one page left and I am going to live code that page so what we're going to do in this section is we're going to walk through the code I'll show you some tricks that I used to create uh the block and then we are going to live code the contact me page because that page does not exist yet on that blog and this is the blog that uh we are going to work on so it is made on bootstrap and uh believe it or not this web page um took me like 120 custom CSS lines to create so mainly just boot up with some um small amount of custom CSS and we have a fully function block basically what I got here is just quotes from Albert Einstein and if we click on this link we'll get to uh the page with um like a block single post and um by the way this is the Red Riding Hood story or part of it and then we have about page which has some short um extract from the um Albert Einstein biography and then the homepage so we need a contact page and we're going to add that page in and the this is a very modern slick looking very clean uh blog made on boot shop and uses very small amount of custom CSS so in our next video we are going to walk through the code I'm going to show you how I did it what um options I've used what boost shop components I have used over here and hopefully you're going to learn a lot from from this project so in this video we are going to talk about the way I have done this website and the first off I think the most important aspect of creating a web page is um how you are structuring your SS um and I'll just want to take a brief moment and talk about um my partials and basically I have a global partial from the previous sections and then I have a header with some bootstop override and then I have a Blog archive a very small component for the blog archive blog archive is uh this part over here and uh after blog archive I have the page is for the blog uh single post and then I have the footer uh so not not a lot of code as you see and uh we get a pretty nice looking website from that and for the HTML markup I will go ahead and look at index. HTML and the first off I have a header uh and then I have a container a regular container inside of that I have a now bar I have removed some of this now bar parts that came with um boot shop component and uh if we scroll down I have this um a header title title and inside of the column md8 and I have this modifier added to that uh to the row class justify content Center which means the following column will be in a center so before bootstop 4 you were uh supposed to do like column md2 then column md8 and in that way the column md8 would be in a center uh with B 4 with flex box you you don't have to do that you just put whatever column you want and it will be in a center uh actually you can do like column mg 11 and that will be in a center so they on this side will be a half a column and on this side will be a half a column but we are not going to do that and the same goes for the blog archive so I use justify content Center to Center my column md8 uh on in the center of the container and uh you can you can see I use um B name convention over here and also over here I have a a tag that will um cover this uh title in the paragraph So if we look over here both of them are hoverable with one link then I have some meta uh meta information down below uh posted by and a link to Albert Einstein posts and the date and that's it for the blog archive item and it just goes on repeating couple of those and then we have a footer and the footer is um practically the same from the previous section and uh this is it for the index page and if we go into a header at scss I have a image for the header and then I I'm using after pseudo element to have like an overlay that will be um this shade of black and that will be overlay uh overlay the header um and also I'm using Z index one and everything that is inside of the header I am bringing it up to Z index 2 Z index 3 because Z index one is the image then I have Z index 2 for the overlay for this background and whatever sits on top of this overlay is the index 3 so I have nowar brand and now bar uh nowar now so the navigation the links and then the header title also has the Z index 3 and also I have this uh Blog Page modifier and I will show you how that works so if we head over to um this page uh simple post and we can see that I have a very similar design of the header but uh all of my text is to the left and I have this uh stuff this meta data information uh for the blog post and if we go and look at the header I have that stuff um the styles for those for that meta information over here and I also have this block page modifier so if we go to um blog. HTML scroll down to um the head so we have header title header title block page and this is the modifier and basically it takes the header title and aligns the text to the left and this is how I have added wait a minute where's there it is this how I have added the uh modifier just as another sort of child to the header title so I'm grabbing this header title uh and adding it to to here and then um Blog Page and that is my modifier so this is a very good example how to do uh modifiers with BS uh with BM and you don't have to like create a uh separate class you can do all inside of this um SAS component and if we go back to index. HTML not index but block. HTML and um I have some um paragraphs over here it's a red writing Hood um story or a part of it and I have it a bit differently from the index.html so the styles are pretty similar to this part over here but if we go to um blog archive that uh CSS uh we have this um options for H2 and a paragraph but if we open page that scss I have a couple more options and this is uh just to show you um how to do a fluid typography so if I will go ahead and duplicate this website and go to 3001 uh go to remote debuggin overlay CSS create and need to Overlay with Main and since my font size is 20 pixels so I will do a uh 20 pixel grid size so this is all set up and we are now doing no offset and for um vertical axis we are going to remove that we don't need the grid just uh lines and if we head back over to the Local Host we can see that every uh line of text sits on a fluid uh line so this is very easy to read very com comfortable to the user eyes so uh that is the main reason behind more of these options over here uh so uh this is it for this video um basically it's pretty easy not a lot of Uh custom CSS mainly just uh some uh CSS on this page and on the homepage and to create this um widgets for blog archive item and in our next next video we are going to create one more link over here for contact me and we are going to have some text paragraph and a form so before we go ahead and create that last page for this blog one thing I forgot uh to mention I think I forgot to mention U because I think this uh could be very useful is how to center this text in the header and if we head over to header the CSS I have header title as position relative because I need to use Z indexed and then I have this pattern so top is 200 pixels minus 68 pixels and bottom is 200 pixels and the reason why I'm using this uh subtraction of I'm subtracting 68 pixels from 200 is because if we going to go ahead and inspect uh our document head over to the now bar you can see that the now bar is uh 1,110 pixels by 68 pixels so what I'm doing is I'm making sure that my uh header title stays in the center of the image uh excluding this um nowbar so it sort of ignores the naber height and centers it in in the center of the image and if we head over to the uh sample um sample post it's still in the center of the image and the pattern stays the same and that's why the header kind of uh grows uh with the height of the header kind of grows um because of my 200 pixels so this is a very easy way to center a text in the center of uh the section just by adding the pattern on top and the bottom so having said that let's go ahead and get started with our new page so the first thing first we need a new file and we are going to call that file contact Das me HTML and I will go ahead and grab the about page and I'm just going to select all copy and paste paste it inside of here oops something did not work right copy and paste there we go and now this is going to be a contact me so instead of this about will be contact me uh maybe I can help maybe I can help Okay so for the uh H1 over here actually we are going to get rid of this for the blog single exrt we are going to remove that and we are going to create a new div and call it contact and inside of that we are going to create create an H2 uh contact form and we are going to assign a class so it's going to be contact uh underscore double underscore and H2 and now we need a form actually this supposed to be a class just like that so uh now we need the form and I will go ahead and grab that from the bootstrap page uh bootstrap documentation so if we head over to components form on get boot shop.com and I'll just go ahead and grab this one uh the first one and I will copy that code and come back over here and paste in that code beautify editor content and I will remove this um labels and the small text and label and a small text and this third one label and a small text so I have this form groups and for which I need I will have a name email and a message so I need um a name so this looks like it's going to work for me um for email actually so I'm going to paste this inside of here um email address and looks like everything is all right with this one and I will go ahead and paste it inside of here too and this one is going to be um this one's going to be for the name so instead of email address uh we'll say name and type is going to be text form control ID is going to be um contact form name and same thing for the email address going to be contact form email and if we scroll for uh further we have at the placeholder so we are going to uh just have name over here and over here is going to be name help and that's going to be email help so uh that is done and now we need just a text area so let's go ahead and grab this example text area over here so I think this is what we're looking for for so let's go ahead and copy this part of documentation and head over to the text editor and paste that in and instead of this example form control text area we are going to do like that double cursor there you go uh we are going to uh call it contact form text area and just have message over here and that should be fine beautify editor content hit save and now we need to open this page so what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this blog and instead of this blog. HTML have contact me. HTML um this says cannot get contact me at HTML and let's see what is going on so it looks like my contact me that HTML is sort of a partial so that's not where supposed to be a Sly mistake happens to everyone so let's move to the rout and now our web page should uh work properly so uh here we got uh our contact form looks pretty horrible and uh let's go ahead and fix it uh so the first thing is we need to figure out why this um message is um not in line and let's take a look at our code and we have this form check that we need to get rid of and that should solve the problem so that uh that's working and now let's uh uh let's give it some styles for the contact form so let's uh head over to our partials and now inside of the partials we are going to create a new file and call it uh contact that is CSS and inside of that file we are going to put the style for the contact page so uh to contact me uh we need to grab the this class and add it in and uh first off I'm going to add some margins so uh top and bottom 50 pixels uh so that this will add the 50 pixels on top and the bottom and the reason why we are not seeing any changes is because we need to add this contact. scss to our index. SSS so we are going to run import statement for contact and now we have those changes so the form looks uh kind of okay but we can do more styles on it and first off I want to Target this uh title and uh give it some other settings so we are going to go back to contact. SSS and I'm going to use a parent keyword and go for H2 and give it font uh weight of 900 so this should give it give it some font weight and now I am going to remove this um border radius so first off I need to find out which class exactly gives this um border radius and it looks like uh form control so inside of the contact I am going to look for a form control and I'm going to set border radius to zero and it should successfully override uh the Border radius so the Border radius looks different and same thing I'm going to do with the button because I don't like the uh rounded button and I'm going to apply this only to the form button so uh let's do the same thing for the BTN and Border radius to zero and that's it for the form it's pretty simple um not a lot of uh stuff not a lot of text not a lot of styles but nonetheless we have a form and one last thing that we need to do is um actually two two last things I want to change the color and add the uh contact me to the navigation so uh for the H2 I am going to go with the color pound 333 and uh let's go to index and uh to the navigation and we are going to copy this and paste it in and instead of block that HTML going to be contact me. HTML and we are going to have contct me so now what we are going to do is we're going to copy this ul and uh we have to add it to every single page so this gets the new new navigation as well as the blog and as well as contact me gets the new navigation and index should have the new navigation uh so we save all of our pages and now we have contact me over here go to simple post we have contact me about and home so this is a complete version of very simple blog that you can uh build with boot shop as you can see it's very simple not a lot of CSS maybe like 160 lines of custom CSS and you have a very clean very modern um block of with bootstrap
