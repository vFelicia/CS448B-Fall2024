00:03 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:05 - show you how to create a simple
00:07 - calculator using your C Windows Form
00:10 - application so I'm going to show you how
00:12 - to make this kind of a calculator which
00:14 - can perform your basic operation of
00:16 - division multiplication subtraction and
00:19 - addition and uh in addition we will have
00:23 - these two buttons called clear entry and
00:26 - clear
00:27 - button and I will also show you how to
00:30 - add to decimal number for example you
00:32 - want to add 3.3 + uh
00:38 - 12.5 you could do that using this
00:41 - calculator and it will shows this
00:45 - pending result here in a label so when I
00:49 - want to do some operation you see it
00:53 - shows me this pending value in this
00:57 - label here this also I'm going to show
00:59 - you you and basically I want to make
01:03 - this calculator like a window uh
01:06 - calculator but obviously this Windows
01:09 - calculator is much advanced than this
01:12 - calculator but I I'm going to show you
01:14 - how to create this simple kind of
01:17 - calculator which can perform these
01:20 - operations okay so let's get
01:24 - started how we can create it and we are
01:28 - going to create it something like this
01:30 - so I will open my blank project I'm
01:34 - going to create a new project so I will
01:36 - create click new project this will be a
01:39 - Windows Form application project and I
01:41 - will name it
01:44 - as calculator Okay click okay and will
01:49 - create a project for
01:56 - you and if we have this project I will
02:00 - make it little bit bigger and the first
02:04 - thing I want to do is I want to open
02:08 - this form at the center so for example
02:10 - whenever I open this Windows calculator
02:14 - let's
02:15 - see calculator it opens at the center of
02:19 - your window right and the second thing
02:22 - you uh notice here is you cannot
02:24 - maximize your calculator right you
02:27 - cannot resize it so these two things I'm
02:31 - going to show you first and the third
02:33 - thing is how to add a icon to your
02:35 - calculator so let's see how we can do it
02:38 - first of all
02:40 - the disabling of this maximize button so
02:43 - select your form here and search for the
02:48 - property called
02:49 - maximize box and by default it's true
02:53 - you need to make it false so just make
02:56 - it false and then in order
03:01 - to make or open
03:04 - your project or this form in the center
03:07 - go to the property called start position
03:11 - and by default it's uh window default
03:15 - and make this property as Center screen
03:18 - okay so this will open your W window or
03:21 - form in the center now let's try and run
03:25 - the program once again and let's see if
03:28 - it's opening in in the center yes it's
03:30 - opening and in the center and this is
03:33 - disabled right this maximize button but
03:37 - even then you can resize it like this
03:41 - right so how to disable this resizing
03:45 - also I will search for the property
03:47 - called form bordering
03:50 - style so search for the property called
03:53 - form bring style first first of all
03:56 - select this and search for the property
03:58 - called form bordering Style file and by
04:00 - default it's sizable you need to make it
04:04 - fixed dialogue okay so make it fixed
04:07 - dialogue and once again run your program
04:10 - and now I cannot resize my form okay so
04:14 - these three things we have achieved now
04:18 - the icon for this form and the name also
04:23 - okay so
04:26 - the windows calculator has the name
04:28 - calculator and this icon okay so we will
04:32 - we are going to do that select your form
04:35 - and go to the property called text and
04:38 - by default it's form one make it
04:44 - calculator calculator so you can see
04:47 - calculator here and the icon okay so you
04:50 - can choose this icon uh from if you have
04:54 - some icon for your calculator and I will
04:59 - show you how to easily get an icon you
05:01 - can find this icon online very easily I
05:05 - I found I have or I generally go to one
05:08 - site
05:09 - called uh
05:13 - icon
05:15 - archive and this has so many items or
05:19 - icons and uh many other things and I
05:22 - will search for
05:26 - the calculator and I will find these
05:29 - kind of icons of the calculator so
05:32 - select one icon which you find uh good I
05:36 - found this icon good so I I just
05:38 - downloaded this icon image just click
05:41 - this icon and it will be downloaded I
05:43 - think you see so I have already
05:45 - downloaded this icon and what I'm going
05:49 - to do is Select my form I'm going to
05:51 - select my form and go to the property
05:52 - called icon and in here I can browse for
05:56 - that
05:57 - icon and select that icon and open it
06:00 - and that will add this icon here okay so
06:04 - now I have all these basic uh settings
06:09 - now I want to add these buttons right so
06:13 - go to your toolbx and drag and drop a
06:17 - button in here and the button first of
06:21 - all I will change the button
06:23 - name as one and I will change the size
06:27 - of the button for example 45 by 45 you
06:32 - can make it other settings also and I'm
06:35 - going to change the font size of this
06:37 - button
06:38 - also to for example bold 14 okay so it
06:45 - will look good now basically all these
06:48 - buttons are same in size just we need to
06:51 - change the text of these buttons and one
06:53 - more important thing is the name of this
06:56 - button I'm leaving this these names as
06:59 - default but if you want to uh you know
07:03 - uh make your project uh perfect you need
07:06 - to change this name to logical names for
07:10 - the because I have time constrained uh
07:13 - that's why I'm not changing this but
07:15 - please change these button names
07:17 - according to logical name for example
07:19 - for this uh one uh button one you can
07:24 - just uh name it as uh
07:27 - button one or button one something like
07:32 - this okay so change it uh like this and
07:37 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
07:38 - copy this button just copy it and paste
07:42 - it okay and once more paste it and we
07:48 - need a row of five buttons like this and
07:53 - I will copy this this row of five
07:55 - buttons and once again paste this and I
07:59 - will just settle it here once again
08:02 - paste it settle it just below that and
08:04 - paste it and settle it just below that
08:08 - I'll resize this form a
08:11 - little
08:13 - and okay now I will just change the text
08:17 - of these buttons
08:19 - so this starts from here so as as you
08:24 - can see here this zero button is a
08:26 - little bit bigger and this um
08:30 - this button is little bit bigger right
08:32 - equal to button so I will change it like
08:36 - that this will be like this and this
08:41 - will be like this and now I'm going to
08:45 - change the text this is our button zero
08:49 - zero this will be one this will be
08:55 - two this will
08:58 - be
09:00 - 3
09:08 - 4
09:10 - 5
09:15 - 6
09:18 - 7 8 and 9
09:23 - right
09:24 - and this should be point so I will add a
09:30 - little Point here and let's start from
09:34 - here these are the operators we are
09:36 - going to use for example uh plus minus
09:41 - multiplication and division so first is
09:45 - plus second is
09:49 - minus third is multiplication which is
09:53 - represented by this estx and fourth is
09:57 - division which is this one this is our
10:00 - equal to sign change it to equal to like
10:04 - this this is our clear button so I will
10:07 - just give this text C
10:11 - and this is our clear entry so
10:14 - c and e okay I will just resize it so
10:20 - that we can see this
10:24 - C
10:27 - okay so now now we have all the
10:30 - buttons and now we need our text box so
10:34 - I'm going to go to my tool box and take
10:38 - a text box to show the result and
10:40 - entries right so I will take a text box
10:46 - here and resize this text
10:51 - box and I'm going to take a
10:57 - label so take a a label drag and drop
11:01 - here for now I'm not changing the text
11:05 - in the label but yeah you can change it
11:08 - just select both of these labels and
11:11 - text and go to font and we are going to
11:13 - change this font also as bold
11:17 - 14 okay so we can see the text you can
11:22 - change the label background also just
11:27 - select your label and
11:29 - go to the property called
11:41 - background here so Background by default
11:45 - it's something like gray I want to make
11:47 - it white so that it can resemble with
11:52 - our text box color
11:55 - and the name of this text box I will
11:59 - name change the name as textbox
12:04 - underscore
12:06 - result okay so I have these things now
12:11 - now what I need to do here is I need to
12:15 - have the button entry so for example I
12:18 - press some button it should print that
12:21 - entry to the text box right so basically
12:25 - you can do it like this you can select a
12:28 - button
12:29 - and go to this property box and click
12:34 - this event button here event and the
12:37 - basic uh button event is button click
12:40 - event so you can go to this button click
12:43 - event or directly double click this
12:45 - button so I'm going to use this option
12:48 - but you can double click this button
12:50 - also and I'm going to Define this button
12:53 - click event as for
12:57 - example
13:00 - button
13:02 - underscore click and just press this or
13:07 - just enter press enter and you will
13:10 - reach to this button click event of this
13:13 - uh button right and here you can uh uh
13:19 - write or you can print the text on the
13:21 - text box for example you want to print
13:24 - the text on this text box take the name
13:27 - of this text box
13:30 - just textbox
13:34 - result
13:36 - dot
13:37 - text is equal
13:40 - to whatever is this text plus plus is a
13:46 - concatenation operator so you can do
13:50 - like this because we are adding one and
13:54 - if you see here by default this text box
13:56 - has zero so I'm I'm going to change this
14:00 - just select your text box and go to text
14:02 - and we write zero here so it shows zero
14:07 - but this zero is on the left hand side
14:09 - and this text box is on the right hand
14:11 - side so just select this and go to the
14:16 - property called text align by default
14:18 - it's left
14:20 - just make it right so this zero will go
14:24 - to the right okay now when I run the
14:27 - program and when I click one you see one
14:31 - is printed here but the same
14:33 - functionality I want to do it for all
14:35 - the numbers and including this point so
14:39 - what I can do is um I have two options I
14:42 - can just just double click all the
14:44 - buttons and uh I perform this
14:48 - functionality to each button uh and the
14:51 - SE second option is I can perform same
14:55 - same operation or same uh button click
14:58 - event for for all these uh numbers and
15:02 - basically capture the text of these uh
15:05 - button uh whenever I press any button so
15:08 - how can I do this I will go to just uh
15:12 - this button click event I will select
15:14 - this button one and go to this click
15:17 - event by clicking going to this events
15:20 - and click event and copy this method
15:23 - which I have provided which is button
15:25 - click just copy this method or or this
15:29 - event whatever you want to say it and
15:33 - just go to all the numbers what I will
15:35 - start from zero just select this uh zero
15:38 - text box and go to the event click in
15:42 - this property and paste your same event
15:46 - button click here okay same I will do it
15:50 - for this point same I will do it for
15:55 - two
15:57 - three
16:01 - 4
16:03 - 5
16:06 - 6
16:08 - 7
16:11 - 8 and 9 okay and once again go to your
16:16 - code and now this button click event
16:19 - will be performed when any of the number
16:22 - button is clicked but how to catch that
16:25 - uh uh event or how to uh take the text
16:30 - from the button click and transfer it to
16:32 - this text box it's uh really simple this
16:35 - object contains the sender of this
16:38 - button click just take this uh sender so
16:42 - just go to button click event and here
16:46 - write button and we name our object as
16:52 - button is equal to and we will cast this
16:56 - object to the budg button so just write
17:01 - sender and this will we will cast It
17:05 - cast it to
17:06 - button okay and now once we have this
17:11 - button we can just change this static
17:14 - test text to the button
17:21 - text okay now when we run the program
17:25 - and when we click anything 1 2 3 4
17:30 - or
17:32 - any number or point it will be printed
17:35 - like this one more thing you can do here
17:39 - is whenever I click any button here the
17:43 - zero goes and this number comes right or
17:47 - by default it's zero but whenever I
17:50 - click any number it goes uh zero goes
17:53 - and six comes but in our condition when
17:57 - I click this three
17:59 - zero is uh there and it doesn't go right
18:04 - so it doesn't make any difference but I
18:07 - want to I mean achieve the same
18:10 - functionality
18:11 - so what I can say is here
18:15 - if my textbox text which is textbox
18:19 - result
18:20 - text is equal to this is is equal to
18:27 - 0o
18:29 - then I want to clear
18:32 - the text box
18:35 - okay
18:37 - dot
18:41 - clear okay so this will clear my this
18:46 - zero whenever I click some
18:50 - number now I want to achieve the same uh
18:55 - operation or I want to achieve the Plus
18:58 - minus and this multiplication and
19:01 - division for uh uh the operation to
19:05 - perform so what I can do is like I have
19:09 - done for the number of buttons I can uh
19:15 - I can make a single method for all these
19:18 - uh operations so what I can do is I
19:21 - going select my first plus operator go
19:25 - to this click event of this operator and
19:28 - I will we
19:33 - say operator click
19:36 - eventcore click and just uh double click
19:41 - it or press enter and we reach to the
19:45 - operator click event same operator click
19:47 - event we will make for minus
19:50 - multiplication and division just copy
19:52 - this operator go to the minus button
19:56 - paste there go to the multiplication
19:59 - button and paste there in the click
20:01 - event and once again go to the division
20:05 - button and paste there
20:07 - okay so whenever I press any button for
20:12 - this plus minus or multiplication
20:15 - division this will we also are going to
20:19 - catch the button action and we will just
20:23 - take this like this
20:25 - here and we want to store this button
20:29 - operation in some variable so we go at
20:32 - the top of our class

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to create a simple calculator using your C Windows Form application so I'm going to show you how to make this kind of a calculator which can perform your basic operation of division multiplication subtraction and addition and uh in addition we will have these two buttons called clear entry and clear button and I will also show you how to add to decimal number for example you want to add 3.3 + uh 12.5 you could do that using this calculator and it will shows this pending result here in a label so when I want to do some operation you see it shows me this pending value in this label here this also I'm going to show you you and basically I want to make this calculator like a window uh calculator but obviously this Windows calculator is much advanced than this calculator but I I'm going to show you how to create this simple kind of calculator which can perform these operations okay so let's get started how we can create it and we are going to create it something like this so I will open my blank project I'm going to create a new project so I will create click new project this will be a Windows Form application project and I will name it as calculator Okay click okay and will create a project for you and if we have this project I will make it little bit bigger and the first thing I want to do is I want to open this form at the center so for example whenever I open this Windows calculator let's see calculator it opens at the center of your window right and the second thing you uh notice here is you cannot maximize your calculator right you cannot resize it so these two things I'm going to show you first and the third thing is how to add a icon to your calculator so let's see how we can do it first of all the disabling of this maximize button so select your form here and search for the property called maximize box and by default it's true you need to make it false so just make it false and then in order to make or open your project or this form in the center go to the property called start position and by default it's uh window default and make this property as Center screen okay so this will open your W window or form in the center now let's try and run the program once again and let's see if it's opening in in the center yes it's opening and in the center and this is disabled right this maximize button but even then you can resize it like this right so how to disable this resizing also I will search for the property called form bordering style so search for the property called form bring style first first of all select this and search for the property called form bordering Style file and by default it's sizable you need to make it fixed dialogue okay so make it fixed dialogue and once again run your program and now I cannot resize my form okay so these three things we have achieved now the icon for this form and the name also okay so the windows calculator has the name calculator and this icon okay so we will we are going to do that select your form and go to the property called text and by default it's form one make it calculator calculator so you can see calculator here and the icon okay so you can choose this icon uh from if you have some icon for your calculator and I will show you how to easily get an icon you can find this icon online very easily I I found I have or I generally go to one site called uh icon archive and this has so many items or icons and uh many other things and I will search for the calculator and I will find these kind of icons of the calculator so select one icon which you find uh good I found this icon good so I I just downloaded this icon image just click this icon and it will be downloaded I think you see so I have already downloaded this icon and what I'm going to do is Select my form I'm going to select my form and go to the property called icon and in here I can browse for that icon and select that icon and open it and that will add this icon here okay so now I have all these basic uh settings now I want to add these buttons right so go to your toolbx and drag and drop a button in here and the button first of all I will change the button name as one and I will change the size of the button for example 45 by 45 you can make it other settings also and I'm going to change the font size of this button also to for example bold 14 okay so it will look good now basically all these buttons are same in size just we need to change the text of these buttons and one more important thing is the name of this button I'm leaving this these names as default but if you want to uh you know uh make your project uh perfect you need to change this name to logical names for the because I have time constrained uh that's why I'm not changing this but please change these button names according to logical name for example for this uh one uh button one you can just uh name it as uh button one or button one something like this okay so change it uh like this and what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this button just copy it and paste it okay and once more paste it and we need a row of five buttons like this and I will copy this this row of five buttons and once again paste this and I will just settle it here once again paste it settle it just below that and paste it and settle it just below that I'll resize this form a little and okay now I will just change the text of these buttons so this starts from here so as as you can see here this zero button is a little bit bigger and this um this button is little bit bigger right equal to button so I will change it like that this will be like this and this will be like this and now I'm going to change the text this is our button zero zero this will be one this will be two this will be 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 right and this should be point so I will add a little Point here and let's start from here these are the operators we are going to use for example uh plus minus multiplication and division so first is plus second is minus third is multiplication which is represented by this estx and fourth is division which is this one this is our equal to sign change it to equal to like this this is our clear button so I will just give this text C and this is our clear entry so c and e okay I will just resize it so that we can see this C okay so now now we have all the buttons and now we need our text box so I'm going to go to my tool box and take a text box to show the result and entries right so I will take a text box here and resize this text box and I'm going to take a label so take a a label drag and drop here for now I'm not changing the text in the label but yeah you can change it just select both of these labels and text and go to font and we are going to change this font also as bold 14 okay so we can see the text you can change the label background also just select your label and go to the property called background here so Background by default it's something like gray I want to make it white so that it can resemble with our text box color and the name of this text box I will name change the name as textbox underscore result okay so I have these things now now what I need to do here is I need to have the button entry so for example I press some button it should print that entry to the text box right so basically you can do it like this you can select a button and go to this property box and click this event button here event and the basic uh button event is button click event so you can go to this button click event or directly double click this button so I'm going to use this option but you can double click this button also and I'm going to Define this button click event as for example button underscore click and just press this or just enter press enter and you will reach to this button click event of this uh button right and here you can uh uh write or you can print the text on the text box for example you want to print the text on this text box take the name of this text box just textbox result dot text is equal to whatever is this text plus plus is a concatenation operator so you can do like this because we are adding one and if you see here by default this text box has zero so I'm I'm going to change this just select your text box and go to text and we write zero here so it shows zero but this zero is on the left hand side and this text box is on the right hand side so just select this and go to the property called text align by default it's left just make it right so this zero will go to the right okay now when I run the program and when I click one you see one is printed here but the same functionality I want to do it for all the numbers and including this point so what I can do is um I have two options I can just just double click all the buttons and uh I perform this functionality to each button uh and the SE second option is I can perform same same operation or same uh button click event for for all these uh numbers and basically capture the text of these uh button uh whenever I press any button so how can I do this I will go to just uh this button click event I will select this button one and go to this click event by clicking going to this events and click event and copy this method which I have provided which is button click just copy this method or or this event whatever you want to say it and just go to all the numbers what I will start from zero just select this uh zero text box and go to the event click in this property and paste your same event button click here okay same I will do it for this point same I will do it for two three 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 okay and once again go to your code and now this button click event will be performed when any of the number button is clicked but how to catch that uh uh event or how to uh take the text from the button click and transfer it to this text box it's uh really simple this object contains the sender of this button click just take this uh sender so just go to button click event and here write button and we name our object as button is equal to and we will cast this object to the budg button so just write sender and this will we will cast It cast it to button okay and now once we have this button we can just change this static test text to the button text okay now when we run the program and when we click anything 1 2 3 4 or any number or point it will be printed like this one more thing you can do here is whenever I click any button here the zero goes and this number comes right or by default it's zero but whenever I click any number it goes uh zero goes and six comes but in our condition when I click this three zero is uh there and it doesn't go right so it doesn't make any difference but I want to I mean achieve the same functionality so what I can say is here if my textbox text which is textbox result text is equal to this is is equal to 0o then I want to clear the text box okay dot clear okay so this will clear my this zero whenever I click some number now I want to achieve the same uh operation or I want to achieve the Plus minus and this multiplication and division for uh uh the operation to perform so what I can do is like I have done for the number of buttons I can uh I can make a single method for all these uh operations so what I can do is I going select my first plus operator go to this click event of this operator and I will we say operator click eventcore click and just uh double click it or press enter and we reach to the operator click event same operator click event we will make for minus multiplication and division just copy this operator go to the minus button paste there go to the multiplication button and paste there in the click event and once again go to the division button and paste there okay so whenever I press any button for this plus minus or multiplication division this will we also are going to catch the button action and we will just take this like this here and we want to store this button operation in some variable so we go at the top of our class
