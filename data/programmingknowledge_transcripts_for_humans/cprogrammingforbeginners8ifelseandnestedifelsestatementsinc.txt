00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - if statement in C programming now in
00:07 - this video I'm going to show you how you
00:09 - can use IFL statement in C and how you
00:14 - even you can use nested IFL statement in
00:18 - C programming so in the last video I
00:22 - have given you an example that how you
00:25 - can check the age of the person whether
00:28 - it's greater than 18 or equal to 18 or
00:32 - it's uh less than 18 right now I'm going
00:35 - to take the same example to uh
00:38 - demonstrate if else statement so uh what
00:43 - I'm going to do is I'm going to delete
00:45 - this stuff and now for example we just
00:48 - want to
00:49 - check whether the age is greater than 18
00:56 - or it's not greater than 18 so we we
01:00 - want to print if the great age is
01:02 - greater than 18 then we want to print
01:04 - the ages greater than 18 otherwise we
01:08 - want to print that the age is not
01:11 - greater than 18 or age is less than 18
01:15 - right so how we can do this we can do
01:19 - this uh either you can write uh some
01:23 - condition that the age is uh for example
01:27 - if condition and something like like
01:30 - this from our last video but there is a
01:34 - condition called
01:36 - else which catches all the all the
01:41 - condition which is not true right so if
01:47 - AG is not greater than 18 then the
01:51 - program goes to this else condition and
01:55 - this else as the name suggest that it
01:59 - indic indicates every other condition
02:01 - which is not satisfied by or if
02:05 - condition so if the age is not greater
02:06 - than 18 then it goes here in the lse
02:10 - statement so else after this bracket and
02:13 - then your curly bracket so else doesn't
02:16 - take any condition because it doesn't
02:19 - need to uh check any condition because
02:22 - it's everything other than this if
02:26 - condition right so in here we want to
02:29 - just
02:30 - write that the age
02:33 - is not greater than not greater than 18
02:39 - right and I'm going to compile and run
02:41 - my program and this will give me the
02:45 - answer so please enter the age I will
02:48 - write for example age which is greater
02:51 - than 18 which is 21 and I will press
02:54 - enter and it says me the age is greater
02:57 - than 18 now I'm going to rerun the
02:59 - program and this time I'm going to give
03:03 - 15 Which is less than 18 right and I
03:07 - will just press enter and it says the
03:10 - age is not greater than 18 that
03:13 - means this condition is checked and if
03:16 - this condition is not true your program
03:20 - goes to this else condition or the else
03:25 - condition of this if statement and this
03:28 - line will be printed right so this is
03:31 - how you can use lse statement whatever
03:34 - which is not true in this condition or
03:38 - which is not satisfied by if condition
03:41 - will be cached by this else condition
03:45 - right now there are situations where you
03:49 - need to check multiple uh situations so
03:54 - for
03:55 - example you can uh just check
04:00 - multiple condition by if else statement
04:03 - so for example you want to check if the
04:05 - age is greater than 18 or if the age is
04:08 - equal to 18 then you want to print age
04:11 - is equal to 18 otherwise you want to
04:13 - print that age is not greater than or
04:17 - equal to 18 so you can just give
04:20 - the else here and then
04:25 - if and as the as the name suggests you
04:29 - you can check the second condition using
04:33 - this lsf statement right and it also
04:37 - takes uh this curly braces just provide
04:41 - these curly braces here and here this
04:45 - because if
04:47 - it we are taking if condition here so we
04:51 - need to check other condition for
04:54 - example age is equal to 18 age is
05:00 - equal to 18 we are checking whether the
05:02 - age is equal to 18 if the age is equal
05:05 - to 18 we can just print age
05:09 - is equal
05:13 - to equal to 18 otherwise we will PR
05:17 - print AG is not greater than 18 or AG is
05:21 - not greater than
05:28 - or
05:30 - equal to 18 so age is not greater than
05:33 - or equal to 18 right so we can check
05:38 - these conditions and this is called else
05:41 - if so we can check multiple conditions
05:45 - by using El if statement if else if and
05:50 - then otherwise if the condition is not
05:52 - true then this uh will be executed so
05:55 - what will be the program flow here the
05:59 - program program will ask the age first
06:01 - to the user and it goes here and if this
06:05 - age entered by the user is greater than
06:07 - 18 then this will be printed and every
06:11 - other uh you know if condition will be
06:14 - ignored and this will uh not be executed
06:17 - this code and this code will not be
06:19 - executed otherwise if the age is not
06:22 - greater than 18 then it will go to this
06:26 - uh condition checking El if condition
06:28 - checking and your age if the age is
06:33 - equal to 18 then this will be printed
06:36 - and everything other then this will be
06:40 - skipped
06:42 - and all the other code will not be
06:44 - executed right otherwise if the age is
06:48 - not equal to 18 and if the age is not
06:51 - greater than 18 this code will be
06:53 - executed and in the same way you can use
06:58 - multiple if else conditions like
07:01 - this okay so it's not
07:04 - restricted that you only need to use one
07:07 - if else statement or else if if
07:10 - statement you can use multiple you know
07:12 - condition and you can check multiple
07:14 - conditions using IFL
07:17 - statement now for example you want uh to
07:22 - check whether uh you know this age is
07:26 - greater than 18 but it's less than uh 21
07:30 - also how you can check it so if the age
07:34 - is greater than 18 we want to print this
07:38 - condition and inside this code we also
07:40 - want to check if the age is uh you know
07:44 - uh less than 21 so you can use nested if
07:48 - conditions like this so here inside your
07:52 - if condition which is this curly braces
07:56 - you can use if once again you can check
07:59 - the age is less
08:03 - than less than
08:06 - 21 you can
08:10 - print ages less than 21 okay so you can
08:15 - just print age is greater than 18
08:20 - but less
08:22 - than
08:24 - 21 okay and in the you know uh other
08:30 - case you can just write else here
08:34 - else and you can just provide other
08:38 - statement that if the age is greater
08:42 - than 18 but it's not less than 21 so but
08:48 - not less than 21 okay I will compile and
08:52 - run this program and this is called
08:54 - nested if else condition okay so because
08:57 - you are using
09:00 - if condition inside a if Condition it's
09:03 - called nested if else uh statements okay
09:07 - so it's not necessary that you cannot uh
09:10 - use if condition inside if condition you
09:13 - can use multiple if condition to check
09:16 - multiple conditions in C right run the
09:20 - program and for example I give the age
09:24 - 26 which is greater than 18 but it's not
09:28 - less than 21 so ideally we will see this
09:32 - message the age is greater than 18 but
09:34 - not less than 21 press enter and it says
09:38 - the age is greater than 18 which is this
09:41 - statement which is due to this statement
09:43 - the age is greater than 18 now it goes
09:46 - here and it sees that 26 is not less
09:49 - than 21 so it goes to the else condition
09:52 - and it will print this the age is
09:53 - greater than 18 but not less than 21 and
09:57 - it's printing it here the age age is
09:59 - greater than 18 but not less than
10:02 - 21
10:04 - otherwise I will rerun this this program
10:06 - and uh let's delete or not delete but
10:11 - let's provide this uh line break
10:15 - here so that this will be the change in
10:19 - the line and this time we provide 20 as
10:22 - the age and it says that the age is
10:25 - greater than 18 but the age is is also
10:29 - less than 21 right so in this way you
10:35 - can uh just check whether this age is uh
10:41 - you know multiple condition you can
10:43 - check it from here right so this is how
10:46 - you can use IFL statement and nested LL
10:50 - statement in C this is called nested if
10:53 - inside your IFL statement and this is
10:56 - called lse if statement and this is
10:58 - called
10:59 - else statement in if statements so I
11:03 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

11:06 - now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use if statement in C programming now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use IFL statement in C and how you even you can use nested IFL statement in C programming so in the last video I have given you an example that how you can check the age of the person whether it's greater than 18 or equal to 18 or it's uh less than 18 right now I'm going to take the same example to uh demonstrate if else statement so uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this stuff and now for example we just want to check whether the age is greater than 18 or it's not greater than 18 so we we want to print if the great age is greater than 18 then we want to print the ages greater than 18 otherwise we want to print that the age is not greater than 18 or age is less than 18 right so how we can do this we can do this uh either you can write uh some condition that the age is uh for example if condition and something like like this from our last video but there is a condition called else which catches all the all the condition which is not true right so if AG is not greater than 18 then the program goes to this else condition and this else as the name suggest that it indic indicates every other condition which is not satisfied by or if condition so if the age is not greater than 18 then it goes here in the lse statement so else after this bracket and then your curly bracket so else doesn't take any condition because it doesn't need to uh check any condition because it's everything other than this if condition right so in here we want to just write that the age is not greater than not greater than 18 right and I'm going to compile and run my program and this will give me the answer so please enter the age I will write for example age which is greater than 18 which is 21 and I will press enter and it says me the age is greater than 18 now I'm going to rerun the program and this time I'm going to give 15 Which is less than 18 right and I will just press enter and it says the age is not greater than 18 that means this condition is checked and if this condition is not true your program goes to this else condition or the else condition of this if statement and this line will be printed right so this is how you can use lse statement whatever which is not true in this condition or which is not satisfied by if condition will be cached by this else condition right now there are situations where you need to check multiple uh situations so for example you can uh just check multiple condition by if else statement so for example you want to check if the age is greater than 18 or if the age is equal to 18 then you want to print age is equal to 18 otherwise you want to print that age is not greater than or equal to 18 so you can just give the else here and then if and as the as the name suggests you you can check the second condition using this lsf statement right and it also takes uh this curly braces just provide these curly braces here and here this because if it we are taking if condition here so we need to check other condition for example age is equal to 18 age is equal to 18 we are checking whether the age is equal to 18 if the age is equal to 18 we can just print age is equal to equal to 18 otherwise we will PR print AG is not greater than 18 or AG is not greater than or equal to 18 so age is not greater than or equal to 18 right so we can check these conditions and this is called else if so we can check multiple conditions by using El if statement if else if and then otherwise if the condition is not true then this uh will be executed so what will be the program flow here the program program will ask the age first to the user and it goes here and if this age entered by the user is greater than 18 then this will be printed and every other uh you know if condition will be ignored and this will uh not be executed this code and this code will not be executed otherwise if the age is not greater than 18 then it will go to this uh condition checking El if condition checking and your age if the age is equal to 18 then this will be printed and everything other then this will be skipped and all the other code will not be executed right otherwise if the age is not equal to 18 and if the age is not greater than 18 this code will be executed and in the same way you can use multiple if else conditions like this okay so it's not restricted that you only need to use one if else statement or else if if statement you can use multiple you know condition and you can check multiple conditions using IFL statement now for example you want uh to check whether uh you know this age is greater than 18 but it's less than uh 21 also how you can check it so if the age is greater than 18 we want to print this condition and inside this code we also want to check if the age is uh you know uh less than 21 so you can use nested if conditions like this so here inside your if condition which is this curly braces you can use if once again you can check the age is less than less than 21 you can print ages less than 21 okay so you can just print age is greater than 18 but less than 21 okay and in the you know uh other case you can just write else here else and you can just provide other statement that if the age is greater than 18 but it's not less than 21 so but not less than 21 okay I will compile and run this program and this is called nested if else condition okay so because you are using if condition inside a if Condition it's called nested if else uh statements okay so it's not necessary that you cannot uh use if condition inside if condition you can use multiple if condition to check multiple conditions in C right run the program and for example I give the age 26 which is greater than 18 but it's not less than 21 so ideally we will see this message the age is greater than 18 but not less than 21 press enter and it says the age is greater than 18 which is this statement which is due to this statement the age is greater than 18 now it goes here and it sees that 26 is not less than 21 so it goes to the else condition and it will print this the age is greater than 18 but not less than 21 and it's printing it here the age age is greater than 18 but not less than 21 otherwise I will rerun this this program and uh let's delete or not delete but let's provide this uh line break here so that this will be the change in the line and this time we provide 20 as the age and it says that the age is greater than 18 but the age is is also less than 21 right so in this way you can uh just check whether this age is uh you know multiple condition you can check it from here right so this is how you can use IFL statement and nested LL statement in C this is called nested if inside your IFL statement and this is called lse if statement and this is called else statement in if statements so I hope you have enjoyed this video please write
