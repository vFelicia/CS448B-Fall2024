00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - I'll be talking about the while loop
00:03 - okay so basically uh I've covered
00:06 - already the for Loop and in which we
00:07 - have discussed about the basics of
00:10 - looping and how loops work okay so now
00:11 - let's start with the while loop let me
00:13 - create this file first
00:15 - loop.sh and I will just add this C band
00:18 - or hashbank you can say here okay
00:20 - so
00:23 - here we go so now uh file Loop is also
00:26 - uh just like the follow but it is uh it
00:30 - works
00:32 - it works until the condition is true
00:38 - okay if condition gets fall we can come
00:40 - out from the loop and if condition is
00:42 - true it will execute that particular
00:43 - thing okay so let me just give you the
00:47 - syntax part like what is the sentence of
00:49 - value so while space and this double
00:51 - space and here you have to write the
00:54 - condition
00:56 - okay and then you will write like this
00:59 - uh do and whatever the code you want to
01:03 - perform here and then you have to do
01:05 - like here you have to write here done
01:07 - okay
01:08 - so this is the basic syntax of the while
01:12 - loop okay so now we will see the
01:14 - visualization part so let me uh open up
01:18 - my paint first
01:21 - okay but before that uh let me just copy
01:25 - the
01:27 - this one code where it is here
01:31 - okay
01:33 - now I have copied let me just paste it
01:36 - here
01:37 - okay
01:40 - I will need to just create this one like
01:43 - this
01:44 - to add a text and all those things
01:47 - so here we go and let me just remove
01:49 - this part
01:51 - okay
01:52 - and we also uh we forgot about this one
01:56 - like we need to give the
01:59 - semicolon all those things okay so let's
02:02 - start with implementation one suppose uh
02:05 - same case if you want to print something
02:06 - like my name if I want to print my name
02:09 - five times so how the thing will work
02:11 - okay so basically so here we will need
02:14 - to give the condition like we can give
02:16 - the I like uh
02:18 - I should be less than equal to 4 or less
02:21 - than 5 you can give the condition and
02:23 - above you can declare the
02:25 - I variable okay and here you will write
02:27 - the code like Echo
02:31 - and my name I use okay so how the thing
02:34 - will let me tell you here we will give
02:36 - the value of I
02:38 - and then we will check the condition and
02:40 - then increment okay so initially the
02:44 - value of I is 0 and condition will be
02:46 - get checked like 0 is less than equal to
02:47 - 4 yes it is less than equal to 4 so now
02:50 - what it will do it will print so here I
02:53 - write the print so here what it will
02:55 - print it will print simple
02:57 - ayush okay
02:58 - and the value we get incremented by one
03:01 - so now value 5 will be 1 and it will
03:04 - again check the condition whether one
03:06 - less than equal to 4 yes it is true so
03:08 - again print the name I use and again
03:11 - increase the variable to
03:13 - like to it will so now I will be 2 and
03:17 - again I will check the variable name
03:18 - like 2 less than equal to 4 okay
03:21 - and print and again it will increase the
03:24 - value five by one so I will be 3 and
03:27 - again it will check whether 3 less than
03:29 - equal to 4 yes it is true and again it
03:31 - will print and again value 5 we're
03:33 - getting is two by one that is 4 now I
03:35 - will be 4 and it will check yes 4 less
03:37 - than equal to 4 yes it is not December
03:40 - yeah it is equal to 4. so in this case
03:42 - also ice will get mint and value of I
03:45 - will be 5 now it will check I equal to 5
03:47 - whether 5 less than equal to 4 no it's
03:49 - not so this is the first condition and
03:52 - we can come out from the loop
03:54 - okay so same thing we have to do in
03:56 - while loop also so how we can do it
03:59 - let's me just go into the terminal and I
04:01 - will just comment out this part okay
04:05 - so here what I will do I will Define the
04:07 - variable I equal to 0 and I will give
04:09 - the condition like while
04:12 - and condition will be I should be less
04:15 - than equal to 4 and do what do nothing
04:20 - just Echo oh sorry Eco my name that is
04:25 - the ayush okay and here you can do done
04:29 - and also do increment you can increment
04:33 - like this let I plus plus okay here we
04:35 - forget forgot to increment uh
04:38 - this one so
04:40 - here uh we will increase the value of I
04:43 - okay
04:46 - so the same thing we have to do and now
04:50 - let's check whether this works or not so
04:53 - I will just give the appropriate
04:55 - permission
04:56 - uh sorry it will underscore while loop
05:00 - clear
05:02 - dot slash 12 underscore while loop
05:05 - so here you can see no such file or
05:07 - directory why it's showing like this
05:12 - uh
05:16 - okay
05:18 - let me just copy this code and I will
05:20 - delete this file actually
05:22 - 12 12 is 2 times so I will create like
05:26 - 13 while loop dot sh
05:31 - and paste it Ctrl s
05:35 - give the appropriate permission
05:38 - 13
05:39 - clear dot slash 13 and here we go and
05:43 - again what is showing line number
05:47 - oh sorry here we have to give the uh
05:50 - this one iPhone EQ
05:53 - less than equal to l e okay now it
05:57 - should run okay
05:59 - so here you can see five times I wish
06:01 - has been printed okay so in this in this
06:05 - form you can create the while loop okay
06:08 - so again if you want to use the while
06:10 - loop with an array we can use it also
06:12 - like uh to print the array so I will
06:14 - just create the array uh
06:17 - array equal to I will write 1 2 3 4 5.
06:23 - so size of array is 5
06:26 - and less than equal to 5 okay or less
06:30 - than equal to 4 it doesn't matter here
06:33 - and I will just Echo
06:37 - Echo the array
06:40 - array indexes okay
06:44 - and let me just again run the script and
06:47 - here you can see we have successfully
06:49 - accessed all the elements of an array so
06:52 - in this case uh you in this way you can
06:54 - use the while loop so I hope you got it
06:56 - and I will add this particular file in
06:58 - our GitHub repository so that's all for
07:00 - today's guide and I will meet you in the
07:02 - next video thank you thank you for
07:03 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys now in this particular video I'll be talking about the while loop okay so basically uh I've covered already the for Loop and in which we have discussed about the basics of looping and how loops work okay so now let's start with the while loop let me create this file first loop.sh and I will just add this C band or hashbank you can say here okay so here we go so now uh file Loop is also uh just like the follow but it is uh it works it works until the condition is true okay if condition gets fall we can come out from the loop and if condition is true it will execute that particular thing okay so let me just give you the syntax part like what is the sentence of value so while space and this double space and here you have to write the condition okay and then you will write like this uh do and whatever the code you want to perform here and then you have to do like here you have to write here done okay so this is the basic syntax of the while loop okay so now we will see the visualization part so let me uh open up my paint first okay but before that uh let me just copy the this one code where it is here okay now I have copied let me just paste it here okay I will need to just create this one like this to add a text and all those things so here we go and let me just remove this part okay and we also uh we forgot about this one like we need to give the semicolon all those things okay so let's start with implementation one suppose uh same case if you want to print something like my name if I want to print my name five times so how the thing will work okay so basically so here we will need to give the condition like we can give the I like uh I should be less than equal to 4 or less than 5 you can give the condition and above you can declare the I variable okay and here you will write the code like Echo and my name I use okay so how the thing will let me tell you here we will give the value of I and then we will check the condition and then increment okay so initially the value of I is 0 and condition will be get checked like 0 is less than equal to 4 yes it is less than equal to 4 so now what it will do it will print so here I write the print so here what it will print it will print simple ayush okay and the value we get incremented by one so now value 5 will be 1 and it will again check the condition whether one less than equal to 4 yes it is true so again print the name I use and again increase the variable to like to it will so now I will be 2 and again I will check the variable name like 2 less than equal to 4 okay and print and again it will increase the value five by one so I will be 3 and again it will check whether 3 less than equal to 4 yes it is true and again it will print and again value 5 we're getting is two by one that is 4 now I will be 4 and it will check yes 4 less than equal to 4 yes it is not December yeah it is equal to 4. so in this case also ice will get mint and value of I will be 5 now it will check I equal to 5 whether 5 less than equal to 4 no it's not so this is the first condition and we can come out from the loop okay so same thing we have to do in while loop also so how we can do it let's me just go into the terminal and I will just comment out this part okay so here what I will do I will Define the variable I equal to 0 and I will give the condition like while and condition will be I should be less than equal to 4 and do what do nothing just Echo oh sorry Eco my name that is the ayush okay and here you can do done and also do increment you can increment like this let I plus plus okay here we forget forgot to increment uh this one so here uh we will increase the value of I okay so the same thing we have to do and now let's check whether this works or not so I will just give the appropriate permission uh sorry it will underscore while loop clear dot slash 12 underscore while loop so here you can see no such file or directory why it's showing like this uh okay let me just copy this code and I will delete this file actually 12 12 is 2 times so I will create like 13 while loop dot sh and paste it Ctrl s give the appropriate permission 13 clear dot slash 13 and here we go and again what is showing line number oh sorry here we have to give the uh this one iPhone EQ less than equal to l e okay now it should run okay so here you can see five times I wish has been printed okay so in this in this form you can create the while loop okay so again if you want to use the while loop with an array we can use it also like uh to print the array so I will just create the array uh array equal to I will write 1 2 3 4 5. so size of array is 5 and less than equal to 5 okay or less than equal to 4 it doesn't matter here and I will just Echo Echo the array array indexes okay and let me just again run the script and here you can see we have successfully accessed all the elements of an array so in this case uh you in this way you can use the while loop so I hope you got it and I will add this particular file in our GitHub repository so that's all for today's guide and I will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching
