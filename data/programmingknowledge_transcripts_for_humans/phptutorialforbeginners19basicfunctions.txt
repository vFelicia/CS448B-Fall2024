00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - functions in PHP
00:07 - scripts and in this video I'm going to
00:10 - show you how to use Basics functions in
00:13 - PHP so first of all what is a function
00:17 - so a function is a block of code
00:20 - designed to perform a particular task
00:23 - right and why do we use function to
00:27 - increase the readability of the program
00:31 - and to perform a task which is
00:34 - repetitive in nature okay so for
00:38 - example uh first of all I will show you
00:41 - how to declare a function and then I
00:43 - will explain what this is doing so
00:48 - function is declared like this okay and
00:52 - this brace this it has these braces and
00:57 - curly braces so the this is the basic
01:01 - skeleton of a function okay and why do
01:04 - we use function function is a piece of
01:09 - code which we use to execute a
01:12 - particular task so for example I want to
01:15 - print something
01:18 - so Echo and for example I want to
01:24 - Echo
01:26 - hello world and I want to add go hello
01:30 - world for
01:33 - example hello world
01:36 - and with
01:39 - comma
01:41 - and in
01:47 - bold this is just an example I'm giving
01:50 - in the real world uh you can use
01:54 - function better than this so for example
01:57 - I want to use uh I want want to print
02:00 - these uh lines of code again and again
02:04 - in my PHP script okay so I want to use
02:08 - these three lines or I want to print
02:10 - these three lines again and again in my
02:13 - PHP script okay and I don't want to
02:16 - repeat these lines again and again so
02:20 - what we can do we can make a function
02:24 - called hello world function or I will
02:28 - rename it as
02:30 - hello
02:32 - underscore
02:34 - world so this is the basic Declaration
02:37 - of a function you have the name or key
02:40 - keyword function and then you name your
02:44 - function anything uh you can name your
02:47 - function anything other than reserved
02:50 - function in PHP so there are some
02:53 - reserved functions in PHP uh which you
02:55 - cannot use other than those you can uh
02:58 - declare any name to your function okay
03:02 - for example I want to print these three
03:04 - lines and I can just call my function so
03:08 - this is the Declaration of function now
03:11 - once you declare a function you can call
03:13 - your function from anywhere from your
03:17 - PHP code if it's a global function and
03:21 - we will talk about global function in
03:24 - some other video but to call this
03:26 - function you just need to write the name
03:29 - of the function
03:30 - and you just need to copy the signature
03:33 - so just copy this and paste it as it is
03:36 - and just add a semicolon so what is this
03:41 - this is a declaration or definition of a
03:43 - function and this is a function call so
03:46 - you're calling this function and
03:49 - whenever PHP sees that you are calling
03:52 - the function it will go here and it will
03:55 - execute the function when you call this
03:58 - I will save it and and I will try to run
04:01 - this and this is my function PHP I will
04:04 - run it and I can see hello world again
04:07 - and again but let's put a break
04:10 - here uh let's put some
04:14 - break
04:16 - here and here
04:20 - okay and I will save it and refresh this
04:24 - and now I can see hello world three
04:28 - times now so
04:30 - Suppose there is a need that this this
04:34 - these three lines have to be used again
04:37 - and again in my program okay this is
04:40 - this is a stupid example but yeah there
04:43 - is a need to call this function again
04:46 - and again or call this these three lines
04:49 - of code again and again so what are the
04:53 - options you just need to uh rewrite
04:56 - these three lines again and again
04:58 - somewhere again and again okay three or
05:00 - four lines and this makes your code
05:03 - really messy right so in order to make
05:09 - your code
05:10 - readable right and if you want to just
05:15 - uh perform this task again and again
05:17 - what you can do is you can just use call
05:20 - this function again and again and it
05:22 - will just execute this three lines of
05:24 - code and this makes your fun this makes
05:27 - your code really readable and you are
05:32 - not you don't have to type these three
05:34 - lines again and again right so I can
05:37 - just call my function two times in my
05:40 - program and it will print me this again
05:44 - right so this is the basic use of
05:48 - function
05:50 - okay so this is how you can use basic
05:53 - function in PHP there are other two
05:57 - types of uh function declaration which
05:59 - are called function with argument and
06:03 - function that Returns value which we are
06:06 - going to see in the next videos so
06:09 - please keep watching and please wait
06:11 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use functions in PHP scripts and in this video I'm going to show you how to use Basics functions in PHP so first of all what is a function so a function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task right and why do we use function to increase the readability of the program and to perform a task which is repetitive in nature okay so for example uh first of all I will show you how to declare a function and then I will explain what this is doing so function is declared like this okay and this brace this it has these braces and curly braces so the this is the basic skeleton of a function okay and why do we use function function is a piece of code which we use to execute a particular task so for example I want to print something so Echo and for example I want to Echo hello world and I want to add go hello world for example hello world and with comma and in bold this is just an example I'm giving in the real world uh you can use function better than this so for example I want to use uh I want want to print these uh lines of code again and again in my PHP script okay so I want to use these three lines or I want to print these three lines again and again in my PHP script okay and I don't want to repeat these lines again and again so what we can do we can make a function called hello world function or I will rename it as hello underscore world so this is the basic Declaration of a function you have the name or key keyword function and then you name your function anything uh you can name your function anything other than reserved function in PHP so there are some reserved functions in PHP uh which you cannot use other than those you can uh declare any name to your function okay for example I want to print these three lines and I can just call my function so this is the Declaration of function now once you declare a function you can call your function from anywhere from your PHP code if it's a global function and we will talk about global function in some other video but to call this function you just need to write the name of the function and you just need to copy the signature so just copy this and paste it as it is and just add a semicolon so what is this this is a declaration or definition of a function and this is a function call so you're calling this function and whenever PHP sees that you are calling the function it will go here and it will execute the function when you call this I will save it and and I will try to run this and this is my function PHP I will run it and I can see hello world again and again but let's put a break here uh let's put some break here and here okay and I will save it and refresh this and now I can see hello world three times now so Suppose there is a need that this this these three lines have to be used again and again in my program okay this is this is a stupid example but yeah there is a need to call this function again and again or call this these three lines of code again and again so what are the options you just need to uh rewrite these three lines again and again somewhere again and again okay three or four lines and this makes your code really messy right so in order to make your code readable right and if you want to just uh perform this task again and again what you can do is you can just use call this function again and again and it will just execute this three lines of code and this makes your fun this makes your code really readable and you are not you don't have to type these three lines again and again right so I can just call my function two times in my program and it will print me this again right so this is the basic use of function okay so this is how you can use basic function in PHP there are other two types of uh function declaration which are called function with argument and function that Returns value which we are going to see in the next videos so please keep watching and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
