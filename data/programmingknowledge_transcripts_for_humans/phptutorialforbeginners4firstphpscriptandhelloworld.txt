00:00 - hello guys welcome to the fourth video
00:02 - on PHP programming tutorial for
00:05 - beginners and in this video we are going
00:08 - to write our first hello world code in
00:11 - PHP so first of all uh we will start our
00:15 - apar server so go to your start menu and
00:18 - in here search for XA mppp which we have
00:23 - installed and open xmpp control panel
00:28 - from from here so open this
00:30 - Zam control
00:33 - panel and when this control panel starts
00:36 - we need to start the Apache server right
00:41 - and in this notepad++ by the meantime we
00:44 - are going to uh write our code
00:50 - and just go to your uh folder wherever
00:53 - you have installed this s XM PP server
00:57 - or xmm PP folder fer in your computer so
01:02 - in the second video I have shown you how
01:03 - to install xtp so go to that folder
01:06 - wherever you have install xmpp I have
01:09 - installed it in C and xmpp folder and in
01:13 - here I have told you that in this HT
01:17 - docs all your program files will be
01:20 - there right the these all will be there
01:23 - so what we are going to do is we are
01:24 - going to make a new folder here and we
01:27 - will call it as anything whatever you
01:30 - like for
01:32 - example
01:35 - tutoral or YouTube whatever you wish to
01:39 - write Here
01:41 - YouTube okay
01:43 - so and go in that folder and we are
01:47 - going to create a new PHP file here okay
01:51 - so just go to your notepad++ and copy
01:55 - the same location whatever you made
01:58 - right now this just copy the location of
02:00 - the folder YouTube in my case you can
02:03 - change it as your personal folder in HD
02:07 - dos remember it should be in HD docs and
02:11 - then go to your notepad plus P which we
02:14 - have installed right uh in the last
02:16 - video click this tab here right click it
02:19 - and save as and you can search for the
02:24 - path wherever you want to save it so you
02:27 - you want to save it in the same folder
02:30 - as your um as your xmpp right so here is
02:36 - my xmpp folder and HD docs and this
02:40 - folder I have uh created Youtube and in
02:44 - here I'm going to write my or create my
02:48 - first PHP program I will name it as
02:52 - test.php for example and I will save
02:56 - it and now we can start our
03:00 - programming by the meantime this um xmpp
03:04 - server has already started and in here
03:08 - when we start this server it'll still
03:12 - give you this error because in the
03:14 - config file you need to make the change
03:17 - I've already told you that in when you
03:20 - go to this config here it's 8
03:25 - right so whenever you need to start
03:29 - there this if this server will be
03:32 - started on the port at80 and not on the
03:37 - port 0
03:40 - right and uh then you for now you don't
03:43 - need to start this MySQL server we are
03:46 - not going to use this my myll database
03:49 - for now but start your Apache server
03:52 - right now let's see
03:55 - what and how we can write our first
03:59 - hello world program so every PHP Program
04:03 - start with this script of with these
04:14 - tags so it will start with uh this tag
04:19 - this smaller than symbol then question
04:22 - mark and then PHP and then it will end
04:26 - with this greater than symbol okay and
04:30 - whatever code you will write in between
04:32 - here I forgot to give this question mark
04:35 - here so the starting tag is like this
04:39 - every code which you write in PHP will
04:42 - be written in between these two tags so
04:46 - this tag is the starting tag I'll make
04:49 - it a little bit bigger so you can
04:51 - see and so every PHP code will start
04:55 - from the tags like this and end with the
04:59 - tag like this okay so we will see in
05:03 - some slides what uh does the PHP code
05:07 - look like structurally similar to C and
05:11 - C++ okay so a PHP code will be
05:14 - structurally similar to PHP uh C++ and C
05:19 - in a way that it can be it can support
05:22 - procedural language like
05:25 - C uh and it can be used as a
05:28 - objectoriented program in also to some
05:31 - degree uh which C++ is
05:35 - right uh and this object oriented part
05:38 - we will we are going to see it later but
05:42 - for now we are going to see the
05:44 - procedural part okay and all PHP
05:48 - statement end with a semicolon right and
05:53 - each PHP script must be enclosed in the
05:56 - reserved PHP tag like this and like this
06:00 - okay so I have already shown you this so
06:03 - I will go to our code here and I will
06:07 - write something to Echo so this Echo
06:12 - function we use it for printing
06:16 - something on the browser for example and
06:19 - after this EO function whatever comes in
06:22 - these double codes will be printed on
06:25 - the browser so for example
06:28 - hello
06:30 - world and remember every PHP statement
06:34 - end with semicolon so don't forget to
06:38 - add this semicolon at the end of your
06:41 - every line of the code right I will save
06:44 - this
06:45 - program and I will open my
06:51 - browser and I will write Here Local
06:55 - Host Local Host and my
07:00 - Port is 880 so Local Host colon 880 you
07:04 - need to write if you are running on Port
07:07 - 80 here not 8080 but only 80 you don't
07:11 - need to give this port
07:13 - number uh Port 80 is by default The
07:16 - Local Host Port right if you are running
07:19 - on Port other than at for example in my
07:24 - case I'm running on 8080 you need to
07:26 - give Local Host colon 8080 and the
07:29 - location of the PHP file you are
07:33 - in so if you remember we have created
07:36 - this YouTube folder and inside this we
07:38 - have this uh test.php okay so in our
07:42 - browser we will write you tube this is
07:46 - the folder and then you need to give the
07:49 - path of your text file right so just
07:52 - give
07:54 - slash
07:56 - test.php and when you run this this or
07:59 - press enter you will be able to see this
08:01 - hello world here okay
08:06 - so this is the basic code to print hello
08:09 - world right and every uh
08:13 - every code which you write in the PHP
08:17 - don't forget to end this code with this
08:21 - semicolon and always start this uh your
08:26 - PHP code with this starting tag like
08:29 - this and end with ending tag like this
08:32 - now to comment to give some comment for
08:35 - example uh we will see in the
08:39 - slides so to give the commments PHP
08:43 - support C++ or Java style comments like
08:46 - this slash double slash here it also
08:49 - supports shell style comment like this
08:52 - hash and it will also support C style
08:55 - comments like this so we will all we
08:59 - will see it all all the commments for
09:02 - example it support this supports this
09:04 - double slash and whatever you can write
09:07 - here it will be uh not executed by your
09:12 - compiler right for example I can write
09:15 - here this
09:19 - is
09:20 - uh
09:22 - hello
09:24 - world code for example okay and whatever
09:28 - code you will write in this double slash
09:32 - or for example I can write write the
09:35 - same thing using
09:36 - my hash symbol okay and I can write the
09:42 - same thing using this C style comments
09:48 - like
09:49 - this slash estx ASX slash and whatever
09:54 - you write in between this will be
09:57 - considered as a commment so you can
09:59 - provide comments in three ways in C++
10:03 - style like double slash in shell style
10:06 - using this shell or or this hash or like
10:11 - C style using this slash and estx and
10:15 - estx and Slash and this all code which
10:19 - you write in this command section will
10:21 - not be executed so I will save this file
10:24 - and once again when I refresh
10:26 - this this code will not be executed this
10:29 - is just for your reference okay
10:33 - now for example if you can you can also
10:37 - say I I I want to print this hello world
10:40 - in two different lines so I can just uh
10:44 - write hello here and World here and
10:47 - let's see what is the response response
10:49 - will always be the same okay because
10:53 - your line is ending here right and it is
10:58 - indicated by this semicolon so this code
11:01 - and this code will be considered as one
11:04 - line of code
11:06 - okay and PHP also support
11:10 - HTML tags so if you don't know how to
11:13 - use HTML I have the playlist in my
11:16 - channel you can search for this
11:18 - HTML tutorials or otherwise you don't
11:21 - even uh need to follow those if you
11:23 - don't want to it's really easy uh to uh
11:27 - understand this HTML tag
11:30 - so for example I want to break this um
11:33 - hello world and I want to print hello in
11:35 - one line and World in other line I can
11:38 - use HTML tags like these and I can give
11:42 - this Break Tag to break the line and for
11:46 - example I want to print this world in
11:48 - capital capital letters or bold letters
11:52 - so I can uh just give this bold tag here
11:57 - and and this this tag like
12:02 - this okay and when I save this and when
12:06 - I run the program or when I run this on
12:09 - the screen I will refresh this once
12:12 - again you see Hello on one line and
12:14 - World on other line and world is in
12:18 - bold letters right so this PHP supports
12:24 - HTML tags also right so this is how you
12:28 - can write your first Co program or first
12:32 - hello world program in PHP in the later
12:36 - videos I'm also going to show you how to
12:39 - uh code this PHP in uh in details so
12:45 - that's it for uh this video please RIT
12:47 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the fourth video on PHP programming tutorial for beginners and in this video we are going to write our first hello world code in PHP so first of all uh we will start our apar server so go to your start menu and in here search for XA mppp which we have installed and open xmpp control panel from from here so open this Zam control panel and when this control panel starts we need to start the Apache server right and in this notepad++ by the meantime we are going to uh write our code and just go to your uh folder wherever you have installed this s XM PP server or xmm PP folder fer in your computer so in the second video I have shown you how to install xtp so go to that folder wherever you have install xmpp I have installed it in C and xmpp folder and in here I have told you that in this HT docs all your program files will be there right the these all will be there so what we are going to do is we are going to make a new folder here and we will call it as anything whatever you like for example tutoral or YouTube whatever you wish to write Here YouTube okay so and go in that folder and we are going to create a new PHP file here okay so just go to your notepad++ and copy the same location whatever you made right now this just copy the location of the folder YouTube in my case you can change it as your personal folder in HD dos remember it should be in HD docs and then go to your notepad plus P which we have installed right uh in the last video click this tab here right click it and save as and you can search for the path wherever you want to save it so you you want to save it in the same folder as your um as your xmpp right so here is my xmpp folder and HD docs and this folder I have uh created Youtube and in here I'm going to write my or create my first PHP program I will name it as test.php for example and I will save it and now we can start our programming by the meantime this um xmpp server has already started and in here when we start this server it'll still give you this error because in the config file you need to make the change I've already told you that in when you go to this config here it's 8 right so whenever you need to start there this if this server will be started on the port at80 and not on the port 0 right and uh then you for now you don't need to start this MySQL server we are not going to use this my myll database for now but start your Apache server right now let's see what and how we can write our first hello world program so every PHP Program start with this script of with these tags so it will start with uh this tag this smaller than symbol then question mark and then PHP and then it will end with this greater than symbol okay and whatever code you will write in between here I forgot to give this question mark here so the starting tag is like this every code which you write in PHP will be written in between these two tags so this tag is the starting tag I'll make it a little bit bigger so you can see and so every PHP code will start from the tags like this and end with the tag like this okay so we will see in some slides what uh does the PHP code look like structurally similar to C and C++ okay so a PHP code will be structurally similar to PHP uh C++ and C in a way that it can be it can support procedural language like C uh and it can be used as a objectoriented program in also to some degree uh which C++ is right uh and this object oriented part we will we are going to see it later but for now we are going to see the procedural part okay and all PHP statement end with a semicolon right and each PHP script must be enclosed in the reserved PHP tag like this and like this okay so I have already shown you this so I will go to our code here and I will write something to Echo so this Echo function we use it for printing something on the browser for example and after this EO function whatever comes in these double codes will be printed on the browser so for example hello world and remember every PHP statement end with semicolon so don't forget to add this semicolon at the end of your every line of the code right I will save this program and I will open my browser and I will write Here Local Host Local Host and my Port is 880 so Local Host colon 880 you need to write if you are running on Port 80 here not 8080 but only 80 you don't need to give this port number uh Port 80 is by default The Local Host Port right if you are running on Port other than at for example in my case I'm running on 8080 you need to give Local Host colon 8080 and the location of the PHP file you are in so if you remember we have created this YouTube folder and inside this we have this uh test.php okay so in our browser we will write you tube this is the folder and then you need to give the path of your text file right so just give slash test.php and when you run this this or press enter you will be able to see this hello world here okay so this is the basic code to print hello world right and every uh every code which you write in the PHP don't forget to end this code with this semicolon and always start this uh your PHP code with this starting tag like this and end with ending tag like this now to comment to give some comment for example uh we will see in the slides so to give the commments PHP support C++ or Java style comments like this slash double slash here it also supports shell style comment like this hash and it will also support C style comments like this so we will all we will see it all all the commments for example it support this supports this double slash and whatever you can write here it will be uh not executed by your compiler right for example I can write here this is uh hello world code for example okay and whatever code you will write in this double slash or for example I can write write the same thing using my hash symbol okay and I can write the same thing using this C style comments like this slash estx ASX slash and whatever you write in between this will be considered as a commment so you can provide comments in three ways in C++ style like double slash in shell style using this shell or or this hash or like C style using this slash and estx and estx and Slash and this all code which you write in this command section will not be executed so I will save this file and once again when I refresh this this code will not be executed this is just for your reference okay now for example if you can you can also say I I I want to print this hello world in two different lines so I can just uh write hello here and World here and let's see what is the response response will always be the same okay because your line is ending here right and it is indicated by this semicolon so this code and this code will be considered as one line of code okay and PHP also support HTML tags so if you don't know how to use HTML I have the playlist in my channel you can search for this HTML tutorials or otherwise you don't even uh need to follow those if you don't want to it's really easy uh to uh understand this HTML tag so for example I want to break this um hello world and I want to print hello in one line and World in other line I can use HTML tags like these and I can give this Break Tag to break the line and for example I want to print this world in capital capital letters or bold letters so I can uh just give this bold tag here and and this this tag like this okay and when I save this and when I run the program or when I run this on the screen I will refresh this once again you see Hello on one line and World on other line and world is in bold letters right so this PHP supports HTML tags also right so this is how you can write your first Co program or first hello world program in PHP in the later videos I'm also going to show you how to uh code this PHP in uh in details so that's it for uh this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
