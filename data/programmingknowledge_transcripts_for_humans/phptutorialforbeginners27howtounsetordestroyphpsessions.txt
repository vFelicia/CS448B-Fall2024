00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to set
00:04 - sessions in PHP so I have made the
00:08 - session.php and view.php and this
00:11 - session.php what it's doing is it's just
00:14 - setting this uh session variables name
00:17 - age and weight and uh from this view.php
00:21 - we were uh uh accessing those sessions
00:26 - using this view.php right so what I have
00:31 - shown you in the last video this was the
00:32 - session.php whenever I click this it's
00:35 - setting the sessions and whenever I want
00:39 - to view the all the values from the
00:41 - session I was just uh calling this
00:44 - view.php right so if you don't know how
00:48 - to set the sessions just watch watch the
00:50 - last video now in this video I'm going
00:52 - to show you how to unset session so for
00:55 - example for some reason you want to
00:57 - unset uh some value of a session or all
01:01 - values of a session how can you do it so
01:05 - for example I will make
01:08 - uh one more PHP file
01:14 - called destroy. PHP which we will use to
01:18 - destroy our sessions okay and in here I
01:23 - will quickly make this PHP file PHP
01:28 - tags and
01:32 - then in here I want to unset the session
01:37 - right so what I can do directly we what
01:42 - uh we have learned in the last video we
01:44 - always need to use the session start
01:46 - whenever we you want to use this keyword
01:49 - session okay so we need to use the
01:53 - session start and then what we can do is
01:56 - we can unset there is a function called
02:01 - unset by which you can unset a
02:04 - particular session so for example I want
02:06 - to
02:07 - unset this name session from here okay
02:11 - so I will just pass this name session
02:14 - here with a doll symbol and this uh
02:19 - session and which is which has the value
02:21 - of name will be unset so let's try and
02:25 - run the program once again so I go to my
02:30 - browser I just refresh it and in here
02:33 - for first of all I set the session by
02:35 - session.php the session is set and then
02:40 - I can view my session by view.php so I
02:44 - know that this name is equal to Mark a
02:47 - age is equal to uh 21 and we weight is
02:50 - equal to 45 and for example I want to
02:53 - destroy the session for the name so I
02:55 - click this destroy. PHP which destroys
02:59 - the
03:00 - or unset the session name right so when
03:04 - I just open this I know that name is
03:08 - unset session name is unset now I can go
03:11 - to once again to view.php and now you
03:15 - can see
03:16 - here I can only see this uh uh age and
03:20 - weight but I am not able to see this
03:24 - name here right and this is because we
03:27 - have unset the session for name
03:32 - okay now for example you don't use this
03:37 - start session what happens quickly we
03:41 - can see here that it will not work so
03:45 - once we set the session we can view all
03:48 - name age and weight and once we destroy
03:51 - the
03:52 - session and once once again we go to
03:55 - view it will not destroy your session so
03:58 - you need to use this s session start in
04:01 - order to use any kind of session
04:04 - right now in some cases you want to
04:07 - destroy all the sessions which you said
04:10 - okay not one not two but all the session
04:13 - in AO right so how you can achieve this
04:18 - there is a function called session.
04:21 - unset or session. destroy so I'll just
04:25 - call this
04:27 - function just session uncore
04:32 - destroy and this is a function which
04:36 - destroys all of your
04:39 - sessions okay so I save it and I go to
04:44 - my browser and I set the session so
04:48 - session is set and I can view those
04:51 - session value so I know that uh name and
04:55 - age is weight is set and now I call this
04:58 - destroy. pH PHP which destroy all the
05:01 - session now I can go to view.php once
05:04 - again and I don't see any session set
05:07 - here right so in this way you can unset
05:12 - a particular session or destroy all the
05:14 - sessions using this session destroy okay
05:18 - so I hope you have enjoyed this video
05:20 - please rate comment and subscribe and
05:22 - bye for now
