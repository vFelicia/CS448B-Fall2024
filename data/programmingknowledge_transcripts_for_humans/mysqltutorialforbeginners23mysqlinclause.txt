00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video we will see that
00:05 - how to use in keyword with MySQL query
00:09 - the in keyword basically it allows you
00:13 - to determine if a specified value
00:15 - matches any value in a set of values
00:18 - that we have specified in the query you
00:23 - will understand it better if we do it
00:26 - with a example let us first open
00:30 - terminal SQL okay so let me first see
00:49 - the list of databases that we have okay
00:56 - so we have data test database here just
00:59 - use that okay let's list off tables we
01:16 - have strong table here select star from
01:24 - student okay so these are the records so
01:32 - let us see one example select star from
01:38 - [Music]
01:40 - student where let's say roll number now
01:49 - if we use in operator and then we pass
01:54 - the list of possible values let's say 5
01:58 - 0 2 5 & 4 & 5 & 8
02:08 - as you can see 5:02 rule number five and
02:13 - four and five and eight matches with the
02:15 - condition that we have specified in our
02:17 - query that's was displaying only dead
02:20 - three records you can understand that in
02:25 - operator is an alternative for our
02:28 - operator we can also write roll number
02:33 - is equal to five zero two or roll number
02:44 - is equal to I 1 4 or roll number is
02:52 - equal to 5 and 8 this will give you the
02:58 - same result but as you can observe this
03:02 - query is too lengthy as compared to this
03:06 - one because here we have to repeat the
03:09 - name of the column multiple time and in
03:12 - this we have to specify the column
03:14 - number only once and the multiple
03:18 - possible values okay let me just close
03:23 - this open - government
03:37 - let us see one more example select star
03:42 - from student wear name in let's say
03:53 - retain P - okay let me just fire this
04:04 - and it will display only one the code
04:07 - because there isn't any record which has
04:12 - the name is between I will show you
04:16 - select star student
04:24 - no there is no Bridget okay let me write
04:30 - one more Alex and we have two records
04:43 - which is name is equal to Alex
04:46 - that's why displaying two times so this
04:51 - is how you can use in keyword thanks for
04:55 - watching
