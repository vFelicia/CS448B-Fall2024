00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to the
00:02 - alteryx tutorials in this video we are
00:04 - going to talk about a few tools from the
00:07 - preparation tab in altrix
00:09 - so first of all uh we have discussed the
00:12 - tools of the in out tab that means the
00:14 - tool start would be handy when we are
00:17 - importing the data or exporting it
00:19 - now once we have imported the data we
00:22 - may need to perform some manipulations
00:23 - over the data so we would be looking at
00:25 - the tools that would help us to do the
00:28 - exact same thing the preparation tools
00:30 - okay
00:31 - so first tool that we are going to look
00:33 - for is the auto field tool the autofill
00:36 - tool we have already discussed in the
00:38 - data types video that it is used to read
00:41 - through all of the records of an input
00:43 - and set the field type to the smallest
00:45 - possible size that is related to the
00:48 - data contained in the column
00:50 - so what we are going to do is in this
00:52 - particular video see the practical
00:53 - application of the auto field tool so
00:56 - first of all what i have done is i have
00:58 - already input the data
01:00 - using the uh input data tool so
01:04 - because this is the step that we have
01:06 - done multiple times till now so we do
01:08 - not need to again see it
01:10 - next i have cleansed this data like in
01:13 - the subcategory there were some of the
01:15 - trailing white spaces so i have cleaned
01:18 - it
01:18 - and
01:19 - let me just show you how to clean it
01:20 - real quick the use of this data
01:22 - cleansing tool so let me just remove
01:24 - this tool once
01:27 - from here
01:28 - now how can you clean the data is you
01:30 - can just bring in the data cleansing
01:31 - tool or what you can do is wait for um
01:35 - alteryx to automatically bring it in
01:37 - okay so let's see how to do that
01:39 - so first of all uh you have inputted the
01:41 - data then you need to just search for
01:43 - the inconsistent blocks that is the
01:45 - subcategory go on to these three dots
01:47 - click on data cleanse remove unwanted
01:49 - characters
01:50 - leading slash trailing white space click
01:52 - on apply now once the changes have been
01:54 - applied click on this green tick icon
01:56 - that's okay so now the changes would be
01:59 - applied and you would see the data
02:01 - cleansing tool has been brought in
02:02 - automatically okay
02:04 - now its configuration panel is also
02:06 - present there which you can use to
02:09 - further clean the values but
02:11 - uh now our data is clean so we won't be
02:13 - using it anymore right the next thing we
02:16 - are going to do is use the auto field
02:18 - tool
02:20 - so let's just bring in the auto field
02:21 - tool over here
02:22 - now if you see the data preparation
02:24 - tools all have two anchors the input
02:27 - anchor and the output angle the input
02:29 - anchor is used to take the input data
02:31 - and the output anchor is used to present
02:33 - it further okay
02:35 - so this is the autofill tool as soon as
02:37 - i brought it up there is this
02:38 - configuration panel now here i can
02:40 - select the values through which you want
02:42 - to change the field type okay
02:44 - let's just clear all the values and
02:46 - select only category subcategory and
02:48 - segment from here now once we have
02:50 - selected these fields click on run
02:53 - now what will it do is it would show us
02:56 - the message box that's okay
02:58 - now let's just see the messages that um
03:01 - would actually tell us what changes it
03:03 - had made so uh the field type of segment
03:06 - has been changed to string for eight
03:08 - characters field type of category change
03:10 - to string or 15 characters and that will
03:13 - sub category to string of 11 characters
03:15 - so this is uh what the change is made by
03:18 - the auto field tool the
03:21 - uh
03:23 - the changes that it has made in these
03:25 - three fields has been shown to us in
03:27 - case we select all these fields let's
03:28 - select all
03:30 - and click on run for the auto field tool
03:32 - so what we would be getting is
03:35 - this again go to the messages so uh we
03:38 - would be getting that
03:39 - what fields it has changed to the all
03:42 - these records okay so you can see some
03:44 - of them have been changed to string some
03:45 - of them to variable string
03:47 - and so on
03:48 - like this it has made the changes
03:50 - automatically so this is the use of the
03:52 - auto field tool and the data cleansing
03:55 - tool in the preparation tab
03:57 - now uh let's just save this using ctrl s
04:01 - and move on to the next tool that is the
04:02 - filter tool
04:04 - so filter tool as the name suggests is
04:06 - used to select the data
04:09 - based upon a particular condition
04:11 - the rows of the data that made the
04:13 - condition are output to the
04:16 - uh
04:17 - screen in the form of a true anchor and
04:19 - those that do not meet the criteria are
04:21 - output in the form of a false anchor
04:24 - so if you just bring up this filter tool
04:26 - over here you can see it has three
04:28 - anchors the input anchor and in the
04:31 - output it has two anchors the true
04:32 - anchor and the false anchor so we
04:34 - specify a base condition and if the data
04:37 - meets the base condition then it goes
04:39 - into the true anchor otherwise it goes
04:41 - into the false anchor okay so let's see
04:43 - with the example
04:44 - uh let's click on this filter tool
04:47 - over here so this kind of a
04:48 - configuration box would be there now
04:50 - there are two kinds of filters that we
04:52 - can apply the basic filter or the custom
04:54 - filter in the case of the basic filter
04:56 - we can specify the basic information
04:58 - like if the um
05:01 - criteria is being matched or not if we
05:04 - want to apply some complex operations
05:06 - then we use the custom filters custom
05:09 - filters allow us to add functionalities
05:12 - to add mathematical functions the
05:14 - boolean values the if else statements
05:16 - and many more things which we would be
05:19 - of course seeing one by one but first of
05:21 - all let's take a look at the basic
05:22 - filter
05:23 - so if you remember we had a column
05:26 - called a category
05:27 - in this we had some categories like the
05:29 - furniture technology and the office
05:31 - supplies so what i'm going to do is i'm
05:34 - going to assign the furnitures
05:37 - separately that means all the categories
05:39 - where furniture is the category it would
05:41 - be assigned to a true value right so
05:43 - from the basic filter let's just select
05:44 - the column the column name is going to
05:46 - be the category column
05:48 - and equals
05:50 - let's just type in the value furniture
05:54 - okay now once you have typed it you can
05:56 - just click on run
05:58 - to run the workflow and then you would
06:00 - see that
06:03 - okay
06:04 - we have two anchors the true anchor if
06:06 - you just hover over it it would give you
06:08 - the category furniture and then we have
06:11 - is the false anchor for the category
06:12 - furniture okay
06:14 - now here are all the records that are
06:16 - being displayed in the output panel for
06:17 - the true value here you can see this is
06:19 - the true value being shown
06:20 - there are a
06:23 - 1113 records that belong to the category
06:26 - furniture okay
06:28 - so if you hover over it the category
06:30 - here is furniture only furniture
06:32 - all the way furniture but if you go to
06:34 - the false value
06:36 - then what we have is the category
06:38 - technology and office supplies
06:40 - right let's just add another filter
06:42 - anchor over here into the false part
06:46 - where what we would be doing is adding
06:48 - another base filter on the basis of the
06:50 - category let's just select the category
06:52 - again
06:53 - and it must be equal to technology
06:56 - technology
06:59 - over here okay
07:01 - click on run
07:05 - and here
07:07 - so now we again have these true false
07:10 - values for this so in the true there
07:11 - would be the technology values
07:14 - and in the false there would be the
07:15 - office supplies values so this is how we
07:18 - have used the uh basic filter tool to
07:20 - actually create three separate uh values
07:24 - for these like the furniture categories
07:26 - are separate the
07:28 - technology is separate and the office
07:30 - applies is now separate in the separate
07:31 - records okay so this is how the basic
07:34 - filter is being used now what i'm going
07:36 - to do is just i'm going to copy these
07:38 - two fields or these two tools that is
07:40 - the input tool and the data cleansing
07:41 - tool into a new workflow
07:45 - and uh show you the demonstration of the
07:48 - uh
07:49 - filter tool for the custom filter okay
07:51 - so let's just bring in our tool over
07:54 - here connect it
07:57 - and here let's just select a custom
07:59 - filter right so here is the effects
08:02 - which you can use to apply any of these
08:04 - conditions or any of these functions
08:06 - like you want to convert it
08:10 - right
08:11 - or you want to perform any kind of a
08:13 - manipulation over here you want to apply
08:16 - any of the conditional statements
08:18 - if you want to
08:19 - allow any date time
08:21 - uh applications any of the file
08:23 - applications that you can do over here
08:26 - like the string functions
08:29 - so let's just use the count words
08:32 - so i basically needed to count the words
08:34 - okay and then uh from this x you can
08:37 - just select the existing columns so i
08:38 - want it to select the count words for
08:40 - the city
08:41 - click on run
08:45 - and then
08:50 - it's going to give you the values for
08:53 - of course there won't be any false
08:55 - values right now because there could not
08:57 - be any false values for the count
08:58 - function
09:01 - and it would give you
09:02 - the count of the characters of the
09:04 - cities right
09:10 - or basically what we can do is actually
09:13 - use any kind of a basic filter like
09:15 - let's say if the profit
09:18 - is greater than equal to 1
09:21 - so that would be a profit rate so we
09:23 - have written a basic filter query but if
09:25 - you want to see how it is looking in the
09:27 - custom filter there you can apply it
09:29 - profit is greater than equal to 1.
09:31 - now if you just run it
09:33 - what you would be getting is in the two
09:35 - values the true and the false values
09:37 - so that means the records where we are
09:39 - getting a profit and the records where
09:41 - we are getting a loss in the case of the
09:43 - true are the ones where we are getting a
09:44 - profit here you can see all of these
09:46 - values we are getting a profit
09:48 - but in these values we are getting a
09:49 - loss you can see this is a loss okay so
09:53 - we just go to the messages um
09:56 - you would get that in the 4008 records
09:58 - there were the true values that means
10:00 - there is where we are getting a profit
10:02 - and the remaining 1183 values written
10:05 - false that means these are the values
10:07 - where we are getting a loss so this is
10:09 - the usage of the filter tool
10:12 - in altrix and this is how we use it so
10:15 - that's all for this video thanks for
10:17 - watching

hello everyone welcome back to the alteryx tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a few tools from the preparation tab in altrix so first of all uh we have discussed the tools of the in out tab that means the tool start would be handy when we are importing the data or exporting it now once we have imported the data we may need to perform some manipulations over the data so we would be looking at the tools that would help us to do the exact same thing the preparation tools okay so first tool that we are going to look for is the auto field tool the autofill tool we have already discussed in the data types video that it is used to read through all of the records of an input and set the field type to the smallest possible size that is related to the data contained in the column so what we are going to do is in this particular video see the practical application of the auto field tool so first of all what i have done is i have already input the data using the uh input data tool so because this is the step that we have done multiple times till now so we do not need to again see it next i have cleansed this data like in the subcategory there were some of the trailing white spaces so i have cleaned it and let me just show you how to clean it real quick the use of this data cleansing tool so let me just remove this tool once from here now how can you clean the data is you can just bring in the data cleansing tool or what you can do is wait for um alteryx to automatically bring it in okay so let's see how to do that so first of all uh you have inputted the data then you need to just search for the inconsistent blocks that is the subcategory go on to these three dots click on data cleanse remove unwanted characters leading slash trailing white space click on apply now once the changes have been applied click on this green tick icon that's okay so now the changes would be applied and you would see the data cleansing tool has been brought in automatically okay now its configuration panel is also present there which you can use to further clean the values but uh now our data is clean so we won't be using it anymore right the next thing we are going to do is use the auto field tool so let's just bring in the auto field tool over here now if you see the data preparation tools all have two anchors the input anchor and the output angle the input anchor is used to take the input data and the output anchor is used to present it further okay so this is the autofill tool as soon as i brought it up there is this configuration panel now here i can select the values through which you want to change the field type okay let's just clear all the values and select only category subcategory and segment from here now once we have selected these fields click on run now what will it do is it would show us the message box that's okay now let's just see the messages that um would actually tell us what changes it had made so uh the field type of segment has been changed to string for eight characters field type of category change to string or 15 characters and that will sub category to string of 11 characters so this is uh what the change is made by the auto field tool the uh the changes that it has made in these three fields has been shown to us in case we select all these fields let's select all and click on run for the auto field tool so what we would be getting is this again go to the messages so uh we would be getting that what fields it has changed to the all these records okay so you can see some of them have been changed to string some of them to variable string and so on like this it has made the changes automatically so this is the use of the auto field tool and the data cleansing tool in the preparation tab now uh let's just save this using ctrl s and move on to the next tool that is the filter tool so filter tool as the name suggests is used to select the data based upon a particular condition the rows of the data that made the condition are output to the uh screen in the form of a true anchor and those that do not meet the criteria are output in the form of a false anchor so if you just bring up this filter tool over here you can see it has three anchors the input anchor and in the output it has two anchors the true anchor and the false anchor so we specify a base condition and if the data meets the base condition then it goes into the true anchor otherwise it goes into the false anchor okay so let's see with the example uh let's click on this filter tool over here so this kind of a configuration box would be there now there are two kinds of filters that we can apply the basic filter or the custom filter in the case of the basic filter we can specify the basic information like if the um criteria is being matched or not if we want to apply some complex operations then we use the custom filters custom filters allow us to add functionalities to add mathematical functions the boolean values the if else statements and many more things which we would be of course seeing one by one but first of all let's take a look at the basic filter so if you remember we had a column called a category in this we had some categories like the furniture technology and the office supplies so what i'm going to do is i'm going to assign the furnitures separately that means all the categories where furniture is the category it would be assigned to a true value right so from the basic filter let's just select the column the column name is going to be the category column and equals let's just type in the value furniture okay now once you have typed it you can just click on run to run the workflow and then you would see that okay we have two anchors the true anchor if you just hover over it it would give you the category furniture and then we have is the false anchor for the category furniture okay now here are all the records that are being displayed in the output panel for the true value here you can see this is the true value being shown there are a 1113 records that belong to the category furniture okay so if you hover over it the category here is furniture only furniture all the way furniture but if you go to the false value then what we have is the category technology and office supplies right let's just add another filter anchor over here into the false part where what we would be doing is adding another base filter on the basis of the category let's just select the category again and it must be equal to technology technology over here okay click on run and here so now we again have these true false values for this so in the true there would be the technology values and in the false there would be the office supplies values so this is how we have used the uh basic filter tool to actually create three separate uh values for these like the furniture categories are separate the technology is separate and the office applies is now separate in the separate records okay so this is how the basic filter is being used now what i'm going to do is just i'm going to copy these two fields or these two tools that is the input tool and the data cleansing tool into a new workflow and uh show you the demonstration of the uh filter tool for the custom filter okay so let's just bring in our tool over here connect it and here let's just select a custom filter right so here is the effects which you can use to apply any of these conditions or any of these functions like you want to convert it right or you want to perform any kind of a manipulation over here you want to apply any of the conditional statements if you want to allow any date time uh applications any of the file applications that you can do over here like the string functions so let's just use the count words so i basically needed to count the words okay and then uh from this x you can just select the existing columns so i want it to select the count words for the city click on run and then it's going to give you the values for of course there won't be any false values right now because there could not be any false values for the count function and it would give you the count of the characters of the cities right or basically what we can do is actually use any kind of a basic filter like let's say if the profit is greater than equal to 1 so that would be a profit rate so we have written a basic filter query but if you want to see how it is looking in the custom filter there you can apply it profit is greater than equal to 1. now if you just run it what you would be getting is in the two values the true and the false values so that means the records where we are getting a profit and the records where we are getting a loss in the case of the true are the ones where we are getting a profit here you can see all of these values we are getting a profit but in these values we are getting a loss you can see this is a loss okay so we just go to the messages um you would get that in the 4008 records there were the true values that means there is where we are getting a profit and the remaining 1183 values written false that means these are the values where we are getting a loss so this is the usage of the filter tool in altrix and this is how we use it so that's all for this video thanks for watching
