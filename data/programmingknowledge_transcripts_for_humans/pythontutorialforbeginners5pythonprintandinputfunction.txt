00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python to troll for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how to use print
00:06 - function in order to print output on the
00:09 - console in various different ways and
00:12 - I'm also going to show you how to take
00:14 - user input using Python so we have
00:18 - already seen that in Python we can use
00:21 - this print function in order to print
00:24 - something and we have already a printed
00:26 - hello world at the time of installation
00:30 - right and when I press ENTER it's going
00:33 - to print hello world on the console now
00:35 - some of you might wonder what is this
00:37 - print so print is a inbuilt
00:42 - function in Python so python has a
00:45 - number of inbuilt function and print is
00:48 - one of them so here
00:51 - print is a function and then inside the
00:54 - parentheses what you give here is called
00:58 - a parameter or an argument ok so hello
01:03 - world is an argument which is a string
01:06 - argument right so let's try to give in
01:10 - this print an integer argument let's say
01:14 - I just provide 25 here and it will print
01:17 - this number once again let's say I'm
01:20 - going to write print and then I want to
01:23 - execute some expression 50 x 60 and then
01:28 - press Enter
01:28 - print function is also able to do this
01:31 - now let's say I want to output some more
01:34 - complex formatted string so let's say I
01:38 - want to print on the console 50 x 10 is
01:42 - equal to 60 how can I do this so let's
01:46 - see how we can do it so I can write
01:48 - print here and then inside these double
01:50 - quotes you can write your string for
01:53 - example 50 x 10 and then in print
01:57 - function you can give multiple arguments
01:59 - using this comma separator so here I can
02:03 - just write 50 x 10 and let me put equals
02:09 - symbol here inside this string and then
02:12 - press Enter
02:13 - and now it prints 50 x 10 equals 500 and
02:20 - you can also provide more than one
02:22 - argument to this print function so for
02:25 - example I can just write hello here and
02:29 - then in the second argument I will just
02:31 - provide the space between hello and
02:34 - world and in this third argument I will
02:36 - just a world here and this print
02:38 - function will concatenate all these
02:40 - string values and give you the output in
02:44 - this format now let's say you want to
02:45 - also provide at this value here which is
02:48 - 50 and 10 instead of string you want to
02:51 - provide some value which you take from a
02:54 - variable so for example you declare a
02:57 - variable X is equal to 50 here and then
03:01 - Y is equal to 10 and you want to use
03:05 - these two variables instead of this
03:07 - static string so how you can achieve
03:10 - this you can achieve this in various
03:12 - different ways so let me show you the
03:14 - first way so I can write print and then
03:17 - in the double quotes this is your string
03:19 - so whenever you use this double quotes
03:22 - and whenever you write something in
03:25 - between this double quotes it becomes a
03:27 - string so after this string I will
03:29 - provide a dot here and wait for some
03:31 - seconds and as soon as you do this you
03:34 - will be able to see various different
03:37 - hints here which are provided so these
03:39 - are all the inbuilt methods which you
03:42 - can use with the string so you can use
03:46 - find method you can use format method so
03:50 - for now we are going to use this format
03:52 - method with strings so you can just
03:54 - click on this format method so let's say
03:57 - I will provide X as the first argument Y
04:01 - as the second argument and I want to see
04:05 - the output of X multiplied by Y in the
04:10 - third argument now how you can print the
04:12 - value of x Y and the multiplication of X
04:15 - Y using this blank string so it turns
04:19 - out that you can use these curly
04:22 - brackets inside the string and you can
04:26 - give some
04:26 - index here so index starts from zero so
04:29 - this index is index zero and then I'm
04:33 - going to provide space and then this
04:36 - Asterix symbol to provide this kind of
04:38 - format so we want to achieve this format
04:40 - here right so just write zero in the
04:43 - curly bracket space Astrix and once
04:46 - again curly bracket and this time we are
04:49 - going to provide the index one and the
04:51 - result will be transferred to index two
04:54 - why because here the index starts from
04:58 - zero so X will be transferred to the
05:00 - index zero Y will be transferred to the
05:04 - index one and the multiplication of x
05:06 - and y will be transferred to index two
05:09 - here so let me press ENTER here and you
05:12 - can see it prints the string which we
05:14 - desire now once again I'm going to write
05:17 - this print function and once again I'm
05:19 - going to give this parenthesis and you
05:20 - can see the hint here so I want to use
05:24 - this SCP keyword now inside the string
05:28 - so how can I use this so I will just
05:30 - close this parenthesis and once again I
05:32 - want to print hello world so I will just
05:34 - write hello and then I'm going to
05:37 - provide the comma and inside the double
05:40 - quotes I'm going to just write world
05:42 - here and then in the last argument you
05:45 - can provide this keyword SCP is equal to
05:49 - and inside the double quotes you can
05:50 - provide some separator to separate the
05:53 - hollow from world so I want to just give
05:57 - this string to separate hello from world
05:59 - and now I'm going to press ENTER and you
06:02 - can see this string is separating the
06:04 - keyword hello from the world now in
06:07 - Python you can also use C style string
06:11 - formatting to create a new formatted
06:13 - string so let me show you how we can do
06:15 - it so I'm going to declare a variable
06:17 - called name and I'm going to assign some
06:19 - value to it for example Maxia and then
06:22 - press enter and now I'm going to just
06:25 - write print function and in the
06:28 - parenthesis I want to just greet this
06:31 - name so I can just write double quotes
06:35 - hello here and then if you are familiar
06:38 - with C style string formatting
06:40 - then you may know this modulo s symbol
06:43 - which is used to print strings right and
06:47 - then after this double quote you just
06:49 - need to provide once again this modulo
06:52 - symbol and then you need to provide the
06:55 - variable name which you want to replace
06:57 - instead of this modulo s so in our case
07:01 - we want to replace this modulo s by name
07:05 - variable and I'm going to press ENTER
07:08 - and you can see it prints hello max now
07:12 - let's say I also have the age of this
07:15 - person so the age is let's say 22 and
07:19 - once again I'm going to use this print
07:21 - function and inside the parentheses I
07:24 - want to say hello to the name including
07:28 - the age so I can just write hello and
07:31 - then modulo s here and then I'm going to
07:34 - print the age of this person I can just
07:38 - write re u modulo D which is used to
07:42 - print the integer values and then I'm
07:45 - going to just write years old and after
07:48 - the double quotes I can just write
07:51 - modular and this time I cannot simply
07:53 - provide this name argument like this I
07:57 - must provide the name in the form of a
07:59 - couple and what is a tuple a tuple is a
08:03 - fixed size list and we are going to see
08:07 - in the future videos how to use tuples
08:09 - but for now just remember that a double
08:12 - is a fixed size list okay
08:16 - so inside these parentheses once again I
08:19 - can provide first of all the name and
08:22 - then as a second value in the tuple I
08:24 - can provide the age variable and now I'm
08:28 - going to press ENTER and now you can see
08:31 - it prints hello max are you 22 years old
08:35 - so this is how also you can use these C
08:39 - styled string formatting in Python I
08:42 - want to give you one more example of
08:45 - float here so I can just write for
08:48 - example this person's marks so I'm going
08:50 - to just write marks is equal to and
08:53 - let's say I want to provide these
08:54 - Mark's in the floating point so I can
08:56 - give this modulo F here and then after
09:00 - this modulo I can just give the mark so
09:03 - ninety two point five and then press
09:05 - ENTER and you can see it prints the
09:08 - marks now one more little thing which we
09:10 - can do here is we can limit the number
09:13 - of decimal values which we want to see
09:15 - after this point so we can write the
09:18 - same printf function and same argument
09:22 - and in order to limit the number of
09:25 - digits after the decimal you just need
09:28 - to write after F dot and some number for
09:32 - example two oops I don't want to see
09:35 - this output I wanted to see the output
09:38 - after the decimal value so once again I
09:42 - think this should be this point should
09:45 - be before F so I just need to write dot
09:48 - and two before F I think and then press
09:52 - ENTER and now it limits the number of
09:55 - digits after this decimal point now the
09:58 - last thing I want to show here is how
10:00 - you can allow the user to provide some
10:03 - input so for example I will declare a
10:05 - variable called value and then I can use
10:09 - equals and then I'm going to use a
10:12 - inbuilt function which is called input
10:14 - so input is also an inbuilt function
10:18 - which allows you to take user input so
10:22 - here I can just write as the first
10:24 - argument and then I will provide this
10:26 - colon here and that's it you just need
10:29 - to press ENTER here and now you can see
10:31 - this terminal is asking us the same
10:34 - question which we have written here so
10:37 - let's say I just provide 50 here and
10:39 - then press ENTER then what's going to
10:41 - happen is this 50 is going to be
10:45 - assigned to this variable which is value
10:48 - so now when you just use this value
10:52 - variable you can see this 50 is assigned
10:55 - to this value variable you will also see
10:58 - that this 50 is a string and not a
11:01 - number right because it's enclosed in
11:04 - single quotes so how you can assign 50
11:08 - to this value using the user input so
11:12 - what we can do here is once again I'm
11:14 - going to use this value variable and
11:17 - what we can do here is we can typecast
11:21 - the output of input so you can just
11:24 - write int and then here inside the
11:27 - parentheses you can just write and now
11:30 - when I press Enter
11:31 - and provide 50 and then press Enter and
11:34 - see the value now it's an integer right
11:38 - so you can typecast the output of this
11:41 - input function which provides us the
11:43 - string and this int method is going to
11:47 - convert this string into an integer and
11:49 - then give us the result instead of this
11:52 - int you can also use a float keyword
11:55 - here so let me show you this example
11:57 - also so I'm going to just copy this and
12:00 - paste it here and instead of using the
12:04 - int I'm going to just write float here
12:08 - okay and then press ENTER and I'm going
12:10 - to provide this time hundred here and
12:12 - then press Enter and then I'm going to
12:15 - just print the value of the value
12:18 - variable and now it prints the answer in
12:21 - floating points so this is how you can
12:24 - use print function to print the output
12:26 - on the console and input function to
12:29 - take the input from the user I hope you
12:33 - have enjoyed this video I will see you
12:35 - in the next video so bye for now

hey guys welcome to the next video on Python to troll for beginners in this video we will see how to use print function in order to print output on the console in various different ways and I'm also going to show you how to take user input using Python so we have already seen that in Python we can use this print function in order to print something and we have already a printed hello world at the time of installation right and when I press ENTER it's going to print hello world on the console now some of you might wonder what is this print so print is a inbuilt function in Python so python has a number of inbuilt function and print is one of them so here print is a function and then inside the parentheses what you give here is called a parameter or an argument ok so hello world is an argument which is a string argument right so let's try to give in this print an integer argument let's say I just provide 25 here and it will print this number once again let's say I'm going to write print and then I want to execute some expression 50 x 60 and then press Enter print function is also able to do this now let's say I want to output some more complex formatted string so let's say I want to print on the console 50 x 10 is equal to 60 how can I do this so let's see how we can do it so I can write print here and then inside these double quotes you can write your string for example 50 x 10 and then in print function you can give multiple arguments using this comma separator so here I can just write 50 x 10 and let me put equals symbol here inside this string and then press Enter and now it prints 50 x 10 equals 500 and you can also provide more than one argument to this print function so for example I can just write hello here and then in the second argument I will just provide the space between hello and world and in this third argument I will just a world here and this print function will concatenate all these string values and give you the output in this format now let's say you want to also provide at this value here which is 50 and 10 instead of string you want to provide some value which you take from a variable so for example you declare a variable X is equal to 50 here and then Y is equal to 10 and you want to use these two variables instead of this static string so how you can achieve this you can achieve this in various different ways so let me show you the first way so I can write print and then in the double quotes this is your string so whenever you use this double quotes and whenever you write something in between this double quotes it becomes a string so after this string I will provide a dot here and wait for some seconds and as soon as you do this you will be able to see various different hints here which are provided so these are all the inbuilt methods which you can use with the string so you can use find method you can use format method so for now we are going to use this format method with strings so you can just click on this format method so let's say I will provide X as the first argument Y as the second argument and I want to see the output of X multiplied by Y in the third argument now how you can print the value of x Y and the multiplication of X Y using this blank string so it turns out that you can use these curly brackets inside the string and you can give some index here so index starts from zero so this index is index zero and then I'm going to provide space and then this Asterix symbol to provide this kind of format so we want to achieve this format here right so just write zero in the curly bracket space Astrix and once again curly bracket and this time we are going to provide the index one and the result will be transferred to index two why because here the index starts from zero so X will be transferred to the index zero Y will be transferred to the index one and the multiplication of x and y will be transferred to index two here so let me press ENTER here and you can see it prints the string which we desire now once again I'm going to write this print function and once again I'm going to give this parenthesis and you can see the hint here so I want to use this SCP keyword now inside the string so how can I use this so I will just close this parenthesis and once again I want to print hello world so I will just write hello and then I'm going to provide the comma and inside the double quotes I'm going to just write world here and then in the last argument you can provide this keyword SCP is equal to and inside the double quotes you can provide some separator to separate the hollow from world so I want to just give this string to separate hello from world and now I'm going to press ENTER and you can see this string is separating the keyword hello from the world now in Python you can also use C style string formatting to create a new formatted string so let me show you how we can do it so I'm going to declare a variable called name and I'm going to assign some value to it for example Maxia and then press enter and now I'm going to just write print function and in the parenthesis I want to just greet this name so I can just write double quotes hello here and then if you are familiar with C style string formatting then you may know this modulo s symbol which is used to print strings right and then after this double quote you just need to provide once again this modulo symbol and then you need to provide the variable name which you want to replace instead of this modulo s so in our case we want to replace this modulo s by name variable and I'm going to press ENTER and you can see it prints hello max now let's say I also have the age of this person so the age is let's say 22 and once again I'm going to use this print function and inside the parentheses I want to say hello to the name including the age so I can just write hello and then modulo s here and then I'm going to print the age of this person I can just write re u modulo D which is used to print the integer values and then I'm going to just write years old and after the double quotes I can just write modular and this time I cannot simply provide this name argument like this I must provide the name in the form of a couple and what is a tuple a tuple is a fixed size list and we are going to see in the future videos how to use tuples but for now just remember that a double is a fixed size list okay so inside these parentheses once again I can provide first of all the name and then as a second value in the tuple I can provide the age variable and now I'm going to press ENTER and now you can see it prints hello max are you 22 years old so this is how also you can use these C styled string formatting in Python I want to give you one more example of float here so I can just write for example this person's marks so I'm going to just write marks is equal to and let's say I want to provide these Mark's in the floating point so I can give this modulo F here and then after this modulo I can just give the mark so ninety two point five and then press ENTER and you can see it prints the marks now one more little thing which we can do here is we can limit the number of decimal values which we want to see after this point so we can write the same printf function and same argument and in order to limit the number of digits after the decimal you just need to write after F dot and some number for example two oops I don't want to see this output I wanted to see the output after the decimal value so once again I think this should be this point should be before F so I just need to write dot and two before F I think and then press ENTER and now it limits the number of digits after this decimal point now the last thing I want to show here is how you can allow the user to provide some input so for example I will declare a variable called value and then I can use equals and then I'm going to use a inbuilt function which is called input so

here and now you can see this terminal is asking us the same question which we have written here so let's say I just provide 50 here and then press ENTER then what's going to happen is this 50 is going to be assigned to this variable which is value so now when you just use this value variable you can see this 50 is assigned to this value variable you will also see that this 50 is a string and not a number right because it's enclosed in single quotes so how you can assign 50 to this value using the user input so what we can do here is once again I'm going to use this value variable and what we can do here is we can typecast the output of input so you can just write int and then here inside the parentheses you can just write and now when I press Enter and provide 50 and then press Enter and see the value now it's an integer right so you can typecast the output of this input function which provides us the string and this int method is going to convert this string into an integer and then give us the result instead of this int you can also use a float keyword here so let me show you this example also so I'm going to just copy this and paste it here and instead of using the int I'm going to just write float here okay and then press ENTER and I'm going to provide this time hundred here and then press Enter and then I'm going to just print the value of the value variable and now it prints the answer in floating points so this is how you can use print function to print the output on the console and input function to take the input from the user I hope you have enjoyed this video I will see you in the next video so bye for now
