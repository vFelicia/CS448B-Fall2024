00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:03 - use mongodb on your windows 11 operating
00:06 - system
00:07 - so first of all what is mongodb
00:09 - so mongodb is a cross platform document
00:13 - oriented database program which is also
00:16 - classified as a nosql database right
00:20 - so mongodb is one of the most popular
00:23 - nosql database programs which we can use
00:27 - so let's see how we can download it
00:29 - first and then we will see how we can
00:31 - install and use it
00:33 - so first of all open your favorite
00:34 - browser and search for mongodb and the
00:36 - first result which will appear here will
00:39 - be from mongodb.com
00:41 - so i'm going to click on this
00:42 - mongodb.com website which is going to
00:45 - redirect me to this web page now on this
00:49 - mongodb.com website
00:51 - you will be able to see these tabs here
00:54 - we need to hover over the product tab
00:57 - and then just move to the community
01:00 - addition section here right so we need
01:03 - to download the community server which
01:06 - is the free
01:07 - to use community server so just hover
01:10 - over community edition and then click on
01:13 - community server here which is going to
01:16 - redirect us to the downloads page
01:19 - and you can see there are
01:22 - many variants of this mongodb servers
01:25 - are available you want to download this
01:28 - one which is mongodb community server
01:31 - and from here you will be able to select
01:34 - the version of mongodb which you want to
01:36 - install
01:37 - i'm going to install the current stable
01:39 - version which is
01:41 - 5.0.5 at the time of making this video
01:44 - the platform is windows obviously and
01:46 - the package i want to download is in the
01:50 - msi format there is also this zip format
01:53 - which you can download but for now i'm
01:55 - going to select msi here and then click
01:57 - on download which is going to start the
01:59 - download of this mongodb windows dot msi
02:03 - file so just wait for the download to
02:05 - complete so once this msi file is
02:08 - downloaded i'm going to click on this
02:10 - msi file and let me minimize my browser
02:13 - and you can see the mongodb installer is
02:16 - started now so on this first window you
02:19 - don't need to do anything you just need
02:20 - to verify the version and then click on
02:22 - next
02:24 - and on the next page you will see the
02:26 - license terms and conditions agreement
02:29 - if you agree with this just check this
02:31 - check box and then click on next
02:34 - and then you need to choose the setup
02:36 - type so we are going to choose the
02:38 - complete setup for mongodb so i'm going
02:41 - to just select this
02:43 - and then
02:44 - you will see this kind of window
02:48 - now here
02:49 - you can see the install mongodb as a
02:52 - service selected
02:54 - and i'm going to leave this first option
02:56 - as run service as network service user
03:00 - and then you have the service name which
03:03 - is going to be called mongodb which is
03:05 - okay and these are the data and log
03:07 - directories where your mongodb will be
03:10 - installed and it will save its data and
03:14 - it will save its log
03:16 - so if you don't have the good reason to
03:18 - change this location just leave
03:20 - everything as default and then click on
03:22 - next and on the next window it says
03:25 - install mongodb compass right
03:28 - so mongodb compass is the official
03:31 - graphical user interface for mongodb
03:34 - which you can install and use so why not
03:38 - we are going to install mongodb with
03:40 - mongodb compass so just leave this
03:43 - checkbox as checked and then click on
03:45 - next
03:46 - and then click on install but first of
03:49 - all it's going to show you this warning
03:51 - which says do you want to allow this app
03:53 - to make changes on your device i trust
03:56 - this app so i'm going to click on yes
03:58 - here which is going to start the
03:59 - installation
04:00 - process so just wait for this process to
04:03 - complete so now i can see that mongodb
04:06 - compass has been started and you can see
04:09 - it looks like this
04:11 - and also the installation of mongodb has
04:14 - been finished right
04:15 - so first of all let me minimize this
04:17 - compass and you can see this
04:21 - installation of mongodb has been
04:22 - finished so i'm going to click on this
04:25 - finish button so now once mongodb is
04:27 - installed on your windows 11 operating
04:29 - system how we can check whether
04:31 - everything is working fine or not
04:34 - so
04:34 - the best way is to just open your
04:37 - command prompt so just search for cmd
04:40 - here and then open the command prompt
04:43 - and once the command prompt is open you
04:45 - need to give command so just write
04:49 -  here and then press enter
04:51 - but it says is not recognized as
04:54 - an internal or external command and why
04:57 - it's showing this message you might have
04:59 - guessed it right because we haven't set
05:01 - the environment variable for mongodb so
05:04 - let's go to the location where mongodb
05:06 - is installed on our windows 11 operating
05:08 - system it's in c directory and then
05:11 - program files
05:13 - and then there will be this mongodb
05:16 - directory and then there will be server
05:19 - the version
05:20 - and then
05:21 - you will see this bin directory here
05:23 - where all of your mongodb related
05:26 - executable files are here the two files
05:29 - which are of interest to us are
05:32 - mongo.exe file and
05:34 - mongod.exe file
05:36 - so what we are going to do so we are
05:38 - going to simply copy this path until bin
05:41 - and then
05:42 - i'm going to just uh click on search
05:43 - once again and then search for
05:45 - environment variables and when you type
05:47 - first few letters of environment you
05:50 - will see uh this result which says edit
05:53 - system environment variables click on it
05:56 - which is going to open this kind of
05:58 - window
05:59 - here click on environment variables and
06:02 - then under system variables
06:04 - click on the path
06:07 - environment variable and then double
06:08 - click on it
06:10 - and here we are going to add this new
06:12 - path
06:13 - which is for mongodb
06:16 - executable files so this is the path
06:18 - which we have copied so i'm going to
06:20 - paste this path and then press enter and
06:22 - then click on ok
06:24 - ok and once again i'm going to click on
06:26 - ok so once your environment variables
06:29 - are set i'm going to open the command
06:31 - prompt once again
06:32 - and here once again i can give the
06:35 - command so i'm going to just write
06:37 -  and then press enter and this time
06:39 - it's going to show me
06:41 - this version of and it has opened
06:44 - the shell right
06:46 - so in the shell you can give your
06:50 - mongod related commands for example if
06:52 - you want to
06:54 - view all the databases you need to give
06:56 - this command show
06:58 - dbs and then semicolon and then press
07:01 - enter
07:02 - and it's going to show you all the
07:04 - databases now in order to create a new
07:06 - database in mongodb
07:08 - in the shell you need to give this
07:10 - command so you can just
07:13 - write use and the name of your database
07:16 - so i'm going to name my database as
07:20 - let's say my
07:21 - db which is simple and then press enter
07:24 - and you can see it says switched to db
07:28 - mydb so once this database is created we
07:30 - can give this showdbs command again and
07:34 - check whether this database is created
07:36 - or not so just
07:38 - write show dbs
07:39 - but still you can see
07:41 - you will not see the name of your
07:43 - database which you have created and why
07:46 - is that
07:47 - because until and unless you fill your
07:50 - database with some documents
07:54 - you will not see it here so if your
07:56 - database is empty
07:58 - it's not going to show you the database
08:00 - right so we need to fill our database
08:04 - with some data
08:06 - so in order to fill our database with
08:09 - some data we can give this command so we
08:11 - have already given this use my db
08:14 - command and we are inside this
08:18 - mydb database you can see switched to
08:20 - dbmydb
08:22 - so now
08:23 - we can give this command db which means
08:26 - we want to execute some command in my db
08:30 - because we are inside mydb database and
08:33 - then
08:34 - you need to give the name of the
08:36 - collection which you want to create
08:38 - inside your database
08:40 - i'm going to name my collection as books
08:43 - let's say right
08:45 - and then you need to write dot and then
08:48 - write insert
08:50 - and then in these parentheses
08:53 - you can give any
08:55 - key value appear in the form of json
08:58 - inside these parentheses so i'm going to
09:00 - just
09:01 - give my
09:02 - values in the form of json so let's say
09:05 - i want to just give the name of
09:08 - the book
09:09 - and that i can do by just giving this
09:13 - kind of
09:14 - json value so my
09:17 - mongodb
09:19 - book and then i'm going to add the
09:21 - semicolon here and then press enter
09:23 - and it says
09:25 - write result inserted 1 that means our
09:30 - document is inserted in this collection
09:33 - so now
09:35 - we can view the database when we give
09:39 - the show dbs command so when you press
09:42 - this upper arrow on your keyboard you
09:46 - will see all the previous commands so
09:48 - you can always
09:50 - give this show dbs command and you can
09:53 - see now it's visible right so mydb is
09:57 - visible here because we have one
09:59 - document inside our database now in
10:02 - order to view all the collections inside
10:04 - your database you give this command show
10:07 - collections and then semicolon and then
10:09 - press enter and it's going to show you
10:11 - all the collections inside your database
10:14 - we have created only one connection with
10:17 - the name books and that is shown here
10:20 - now in order to view
10:22 - the data or documents inside the
10:24 - collection
10:26 - you give this command so you need to
10:28 - write the
10:29 - database name or db because we are
10:32 - already using this uh database right by
10:35 - using use mydb command so db and then
10:39 - give the name of your collection in our
10:42 - case it's book
10:43 - and then just write find and then just
10:46 - add these parentheses semicolon press
10:49 - enter and it's going to show you all the
10:51 - documents inside your books collection
10:54 - and there is this one document which is
10:57 - present inside our collection mongodb
11:00 - automatically adds this id to every
11:04 - document so this is added by mongodb
11:07 - automatically
11:08 - and this is the data which you have
11:11 - provided so this is how you can use the
11:13 -  shell in your command prompt right
11:16 - let me minimize this
11:18 - so we have also installed the
11:21 - compass right so if it's not open you
11:25 - can always click on this icon which is
11:27 - created on the desktop and it's going to
11:30 - open the compass here
11:32 - for the first time when it starts it's
11:34 - going to show you this kind of
11:37 - window so i'm going to click on all
11:39 - these next values and then i'm going to
11:42 - click on get started so i'm going to
11:44 - leave everything as default and then
11:46 - click on start using compass
11:49 - and now i can start using mongodb
11:52 - compass and it's a gui application so i
11:55 - will be able to visualize my data in my
11:57 - mongodb
11:59 - in a better way so in order to create a
12:01 - new database connection i need to click
12:03 - on connect and then new connection
12:06 - and it's going to
12:08 - open this new window for me
12:10 - otherwise you can
12:12 - already see that this window is already
12:15 - there now what it says here paste your
12:17 - connection string so if you know little
12:20 - bit about mongodb
12:22 - in order to connect to our database we
12:24 - need a connection string you can also
12:27 - know more about this connection string
12:29 - by clicking on this info icon here and
12:32 - it will redirect you to this uh
12:34 - web page where you can read more about
12:37 - this mongodb connection so what will be
12:39 - the connection string in our case
12:42 - so when you go to the shell once
12:44 - again and when you have given this
12:46 - command on your command prompt
12:48 - you will be able to see this connection
12:51 - string here so it's mongodb colon
12:54 - forward slash forward slash
12:57 - 127.0.0.1 which is our localhost this is
13:00 - the port at which mongodb has been
13:03 - started so our connection string will be
13:06 - this one
13:07 - but the essential part of the connection
13:10 - string is up to this port right so you
13:12 - need to give
13:14 - this connection string
13:16 - and after that these parameters are
13:18 - optional you can give them or you can
13:21 - just leave them
13:23 - so let's give this kind of connection
13:25 - string
13:26 - on your mongodb documentation also you
13:29 - will see the same
13:32 - documentation that you need to give the
13:34 - connection string in this format so if
13:36 - you are using some host name you can
13:39 - give the host name in the middle let's
13:41 - copy this and then i'm going to go to
13:44 - the compass and then paste this
13:47 - here and instead of this
13:50 - host name i need to give the local host
13:52 - here right which is 127.0.0.1
13:57 - right
13:58 - so this is the connection string i'm
14:00 - going to click on connect which is going
14:02 - to connect to mongodb server and now you
14:05 - can see the connection is successful and
14:07 - on the left hand side you will be able
14:08 - to see on which host and port it's
14:10 - running
14:11 - and then you will be able to see all the
14:13 - databases right so this is the list of
14:16 - all the databases
14:17 - and this is the database which we have
14:20 - created which is called mydb right using
14:23 - the shell
14:25 - right now you can see it contains only
14:28 - one document so let's click on this
14:31 - and you can see this document is now
14:34 - visible here right
14:37 - so using this mongodb compass it's
14:40 - really easy to visualize your data
14:42 - inside
14:43 - your mongodb you can also perform
14:46 - aggregation queries you can also view
14:48 - the schema
14:50 - explain plan indexes and you can also do
14:53 - the validation
14:55 - using this mongodb compass very easily
14:58 - so this is how you can download and
15:00 - install mongodb on your windows 11
15:04 - operating system i hope you've enjoyed
15:06 - this video and i will see you in the
15:08 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install and use mongodb on your windows 11 operating system so first of all what is mongodb so mongodb is a cross platform document oriented database program which is also classified as a nosql database right so mongodb is one of the most popular nosql database programs which we can use so let's see how we can download it first and then we will see how we can install and use it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for mongodb and the first result which will appear here will be from mongodb.com so i'm going to click on this mongodb.com website which is going to redirect me to this web page now on this mongodb.com website you will be able to see these tabs here we need to hover over the product tab and then just move to the community addition section here right so we need to download the community server which is the free to use community server so just hover over community edition and then click on community server here which is going to redirect us to the downloads page and you can see there are many variants of this mongodb servers are available you want to download this one which is mongodb community server and from here you will be able to select the version of mongodb which you want to install i'm going to install the current stable version which is 5.0.5 at the time of making this video the platform is windows obviously and the package i want to download is in the msi format there is also this zip format which you can download but for now i'm going to select msi here and then click on download which is going to start the download of this mongodb windows dot msi file so just wait for the download to complete so once this msi file is downloaded i'm going to click on this msi file and let me minimize my browser and you can see the mongodb installer is started now so on this first window you don't need to do anything you just need to verify the version and then click on next and on the next page you will see the license terms and conditions agreement if you agree with this just check this check box and then click on next and then you need to choose the setup type so we are going to choose the complete setup for mongodb so i'm going to just select this and then you will see this kind of window now here you can see the install mongodb as a service selected and i'm going to leave this first option as run service as network service user and then you have the service name which is going to be called mongodb which is okay and these are the data and log directories where your mongodb will be installed and it will save its data and it will save its log so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave everything as default and then click on next and on the next window it says install mongodb compass right so mongodb compass is the official graphical user interface for mongodb which you can install and use so why not we are going to install mongodb with mongodb compass so just leave this checkbox as checked and then click on next and then click on install but first of all it's going to show you this warning which says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device i trust this app so i'm going to click on yes here which is going to start the installation process so just wait for this process to complete so now i can see that mongodb compass has been started and you can see it looks like this and also the installation of mongodb has been finished right so first of all let me minimize this compass and you can see this installation of mongodb has been finished so i'm going to click on this finish button so now once mongodb is installed on your windows 11 operating system how we can check whether everything is working fine or not so the best way is to just open your command prompt so just search for cmd here and then open the command prompt and once the command prompt is open you need to give command so just write here and then press enter but it says is not recognized as an internal or external command and why it's showing this message you might have guessed it right because we haven't set the environment variable for mongodb so let's go to the location where mongodb is installed on our windows 11 operating system it's in c directory and then program files and then there will be this mongodb directory and then there will be server the version and then you will see this bin directory here where all of your mongodb related executable files are here the two files which are of interest to us are mongo.exe file and mongod.exe file so what we are going to do so we are going to simply copy this path until bin and then i'm going to just uh click on search once again and then search for environment variables and when you type first few letters of environment you will see uh this result which says edit system environment variables click on it which is going to open this kind of window here click on environment variables and then under system variables click on the path environment variable and then double click on it and here we are going to add this new path which is for mongodb executable files so this is the path which we have copied so i'm going to paste this path and then press enter and then click on ok ok and once again i'm going to click on ok so once your environment variables are set i'm going to open the command prompt once again and here once again i can give the command so i'm going to just write and then press enter and this time it's going to show me this version of and it has opened the shell right so in the shell you can give your mongod related commands for example if you want to view all the databases you need to give this command show dbs and then semicolon and then press enter and it's going to show you all the databases now in order to create a new database in mongodb in the shell you need to give this command so you can

have created and why is that because until and unless you fill your database with some documents you will not see it here so if your database is empty it's not going to show you the database right so we need to fill our database with some data so in order to fill our database with some data we can give this command so we have already given this use my db command and we are inside this mydb database you can see switched to dbmydb so now we can give this command db which means we want to execute some command in my db because we are inside mydb database and then you need to give the name of the collection which you want to create inside your database i'm going to name my collection as books let's say right and then you need to write dot and then write insert and then in these parentheses you can give any key value appear in the form of json inside these parentheses so i'm going to just give my values in the form of json so let's say i want to just give the name of the book and that i can do by just giving this kind of json value so my mongodb book and then i'm going to add the semicolon here and then press enter and it says write result inserted 1 that means our document is inserted in this collection so now we can view the database when we give the show dbs command so when you press this upper arrow on your keyboard you will see all the previous commands so you can always give this show dbs command and you can see now it's visible right so mydb is visible here because we have one document inside our database now in order to view all the collections inside your database you give this command show collections and then semicolon and then press enter and it's going to show you all the collections inside your database we have created only one connection with the name books and that is shown here now in order to view the data or documents inside the collection you give this command so you need to write the database name or db because we are already using this uh database right by using use mydb command so db and then give the name of your collection in our case it's book and then just write find and then just add these parentheses semicolon press enter and it's going to show you all the documents inside your books collection and there is this one document which is present inside our collection mongodb automatically adds this id to every document so this is added by mongodb automatically and this is the data which you have provided so this is how you can use the shell in your command prompt right let me minimize this so we have also installed the compass right so if it's not open you can always click on this icon which is created on the desktop and it's going to open the compass here for the first time when it starts it's going to show you this kind of window so i'm going to click on all these next values and then i'm going to click on get started so i'm going to leave everything as default and then click on start

i need to click on connect and then new connection and it's going to open this new window for me otherwise you can already see that this window is already there now what it says here paste your connection string so if you know little bit about mongodb in order to connect to our database we need a connection string you can also know more about this connection string by clicking on this info icon here and it will redirect you to this uh web page where you can read more about this mongodb connection so what will be the connection string in our case so when you go to the shell once again and when you have given this command on your command prompt you will be able to see this connection string here so it's mongodb colon forward slash forward slash 127.0.0.1 which is our localhost this is the port at which mongodb has been started so our connection string will be this one but the essential part of the connection string is up to this port right so you need to give this connection string and after that these parameters are optional you can give them or you can just leave them so let's give this kind of connection string on your mongodb documentation also you will see the same documentation that you need to give the connection string in this format so if you are using some host name you can give the host name in the middle let's copy this and then i'm going to go to the compass and then paste this here and instead of this host name i need to give the local host here right which is 127.0.0.1 right so this is the connection string i'm going to click on connect which is going to connect to mongodb server and now you can see the connection is successful and on the left hand side you will be able to see on which host and port it's running and then you will be able to see all the databases right so this is the list of all the databases and this is the database which we have created which is called mydb right using the shell right now you can see it contains only one document so let's click on this and you can see this document is now visible here right so using this mongodb compass it's really easy to visualize your data inside your mongodb you can also perform aggregation queries you can also view the schema explain plan indexes and you can also do the validation using this mongodb compass very easily so this is how you can download and install mongodb on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
