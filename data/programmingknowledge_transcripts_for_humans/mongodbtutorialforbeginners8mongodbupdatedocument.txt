00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - mongodb database tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in this video we will see how we can
00:07 - update a document using mongodb so let's
00:11 - get started first of all we are going to
00:13 - uh switch to the same database as we
00:16 - have used in the last video which is
00:18 - school so just write School use school
00:22 - and execute it and now we are switched
00:25 - to school database now first of all
00:27 - let's let's uh list all the documents so
00:32 - we know what are the documents present
00:34 - so just write db. student which is a
00:36 - collection dot find and then give this
00:41 - brackets here and execute it and these
00:44 - are the documents we have now to update
00:48 - a document what we need to do is we will
00:51 - just write DB then the collection name
00:54 - and then there is a special method
00:58 - called update which we can use to update
01:01 - a document or multiple documents okay so
01:06 - just give this command and inside these
01:09 - round brackets what we can do is we can
01:12 - give first of all the condition on the
01:16 - basis of which we want to addit for
01:20 - example we want to addit uh the age or
01:25 - the surname of a student whose ID is
01:29 - this one for example right so in this
01:32 - condition our uh condition is this one
01:36 - which is ID is this and wherever the ID
01:41 - is equal to this ID then we are going to
01:44 - change the surname right so just give
01:48 - this curly brace and let's give two
01:51 - curly brace because uh we are going to
01:54 - use both of them and in the first uh
01:57 - curly brace you just need to give your
02:01 - condition for example ID is equal to
02:05 - this ID right so we will give this and
02:08 - in the second cly braces we will just
02:12 - give the value we want to set right but
02:16 - this takes a special parameter called
02:19 - dollar set so this will tell or this
02:23 - will tell the mongod DB to set this
02:26 - value right and then give colon and once
02:29 - again curly brace and then the value
02:33 - which we want to set so for example we
02:36 - want to set the surname here right so
02:40 - let's set this surname and instead of uh
02:44 - this surname we want some other surname
02:47 - for
02:49 - example some other surname right and
02:53 - then just execute this command just
02:55 - select all this command and execute it
02:58 - and you can see uh one modified okay and
03:02 - once again we can uh give
03:05 - db.
03:07 - students
03:10 - doind and uh this is not version but
03:15 - students and execute it and you can see
03:19 - the surname is changed here right so in
03:23 - this way you can uh change or update
03:26 - your uh document the second way to
03:30 - update a document for example you want
03:32 - to update multiple document based on
03:36 - some condition so how to do it so we
03:40 - will addit the same uh command or let's
03:44 - copy this command and paste it once
03:47 - again here and this time what we want to
03:51 - do is the student which have the age 16
03:56 - because we have uh two student which
03:58 - have the age 16 for example we want to
04:02 - uh change the surname of these two
04:04 - student whose uh age is 16 this and this
04:08 - one right so how we can do it so instead
04:12 - of this condition ID we can give the age
04:17 - condition now right so instead of this
04:20 - just write age is equal to 16 and then
04:24 - set and then the last name we want to
04:27 - set uh some uh surname right so some for
04:31 - example some
04:34 - surname and then once we execute this
04:38 - command let's see what happens so there
04:41 - are two uh data which must be affected
04:44 - by this so let's execute this and this
04:48 - time it says modified is equal to 1 but
04:52 - we were expecting the two uh you know
04:55 - values to be affected by our uh you know
04:58 - command and the reason for this is the
05:03 - update command when you uh you know
05:05 - execute it something like this is going
05:08 - to uh just update the first uh document
05:13 - which it finds satisfying this condition
05:16 - so let's first of all uh list our uh you
05:19 - know documents once again and let's see
05:22 - what happened so in here you can see one
05:26 - of the document which is the first
05:28 - document it's uh updated but the second
05:32 - document is not updated right now to
05:35 - update the multiple document we need to
05:38 - add one more condition here and this
05:43 - condition is the third condition and
05:46 - what is the condition the condition is
05:48 - just give the curly brace once again and
05:51 - then just
05:52 - write
05:54 - multi colon
05:56 - true and let's execute this command but
06:00 - I'm going to remove this and don't
06:02 - forget you need to give the comma here
06:05 - right and then once again uh execute
06:08 - this command and it says one more uh
06:11 - data is affected which is uh the other
06:15 - data right so just uh list out the
06:19 - documents once again and once again this
06:23 - other document is uh you know corrected
06:26 - or edited or updated right now once
06:30 - again we will uh try to update with this
06:33 - command and this time it should uh you
06:35 - know update the multiple data so let's
06:38 - uh update the surname on once again uh
06:42 - some weird surname and then once again
06:46 - execute
06:47 - it and it says modified two that means
06:51 - it modified two commands and let's uh
06:54 - list out our uh data once again and you
06:58 - can see at the two places it has
07:01 - modified uh the documents now there is
07:05 - one more command which can be used to
07:08 - update the data and this command is the
07:12 - save command so how it works so instead
07:16 - of uh using these commands what we do is
07:19 - we will just write db. student which is
07:22 - our collection name do save and in uh
07:27 - this save command what we can do is is
07:29 - we can give the whole Json which we want
07:33 - to update so this command do two things
07:37 - if the ID so for example we can we want
07:40 - to edit this data we can just copy the
07:44 - whole Jason and we can paste it here and
07:48 - for example we want to change the age
07:50 - here we can just uh change the age to
07:53 - for example 14 okay so what it does is
07:58 - it search for this ID inside your
08:02 - documents and if this ID is uh present
08:06 - then it's going to uh you know set the
08:08 - data or update the data for this ID
08:11 - document or otherwise if this ID is not
08:14 - found it's going to create a new uh
08:17 - document with the new ID and the new
08:21 - data right so let's execute this uh
08:25 - command and let's see what
08:27 - happens and it says one document
08:31 - modified and let's uh list out our uh
08:34 - documents once again and you can see the
08:38 - age is changed now let's uh change the
08:42 - ID little bit so for example instead of
08:47 - uh we have until 9 e so let's give
08:51 - 9f okay and the student name is uh Tom
08:57 - for example and some
09:00 - surname and the age is for example 16 or
09:05 - let's say 17 okay and let's remove this
09:08 - command and let's execute this
09:11 - command and you can see right result so
09:15 - once again we can uh list out all the
09:18 - documents and you can see a new data is
09:21 - added to your uh documents which is this
09:27 - one right so this Works in two ways one
09:30 - for inserting the data and other for
09:33 - updating the data so in this way you can
09:36 - update documents in mongod DB I hope

hello guys welcome to the next video on mongodb database tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can update a document using mongodb so let's get started first of all we are going to uh switch to the same database as we have used in the last video which is school so just write School use school and execute it and now we are switched to school database now first of all let's let's uh list all the documents so we know what are the documents present so just write db. student which is a collection dot find and then give this brackets here and execute it and these are the documents we have now to update a document what we need to do is we will just write DB then the collection name and then there is a special method called update which we can use to update a document or multiple documents okay so just give this command and inside these round brackets what we can do is we can give first of all the condition on the basis of which we want to addit for example we want to addit uh the age or the surname of a student whose ID is this one for example right so in this condition our uh condition is this one which is ID is this and wherever the ID is equal to this ID then we are going to change the surname right so just give this curly brace and let's give two curly brace because uh we are going to use both of them and in the first uh curly brace you just need to give your condition for example ID is equal to this ID right so we will give this and in the second cly braces we will just give the value we want to set right but this takes a special parameter called dollar set so this will tell or this will tell the mongod DB to set this value right and then give colon and once again curly brace and then the value which we want to set so for example we want to set the surname here right so let's set this surname and instead of uh this surname we want some other surname for example some other surname right and then just execute this command just select all this command and execute it and you can see uh one modified okay and once again we can uh give db. students doind and uh this is not version but students and execute it and you can see the surname is changed here right so in this way you can uh change or update your uh document the second way to update a document for example you want to update multiple document based on some condition so how to do it so we will addit the same uh command or let's copy this command and paste it once again here and this time what we want to do is the student which have the age 16 because we have uh two student which have the age 16 for example we want to uh change the surname of these two student whose uh age is 16 this and this one right so how we can do it so instead of this condition ID we can give the age condition now right so instead of this just write age is equal to 16 and then set and then the last name we want to set uh some uh surname right so some for example some surname and then once we execute this command let's see what happens so there are two uh data which must be affected by this so let's execute this and this time it says modified is equal to 1 but we were expecting the two uh you know values to be affected by our uh you know command and the reason for this is the update command when you uh you know execute it something like this is going to uh just update the first uh document which it finds satisfying this condition so let's first of all uh list our uh you know documents once again and let's see what happened so in here you can see one of the document which is the first document it's uh updated but the second document is not updated right now to update the multiple document we need to add one more condition here and this condition is the third condition and what is the condition the condition is just give the curly brace once again and then just write multi colon true and let's execute this command but I'm going to remove this and don't forget you need to give the comma here right and then once again uh execute this command and it says one more uh data is affected which is uh the other data right so just uh list out the documents once again and once again this other document is uh you know corrected or edited or updated right now once again we will uh try to update with this command and this time it should uh you know update the multiple data so let's uh update the surname on once again uh some weird surname and then once again execute it and it says modified two that means it modified two commands and let's uh list out our uh data once again and you can see at the two places it has modified uh the documents now there is one more command which can be used to update the data and this command is the save command so how it works so instead of uh using these commands what we do is we will just write db. student which is our collection name do save and in uh this save command what we can do is is we can give the whole Json which we want to update so this command do two things if the ID so for example we can we want to edit this data we can just copy the whole Jason and we can paste it here and for example we want to change the age here we can just uh change the age to for example 14 okay so what it does is it search for this ID inside your documents and if this ID is uh present then it's going to uh you know set the data or update the data for this ID document or otherwise if this ID is not found it's going to create a new uh document with the new ID and the new data right so let's execute this uh command and let's see what happens and it says one document modified and let's uh list out our uh documents once again and you can see the age is changed now let's uh change the ID little bit so for example instead of uh we have until 9 e so let's give 9f okay and the student name is uh Tom for example and some surname and the age is for example 16 or let's say 17 okay and let's remove this command and let's execute this command and you can see right result so once again we can uh list out all the documents and you can see a new data is added to your uh documents which is this one right so this Works in two ways one for inserting the data and other for updating the data so in this way you can update documents in mongod DB I hope you've enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
