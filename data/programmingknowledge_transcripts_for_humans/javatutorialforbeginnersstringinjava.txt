00:00 - okay so welcome back guys to another
00:02 - video of the Java tutorial Series so
00:04 - today we are learning strings in Java so
00:08 - in Java string is basically an object
00:10 - that represents the sequence of
00:11 - character values an array of the
00:14 - characters Works same as that of the
00:16 - Java string for for example we will see
00:19 - in the core part so generally string is
00:22 - in sequence of the characters but in
00:24 - Java string is an object that represents
00:27 - a sequence of the characters and it is
00:29 - present inside the java.lang dot string
00:32 - class is used to create a string of the
00:35 - object so you you could ask me how to
00:37 - create a string object so there are
00:40 - basically two two ways where we can
00:42 - create a object for a string so first
00:45 - way is using the string literal and the
00:48 - second way is using the new keyword okay
00:50 - so string literal is created by using
00:54 - the double quotes Okay so let me just
00:57 - give an idea here itself if I create a
01:00 - new text
01:01 - let me decrease some font size so you
01:04 - can see
01:05 - okay so if I create string s that is
01:10 - equals to let's say
01:13 - welcome okay
01:16 - and if I write this okay
01:19 - let me get it here okay
01:22 - and I will again write same text here
01:27 - that is
01:29 - string now I am changing the object name
01:32 - here okay like previously I write yes
01:34 - now I am writing S1 but here also here
01:38 - also I am giving the same string value
01:42 - okay that is welcome
01:46 - okay
01:47 - so here you can see yes I have created
01:51 - S1 I have created and okay and I will
01:54 - create another one
01:56 - let me create it first and I will name
01:59 - it as S2 now object name is S2 but the
02:03 - value
02:04 - here also I have given this same value
02:07 - okay I have created three object of the
02:11 - string ss1 and S2 and but the values
02:13 - which are assigned to those objects are
02:15 - same so inside Java what Java interprets
02:19 - it's as this hip memory is there and
02:23 - inside hip memory string constant pull
02:25 - is there and inside that all those
02:28 - strings which are constant are kept here
02:31 - and one stack is there which maintains
02:34 - an Al and it creates one link and it's
02:37 - assigned that value okay so here you can
02:39 - see I have created three object as S1
02:41 - and S2 and but this value is same and
02:43 - which are constant okay so that string
02:46 - is added inside the constant pull
02:47 - welcome is added and S1 and H2 which are
02:50 - having the same value is getting mapped
02:52 - with the with that value okay
02:55 - I hope you guys are getting so here it
02:57 - doesn't creates a new instance okay and
03:00 - this is this is where it makes the Java
03:04 - program more efficient because new
03:06 - objects are created if it is already
03:08 - exist in the constant Port okay
03:12 - so another way is by using the new
03:15 - keyword okay in such cases jvm will
03:17 - create a new string object in normal
03:19 - that is non pull hip memory and the
03:22 - lateral welcome will be placed in the
03:25 - string Constable pool the variable s
03:27 - will refer to the object in the hip and
03:30 - non-mem non-pull okay so what I mean I
03:34 - will show in inside the code section so
03:37 - Java class methods is there I will show
03:39 - you that later
03:41 - first I will let me show you
03:43 - how the string actually works in Java
03:46 - okay so let me create one class name
03:51 - not strings
03:59 - okay
04:00 - and let me increase the font size
04:05 - okay and inside this
04:08 - I will just
04:11 - get my main method
04:13 - Okay so
04:16 - as we have discussed the first first you
04:20 - know first definition I will write one
04:24 - array of characters then we'll name it
04:26 - as ch
04:28 - and I will assign
04:30 - value it like this let's suppose hello
04:35 - H is there
04:39 - h e
04:42 - again
04:44 - okay
04:47 - IntelliJ is showing me error because I
04:50 - have used those
04:52 - double braces
04:54 - okay let me remove this
04:57 - okay h e
05:02 - l
05:06 - oh sorry
05:08 - h l
05:11 - l n o okay so I have created one array
05:15 - of characters
05:16 - okay I know you guys don't know what is
05:19 - array we will be covering that part also
05:21 - in our upcoming videos
05:23 - so let me create one string
05:26 - okay string s
05:29 - which is equals to
05:31 - new string
05:33 - and I'll assign the way pass the value
05:36 - to it as CH okay and simply I will
05:41 - print s on the console and now if I
05:45 - click on run
05:48 - here you can see Hello is getting
05:50 - printed okay so first we have characters
05:52 - means single single characters are there
05:55 - like h e l l o and what string does it
05:59 - it can't get all those characters and
06:02 - form one word and store inside the uh
06:06 - object s okay so let's see another
06:13 - example let me just comment it out
06:17 - and I will show you another example
06:18 - where
06:20 - wait a minute I require this line for
06:23 - the another example I will just copy and
06:25 - paste it here
06:27 - okay and I will create another string
06:32 - that is S2
06:35 - news
06:39 - new string
06:44 - okay and I will create another string
06:49 - S3
06:51 - and I will assign it the value string
06:55 - but now I am giving the hard coded value
06:57 - that is let's suppose example okay
07:02 - example
07:04 - so now I'm trying to print that S2
07:11 - and I again I will print that object S3
07:15 - okay
07:16 - and if I
07:18 - click on run
07:20 - now what will happen see he see here
07:23 - hello is getting printed that is a it
07:25 - will concat all those characters all the
07:28 - strings character array and store it
07:30 - inside the object S2 and inside object
07:33 - S3 example is this string which is get
07:36 - stored inside it
07:38 - okay
07:39 - enough talking about the example so in
07:43 - Java there are multiple methods so here
07:46 - you can see a whole bunch of list is
07:48 - here of around 28 methods are there
07:51 - which are declared inside the string
07:54 - class in Java so I will give you one
07:58 - link where you can see the
08:00 - implementation of part of this all these
08:03 - methods I want you to try all playing
08:06 - with this all methods for but first of
08:10 - all let me show you some
08:12 - important ones okay I will show you some
08:15 - important one which are required in our
08:18 - Java code okay
08:20 - so let me just comment it out
08:24 - and here
08:26 - hmm okay so
08:29 - I'll be giving you the example of
08:33 - string
08:36 - two lower case
08:39 - there is Method inside the string class
08:41 - that's name two lowercase this method
08:44 - Returns the string in the lower case
08:46 - letters okay in another word it converts
08:49 - all this character of the string into
08:50 - the lower case
08:52 - okay let me give you an example so that
08:54 - you can understand
08:55 - better
08:56 - okay so if I create one string name S1
09:01 - I mean I will assign it
09:05 - value as let's suppose
09:10 - okay let me give you the straightforward
09:14 - method S1 is equals to
09:18 - let's suppose I have created h
09:21 - and let my caps lock hey hello
09:25 - well this there okay so here you can see
09:27 - I have created one S1 object and I have
09:29 - stored a string hello world inside it
09:32 - okay
09:33 - so if I try to print that string
09:38 - okay let me out okay so if I want to
09:42 - print this I will simply sound the S1
09:44 - okay that is Simpson dot out Dot println
09:47 - okay so again if I try to print
09:51 - S1 but I will do some modification okay
09:55 - so I will write S1 dot so you can see a
09:59 - whole bunch of methods which are
10:01 - implemented inside the Java are
10:03 - displayed here so we want two lowercase
10:05 - two lowercases here and you will simply
10:08 - put this and if now if I click on run
10:11 - let's see see you can here you can see
10:14 - hello world is the original thing where
10:16 - all the all the alphabets are in capital
10:19 - format okay and if I uh apply the two
10:22 - lowercase method over it string and then
10:26 - it will convert all those alphabets into
10:28 - the lowercase format and it will print
10:30 - to the con print on the console okay
10:33 - similarly all those methods which are
10:35 - implemented in inside the string class
10:37 - are over here you can go on that website
10:39 - and check it out similarly to lowercase
10:42 - is there and two uppercases there which
10:44 - will convert all those
10:46 - uh strings and alphabet into the
10:48 - uppercases format if if there are any
10:51 - in the in your string similarly trim is
10:54 - there index office there and one more we
10:56 - can use his care at and in length it
11:00 - Returns the string length this is also
11:03 - important method with which come into
11:05 - picture when we are using Java arrays
11:07 - okay we will discuss that and when we
11:10 - try to learn Java arrays okay so enough
11:14 - about enough talking about the strings I
11:16 - hope you get the idea about string what
11:19 - are the string in Java okay thank you
11:22 - for watching this video I will see you
11:23 - in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

okay so welcome back guys to another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we are learning strings in Java so in Java string is basically an object that represents the sequence of character values an array of the characters Works same as that of the Java string for for example we will see in the core part so generally string is in sequence of the characters but in Java string is an

created by using the double quotes Okay so let me just give an idea here itself if I create a new text let me decrease some font size so you can see okay so if I create string s that is equals to let's say welcome okay and if I write this okay let me get it here okay and I will again write same text here that is string now I am changing the object name here okay like previously I write yes now I am writing S1 but here also here also I am giving the same string value okay that is welcome okay so here you can see yes I have created S1 I have created and okay and I will create another one let me create it first and I will name it as S2 now object name is S2 but the value here also I have given this same value okay I have created three object of the string ss1 and S2 and but the values which are assigned to those objects are same so inside Java what Java interprets it's as this hip memory is there and inside hip memory string constant pull is there and inside that all those strings which are constant are kept here and one stack is there which maintains an Al and it creates one link and it's assigned that value okay so here you can see I have created three object as S1 and S2 and but this value is same and which are constant okay so that string is added inside the constant pull welcome is added and S1 and H2 which are having the same value is getting mapped with the with that value okay I hope you guys are getting so here it doesn't creates a new instance okay and this is this is where it makes the Java program more efficient because new objects are created if it is already exist in the constant Port okay so another way is by using the new keyword okay in such cases jvm will create a new string object in normal that is non pull hip memory and the lateral welcome will be placed in the string Constable pool the variable s will refer to the object in the hip and nonmem nonpull okay so what I mean I will show in inside the code section so Java class methods is there I will show you that later first I will let me show you how the string actually works in Java okay so let me create one class name not strings okay and let me increase the font size okay and inside this I will just get my main method Okay so as we have discussed the first first you know first definition I will write one array of characters then we'll name it as ch and I will assign value it like this let's suppose hello H is there h e again okay IntelliJ is showing me error because I have used those double braces okay let me remove this okay h e l oh sorry h l l n o okay so I have created one array of characters okay I know you guys don't know what is array we will be covering that part also in our upcoming videos so let me create one string okay string s which is equals to new string and I'll assign the way pass the value to it as CH okay and simply I will print s on the console and now if I click on run here you can see Hello is getting printed okay so first we have characters means single single characters are there like h e l l o and what string does it it can't get all those characters and form one word and store inside the uh object s okay so let's see another example let me just comment it out and I will show you another example where wait a minute I require this line for the another example I will just copy and paste it here okay and I will create another string that is S2 news new string okay and I will create another string S3 and I will assign it the value string but now I am giving the hard coded value that is let's suppose example okay example so now I'm trying to print that S2 and I again I will print that object S3 okay and if I click on run now what will happen see he see here hello is getting printed that is a it will concat all those characters all the strings character array and store it inside the object S2 and inside object S3 example is this string which is get stored inside it okay enough talking about the example so in Java there are multiple methods so here you can see a whole bunch of list is here of around 28 methods are there which are declared inside the string class in Java so I will give you one link where you can see the implementation of part of this all these methods I want you to try all playing with this all methods for but first of all let me show you some important ones okay I will show you some important one which are required in our Java code okay so let me just comment it out and here hmm okay so I'll be giving you the example of string two lower case there is Method inside the string class that's name two lowercase this method Returns the string in the lower case letters okay in another word it converts all this character of the string into the lower case okay let me give you an example so that you can understand better okay so if I create one string name S1 I mean I will assign it value as let's suppose okay let me give you the straightforward method S1 is equals to let's suppose I have created h and let my caps lock hey hello well this there okay so here you can see I have created one S1 object and I have stored a string hello world inside it okay so if I try to print that string okay let me out okay so if I want to print this I will simply sound the S1 okay that is Simpson dot out Dot println okay so again if I try to print S1 but I will do some modification okay so I will write S1 dot so you can see a whole bunch of methods which are implemented inside the Java are displayed here so we want two lowercase two lowercases here and you will simply put this and if now if I click on run let's see see you can here you can see hello world is the original thing where all the all the alphabets are in capital format okay and if I uh apply the two lowercase method over it string and then it will convert all those alphabets into the lowercase format and it will print to the con print on the console okay similarly all those methods which are implemented in inside the string class are over here you can go on that website and check it out similarly to lowercase is there and two uppercases there which will convert all those uh strings and alphabet into the uppercases format if if there are any in the in your string similarly trim is there index office there and one more we can use his care at and in length it Returns the string length this is also important method with which come into picture when we are using Java arrays okay we will discuss that and when we try to learn Java arrays okay so enough about enough talking about the strings I hope you get the idea about string what are the string in Java okay thank you for watching this video I will see you in the next one
