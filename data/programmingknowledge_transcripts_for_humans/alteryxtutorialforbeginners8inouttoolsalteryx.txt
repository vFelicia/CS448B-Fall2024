With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video we are going to take a
00:01 - look at the few tools of this in out
00:04 - configuration
00:06 - so the first tool that we are going to
00:08 - look at is the directory tool
00:10 - so the directory tool is used to return
00:13 - a list of all the files that are present
00:15 - in the specified directory
00:17 - it returns the file name and other
00:19 - information about each file uh like its
00:22 - size the date it was created the last
00:24 - modified date and many more information
00:26 - okay so let's see how do we use it first
00:30 - of all grab the directory tool
00:32 - from the you know tab into your workflow
00:34 - workspace then what you need to do is in
00:37 - this configuration tab you have to
00:39 - specify the directory of the folder from
00:41 - where you want to get the files okay so
00:43 - in my case i have already specified the
00:44 - folder that is this files folder in the
00:47 - altrix
00:48 - click on ok
00:50 - now if you want specific files to be
00:52 - there only then you can specify the
00:54 - files
00:55 - otherwise uh this asterix is over here
00:58 - that means uh any of the files any of
01:01 - the file names dot any of the file
01:03 - extensions would be taken
01:05 - if you want to um
01:07 - include the sub directories like if you
01:09 - want to search for the specified file
01:11 - types in directories
01:12 - that are specified within the specified
01:14 - directory then this box um
01:17 - is checked otherwise leave it unchecked
01:19 - okay
01:20 - it's only for the specific files but we
01:22 - are going for the generic ones so no
01:24 - need to include the sub directories
01:26 - let's just click on run
01:27 - so what would happen is uh you would get
01:30 - this kind of an output that is the list
01:33 - of all of these uh
01:35 - files that are present in this directory
01:37 - the full path the directory the name of
01:40 - the file along with its extension
01:43 - the
01:44 - creation time the time when it was last
01:47 - accessed last written
01:49 - the size
01:51 - and some of the attributes like it is it
01:54 - encrypted is it compressed is it
01:56 - archived is it hidden is it normal
01:59 - uh is it
02:00 - offline is it read-only
02:02 - uh and so on so these are all the fields
02:06 - that we would be getting so this is for
02:07 - the generic files let us now search for
02:09 - the specific files
02:11 - okay so we are going with the extension
02:13 - as you can see yxmd files are present
02:15 - over here so instead of
02:18 - all the files
02:19 - my
02:20 - xmd files are the only ones that i am
02:22 - interested in right now and in the sub
02:24 - directories as well
02:26 - then click on run
02:28 - so what i would be getting is
02:31 - only the yxmd file so there are a total
02:33 - of seven yx md files in the sub
02:35 - directories and the directory of this
02:37 - particular folder so this is what i am
02:39 - getting through the directory tool
02:42 - right
02:43 - let's just click ctrl s to save it
02:46 - next tool that we have is the date time
02:48 - tool so as we have discussed about the
02:51 - date time already uh in the data types
02:55 - video in alteryx so this daytime now
02:59 - tool is used to return a single record
03:01 - that is the date or the time at the time
03:04 - when the workflow was run
03:06 - and you can just convert the value into
03:09 - the string format of your choosing so
03:11 - basically this is useful that once you
03:14 - are creating any report and you want to
03:17 - show the date or the time of its
03:18 - creation
03:19 - then you can use this particular tool
03:21 - okay so let's just bring in this tool
03:24 - this is the daytime now tool
03:26 - over here it
03:27 - requires us to specify two things the
03:29 - language in which we want the date and
03:31 - time and the format in which we want
03:32 - that is the output format so let's just
03:35 - get the
03:37 - format like this where i'm getting the
03:39 - date as well as the time
03:41 - now click on run or use the shortcut
03:43 - ctrl r so we would be getting
03:45 - a column with today's date and the time
03:48 - at which this was run okay
03:51 - now in case you decide to change the
03:53 - language right now i have taken english
03:54 - but let me just
03:56 - go with spanish okay
03:58 - click on ok
03:59 - and now what we are getting is the same
04:02 - output but to get a different output
04:04 - let's just choose a different format
04:06 - like this
04:08 - click on run
04:09 - and now what we are getting is a
04:11 - different format like the month name is
04:12 - in spanish right now
04:14 - so this is what we are getting
04:16 - this is the usage of the um date time
04:19 - now tool
04:21 - let's just press ctrl s to save it
04:23 - and move on to the next tool which is
04:25 - the text input tool now what is the
04:28 - usage of this text input tool
04:30 - uh it is used to manually enter the text
04:33 - to create small data files for input
04:36 - it can be useful in
04:38 - like testing and creating the lookup
04:40 - tables while we are building the
04:42 - workflow
04:43 - the data input from the text input tool
04:46 - saves within the workflow so you can
04:47 - share the workflow without having to
04:49 - provide an input file okay
04:52 - so let's see how do we work with it
04:54 - first of all let's just get this input
04:55 - data that is this text input tool
04:58 - over here now once we have got it over
05:01 - here we would be getting these different
05:02 - options like this is the option to
05:04 - import if you want to import any of the
05:06 - files but treat it as the input that has
05:09 - been manually taken into the workflow so
05:11 - when we share the workflow the file gets
05:13 - shared as well we do not have to
05:15 - externally share the file
05:17 - right then we have the copy once we have
05:19 - entered the values if you want to copy
05:20 - it if you have already copied the values
05:22 - from somewhere and just want to paste it
05:24 - over here that's
05:25 - this paste option you can use the delete
05:28 - and the insert options are there as well
05:30 - so delete is to delete any of the data
05:32 - that's existing and insert to insert the
05:33 - columns so let's just insert a
05:36 - row first of all
05:37 - so this is the row that's been inserted
05:39 - if you just double click over here you
05:40 - can start adding the values so what i'm
05:43 - going to add is name
05:45 - let's say samir
05:47 - then i'm going to add a value
05:49 - let's say 12 and then i'm going to add a
05:52 - city let's say delhi okay so this is my
05:54 - first value that i have entered read
05:57 - similarly i can add another value let's
05:59 - say
06:02 - a name
06:03 - a value
06:05 - and a city
06:06 - so mumbai okay
06:08 - so this is how i can keep on adding the
06:11 - records manually
06:13 - uh these are the field names right now
06:15 - taken as field one field two and field
06:17 - three but if you want you can change
06:19 - them as well by double clicking on them
06:21 - so the first field name is going to be
06:23 - name
06:24 - the second one is going to be age and
06:26 - the third one is going to be
06:29 - city okay so this is the record that i
06:31 - have got if i just click on run then
06:34 - what would be i getting is
06:35 - this a whole record in the form of a
06:38 - table like this
06:39 - now let's just see how the import
06:41 - function works so let's just click on
06:42 - import this is the sheet excel sheet
06:45 - that i want to import this is the one
06:47 - that we just exported
06:49 - uh in the form of an excel file so the
06:51 - consumer one is what i'm going to import
06:54 - so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this
06:56 - tool so that's where the whole sheet was
06:58 - not imported but i'm happy with it
07:00 - let's just click on run
07:02 - now once we do that
07:04 - this whole table is actually a part
07:08 - of this
07:10 - tool this input
07:12 - tool okay a text input tool now this
07:15 - means there is no external file being
07:17 - associated with this if you just delete
07:19 - the excel file then also there would be
07:21 - no change in altrix because altrix has
07:23 - created a copy using the text input tool
07:26 - of this particular data set right so
07:28 - this is uh the importance of the text
07:31 - input tool over the normal input data
07:34 - tool that we were using up till now
07:36 - but there is an added disadvantage as
07:38 - well because uh in this case alteryx
07:40 - create another memory of itself to store
07:43 - this data so there would be an
07:45 - additional memory requirement so it
07:46 - depends upon you and the requirement of
07:49 - the
07:50 - particular workflow that whether you
07:52 - want to use the text input tool or the
07:54 - input data tool okay
07:57 - now let's uh save it
07:59 - yeah in case you want to delete it
08:01 - suppose i just don't want this order id
08:02 - column so delete the columns so you can
08:05 - just select the column
08:07 - and delete it
08:08 - if you want to select uh delete a
08:10 - particular row like i want to delete
08:12 - this row number six delete row so the
08:15 - row number six has been deleted okay so
08:17 - this is how the things work in the text
08:19 - input tool you can actually make changes
08:21 - into the data set as well without
08:23 - affecting the original excel file uh you
08:27 - can copy it and if i just open up my
08:29 - notepad
08:32 - i would be able to paste it as well
08:34 - like six was selected so this has been
08:36 - copied you want to select multiple
08:38 - records like this
08:41 - and copy them
08:42 - then go to notepad
08:45 - and paste them so you would be able to
08:47 - create a copy for them for yourself as
08:49 - well okay
08:51 - let's just remove it right now
08:53 - so that's about the text input tool that
08:54 - you need to know now let us talk about
08:56 - the map input tool which is uh the final
08:59 - tool in this particular group so what is
09:02 - the map input tool as you can see the
09:04 - name itself is suggesting
09:08 - it is used to draw or select the desired
09:10 - map object to use as an input in a
09:12 - workflow
09:13 - you can either draw or select a point
09:16 - line or polygon to form a map that
09:17 - displays a reference base map okay
09:20 - so let's just get this tool map input
09:22 - tool over here and as soon as we get
09:24 - there uh there would be a map
09:27 - you can just select the base map right
09:29 - now it's selected to none
09:31 - let's just select alternate stark so
09:33 - you'd be getting a map you can hover
09:34 - over it
09:35 - to just you know
09:36 - load any of the countries or the
09:38 - continents that you like so i'm just
09:40 - going to go all the way to india
09:43 - using the zoom buttons you can zoom in
09:45 - or zoom out
09:47 - and get a location let's say kanpur
09:51 - and here i want to point to kanpur so uh
09:54 - right now as you can see the mode has
09:55 - been set to draw so i can draw anything
09:58 - so we can just get a point to draw it on
10:00 - kanpur over here
10:02 - and if you want to provide it a name so
10:05 - let me just provide it a name as home
10:07 - click on save
10:08 - and that's it you can click on run to
10:11 - run the workflow so what will it do is
10:13 - it will create
10:14 - this kind of a value for you the label
10:16 - is home and the spatial object is point
10:19 - view browse tool map tab
10:21 - so the spatial object has been created
10:23 - using the map input tool that's all for
10:26 - this video that's all about the in out
10:28 - tools that you need to know in altrix
10:29 - thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to take a look at the few tools of this in out configuration so the first tool that we are going to look at is the directory tool so the directory tool is used to return a list of all the files that are present in the specified directory it returns the file name and other information about each file uh like its size the date it was created the last modified date and many more information okay so let's see how do we use it first of all grab the directory tool from the you know tab into your workflow workspace then what you need to do is in this configuration tab you have to specify the directory of the folder from where you want to get the files okay so in my case i have already specified the folder that is this files folder in the altrix click on ok now if you want specific files to be there only then you can specify the files otherwise uh this asterix is over here that means uh any of the files any of the file names dot any of the file extensions would be taken if you want to um include the sub directories like if you want to search for the specified file types in directories that are specified within the specified directory then this box um is checked otherwise leave it unchecked okay it's only for the specific files but we are going for the generic ones so no need to include the sub directories let's just click on run so what would happen is uh you would get this kind of an output that is the list of all of these uh files that are present in this directory the full path the directory the name of the file along with its extension the creation time the time when it was last accessed last written the size and some of the attributes like it is it encrypted is it compressed is it archived is it hidden is it normal uh is it offline is it readonly uh and so on so these are all the fields that we would be getting so this is for the generic files let us now search for the specific files okay so we are going with the extension as you can see yxmd files are present over here so instead of all the files my xmd files are the only ones that i am interested in right now and in the sub directories as well then click on run so what i would be getting is only the yxmd file so there are a total of seven yx md files in the sub directories and the directory of this particular folder so this is what i am getting through the directory tool right let's just click ctrl s to save it next tool that we have is the date time tool so as we have discussed about the date time already uh in the data types video in alteryx so this daytime now tool is used to return a single record that is the date or the time at the time when the workflow was run and you can just convert the value into the string format of your choosing so basically this is useful that once you are creating any report and you want to show the date or the time of its creation then you can use this particular tool okay so let's just bring in this tool this is the daytime now tool over here it requires us to specify two things the language in which we want the date and time and the format in which we want that is the output format so let's just get the format like this where i'm getting the date as well as the time now click on run or use the shortcut ctrl r so we would be getting a column with today's date and the time at which this was run okay now in case you decide to change the language right now i have taken english but let me just go with spanish okay click on ok and now what we are getting is the same output but to get a different output let's just choose a different format like this click on run and now what we are getting is a different format like the month name is in spanish right now so this is what we are getting this is the usage of the um date time now tool let's just press ctrl s to save it and move on to the next tool which is the text input tool now what is the usage of this text input tool uh it is used to manually enter the text to create small data files for input it can be useful in like testing and creating the lookup tables while we are building the workflow the data input from the text input tool saves within the workflow so you can share the workflow without having to provide an input file okay so let's see how do we work with it first of all let's just get this input data that is this text input tool over here now once we have got it over here we would be getting these different options like this is the option to import if you want to import any of the files but treat it as the input that has been manually taken into the workflow so when we share the workflow the file gets shared as well we do not have to externally share the file right then we have the copy once we have entered the values if you want to copy it if you have already copied the values from somewhere and just want to paste it over here that's this paste option you can use the delete and the insert options are there as well so delete is to delete any of the data that's existing and insert to insert the columns so let's just insert a row first of all so this is the row that's been inserted if you just double click over here you can start adding the values so what i'm going to add is name let's say samir then i'm going to add a value let's say 12 and then i'm going to add a city let's say delhi okay so this is my first value that i have entered read similarly i can add another value let's say a name a value and a city so mumbai okay so this is how i can keep on adding the records manually uh these are the field names right now taken as field one field two and field three but if you want you can change them as well by double clicking on them so the first field name is going to be name the second one is going to be age and the third one is going to be city okay so this is the record that i have got if i just click on run then what would be i getting is this a whole record in the form of a table like this now let's just see how the import function works so let's just click on import this is the sheet excel sheet that i want to import this is the one that we just exported uh in the form of an excel file so the consumer one is what i'm going to import so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this tool so that's where the whole sheet was not imported but i'm happy with it let's just click on run now once we do that this whole table is actually a part of this tool this input tool okay a text input tool now this means there is no external file being associated with this if you just delete the excel file then also there would be no change in altrix because altrix has created a copy using the text input tool of this particular data set right so this is uh the importance of the text input tool over the normal input data tool that we were using up till now but there is an added disadvantage as well because uh in this case alteryx create another memory of itself to store this data so there would be an additional memory requirement so it depends upon you and the requirement of the particular workflow that whether you want to use the text input tool or the input data tool okay now let's uh save it yeah in case you want to delete it suppose i just don't want this order id column so delete the columns so you can just select the column and delete it if you want to select uh delete a particular row like i want to delete this row number six delete row so the row number six has been deleted okay so this is how the things work in the text input tool you can actually make changes into the data set as well without affecting the original excel file uh you can copy it and if i just open up my notepad i would be able to paste it as well like six was selected so this has been copied you want to select multiple records like this and copy them then go to notepad and paste them so you would be able to create a copy for them for yourself as well okay let's just remove it right now so that's about the text input tool that you need to know now let us talk about the map input tool which is uh the final tool in this particular group so what is the map input tool as you can see the name itself is suggesting it is used to draw or select the desired map object to use as an input in a workflow you can either draw or select a point line or polygon to form a map that displays a reference

select alternate stark so you'd be getting a map you can hover over it to just you know load any of the countries or the continents that you like so i'm just going to go all the way to india using the zoom buttons you can zoom in or zoom out and get a location let's say kanpur and here i want to point to kanpur so uh right now as you can see the mode has been set to draw so i can draw anything so we can just get a point to draw it on kanpur over here and if you want to provide it a name so let me just provide it a name as home click on save and that's it you can click on run to run the workflow so what will it do is it will create this kind of a value for you the label is home and the spatial object is point view browse tool map tab so the spatial object has been created using the map input tool that's all for this video that's all about the in out tools that you need to know in altrix thanks for watching
