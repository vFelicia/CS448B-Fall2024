00:00 - through programming knowledge hope
00:01 - you're all doing good so like with
00:03 - another tutorial in which we are going
00:05 - to today look at the speech recognition
00:06 - using Google speech recognition so let's
00:11 - get started with writing down the code
00:13 - for identifying the voice and converting
00:17 - it into text using Google speech
00:18 - recognition so before writing down the
00:22 - code I would suggest you to install the
00:24 - PI audio and PI speech libraries is at
00:28 - the PyCharm and along with that you need
00:30 - to have the speech recognition module
00:32 - for implementing this program and like
00:35 - for using the voice into text so let's
00:41 - go ahead and start adding the program as
00:42 - first I am going to import speech the
00:46 - condition and provide it as SR so as I
00:50 - have available availability of Spisak
00:53 - admission so I am going to import the
00:55 - speech recognition as yes are the next
00:57 - step what we are going to do is we are
00:59 - going to use the variable called R and
01:02 - inside that we are going to use a sword
01:05 - or recognizer by using recognizer and
01:15 - inside these here we go we have used the
01:21 - a sword recognizer and inside this we
01:25 - are going to use the width a sword or
01:31 - microphone the source here we go we have
01:40 - used s or not microphone and souls and I
01:45 - am going to use the print statement and
01:47 - provide us say something and lastly I am
01:58 - going to use another thing called audio
02:03 - as well and inside this I am going to
02:08 - use our dot listen
02:11 - and use the souls pass on the source
02:17 - okay so we have paws on the source now
02:24 - speech recognition using Google speech
02:28 - recognition and inside that's this Fri
02:30 - we are going for testing purposes we are
02:32 - going to use the exceptions which have
02:35 - already written down you can view it so
02:38 - inside the try statement first use the
02:41 - print and as printed as you said once we
02:46 - are going to like once we are going to
02:49 - record let's say like hello world as it
02:51 - will be displaying as you said hello
02:54 - world and the commonly used but all or
02:59 - recognized under school Google off and
03:02 - inside the packets you are going to pass
03:04 - on the audio which we have created
03:07 - inside that we have already seen and
03:09 - source and inside the exceptions we have
03:15 - used the speech recognition which we
03:17 - imported which we have imported and by
03:22 - using dot unknown value it will be
03:25 - displaying as Google speech recognition
03:27 - could not understand audio if we are not
03:31 - agree if we are not able to because the
03:34 - audio properly or the yeah so and
03:38 - another request exception we have
03:40 - created is by using the s already speech
03:43 - in admission and by using tort requests
03:45 - are as e coding as a as a part and
03:49 - inside that we use could not request
03:52 - results from Google speech recognition
03:54 - surveys and by using the value and by
03:58 - using dot format of e which we have
04:02 - defined it over here as e so we are
04:05 - going to pause the a inside the format
04:07 - of e so by using the simple lines of
04:11 - code we can be easily able to use the
04:14 - Google speech recognition and yeah so we
04:18 - can record and convert that into text
04:22 - so now let's go ahead and run the
04:23 - program and see the expected output
04:26 - which is it will be asking for say
04:29 - something and followed by beer it will
04:32 - be recording the audio by listening to
04:34 - our voice whatever we are saying and
04:38 - lastly it will be displaying into the
04:41 - text format by using the use 8 as a
04:43 - keyword now let's go ahead and run the
04:46 - program so we are going to run the
04:51 - program now here we go it's asking for
04:54 - say something hello world okay so yeah
05:03 - as I said before we tried like I said if
05:08 - we were is asking for something let's go
05:10 - and then run again run another program
05:16 - hello world hello world
05:29 - oops so as you can see we have not the
05:34 - Google is not understanding the
05:36 - recognition service now I'm going to
05:40 - refresh this program let's no no again
05:48 - I'm going to run this program okay
05:55 - hello world here we go as expected we
06:03 - use the hello world and it is displaying
06:08 - as hello world in the earlier by
06:11 - learning the program in the near part I
06:13 - was trying to tell you that it's asking
06:17 - for say something
06:19 - so it was predicting as we were say
06:21 - something so it was taking down my voice
06:23 - when I said that so now when I run the
06:26 - program again and I see it as hello
06:29 - world so it's playing as hello world and
06:30 - if it does not recognize your voice so
06:34 - it will it will take down the other
06:36 - values in which I'd like to tell you
06:44 - that so Google speech recognition could
06:47 - not understand audio and followed by
06:49 - could not regress results from Google
06:51 - speech recognition service okay so try
06:57 - this code and run this program for your
07:01 - purpose where you want to record the
07:03 - audio and display it into ten text
07:06 - format so hope you like this program and
07:10 - try running the program so that's it for
07:13 - today in the coming two days we'll be
07:15 - coming with exciting stuff thank you for
07:18 - joining with programming or I see you
07:19 - next door yes bye guys
