00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - mongodb database tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will see how we can
00:06 - delete a document or remove a document
00:10 - using
00:11 - mongodb so let's get started first of
00:13 - all we will uh just uh print all the
00:16 - documents we have so I will just write
00:19 - db. student. find and execute it and
00:23 - it's showing all the documents we have
00:26 - now to remove a document we need a
00:29 - command once again DB do student dot you
00:34 - guessed it right remove okay and remove
00:39 - uh function or this method takes uh few
00:43 - arguments which we can provide so we
00:45 - will see uh one by one how we can uh use
00:49 - this remove command so the basic command
00:52 - remove if you execute this command
00:56 - without any argument then it's going to
00:59 - remove all the documents okay so just uh
01:04 - you know handle this command with care
01:07 - otherwise it's going to remove all your
01:10 - documents if you don't pass any
01:12 - arguments here otherwise when you pass
01:15 - some arguments so first of all I will
01:17 - give these curly braces and inside these
01:21 - curly brackets what we can do is we can
01:24 - give some condition so the condition can
01:28 - be for example uh
01:30 - first of all which document we want to
01:33 - remove so we can remove a document based
01:37 - upon a unique identifier and in here uh
01:41 - we have this unique identifier called ID
01:44 - which is created by mongodb for us right
01:48 - so we can use this one Let's uh use this
01:52 - ID let's remove the last document which
01:55 - we have inserted which is this one and
01:58 - just paste it in here
02:01 - okay and I'm going to just uh execute
02:04 - this
02:05 - command and it says removed one right so
02:10 - I'm going to once again uh find uh all
02:14 - the documents so we can see if it's
02:16 - removed or not and you can see uh our
02:19 - document is removed from here right
02:22 - because there is no uh ID which is
02:26 - something like this 9f at the end right
02:30 - so this is one way of uh removing the
02:33 - document the other way of uh removing
02:36 - the document for example on the basis of
02:40 - uh a parameter which can affect multiple
02:44 - uh document so for example we want to
02:47 - remove the document of a student whose
02:52 - age is 16 and we can see here there are
02:56 - two student uh whose age is 16 here
03:00 - right so we can uh just give this
03:03 - parameter age is equal to 16 and then
03:08 - it's going to remove both these
03:11 - documents
03:13 - right but uh first of all uh if you
03:17 - don't want to remove both the document
03:19 - if you want to remove only one document
03:22 - then there is a parameter which is
03:25 - something like this if you provide uh
03:29 - number number one after these curly
03:32 - braces so just give comma and then give
03:35 - a number one something like this okay
03:39 - and this will tell mongod DB that we
03:42 - just want to uh Delete only one document
03:47 - even this condition is matching multiple
03:50 - uh you know documents but we just want
03:53 - to delete one so just write uh after
03:56 - this curly bracket comma and one and
03:59 - it's going to remove only one document
04:03 - okay otherwise if you don't give uh this
04:07 - comma one here is going to remove these
04:10 - both the documents so let's give this
04:13 - command first and let's see what happens
04:17 - and it says uh removed two documents and
04:22 - then we can print this documents and you
04:25 - can see all these documents which has
04:29 - age 16 is removed or are removed
04:34 - okay so if you want to remove only one
04:38 - document just give comma one otherwise
04:41 - you can uh you know remove on the basis
04:44 - of some condition like this okay so I
04:48 - hope you you have enjoyed this video
04:49 - please writ comment subscribe and bye
04:51 - for now
