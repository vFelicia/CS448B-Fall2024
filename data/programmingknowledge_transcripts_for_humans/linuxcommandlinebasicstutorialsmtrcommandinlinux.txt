With timestamps:

00:00 - now in this particular video we are
00:01 - going to learn about one of the most
00:03 - important command that is the MTR
00:04 - command okay
00:05 - so basically uh MTR command is nothing
00:08 - but like combination of the two commas
00:10 - which we have learned in our previous
00:12 - videos that is the Ping and the trace
00:13 - root command so now in this video we are
00:16 - going to learn about this and we will
00:19 - use like see the both the features of
00:22 - the pink command and the trace root
00:23 - command in this particular single
00:24 - command okay
00:25 - so let's start with the
00:28 - basic
00:29 - like what we have to write that is MTR
00:33 - and enter the then host name I will just
00:35 - go with the google.com and hit enter
00:38 - okay so here we you can see like uh this
00:42 - is refreshing again and again and again
00:43 - okay so basically what's happening here
00:46 - you can see the uh you will get the
00:48 - percentage loss and all the what are the
00:51 - number of packets and whatever has
00:53 - received average based and all these
00:55 - things okay
00:56 - so basically What's Happening Here you
00:58 - here you can see the number of hops like
01:01 - from our
01:02 - what you could say from our source to
01:04 - the destination okay so there are approx
01:07 - 10 hops here in this case
01:10 - so uh like basically with this command
01:12 - you are getting the overall uh what you
01:14 - can say overall statistics and what
01:16 - happens in this particular command as
01:18 - you can see this page is refreshing
01:20 - again and again and again so we started
01:22 - from zero and now we are still at here
01:24 - you can see we are at 48 again 49.50 so
01:27 - what is this happening this is basically
01:29 - nothing but uh
01:30 - the Ping request okay so here uh this
01:33 - command like what it does it sends pin
01:36 - request again and again and again
01:39 - so uh with pink Rick is what we send we
01:42 - send the which protocol we use icmp like
01:44 - internet control message protocol we use
01:46 - okay
01:48 - so uh here you can see that again I will
01:51 - like uh run this command to stop this we
01:55 - have to just hit Q
01:57 - and it will stop
01:59 - okay again let me check with the for
02:02 - another domain uh let's try for
02:05 - gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try for
02:09 - facebook.com
02:12 - so here you can see here also we are
02:14 - getting a 10 hops
02:16 - so there is no any packet loss here in
02:19 - this case
02:20 - okay so this is the again at 11 times
02:24 - that is 13 14 15 16 all these things you
02:27 - can see so to control the your what you
02:30 - can say ping request time like suppose
02:32 - you want to Ping again after some some
02:36 - after some seconds like suppose you want
02:38 - to Ping after two seconds so how you can
02:40 - do it so for this we use a special
02:42 - function not function we will say just
02:44 - it is uh just an option that is a hyphen
02:47 - I option okay so let's uh use that MTR
02:50 - hyphen I
02:54 - and we will specify the time for 2
02:57 - seconds
02:58 - and
03:00 - for domain name let's go with the
03:03 - YouTube
03:06 - okay so here you can see now it's not
03:09 - like earlier like it's sending the Ping
03:11 - request after two seconds so you can see
03:15 - the like change in the frequency of
03:17 - sending packets okay so here you can see
03:20 - F4 now seven now eight so it's slow
03:23 - slower than earlier okay
03:25 - so in this way you can control the ping
03:29 - request
03:30 - and here you can see the IP addresses of
03:32 - all the hopes which are which lies
03:34 - between our from the source and
03:36 - destination
03:37 - okay so and now moving forward uh
03:41 - suppose if you want to uh display only
03:44 - the what you can say
03:46 - only iPad is not host names like
03:48 - actually we are getting here uh IPL but
03:51 - still there is option of hyphen and so
03:53 - we will use it let me clear the screen
03:56 - MTR hyphen n and uh
03:59 - let's take some basic one uh our Indian
04:03 - website
04:04 - let me search
04:10 - not brave let me open Chrome
04:19 - okay I will search for
04:22 - let's search for blockchain
04:25 - so here okay here is the one website
04:27 - Investopedia okay
04:30 - or here is also blockchain.com is also
04:32 - one kind of website let's let me check
04:34 - it as I've
04:36 - yeah it's live okay we can
04:40 - find the IP and all what are the
04:44 - hops present between this
04:46 - so let me
04:49 - go like this first blockchain.com
04:51 - okay accessible
04:53 - one zero four okay
04:57 - okay
04:58 - now what I will do I will use the
05:02 - hyphen n option
05:05 - blockchain.com
05:08 - so here you can see only iPad is as
05:10 - earlier also we were getting only IP
05:12 - address but so what happens in some
05:14 - cases we get the host names okay
05:17 - we get the host names in place of these
05:20 - IP addresses okay so these are basically
05:22 - your ipv4 added whatever your 32-bit
05:24 - addresses okay
05:25 - how we will learn about more about in
05:27 - networking part okay about ipv4 address
05:31 - and IPv6 address okay so moving forward
05:34 - in this video so we will go with uh one
05:37 - of the like uh option with in which we
05:41 - store the output in different different
05:43 - files like the different formats you can
05:46 - say like we can store in XML we can
05:48 - store ingestion and also we can store in
05:51 - uh like other videos
05:54 - file format we can say I'm not getting
05:58 - what are the file formats let me check
06:00 - with uh
06:03 - okay so now here we will see
06:06 - uh what are the file formats uh
06:12 - um
06:13 - hyphen B naught
06:15 - this one local environment packet
06:23 - okay CSV is also there
06:29 - okay
06:31 - here we can see if yeah here you can see
06:34 - iPhone iPhone XML is there we can use
06:35 - hyphen iPhone XML for storing the output
06:38 - in
06:39 - like this okay
06:42 - so let me try with this hyphen hyphen
06:45 - XML google.com whether I will need to
06:49 - provide path or not I don't know
06:55 - okay
06:58 - Ctrl C to stop take one minute
07:01 - I will create One Directory
07:04 - uh
07:07 - 3D Block Chain
07:11 - and NTR iPhone iPhone XML
07:16 - google.com
07:19 - and now it will be sending like it's not
07:21 - displaying us here I will just hit Ctrl
07:23 - CLS okay no files has been created
07:26 - uh
07:28 - my front wall
07:31 - street.xml whether it's lock or not
07:35 - okay it's not working
07:38 - let me check
07:42 - okay uh let's try with CSV
07:50 - okay it's not printing anything
07:53 - I don't know what's the problem here uh
07:58 - basically what happens it displays the
08:00 - output in that particular format like if
08:03 - a head is CS with then comma separated
08:05 - values okay yeah okay we got it now so
08:08 - here you can see uh like this is the
08:10 - comma separated output in this case and
08:13 - if I will try with the XML uh
08:16 - actually uh file is not created the
08:19 - output is displayed in that particular
08:21 - format okay let's wait for our two to
08:24 - three seconds I hope it will work
08:30 - let's wait
08:37 - okay so here you can see uh the output
08:40 - in the XML format
08:42 - nice
08:44 - okay so moving forward uh what I will do
08:47 - uh I will use some other function uh not
08:50 - function I will use some other uh
08:53 - options in which we can like uh create a
08:56 - one file in which you will add some
08:58 - domain names and then we will call that
09:00 - file and use this particular command
09:02 - what I'm just trying to say you let me
09:05 - create one file so just remember how you
09:08 - can create file in Linux we will just
09:11 - use Touch command
09:14 - okay I will enter
09:18 - domain
09:19 - Dot txt and I will write first
09:22 - google.com
09:25 - facebook.com
09:29 - instagram.com okay that's enough Ctrl D
09:32 - to save
09:33 - okay let me check the content of this
09:35 - file not 50 what was the name domain
09:38 - yeah okay here is the domain uh now I
09:41 - will use MTR I will use hyphen f capital
09:44 - F option
09:45 - and provide the
09:49 - uh
09:53 - domain.txt
09:56 - and then the
09:58 - just it I think that's it
10:03 - okay
10:04 - so here you can see we are getting
10:05 - result for google.com
10:13 - okay
10:19 - so you can see the Ping request
10:21 - everything we can see here
10:23 - all statistics
10:28 - okay now further we will see how we can
10:30 - set the Ping okay so like uh normally
10:34 - what happens it sends approx 10 things
10:37 - request okay
10:39 - like one to ten
10:41 - okay if we want for only five how we can
10:45 - do MTR
10:47 - iPhone C5
10:49 - google.com
10:53 - this is third fourth and the last one is
10:55 - fifth that's it
10:57 - so only five packets have been sent okay
11:01 - okay uh yeah again so here you can see
11:05 - this is a percentage loss here we can
11:07 - see the maximum percentage loss we don't
11:10 - know why and sent
11:14 - okay wait a minute
11:16 - I have to just to explain some things
11:18 - that's why so this is the last the
11:20 - average time this is the best time the
11:23 - what what time I am trying to tell you
11:25 - like this is the round trip time like
11:27 - when the packet goes from the source to
11:30 - destination and then the packet uh like
11:32 - the DC sender receives the response from
11:35 - the
11:36 - receiver like that time that is a round
11:38 - trip time okay so this is the average
11:40 - best worst and this is the standard
11:42 - deviation
11:43 - okay
11:45 - latency something uh this is the last
11:48 - one
11:50 - so guys that's all for this video and I
11:53 - hope you liked it and if you have any
11:55 - queries then please ask us in the
11:56 - comment section so thank you thank you
11:58 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
12:00 - video

Cleaned transcript:

now in this particular video we are going to learn about one of the most important command that is the MTR command okay so basically uh MTR command is nothing but like combination of the two commas which we have learned in our previous videos that is the Ping and the trace root command so now in this video we are going to learn about this and we will use like see the both the features of the pink command and the trace root command in this particular single command okay so let's start with the basic like what we have to write that is MTR and enter the then host name I will just go with the google.com and hit enter okay so here we you can see like uh this is refreshing again and again and again okay so basically what's happening here you can see the uh you will get the percentage loss and all the what are the number of packets and whatever has received average based and all these things okay so basically What's Happening Here you here you can see the number of hops like from our what you could say from our source to the destination okay so there are approx 10 hops here in this case so uh like basically with this command you are getting the overall uh what you can say overall statistics and what happens in this particular command as you can see this page is refreshing again and again and again so we started from zero and now we are still at here you can see we are at 48 again 49.50 so what is this happening this is basically nothing but uh the Ping request okay so here uh this command like what it does it sends pin request again and again and again so uh with pink Rick is what we send we send the which protocol we use icmp like internet control message protocol we use okay so uh here you can see that again I will like uh run this command to stop this we have to just hit Q and it will stop okay again let me check with the for another domain uh let's try for gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try for facebook.com so here you can see here also we are getting a 10 hops so there is no any packet loss here in this case okay so this is the again at 11 times that is 13 14 15 16 all these things you can see so to control the your what you can say ping request time like suppose you want to Ping again after some some after some seconds like suppose you want to Ping after two seconds so how you can do it so for this we use a special function not function we will say just it is uh just an option that is a hyphen I option okay so let's uh use that MTR hyphen I and we will specify the time for 2 seconds and for domain name let's go with the YouTube okay so here you can see now it's not like earlier like it's sending the Ping request after two seconds so you can see the like change in the frequency of sending packets okay so here you can see F4 now seven now eight so it's slow slower than earlier okay so in this way you can control the ping request and here you can see the IP addresses of all the hopes which are which lies between our from the source and destination okay so and now moving forward uh suppose if you want to uh display only the what you can say only iPad is not host names like actually we are getting here uh IPL but still there is option of hyphen and so we will use it let me clear the screen MTR hyphen n and uh let's take some basic one uh our Indian website let me search not brave let me open Chrome okay I will search for let's search for blockchain so here okay here is the one website Investopedia okay or here is also blockchain.com is also one kind of website let's let me check it as I've yeah it's live okay we can find the IP and all what are the hops present between this so let me go like this first blockchain.com okay accessible one zero four okay okay now what I will do I will use the hyphen n option blockchain.com so here you can see only iPad is as earlier also we were getting only IP address but so what happens in some cases we get the host names okay we get the host names in place of these IP addresses okay so these are basically your ipv4 added whatever your 32bit addresses okay how we will learn about more about in networking part okay about ipv4 address and IPv6 address okay so moving forward in this video so we will go with uh one of the like uh option with in which we store the output in different different files like the different formats you can say like we can store in XML we can store ingestion and also we can store in uh like other videos file format we can say I'm not getting what are the file formats let me check with uh okay so now here we will see uh what are the file formats uh um hyphen B naught this one local environment packet okay CSV is also there okay here we can see if yeah here you can see iPhone iPhone XML is there we can use hyphen iPhone XML for storing the output in like this okay so let me try with this hyphen hyphen XML google.com whether I will need to provide path or not I don't know okay Ctrl C to stop take one minute I will create One Directory uh 3D Block Chain and NTR iPhone iPhone XML google.com and now it will be sending like it's not displaying us here I will just hit Ctrl CLS okay no files has been created uh my front wall street.xml whether it's lock or not okay it's not working let me check okay uh let's try with CSV okay it's not printing anything I don't know what's the problem here uh basically what happens it displays the output in that particular format like if a head is CS with then comma separated values okay yeah okay we got it now so here you can see uh like this is the comma separated output in this case and if I will try with the XML uh actually uh file is not created the output is displayed in that particular format okay let's wait for our two to three seconds I hope it will work let's wait okay so here you can see uh the output in the XML format nice okay so moving forward uh what I will do uh I will use some other function uh not function I will use some other uh options in which we can like uh create a one file in which you will add some domain names and then we will call that file and use this particular command what I'm just trying to say you let me create one file so just remember how you can create file in Linux we will just use Touch command okay I will enter domain Dot txt and I will write first google.com facebook.com instagram.com okay that's enough Ctrl D to save okay let me check the content of this file not 50 what was the name domain yeah okay here is the domain uh now I will use MTR I will use hyphen f capital F option and provide the uh domain.txt and then the just it I think that's it okay so here you can see we are getting result for google.com okay so you can see the Ping request everything we can see here all statistics okay now further we will see how we can set the Ping okay so like uh normally what happens it sends approx 10 things request okay like one to ten okay if we want for only five how we can do MTR iPhone C5 google.com this is third fourth and the last one is fifth that's it so only five packets have been sent okay okay uh yeah again so here you can see this is a percentage loss here we can see the maximum percentage loss we don't know why and sent okay wait a minute I have to just to explain some things that's why so this is the last the average time this is the best time the what what time I am trying to tell you like this is the round trip time like when the packet goes from the source to destination and then the packet uh like the DC sender receives the response from the receiver like that time that is a round trip time okay so this is the average best worst and this is the standard deviation okay latency something uh this is the last one so guys that's all for this video and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video
