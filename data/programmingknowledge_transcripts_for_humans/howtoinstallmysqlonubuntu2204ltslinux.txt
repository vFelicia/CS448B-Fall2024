00:01 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:03 - you how you can install configure and
00:06 - use MySQL on your Ubuntu operating
00:08 - system so let's get started and let's
00:10 - see how we can do it
00:12 - so first of all open your terminal to
00:14 - open the terminal you can press Ctrl alt
00:17 - T keys and and it will open the terminal
00:20 - or you can just go to the applications
00:25 - and then click on the terminal option
00:28 - once the terminal is open just give
00:31 - these commands I'm going to give these
00:33 - commands in the description of this
00:34 - video also so you can directly copy them
00:37 - the first command is sudo apt update
00:43 - and then press enter and then give your
00:46 - ubuntu's password which is going to
00:48 - update the index of packages on ubunt
00:51 - once that command is finished
00:53 - successfully let me clear the terminal
00:55 - the second command here is sudo apt
01:00 - install
01:03 - MySQL hyphen server okay give this
01:08 - command and then press enter
01:11 - and it's going to install the MySQL
01:14 - server press y here and then press enter
01:16 - once again
01:18 - and let the installation to complete now
01:22 - once this command is successful MySQL
01:24 - server is installed successfully on your
01:26 - Ubuntu operating system
01:28 - so let me clear the terminal once again
01:31 - now in order to check whether
01:34 - MySQL server is started or not on or
01:38 - what is the status of MySQL server
01:40 - service you can give this command which
01:43 - is sudo systemctl
01:47 - status and then the name of your MySQL
01:50 - service which is MySQL dot service
01:55 - and you can see it's active and running
01:58 - if it says it stopped or it crashed or
02:03 - something else what you can do just
02:06 - press on Q
02:08 - on your keyboard and then instead of
02:12 - status you can just give this command
02:16 - start okay so pseudo system CTL start
02:20 - MySQL dot service it's going to start
02:22 - the MySQL service
02:24 - but this command you will only require
02:28 - if you don't see active here active and
02:31 - running here right so in my case it's
02:35 - active and running so I don't need to do
02:37 - anything if it's not active and running
02:39 - in your case you can give this command
02:41 - so that this MySQL dot service is
02:46 - started
02:47 - okay so once that's successful we can
02:51 - start using MySQL on our Ubuntu
02:54 - operating system
02:57 - now just give this command sudo
03:01 - MySQL and then press enter
03:03 - and you are in your MySQL shell right so
03:09 - without doing anything everything is
03:12 - working fine and you can start using the
03:17 - MySQL now if you want to exit from your
03:20 - MySQL client you can just write exit
03:23 - command and then press enter and you
03:25 - came out of your MySQL shell so let me
03:29 - clear the terminal once again now let's
03:32 - do some security related configurations
03:35 - like setting the password and other
03:38 - things and for this you need to run this
03:41 - command which is sudo MySQL
03:47 - underscore
03:49 - secure installation okay so sudo MySQL
03:54 - hyphen secure hyphen installation and
03:57 - press enter
03:58 - and here read all the text carefully
04:02 - right validate password component can be
04:06 - used to test passwords and improve
04:09 - security it checks the strength of
04:11 - password and allow the user to set only
04:15 - those password which are secure enough
04:18 - would you like to validate the password
04:21 - for the demonstration purposes I am
04:23 - going to press no here or n here but in
04:28 - your case if you are doing this in
04:30 - production you might need to choose the
04:33 - y key right so I'm going to choose n for
04:36 - now but in your case you might want to
04:40 - choose the y key
04:42 - Now new password this is the password
04:45 - which you have to give in order to
04:48 - connect to your MySQL server right so
04:51 - choose this password carefully I'm going
04:54 - to choose simple password for the
04:57 - demonstration purposes right I will
04:59 - retype this password and then press
05:02 - enter
05:03 - and it says failed error set password
05:07 - has no significance for user root as
05:13 - authentication method and it also says
05:16 - please consider using alter user instead
05:18 - if you want to change the authentication
05:21 - so let's try to solve this problem
05:25 - so this is the common problem which
05:27 - occurs and you don't need to worry about
05:30 - this this is a very common problem so
05:34 - for now I will just close the this
05:36 - terminal you can just close this without
05:39 - doing anything open a new terminal and
05:42 - let's see how we can solve this problem
05:45 - right so just write sudo MySQL command
05:49 - and then give your ubuntu's password
05:51 - which will lead you to this MySQL shell
05:55 - and here you need to give this command
05:58 - alter user root add a layered localhost
06:02 - identified with mySQL native password by
06:08 - your password so here you can give a
06:10 - very simple password or complex password
06:12 - it depends on you I'm going to give the
06:14 - very simple password which is root here
06:17 - let me copy this uh line I'm going to
06:20 - give this command in the description of
06:22 - this video also and then paste it here
06:26 - in the MySQL shell right and then press
06:29 - enter
06:30 - it says query okay zero rows affected
06:34 - right and then you can exit out of the
06:39 - MySQL shell okay
06:41 - once again give this pseudo MySQL secure
06:44 - installation command and then it's
06:48 - asking me to give the root password so
06:51 - I'm going to give the same password
06:53 - which I have provided here which is Root
06:55 - in my case right
06:57 - so I'm going to just write root
07:00 - and here once again it's asking me to
07:04 - choose a strong or
07:07 - weak password for my case as I said I
07:10 - will select no but in your case you
07:13 - might want to select a very strong
07:15 - password
07:16 - and then
07:18 - it says change the password for root I
07:22 - have already set the password so I don't
07:24 - want to do this if you want you can
07:26 - change it I will just press any other
07:28 - key to just move forward and in the next
07:31 - step it says by default MySQL
07:33 - installation has an anonymous user
07:36 - allowing everyone to log into MySQL
07:39 - without having to uh have a user account
07:43 - created for them right so as I said this
07:46 - is for the learning purposes and the
07:48 - demonstration purposes so I'm going to
07:50 - select n in your case you might want to
07:54 - choose why if you want to run this in
07:57 - the production environment
07:59 - and then
08:00 - it says normally root should only be
08:03 - allowed to connect from localhost this
08:06 - ensures someone cannot guess uh at the
08:10 - root password from the network this
08:12 - allow root login remotely I will say no
08:15 - once again press enter
08:18 - remove test database I don't want to
08:20 - remove test with database so I will say
08:23 - no again and then press enter
08:25 - and it says reload privilege table now
08:29 - I will say yes and then press enter and
08:33 - everything is done successfully
08:37 - now let's again try to uh log into MySQL
08:41 - so I will just give this MySQL command
08:44 - and this time I want to use the root
08:46 - user so hyphen you root hyphen p and
08:51 - then press enter and then this time it
08:54 - will ask me to provide the root password
08:57 - right I have set the root password as
09:00 - root as you can see here so I'm going to
09:03 - give the same password you need to give
09:06 - the password you have set and now I'm in
09:09 - my MySQL shell right
09:12 - so everything is working fine now let's
09:15 - try to install the GUI tool to interact
09:18 - with our mySQL database which is called
09:22 - MySQL workbench so to do that let's go
09:26 - to our browser and this time we are
09:28 - going to install MySQL workbench using
09:31 - snap package manager snap package
09:34 - manager is Created from the makers of
09:38 - Ubuntu itself so it's uh
09:40 - nicer way of installing packages just
09:43 - search for SNAP
09:45 - MySQL workbench and the first link which
09:47 - will appear here will be from
09:49 - snapcraft.io so just click on that link
09:51 - and from here you can install different
09:54 - versions right
09:55 - just click on install button here and
09:58 - then copy this command which is sudo
10:00 - snap install MySQL workbench community
10:03 - and then uh let me just exit from this
10:07 - terminal clear this terminal and then
10:11 - paste this command here
10:13 - which is sudo snap install MySQL
10:16 - workbench Community it's going to
10:18 - install this GUI client for MySQL so
10:22 - that you can use this quick client from
10:25 - next time to interact with your MySQL
10:30 - server right once this command is
10:32 - finished uh MySQL workbench is installed
10:36 - so you can either go to your application
10:39 - and search for
10:41 - MySQL workbench and you can see this
10:44 - icon here MySQL workbench click on the
10:47 - MySQL workbench let me minimize
10:49 - everything else here
10:52 - and then
10:54 - it's going to start this MySQL workbench
10:56 - here right
10:58 - the default port for MySQL is 3306 you
11:03 - can see
11:04 - so I can just click on this local
11:08 - instance connection here
11:10 - and here you need to give the password
11:13 - as I said in my case the password is
11:16 - simple which is root which I have set
11:19 - but
11:20 - if you have said different password give
11:22 - the password here and then click on OK
11:25 - which is going to connect to your local
11:27 - MySQL server and it's going to show you
11:30 - this kind of interface right
11:34 - so now here you can see all instances
11:38 - server status client connections right
11:41 - so everything you will be able to see
11:44 - from this MySQL workbench
11:47 - so here you have the option to create
11:51 - tables option to create schemas and all
11:56 - the other things right so this is how
11:59 - you can
12:00 - install MySQL workbench which is a GUI
12:04 - tool to interact with your mySQL
12:07 - database so here
12:09 - you can see you have the option to
12:11 - connect to your database if you have
12:13 - already created a database and if you
12:17 - haven't created a database you can
12:20 - create one so default schema the schema
12:23 - to use as default schema leave blank to
12:27 - select later right click ok
12:30 - and then you are connected to the local
12:34 - instance which is here also we were
12:37 - already connected to the local instance
12:40 - already
12:41 - in the first tab
12:44 - so that's it for this video I hope
12:46 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
12:47 - you in the next video
