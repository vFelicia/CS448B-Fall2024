00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:01 - we are going to learn about the PS
00:03 - command okay so basically what is a PS
00:05 - command why we use it we will discuss
00:07 - each and everything in this particular
00:09 - video okay so what is the speeds uh but
00:12 - before that we just increase the font
00:14 - size now I hope it is visible so PS is
00:16 - nothing but uh
00:18 - process State what does it mean it
00:21 - basically means it just gives us the
00:23 - information out straight of any process
00:25 - okay it we will get the PID of a number
00:29 - the name of the command who is the user
00:32 - using that particular process so we will
00:34 - get each and every information on the
00:35 - process
00:36 - but before starting and going into the
00:38 - deep inside of this topic you should
00:41 - know what is the process so process is
00:43 - nothing but the execution of a program
00:46 - when I open this Firefox it will become
00:48 - one of the process when I will hit this
00:50 - particular thing it will become one of
00:52 - the possible I know it is like
00:55 - Anyway come on but still if I will open
00:58 - any this music rhythm box then it will
01:01 - become one of the process of process and
01:03 - nothing but the execution of a program
01:06 - okay so now let's uh
01:10 - play with this PS command so when you
01:12 - will enter the PS it basically gives you
01:15 - the like status of this current cell
01:17 - what are the processes running in this
01:20 - particular uh cell like this is one of
01:22 - the cell if I will open another window
01:24 - of terminal it will give me the other
01:26 - share okay
01:28 - so here you can see we are just getting
01:31 - this PS the command which entered just
01:33 - and this is the bash is one of the like
01:36 - you can say uh shell which acts like a
01:40 - parent uh process like some other person
01:43 - use this bash to execute some kind of
01:47 - that task okay so now let's basically
01:50 - talk about the what are these four types
01:52 - of uh like what is this like p i d t y
01:55 - okay so let's start with the PID
01:59 - okay so what if a PID is nothing but the
02:02 - process ID what does it mean it
02:04 - basically gives us you the unique
02:06 - identification number of a process like
02:09 - uh
02:11 - let me tell you the example of suppose
02:14 - in a family member or each and everyone
02:16 - will have the different name okay not a
02:19 - like two person will have the same name
02:22 - in a group of like family of two two are
02:26 - not two five to six members okay
02:28 - similarly this PID is there like process
02:30 - ID it uniquely identifies each and every
02:34 - process in this operating system okay it
02:37 - just gives you the particular number of
02:38 - four digit at all
02:40 - so if that is clear to you what is the
02:42 - process ID you know moving forward that
02:43 - if TTY is not equal to terminal type it
02:46 - gives you the information about what
02:47 - type of terminal has been used by the
02:49 - user
02:51 - let me just write uh
02:53 - terminal type and yeah if you are just
02:56 - watching this video so don't just keep
02:58 - watching uh make notes also so that will
03:01 - be
03:01 - helpful for you for your further use now
03:04 - this is the time in the name but the CPU
03:07 - utilization time by the process so here
03:09 - it is 0 because no any other process
03:11 - using this Bash
03:14 - shell or best command okay so this is
03:17 - huge CPU utilization
03:23 - now moving forward the CMD is nothing
03:25 - but a command which is used by like what
03:27 - commands have been applied for this
03:29 - particular process
03:31 - okay so I hope it is clear to you like
03:34 - what is PID TTY times CMD okay now
03:39 - moving forward now you will be thinking
03:41 - about why there is only two processes
03:44 - which is fine because it in PS files by
03:47 - default displays the current uh process
03:50 - in a credential okay
03:52 - so to get more information about the
03:54 - different processes like on a board time
03:56 - there are multiple processor runs like
03:58 - onboarding of our system so let me just
04:02 - uh enter this PSI form a so here you can
04:07 - see there are the multiple processes you
04:09 - can see like what are the commands has
04:11 - been used like
04:13 - system d
04:16 - SCSI polka diet
04:18 - okay this one colored so there are many
04:22 - processors here you can see in this
04:24 - particular
04:25 - like the screen so here you can see the
04:28 - PS command is also there uh like the PID
04:31 - 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is
04:34 - that like if the PS command switches the
04:37 - result from this particular directory
04:39 - if you do LS then here you will get the
04:42 - information about the particular thing
04:49 - okay so uh in this particular directory
04:52 - you can see many files are there like
04:53 - like it basically fetches the particular
04:56 - information from this particular
04:59 - directory okay now leave it I just move
05:01 - it on to the root directory
05:04 - now moving forward or suppose I just
05:07 - create one process
05:09 - okay let me just create one process but
05:12 - before that I want to tell you one
05:14 - command that is the one option that PS
05:16 - hyphen C
05:18 - discount basically uh option what
05:20 - basically it does it basically uh like
05:23 - gives you the information about the
05:24 - particular process which you want okay
05:26 - in case if you want to get information
05:28 - about the particular process uh then you
05:31 - can hit the name of that particular
05:32 - process here suppose I need information
05:34 - about the file folks okay which is no
05:36 - it's not running so I can get this so
05:39 - now what I will do I will just first
05:40 - clear the screen and I will open up this
05:42 - particular
05:43 - Firefox so now what will happen when I
05:46 - will click on this firework one process
05:47 - is getting created and then the PID is
05:51 - given to that particular process and you
05:53 - will see that in this
05:54 - like uh now in a seconds okay so let's
05:58 - do it now you can see the this powerful
06:00 - service started now I will use this PS
06:03 - hyphen C and the name of the person that
06:05 - is the Firefox
06:08 - so here you can see like from 10 seconds
06:11 - utilizing the CPU and the PID is given
06:14 - and the command is using like
06:17 - Firefox okay like you will say like you
06:21 - you are not use this phone but yeah
06:24 - let me show you if I will identified of
06:27 - the Firefox again the one terminal five
06:29 - I will start okay it's showing fail to
06:31 - load
06:33 - yeah but some module is filled but
06:34 - pistol here you can see one Firefox
06:36 - window has been a paid if I'll just
06:38 - close it
06:40 - okay so that uh this is the first one
06:44 - okay so in this way you can see the
06:46 - information about the particular process
06:48 - and if let me just enter one more
06:52 - command if I will hit hit cat and it is
06:54 - now in the weight estate like it is just
06:57 - what we can say asking for the user
07:01 - input whatever I will write and anything
07:03 - okay it is just waiting for the user
07:05 - input so I can use this command also I
07:09 - like I will write your cat and here you
07:12 - can see the PID is assigned to this
07:14 - particular process
07:15 - okay so now what I will do uh if I want
07:19 - to just kill any process I want to just
07:24 - what we can say this card in current any
07:26 - processor now I can use the kill command
07:28 - and I will just give pass the parameter
07:30 - as this PID
07:32 - foreign
07:34 - and then here you will see like
07:39 - let's see what happens so here you can
07:40 - say terminated the cat is now terminated
07:44 - and similarly you can do for this what
07:47 - you can say for Firefox also but before
07:49 - that uh let me just uh
07:51 - use hyphen a option to again view the
07:54 - all the processes so when I will clear
07:56 - not okay I will clear this can just do
07:59 - psyphenate and here you can see
08:03 - uh what is the PID 6214
08:08 - let me check whether it is visible or
08:10 - not yeah here you can see the six two
08:12 - six two and four PID is
08:15 - generated okay what if I will kill this
08:18 - six to one for what will happen the
08:20 - Firefox window will get close okay
08:23 - so you can see now again I will use PSI
08:25 - funny
08:26 - so here you can see there is no six two
08:28 - one four and also know there is web
08:31 - content uh like what you can say web
08:35 - content command or any process is not
08:37 - displaying here as you can see in the
08:39 - previous command here while it is move
08:41 - packet you can see the web content
08:43 - process was also there so in this what
08:45 - had happened uh the 6214 PID was the
08:48 - parent process and under this process
08:50 - there are many other processes like here
08:52 - you can see the web extensions web
08:55 - content and all those things okay
08:58 - so in this way we can use this PS
09:02 - command to get the process of
09:04 - any particular uh application or any
09:08 - command okay now moving forward about
09:10 - another option that is the PS hyphen U
09:14 - okay so what does basically going to do
09:17 - what uh
09:19 - this one do so hyphen new option b is
09:23 - basically used to giving the like you
09:25 - want to get the information over to some
09:27 - particular user so if I use a value show
09:30 - I will get this information
09:32 - so these are the process which are being
09:35 - used by my commander
09:37 - not by my command sorry uh by me
09:40 - actually I use one of the user of this
09:42 - operating system if I have your room
09:48 - hyphen you wrote
09:50 - so as you can see the uh
09:53 - these are some processes which are being
09:54 - used by the
09:57 - root user okay
09:59 - so also there were one more option that
10:02 - is the aux option PS command which is
10:04 - used for getting detailed information
10:07 - over the processes
10:09 - so PS iPhone aux displays the result in
10:12 - more detail format okay so here you can
10:15 - see the name of the user is like display
10:19 - like whatever user is using this
10:21 - particular
10:22 - command this particular process and the
10:25 - virtual memory utilization
10:27 - TTYL terminal type stats start when the
10:30 - process started so here you can see the
10:32 - 549 at 549 actually I had started by the
10:35 - system
10:36 - so it is playing like on boot time this
10:39 - process has been
10:41 - started so you can see all the
10:44 - information but now here you can see
10:46 - here six one this process and now see at
10:50 - 6 59 this command was the was
10:55 - used okay
10:58 - so in this way you can get the detailed
10:59 - information about uh
11:03 - your process
11:04 - okay also you can use a psyphen ax to
11:09 - get the running processes so here you
11:11 - can see these are the running processors
11:14 - okay
11:16 - uh okay yeah this is the time command
11:19 - start okay
11:22 - so that's all for today's videos guys I
11:24 - hope you liked it and it was a very uh
11:27 - interesting thing like to get uh like uh
11:30 - what are the process being used in your
11:32 - operating system if you learn more about
11:34 - this you will get to learn also more
11:37 - like when you will explore personally
11:40 - then obviously we'll get to learn more
11:42 - about this
11:43 - so that's all for this video and we'll
11:45 - meet you in the next one with another
11:47 - interesting command uh okay so maybe I
11:50 - will create video on top command after
11:51 - this so let's meet in the next one so
11:53 - thank you for watching bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys now in this particular video we are going to learn about the PS command okay so basically what is a PS command why we use it we will discuss each and everything in this particular video okay so what is the speeds uh but before that we just increase the font size now I hope it is visible so PS is nothing but uh process State what does it mean it basically means it just gives us the information out straight of any process okay it we will get the PID of a number the name of the command who is the user using that particular process so we will get each and every information on the process but before starting and going into the deep inside of this topic you should know what is the process so process is nothing but the execution of a program when I open this Firefox it will become one of the process when I will hit this particular thing it will become one of the possible I know it is like Anyway come on but still if I will open any this music rhythm box then it will become one of the process of process and nothing but the execution of a program okay so now let's uh play with this PS command so when you will enter the PS it basically gives you the like status of this current cell what are the processes running in this particular uh cell like this is one of the cell if I will open another window of terminal it will give me the other share okay so here you can see we are just getting this PS the command which entered just and this is the bash is one of the like you can say uh shell which acts like a parent uh process like some other person use this bash to execute some kind of that task okay so now let's basically talk about the what are these four types of uh like what is this like p i d t y okay so let's start with the PID okay so what if a PID is nothing but the process ID what does it mean it basically gives us you the unique identification number of a process like uh let me tell you the example of suppose in a family member or each and everyone will have the different name okay not a like two person will have the same name in a group of like family of two two are not two five to six members okay similarly this PID is there like process ID it uniquely identifies each and every process in this operating system okay it just gives you the particular number of four digit at all so if that is clear to you what is the process ID you know moving forward that if TTY is not equal to terminal type it gives you the information about what type of terminal has been used by the user let me just write uh terminal type and yeah if you are just watching this video so don't just keep watching uh make notes also so that will be helpful for you for your further use now this is the time in the name but the CPU utilization time by the process so here it is 0 because no any other process using this Bash shell or best command okay so this is huge CPU utilization now moving forward the CMD is nothing but a command which is used by like what commands have been applied for this particular process okay so I hope it is clear to you like what is PID TTY times CMD okay now moving forward now you will be thinking about why there is only two processes which is fine because it in PS files by default displays the current uh process in a credential okay so to get more information about the different processes like on a board time there are multiple processor runs like onboarding of our system so let me just uh enter this PSI form a so here you can see there are the multiple processes you can see like what are the commands has been used like system d SCSI polka diet okay this one colored so there are many processors here you can see in this particular like the screen so here you can see the PS command is also there uh like the PID 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is that like if the PS command switches the result from this particular directory if you do LS then here you will get the information about the particular thing okay so uh in this particular directory you can see many files are there like like it basically fetches the particular information from this particular directory okay now leave it I just move it on to the root directory now moving forward or suppose I just create one process okay let me just create one process but before that I want to tell you one command that is the one option that PS hyphen C discount basically uh option what basically it does it basically uh like gives you the information about the particular process which you want okay in case if you want to get information about the particular process uh then you can hit the name of that particular process here suppose I need information about the file folks okay which is no it's not running so I can get this so now what I will do I will just first clear the screen and I will open up this particular Firefox so now what will happen when I will click on this firework one process is getting created and then the PID is given to that particular process and you will see that in this like uh now in a seconds okay so let's do it now you can see the this powerful service started now I will use this PS hyphen C and the name of the person that is the Firefox so here you can see like from 10 seconds utilizing the CPU and the PID is given and the command is using like Firefox okay like you will say like you you are not use this phone but yeah let me show you if I will identified of the Firefox again the one terminal five I will start okay it's showing fail to load yeah but some module is filled but pistol here you can see one Firefox window has been a paid if I'll just close it okay so that uh this is the first one okay so in this way you can see the information about the particular process and if let me just enter one more command if I will hit hit cat and it is now in the weight estate like it is just what we can say asking for the user input whatever I will write and anything okay it is just waiting for the user input so I can use this command also I like I will write your cat and here you can see the PID is assigned to this particular process okay so now what I will do uh if I want to just kill any process I want to just what we can say this card in current any processor now I can use the kill command and I will just give pass the parameter as this PID foreign and then here you will see like let's see what happens so here you can say terminated the cat is now terminated and similarly you can do for this what you can say for Firefox also but before that uh let me just uh use hyphen a option to again view the all the processes so when I will clear not okay I will clear this can just do psyphenate and here you can see uh what is the PID 6214 let me check whether it is visible or not yeah here you can see the six two six two and four PID is generated okay what if I will kill this six to one for what will happen the Firefox window will get close okay so you can see now again I will use PSI funny so here you can see there is no six two one four and also know there is web content uh like what you can say web content command or any process is not displaying here as you can see in the previous command here while it is move packet you can see the web content process was also there so in this what had happened uh the 6214 PID was the parent process and under this process there are many other processes like here you can see the web extensions web content and all those things okay so in this way we can use this PS command to get the process of any particular uh application or any command okay now moving forward about another option that is the PS hyphen U okay so what does basically going to do what uh this one do so hyphen new option b is basically used to giving the like you want to get the information over to some particular user so if I use a value show I will get this information so these are the process which are being used by my commander not by my command sorry uh by me actually I use one of the user of this operating system if I have your room hyphen you wrote so as you can see the uh these are some processes which are being used by the root user okay so also there were one more option that is the aux option PS command which is used for getting detailed information over the processes so PS iPhone aux displays the result in more detail format okay so here you can see the name of the user is like display like whatever user is using this particular command this particular process and the virtual memory utilization TTYL terminal type stats start when the process started so here you can see the 549 at 549 actually I had started by the system so it is playing like on boot time this process has been started so you can see all the information but now here you can see here six one this process and now see at 6 59 this command was the was used okay so in this way you can get the detailed information about uh your process okay also you can use a psyphen ax to get the running processes so here you can see these are the running processors okay uh okay yeah this is the time command start okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and it was a very uh interesting thing like to get uh like uh what are the process being used in your operating system if you learn more about this you will get to learn also more like when you will explore personally then obviously we'll get to learn more about this so that's all for this video and we'll meet you in the next one with another interesting command uh okay so maybe I will create video on top command after this so let's meet in the next one so thank you for watching bye
