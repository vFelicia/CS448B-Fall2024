00:01 - hello and welcome back to the new video
00:02 - of the Java tutorial Series so today we
00:04 - will be discussing final keyword in Java
00:07 - okay so the final keyword in Java is
00:10 - used to restrict the user okay the final
00:12 - Java keyword can be used in many con
00:15 - context okay the final can be a variable
00:17 - a final can be a method and a final can
00:21 - be a class okay the final keyword can be
00:23 - applied with this variable a fine a
00:26 - final variable that have no value is
00:28 - called as blank final variable or
00:30 - uninitialized final variable okay and it
00:34 - can be initialized in a Constructor only
00:36 - and the blank final variable can be a
00:39 - static also can be initialized in the
00:41 - static block only and we will be
00:44 - detailed learning of this and let's
00:47 - first learn the basic final keyword okay
00:49 - okay so what is the use cases of the
00:52 - final keyword in Java to stop the value
00:54 - change and to stop the method overriding
00:57 - and to stop the inheritance okay we will
00:59 - we will be using final keyword for these
01:02 - two for these three reasons okay so we
01:05 - will discuss first what is Java final
01:07 - variable okay so let me get into my IDE
01:10 - and I will create one more class name as
01:15 - final
01:19 - keyword okay and let me increase the
01:21 - font size
01:22 - okay so though
01:25 - if you make any variable final you
01:28 - cannot change that value of that final
01:29 - variable it will be constant throughout
01:31 - the code okay so the example of the
01:34 - variable is
01:35 - okay so assume uh try to understand this
01:39 - example there is a final variable called
01:41 - a speed limit okay speed limit of that
01:43 - bike okay we are going to change the
01:46 - value of this variable but it can be
01:48 - changed because the final variable once
01:50 - assigned a value and cannot be changed
01:53 - anywhere in the code okay so let me
01:56 - create
01:58 - one
02:00 - class one not class inside this class
02:03 - let me create one
02:05 - final so to declare the final variable
02:07 - we will write final keyword before that
02:10 - Declaration of that variable okay so the
02:12 - final int
02:14 - so what is the way my
02:17 - variable name is speed
02:19 - limit
02:21 - which is equals to 90
02:24 - and after that I will write void run
02:29 - now inside this
02:32 - I will set my speed limit to
02:36 - uh any any random number 400 okay
02:40 - you can set
02:41 - whatever you want and inside again this
02:44 - I will import my main I will write my
02:47 - main method and I will create one object
02:50 - of this class okay so final keyword obj1
02:56 - is equals to new Final keyword okay and
03:00 - now if I write obj dot run
03:05 - now
03:06 - here you can see if I run this uh
03:09 - IntelliJ IDEA is throwing some errors
03:11 - we'll see what is desire here you can
03:13 - here you can see Java cannot assign a
03:16 - value to a final variable speed limit so
03:19 - here you can see once that variable you
03:21 - once you declare a variable as a final
03:24 - and you assign a value to it you cannot
03:27 - change that value again okay inside this
03:30 - line number four we are we are trying to
03:32 - change the value of the speed limit to
03:33 - 400 and it is giving me error saying
03:36 - that cannot assign a value to the final
03:38 - variable speed limit because it is
03:40 - already already over here at line number
03:42 - two we have declared value to it okay
03:45 - so we'll see
03:47 - next up Java final method okay what is
03:50 - our final method we will see
03:52 - I will take the same example let me
03:56 - comment this out
03:57 - and this one also okay and inside this
04:01 - class
04:02 - itself I will write one final method
04:06 - void
04:08 - run
04:10 - now inside this I will write simply
04:14 - print
04:15 - something random string running
04:18 - okay and now uh inside my main method I
04:24 - will create one object of this class and
04:26 - I will write obj1. run okay
04:30 - and now if I
04:32 - call this
04:35 - it is simply printing running okay now I
04:38 - will show what is the
04:40 - consequences if you write one method as
04:44 - a final and you are trying to call that
04:47 - method inside another class okay and now
04:49 - I will let me just
04:51 - I will write one more class
04:56 - uh any name by company let's suppose BMW
05:02 - and this BMW class is extending my
05:07 - oh okay wait wait wait wait wait
05:11 - to explain this I need one more class
05:14 - which is the parent class I will declare
05:17 - it over here
05:20 - class
05:22 - bike and inside this I will write final
05:25 - void run running okay and now this is my
05:30 - BMW class and which is extending my
05:34 - by class
05:37 - and set this I will write
05:41 - void
05:43 - run
05:45 - and inside this I will write
05:49 - yes
05:51 - sound
05:53 - BMW it's
05:56 - running okay and now if I create the
06:00 - object of this
06:02 - b m w class
06:07 - foreign
06:11 - method inside this main method
06:14 - you'll see
06:17 - when error should be there
06:19 - we'll see what is that error
06:23 - IntelliJ IDEA okay the Java run in BMW
06:26 - cannot override run in bike overridden
06:29 - method is file is final okay so here you
06:32 - can see Java is telling me that you are
06:34 - trying to override one method name as
06:37 - void run which is declared inside the
06:40 - parent class bike as a final method okay
06:43 - you cannot overwrite that final method
06:45 - inside any of the child class once you
06:49 - declare it as a final
06:50 - final method okay
06:52 - so go this is an example of the Java
06:54 - final method you'll see Java final class
06:57 - method also example sorry not method and
07:02 - now
07:04 - I'll make some changes over itself I
07:07 - will declare it as final class bike okay
07:10 - and I will remove this final keyword
07:15 - from here okay nothing
07:19 - okay and now if I try to run this code
07:25 - I should get one error yes cannot
07:28 - inherit from by final bike okay uh you
07:31 - have declared this bike class as a final
07:34 - and you cannot inherit this class inside
07:36 - any of the child class okay and and you
07:39 - in like line number 19 we are trying to
07:41 - we are trying to inherit this by class
07:44 - inside this BMW class and here itself
07:47 - IntelliJ IDEA is telling me that cannot
07:49 - inherit from final bike okay so this is
07:52 - one example of the class where we have
07:55 - declared class as a final okay now we'll
07:58 - see some popular questions which is
08:00 - asked in the interview rounds okay is
08:03 - final method inherited yes the final
08:06 - method eliminated but you cannot
08:08 - override it okay as we as we have seen
08:10 - here okay
08:12 - now one more question is there what is
08:15 - the wait let me take can we initialize
08:19 - blank final variable uh yes but only in
08:23 - the Constructor if you want to
08:25 - initialize uh here I will give you an
08:28 - example here we have written Final End
08:31 - speed limit and we have assigned it
08:33 - value as 90. if you want uh to
08:36 - initialize this variable as a blank
08:39 - variable you just simply uh cancel that
08:41 - assigned value as 90 and then again you
08:46 - can write it here speed limit is equal
08:48 - to 70 and if you are trying to print
08:51 - this speed limit at that time the speed
08:54 - limit will be get printed on the console
08:55 - as 400 because you have initialized over
08:58 - it over here but the only thing is you
09:00 - have to initialize the limit speed limit
09:02 - value inside the
09:04 - Constructor of that class not in the
09:06 - method so here we are written method if
09:08 - you if you write a Constructor for this
09:11 - final keyword class and inside that
09:12 - class if you write speed limit is equal
09:14 - to 400 the value of the speed limit is
09:16 - uh
09:18 - set to 400 itself okay so this is pretty
09:22 - much idea behind the final keyword in
09:23 - Java I hope you guys understood it thank
09:26 - you for watching this video

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to the new video of the Java tutorial Series so today we will be discussing final keyword in Java okay so the final keyword in Java is used to restrict the user okay the final Java keyword can be used in many con context okay the final can be a variable a final can be a method and a final can be a class okay the final keyword can be applied with this variable a fine a final variable that have no value is called as blank final variable or uninitialized final variable okay and it can be initialized in a Constructor only and the blank final variable can be a static also can be initialized in the static block only and we will be detailed learning of this and let's first learn the basic final keyword okay okay so what is the use cases of the final keyword in Java to stop the value change and to stop the method overriding and to stop the inheritance okay we will we will be using final keyword for these two for these three reasons okay so we will discuss first what is Java final variable okay so let me get into my IDE and I will create one more class name as final keyword okay and let me increase the font size okay so though if you make any variable final you cannot change that value of that final variable it will be constant throughout the code okay so the example of the variable is okay so assume uh try to understand this example there is a final variable called a speed limit okay speed limit of that bike okay we are going to change the value of this variable but it can be changed because the final variable once assigned a value and cannot be changed anywhere in the code okay so let me create one class one not class inside this class let me create one final so to declare the final variable we will write final keyword before that Declaration of that variable okay so the final int so what is the way my variable name is speed limit which is equals to 90 and after that I will write void run now inside this I will set my speed limit to uh any any random number 400 okay you can set whatever you want and inside again this I will import my main I will write my main method and I will create one object of this class okay so final keyword obj1 is equals to new Final keyword okay and now if I write obj dot run now here you can see if I run this uh IntelliJ IDEA is throwing some errors we'll see what is desire here you can here you can see Java cannot assign a value to a final variable speed limit so here you can see once that variable you once you declare a variable as a final and you assign a value to it you cannot change that value again okay inside this line number four we are we are trying to change the value of the speed limit to 400 and it is giving me error saying that cannot assign a value to the final variable speed limit because it is already already over here at line number two we have declared value to it okay so we'll see next up Java final method okay what is our final method we will see I will take the same example let me comment this out and this one also okay and inside this class itself I will write one final method void run now inside this I will write simply print something random string running okay and now uh inside my main method I will create one object of this class and I will write obj1. run okay and now if I call this it is simply printing running okay now I will show what is the consequences if you write one method as a final and you are trying to call that method inside another class okay and now I will let me just I will write one more class uh any name by company let's suppose BMW and this BMW class is extending my oh okay wait wait wait wait wait to explain this I need one more class which is the parent class I will declare it over here class bike and inside this I will write final void run running okay and now this is my BMW class and which is extending my by class and set this I will write void run and inside this I will write yes sound BMW it's running okay and now if I create the object of this b m w class foreign method inside this main method you'll see when error should be there we'll see what is that error IntelliJ IDEA okay the Java run in BMW cannot override run in bike overridden method is file is final okay so here you can see Java is telling me that you are trying to override one method name as void run which is declared inside the parent class bike as a final method okay you cannot overwrite that final method inside any of the child class once you declare it as a final final method okay so go this is an example of the Java final method you'll see Java final class method also example sorry not method and now I'll make some changes over itself I will declare it as final class bike okay and I will remove this final keyword from here okay nothing okay and now if I try to run this code I should get one error yes cannot inherit from by final bike okay uh you have declared this bike class as a final and you cannot inherit this class inside any of the child class okay and and you in like line number 19 we are trying to we are trying to inherit this by class inside this BMW class and here itself IntelliJ IDEA is telling me that cannot inherit from final bike okay so this is one example of the class where we have declared class as a final okay now we'll see some popular questions which is asked in the interview rounds okay is final method inherited yes the final method eliminated but you cannot override it okay as we as we have seen here okay now one more question is there what is the wait let me take can we initialize blank final variable uh yes but only in the Constructor if you want to initialize uh here I will give you an example here we have written Final End speed limit and we have assigned it value as 90. if you want uh to initialize this variable as a blank variable you just simply uh cancel that assigned value as 90 and then again you can write it here speed limit is equal to 70 and if you are trying to print this speed limit at that time the speed limit will be get printed on the console as 400 because you have initialized over it over here but the only thing is you have to initialize the limit speed limit value inside the Constructor of that class not in the method so here we are written method if you if you write a Constructor for this final keyword class and inside that class if you write speed limit is equal to 400 the value of the speed limit is uh set to 400 itself okay so this is pretty much idea behind the final keyword in Java I hope you guys understood it thank you for watching this video
