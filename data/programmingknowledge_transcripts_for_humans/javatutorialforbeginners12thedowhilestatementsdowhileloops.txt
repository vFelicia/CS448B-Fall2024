00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - what is do while loop in the last video
00:11 - we have seen how to use while loop like
00:13 - this do while loop is also a kind of
00:17 - loop but it's slightly different from
00:20 - while loop uh and I will show you uh the
00:24 - difference uh once I show you how to use
00:27 - it so I will leave uh this code as it is
00:32 - which I have shown you in the last video
00:35 - so if you don't know how to use while
00:37 - loop just see the last video and this I
00:41 - will leave it as it is to show the
00:43 - difference between while loop and Y Loop
00:47 - and just below this while loop I will
00:49 - declare one more variable int B whose
00:53 - value is also zero okay I have
00:58 - initialized a
01:00 - in the last video as zero and now I'm
01:04 - initializing b as zero and let's see the
01:08 - syntax of do while loop now so first of
01:12 - all you write the keyword do and then
01:16 - you write these curly braces and at the
01:19 - end of your curly braces you just
01:23 - write while and then in this round
01:27 - brackets comes your expression which you
01:31 - want to
01:32 - evaluate and this will be the Boolean
01:35 - expression let's say in the last video
01:38 - we have uh given this condition I will
01:41 - copy the same condition in this while
01:43 - loop expression but this will be B we
01:46 - are evaluating the value of B right so
01:50 - this is our basic Syntax for do while
01:53 - loop and I'm also going to print the
01:56 - value of B and I will increase the value
01:59 - of B by 1 as I have done in the last
02:03 - video so here I'm printing the value of
02:06 - B and I'm increasing the value of
02:09 - B by one now let's see the basic
02:14 - difference between while and do while
02:17 - loop
02:18 - let's print some line or something in
02:23 - between so that uh we know that while
02:27 - loop ends and do while loops starts so
02:31 - this will be the separator between the
02:33 - two lines
02:34 - right so let's uh try to run the
02:40 - program and now the program has
02:45 - successfully run and now the result is
02:49 - this one so for the first time when you
02:53 - see it uh you know shows no difference
02:57 - between uh the results right but the
03:01 - basic difference between V Loop and do
03:05 - while loop is that y Loop first
03:10 - evaluates the condition and then
03:14 - executes your statement and do while
03:17 - loop executes so it do first so it
03:22 - executes your statement first and then
03:25 - evaluates your condition right so for
03:30 - example I want to check if the value of
03:33 - uh A is for
03:38 - example
03:40 - min-1 here okay which is not and here
03:44 - also value of B is minus1 here I'm
03:48 - checking if it's uh less than or equal
03:51 - to minus1 and in y Loop also I'm
03:53 - checking if it's equal to or less than
03:56 - minus one and then I run the program
04:00 - what it does this y Loop will not be
04:05 - executed because we are evaluating this
04:08 - condition and in here the value of a is
04:11 - equal to0 and this condition is false
04:14 - because 0 is not less than or equal to
04:16 - minus1 so this will not be
04:19 - executed at all right and then our line
04:24 - prints so this line prints so above this
04:28 - line there is nothing as result as you
04:31 - can see here but below this line we have
04:34 - a result zero so why this is printing
04:38 - zero here because it first executes your
04:43 - statement so the value of B is zero and
04:45 - it prints your statement and then
04:47 - increase the value of B by one and then
04:51 - it evaluates the condition right so even
04:56 - if the condition is false the do do
04:59 - while
05:00 - loop at least once it will be executed
05:04 - do while loop statement at least once it
05:07 - will be executed and then your condition
05:11 - will be evaluated so this is the basic
05:14 - difference between while and do while
05:16 - loop while loop first evaluates the
05:19 - condition and then if the condition is
05:21 - true it executes the statement and do
05:25 - while loop
05:26 - first executes your statement and then
05:29 - check if the condition is true or false
05:32 - and then once again it will you know uh
05:35 - executes your statement if the condition
05:36 - is true so do while loop at least once
05:41 - it will execute if the condition is
05:44 - false so this is uh how you can use do
05:48 - while loop and this is uh the difference
05:51 - between while and do while loop I hope
05:54 - you understood the basic concept and
05:56 - hope you enjoyed the video please rate

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is do while loop in the last video we have seen how to use while loop like this do while loop is also a kind of loop but it's slightly different from while loop uh and I will show you uh the difference uh once I show you how to use it so I will leave uh this code as it is which I have shown you in the last video so if you don't know how to use while loop just see the last video and this I will leave it as it is to show the difference between while loop and Y Loop and just below this while loop I will declare one more variable int B whose value is also zero okay I have initialized a in the last video as zero and now I'm initializing b as zero and let's see the syntax of do while loop now so first of all you write the keyword do and then you write these curly braces and at the end of your curly braces you just write while and then in this round brackets comes your expression which you want to evaluate and this will be the Boolean expression let's say in the last video we have uh given this condition I will copy the same condition in this while loop expression but this will be B we are evaluating the value of B right so this is our basic Syntax for do while loop and I'm also going to print the value of B and I will increase the value of B by 1 as I have done in the last video so here I'm printing the value of B and I'm increasing the value of B by one now let's see the basic difference between while and do while loop let's print some line or something in between so that uh we know that while loop ends and do while loops starts so this will be the separator between the two lines right so let's uh try to run the program and now the program has successfully run and now the result is this one so for the first time when you see it uh you know shows no difference between uh the results right but the basic difference between V Loop and do while loop is that y Loop first evaluates the condition and then executes your statement and do while loop executes so it do first so it executes your statement first and then evaluates your condition right so for example I want to check if the value of uh A is for example min1 here okay which is not and here also value of B is minus1 here I'm checking if it's uh less than or equal to minus1 and in y Loop also I'm checking if it's equal to or less than minus one and then I run the program what it does this y Loop will not be executed because we are evaluating this condition and in here the value of a is equal to0 and this condition is false because 0 is not less than or equal to minus1 so this will not be executed at all right and then our line prints so this line prints so above this line there is nothing as result as you can see here but below this line we have a result zero so why this is printing zero here because it first executes your statement so the value of B is zero and it prints your statement and then increase the value of B by one and then it evaluates the condition right so even if the condition is false the do do while loop at least once it will be executed do while loop statement at least once it will be executed and then your condition will be evaluated so this is the basic difference between while and do while loop while loop first evaluates the condition and then if the condition is true it executes the statement and do while loop first executes your statement and then check if the condition is true or false and then once again it will you know uh executes your statement if the condition is true so do while loop at least once it will execute if the condition is false so this is uh how you can use do while loop and this is uh the difference between while and do while loop I hope you understood the basic concept and hope you enjoyed the video please rate comment and subscribe and for now
