00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:04 - and in this video I'm going to teach you
00:06 - about simple math and math operators in
00:12 - C
00:12 - programming so basically there are some
00:16 - uh
00:17 - operators which you can use to do your
00:22 - math in C and these are called
00:27 - multiplicative and additive
00:30 - operators and the first operator is this
00:34 - plus symbol which is used for addition
00:37 - second is minus symbol which is used for
00:41 - subtraction third is srix which is used
00:45 - for
00:46 - multiplication fourth is this for
00:49 - forward slash which is used for division
00:53 - and the last is this modulus uh operator
00:57 - which is also called modulus so these
01:00 - are called
01:01 - multiplicative and additive
01:04 - operators now how we can use them so for
01:08 - example we have two
01:10 - numbers
01:12 - in
01:14 - a is equal to 23 for example and comma B
01:22 - is equal
01:23 - to
01:25 - 45 and you want to add these two numbers
01:29 - how you can add these two numbers you
01:31 - can just declare another variable called
01:35 - sum and then you can add these two
01:38 - numbers like sum is equal to a +
01:44 - b okay and the result you can print it
01:49 - in print F function so you can just
01:54 - say
01:57 - sum is equal to perent percentage D okay
02:02 - and comma your sum function sum variable
02:06 - okay which is this one you can just
02:09 - compile and run this program and it
02:12 - returns error because I forgot semicolon
02:15 - save your program and compile and run
02:19 - your program and it will give the sum of
02:22 - 23 and
02:24 - 45 right so it will just print sum is
02:28 - equal to whatever is the sum of these
02:30 - two values which is 68 like this
02:34 - okay now in the same way if you want to
02:37 - divide or subtract these two numbers so
02:40 - I want to subtract 23 by 45 we just do a
02:46 - minus B which will be a minus value
02:49 - right so I will just compile and run my
02:53 - program and this will not be uh sum but
02:56 - the subtraction I forgot to change the
02:58 - variable name
03:00 - but the result will be the subtraction
03:03 - of these two numbers which is 22 right
03:06 - so you can just name this sum instead of
03:08 - sum when you are doing subtraction you
03:11 - can name it as subtraction for example
03:14 - now in order to uh get the
03:16 - multiplication you just change the
03:18 - variable name as
03:20 - multiplication and just use estx for the
03:25 - multiplication right so a estx b will
03:29 - give you the multiplication of these two
03:31 - numbers and here you can say is
03:37 - product product is equal to this uh
03:43 - multiplication
03:44 - okay and compile and run the program it
03:47 - will give the multiplication of these
03:49 - two
03:51 - numbers and in the similar way if you
03:54 - want to divide two numbers this is
03:57 - interesting so this is the product of of
03:59 - these two numbers and in order to divide
04:03 - two numbers let's say this is division
04:07 - variable and in order to divide these
04:10 - two numbers you just use forward slash
04:14 - right and let's take two simple numbers
04:17 - first of all for
04:19 - example um 8 and
04:23 - two and I will just build and run this
04:26 - program and it will ideally give give us
04:31 - four because 8 / 2 is
04:35 - 4 right so it gives us four as expected
04:40 - but whenever for example I have nine and
04:44 - I want to divide it by two and by the
04:47 - way this is uh integer values so let's
04:51 - change it to
04:52 - float if uh 9 ID by 2 is 4.5 so that's
04:57 - why we will save it in float variable
04:59 - compile and run the
05:02 - program and it will give
05:04 - us the value let's see what value it
05:08 - gives us first of
05:10 - all and it gives us
05:13 - zero because we haven't change this
05:17 - thing modulus
05:22 - F and compile and run the program in my
05:26 - computer I don't know why it takes a
05:29 - little bit time to compile this program
05:31 - and it gives us four which is not
05:34 - expected because uh 9/ by 2 is
05:38 - 4.5 but what this forward slash symbol
05:42 - do is it will give you the whole
05:44 - division for example uh 9 / by 2 is
05:50 - first of all you will divide 9 by two
05:54 - then you will give four and it will
05:56 - leave the point value so0 five it leave
06:00 - Always by using this you will always get
06:04 - the multiples so four or whenever you
06:07 - have 11 it will give you five and the
06:10 - remainder it will not give you okay and
06:14 - in order to get the remainer so 11 / 2
06:19 - is
06:21 - 5.5 and the when you divide by uh divide
06:25 - 11 by two it'll you know fully div
06:29 - divided by five and it will give the
06:32 - remainder of one right so in order to
06:35 - get the remainder you use this modulus
06:40 - uh operator and let's change it to
06:45 - modulus modulus and modulus and try to
06:50 - run the program and it g it will give
06:52 - one okay so this modulus always gives
06:56 - you the remainder and this division
06:58 - always give you uh the whole multiple
07:02 - values so one and when you use this it
07:06 - will give you five because it will
07:09 - always skip division always skip the
07:11 - remainder and remainder only shows the
07:15 - remainder and nothing else so in this
07:17 - way you can do simple math in C there
07:20 - are other operators in C also which I
07:23 - will show you in the further videos but
07:27 - these are the simple math op operators
07:30 - which are called multiplicative and
07:32 - additive operators and c and you can do
07:35 - math with these
07:37 - operators and one more thing if you uh
07:41 - want to know what is the Precedence of
07:44 - these operators if you uh have seen in
07:49 - uh your schooling you have something
07:52 - like PD Moss or
07:55 - um something like
07:58 - MD
08:00 - as something right and P stands for
08:04 - parenthesis right so parenthesis it has
08:08 - the main priority then multiplication
08:11 - division and then addition and then
08:14 - subtraction so always follow this rule
08:16 - to do the math and you will be good to
08:19 - go I hope you have enjoyed this video
08:21 - please WR comment and subscribe and bye
08:23 - for now

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to teach you about simple math and math operators in C programming so basically there are some uh operators which you can use to do your math in C and these are called multiplicative and additive operators and the first operator is this plus symbol which is used for addition second is minus symbol which is used for subtraction third is srix which is used for multiplication fourth is this for forward slash which is used for division and the last is this modulus uh operator which is also called modulus so these are called multiplicative and additive operators now how we can use them so for example we have two numbers in a is equal to 23 for example and comma B is equal to 45 and you want to add these two numbers how you can add these two numbers you can just declare another variable called sum and then you can add these two numbers like sum is equal to a + b okay and the result you can print it in print F function so you can just say sum is equal to perent percentage D okay and comma your sum function sum variable okay which is this one you can just compile and run this program and it returns error because I forgot semicolon save your program and compile and run your program and it will give the sum of 23 and 45 right so it will just print sum is equal to whatever is the sum of these two values which is 68 like this okay now in the same way if you want to divide or subtract these two numbers so I want to subtract 23 by 45 we just do a minus B which will be a minus value right so I will just compile and run my program and this will not be uh sum but the subtraction I forgot to change the variable name but the result will be the subtraction of these two numbers which is 22 right so you can just name this sum instead of sum when you are doing subtraction you can name it as subtraction for example now in order to uh get the multiplication you just change the variable name as multiplication and just use estx for the multiplication right so a estx b will give you the multiplication of these two numbers and here you can say is product product is equal to this uh multiplication okay and compile and run the program it will give the multiplication of these two numbers and in the similar way if you want to divide two numbers this is interesting so this is the product of of these two numbers and in order to divide two numbers let's say this is division variable and in order to divide these two numbers you just use forward slash right and let's take two simple numbers first of all for example um 8 and two and I will just build and run this program and it will ideally give give us four because 8 / 2 is 4 right so it gives us four as expected but whenever for example I have nine and I want to divide it by two and by the way this is uh integer values so let's change it to float if uh 9 ID by 2 is 4.5 so that's why we will save it in float variable compile and run the program and it will give us the value let's see what value it gives us first of all and it gives us zero because we haven't change this thing modulus F and compile and run the program in my computer I don't know why it takes a little bit time to compile this program and it gives us four which is not expected because uh 9/ by 2 is 4.5 but what this forward slash symbol do is it will give you the whole division for example uh 9 / by 2 is first of all you will divide 9 by two then you will give four and it will leave the point value so0 five it leave Always by using this you will always get the multiples so four or whenever you have 11 it will give you five and the remainder it will not give you okay and in order to get the remainer so 11 / 2 is 5.5 and the when you divide by uh divide 11 by two it'll you know fully div divided by five and it will give the remainder of one right so in order to get the remainder you use this modulus uh operator and let's change it to modulus modulus and modulus and try to run the program and it g it will give one okay so this modulus always gives you the remainder and this division always give you uh the whole multiple values so one and when you use this it will give you five because it will always skip division always skip the remainder and remainder only shows the remainder and nothing else so in this way you can do simple math in C there are other operators in C also which I will show you in the further videos but these are the simple math op operators which are called multiplicative and additive operators and c and you can do math with these operators and one more thing if you uh want to know what is the Precedence of these operators if you uh have seen in uh your schooling you have something like PD Moss or um something like MD as something right and P stands for parenthesis right so parenthesis it has the main priority then multiplication division and then addition and then subtraction
