06:40 - your project and then we will see this
06:42 - kind of windows so the first thing here
06:45 - is we need to give our application name
06:48 - let's say our application name is my
06:51 - application I have just removed the
06:54 - space between my and application and
06:56 - then the company domain name if you
06:59 - don't have any company domain name you
07:02 - can leave everything as default so this
07:05 - code bind is my max user name that's why
07:10 - here code by not example.com is written
07:13 - okay so whatever your user name will be
