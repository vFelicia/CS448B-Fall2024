00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you the math operations in PHP so
00:05 - there are basically four math operation
00:08 - uh basic math operation you can perform
00:11 - with PHP which is addition subtraction
00:14 - multiplication and division and for
00:17 - example I have two
00:19 - numbers first is a new number
00:25 - one number one and which is equal to to
00:30 - some value so for example
00:35 - 1,9 and I have the same number uh not
00:39 - the same number but other variable
00:41 - called number two which has a value
00:45 - 2,003 for example and I want
00:49 - to use these two variables to add
00:53 - subtract and multiply and divide I can
00:56 - do this easily by my Echo and if you
01:01 - remember whenever you have
01:05 - your uh variable as number or numerical
01:09 - value you don't need these single Cotes
01:13 - to display using Echo so you can just
01:17 - use uh this like this so number
01:22 - one plus number two for addition right
01:29 - and if you want you can show some
01:32 - message here but I'm not going to do
01:35 - that for now or you what you can do here
01:39 - is you can just print
01:45 - out
01:46 - add right and in the same way I can
01:51 - subtract and multiply and divide for
01:55 - example so I can
01:58 - say
02:01 - subtract
02:02 - and this is a subtract in PHP and for
02:07 - the
02:09 - product product you need to have you
02:13 - cannot use this x symbol like this to
02:16 - multiply these two numbers you need to
02:18 - use this estx symbol or this star symbol
02:23 - to multip multiply these two numbers and
02:27 - to
02:28 - divide divide you can just use this
02:33 - slash symbol so these are the basic for
02:36 - arithmetic operators in PHP by which you
02:41 - can do your arithmetic equation or
02:45 - operations so when I save this and I'll
02:48 - go to my math. PHP which I have created
02:52 - for this
02:54 - tutorial and it's saying some notice
02:58 - let's see what is the problem here
03:02 - here yeah so problem is I haven't
03:05 - included this and symbol to any of my
03:08 - variable I should have used so don't
03:11 - forget to use this always
03:16 - right okay I'll just save it and run it
03:22 - and hopefully it will give me the answer
03:25 - but it's just jumbled up because maybe I
03:29 - can use this Break Tag to show these uh
03:35 - answers in different lines BR R right
03:39 - and here also I can use this uh
03:42 - concatenation operator to break right
03:47 - like
03:49 - this okay so just use this break to
03:54 - change the
03:56 - line and in here also just break
04:00 - between these
04:02 - numbers to change the line once again I
04:05 - will just refresh my program and you see
04:10 - addition of these two
04:12 - numbers
04:14 - is you can count it I mean
04:18 - it's
04:20 - 3,12 which is okay the subtraction is -
04:24 - 994 which is also okay the product is
04:27 - this one and the division is this one
04:30 - so these are the four basic arithmetic
04:33 - operation you can perform in
04:35 - PHP and yeah that's it for this video
04:40 - please rate comment and subscribe and
04:41 - bye for now

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you the math operations in PHP so there are basically four math operation uh basic math operation you can perform with PHP which is addition subtraction multiplication and division and for example I have two numbers first is a new number one number one and which is equal to to some value so for example 1,9 and I have the same number uh not the same number but other variable called number two which has a value 2,003 for example and I want to use these two variables to add subtract and multiply and divide I can do this easily by my Echo and if you remember whenever you have your uh variable as number or numerical value you don't need these single Cotes to display using Echo so you can just use uh this like this so number one plus number two for addition right and if you want you can show some message here but I'm not going to do that for now or you what you can do here is you can just print out add right and in the same way I can subtract and multiply and divide for example so I can say subtract and this is a subtract in PHP and for the product product you need to have you cannot use this x symbol like this to multiply these two numbers you need to use this estx symbol or this star symbol to multip multiply these two numbers and to divide divide you can just use this slash symbol so these are the basic for arithmetic operators in PHP by which you can do your arithmetic equation or operations so when I save this and I'll go to my math. PHP which I have created for this tutorial and it's saying some notice let's see what is the problem here here yeah so problem is I haven't included this and symbol to any of my variable I should have used so don't forget to use this always right okay I'll just save it and run it and hopefully it will give me the answer but it's just jumbled up because maybe I can use this Break Tag to show these uh answers in different lines BR R right and here also I can use this uh concatenation operator to break right like this okay so just use this break to change the line and in here also just break between these numbers to change the line once again I will just refresh my program and you see addition of these two numbers is you can count it I mean it's 3,12 which is okay the subtraction is 994 which is also okay the product is this one and the division is this one so these are the four basic arithmetic operation you can perform in PHP and yeah that's it for this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
