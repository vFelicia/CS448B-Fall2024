00:00 - hey everyone today we're gonna talk
00:02 - about canvas widget in painter it's
00:05 - going to be very easy and simple we will
00:07 - just see some functions provided by the
00:09 - class
00:10 - canvas is basically used to draw crafts
00:13 - and charts to get text or images on the
00:18 - window we will see drawings in simple
00:21 - figures on the canvas let's start with
00:23 - it
00:24 - so from winter
00:27 - import Star
00:30 - that's a very convenient way then I'll
00:33 - have my window I'll write when equals TK
00:38 - and I'll also given a title I'll write
00:40 - win dot title
00:43 - that the title be canvas
00:49 - okay then I'll add my widget so my
00:52 - widget would be canvas I'll write canvas
00:54 - equals canvas
00:57 - and where do I want my canvas I want it
01:00 - on my windows so I'll write win for
01:02 - master so basically canvas is a
01:04 - rectangular area where you can draw okay
01:07 - so you have the height and width for
01:10 - canvas I'll give in the width
01:13 - to be 500 and height
01:17 - v500
01:21 - I'll also given a background color Let
01:23 - It Be
01:25 - equals
01:26 - sky blue
01:29 - you can also have a cursor for it so let
01:33 - the cursor type be
01:35 - dot box
01:36 - you can give an arrow circle clock cross
01:40 - exchange heart
01:42 - as a cursor type there are a lot of
01:45 - cursors in Victor
01:47 - so you can see how many arguments you
01:51 - can given for canvas you can have water
01:53 - water width
01:56 - background
01:58 - highlight color insert border with
02:02 - Etc so
02:04 - I'll just given these parameters and
02:08 - then I'll pack this visit I'll write
02:11 - canvas dot back
02:13 - then I'll get on to creating the
02:16 - figures so first of all I'll write
02:19 - canvas
02:21 - dot create Arc
02:24 - I'll give in the X1 y1 and X2 Y2
02:27 - coordinates
02:29 - so that's basically the starting running
02:31 - position
02:32 - so I'll write 5 comma 10
02:35 - and 100 comma 100.
02:39 - then I'll also create a line a simple
02:42 - line that is parallel to the x-axis I'll
02:44 - write
02:46 - canvas dot create line
02:50 - now given the starting and ending
02:52 - position
02:53 - 0 comma 80
02:55 - and 500 comma 80.
02:58 - so you do not need to specify the X1 y1
03:03 - pair and X2 Y2 pair separately painter
03:06 - knows how to pick the coordinates if
03:08 - they are given in the correct order
03:11 - similarly to draw an ellipse or an oval
03:15 - I'll write canvas Dot
03:18 - create oval
03:20 - and I'll given the top left and bottom
03:23 - right coordinates of the rectangle in
03:25 - which the oval would be contained so
03:27 - I'll given 200 comma 200
03:31 - and 400 comma 400.
03:34 - fine
03:35 - then you can also give it a text so let
03:39 - me use this as the heading for the
03:42 - canvas I'll write canvas dot create text
03:46 - the starting position would be 250 comma
03:48 - 10 and the text Let It Be
03:52 - using
03:56 - core
03:57 - you can also given bitmaps you can also
04:00 - draw bitmaps so
04:02 - I'll write canvas dot create bitmap
04:06 - and let the coordinate let the location
04:09 - for the bitmap be 210 comma 50.
04:12 - and bitmap equals Quest head
04:17 - so you have a lot of kind of bitmaps you
04:19 - can take error gray 75 R class info
04:23 - warning question
04:25 - I have taken Quest Health
04:27 - then uh you can also try creating a
04:30 - polygon so I'll write canvas dot create
04:32 - polygon
04:35 - to create a polygon you would need the
04:37 - corner coordinates
04:39 - of the polygon so I'll make a list for
04:42 - that I'll write points equals
04:46 - I'll make a list so I'll try to make a
04:49 - hexagon so let the coordinates be
04:52 - hundred come a hundred
04:54 - 120 comma 100
04:57 - 140 comma 120
04:59 - 120 comma 140
05:02 - 100 comma 140
05:04 - 80 comma 120
05:07 - so there are six pairs
05:09 - and 12 points okay
05:12 - so for the argument of create polygon
05:15 - I'll write points
05:17 - and I'll fill with color
05:19 - pink
05:21 - so that's all I'd be drawing for right
05:23 - now I'll call in the main Loop I'll
05:25 - write when dot main Loop
05:28 - so let's run this and check our canvas
05:35 - so as I run this you can see that the
05:38 - screen is off a specified size that is
05:40 - 500 comma 500 the canvas size and if you
05:43 - expand it you can see that the canvas
05:47 - is not extended okay
05:49 - let's do a specified size you can see
05:52 - the arc you can see the bitmap you can
05:55 - see the line you can see the hexagon you
05:58 - can see the oval
05:59 - so the oval turned out to be a circle
06:01 - because the coordinates that we gave in
06:03 - were 200 comma 200 and 400 comma 400
06:06 - there are the coordinates of a square
06:10 - not a problem and uh
06:13 - you can also notice the kind of Arrow we
06:16 - have within the canvas outside the
06:19 - canvas it's just a normal Arrow
06:21 - but inside it it's a DOT box
06:32 - so that's it about drawing on a canvas
06:34 - you can make a real canvas like a paint
06:36 - app using canvas by tanker but it
06:39 - requires events so since we are not
06:42 - still done with events in Winter we will
06:45 - do that later
06:46 - you can check out how to get images on a
06:49 - canvas try to do that and also try to
06:52 - make some complex shapes on the canvas I
06:55 - hope you will be able to do that thank
06:57 - you
