00:00 - so hello guys welcome back to the
00:01 - another video of the Java tutorial
00:03 - Series so today we are we'll be
00:04 - discussing about while Loops in Java so
00:08 - what are the while Loops while loop is
00:09 - used to iterate a part of the program
00:11 - repeatedly until the specified Boolean
00:14 - condition is true so as soon as the
00:16 - Boolean condition becomes false the loop
00:18 - get automatically stops okay and it is
00:21 - recommended that to use the while loop
00:24 - when we don't know how much iteration we
00:26 - are going to perform in that Loop okay
00:28 - so here you can see the syntax of the
00:31 - while loop while this while is a keyword
00:33 - which is used and the condition is
00:35 - specified inside this circular brackets
00:37 - and inside those uh
00:40 - uh curly braces we will write the code
00:43 - which is which we have to execute inside
00:46 - the while loop okay and after that
00:48 - incrementing decrementing statement
00:50 - should be written so that each time the
00:52 - condition should be checked okay
00:56 - so now this is the flow of while loop so
01:00 - first uh program execution comes and
01:02 - condition is checked whether if the
01:04 - condition is false Loop gets terminated
01:06 - and if the condition is true then
01:08 - statement inside the loop gets executed
01:10 - and again it goes further checking the
01:13 - condition and this Loops will iterate uh
01:16 - time n number of times that we have
01:18 - declared okay
01:20 - so let me just get into my IDE and we
01:25 - can check how while loop is working okay
01:28 - so here I will create another Java class
01:32 - which is name
01:33 - as while loops
01:37 - sorry
01:38 - okay let me increase the font size
01:43 - I will get my main method
01:45 - and
01:46 - okay so first exam first I will take
01:49 - simple example okay so integer let me
01:52 - take integer I is equals to 1
01:55 - and then while while is the keyword
01:59 - which I will use and inside circular
02:01 - braces I will tell the condition that my
02:04 - ash is less than equals to 10. okay
02:08 - and inside loop uh I will be printing
02:11 - the value of I
02:13 - okay simply and after that I will be
02:17 - incrementing the my value of the I okay
02:20 - so this is the simple while loop where
02:23 - we are checking the whether ice value is
02:25 - less than equals to 10 or not if that
02:27 - value is less than equals to 10 that
02:29 - Loops uh this expression get evaluated
02:32 - at evaluated as true and Loops get
02:35 - executed and system dot out dot println
02:38 - will print the value of I on the console
02:40 - and each time the value of I will be
02:43 - incremented so for the first time when
02:46 - Loop expression gets checked the value
02:48 - of I is 1 here you can see okay so one
02:51 - is less than 10 yes it will come inside
02:53 - the loop and it will print the value of
02:55 - I that is 1 and it will after that it
02:58 - will increment the value of I by 1 so
03:00 - when next time the loop get when the
03:03 - expression get checked the value of I is
03:05 - 2 2 is less than 10 yes the it comes out
03:09 - inside the loop and it will print the
03:11 - value of I that is C equals to 2 so day
03:14 - it will print all this value of I well
03:17 - until the expression it this expression
03:19 - evaluated as true so let me just run
03:22 - this code
03:25 - so that we can get the output so here we
03:27 - can see one two three four five six
03:30 - seven eight nine ten is going to print
03:32 - it and after that Loop is terminated
03:35 - because the value of when after 10 the
03:37 - value of I becomes 11 and 11 is not less
03:40 - than 10 and this expression is evaluated
03:42 - as false and it will terminate the loop
03:45 - okay
03:45 - so let me just comment out this and I
03:49 - will tell you another example which is
03:52 - known as infinite Loop okay
03:54 - so
03:56 - I will declare one while loop and inside
03:59 - that I will write on simply true okay
04:02 - and I will just print
04:06 - in
04:08 - five native
04:12 - Loop
04:14 - okay
04:16 - so here you can see this while loop will
04:20 - never execute a naval terminate because
04:22 - why because the expression inside this
04:25 - tells that it is always true that will
04:27 - that because when when I click on run
04:31 - so here you can see infinite infinitive
04:34 - infinity loop is getting printed on the
04:36 - screen so to exit from this you just
04:40 - have to press Ctrl C so that your code
04:45 - will be get
04:46 - stopped executing and this look at here
04:50 - how many times it is printing in finite
04:52 - in finite Loops okay
04:54 - so this is one example of the infinite
04:56 - Loops in Java so you have to avoid this
05:00 - okay this kind of situation when you are
05:02 - coding so that that is pretty much about
05:05 - while Loops so enough upcoming videos
05:07 - we'll be talking about do while Loops so
05:09 - thank you guys for watching this video
05:10 - and I will see you in the next one

so hello guys welcome back to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we are we'll be discussing about while Loops in Java so what are the while Loops while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true so as soon as the Boolean condition becomes false the loop get automatically stops okay and it is recommended that to use the while loop when we don't know how much iteration we are going to perform in that Loop okay so here you can see the syntax of the while loop while this while is a keyword which is used and the condition is specified inside this circular brackets and inside those uh uh curly braces we will write the code which is which we have to execute inside the while loop okay and after that incrementing decrementing statement should be written so that each time the condition should be checked okay so now this is the flow of while loop so first uh program execution comes and condition is checked whether if the condition is false Loop gets terminated and if the condition is true then statement inside the loop gets executed and again it goes further checking the condition and this Loops will iterate uh time n number of times that we have declared okay so let me just get into my IDE and we can check how while loop is working okay so here I will create another Java class which is name as while loops sorry okay let me increase the font size I will get my main method and okay so first exam first I will take simple example okay so integer let me take integer I is equals to 1 and then while while is the keyword which I will use and inside circular braces I will tell the condition that my ash is less than equals to 10. okay and inside loop uh I will be printing the value of I okay simply and after that I will be incrementing the my value of the I okay so this is the simple while loop where we are checking the whether ice value is less than equals to 10 or not if that value is less than equals to 10 that Loops uh this expression get evaluated at evaluated as true and Loops get executed and system dot out dot println will print the value of I on the console and each time the value of I will be incremented so for the first time when Loop expression gets checked the value of I is 1 here you can see okay so one is less than 10 yes it will come inside the loop and it will print the value of I that is 1 and it will after that it will increment the value of I by 1 so when next time the loop get when the expression get checked the value of I is 2 2 is less than 10 yes the it comes out inside the loop and it will print the value of I that is C equals to 2 so day it will print all this value of I well until the expression it this expression evaluated as true so let me just run this code so that we can get the output so here we can see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten is going to print it and after that Loop is terminated because the value of when after 10 the value of I becomes 11 and 11 is not less than 10 and this expression is evaluated as false and it will terminate the loop okay so let me just comment out this and I will tell you another example which is known as infinite Loop okay so I will declare one while loop and inside that I will write on simply true okay and I will just print in five native Loop okay so here you can see this while loop will never execute a naval terminate because why because the expression inside this tells that it is always true that will that because when when I click on run so here you can see infinite infinitive infinity loop is getting printed on the screen so to exit from this you just have to press Ctrl C so that your code will be get stopped executing and this look at here how many times it is printing in finite in finite Loops okay so this is one example of the infinite Loops in Java so you have to avoid this okay this kind of situation when you are coding so that that is pretty much about while Loops so enough upcoming videos we'll be talking about do while Loops so thank you guys for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
