00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:03 - this tutorial we will design the layout
00:06 - for login activity so for that first
00:09 - I'll open my register activity and I
00:13 - will copy all the code and paste it in
00:17 - my login activity and over here I will
00:21 - just remove a few things I'll remove
00:25 - this username and name added text as I
00:30 - don't need them and I'll change the text
00:35 - from register to login the ID from
00:42 - register to login and this text from
00:46 - already a user login to new to instagram
00:58 - register and then i'll change the ID to
01:03 - registered user okay now i will go to my
01:09 - login activity and over there i will
01:11 - create the variables as my data members
01:14 - shall write private edit text email
01:22 - private edit text password and i will
01:29 - also create a firebase or variable soil
01:31 - right private firebase earth m earth
01:40 - and I'll also create a button
01:45 - [Music]
01:50 - then I'll create the textview private
01:55 - text view with adjusted user now I
02:01 - linked these data members to my XML
02:04 - components so for that in my on create
02:06 - method I'll write email is equal to find
02:10 - view by ID r dot ID dot email and for
02:16 - password password is equal to find view
02:19 - by ID ID ID dot password for login
02:25 - highlight login is equal to find view by
02:29 - ID r dot ID dot login and for register
02:35 - user I'll write find view by ID r dot IO
02:40 - dot register user and then I'll
02:43 - initialize my Emeth variable so I'll
02:47 - write em auth is equal to firebase or
02:50 - that get instance now I'll add an
02:54 - onclicklistener to my register user text
02:56 - so I'll write register user dot set
02:59 - onclicklistener
03:01 - new onclicklistener and then over here
03:05 - I'll start an activity alert start
03:07 - activity new intent login activity dot
03:16 - this to register activity dot class and
03:24 - then I'll add a flag I will write add
03:27 - flags clear tasks
03:34 - okay now I'll add an onclicklistener to
03:38 - my login button so for that I will write
03:39 - login dot set onclicklistener new
03:44 - onclicklistener
03:46 - and over here I'll check if the all the
03:50 - edit texts have some value so for that
03:53 - I'll extract the values from the edit
03:57 - text so for that I will write string
04:00 - text email is equal to email that is our
04:04 - edit text dot text dot to string and
04:09 - then I'll write string text password is
04:16 - equal to password that is our edit text
04:19 - dot to get text dot to string now I will
04:23 - check if the they have some value so for
04:25 - that I will write
04:26 - if XTO tells dot is empty text email or
04:35 - text you tells dot is empty text
04:41 - password then I will display our toast
04:48 - telling em empty credentials
04:56 - else
05:02 - yes I will call a method called login
05:07 - user and to that I'll send my email and
05:12 - password
05:21 - now I'll create the method over here
05:25 - I'll create it in my login activity and
05:29 - I'll change this text password to only
05:34 - password and text email to only me and
05:38 - over here I'll write M auth dot sign-in
05:43 - with email and password and the first
05:46 - parameter will be email and the second
05:48 - parameter will be password and I'll add
05:51 - an on complete listener so I'll check if
05:59 - my task is successful if task dot is
06:04 - successful then I'll just copy the code
06:07 - from my register activity so if the task
06:13 - is successful we display our toast and
06:16 - then start our main activity I'll do the
06:18 - same over here I'll paste it over here
06:23 - and I'll change this activity from the
06:26 - sister activity to login activity and
06:30 - over here also from the sister activity
06:33 - to login activity and if the task is not
06:40 - successful so for that I'll add a non
06:42 - failure listener so if the task has
06:49 - failed we display our toast with the
06:52 - actual error over here I will write Ile
06:56 - dot get a message okay so this code
07:03 - should work okay so it is having some
07:09 - error yes I forgot to give the semicolon
07:12 - over here okay so now let's try running
07:15 - this app
07:20 - so once tap has started running if I
07:23 - click on login and then I enter my email
07:26 - and password the same email that I have
07:30 - used to create an account earlier
07:33 - password is one two three four five six
07:36 - and then I if I click on login
07:40 - I am redirected to the main activity
07:44 - that means my login is successful and
07:46 - now that we have both registered
07:48 - activity and login activity we don't
07:51 - want to login every time we build our
07:55 - app so for that I will go to my start
07:56 - activity and over here I override my on
08:01 - start method and inside that I will
08:06 - write an if condition if firebase auth
08:10 - dot get instance dot that current user
08:14 - is not equal to null then it will it
08:20 - should redirect to directly to the main
08:23 - activity so for that I will create an
08:26 - intent or I will make it as an inline
08:32 - function I will write start activity new
08:36 - intent start activity dot this comma
08:43 - main activity dot class and after this I
08:49 - will add up finish okay so now if we run
08:55 - the app and the user is already logged
08:57 - in then we should directly be redirected
08:59 - to our main activity so let's check it
09:05 - okay so you can see as the app starts we
09:08 - are directly in our main activity so
09:13 - this is how we create the login page for
09:17 - for an application I hope everything was
09:20 - clear thank you
