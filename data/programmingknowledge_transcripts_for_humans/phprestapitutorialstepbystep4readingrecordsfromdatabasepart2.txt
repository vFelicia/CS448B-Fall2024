00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part four of our PHP
00:06 - REST API tutorial and in this video
00:10 - we're going to continue working on with
00:12 - our project specifically our read that
00:15 - PHP file so let's open up our PHP tag in
00:20 - here and since it is a PHP REST API
00:24 - we're going to allow HTTP request here
00:27 - so we're going to add headers here
00:31 - so that will be header and then inside
00:36 - we need to define access control and
00:40 - then allow region and then colon and
00:47 - then of course the asterisk which means
00:50 - we're just allowing anyone without the
00:52 - problem with authentication or oath or
00:55 - something like that and then also we
00:58 - need to specify the content type here so
01:03 - that's content content and then type
01:07 - colon so this will be the mime type is
01:11 - application slash JSON format okay so in
01:16 - here we need to include the initialize
01:21 - PHP file so that's our read that PHP
01:27 - file is inside the API directory so we
01:29 - need to back or up one directory so
01:33 - that's period period in the n slash and
01:37 - of course our initialize core and then
01:42 - initialize that PHP so what we're doing
01:47 - is that we're just calling the
01:49 - initialize that PHP file which contains
01:50 - all the constant that we have defined
01:54 - the directory separate or the site root
01:56 - the include path in the core path and of
01:59 - course it will load the config file so
02:03 - which is our database connection so we
02:06 - already have the DB connection here so
02:09 - we can just use it in our read that PHP
02:13 - file so this is initializing initialized
02:18 - seeing our API so as i've said this
02:22 - include the config of our database the
02:25 - connection and also all the files that
02:28 - we have initialized in our initialize
02:31 - that PHP so say for example the post we
02:34 - require once the post dot PHP file which
02:39 - is the class post that includes all the
02:42 - necessary properties for this particular
02:46 - class so in here we need to instantiate
02:54 - the post class so that will be
02:59 - instantiated post so will be post and
03:05 - then new post and then of course because
03:08 - we specify that our construct function
03:12 - takes in a DB connection so that will be
03:17 - post equals new post and then of course
03:19 - our DB connection so if you're wondering
03:24 - where is this DB connection or this DB
03:26 - variable it is in our config that PHP
03:30 - file so as you can see here we have
03:32 - defined a DB or the deep database
03:35 - connection so next is to query the
03:39 - actual blog post so blog post theory so
03:46 - we're going to do that by using the post
03:49 - object and then by using the read
03:54 - function so the read function we have
03:59 - defined it in our post that PHP file
04:03 - which is our class post so read and then
04:08 - of course we're going to get the row
04:11 - count so that will be num and then
04:16 - result and then row count and we're
04:23 - going to check if num is greater than Z
04:27 - so that will be posed post array or yeah
04:37 - re and then we're just going to
04:40 - initialize it as an empty array so post
04:44 - our and then we're going to have this
04:49 - data equals array okay and then we're
04:55 - just going to add the else statement
04:58 - here and in here we're just going to
05:01 - iterate the row equals the result and
05:08 - then we're going to fetch the PDO
05:12 - associative array so fetch a sock and
05:19 - then curly braces and then we're just
05:23 - going to say here extra the row okay
05:30 - so here we're going to say post item
05:36 - equals array and then inside this
05:41 - particular array we're going to define
05:43 - the attributes that we want to return
05:45 - for this particular post so ID and then
05:49 - the title of our post so tie a tail okay
05:57 - and then body of a post also so each
06:04 - time entity called the body per post and
06:10 - then of course the author of the post
06:17 - okay
06:18 - offer and also the category ID okay so
06:29 - category ID and last one will be the
06:36 - category name so category underscore
06:39 - name
06:40 - in Category underscore name and of
06:48 - course after that one we yeah we have
06:52 - instead of using the comma we use the
06:55 - semicolon so there you go
07:00 - so in here after the iteration or before
07:05 - the iteration closest you need to push
07:10 - the data into our array so re push the
07:17 - array which is post array and then beta
07:23 - and of course we're going to push the
07:26 - post item and then after that one after
07:32 - the iteration of the records were just
07:35 - going to push blue data
07:42 - okay so or I mean we're trying to
07:46 - convert convert to JSON and then output
07:58 - so echo and then we're going to use d
08:05 - PHP function JSON underscore encode and
08:10 - our post array there you go and if the
08:18 - number or the number of count or the
08:21 - number of result is less than zero so we
08:26 - just need also to define a message here
08:29 - so that will be echo and then JSON
08:35 - encode encode and message is we just set
08:47 - this to
08:48 - no holes fountain okay echo Jason and we
08:57 - need to add semicolon at the end of the
09:01 - line coach's son of course we need also
09:06 - to define that it should be inside the
09:09 - array okay so there you go
09:15 - and in this part right here we're going
09:18 - to create our database and other tables
09:21 - and of course the records that we're
09:24 - going to read from our API so let's go
09:28 - to our PHP myadmin and in here that's
09:31 - just great a new database well that will
09:35 - be PHP rest okay as you can remember
09:38 - that's the name of our database that we
09:41 - have defined in our config dot PHP file
09:43 - and also we're going to add here a table
09:47 - or a couple of table here so categories
09:50 - and there will be three columns or three
09:56 - attributes for this particular table so
09:59 - that will be ID and the length is eleven
10:03 - auto-increment and there there will be
10:08 - name and for car which has 255 is length
10:15 - and create a dot and this should be a
10:19 - date time or is a date time and yeah I
10:28 - think that's it and then save so we have
10:33 - now a table categories and also we need
10:35 - to add a post table so that will be post
10:40 - and id land is eleven auto-increment
10:47 - and of course we have the category ID so
10:53 - this will be int 11 and then we have
10:57 - title
10:58 - so virtual
11:01 - 2:55 and the body also will be Tech's
11:08 - then we add two more for our author or
11:16 - author of our post which will be bar
11:19 - chart 255 also and of course the created
11:24 - ad created ad and this will be a daytime
11:30 - daytime there you go and then save so we
11:34 - now have two tables in our database so
11:38 - in categories we need to insert some
11:42 - values here so the first one will be
11:47 - technology and then created and then
11:53 - created ad will be the date today so
11:56 - that will be 31 and the hour is 10 ok so
12:07 - the second one will be gaming and the
12:13 - date the same and the hour is stem ok so
12:21 - go and let's just an add another
12:27 - categories of our post or auto and then
12:31 - the date if you want I can place or I
12:38 - can add the database in the description
12:42 - you can just download it and import it
12:46 - in your PHP myadmin so it will save you
12:51 - a lot of time instead of making all this
12:54 - unnecessary part of creating the
12:58 - database ok so you always have the
13:03 - option to download the database coming
13:06 - from the description of this particular
13:08 - video so in the next video we are going
13:11 - to continue working on with our project
13:14 - and also insert some data in here for
13:19 - our posts tables so see you in the next
13:21 - video
13:22 - Thanks
