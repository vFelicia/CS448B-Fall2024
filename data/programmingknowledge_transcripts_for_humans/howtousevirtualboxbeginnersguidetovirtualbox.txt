00:00 - so those of you who don't know what
00:02 - VirtualBox is VirtualBox is a tool which
00:06 - will enable you to run different
00:08 - operating systems virtually on your host
00:12 - operating system so in this case my host
00:15 - operating system is Windows 10 and I
00:18 - have installed VirtualBox on my Windows
00:21 - 10 and then this VirtualBox will enable
00:24 - me to run different operating systems
00:27 - virtually on my Windows 10 operating
00:30 - system so Oracle VirtualBox is a free
00:33 - and open source host hypervisor for
00:37 - virtualization in other words VirtualBox
00:40 - allows you to install many operating
00:44 - systems virtually on your host operating
00:47 - system so let's say I want to install
00:50 - Ubuntu operating system virtually on my
00:53 - Windows operating system I can do that
00:56 - using VirtualBox so for installing
00:59 - VirtualBox just open your favorite
01:00 - browser and search for VirtualBox and
01:03 - the first link which will appear here
01:05 - will be from virtualbox.org G so we are
01:08 - going to just click on this link so once
01:11 - this website opens if you are not
01:13 - directly redirected to the downloads
01:16 - page you can click on this Downloads
01:18 - link and you will be able to see this
01:21 - kind of Downloads interface we want to
01:25 - download the VirtualBox for Windows so
01:28 - we are going to select windows host and
01:30 - once you click on that link you can see
01:34 - the download of this VirtualBox exe has
01:37 - been started which is around 1 0 8
01:40 - megabyte so once this executable file is
01:43 - downloaded I'm going to just click on
01:45 - this executable file and I'm going to
01:48 - just minimize the browser the first
01:51 - window looks like this so I'm going to
01:53 - just click on the next button here and
01:56 - this is the location where your
01:58 - VirtualBox will be installed so if you
02:01 - don't have the good reason to change
02:02 - this part just go ahead and click Next
02:05 - and just leave everything as default
02:09 - click Next and then click yes and then
02:12 - click install
02:14 - we're just going to start the process of
02:15 - installing the VirtualBox on your
02:17 - Windows operating system in between you
02:19 - will see these kind of messages which
02:21 - will ask you to install some device
02:24 - related software so I'm going to just
02:26 - click on install and then you can see a
02:32 - straightaway here this Oracle VirtualBox
02:35 - icon is created and after some time you
02:38 - will also see this message which says
02:40 - the installation of VirtualBox is
02:43 - complete and just leave this checkbox
02:46 - checked which is going to launch your
02:49 - VirtualBox after you close that window
02:52 - so this is how VirtualBox looks like you
02:56 - can close it and I'm going to once again
02:58 - open it using this icon so on VirtualBox
03:02 - you can create any virtual machine by
03:05 - just clicking on this new button here
03:07 - and you can see there are a different
03:10 - type of virtual machine you can create
03:13 - for example Windows Linux Solaris BSD
03:17 - IBM Mac OS and other so let's say I want
03:20 - to just install Ubuntu I will just type
03:23 - open to here and you can see this type
03:28 - is Linux and from here you can choose
03:30 - the version of Ubuntu you want to
03:32 - install so you can choose 32-bit or
03:34 - 64-bit and then go to the next step and
03:39 - then you can choose the other options
03:43 - like memory and the processors and other
03:47 - things right the most important thing
03:50 - you need to have or to install a virtual
03:52 - machine on your host operating system is
03:56 - the ISO file so you can download for
04:01 - example the Ubuntu desktop I also file
04:04 - from the Ubuntu website and then you can
04:08 - just use that ISO file to create open to
04:13 - virtual machine which will allow you to
04:15 - create open to virtual machine and work
04:18 - with Ubuntu on your Windows operating
04:20 - system how you can download and install
04:22 - Ubuntu 20 point zero 4 on your
04:26 - VirtualBox
04:27 - in your Windows 10 operating system so
04:30 - once you have installed VirtualBox on
04:33 - your Windows operating system it's going
04:35 - to look like this and whenever you open
04:38 - VirtualBox it's going to open Oracle VM
04:42 - VirtualBox manager now we are going to
04:45 - download the ISO file which is required
04:48 - to install Ubuntu on our VirtualBox
04:53 - so for downloading the ISO file of
04:56 - Ubuntu you can just search for Ubuntu
04:59 - and the first link which will appear
05:01 - here will be from Ubuntu calm so I'm
05:03 - going to just click on this link and
05:05 - straight away you will see this option
05:09 - here it says what's new in open to 2004
05:13 - because 2004 is the latest version of
05:18 - Ubuntu which is released recently so
05:21 - here you will see our downloads tab here
05:25 - and when you click on the download tab
05:28 - you will see the Ubuntu desktop so you
05:31 - can just click on the version which is
05:34 - available and most probably you might
05:37 - want to install the LTS version okay so
05:41 - make sure that whenever you install
05:43 - Ubuntu you install the LTS version LTS
05:47 - means the long-term support version
05:49 - which will at least run for two years
05:52 - okay so the support will run for two
05:55 - years so I'm going to just click on open
05:58 - to desktop and here you will see the
06:01 - download button so I'm going to just
06:03 - click on the download button and when
06:05 - you click on the download button the ISO
06:07 - file will be downloaded on your Windows
06:11 - operating system so this file is around
06:13 - 2.5 GB file so it will take some time to
06:16 - download but I have already downloaded
06:18 - this file on my Windows operating system
06:21 - so I'm going to just cancel this
06:22 - download and also if you want to support
06:26 - open to project then you can just give
06:30 - small donation to open - for now I don't
06:33 - want to do anything so I have just
06:35 - downloaded the ISO file so once you have
06:38 - downloaded the ISO file it's going to
06:40 - look like this
06:41 - in case you have downloaded the 2004
06:44 - version of Ubuntu so the name is open to
06:48 - - 2004 - desktop
06:52 - - AMD 64 dot ISO file so once you have
06:57 - downloaded this ISO file we are ready to
07:00 - install Ubuntu on our VirtualBox
07:02 - so on your VirtualBox you just need to
07:05 - click on the new button here and once
07:09 - you click on the new button here you can
07:11 - provide the name of your new machine so
07:15 - my new machine name is Ubuntu so I'm
07:18 - going to just write open to here and
07:19 - let's say I will also give the version
07:22 - of Ubuntu let's say 20 point 0 4 here
07:26 - and straight away VirtualBox is smart
07:30 - enough to provide you the proper options
07:32 - here ok
07:33 - so here you will see the machine folder
07:37 - where all the VirtualBox related files
07:40 - will be downloaded and saved on your
07:44 - Windows operating system and the type
07:47 - here is Linux because open to is a Linux
07:49 - based operating system and the version
07:53 - here is open to 64 bit because we have
07:56 - downloaded the 64-bit ISO file ok there
08:01 - is no other option on the website as far
08:04 - as I know if you want to choose any
08:08 - other operating system the procedure is
08:11 - same you just need to select the
08:14 - operating system you want to install and
08:18 - here you can see many choices are given
08:22 - here ok so type is Linux and the version
08:25 - is open to 64-bit and then click on next
08:28 - and here in the memory size I generally
08:32 - provide the memory up to the green mark
08:35 - so up to here whatever is allowed on my
08:40 - Windows operating system at this point
08:42 - and then I click on next here just leave
08:48 - everything as default so just leave it
08:50 - as default and then click on the create
08:53 - button now here hi
08:55 - desk file type just leave it as VDI
08:58 - which is VirtualBox disk image and then
09:01 - click on next and here also you just
09:05 - need to leave this as dynamically
09:07 - allocated if you want to learn more
09:10 - about what is dynamically allocated and
09:13 - fixed size you can read from here
09:15 - basically dynamically at located option
09:19 - will allow you're open to operating
09:21 - system to expand the disk size if
09:24 - required and fixed size is the fixed
09:27 - size so we want to allocate the space
09:31 - and disk size are dynamically that's why
09:35 - we have chosen this option here which is
09:37 - dynamically allocated and now click on
09:40 - next and on the next window you can
09:42 - choose the file location this will be
09:45 - the location where your Ubuntu operating
09:48 - system files will be downloaded and
09:52 - installed on your Windows operating
09:54 - systems so if you don't have the good
09:56 - reason to change it just leave it as
09:58 - default also you can choose the virtual
10:01 - hard disk size from here by default it's
10:05 - 10 GB selected here but let's say I
10:07 - would just want to increase it to 100 GB
10:12 - so I'm going to just move it around 100
10:15 - GB and then I'm going to just click on
10:17 - create ok so once you create this
10:20 - machine you will be able to see this new
10:24 - machine here which is open to 20 point 0
10:28 - 4 so just select this machine
10:30 - don't press on the start button yet you
10:34 - just need to select this open 2 machine
10:37 - which you have created and then click on
10:39 - the settings option so on the general
10:42 - settings you will see some options which
10:45 - we have already chosen at the time of
10:48 - creating this machine which is Linux and
10:51 - the version is Ubuntu 64-bit now click
10:55 - on advanced settings and then in the
10:57 - shared clipboard option you just need to
11:00 - choose it bi-directional and then drag
11:03 - and drop also bi-directional that will
11:06 - allow you to share your files we
11:09 - between your host machine which is
11:10 - Windows in my case and your virtual
11:14 - machine which will be open to
11:17 - bi-directionally so you will be able to
11:19 - copy and paste into your Ubuntu from
11:22 - your Windows operating system and vice
11:25 - versa
11:25 - ok so in the description you can give
11:28 - any description here and in the disk
11:31 - encryption you just leave it as default
11:34 - now I'm going to just go to the system
11:37 - option here and in the motherboard
11:41 - option you can leave everything as
11:44 - default you just need to go to the
11:47 - processors here and by default
11:49 - VirtualBox will allocate one CPU to your
11:52 - machine so if you have the option you
11:56 - can increase it to whatever CPU one you
12:00 - want to use so for the safer side I
12:03 - always go up to this green mark here ok
12:06 - which is for in my case you can increase
12:09 - the CPU size later also ok
12:12 - in the display settings just leave of
12:14 - everything as default and then move to
12:17 - the storage section here here you need
12:22 - to provide the location of your ISO file
12:24 - wherever you have downloaded your one
12:27 - two iso file so you just need to click
12:29 - on the empty option here so just click
12:32 - on empty under the controller so just
12:34 - choose the CD icon option here and then
12:38 - click on choose our disc file from here
12:40 - ok so just click on choose a disc file
12:42 - from here and then you just need to
12:45 - browse to the location where you have
12:47 - downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so I'm
12:51 - going to just copy the location here and
12:53 - then paste it here and then select the
12:56 - ISO file from here and then click on
12:58 - open so once you have selected your ISO
13:01 - file using this CD icon you will see the
13:04 - name of your ISO file here also let me
13:07 - just move it further you can see the
13:10 - exact name of my ISO file here open to
13:14 - 20 of 0 for desktop MD 64 so once you
13:18 - have done that you can do other settings
13:20 - from here also but I will leave
13:21 - everything as default and click
13:23 - okay and once you have done all those
13:26 - settings you are ready to start your one
13:29 - to installation so here what I'm going
13:31 - to do is I'm going to select Ubuntu 20
13:33 - point zero 4 and click on start button
13:36 - here and you can see the installation of
13:41 - Ubuntu is going to start in a few
13:44 - seconds you can just close these warning
13:48 - signs here and now you will see this
13:51 - kind of window here so on the left hand
13:53 - side you can choose the language in
13:56 - which you want to install ubuntu you can
13:58 - see many languages are given here but
14:02 - for now I will choose English as my
14:06 - language and then I will click on the
14:08 - install Ubuntu a button here now in the
14:13 - next window you will see the keyboard
14:15 - layout so from here you can choose the
14:17 - keyboard layout whatever keyboard layout
14:20 - you are using on your laptop or on your
14:23 - keyboard so in my case I'm using a
14:27 - German keyboard so I can just move to
14:30 - the German keyboard option here so I'm
14:33 - going to just search for the German
14:35 - keyboard which is this one you can
14:37 - choose any other keyboard from here ok
14:40 - so I'm going to choose the German
14:41 - keyboard and then on the right hand side
14:45 - I will just choose German as the
14:48 - language here and then you can also test
14:52 - your keyboard by typing something in
14:54 - this box so just choose your keyboard
14:57 - language here and then click on continue
14:59 - button and here on this window you will
15:04 - see update and other software's so I
15:07 - normally just leave it as normal
15:11 - installation option checked and also I
15:14 - leave this option also checked which is
15:17 - download updates while installing Ubuntu
15:20 - also I'm going to just check this option
15:22 - also which is installed third-party
15:24 - software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware
15:27 - and additional media formats so just
15:30 - check all the options which I have
15:32 - checked and then click on continue and
15:34 - here in the installation type
15:37 - leave this option as default which is
15:40 - erased disk and install Ubuntu so this
15:44 - is not going to erase anything because
15:47 - you are installing Ubuntu on your
15:51 - VirtualBox you are not installing Ubuntu
15:54 - on your hardware right so don't worry
15:59 - it's not going to erase any disk or
16:01 - anything from your Windows operating
16:04 - system just leave it as erase disk and
16:07 - install Ubuntu and then click on install
16:10 - now now here you will see this warning
16:13 - which says if you continue the changes
16:15 - listed below will be written I will just
16:18 - click on continue button here now in the
16:20 - next step you can choose the location
16:21 - which is nearer to your physical
16:25 - location so I have chosen this location
16:29 - which is nearer to my physical location
16:32 - and then I'm going to click on the
16:34 - continue button and here you can just
16:39 - give the name to your Ubuntu operating
16:42 - system for example I'm going to just
16:44 - write code bind here as the name and as
16:48 - the computer name here I can even remove
16:52 - the VirtualBox from the end because I
16:55 - just want to give the same name as the
16:58 - computer name also and also as the user
17:00 - name I will just leave it as code bind
17:04 - if you want to change these names or so
17:08 - let's say you want to give the different
17:10 - user name here you can do that also and
17:13 - then you can just provide the password
17:15 - I'm going to just provide the password
17:17 - for now it's a weak password but you
17:20 - might want to provide the stronger parts
17:23 - for than this and then you just need to
17:26 - confirm this password and once you are
17:30 - done with that you just need to click on
17:33 - the continue button and now the
17:37 - installation of Ubuntu will start on
17:40 - your VirtualBox so now at this step you
17:44 - don't need to do anything until open to
17:47 - is installed on
17:49 - you're VirtualBox so you just need to
17:51 - wait for some time until this
17:53 - installation is finished so I will also
17:56 - wait for the installation to be finished
17:59 - and after some time you will see this
18:04 - kind of window which says installation
18:06 - is complete you need to restart the
18:08 - computer in order to use the new
18:09 - installation so I'm going to just click
18:12 - on the restart Now button and at this
18:18 - point it says please remove the
18:20 - installation medium then press Enter so
18:23 - I'm going to just press ENTER here and
18:25 - now I can see the Ubuntu operating
18:26 - system is starting and now I can see
18:29 - this login window here so if you
18:32 - remember this is the user name which I
18:34 - have given to my Ubuntu operating system
18:36 - so I will just click on this user and
18:39 - then I will provide the password which I
18:41 - have given at the time of installation
18:44 - and then press Enter
18:45 - so first of all you will see this kind
18:47 - of welcome window here you can click on
18:49 - the Skip option here and also you can
18:53 - just click on the next next and next and
18:57 - then click on done and you will be able
19:00 - to see your Ubuntu desktop here right so
19:04 - when you just click on this maximize
19:08 - button now you will see that this
19:10 - desktop is not maximizing so for that we
19:14 - need to install a tool called VirtualBox
19:17 - guest additions so for installing the
19:21 - VirtualBox guest additions what you need
19:24 - to do is you need to open the terminal
19:27 - so you can just click on this option and
19:29 - then search for terminal here and once
19:34 - the terminal result comes you just need
19:36 - to click on the terminal option now once
19:39 - your terminal opens you just need to
19:40 - give this command I'm going to provide
19:43 - this command in the description of this
19:44 - video also which is to install some
19:48 - essential packages before you install
19:50 - VirtualBox guest additions on your open
19:53 - to operating system so this command is
19:55 - sudo apt install built essentials space
19:59 - DKMS space linux -
20:02 - - this you name space are okay so just
20:08 - type this command on the Ubuntu terminal
20:12 - and then press Enter and give your
20:14 - Ubuntu password I'm going to just
20:16 - provide my open to is password here and
20:18 - then I will just press yes here or why
20:21 - here and then press ENTER and after some
20:24 - time you will see that all the
20:27 - installation steps are finished so once
20:30 - it's done you can close your terminal
20:33 - and now what you can do is you can just
20:35 - go to devices on your VirtualBox windows
20:39 - so just click on devices here and then
20:41 - click on insert guest additions CD image
20:44 - and once you do that you will be able to
20:47 - see this kind of window so you just need
20:49 - to click on the Run button here so just
20:51 - click on run and then you just need to
20:55 - provide your open to spaz word so I'm
20:57 - going to just provide my Ubuntu is
21:00 - password and then click on authenticate
21:01 - we're just going to open the terminal
21:04 - and it's going to install the VirtualBox
21:07 - guest additions on your open to
21:11 - operating system and after some time you
21:13 - will see this message which says press
21:15 - return to close this window so you just
21:18 - need to press enter here which is going
21:21 - to close this window now at this point
21:24 - you just need to restart your Ubuntu
21:26 - operating system so just go here at the
21:29 - top and then click on power off and then
21:33 - click on power of once again ok so just
21:36 - click on power off and here you don't
21:38 - need to click on restart you just need
21:41 - to click on power off because we just
21:43 - need to shut down our open to operating
21:45 - system first now once it's shut down as
21:48 - I have told you that in the settings you
21:51 - need to go to the Advanced Settings in
21:54 - the general tab and make sure that this
21:58 - shared clipboard and drag-drop option is
22:01 - bi-directional and that will enable you
22:04 - to just copy and paste your files
22:07 - between the VirtualBox and your host
22:09 - operating system now I'm going to start
22:12 - this open to once again and now I'm
22:14 - going to provide my Ubuntu
22:16 - password again and now if you observe
22:19 - when I just drag this window and make
22:23 - the size of this window a little bit
22:24 - bigger the size of Ubuntu desktop also
22:28 - changes and resolution is also better
22:31 - right so when I just maximize this
22:33 - window my Ubuntu desktop size will also
22:37 - change so this is working now now I just
22:42 - want to test whether the copy and paste
22:45 - feature is working or not so I just
22:48 - opened the Firefox browser on my open to
22:52 - operating system and now I'm going to
22:54 - just copy this URL which is on my
22:57 - windows operating system so this is the
23:00 - Google Chrome browser on my Windows
23:02 - operating system and I will just copy
23:04 - this URL and paste it into my open to
23:07 - operating system and you can see this
23:09 - copy and paste option is working here
23:11 - right so this is working similarly when
23:15 - you just copy let's say I'm going to
23:17 - just copy this text from here and go to
23:19 - the browser and open the next tab and
23:22 - paste this thing here you can see you
23:26 - can paste your text from your open to
23:29 - operating system into your Windows
23:31 - operating system so this is how you can

so those of you who don't know what VirtualBox is VirtualBox is a tool which will enable you to run different operating systems virtually on your host operating system so in this case my host operating system is Windows 10 and I have installed VirtualBox on my Windows 10 and then this VirtualBox will enable me to run different operating systems virtually on my Windows 10 operating system so Oracle VirtualBox is a free and open source host hypervisor for virtualization in other words VirtualBox allows you to install many operating systems virtually on your host operating system so let's say I want to install Ubuntu operating system virtually on my Windows operating system I can do that using VirtualBox so for installing VirtualBox just open your favorite browser and search for VirtualBox and the first link which will appear here will be from virtualbox.org G so we are going to just click on this link so once this website opens if you are not directly redirected to the downloads page you can click on this Downloads link and you will be able to see this kind of Downloads interface we want to download the VirtualBox for Windows so we are going to select windows host and once you click on that link you can see the download of this VirtualBox exe has been started which is around 1 0 8 megabyte so once this executable file is downloaded I'm going to just click on this executable file and I'm going to just minimize the browser the first window looks like this so I'm going to just click on the next button here and this is the location where your VirtualBox will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change this part just go ahead and click Next and just leave everything as default click Next and then click yes and then click install we're just going to start the process of installing the VirtualBox on your Windows operating system in between you will see these kind of messages which will ask you to install some device related software so I'm going to just click on install and then you can see a straightaway here this Oracle VirtualBox icon is created and after some time you will also see this message which says the installation of VirtualBox is complete and just leave this checkbox checked which is going to launch your VirtualBox after you close that window so this is how VirtualBox looks like you can close it and I'm going to once again open it using this icon so on VirtualBox you can create any virtual machine by just clicking on this new button here and you can see there are a different type of virtual machine you can create for example Windows Linux Solaris BSD IBM Mac OS and other so let's say I want to just install Ubuntu I will just type open to here and you can see this type is Linux and from here you can choose the version of Ubuntu you want to install so you can choose 32bit or 64bit and then go to the next step and then you can choose the other options like memory and the processors and other things right the most important thing you need to have or to install a virtual machine on your host operating system is the ISO file so you can download for example the Ubuntu desktop I also file from the Ubuntu website and then you can just use that ISO file to create open to virtual machine which will allow you to create open to virtual machine and work with Ubuntu on your Windows operating system how you can download and install Ubuntu 20 point zero 4 on your VirtualBox in your Windows 10 operating system so once you have installed VirtualBox on your Windows operating system it's going to look like this and whenever you open VirtualBox it's going to open Oracle VM VirtualBox manager now we are going to download the ISO file which is required to install Ubuntu on our VirtualBox so for downloading the ISO file of Ubuntu you can just search for Ubuntu and the first link which will appear here will be from Ubuntu calm so I'm going to just click on this link and straight away you will see this option here it says what's new in open to 2004 because 2004 is the latest version of Ubuntu which is released recently so here you will see our downloads tab here and when you click on the download tab you will see the Ubuntu desktop so you can just click on the version which is available and most probably you might want to install the LTS version okay so make sure that whenever you install Ubuntu you install the LTS version LTS means the longterm support version which will at least run for two years okay so the support will run for two years so I'm going to just click on open to desktop and here you will see the download button so I'm going to just click on the download button and when you click on the download button the ISO file will be downloaded on your Windows operating system so this file is around 2.5 GB file so it will take some time to download but I have already downloaded this file on my Windows operating system so I'm going to just cancel this download and also if you want to support open to project then you can just give small donation to open for now I don't want to do anything so I have just downloaded the ISO file so once you have downloaded the ISO file it's going to look like this in case you have downloaded the 2004 version of Ubuntu so the name is open to 2004 desktop AMD 64 dot ISO file so once you have downloaded this ISO file we are ready to install Ubuntu on our VirtualBox so on your VirtualBox you just need to click on the new button here and once you click on the new button here you can provide the name of your new machine so my new machine name is Ubuntu so I'm going to just write open to here and let's say I will also give the version of Ubuntu let's say 20 point 0 4 here and straight away VirtualBox is smart enough to provide you the proper options here ok so here you will see the machine folder where all the VirtualBox related files will be downloaded and saved on your Windows operating system and the type here is Linux because open to is a Linux based operating system and the version here is open to 64 bit because we have downloaded the 64bit ISO file ok there is no other option on the website as far as I know if you want to choose any other operating system the procedure is same you just need to select the operating system you want to install and here you can see many choices are given here ok so type is Linux and the version is open to 64bit and then click on next and here in the memory size I generally provide the memory up to the green mark so up to here whatever is allowed on my Windows operating system at this point and then I click on next here just leave everything as default so just leave it as default and then click on the create button now here hi desk file type just leave it as VDI which is VirtualBox disk image and then click on next and here also you just need to leave this as dynamically allocated if you want to learn more about what is dynamically allocated and fixed size you can read from here basically dynamically at located option will allow you're open to operating system to expand the disk size if required and fixed size is the fixed size so we want to allocate the space and disk size are dynamically that's why we have chosen this option here which is dynamically allocated and now click on next and on the next window you can choose the file location this will be the location where your Ubuntu operating system files will be downloaded and installed on your Windows operating systems so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default also you can choose the virtual hard disk size from here by default it's 10 GB selected here but let's say I would just want to increase it to 100 GB so I'm going to just move it around 100 GB and then I'm going to just click on create ok so once you create this machine you will be able to see this new machine here which is open to 20 point 0 4 so just select this machine don't press on the start button yet you just need to select this open 2 machine which you have created and then click on the settings option so on the general settings you will see some options which we have already chosen at the time of creating this machine which is Linux and the version is Ubuntu 64bit now click on advanced settings and then in the shared clipboard option you just need to choose it bidirectional and then drag and drop also bidirectional that will allow you to share your files we between your host machine which is Windows in my case and your virtual machine which will be open to bidirectionally so you will be able to copy and paste into your Ubuntu from your Windows operating system and vice versa ok so in the description you can give any description here and in the disk encryption you just leave it as default now I'm going to just go to the system option here and in the motherboard option you can leave everything as default you just need to go to the processors here and by default VirtualBox will allocate one CPU to your machine so if you have the option you can increase it to whatever CPU one you want to use so for the safer side I always go up to this green mark here ok which is for in my case you can increase the CPU size later also ok in the display settings just leave of everything as default and then move to the storage section here here you need to provide the location of your ISO file wherever you have downloaded your one two iso file so you just need to click on the empty option here so just click on empty under the controller so just choose the CD icon option here and then click on choose our disc file from here ok so just click on choose a disc file from here and then you just need to browse to the location where you have downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so I'm going to just copy the location here and then paste it here and then select the ISO file from here and then click on open so once you have selected your ISO file using this CD icon you will see the name of your ISO file here also let me just move it further you can see the exact name of my ISO file here open to 20 of 0 for desktop MD 64 so once you have done that you can do other settings from here also but I will leave everything as default and click okay and once you have done all those settings you are ready to start your one to installation so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to select Ubuntu 20 point zero 4 and click on start button here and you can see the installation of Ubuntu is going to start in a few seconds you can just close these warning signs here and now you will see this kind of window here so on the left hand side you can choose the language in which you want to install ubuntu you can see many languages are given here but for now I will choose English as my language and then I will click on the install Ubuntu a button here now in the next window you will see the keyboard layout so from here you can choose the keyboard layout whatever keyboard layout you are using on your laptop or on your keyboard so in my case I'm using a German keyboard so I can just move to the German keyboard option here so I'm going to just search for the German keyboard which is this one you can choose any other keyboard from here ok so I'm going to choose the German keyboard and then on the right hand side I will just choose German as the language here and then you can also test your keyboard by typing something in this box so just choose your keyboard language here and then click on continue button and here on this window you will see update and other software's so I normally just leave it as normal installation option checked and also I leave this option also checked which is download updates while installing Ubuntu also I'm going to just check this option also which is installed thirdparty software for graphics and WiFi hardware and additional media formats so just check all the options which I have checked and then click on continue and here in the installation type leave this option as default which is erased disk and install Ubuntu so this is not going to erase anything because you are installing Ubuntu on your VirtualBox you are not installing Ubuntu on your hardware right so don't worry it's not going to erase any disk or anything from your Windows operating system just leave it as erase disk and install Ubuntu and then click on install now now here you will see this warning which says if you continue the changes listed below will be written I will just click on continue button here now in the next step you can choose the location which is nearer to your physical location so I have chosen this location which is nearer to my physical location and then I'm going to click on the continue button and here you can just give the name to your Ubuntu operating system for example I'm going to just write code bind here as the name and as the computer name here I can even remove the VirtualBox from the end because I just want to give the same name as the computer name also and also as the user name I will just leave it as code bind if you want to change these names or so let's say you want to give the different user name here you can do that also and then you can just provide the password I'm going to just provide the password for now it's a weak password but you might want to provide the stronger parts for than this and then you just need to confirm this password and once you are done with that you just need to click on the continue button and now the installation of Ubuntu will start on your VirtualBox so now at this step you don't need to do anything until open to is installed on you're VirtualBox so you just need to wait for some time until this installation is finished so I will also wait for the installation to be finished and after some time you will see this kind of window which says installation is complete you need to restart the computer in order to use the new installation so I'm going to just click on the restart Now button and at this point it says please remove the installation medium then press Enter so I'm going to just press ENTER here and now I can see the Ubuntu operating system is starting and now I can see this login window here so if you remember this is the user name which I have given to my Ubuntu operating system so I will just click on this user and then I will provide the password which I have given at the time of installation and then press Enter so first of all you will see this kind of welcome window here you can click on the Skip option here and also you can just click on the next next and next and then click on done and you will be able to see your Ubuntu desktop here right so when you just click on this maximize button now you will see that this desktop is not maximizing so for that we need to install a tool called VirtualBox guest additions so for installing the VirtualBox guest additions what you need to do is you need to open the terminal so you can just click on this option and then search for terminal here and once the terminal result comes you just need to click on the terminal option now once your terminal opens you just need to give this command I'm going to provide this command in the description of this video also which is to install some essential packages before you install VirtualBox guest additions on your open to operating system so this command is sudo apt install built essentials space DKMS space linux this you name space are okay so just type this command on the Ubuntu terminal and then press Enter and give your Ubuntu password I'm going to just provide my open to is password here and then I will just press yes here or why here and then press ENTER and after some time you will see that all the installation steps are finished so once it's done you can close your terminal and now what you can do is you can just go to devices on your VirtualBox windows so just click on devices here and then click on insert guest additions CD image and once you do that you will be able to see this kind of window so you just need to click on the Run button here so just click on run and then you just need to provide your open to spaz word so I'm going to just provide my Ubuntu is password and then click on authenticate we're just going to open the terminal and it's going to install the VirtualBox guest additions on your open to operating system and after some time you will see this message which says press return to close this window so you just need to press enter here which is going to close this window now at this point you just need to restart your Ubuntu operating system so just go here at the top and then click on power off and then click on power of once again ok so just click on power off and here you don't need to click on restart you just need to click on power off because we just need to shut down our open to operating system first now once it's shut down as I have told you that in the settings you need to go to the Advanced Settings in the general tab and make sure that this shared clipboard and dragdrop option is bidirectional and that will enable you to just copy and paste your files between the VirtualBox and your host operating system now I'm going to start this open to once again and now I'm going to provide my Ubuntu password again and now if you observe when I just drag this window and make the size of this window a little bit bigger the size of Ubuntu desktop also changes and resolution is also better right so when I just maximize this window my Ubuntu desktop size will also change so this is working now now I just want to test whether the copy and paste feature is working or not so I just opened the Firefox browser on my open to operating system and now I'm going to just copy this URL which is on my windows operating system so this is the Google Chrome browser on my Windows operating system and I will just copy this URL and paste it into my open to operating system and you can see this copy and paste option is working here right so this is working similarly when you just copy let's say I'm going to just copy this text from here and go to the browser and open the next tab and paste this thing here you can see you can paste your text from your open to operating system into your Windows operating system so this is how you can install Ubuntu 20.0 4 on your VirtualBox in Windows 10 I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
