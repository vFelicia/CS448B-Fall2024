00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - register rule for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will learn how to use Redis
00:07 - publish/subscribe so Redis
00:11 - publish/subscribe implements the
00:13 - messaging system where sender is called
00:17 - the publisher and the receiver is called
00:21 - the subscriber right now in Redis a
00:25 - client can subscribe to any number of
00:29 - channels so let me give you an example
00:32 - and let me show you how you can use
00:36 - Redis publish/subscribe so you can see I
00:39 - have opened three ready CLI terminals in
00:44 - three different terminals right so this
00:47 - is ready CLI first terminal second
00:50 - terminal and third terminal now first of
00:53 - all I am going to subscribe to a channel
00:57 - so I can just write subscribe here and
01:01 - then it takes a channel name right and I
01:06 - can give any channel name for example
01:10 - Redis or any other channel name so for
01:13 - example my channel and I can subscribe
01:16 - to this channel okay so the name depends
01:20 - upon you right so for example I
01:23 - subscribe to the channel called Redis
01:26 - and I just press enter so now this is or
01:32 - this terminal is subscribed to this
01:36 - channel right now from the second CLI
01:40 - when I publish some message to this
01:43 - channel so let me publish something so
01:47 - to publish a message you can just use a
01:50 - keyword publish as we have seen in
01:53 - subscribe so to subscribe you use a
01:56 - keyword subscribe and then a channel
01:59 - name for publishing you use a keyboard
02:02 - publish and the channel name on which
02:04 - you want to publish right so I want to
02:08 - publish on the Redis channel and then
02:11 - your
02:13 - message for example hi right and I press
02:16 - ENTER and you can see on the subscriber
02:19 - it gets the same message so first of all
02:23 - it will just show you what kind of
02:28 - message is coming so it's a message and
02:31 - then on what channel it's coming and
02:33 - what is the message itself right now if
02:37 - you want to send a big message you can
02:41 - just enclose your message inside these
02:45 - double quotes so for example hello world
02:49 - here and then press ENTER then it's
02:53 - received here okay now it's possible to
02:58 - subscribe to any number of channels
03:02 - right so you can see I am subscribed to
03:05 - Redis from one channel now I can just
03:10 - copy the same command in the next
03:14 - terminal here and then I'm subscribed to
03:18 - this channel so now there are two
03:21 - subscriber subscribe to one Redis
03:25 - channel so this is the channel and I'm
03:28 - subscribed to that Channel right so
03:31 - there are two subscriber for the channel
03:34 - name Redis and when I just send hello
03:39 - world
03:39 - again for example now it is received by
03:44 - both the subscribers right so you can
03:47 - see hello world is received here and
03:50 - hello world is received here okay
03:53 - so this is how publish/subscribe method
03:57 - work in Redis now when you are doing or
04:02 - using Redis in the programming then it's
04:08 - really important or it's really useful
04:11 - so for example recently I created some
04:15 - kind of API where I wanted to listen for
04:18 - any event for save in Redis so whatever
04:23 - is saved whenever
04:25 - some command comes and something is
04:28 - saved in Redis I wanted to subscribe to
04:31 - that save event right and I have used
04:35 - this publish/subscribe method from Redis
04:39 - in that API and it worked fine so it's
04:44 - kind of listening to the trigger for
04:46 - examples for saving the data or some
04:51 - delete deletion of data you can
04:53 - subscribe and then you will get this
04:56 - message on the next side which is
05:00 - subscribing and based on that
05:02 - subscription you can trigger some event
05:05 - okay now let me just close this CLI and
05:11 - once again open the CLI once again and
05:14 - let me clear the terminal once again and
05:16 - there is a command called P subscribe so
05:19 - you can do P subscribe and then it takes
05:22 - the pattern so for example I can just
05:25 - write R and then s tricks are s tricks
05:29 - here means any publisher when it's
05:32 - published on the channel name which
05:35 - start with r it will receive that
05:38 - message so for example I am publishing
05:42 - this publish Redis because this pattern
05:46 - matches this pattern so s tricks is some
05:50 - kind of a wild card here so it's
05:53 - whatever so for example I'm subscribing
05:55 - to our s tricks and I'm just publishing
05:58 - the same message again and you can see
06:01 - it's receiving that message because it's
06:04 - just matching the pattern whatever
06:08 - publisher publishes on the pattern which
06:12 - matches our s tricks for example R and
06:16 - whatever comes after R this is matching
06:20 - that pattern so it will receive that
06:24 - message for example I can just do
06:27 - something like this I on our X for
06:32 - example this also matches this pattern
06:35 - right because we just want to
06:38 - match the first letter of that channel
06:42 - and whatever comes after that it will be
06:45 - matched automatically so this is kind of
06:47 - a pattern matching in Redis so P
06:51 - subscribe is used to pattern matching
06:54 - and whatever publisher channel matches
06:59 - that pattern it will be receiving that
07:02 - message so you can see this is receiving
07:06 - that message but this CLI is not
07:08 - receiving so because we have subscribed
07:10 - to a concrete channel layer which is not
07:15 - a pattern so whenever we just give the
07:21 - raddest channel itself then only it will
07:23 - receive the message and this
07:26 - automatically receives the message
07:27 - because here we are just matching the
07:31 - pattern okay so in this way you can use
07:34 - publish subscribe in Redis I hope you

hey guys welcome to the next video on register rule for beginners in this video we will learn how to use Redis publish/subscribe so Redis publish/subscribe implements the messaging system where sender is called the publisher and the receiver is called the subscriber right now in Redis a client can subscribe to any number of channels so let me give you an example and let me show you how you can use Redis publish/subscribe so you can see I have opened three ready CLI terminals in three different terminals right so this is ready CLI first terminal second terminal and third terminal now first of all I am going to subscribe to a channel so I can just write subscribe here and then it takes a channel name right and I can give any channel name for example Redis or any other channel name so for example my channel and I can subscribe to this channel okay so the name depends upon you right so for example I subscribe to the channel called Redis and I just press enter so now this is or this terminal is subscribed to this channel right now from the second CLI when I publish some message to this channel so let me publish something so to publish a message you can just use a keyword publish as we have seen in subscribe so to subscribe you use a keyword subscribe and then a channel name for publishing you use a keyboard publish and the channel name on which you want to publish right so I want to publish on the Redis channel and then your message for example hi right and I press ENTER and you can see on the subscriber it gets the same message so first of all it will just show you what kind of message is coming so it's a message and then on what channel it's coming and what is the message itself right now if you want to send a big message you can just enclose your message inside these double quotes so for example hello world here and then press ENTER then it's received here okay now it's possible to subscribe to any number of channels right so you can see I am subscribed to Redis from one channel now I can just copy the same command in the next terminal here and then I'm subscribed to this channel so now there are two subscriber subscribe to one Redis channel so this is the channel and I'm subscribed to that Channel right so there are two subscriber for the channel name Redis and when I just send hello world again for example now it is received by both the subscribers right so you can see hello world is received here and hello world is received here okay so this is how publish/subscribe method work in Redis now when you are doing or using Redis in the programming then it's really important or it's really useful so for example recently I created some kind of API where I wanted to listen for any event for save in Redis so whatever is saved whenever some command comes and something is saved in Redis I wanted to subscribe to that save event right and I have used this publish/subscribe method from Redis in that API and it worked fine so it's kind

that subscription you can trigger some event okay now let me just close this CLI and once again open the CLI once again and let me clear the terminal once again and there is a command called P

this is kind of a pattern matching in Redis so P subscribe is used to pattern matching and whatever publisher channel matches that pattern it will be receiving that message so you can see this is receiving that message but this CLI is not receiving so because we have subscribed to a concrete channel layer which is not a pattern so whenever we just give the raddest channel itself then only it
