With timestamps:

00:00 - we are going to cover the most important
00:01 - topic of how this next series that is
00:03 - the user creation okay
00:06 - so basically in this video we are going
00:07 - to cover the how you can create users
00:10 - what are the files affected by you by
00:12 - creating that particular user and how
00:14 - you can create what are the root user
00:16 - sudo command and we are going to cover
00:18 - many things in this particular video
00:20 - okay
00:21 - so before moving forward uh i just want
00:23 - to discuss about a basic
00:26 - a very basic thing that is what are the
00:28 - users okay i hope you you like uh
00:32 - you're aware of it like if you're using
00:34 - this pieces then you are the user if
00:36 - someone else is
00:37 - using this particular uh pc and if he
00:40 - has or she has an account on the speed
00:42 - then he see or he is the user
00:44 - so basically what are the users users
00:46 - are nothing but you can say a particular
00:48 - person or particular entity
00:50 - what he can just like change the files
00:52 - and directories
00:54 - or he can do whatever he want okay
00:58 - so moving forward in this video uh i
01:00 - will
01:01 - uh like start with the very basic thing
01:03 - like uh
01:04 - categories or types of users in our
01:07 - linux system okay
01:09 - so i hope this terminal is visible to
01:11 - you okay
01:12 - i will just write right now i'll just
01:15 - write things
01:16 - [Music]
01:17 - okay so
01:19 - the hash is basically just for comment
01:21 - okay
01:22 - so if whatever i will write it will
01:24 - like not execute as a command okay
01:27 - so there are two types of user in all
01:28 - this linux operating system that is one
01:30 - is root user or you can say
01:32 - administrative user
01:34 - and other one is the normal user okay
01:38 - so what are the root users
01:40 - so if you're following this series then
01:42 - i don't think you are aware of the root
01:43 - user so but now we will cover it what is
01:46 - this
01:47 - so root user is basically that user who
01:50 - has access of the all the files and
01:51 - system like he he is just like
01:53 - administrator he can do anything he
01:56 - wants okay he has access of everything
01:59 - but what a normal user a normal user
02:01 - nothing but like who doesn't have all
02:03 - the access okay
02:05 - so
02:06 - uh if you take a like real life example
02:09 - suppose you are a administrator of this
02:11 - windows pc or linux pc anything
02:14 - okay
02:16 - and there is someone else who who has
02:19 - also access of this pc but he is a
02:20 - normal user
02:22 - so
02:23 - i will just tell you like if you want to
02:26 - change the password of your of your
02:28 - account you can change it
02:29 - okay but if you want to change the
02:31 - password or anything
02:33 - files
02:34 - of that other user then you can access
02:36 - it but that user cannot access the file
02:39 - of this
02:40 - particular what which you use a root
02:43 - user or
02:45 - administrative or administrator okay
02:48 - so basically the difference between
02:50 - in this is like normal user can't access
02:52 - the files of
02:54 - administrative user but in this we can
02:56 - do it using the one of the functionality
02:58 - that is the sudo command okay i will
03:00 - tell you what are the pseudo commands
03:02 - what is this how it works okay
03:06 - so this is all about the basics of
03:08 - difference between the root user and the
03:09 - normal user i hope you got it
03:12 - now moving forward uh
03:14 - now i will tell you about the sudo
03:16 - command what is this okay
03:19 - but before it i will try to like
03:22 - cover one thing also the root user i
03:24 - will first set up the root user then i
03:26 - will tell you about the sudo command
03:27 - what are the root users
03:29 - like i just discussed like he has access
03:30 - to all the permission but
03:33 - by default in this ubuntu root user
03:36 - doesn't work because it is disabled okay
03:39 - so to enable it uh what you can do you
03:41 - can just simply change the password
03:42 - because you know the dot user is created
03:44 - you will just change the password
03:47 - okay
03:48 - so
03:49 - i will need sudo also because i don't i
03:52 - think it requires
03:54 - permission
03:56 - so the this passwd is a command to
03:59 - change the user or to change the
04:01 - password of any user so i am changing
04:02 - the route
04:06 - here it is asking for
04:08 - my password and here i will try to
04:13 - that password of this root user okay
04:16 - so here we have successfully changed the
04:18 - password of this
04:19 - root user
04:20 - so
04:21 - now to log in as a root user what you
04:23 - can do you can change the switch user
04:26 - okay
04:27 - ac root means uh
04:29 - su stands for switch user and root is
04:31 - there's a username of that particular
04:33 - user and here i will type the password
04:36 - and here you can see the hostname has
04:37 - been changed from ius to the
04:39 - root i will do ls here
04:41 - so there i have all the files i can see
04:43 - here
04:44 - if i will go to go back i'll do ls here
04:47 - you can say test user has been created
04:48 - by me okay
04:51 - so
04:52 - that's all about it like root user
04:55 - now uh what i will do exit from this
04:58 - root user okay
05:01 - so we have created the root user and we
05:03 - have successfully set up the root user
05:04 - now moving forward the i was going to
05:06 - tell you about the sudo command what is
05:08 - this sudo sudo what is the sudo command
05:10 - like there is a boom of sudo like if
05:13 - anything doesn't work then you will just
05:14 - apply sudo and that thing will work okay
05:17 - so how it work basically that sudo
05:18 - command is nothing but uh like um
05:21 - you can say
05:22 - how should i explain uh let me explain
05:24 - it by you an example suppose uh you have
05:27 - a file okay
05:29 - file.txt
05:31 - you don't have access to it okay but if
05:33 - you want to access to it you can use the
05:35 - sudo command to access it okay i'm just
05:37 - giving you an example
05:39 - so
05:40 - how it works basically uh
05:43 - sudo command when you use it it will
05:46 - like uh it will work on behalf of the
05:49 - which user
05:51 - the root user okay the root user
05:55 - because root user has access to all the
05:58 - files okay
05:59 - so what you will do you will try to
06:03 - access that file on behalf of root user
06:07 - okay i hope you got it
06:08 - okay
06:09 - so but now there is a question like then
06:13 - every user like suppose i am this ios
06:16 - user i can access suppose i create some
06:18 - another user i used to then he can also
06:21 - access this particular administrative
06:23 - file but no
06:24 - the
06:25 - that's not a thing
06:26 - for this to work what you will need to
06:28 - do you will need to this i used to into
06:30 - a sudoers file that is some kind of file
06:33 - that is sudors i think that that is the
06:35 - name i will google it okay
06:37 - not remember i think this is the file
06:39 - sudo file it is there okay so in this
06:42 - file that particular user should be
06:44 - added or should be present to run sudo
06:47 - command okay
06:49 - so you will see all these things after
06:52 - when you will create a user and all
06:54 - these things you will see it everything
06:55 - okay so don't worry about it
06:59 - so have you got it what is the sudo
07:00 - command and all these things now moving
07:02 - on to the main topic of our this video
07:05 - is the
07:07 - user creation okay
07:10 - so before starting uh
07:12 - there are some concepts which you should
07:14 - learn okay so i have already written it
07:16 - on this notion okay
07:19 - so the concept which you should learn
07:21 - the
07:22 - first and basic thing is uid what is the
07:25 - uid you added nothing but a user
07:28 - identification number you can say or
07:30 - user identifier
07:32 - so in linux every user has their own
07:34 - unique id
07:36 - okay so i will tell you my unique id
07:38 - so
07:39 - if you will type id and ios
07:43 - here you can see my uid is 1000 and gid
07:46 - is 1000 this is the group id
07:48 - and groups and all these things okay
07:51 - so
07:52 - now you have to focus only on this this
07:54 - part uid so now my uid is what 1000
07:58 - okay if i want to change look at the
08:01 - root id what are the what is the uid of
08:04 - the root
08:05 - so this is only zero okay
08:08 - so that's thing i have written here like
08:10 - the ranges of uid is from 1 to 500
08:15 - only for
08:20 - so here for system users uid ranges from
08:23 - 1 to 500 and for the other users it
08:26 - starts from 1000 as in the ubuntu and
08:29 - fedora it just starts from 1000 1000 but
08:32 - 0 0 is reserved for which user root user
08:36 - or administrative user it is just the
08:39 - root is just the username okay
08:41 - so this is the concept of the uid okay
08:45 - so now what i will i'm going to tell you
08:48 - like uid i you got it the id is 0 for
08:51 - the root user and 1000 for the i use
08:53 - okay this is the id which is generated
08:55 - for if whatever user you will create it
08:58 - will get added
08:59 - by one and one okay
09:02 - so now the next concept is uh the
09:07 - where the details of user is stored okay
09:10 - so there are some kind of files
09:13 - which are getting affected when you
09:15 - create a user the most
09:17 - like uh
09:18 - usual or you can say important file
09:21 - that is
09:22 - a passwd is one of the file
09:24 - and other file is uh slash the etc
09:30 - shadow
09:32 - slash it is just a directory it's just
09:34 - their location where it exists okay
09:37 - so they'll be a pa pass wd and shadow
09:40 - file are the two files which get
09:41 - affected and also there are some other
09:43 - files
09:44 - so
09:44 - those we will not cover right now
09:47 - so these are the two files which getting
09:49 - affected okay
09:52 - so now if you will see the content of
09:54 - the
09:55 - slash ctc pass wt okay
09:58 - so
09:59 - what you will see
10:01 - wow
10:02 - i don't think you will understand
10:03 - anything right now okay let me clear
10:05 - this screen but before that let me tell
10:07 - you about this what is the password file
10:10 - or passwd files okay so in this file
10:12 - basically uh the
10:15 - information is stored about the user it
10:18 - means what information the uid
10:21 - okay their group id
10:23 - their
10:24 - name
10:25 - okay
10:27 - and other information and also some
10:29 - other information like linux login cell
10:31 - information are stored in this
10:33 - particular file
10:34 - okay so if i'll do cad slash ctc let me
10:37 - increase the
10:41 - okay
10:42 - so the first entry is of which user the
10:46 - first entry is of the root user okay
10:50 - and the second x is just for the
10:52 - password like here
10:53 - password doesn't like
10:56 - it
10:56 - [Music]
10:57 - like it doesn't display your password it
10:59 - is password is stored in another file
11:01 - that is a shadow file okay in the hash
11:03 - format type okay
11:05 - and then this is the group id this uid
11:08 - group id their group user group
11:11 - and
11:12 - their home directory
11:14 - and the shell which they are using okay
11:16 - pin bash so there is the like uh
11:22 - i break every part of that particular
11:26 - like
11:27 - thing like there are seven
11:29 - what yeah
11:31 - seven separators or you can say seven
11:33 - concepts you can say okay
11:36 - in this particular file so here you can
11:38 - see uh mark
11:40 - mark is what username
11:42 - x is what password 1001 is what uid
11:47 - again 1001 is what the id
11:50 - again here is the additional information
11:54 - okay
11:54 - and this is the home directory
11:57 - and this is the
11:59 - login
12:00 - shell
12:01 - so what is the login shell but before
12:03 - understanding this you need to
12:04 - understand what is cell cell is nothing
12:06 - but which provides you an interface okay
12:09 - to work okay you can understand a login
12:11 - cell is nothing but uh
12:14 - like whenever you login into the
12:15 - particular system then it starts working
12:18 - like you will learn about shell and bash
12:20 - scripting or bash shell you will learn
12:22 - when we will start the
12:24 - basis scripting concept okay
12:27 - so there are also some other sales you
12:29 - can see
12:30 - uh like jnu c shell conch shell jet
12:33 - shell
12:34 - okay
12:35 - so now what uh uh i'm going to do i will
12:39 - create a one user okay but before that
12:42 - uh yeah one more concept is remaining
12:43 - here like
12:45 - slash ctc shadow okay now we will uh
12:47 - [Music]
12:48 - come back on this point later on after
12:50 - creating user
12:52 - and also here you can see in my the
12:54 - first user that it's ayush and 1000 is
12:57 - the uid gid and this is group additional
13:01 - info
13:02 - okay
13:02 - [Music]
13:05 - so now what i have to do
13:08 - i'll clear the screen
13:10 - and i will going to add
13:12 - some users in this particular
13:17 - video
13:18 - or so i will use sudo command why sudo
13:22 - because user add command uh
13:25 - like does not work directly you can try
13:27 - also if i will do user that it will
13:29 - give me the all the options but also if
13:32 - i will try to add user some kind of
13:34 - thing like some
13:36 - you can say which user
13:42 - test22 so here you can see permission do
13:45 - not by permission internet because
13:47 - you don't have access to run this user
13:49 - add command because only root can add
13:51 - users so now what we will do we are
13:53 - going to add user on behalf of the root
13:55 - account okay that's why we will use sudo
13:58 - now now i think you got the main concept
14:00 - of this sudo
14:03 - sudo
14:04 - user ad i will
14:06 - write some good name let's take a mic
14:10 - no we write let's stick with that okay
14:13 - and
14:14 - sudo user ad without just
14:17 - uh this is the username now i will hit
14:20 - enter and the user has been created now
14:22 - to look at the file whether user has
14:25 - been created or not what i will
14:28 - do i will open up another terminal
14:32 - [Music]
14:34 - okay
14:35 - and i will just read the password file
14:40 - and here you can see
14:42 - vdot user has been created
14:44 - and we still have not saved the password
14:46 - okay and the uid has been given to that
14:49 - particular user 1002
14:51 - and another group id has been given to
14:54 - 1002
14:55 - and this is the home vid has been
14:57 - created but using user add command it
14:59 - does not reflect let's check whether it
15:02 - reflects or not
15:05 - if i do ls here you can see without
15:07 - directory has not been created i will
15:09 - tell you everything how you can do it
15:10 - using user ad command okay
15:12 - and the shell which are being used by
15:14 - this is
15:15 - bin sh okay
15:18 - so uh like in this way you can simply
15:21 - like uh
15:24 - add a user you know in your system now
15:26 - to change the password or assign the
15:29 - password what you will need to do
15:35 - the password command you will use sudo
15:37 - password we
15:38 - not password let's write same we write
15:42 - we're at
15:44 - okay password updated successfully
15:46 - now the
15:47 - other file which come in role in this
15:51 - user creation process that is shadow
15:53 - file in shadow file what happens like
15:58 - all the passwords are stored in the hash
16:00 - format okay
16:01 - now
16:02 - let's take a look at the shadow file
16:08 - so that you can see permission denied so
16:10 - what i can do i will just use sudo
16:12 - because now i will run this command as
16:14 - on behalf of the
16:15 - root user
16:17 - now it will ask you for the password
16:19 - just enter and here you can see virat
16:22 - okay
16:26 - so virat is there and this is the
16:28 - hash format of your password
16:31 - okay
16:33 - and
16:34 - next here is the
16:37 - when password created or password chain
16:39 - expired right now all things now let me
16:41 - open up this to simplify this
16:44 - uh
16:45 - yeah here you can see mark dollar six
16:47 - dollar
16:48 - this is the whole
16:51 - like hash format encrypted password you
16:53 - can say
16:54 - and this is the when last password was
16:56 - changed
16:57 - then again
16:59 - their minimum password age
17:02 - and then maximum password age
17:05 - again warning period inactivity
17:07 - expiration unused all these things is
17:09 - like in this
17:11 - shadow file you can get but we have not
17:13 - assigned any kind of those things like
17:15 - expiry date all these things so that's
17:16 - why we are not able to say it
17:19 - so there are some
17:20 - encrypted password you can say what are
17:22 - the format like dollar type dollar short
17:25 - dollar hashtag the format to store your
17:27 - password
17:28 - so if it is one then it is md5 it is
17:31 - two-way it is blow face this is uh 2y
17:34 - e case blow face
17:36 - you can say all this thing is dollar
17:37 - five and second sha-256 and 512 now for
17:41 - dollar y it is uh yes script so it is
17:43 - also one of the method you can learn
17:45 - about it
17:47 - and now uh if you will learn about the
17:49 - last password change or in this what
17:52 - happens it uh calculates from this state
17:55 - january 1970
17:57 - okay and for expiry like it also like uh
18:02 - calculate from that particular
18:04 - day
18:06 - so i hope you got it the like what are
18:08 - the
18:09 - password file what are the shadow files
18:12 - if you want to take a screenshot you can
18:14 - take
18:14 - of this particular content so it will be
18:17 - helpful to understand you
18:19 - okay
18:20 - and for password you can
18:24 - just like you can take the screenshot of
18:25 - this particular part
18:29 - okay
18:30 - so now um
18:33 - what we have to do we have successfully
18:35 - created
18:36 - this particular
18:38 - user
18:39 - now what we will do we are going to
18:40 - login
18:42 - okay we are going to login using that
18:44 - particular username and password so you
18:47 - can do seo
18:50 - and
18:53 - username we not
18:55 - and the password which you have set will
18:57 - not and here you
18:58 - you are in this
19:00 - particular user
19:02 - shell
19:05 - so here you can see who am i that is
19:06 - virat if i'll do ls so you don't have
19:09 - permission
19:10 - because the user simply just add the
19:12 - user adds a user reach so you will need
19:15 - to perform some other actions also okay
19:20 - so i will exit to from this cell
19:26 - [Music]
19:30 - okay let me clear the screen here also
19:34 - and now what i'm going to do
19:36 - i will just
19:39 - like use the other options which you can
19:42 - use with the user add command okay like
19:44 - there are multiple options which you can
19:46 - use
19:47 - okay
19:48 - so
19:50 - to create a home directory which option
19:52 - we use we use hyphen m option
19:55 - okay
19:56 - and to create a
19:59 - [Music]
20:01 - like user with your
20:03 - own user id then we use hyphen u option
20:08 - okay
20:10 - and to add some command commands we use
20:12 - hyphen c option
20:15 - okay
20:18 - wait a minute hyphen c option
20:22 - so that's all
20:24 - and hyphen s option is also used to
20:27 - assign the login shell
20:29 - okay
20:30 - so uh we can use this one by one or in a
20:34 - single command also
20:36 - okay
20:37 - so
20:38 - uh for your simplicity or really like
20:41 - to make it simple i will use first one
20:44 - by one then i will like
20:49 - and
20:51 - everything in a single command
20:53 - now here i will i am creating
20:56 - iphone in vr2 okay
21:00 - so permission denied so i forgot to use
21:02 - sudo i will use sudo and again uv right
21:04 - 2 has been created i will check the file
21:07 - shadow file here we have not used
21:09 - password we have not set password yet
21:12 - uh sorry not shadow i have to use
21:14 - password okay so as you can see we route
21:16 - 2 has been created with the
21:19 - user id 1003 and the home we write to
21:23 - let's check whether this home director
21:25 - has been created or not i will do cd dot
21:27 - slash ls and here you can see where
21:28 - virat 2 has been
21:31 - created okay nice
21:35 - and i will now i will try to create some
21:37 - other user using
21:39 - iphone m also and also i will try to use
21:42 - iphone u i will assign some other id
21:45 - like 1500
21:47 - okay
21:48 - and also i will use hyphen c so
21:52 - okay
21:53 - so here this is
21:56 - we
21:56 - write three
22:00 - and hit enter
22:03 - oh sorry
22:05 - uh
22:06 - here i forgot to change the name of the
22:07 - user we had three
22:10 - so user has been created successfully
22:13 - again password so here you can see we
22:15 - ran three
22:17 - x password we have not set yet 1500 is
22:19 - the user id and the group id this is the
22:21 - additional information which you wanted
22:23 - to give that is brought three
22:26 - home viral three and bin bin sh is there
22:29 - it should be bin bash to like reflect
22:32 - like this okay
22:33 - i use an ice virtual box
22:36 - so uh now what i will do i will use
22:38 - hyphen s option
22:41 - let me increase this maximize it okay
22:46 - so hyphen c you have used and let's use
22:49 - hyphen s
22:51 - let me clear the screen first
22:54 - what happened
22:55 - [Music]
22:59 - wait a minute
23:07 - okay hyphen s
23:10 - slash pin bash
23:13 - okay
23:17 - what i'll do i will first copy a
23:20 - you can copy using ctrl shift c
23:26 - yeah now i will do virat 4
23:29 - okay so sudo user ad hyphen what this it
23:33 - will do it will just like create a home
23:34 - directory hyphen you for assigning uh
23:37 - the
23:38 - particular user ide so 1500 we have
23:40 - already assigned let's assign like 1500
23:43 - oh surely
23:45 - 1500
23:47 - one
23:48 - this is virat 4
23:50 - iphone is bin bash without 4
23:53 - okay we will hit enter and user has been
23:56 - created let's
23:58 - check
24:02 - in this particular file
24:05 - cad slash ctc slash
24:09 - and here you can see we're at four
24:11 - fifteen hundred one this is we're at
24:12 - four home and let's check home has been
24:14 - returned home directly so here you can
24:16 - see we have has been
24:18 - created now what we will do we will
24:19 - change the password of this particular
24:22 - user that is vidart4 so or you can do it
24:25 - using sudo command sudo password we not
24:28 - 4
24:30 - done now what you will do new password
24:32 - just enter anything which you want
24:35 - without without i'm just typing and
24:38 - password has been also added now what i
24:40 - will do i will try to access the shadow
24:42 - file so instead of file
24:45 - you can see the
24:48 - hash format
24:49 - all these things okay
24:52 - so now what i will do i will just try to
24:53 - log in using the vdot 4
24:56 - suv 4
24:58 - oh sorry
25:01 - and then again enter the password and uh
25:05 - i don't think i have entered wrong
25:07 - password
25:10 - v rod for
25:14 - okay no no no sorry it's password is
25:16 - only we write okay
25:21 - okay let's again change the password y
25:23 - to okay caps lock is enabled no no
25:27 - again change the password
25:31 - i will need to use sudo
25:38 - i forgot every time to use sudo
25:41 - now i will try to switch user
25:46 - [Music]
25:47 - okay
25:48 - so now where are you
25:52 - in the
25:56 - we wrath for home directory if you will
25:59 - do pwd
26:01 - you are in virat food if you will who am
26:03 - i you are in virat food okay so
26:06 - congratulation you have successfully
26:08 - created
26:10 - one user and you have like you have all
26:13 - you have said the password of it you
26:15 - have created the home directory for it
26:17 - everything okay done
26:19 - so now what you can do
26:22 - um
26:27 - uh what you can do now
26:29 - yeah
26:30 - so uh you can see the
26:33 - multiple process we did in this like
26:36 - first we created user using user add
26:39 - then we provided using hyphen f option
26:42 - to create home directory then for
26:45 - shell we use hyphen s option for command
26:48 - we use hyphen c option
26:51 - and for the
26:53 - and what else we used for uid you used
26:56 - hyphen u option
26:58 - okay
26:59 - so these are the multiple option you are
27:00 - using the user add command so basically
27:03 - user add command is the low level
27:05 - utility which means like it is earlier
27:07 - used but now it's
27:08 - there is also other
27:10 - utility that is add user it is a high
27:12 - level utility you can see
27:14 - okay so this is also useful because
27:17 - sometimes in kind of automation thing
27:20 - you need it okay
27:22 - or
27:24 - yeah but you should know this method
27:26 - also so now moving forward what i'm
27:28 - going to do
27:30 - i'm just
27:31 - let me like list all the
27:38 - so without two three four has been
27:40 - getting 15 and one okay
27:42 - so now what i'm going to do i'm going to
27:44 - add a user using the
27:47 - simple command that is
27:50 - add user command okay
27:52 - so how you can do it sudo
27:55 - add user
27:57 - and the username which you want to give
27:59 - i just want to give as a search in
28:03 - okay
28:05 - what it is showing me please enter a
28:07 - user name matching the regular
28:09 - expression configured
28:14 - here's the iphone force okay i think
28:16 - i'll need to write as a small casing
28:20 - yes
28:21 - so here you can see you can't use
28:23 - capital later okay
28:25 - so here you can see adding user search
28:27 - in adding a new group search in here
28:29 - group is also added i do i didn't talk
28:31 - about group in this video i will talk
28:33 - about in the later video okay
28:35 - and then you have to here only you have
28:38 - to enter the password like
28:41 - searching
28:42 - and again you have to enter the password
28:45 - and then here if you want to give a full
28:48 - name you can give
28:51 - chin tendul
28:54 - room number one two three word phone
28:58 - seven eight nine four five six one two
28:59 - three
29:00 - oh sorry sorry
29:04 - one two three four five six seven eight
29:06 - nine zero
29:08 - home number zero nine eight seven six
29:09 - five four three two one
29:11 - other two nine seven six four
29:13 - if you if you didn't enter anything it
29:15 - will be blank okay other is the
29:17 - information correct yes obviously
29:20 - why
29:21 - so now
29:22 - user has been created
29:24 - so this is a very simple command like in
29:28 - just one command you in create you can
29:30 - set the password you can add if any
29:32 - extra information you want to add
29:34 - okay
29:35 - so using this command you can simply do
29:38 - those things okay
29:41 - so if i will check the
29:43 - content of password so here you can see
29:45 - searching
29:46 - one zero zero four has been
29:48 - id assigned to sachin
29:50 - full name
29:51 - their phone number whatever it is room
29:54 - number home number
29:56 - and the directory directory has been
29:57 - also created let's check
30:01 - ls so here you can see sachin and now
30:04 - let's login using sachin
30:09 - now you are here and
30:14 - if you will do ls so there is nothing
30:17 - any file so in this way also you can add
30:19 - users
30:20 - okay
30:21 - so that's all for today's video guys i
30:23 - hope you liked it and if you have yeah
30:26 - if you have any queries then please you
30:28 - can ask us in the comment section okay
30:30 - so that's all for today and we will meet
30:32 - in the next video with another concept
30:34 - so that's all so thank you thank you
30:36 - guys for watching this video and we'll
30:38 - meet in the next one thank you

Cleaned transcript:

we are going to cover the most important topic of how this next series that is the user creation okay so basically in this video we are going to cover the how you can create users what are the files affected by you by creating that particular user and how you can create what are the root user sudo command and we are going to cover many things in this particular video okay so before moving forward uh i just want to discuss about a basic a very basic thing that is what are the users okay i hope you you like uh you're aware of it like if you're using this pieces then you are the user if someone else is using this particular uh pc and if he has or she has an account on the speed then he see or he is the user so basically what are the users users are nothing but you can say a particular person or particular entity what he can just like change the files and directories or he can do whatever he want okay so moving forward in this video uh i will uh like start with the very basic thing like uh categories or types of users in our linux system okay so i hope this terminal is visible to you okay i will just write right now i'll just write things okay so the hash is basically just for comment okay so if whatever i will write it will like not execute as a command okay so there are two types of user in all this linux operating system that is one is root user or you can say administrative user and other one is the normal user okay so what are the root users so if you're following this series then i don't think you are aware of the root user so but now we will cover it what is this so root user is basically that user who has access of the all the files and system like he he is just like administrator he can do anything he wants okay he has access of everything but what a normal user a normal user nothing but like who doesn't have all the access okay so uh if you take a like real life example suppose you are a administrator of this windows pc or linux pc anything okay and there is someone else who who has also access of this pc but he is a normal user so i will just tell you like if you want to change the password of your of your account you can change it okay but if you want to change the password or anything files of that other user then you can access it but that user cannot access the file of this particular what which you use a root user or administrative or administrator okay so basically the difference between in this is like normal user can't access the files of administrative user but in this we can do it using the one of the functionality that is the sudo command okay i will tell you what are the pseudo commands what is this how it works okay so this is all about the basics of difference between the root user and the normal user i hope you got it now moving forward uh now i will tell you about the sudo command what is this okay but before it i will try to like cover one thing also the root user i will first set up the root user then i will tell you about the sudo command what are the root users like i just discussed like he has access to all the permission but by default in this ubuntu root user doesn't work because it is disabled okay so to enable it uh what you can do you can just simply change the password because you know the dot user is created you will just change the password okay so i will need sudo also because i don't i think it requires permission so the this passwd is a command to change the user or to change the password of any user so i am changing the route here it is asking for my password and here i will try to that password of this root user okay so here we have successfully changed the password of this root user so now to log in as a root user what you can do you can change the switch user okay ac root means uh su stands for switch user and root is there's a username of that particular user and here i will type the password and here you can see the hostname has been changed from ius to the root i will do ls here so there i have all the files i can see here if i will go to go back i'll do ls here you can say test user has been created by me okay so that's all about it like root user now uh what i will do exit from this root user okay so we have created the root user and we have successfully set up the root user now moving forward the i was going to tell you about the sudo command what is this sudo sudo what is the sudo command like there is a boom of sudo like if anything doesn't work then you will just apply sudo and that thing will work okay so how it work basically that sudo command is nothing but uh like um you can say how should i explain uh let me explain it by you an example suppose uh you have a file okay file.txt you don't have access to it okay but if you want to access to it you can use the sudo command to access it okay i'm just giving you an example so how it works basically uh sudo command when you use it it will like uh it will work on behalf of the which user the root user okay the root user because root user has access to all the files okay so what you will do you will try to access that file on behalf of root user okay i hope you got it okay so but now there is a question like then every user like suppose i am this ios user i can access suppose i create some another user i used to then he can also access this particular administrative file but no the that's not a thing for this to work what you will need to do you will need to this i used to into a sudoers file that is some kind of file that is sudors i think that that is the name i will google it okay not remember i think this is the file sudo file it is there okay so in this file that particular user should be added or should be present to run sudo command okay so you will see all these things after when you will create a user and all these things you will see it everything okay so don't worry about it so have you got it what is the sudo command and all these things now moving on to the main topic of our this video is the user creation okay so before starting uh there are some concepts which you should learn okay so i have already written it on this notion okay so the concept which you should learn the first and basic thing is uid what is the uid you added nothing but a user identification number you can say or user identifier so in linux every user has their own unique id okay so i will tell you my unique id so if you will type id and ios here you can see my uid is 1000 and gid is 1000 this is the group id and groups and all these things okay so now you have to focus only on this this part uid so now my uid is what 1000 okay if i want to change look at the root id what are the what is the uid of the root so this is only zero okay so that's thing i have written here like the ranges of uid is from 1 to 500 only for so here for system users uid ranges from 1 to 500 and for the other users it starts from 1000 as in the ubuntu and fedora it just starts from 1000 1000 but 0 0 is reserved for which user root user or administrative user it is just the root is just the username okay so this is the concept of the uid okay so now what i will i'm going to tell you like uid i you got it the id is 0 for the root user and 1000 for the i use okay this is the id which is generated for if whatever user you will create it will get added by one and one okay so now the next concept is uh the where the details of user is stored okay so there are some kind of files which are getting affected when you create a user the most like uh usual or you can say important file that is a passwd is one of the file and other file is uh slash the etc shadow slash it is just a directory it's just their location where it exists okay so they'll be a pa pass wd and shadow file are the two files which get affected and also there are some other files so those we will not cover right now so these are the two files which getting affected okay so now if you will see the content of the slash ctc pass wt okay so what you will see wow i don't think you will understand anything right now okay let me clear this screen but before that let me tell you about this what is the password file or passwd files okay so in this file basically uh the information is stored about the user it means what information the uid okay their group id their name okay and other information and also some other information like linux login cell information are stored in this particular file okay so if i'll do cad slash ctc let me increase the okay so the first entry is of which user the first entry is of the root user okay and the second x is just for the password like here password doesn't like it like it doesn't display your password it is password is stored in another file that is a shadow file okay in the hash format type okay and then this is the group id this uid group id their group user group and their home directory and the shell which they are using okay pin bash so there is the like uh i break every part of that particular like thing like there are seven what yeah seven separators or you can say seven concepts you can say okay in this particular file so here you can see uh mark mark is what username x is what password 1001 is what uid again 1001 is what the id again here is the additional information okay and this is the home directory and this is the login shell so what is the login shell but before understanding this you need to understand what is cell cell is nothing but which provides you an interface okay to work okay you can understand a login cell is nothing but uh like whenever you login into the particular system then it starts working like you will learn about shell and bash scripting or bash shell you will learn when we will start the basis scripting concept okay so there are also some other sales you can see uh like jnu c shell conch shell jet shell okay so now what uh uh i'm going to do i will create a one user okay but before that uh yeah one more concept is remaining here like slash ctc shadow okay now we will uh come back on this point later on after creating user and also here you can see in my the first user that it's ayush and 1000 is the uid gid and this is group additional info okay so now what i have to do i'll clear the screen and i will going to add some users in this particular video or so i will use sudo command why sudo because user add command uh like does not work directly you can try also if i will do user that it will give me the all the options but also if i will try to add user some kind of thing like some you can say which user test22 so here you can see permission do not by permission internet because you don't have access to run this user add command because only root can add users so now what we will do we are going to add user on behalf of the root account okay that's why we will use sudo now now i think you got the main concept of this sudo sudo user ad i will write some good name let's take a mic no we write let's stick with that okay and sudo user ad without just uh this is the username now i will hit enter and the user has been created now to look at the file whether user has been created or not what i will do i will open up another terminal okay and i will just read the password file and here you can see vdot user has been created and we still have not saved the password okay and the uid has been given to that particular user 1002 and another group id has been given to 1002 and this is the home vid has been created but using user add command it does not reflect let's check whether it reflects or not if i do ls here you can see without directory has not been created i will tell you everything how you can do it using user ad command okay and the shell which are being used by this is bin sh okay so uh like in this way you can simply like uh add a user you know in your system now to change the password or assign the password what you will need to do the password command you will use sudo password we not password let's write same we write we're at okay password updated successfully now the other file which come in role in this user creation process that is shadow file in shadow file what happens like all the passwords are stored in the hash format okay now let's take a look at the shadow file so that you can see permission denied so what i can do i will just use sudo because now i will run this command as on behalf of the root user now it will ask you for the password just enter and here you can see virat okay so virat is there and this is the hash format of your password okay and next here is the when password created or password chain expired right now all things now let me open up this to simplify this uh yeah here you can see mark dollar six dollar this is the whole like hash format encrypted password you can say and this is the when last password was changed then again their minimum password age and then maximum password age again warning period inactivity expiration unused all these things is like in this shadow file you can get but we have not assigned any kind of those things like expiry date all these things so that's why we are not able to say it so there are some encrypted password you can say what are the format like dollar type dollar short dollar hashtag the format to store your password so if it is one then it is md5 it is twoway it is blow face this is uh 2y e case blow face you can say all this thing is dollar five and second sha256 and 512 now for dollar y it is uh yes script so it is also one of the method you can learn about it and now uh if you will learn about the last password change or in this what happens it uh calculates from this state january 1970 okay and for expiry like it also like uh calculate from that particular day so i hope you got it the like what are the password file what are the shadow files if you want to take a screenshot you can take of this particular content so it will be helpful to understand you okay and for password you can just like you can take the screenshot of this particular part okay so now um what we have to do we have successfully created this particular user now what we will do we are going to login okay we are going to login using that particular username and password so you can do seo and username we not and the password which you have set will not and here you you are in this particular user shell so here you can see who am i that is virat if i'll do ls so you don't have permission because the user simply just add the user adds a user reach so you will need to perform some other actions also okay so i will exit to from this cell okay let me clear the screen here also and now what i'm going to do i will just like use the other options which you can use with the user add command okay like there are multiple options which you can use okay so to create a home directory which option we use we use hyphen m option okay and to create a like user with your own user id then we use hyphen u option okay and to add some command commands we use hyphen c option okay wait a minute hyphen c option so that's all and hyphen s option is also used to assign the login shell okay so uh we can use this one by one or in a single command also okay so uh for your simplicity or really like to make it simple i will use first one by one then i will like and everything in a single command now here i will i am creating iphone in vr2 okay so permission denied so i forgot to use sudo i will use sudo and again uv right 2 has been created i will check the file shadow file here we have not used password we have not set password yet uh sorry not shadow i have to use password okay so as you can see we route 2 has been created with the user id 1003 and the home we write to let's check whether this home director has been created or not i will do cd dot slash ls and here you can see where virat 2 has been created okay nice and i will now i will try to create some other user using iphone m also and also i will try to use iphone u i will assign some other id like 1500 okay and also i will use hyphen c so okay so here this is we write three and hit enter oh sorry uh here i forgot to change the name of the user we had three so user has been created successfully again password so here you can see we ran three x password we have not set yet 1500 is the user id and the group id this is the additional information which you wanted to give that is brought three home viral three and bin bin sh is there it should be bin bash to like reflect like this okay i use an ice virtual box so uh now what i will do i will use hyphen s option let me increase this maximize it okay so hyphen c you have used and let's use hyphen s let me clear the screen first what happened wait a minute okay hyphen s slash pin bash okay what i'll do i will first copy a you can copy using ctrl shift c yeah now i will do virat 4 okay so sudo user ad hyphen what this it will do it will just like create a home directory hyphen you for assigning uh the particular user ide so 1500 we have already assigned let's assign like 1500 oh surely 1500 one this is virat 4 iphone is bin bash without 4 okay we will hit enter and user has been created let's check in this particular file cad slash ctc slash and here you can see we're at four fifteen hundred one this is we're at four home and let's check home has been returned home directly so here you can see we have has been created now what we will do we will change the password of this particular user that is vidart4 so or you can do it using sudo command sudo password we not 4 done now what you will do new password just enter anything which you want without without i'm just typing and password has been also added now what i will do i will try to access the shadow file so instead of file you can see the hash format all these things okay so now what i will do i will just try to log in using the vdot 4 suv 4 oh sorry and then again enter the password and uh i don't think i have entered wrong password v rod for okay no no no sorry it's password is only we write okay okay let's again change the password y to okay caps lock is enabled no no again change the password i will need to use sudo i forgot every time to use sudo now i will try to switch user okay so now where are you in the we wrath for home directory if you will do pwd you are in virat food if you will who am i you are in virat food okay so congratulation you have successfully created one user and you have like you have all you have said the password of it you have created the home directory for it everything okay done so now what you can do um uh what you can do now yeah so uh you can see the multiple process we did in this like first we created user using user add then we provided using hyphen f option to create home directory then for shell we use hyphen s option for command we use hyphen c option and for the and what else we used for uid you used hyphen u option okay so these are the multiple option you are using the user add command so basically user add command is the low level utility which means like it is earlier used but now it's there is also other utility that is add user it is a high level utility you can see okay so this is also useful because sometimes in kind of automation thing you need it okay or yeah but you should know this method also so now moving forward what i'm going to do i'm just let me like list all the so without two three four has been getting 15 and one okay so now what i'm going to do i'm going to add a user using the simple command that is add user command okay so how you can do it sudo add user and the username which you want to give i just want to give as a search in okay what it is showing me please enter a user name matching the regular expression configured here's the iphone force okay i think i'll need to write as a small casing yes so here you can see you can't use capital later okay so here you can see adding user search in adding a new group search in here group is also added i do i didn't talk about group in this video i will talk about in the later video okay and then you have to here only you have to enter the password like searching and again you have to enter the password and then here if you want to give a full name you can give chin tendul room number one two three word phone seven eight nine four five six one two three oh sorry sorry one two three four five six seven eight nine zero home number zero nine eight seven six five four three two one other two nine seven six four if you if you didn't enter anything it will be blank okay other is the information correct yes obviously why so now user has been created so this is a very simple command like in just one command you in create you can set the password you can add if any extra information you want to add okay so using this command you can simply do those things okay so if i will check the content of password so here you can see searching one zero zero four has been id assigned to sachin full name their phone number whatever it is room number home number and the directory directory has been also created let's check ls so here you can see sachin and now let's login using sachin now you are here and if you will do ls so there is nothing any file so in this way also you can add users okay so that's all for today's video guys i hope you liked it and if you have yeah if you have any queries then please you can ask us in the comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video with another concept so that's all so thank you thank you guys for watching this video and we'll meet in the next one thank you
