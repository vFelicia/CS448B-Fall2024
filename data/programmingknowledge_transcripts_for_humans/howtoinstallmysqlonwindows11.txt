03:21 - that this installer has been started and
03:24 - on this first window you will be asked
03:26 - to provide the setup type so there are
03:30 - few setup types which are available
03:33 - first one is developer which is default

03:52 - all the mysql products and features
03:56 - and the last one is
03:57 - the custom version which will allow you
04:00 - to manually select the product
04:02 - which should be installed right
04:04 - on the right hand side you can see the
04:06 - list of all the products which will be
04:09 - installed when you select
04:11 - some option
04:12 - we are going to choose the first option
04:14 - which is the developer default which
04:17 - comes with mysql server mysql shell
04:20 - router
04:21 - workbench
04:22 - and few other tools for

04:32 - tutorials
04:34 - so just select the default

04:41 - see check requirements window it says
04:43 - the following products have failing
04:45 - requirements mysql installer will
04:48 - attempt to resolve them automatically
04:51 - requirements mark as manual cannot be
04:54 - resolved automatically so if you want to
04:56 - use these tools for example mysql for
04:59 - visual studio or
05:02 - connector for python then you need to
05:04 - fulfill these two uh
05:06 - requirements right but in our case we
05:09 - just want to use mysql server and mysql
05:12 - workbench to learn and to feel how mysql
05:16 - works right so
05:18 - for uh the beginners these requirements
05:20 - will
05:21 - not be required but
05:23 - later if you need them you can always
05:26 - install python or visual studio on your
05:29 - windows 11 operating system
05:31 - so i don't want to
05:33 - use for now the connector or visual
05:36 - studio for mysql so i'm going to just
05:39 - click on next here and then it says one
05:41 - or more product requirement has not been
05:43 - uh satisfied it's okay for me so i'm
05:46 - going to click on yes here
05:48 - and then you will see the list of all
05:50 - the

06:07 - front of it
06:09 - and also you will be able to see the
06:11 - progress
06:12 - of the installation so you can see this
06:14 - check mark is added so i'm going to wait
06:16 - for this check mark to appear in front
06:19 - of each and every tool here so now i can
06:21 - see green check mark in front of each
06:24 - and every tool that means everything is
06:27 - installed so i can click on the next
06:29 - button so on this next page you will be
06:32 - able to see the product configuration
06:34 - page you just need to click on next on
06:37 - this and here you can see type and
06:40 - networking
06:41 - so just leave everything as default here
06:44 - so the config type is a development
06:46 - computer and the tcp ip port is 3306
06:51 - which is the default port
06:53 - and then open windows firewall port for
06:56 - network access so i'm going to leave
06:58 - everything as default and then click on
07:00 - next
07:02 - and here authentication method use
07:05 - storage password encryption for
07:07 - authentication which is recommended i'm

07:20 - the password for different roles right
07:23 - so root account password we need to give
07:26 - here

07:29 - password which i can remember
07:31 - and you might want to choose stronger
07:34 - password but for now i just want to use
07:37 - a simple password for this demonstration
07:40 - and then once you are done with
07:43 - the root password you can also create
07:45 - different users
07:47 - for your mysql database for example i
07:50 - can just click on this add user button
07:53 - and then add a user for example code
07:55 - bind in my case you can name it anything
07:59 - you want right now the host name will be

08:14 - and then you can choose the password for
08:16 - that user i'm going to choose once again
08:18 - a very simple password but you might
08:21 - want to
08:22 - choose a strong password here click on
08:24 - ok and then click on next
08:28 - and at this point windows services i'm
08:31 - going to leave everything as default and
08:33 - then click on next
08:35 - and then i'm going to click on execute
08:37 - which is going to
08:39 - apply all the configurations here and
08:42 - once that's done you can see all the
08:44 - configurations are successfully applied
08:46 - at this point i can just click on finish
08:49 - and then click on next here
08:52 - and you will be able to see uh this
08:54 - window where it says mysql router
08:57 - configuration so on this uh window you
09:00 - can see mysql router configuration
09:02 - bootstrap mysql router
09:04 - for use with innodb cluster i don't want
09:07 - to use it for now so i'm going to just
09:09 - click on finish
09:11 - and then click on next
09:13 - and then
09:14 - here you can see the username
09:17 - and then i can provide the password here
09:20 - and then click on check and you can see
09:23 - connection is successful with the mysql
09:25 - server
09:26 - so
09:27 - this is the password which i have set
09:29 - previously right so you need to provide
09:31 - that password here and you can check it
09:34 - once that's done click on next and then
09:36 - click on execute and once you see uh
09:39 - that this process is completed
09:41 - successfully you can click on finish and
09:44 - then once again click on next here so on
09:46 - this window you can see installation
09:48 - complete the installation procedure has
09:50 - been completed so you can click on this
09:52 - uh
09:53 - button to copy the logs to the clipboard
09:56 - and when you leave these checkboxes as
09:58 - checked they are going to start the
10:01 - mysql workbench after the setup and
10:04 - mysql shell after the setup so i'm going
10:07 - to just click on finish which is going
10:09 - to launch mysql workbench and mysql
10:13 - shell
10:15 - so you can see my sql workbench has been
10:18 - started and mysql shell has been started
10:21 - if you close these
10:24 - tools you can always open these tools by
10:27 - clicking on the windows start icon and
10:29 - then click on all apps here
10:31 - and then just scroll down a little
10:35 - where you will find mysql and from here
10:37 - you can open mysql of workbench mysql
10:40 - shell
10:41 - and
10:42 - the other utilities from here right so
10:46 - as you can see the mysql shell has been
10:49 - started so here i can give you commands
10:51 - for example backslash
10:54 - help and then press enter which is going
10:56 - to show me
10:58 - uh what are
10:59 - the commands which i can use most
11:02 - important one is connect and disconnect
11:05 - i can exit by using this
11:07 - option
11:08 - and you can see quit
11:10 - python
11:12 - show so there are different commands
11:14 - here right so for example when i type
11:16 - backslash connect here and then press
11:19 - enter it's going to show me how can i
11:21 - use this connect command right so these
11:24 - are the arguments which i can provide
11:26 - for the connect command and then i can
11:28 - provide the uri right so let's try this
11:31 - so i'm going to just type connect space
11:35 - root which is my username at the rate
11:38 - local
11:39 - host
11:40 - which is the host on which mysql is
11:43 - running and then the default port which
11:45 - is 3306
11:47 - so this 3306 is the default port of
11:51 - mysql
11:52 - then press enter and you can see
11:54 - creating a session to
11:56 - this uri and it requires the password so
12:00 - this password you need to provide which
12:02 - you have set at the time of installation
12:04 - right
12:05 - so you need to remember that password so
12:07 - i'm going to provide that password and
12:09 - then press enter
12:10 - and then you can see it's asking me to
12:13 - save the password i will just
12:16 - type
12:17 - y here and then press enter which is
12:19 - going to save my password so now
12:22 - i'm
12:23 - connected to localhost 3306
12:27 - or i just want to use the show command
12:30 - so i can just type show and it shows me
12:33 - available reports query threads and
12:36 - thread i can just write backslash
12:39 - use and the name of my database my db
12:43 - for example and then press enter and if
12:45 - this database is present then it's going
12:47 - to use that database
12:50 - so this is how you can work with this
12:53 - mysql shell
12:55 - you can also use mysql workbench as i
12:59 - have mentioned right so you can click on
13:02 - uh
13:03 - local instance
13:04 - this one or you can click on this
13:06 - database option and then click on
13:08 - connect to database
13:11 - and from here you can choose the
13:13 - hostname port name and then
13:16 - the
13:17 - username from here and then you can
13:19 - click on store in vault and then
13:22 - i'm going to just give the password for
13:25 - my root user which i have set at the
13:27 - time of installation and then click on
13:29 - ok
13:30 - and then click on ok here which is going
13:33 - to connect to
13:34 - my
13:35 - mysql server and you will be able to see
13:38 - uh this kind of interface here so here
13:42 - you can see the schemas here there are
13:45 - three schemas available
13:47 - sakila sys and volt so here if i have
13:51 - written instead of my db i can just try
13:55 - to use
13:57 - world which is the default database
13:59 - which comes with the installation
14:02 - you can see default schema set to world
14:05 - right
14:06 - so this is how i can use the shell
14:09 - if i want to
14:10 - just see the tables inside this world
14:12 - database i can click on this expand
14:15 - icon here and then see all the tables
14:18 - here and then i can also click on the
14:21 - table here and see all the columns right
14:24 - so i can right click here
14:26 - and then select
14:28 - rows which is going to select
14:30 - the top hundred rows and show you the
14:33 - result you can see
14:35 - the
14:36 - table result is shown here query is
14:39 - shown here so from the next time you can
14:41 - work with your queries and see the
14:44 - result here
14:45 - and you can see the output also here
14:48 - right so this is how you can download
14:50 - and install and use mysql database on
14:52 - your windows 11 operating system
