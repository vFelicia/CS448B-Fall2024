02:58 - by name okay that's it and as you can
03:06 - see II it is sorted and it will any
03:12 - displays the name alphabetically first a
03:17 - LX l XB c e l am i now i want to sort it
03:27 - a salty table according to this roll
03:30 - number okay so we just write roll number
03:36 - here as you can see so by default it's
03:46 - sorted a ascending order and but if we
03:51 - want to sort it in descending order then
03:54 - we can also do that we just need to
03:57 - specify the ESC keyboard now you can see
04:08 - we can also give multiple column names
04:13 - in order by field let's say a roll
04:17 - number and name okay so as you can see
04:30 - so let's just close it open MySQL but
04:38 - match
04:55 - okay so select star from that's so done
05:06 - where roll number is greater than 14 and
05:17 - we want to order by using roll number
05:25 - itself let's say okay
05:29 - as you can see 15 comes first 16 17 and
05:35 - 18 now we want it in descending order so
05:40 - just write de st and you can see 18 17
05:50 - 16 15 now I wanted to short according to
05:57 - its surname
06:08 - as you can see it is alphabetically let
06:18 - us try one more example select only name
06:27 - from student the roll number is less
06:42 - than or equal to 15 order by rollin but
06:54 - let's say here you can see Elizabeth ma
07:07 - let us okay
07:08 - let us open one more SQL okay so you can
07:22 - match select star from student okay now
07:35 - you can see Elizabeth has roll number
07:37 - two mark has five bridging adds 10 3 2
07:50 - 11 and so on if we're descending and it
08:02 - is so named in descending order
08:07 - okay really
08:10 - you can see he has the highest number
08:14 - roll number 15 which we specified here
08:18 - and it comes first because we have
08:21 - by descending order you okay so there's
08:25 - our you can display your records in
08:28 - ascending and descending order
