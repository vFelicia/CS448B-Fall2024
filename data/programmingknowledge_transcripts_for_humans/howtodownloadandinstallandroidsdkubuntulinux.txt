00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can install Android SDK
00:05 - on your Ubuntu operating system so let's
00:08 - download Android SDK uh kit first so
00:13 - just write in your favorite uh search
00:16 - engine Android SDK and search for it and
00:19 - the first link you will find here is
00:22 - developer.android.com SDK
00:25 - index.html just click this link here and
00:28 - you will see here
00:30 - different flavors of uh Android SDK
00:35 - bundles it's available for Windows 32bit
00:38 - Windows 64bit Mac OS Linux 32bit and
00:43 - Linux 64bit and one we are interested is
00:48 - in is Linux
00:49 - 32bit because I have 32bit OS type
00:53 - that's why I'm downloading 32bit uh
00:56 - bundle but if you have Linux 64-bit just
00:59 - click click this uh 64bit bundle
01:04 - here so just click this 32bit and in
01:08 - here it will show terms and condition
01:11 - you can read them and just click this I
01:15 - have uh read and agreed the terms and
01:17 - condition and just click this download
01:18 - button so I have already downloaded uh
01:21 - this ZIP file so I uh I'm not
01:24 - downloading it for the second time but
01:26 - just click this and it will take about 1
01:28 - minute uh
01:30 - to download because it's a relatively
01:33 - Big File about 500 MB and once this file
01:37 - is downloaded in your system it will uh
01:40 - look like this ZIP file
01:43 - okay so what we are going to do is we
01:46 - are going to just double click this div
01:48 - zip file from
01:49 - here and we are going to extract this
01:52 - file so just click this extract button
01:54 - and just extract this file in some
01:57 - specified folder so I have already made
01:59 - made this Android STK folder here but if
02:02 - you don't have this folder just create
02:04 - one for you and give it a name and just
02:07 - go inside this folder and click this
02:09 - extract button so your uh ZIP file will
02:12 - be extracted in that Android SDK folder
02:15 - okay now in order to run Android apps
02:18 - you need to install uh JRE and
02:22 - jdk so to install j and jdk we will open
02:27 - our terminal
02:28 - first and in here we will give this
02:33 - command so just give pseudo app minus
02:36 - get install open jdk - 7us j e space
02:41 - open jdk - 7us jdk and space I plugin so
02:46 - we are also going to install I plugin so
02:49 - just give I minus 7 minus plugin so just
02:53 - give this command in order to install
02:54 - jdk and JRE and IC plugin in your system
02:58 - which will help you to run and develop
03:02 - compile Android apps and press enter and
03:06 - right now I can see that I have already
03:08 - installed these
03:10 - uh I plugin and JDR in my system that's
03:14 - why showing the message that this plugin
03:17 - is already in the newest form but for
03:20 - the first time uh when you are
03:22 - installing in uh this these uh uh jdk in
03:27 - your system you need to give your
03:28 - password because you are using pseudo
03:31 - and you need to just uh give some uh yes
03:35 - commands uh to just complete the or
03:40 - finish the installation once you have
03:43 - finished this installation and once you
03:45 - have extracted this uh file in your
03:49 - specified folder in my case Android SDK
03:52 - just go to that extracted file and you
03:54 - will find two folder here one is SDK
03:58 - which contains uh tools and platform
04:01 - tools and Extras and build tools here
04:05 - and other is the Eclipse IDE so just go
04:11 - to this Eclipse folder here and in here
04:13 - you will find an executable table
04:16 - executable called Eclipse here so just
04:19 - double click this Eclipse
04:25 - executable and for the first time when
04:27 - you are uh running this Eclipse IDE you
04:32 - it will ask you to uh Define the default
04:35 - workspace workspace is nothing but uh
04:38 - the space where it saves your project so
04:41 - the default workspace is home/ 2/
04:45 - workspace but you can change this
04:47 - workspace by browsing your specified
04:50 - location and click
04:56 - okay and now this EX DK has started and
05:01 - it will give this popup for contributing
05:06 - contribute user Statics to Google if you
05:09 - agree to it just give your statistics or
05:13 - if you don't just give no and
05:16 - finish and now you
05:19 - can develop new Android apps in
05:24 - this Eclipse ID so when you want to uh
05:29 - create create some new app just go to
05:31 - new and create Android application
05:34 - project and give it a
05:37 - name
05:39 - test and click next
05:44 - next and
