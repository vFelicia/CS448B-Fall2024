00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - node.js tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how to use pipes
00:06 - to serve your text which you are reading
00:10 - from our text file to a browser for
00:12 - example and we have learned some
00:15 - concepts about pipes now let's use this
00:19 - concept to serve a HTML page to a
00:22 - browser for example so let's get started
00:25 - and first of all we are going to create
00:27 - an HTML page so I'm going to right click
00:29 - and I'm going to name my HTML page as
00:33 - index dot HTML ok so just create a page
00:37 - called index dot HTML and in here we are
00:42 - going to write our HTML code okay
00:45 - so let's add our HTML tag first of all
00:49 - and then we are going to add head and
00:53 - body elements so just add head first and
01:00 - let's add a body element also and inside
01:09 - this body let's write something so
01:12 - inside the body for example I want to
01:14 - add a h1 tag and in this h1 tags let's
01:19 - write something so for example or first
01:27 - node.js HTML page for example okay and
01:34 - let's give some style to this page for
01:38 - example let's add first of all the style
01:41 - element here instead of this just write
01:45 - style and then inside the style let's
01:49 - change the background color of our
01:52 - webpage so we can just do it by just
01:56 - changing the background color of the
02:00 - body so just add body here and we will
02:06 - change the background color right so
02:09 - just choose background
02:11 - kalo and which color we want for example
02:17 - light green or something like this so
02:20 - let's use light green is there any light
02:25 - green here here this okay right so this
02:31 - is essentially changing the background
02:33 - color of your HTML page and it has one
02:36 - h1 element which has some text here okay
02:40 - now because it's in the same folder as
02:43 - our project file so we don't need to
02:45 - worry about any path here and instead of
02:48 - this file dot txt we can just write
02:51 - index dot HTML okay so just write index
02:56 - dot HTML and instead of plain text slash
03:01 - plain here now we are sending the HTML
03:04 - content to the browser so just replace
03:07 - this plane by HTML here okay
03:10 - and we will be good to go so let's rerun
03:15 - our saga so I'm going to rerun our
03:17 - server and let's refresh our page and
03:22 - now we have our first HTML page solved
03:26 - using our node.js over to the browser
03:30 - right so this is not really complicated
03:34 - and if you want to make a static website
03:38 - you can add multiple you know static
03:42 - HTML page pages and serve it using this
03:46 - technique but no chase is much more
03:49 - advanced and the complex technology and
03:52 - it can be used to you know do more
03:55 - complex stuff right so this is the
03:59 - simple way of just catering an HTML page
04:02 - toward the browser in the further videos
04:04 - we will see how we can use some more
04:07 - complex functionality with no GS I hope
04:09 - you've enjoyed this video please welcome
04:11 - and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use pipes to serve your text which you are reading from our text file to a browser for example and we have learned some concepts about pipes now let's use this concept to serve a HTML page to a browser for example so let's get started and first of all we are going to create an HTML page so I'm going to right click and I'm going to name my HTML page as index dot HTML ok so just create a page called index dot HTML and in here we are going to write our HTML code okay so let's add our HTML tag first of all and then we are going to add head and body elements so just add head first and let's add a body element also and inside this body let's write something so inside the body for example I want to add a h1 tag and in this h1 tags let's write something so for example or first node.js HTML page for example okay and let's give some style to this page for example let's add first of all the style element here instead of this just write style and then inside the style let's change the background color of our webpage so we can just do it by just changing the background color of the body so just add body here and we will change the background color right so just choose background kalo and which color we want for example light green or something like this so let's use light green is there any light green here here this okay right so this is essentially changing the background color of your HTML page and it has one h1 element which has some text here okay now because it's in the same folder as our project file so we don't need to worry about any path here and instead of this file dot txt we can just write index dot HTML okay so just write index dot HTML and instead of plain text slash plain here now we are sending the HTML content to the browser so just replace this plane by HTML here okay and we will be good to go so let's rerun our saga so I'm going to rerun our server and let's refresh our page and now we have our first HTML page solved using our node.js over to the browser right so this is not really complicated and if you want to make a static website you can add multiple you know static HTML page pages and serve it using this technique but no chase is much more advanced and the complex technology and it can be used to you know do more complex stuff right so this is the simple way of just catering an HTML page toward the browser in the further videos we will see how we can use some more complex functionality with no GS I hope you've enjoyed this video please welcome and subscribe and bye for now
