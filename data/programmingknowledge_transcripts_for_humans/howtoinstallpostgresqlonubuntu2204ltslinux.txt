00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:05 - use postgresql on your Ubuntu operating
00:07 - system so let's get started and let's
00:09 - see how we can do it
00:11 - so first of all open your favorite
00:13 - browser and search for install post gray
00:15 - and the first link which will appear
00:17 - here will be from
00:19 - postgray.org so I'm going to click on
00:21 - this link which is postcode.org
00:26 - now if you uh land to the home page you
00:30 - can directly click on the download
00:32 - button here or click on download link
00:34 - here
00:35 - now we will choose our operating system
00:39 - which is Linux
00:41 - and then from here I can choose the
00:44 - distribution which is Ubuntu
00:46 - and I will be redirected to this Ubuntu
00:50 - installation page right
00:52 - I can scroll down a bit and then I can
00:57 - install
00:58 - the poster SQL using all these commands
01:03 - right
01:04 - so let me uh copy these commands one by
01:08 - one and then
01:09 - try to execute them on my terminal so if
01:14 - you don't know how to open the terminal
01:16 - you can just press Ctrl alt T to open
01:19 - the terminal or you can go to the
01:21 - applications and click on this terminal
01:23 - option and it's going to open the new
01:25 - terminal
01:26 - so let me give the First Command here
01:28 - which is this one and then press enter
01:31 - and give your ubuntu's password
01:34 - and this command is successful let's
01:37 - give the second command which is to
01:38 - import the repository signing key
01:42 - I'm going to just give this command and
01:44 - then press enter and that's also
01:46 - successful
01:47 - let's update the package list by giving
01:51 - this sudo apt-cat update you can also
01:55 - give sudo apt update command and it will
01:59 - also be successful hopefully right
02:03 - now let's give the next command
02:06 - I am going to just copy this command and
02:09 - then just paste it and then press enter
02:13 - and
02:14 - this command is also
02:17 - installing the postgresql so just wait
02:19 - for some time so now you can see this
02:22 - command is successfully executed and
02:25 - hopefully the post gray SQL is installed
02:27 - on my Ubuntu operating system now let me
02:30 - clear the terminal once this post gray
02:33 - SQL is installed hopefully the server is
02:35 - already started
02:37 - so we can just start using the psql
02:42 - client in order to interact with the
02:45 - post tray right so just give this uh
02:48 - command which is going to switch to the
02:51 - postcreate user and then we can use the
02:54 - psql command so just give sudo hyphen I
02:57 - hyphen U and then post
03:01 - Grace here okay and then press enter
03:05 - and you are switched to the postcreate
03:09 - user now you can see
03:11 - earlier it was the code bind user right
03:15 - now just give psql command p s q l and
03:20 - then press enter and now you are inside
03:24 - the post click line using psql
03:27 - now let me show you how you can exit
03:30 - from this uh PA post gray client you can
03:35 - just give backlash queue and then press
03:38 - enter and you come out of this psql
03:42 - shell but you are still
03:45 - logged in with your post gray user right
03:49 - create a new database you can just
03:54 - go to your pro screen user or you can
03:57 - switch to the postcreate user and then
04:01 - give this command which is create DB and
04:04 - your DB name so I can just say my
04:09 - PG DB this is the database name I want
04:15 - to create right press enter and it's
04:17 - going to create a new database in order
04:20 - to switch to this database I can give
04:23 - this command psql and then hyphen D and
04:28 - then the name of the database which is
04:30 - my pgdb and then press enter and you are
04:34 - switched into the new database which you
04:38 - have created right
04:39 - you can give a backslash
04:43 - con info to get the information about
04:46 - the connection I can just give
04:48 - con
04:49 - info here and it says you are connected
04:53 - to the database my
04:56 - pgdb which I have created
04:58 - as a user postgray right I'm logged in
05:01 - with the postgrad user wire socket this
05:05 - one and it's running on this port right
05:08 - so everything is working fine here and
05:12 - now I can create a table here using
05:16 - Create table command and start using
05:19 - this psql now uh this command shell is
05:24 - good
05:25 - if you are a fan of command line
05:28 - tool but some user prefers the graphical
05:32 - user interface to interact with the
05:35 - postgresql in that case you can install
05:38 - the official PG admin tool which is a
05:42 - GUI application which you can use as a
05:46 - client to interact with your postgresql
05:48 - to install PG admin on your Ubuntu
05:51 - operating system you can go to your
05:54 - favorite browser once again and then
05:55 - search for install PG admin and the
05:58 - first link which will appear here will
05:59 - be from PG admin.org so I'm going to
06:02 - click on this link here
06:05 - and straight away I can see this
06:08 - download button click on that
06:10 - and then I can scroll down and then here
06:13 - I can choose what do I want right so I
06:18 - am on Ubuntu so here I will use this apt
06:23 - command so I'm going to click on apt
06:25 - here
06:27 - and then you can see
06:30 - all these uh Debian related uh
06:33 - distributions here so for me I want to
06:36 - install Ubuntu form my uh
06:39 - 22.04 uh operating system so you can see
06:45 - it will work for all these platforms
06:47 - right
06:48 - so here these are the commands to
06:51 - install PG admin so let's execute them
06:55 - one by one so this is the first command
06:57 - let me open the terminal let me open the
07:01 - next tab in the terminal and then paste
07:04 - this First Command which is the curl
07:06 - command and then you can see the curl is
07:09 - not found on my system right so in order
07:12 - to install curl I can use snap or I can
07:16 - even use the apt to install curl for now
07:20 - I'm going to give this uh
07:22 - sudo apt installed curl command so I'm
07:25 - going to just give sudo apt
07:28 - install
07:30 - curl and then press enter give my
07:34 - ubuntu's password which is going to
07:36 - install the curl right curl is the
07:39 - utility which you can use to download
07:43 - some packages so once curl is installed
07:48 - I'm going to clear the terminal copy the
07:50 - First Command once again from here and
07:53 - paste it in my terminal which is the
07:55 - curl command and now it's successful
07:59 - once that's done I can copy the second
08:03 - command which is to create the
08:05 - repository configuration file and paste
08:08 - it to into the terminal press enter
08:10 - it will also be successful
08:14 - once that's done
08:16 - it's the time to install PG admin at the
08:19 - time of making this video the PG admin 4
08:22 - is the latest version I'm going to just
08:23 - copy this command and then paste it here
08:26 - and then press enter
08:28 - and then press Y and then press enter
08:31 - which is going to start installing PG
08:33 - admin
08:34 - let's see if there is any other command
08:37 - you have this option to install the PG
08:42 - admin desktop also you have the option
08:45 - to install PG admin web right so if you
08:49 - want to install both you can give both
08:51 - these commands also for the
08:55 - configuration for the PG admin web you
08:59 - can give this command also so we are
09:01 - going to give all these commands one by
09:03 - one once that previous command is
09:06 - successful okay so this previous command
09:09 - is successful so we are going to give
09:11 - the next command to install the PG admin
09:14 - desktop and then press enter
09:17 - and that is done so now I can give the
09:21 - next command to install the PG admin web
09:25 - and then press enter
09:27 - and that's also done and then we can
09:30 - just execute this
09:32 - sh script to configure the web interface
09:38 - I can give the email address for now and
09:43 - then the password I'm going to give a
09:46 - very simple password here to remember
09:49 - the login right so just remember that
09:53 - password which you have given retype the
09:55 - password
09:57 - and it should be six characters so let
10:00 - me give the six character password
10:03 - retype it
10:05 - and hopefully that will be successful
10:07 - and then press y here
10:10 - and then press Y and everything is
10:14 - successful so now I can open the PG
10:17 - admin on my browser using this link
10:19 - you can just click on this link or you
10:23 - can copy this link and paste it into
10:25 - your terminals right
10:27 - so
10:29 - you can see the PG admin is starting on
10:33 - my web browser
10:35 - you need to give the same
10:37 - email and password which you have given
10:40 - at the time of configuration right which
10:42 - is given here right I have given this
10:45 - email and the password right so let me
10:49 - just copy this email
10:51 - by the way this is uh
10:54 - fake email which I have given so if you
10:57 - want to send me an email it will not
10:59 - reach me if you send me on this email
11:03 - and then I'm going to give the password
11:05 - and then click on login
11:07 - and I'm logged in to my PG admin you can
11:12 - see
11:13 - now let's try to open the PG admin
11:16 - desktop application just go to the
11:19 - applications and then search for PG
11:21 - admin and then click on this PG admin
11:24 - desktop and it will also start right
11:27 - so let's open this desktop version both
11:29 - look similar you can see right so you
11:32 - can use either of them
11:36 - to register a server you can just right
11:40 - click on server and then click on
11:41 - register and then click on uh server
11:44 - let's connect to the localhost so it's
11:48 - 127.0.0.1
11:52 - the default Port is 5432 for the Post
11:57 - tray right as you might remember
12:00 - here by the way I need to give the name
12:02 - I can give any name here for now I'm
12:05 - going to give localhost so that I can
12:08 - remember which server is this here I
12:11 - need to give 127.0.0.1
12:14 - which is localhost as you might remember
12:18 - we have logged into uh or PG
12:23 - psql shell using this username which is
12:27 - postgres right now the password Here I
12:30 - haven't set any and by default the
12:33 - password is post gray here right so give
12:36 - this password here which is postcreate
12:38 - and if it fails let's try to set a
12:42 - password so go to your terminal
12:45 - and here once again I'm going to switch
12:47 - to the post gray username and then I can
12:51 - give the psql command here right so
12:55 - either you can give this psql command or
12:59 - you can give the create DB command as I
13:03 - said to create the DB here you can
13:06 - change the default password by giving
13:09 - this backslash password command so I'm
13:12 - going to just give backslash password
13:14 - and then space I'm going to just raise s
13:18 - t e and then press enter
13:20 - and then I can give the password for
13:24 - this sde user right but I haven't
13:27 - created any sde user I want to do this
13:32 - for the postcreate user right so let me
13:35 - just
13:37 - once again give this command and then
13:41 - so because I'm giving the postcreate
13:43 - user name here I need to give password
13:46 - for the postgrey user so just give
13:50 - backslash postgrad here and then give
13:53 - the new password I'm going to set the
13:55 - very simple password Here
13:58 - and then retype it again and then press
14:01 - enter and it's set and let me just try
14:05 - that password here which I have set and
14:09 - then press save and now it works right
14:12 - so in order to change the password for
14:15 - post way you can give this command and
14:17 - give your password and remember that
14:20 - password and use the same password in
14:22 - order to connect to your localhost
14:26 - server for post tray user
14:30 - now you can create all these databases
14:33 - this database we have created using the
14:36 - command line right so you have this
14:39 - database and then here you can create
14:42 - the schemas and tables and other things
14:47 - so this is how you can install
14:48 - postgresql
14:50 - and PG admin on your Ubuntu operating
14:53 - system I hope you've enjoyed this video
14:55 - and I will see you in the next video
