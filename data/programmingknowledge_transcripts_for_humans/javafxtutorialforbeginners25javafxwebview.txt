00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fixed roll for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will learn about using webview
00:06 - in Java FX webview you can use to
00:11 - display some web pages on your JavaFX
00:14 - application or even you can use you know
00:18 - your own HTML code to display in the web
00:23 - view ok so it can be a static file which
00:27 - you have created in the HTML and you can
00:29 - you know just call this file and load
00:33 - this HTML file using webview
00:36 - ok so I have this simple project created
00:41 - which is a webview and in the
00:44 - application package I have this main dot
00:47 - Java file in which I was calling this
00:50 - main dot affectional file which I have
00:53 - created which is right now blank and I
00:56 - have this main controller dot Java class
00:59 - which is also blank so I will start with
01:02 - this main controller dot Java class
01:04 - first of all I will implement here the
01:07 - initialize able interface and then I
01:11 - will just add the unhandled method or
01:14 - unimplemented method which is initialize
01:17 - here and first of all what I'm going to
01:21 - do is I'm going to add a web view
01:25 - control here so I will just write at the
01:28 - rate FX ml then private web view and
01:38 - then just give the name to your web
01:41 - views for example web view itself ok and
01:47 - then we are going to declare one more
01:50 - variable which is called a web engine so
01:53 - you are going to you know load this web
01:57 - view using web engine so just declare
02:02 - this variable private web engine and
02:08 - just name it for example
02:12 - engine itself and then what you can do
02:15 - is take your engine variable and put it
02:19 - inside your initialized method and then
02:22 - is equal to take your webview variable
02:26 - and then get engine and this is going to
02:30 - you know load the engine for the webview
02:33 - okay and then you can use this engine to
02:36 - load a different type type of web
02:39 - content okay so now what I'm going to do
02:42 - is I'm going to declare some more method
02:45 - and this will be the button click method
02:49 - to load some pages okay so first button
02:54 - method name I'm going to name it as BTN
02:57 - one and here I will just add action
03:01 - perform event and inside the math heard
03:07 - what I'm going to do here is I'm going
03:09 - to take this engine variable and then
03:12 - I'm going to call load and here you can
03:16 - provide a string and you can give the
03:20 - URL of some website for example HTTP
03:24 - colon slash slash www.google.com and
03:30 - what it's going to do is it's going to
03:33 - load this URL on your web view okay in
03:38 - the same way you can declare some more
03:42 - method for example I'm going to declare
03:44 - for button click method and I'm going to
03:47 - name them as button to button three and
03:51 - button 4 okay now you can also use this
03:58 - web view and engine to perform some
04:01 - JavaScript tasks so how you can do it
04:05 - you can just take your engine variable
04:07 - and then you can just call a method
04:11 - called execute script here and it takes
04:14 - the string in which you can perform some
04:17 - JavaScript tasks for example I will
04:19 - redirect this page to some other URL
04:24 - write something like
04:25 - so just write in double code window dot
04:28 - location is equal to backslash in the
04:32 - codes HTTP colon slash slash the web URL
04:37 - which you want to open for example some
04:39 - website name then once again forward
04:43 - slash two times and back slash and
04:45 - double quote close and this semicolon
04:48 - something like this okay so this is
04:51 - going to you know redirect this page to
04:54 - this URL okay you can also use this
04:58 - engine variable to load some HTML
05:02 - content so you can just call a method
05:04 - called load content here and you can add
05:08 - some HTML code inside this these double
05:10 - quotes you can also import a HTML file
05:14 - content here and pass it as an argument
05:17 - but for example I will just write this
05:20 - small HTML code here which prints hello
05:23 - world and it's going to print hello
05:27 - world using the HTML code right or
05:30 - otherwise if you want to read load your
05:32 - page what you can do is you can just
05:35 - write engine dot reload okay there are
05:40 - some more interesting method which you
05:42 - can use using this engine for example
05:46 - you can just search for a method which
05:49 - suits your requirement for example get
05:52 - histories one interesting method here
05:56 - and get location get on alert so many
06:00 - method here which you can call so just
06:03 - experiment with these methods and see
06:07 - what suits your requirements right these
06:10 - are just small examples I'm going to
06:13 - show you how you can work with web view
06:17 - okay so now our code is done so we are
06:19 - going to open our main dot F XML file
06:22 - and open with scene builder and just
06:26 - select your end cap in and then resize
06:29 - your end cap in so go to the layout here
06:33 - and for example I want to give the prep
06:37 - size of 800
06:39 - and prep width of 600 right so here what
06:45 - you can do is you can go to the controls
06:47 - and then take web view from here and
06:50 - drag and drop here okay and we are also
06:54 - going to take four buttons so button one
06:57 - button two and button 4 ok and I'm going
07:06 - to quickly change the text of this
07:08 - button for example this is for loading
07:12 - the page this is for for example
07:16 - executing the Java Script third is for
07:21 - executing our HTML code so I will just
07:24 - write HTML and the fourth button is to
07:29 - reload so I will just write reload ok
07:33 - and then select your first button and go
07:37 - to the code here and then select your
07:40 - method which you have defined right so
07:43 - the first method which we have defined
07:45 - here is button 1 right but first of all
07:50 - what we are going to do is we are going
07:51 - to you know connect our controller with
07:54 - the main dot affectional file so go to
07:57 - the controller here and select
07:59 - application dot mean controller and then
08:03 - once again select your first button go
08:06 - to the code and then select button 1
08:10 - from here then second button and then
08:12 - select button 2 method from you select
08:15 - third and select button 3 method from
08:18 - here and button 4 and select this button
08:22 - 4 method from here ok and then we are
08:27 - going to just resize our web view and we
08:31 - will go to the property here and in here
08:35 - there is an interesting property in
08:37 - layout which is anchor pane constraints
08:41 - ok and you will see this kind of square
08:45 - here so just give on the side 1 and at
08:50 - the top one
08:52 - and at the right hand side also one okay
08:55 - because we have button at the bottom so
08:59 - we are not going to give any value at
09:01 - the bottom here okay and press ENTER and
09:04 - then save your code and then refresh
09:08 - your webpage and one more thing we want
09:12 - to do here is we want to you know add
09:15 - this webview ID to the F XML page so
09:19 - just go to F XML and select your webview
09:23 - here
09:23 - and then go to the code and just give
09:27 - this ID webview here okay
09:30 - save your code and refresh your webpage
09:34 - and then run it so now my application is
09:39 - running and when I press this load
09:43 - button it's going to open this
09:47 - google.com website and then what I'm
09:52 - going to do is I'm going to press the
09:54 - second button and it's going to open
09:57 - this second website here right and then
10:01 - I'm going to open the third button which
10:04 - prints hello world using HTML and it
10:08 - prints successfully once again I will go
10:11 - to the load button and press it it opens
10:14 - the google.com and then I press a reload
10:17 - button so it reloads the page okay so
10:21 - JavaScript HTML and then load and reload
10:28 - okay so in this way you can use a
10:31 - webview in
10:32 - JavaFX I hope you've enjoyed this video

10:37 - for now
