With timestamps:

00:01 - so i think
00:04 - it is not settings
00:06 - i don't know why it is giving an error
00:08 - let's see how we did it earlier so in
00:10 - the product screen we took the seller so
00:13 - we just need to give a semi uh question
00:16 - ma exclamation mark over there
00:19 - okay so uh in development it is not
00:22 - necessary that you know everything it is
00:24 - how you learn
00:26 - okay so now that we have the product
00:28 - over here instead of giving that i can
00:31 - simply write
00:32 - product dot
00:35 - its name so now that we have we are
00:38 - coming from cucumber it should be
00:41 - cucumber i think we need i need to give
00:44 - an exclamation mark over here
00:46 - let me format it let's save it and we
00:49 - have cucumber over here
00:51 - so this is fine
00:54 - now
00:57 - how to change this icon so there is a
01:01 - name i am not remembering it so what
01:04 - i'll do is i'll check all the options
01:05 - that we have
01:08 - okay one thing that we can change for
01:10 - now is the background color let's take
01:11 - the background color from here okay
01:14 - let's go and design
01:16 - and this is the background color
01:18 - okay let me copy it
01:21 - okay
01:22 - then we go back in our code
01:25 - and over here i add
01:27 - color
01:28 - then
01:29 - 0 x ff for opacity
01:33 - and then the color code
01:34 - okay
01:35 - let's save this and see
01:37 - so we have the color and
01:39 - we can remove this color from here for
01:42 - now we don't need it
01:44 - because since we have other items we
01:46 - will be able to verify if it is
01:48 - working or not
01:51 - so we already have this back icon over
01:53 - here because we are using push named
01:56 - okay since we are using push named if we
01:58 - go back we can go from the screen it is
02:00 - coming so that is why back is possible
02:02 - and that is why flutter has
02:03 - automatically added a back icon over
02:06 - here now uh since i am running it on an
02:09 - ios simulator it is coming like this but
02:12 - if i would have been running running it
02:13 - on an android simulator it would have
02:15 - come like we have in our
02:18 - design okay so either we can leave it
02:21 - like that or we can change it i am gonna
02:24 - change it but
02:26 - that is like your choice what do you
02:28 - wanna do
02:36 - leading okay so leading is the widget
02:38 - that we
02:39 - leading is the named parameter that has
02:41 - a widget
02:42 - so i'll use the icon widget inside that
02:45 - icons
02:47 - enum and from that enum i'll take the
02:50 - back
02:52 - icon
02:53 - so let me see what are the
02:56 - back
03:02 - arrow okay so no
03:06 - arrow let's see what all arrows we have
03:08 - over here
03:12 - yeah so we just need the arrow back
03:14 - okay and it should be of color
03:17 - white
03:20 - color needs to be colors white
03:28 - okay and i need
03:30 - need
03:31 - to give a closing
03:33 - parenthesis over here let me format it i
03:36 - think it needs to go with a const
03:43 - so yes the warning is gone now i need to
03:46 - give a comma over here so it is the
03:49 - standard practice to give a comma if you
03:51 - have more than two
03:53 - named parameters or even unnamed
03:56 - parameters
03:57 - so construct a color for lower
04:00 - prefer const with a constant construct
04:04 - okay so let's add cost i will prefer
04:07 - const
04:09 - let's format it save it
04:12 - and yeah there we have it
04:15 - okay so now that we are
04:18 - done with this let's come to
04:21 - this section
04:23 - okay
04:25 - let me zoom it out a little bit yeah so
04:28 - first you can see we have this big image
04:31 - in the center so let's do that
04:34 - okay
04:35 - now inside body
04:37 - there will be a child
04:39 - the child is gonna be a image
04:43 - network
04:45 - because we have a image url now let me
04:48 - see how i am displaying the images over
04:50 - here yes so as i hoped there is a
04:54 - previous url okay so this is
04:56 - generally how i do it
04:59 - so i'll copy it from here paste it over
05:02 - here
05:04 - simple
05:06 - let me format it
05:08 - save it and it is
05:11 - in the corner so we don't want that
05:19 - okay now since
05:20 - the design is on
05:22 - broccoli i am gonna change the item as
05:25 - well to broccoli from cucumber okay so
05:28 - now that we have added an icon over here
05:31 - what we forgot was to
05:33 - add like action to it what will happen
05:36 - if i click on that icon so let's do that
05:39 - so again i'm gonna refractor it
05:42 - wrap it with a widget
05:44 - add
05:45 - gesture detector
05:48 - now you can also change this icon to an
05:50 - icon button widget but i prefer just
05:53 - your detector so it is
05:55 - your choice basically it is nothing more
05:57 - than that
05:58 - so on tap
06:02 - and on tap
06:04 - i want
06:05 - navigator
06:08 - navigator
06:09 - dot of context
06:12 - to pop
06:13 - i guess
06:16 - yes
06:16 - it is
06:18 - pop
06:20 - great
06:21 - so now this is done let me format it
06:24 - save it
06:26 - yes let's see if the back button works
06:28 - it works
06:29 - now where is broccoli so do we have
06:32 - broccoli yeah
06:35 - so now let's
06:37 - fix this
06:38 - so it is again over here giving a
06:41 - warning to maybe
06:44 - avoid unnecessary containers okay okay
06:48 - there is one okay then let's remove it
06:51 - for now
06:52 - we can always add it back when we need
06:55 - it
06:55 - so i am removing the container
06:58 - and the warning now let's
07:01 - see its height let's increase its height
07:04 - height is gonna be
07:06 - media query dot off context
07:11 - dot size
07:13 - and dot height
07:17 - into two by three so what i am doing is
07:20 - i am taking the entire screen size and
07:22 - then i am alerting two third of the
07:25 - screen size to this
07:27 - image so what this will so what this
07:29 - will do is whenever the screen size
07:32 - changes it will not impact how the image
07:35 - looks
07:36 - okay so that is why it is very important
07:38 - to use dynamic sizing
07:40 - over here so let me format it save it
07:45 - okay now i think we also have to
07:49 - like tell the image to expand and that
07:53 - is fit
07:55 - and the fit is
07:57 - again box fit
08:00 - dot
08:01 - cover i guess
08:04 - let's see
08:07 - yes so this is how we want it but the
08:10 - image is actually not very sharp it is
08:13 - very blunt so i will be updating the
08:15 - image images but for now like
08:18 - we can we understand the gist
08:20 - okay so i don't want it two by three
08:22 - that is way too big i don't have space
08:25 - for anything else
08:26 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
08:29 - change it to
08:32 - uh one by two
08:34 - okay so that will only be half of the
08:36 - space let's see
08:40 - or maybe one by three
08:44 - okay then again it is very small let's
08:46 - come back to one by two
08:48 - okay we are continuing with this for now
08:51 - we can again change it later
08:54 - okay so now in the design we have the
08:57 - image and then we have the
09:00 - price so let's add the price and now we
09:04 - again have to add back the container or
09:07 - better than container we simply start
09:09 - with adding a column
09:11 - and let's see if it is pushed to the top
09:13 - okay so what generally happens is that
09:15 - as soon as you add a column it is
09:18 - already in like top aligned so all the
09:20 - items that you might have had in the
09:22 - center will automatically be pushed to
09:24 - the top but since this is an image and
09:27 - it is kind of taking this much space
09:30 - so it is not being pushed okay you will
09:32 - understand what i'm trying to say as
09:33 - soon as i add the
09:35 - text
09:39 - okay and the text is gonna be
09:41 - our
09:43 - product
09:46 - dot price per kg
09:52 - okay
09:53 - okay so i don't think we need it over
09:56 - here we need it
09:58 - over here
10:05 - okay it is okay so basically the error
10:08 - is that
10:09 - it is uh integer so what i am gonna do
10:13 - is
10:14 - i'm gonna typecast it so what for that
10:18 - okay just give me a moment first i'll
10:21 - add it inside quotes then add curly
10:23 - braces in front of it
10:26 - and then add a dollar sign
10:28 - so now it is an integer but since it is
10:31 - inside quotes it will automatically be
10:32 - typecasted to a string
10:34 - so let me save this and you can see this
10:37 - much space is
10:39 - already left so what we can say is that
10:41 - the image is taking from this place till
10:44 - this place okay which is way too much of
10:48 - uh like size so we need to fix that so
10:51 - the
10:52 - solution is that we update the image
10:55 - actually
10:56 - and i think i'll do that and then
10:58 - continue with the video so
11:01 - hang on

Cleaned transcript:

so i think it is not settings i don't know why it is giving an error let's see how we did it earlier so in the product screen we took the seller so we just need to give a semi uh question ma exclamation mark over there okay so uh in development it is not necessary that you know everything it is how you learn okay so now that we have the product over here instead of giving that i can simply write product dot its name so now that we have we are coming from cucumber it should be cucumber i think we need i need to give an exclamation mark over here let me format it let's save it and we have cucumber over here so this is fine now how to change this icon so there is a name i am not remembering it so what i'll do is i'll check all the options that we have okay one thing that we can change for now is the background color let's take the background color from here okay let's go and design and this is the background color okay let me copy it okay then we go back in our code and over here i add color then 0 x ff for opacity and then the color code okay let's save this and see so we have the color and we can remove this color from here for now we don't need it because since we have other items we will be able to verify if it is working or not so we already have this back icon over here because we are using push named okay since we are using push named if we go back we can go from the screen it is coming so that is why back is possible and that is why flutter has automatically added a back icon over here now uh since i am running it on an ios simulator it is coming like this but if i would have been running running it on an android simulator it would have come like we have in our design okay so either we can leave it like that or we can change it i am gonna change it but that is like your choice what do you wanna do leading okay so leading is the widget that we leading is the named parameter that has a widget so i'll use the icon widget inside that icons enum and from that enum i'll take the back icon so let me see what are the back arrow okay so no arrow let's see what all arrows we have over here yeah so we just need the arrow back okay and it should be of color white color needs to be colors white okay and i need need to give a closing parenthesis over here let me format it i think it needs to go with a const so yes the warning is gone now i need to give a comma over here so it is the standard practice to give a comma if you have more than two named parameters or even unnamed parameters so construct a color for lower prefer const with a constant construct okay so let's add cost i will prefer const let's format it save it and yeah there we have it okay so now that we are done with this let's come to this section okay let me zoom it out a little bit yeah so first you can see we have this big image in the center so let's do that okay now inside body there will be a child the child is gonna be a image network because we have a image url now let me see how i am displaying the images over here yes so as i hoped there is a previous url okay so this is generally how i do it so i'll copy it from here paste it over here simple let me format it save it and it is in the corner so we don't want that okay now since the design is on broccoli i am gonna change the item as well to broccoli from cucumber okay so now that we have added an icon over here what we forgot was to add like action to it what will happen if i click on that icon so let's do that so again i'm gonna refractor it wrap it with a widget add gesture detector now you can also change this icon to an icon button widget but i prefer just your detector so it is your choice basically it is nothing more than that so on tap and on tap i want navigator navigator dot of context to pop i guess yes it is pop great so now this is done let me format it save it yes let's see if the back button works it works now where is broccoli so do we have broccoli yeah so now let's fix this so it is again over here giving a warning to maybe avoid unnecessary containers okay okay there is one okay then let's remove it for now we can always add it back when we need it so i am removing the container and the warning now let's see its height let's increase its height height is gonna be media query dot off context dot size and dot height into two by three so what i am doing is i am taking the entire screen size and then i am alerting two third of the screen size to this image so what this will so what this will do is whenever the screen size changes it will not impact how
