00:00 - now in this particular video I'll be
00:02 - talking about the break and continue
00:03 - okay so we will learn about these two
00:06 - keywords in our shell scripting so let
00:08 - me first create the file with their name
00:10 - like break
00:12 - and continue
00:15 - dot sh okay we are good to go
00:18 - let me add the c bank because without
00:21 - this we cannot run our script Okay so
00:24 - now let me just tell you the execution
00:26 - like what and what is this so let me
00:29 - first talk about the break okay so break
00:31 - is basically
00:33 - it breaks the
00:37 - sorry it oh what I'm doing here man it
00:41 - breaks it breaks the
00:44 - execution
00:47 - of a loop okay
00:49 - so basically it makes the execution of a
00:51 - loop and the continue is nothing but it
00:55 - skips
00:57 - the execution on some certain condition
01:01 - okay
01:03 - so we will do and do the Practical part
01:06 - of this so so break will basically it
01:09 - will break the execution and it will not
01:11 - to do the further operation but in
01:14 - continue it will execute but like it
01:16 - will skip that particular part okay so
01:19 - uh let me just start with the for Loop
01:21 - because we will be using the follow for
01:23 - the implementation break and continue
01:25 - and also you can use while loop also
01:27 - it's all upon you
01:28 - so I will simply first demonstrate you
01:31 - how the things works okay
01:34 - so for this we will need to create one
01:37 - Loop
01:38 - so I'll be created for so here you I
01:41 - will do I equal to 0 I should be
01:45 - uh what you can say
01:47 - I should be less than equal to uh
01:51 - 10.
01:53 - I plus plus and I will simply right now
01:55 - I will just Echo the value of I
01:58 - equal I okay so now let me just add the
02:03 - certain permission for this
02:06 - and 15 okay dot slash 15 oh sorry
02:13 - yeah so one to ten the numbers are
02:15 - getting printed okay from 0 to 10 sorry
02:18 - so
02:19 - suppose in some condition you wanted
02:22 - like if uh if I is equal to uh 5 then
02:28 - after that your Loop should not execute
02:31 - okay so at this type of certain
02:33 - conditions uh you will execute from the
02:36 - loop okay so how you can do it you have
02:39 - to just provide the if condition
02:44 - uh like this if
02:47 - sorry
02:50 - if dollar I is equal to some number that
02:55 - is 5.
02:56 - so in this case what you have to do then
02:59 - you have to just break the loop
03:03 - and
03:05 - what you can do else
03:08 - you have to just Echo this value of
03:12 - I
03:14 - okay
03:16 - so you have to just save it okay and I
03:20 - will run the loop here again
03:23 - so uh uh I think I'm getting some kind
03:27 - of syntax error
03:29 - at line number
03:32 - 13.
03:34 - if then equal to 5 yeah we have not
03:37 - closed the if condition okay
03:43 - clear the screen again
03:47 - okay sorry in else condition we are not
03:50 - writing anything right now so
03:53 - now I will write f i here
03:56 - and now you will get to know about how
03:59 - the things are working so here you can
04:01 - see the loop is getting uh started from
04:03 - zero and it executing till 4 but when if
04:06 - your value of I is equal to 5 then in
04:09 - this case what is happening your Loop is
04:12 - not executing further okay so similarly
04:16 - uh in case of continue we will see and I
04:19 - hope you got it like how the break
04:21 - condition works okay suppose if you want
04:23 - to give some other number like if you
04:26 - want to give two okay so at at that time
04:29 - your Loop also will get uh
04:33 - break
04:34 - Okay so to save
04:38 - and I will just run the script again so
04:40 - here you can see 0 and 1 is only printed
04:43 - okay so now we will talk about the
04:46 - continue so I will just Sim simply copy
04:50 - this Loop and I will just here paste it
04:53 - and I'll write like this here
04:57 - comment out for you guys because you
04:59 - will need this code
05:01 - continue and here I will use only the
05:04 - continue
05:05 - okay so here what it will do it will
05:08 - skip that particular part okay if I run
05:10 - this loop again so here you can see it
05:12 - has escaped two
05:13 - okay let me first clear the screen so
05:15 - that uh and I will just comment of this
05:18 - part
05:19 - because you should not get confused okay
05:22 - so here you can see it has printed now
05:25 - you will see two is not getting printed
05:27 - okay why because it is execute continue
05:30 - statement basically skips that
05:32 - particular part okay
05:35 - so that's all about the break and
05:37 - continue uh if you want like more
05:39 - example uh let me just create uh like
05:42 - what we will do we will just take the
05:44 - input for the user from the user in the
05:46 - for Loop and based on the user input we
05:50 - will break the statement
05:52 - okay so I'll just comment of this all
05:54 - also
05:56 - and I will paste it here and here I what
05:59 - I will do I will do read
06:03 - U input okay and I will Echo here
06:10 - enter your age
06:13 - or here I can give the variable name is
06:15 - also it now okay
06:18 - so here I will do if age
06:22 - is equal to or less than we can say if
06:26 - is is less than 18
06:30 - so then what we have to do eco
06:36 - you are not allowed
06:40 - in party like this okay
06:43 - and else what we can do else eco
06:48 - you are allowed in party
06:52 - okay and here after printing this we can
06:56 - just come out of the loop and you can
06:59 - use a break statement okay
07:01 - so clear and again run the loop and here
07:05 - it is showing interior as my age is
07:07 - suppose 23 so you are allowed in party
07:10 - okay so again it is asking 34 okay so
07:14 - now if I'll enter 12 so here you can see
07:17 - you are not allowed in pattern and you
07:18 - came out of the loop so that is the use
07:20 - case of the break statement to come out
07:22 - of the execution
07:23 - okay
07:25 - so uh that's all for today's guys and I
07:27 - hope you liked it and if you have any
07:28 - queries you can ask us in the comment
07:30 - section and you will get the whole
07:31 - source code in our GitHub repository so
07:34 - that's all for today's and I will meet
07:35 - you in the next video thank you thank
07:37 - you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

now in this particular video I'll be talking about the break and continue okay so we will learn about these two keywords in our shell scripting so let me first create the file with their name like break and continue dot sh okay we are good to go let me add the c bank because without this we cannot run our script Okay so now let me just tell you the execution like what and what is this so let me first talk about the break okay so break is basically it breaks the sorry it oh what I'm doing here man it breaks it breaks the execution of a loop okay so basically it makes the execution of a loop and the continue is nothing but it skips the execution on some certain condition okay so we will do and do the Practical part of this so so break will basically it will break the execution and it will not to do the further operation but in continue it will execute but like it will skip that particular part okay so uh let me just start with the for Loop because we will be using the follow for the implementation break and continue and also you can use while loop also it's all upon you so I will simply first demonstrate you how the things works okay so for this we will need to create one Loop so I'll be created for so here you I will do I equal to 0 I should be uh what you can say I should be less than equal to uh 10. I plus plus and I will simply right now I will just Echo the value of I equal I okay so now let me just add the certain permission for this and 15 okay dot slash 15 oh sorry yeah so one to ten the numbers are getting printed okay from 0 to 10 sorry so suppose in some condition you wanted like if uh if I is equal to uh 5 then after that your Loop should not execute okay so at this type of certain conditions uh you will execute from the loop okay so how you can do it you have to just provide the if condition uh like this if sorry if dollar I is equal to some number that is 5. so in this case what you have to do then you have to just break the loop and what you can do else you have to just Echo this value of I okay so you have to just save it okay and I will run the loop here again so uh uh I think I'm getting some kind of syntax error at line number 13. if then equal to 5 yeah we have not closed the if condition okay clear the screen again okay sorry in else condition we are not writing anything right now so now I will write f i here and now you will get to know about how the things are working so here you can see the loop is getting uh started from zero and it executing till 4 but when if your value of I is equal to 5 then in this case what is happening your Loop is not executing further okay so similarly uh in case of continue we will see and I hope you got it like how the break condition works okay suppose if you want to give some other number like if you want to give two okay so at at that time your Loop also will get uh break Okay so to save and I will just run the script again so here you can see 0 and 1 is only printed okay so now we will talk about the continue so I will just Sim simply copy this Loop and I will just here paste it and I'll write like this here comment out for you guys because you will need this code continue and here I will use only the continue okay so here what it will do it will skip that particular part okay if I run this loop again so here you can see it has escaped two okay let me first clear the screen so that uh and I will just comment of this part because you should not get confused okay so here you can see it has printed now you will see two is not getting printed okay why because it is execute continue statement basically skips that particular part okay so that's all about the break and continue uh if you want like more example uh let me just create uh like what we will do we will just take the input for the user from the user in the for Loop and based on the user input we will break the statement okay so I'll just comment of this all also and I will paste it here and here I what I will do I will do read U input okay and I will Echo here enter your age or here I can give the variable name is also it now okay so here I will do if age is equal to or less than we can say if is is less than 18 so then what we have to do eco you are not allowed in party like this okay and else what we can do else eco you are allowed in party okay and here after printing this we can just come out of the loop and you can use a break statement okay so clear and again run the loop and here it is showing interior as my age is suppose 23 so you are allowed in party okay so again it is asking 34 okay so now if I'll enter 12 so here you can see you are not allowed in pattern and you came out of the loop so that is the use case of the break statement to come out of the execution okay so uh that's all for today's guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries you can ask us in the comment section and you will get the whole source code in our GitHub repository so that's all for today's and I will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching
