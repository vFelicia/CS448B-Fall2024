00:00 - particular video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the SSH command okay so basically
00:04 - this command we use to connect to the
00:06 - remote machines or if you are not aware
00:08 - of remote machine then let me tell you
00:10 - first what is the remote machine so
00:11 - basically this is the concept of cloud
00:13 - computing in which
00:15 - uh when you use a machine this is just
00:18 - like a similar machine but we access it
00:21 - remotely okay that will be the similar
00:23 - machine like your PC and the same
00:25 - operating system will be there okay and
00:28 - it will be Linux or it can be
00:31 - Windows OS okay so basically that
00:35 - particular instance or that particular
00:37 - machine is stored in the data center of
00:40 - different Cloud providers if you are
00:41 - using AWS then Amazon the Amazon Amazon
00:44 - data center will be there if you are
00:46 - using Azure then Microsoft cloud data
00:50 - center will be there and in case of
00:51 - Google then Google data center will be
00:54 - there okay so basically what we are
00:58 - going to perform in this particular
00:59 - video so first of all I will create a
01:02 - virtual machine in Azure you can also do
01:04 - it because it's a free and using sandbox
01:07 - so you can uh like
01:09 - you get one hour excess of the Azure
01:11 - portal so you can go on this particular
01:14 - link or you can just search for create a
01:16 - VM using Azure portal then you will get
01:18 - this link and you will just need to
01:20 - login using your Microsoft account
01:22 - so I'll just activate sandbox it will
01:25 - take some time just wait for it
01:28 - okay but uh let me tell you first like
01:31 - SSH command so what port it uses so
01:35 - basically SSS command uses port number
01:37 - 22 okay
01:40 - so now this processes uh going on and in
01:44 - this particular this article you can
01:46 - learn about how you can create a virtual
01:48 - machine also if you are interested okay
01:56 - so now 91 92
02:00 - yeah
02:01 - okay and you have to just to go there
02:04 - and click on this as your portal
02:10 - okay
02:14 - okay now here this here is the Azure
02:17 - portal you can easily uh create virtual
02:19 - machines in this just click on this
02:21 - virtual machine
02:23 - okay so I will just click on it
02:27 - and you have to just click on create
02:31 - as your virtual machine
02:36 - okay so here you can see the resource
02:39 - code you have to select just this learn
02:41 - and virtual machine name I will just use
02:44 - a Linux VM
02:45 - and this is the Ubuntu Server we are
02:48 - going to use in our case this is a image
02:51 - it means which operating system you are
02:52 - going to use so here you can say choose
02:54 - the base operating system or applicator
02:56 - applicable for the VM so we are all
02:59 - ready to selected there is Ubuntu server
03:01 - you can also select different OS like
03:03 - Windows and all for Windows we use RDP
03:06 - okay
03:07 - so now here you can see uh if you are
03:10 - going with this sh public key then it
03:12 - will create a DOT pem file but right now
03:14 - we are not going with it we are going uh
03:17 - it's a simple way that is a password so
03:19 - I will just provide a password that is
03:21 - ayush and I will provide a username
03:27 - okay
03:33 - okay matching now SSH Port is there you
03:37 - can enable HTTP also it so all your
03:40 - choice
03:41 - okay now next
03:44 - and here you don't have to do any kind
03:46 - of changes no changes you have to do
03:49 - okay
03:50 - so you can directly just click on review
03:53 - plus create okay
03:57 - so basically the main purpose of this
03:58 - video is to so just show you the working
04:00 - of SSH command okay
04:03 - so one uh this money scene is deployed
04:06 - then I can show you easily
04:10 - okay so here you can see validation pass
04:12 - it means you have done all the things
04:13 - correctly you have to just click on
04:15 - create here
04:26 - okay initializing deployment let's wait
04:30 - it will take approx so I think two to
04:32 - three minutes of time
04:34 - and missing this video will be the first
04:36 - part in our next part we will cover some
04:38 - different things in SSH
04:41 - like how we can share files and all
04:43 - those things
04:48 - okay deployment is in progress let's
04:51 - wait
05:00 - okay it's going on here you can see the
05:02 - all the steps uh whatever it is uh
05:05 - performing okay in like Linux IP VM NSG
05:13 - okay it will take approx 2 minute of
05:17 - time now yeah Linux VM is now it is
05:19 - getting created
05:24 - let's wait
05:34 - [Music]
05:40 - okay
05:43 - or you can skip this part in the video
05:46 - like you can fast forward
05:51 - now it's done just one confirmation
05:54 - should come yeah your deployment is
05:56 - complete you have to just click on this
05:58 - go to resource
06:01 - okay
06:05 - yeah
06:06 - uh
06:08 - uh let's wait as end is not ready why
06:13 - not ready troubleshoot the issue
06:17 - okay I'm not getting why it's not ready
06:22 - let me just click on this
06:28 - VM extension issues
06:36 - no issue found okay okay now if you
06:39 - found uh let me just
06:42 - uh
06:44 - yeah IP address is visible to me I hope
06:47 - now I can uh
06:50 - 2. so here you can see the IP address of
06:53 - this Linux VM machine and I know the my
06:55 - username and password
06:58 - so I will use this SSH command okay
07:06 - and SSH
07:09 - and the username is whatever I use at
07:13 - the rate and the IP which you have
07:15 - copied
07:16 - enter
07:19 - okay so here it is asking are you sure
07:21 - you want to continue yeah I'm absolutely
07:23 - damn sure
07:25 - click on yes
07:28 - okay so we have to just type the
07:31 - password
07:36 - I hope I have entered correct password
07:40 - okay done so here you can see I use
07:44 - Linux VM as the username and uh is the
07:47 - host name of that PC or Ubuntu machine
07:50 - and this is ayush okay so you can say
07:53 - this is not my Ubuntu machine okay you
07:57 - can clear the screen if I'll do LS so
07:59 - here it is nothing okay
08:01 - so if I will just create one file
08:06 - uh let me create a cat
08:11 - test Dot txt
08:13 - uh leave I will not create one file let
08:16 - me just install the one Apache server in
08:19 - the sudo apt uh get installed
08:24 - Apache 2. so it is basically a web
08:26 - server we use to host web applications
08:28 - so
08:30 - okay so just click hit enter
08:35 - okay oh it's not working
08:42 - I don't know why it's not working let's
08:44 - check
08:47 - I'll just close this terminal again I
08:49 - will connect uh I hope that connection
08:52 - has been lost
08:55 - okay SSH the username and the IP
09:00 - okay IPS not getting printed let me
09:03 - check what is the IP I have this one
09:06 - okay
09:10 - not I don't want HTTP something like
09:13 - that just remove all those things
09:16 - hit enter
09:20 - okay the password
09:26 - okay
09:29 - so now I am this machine I will just
09:31 - install
09:34 - Apache server Apache to hit enter yeah
09:38 - we want to continue yes
09:41 - click on yes
09:43 - now here you can see the Apache server
09:45 - is installing
09:48 - at this not my Linux machine like you
09:51 - will think like this is my Ubuntu
09:53 - machine okay
09:55 - so Apache 2 is getting okay okay
09:58 - uh after uh creating the server you will
10:01 - see the default page of Apache
10:06 - okay we are done and I will just reload
10:08 - okay so automatically here you can see
10:10 - the Apache server uh default page
10:14 - is displaying okay so uh let me change
10:18 - this uh like I will just change the
10:21 - permission of one folder that is
10:25 - 700 77 and the folder is www
10:32 - HTML basically this is the directory
10:35 - where your index.steon file is stored
10:38 - I'll do sudo now okay
10:41 - and now let's move back into those
10:44 - directories I will just use CD dot dot
10:48 - slash LS
10:51 - again CD dot dot slash LS I will move
10:56 - into the war
10:58 - www.html
11:03 - okay now we'll do LS here you will see
11:05 - there is nothing I will just create
11:10 - index.html and I will okay permission
11:13 - denied I will use sudo
11:17 - okay again it's permission is denied
11:20 - okay LS iPhone l
11:24 - CH mode seven seven
11:30 - operation not permitted let's use sudo
11:35 - okay now I can edit this index.html file
11:40 - okay I will use this body
11:43 - and the H1 tag I will use this is
11:50 - tutorial based on SSH by
12:00 - ayush
12:02 - okay and just close this body tag Ctrl D
12:08 - to save and just reload this page
12:13 - okay so you're done here you can see
12:16 - this is tutorial based on SSH by iOS so
12:19 - I hope you uh got to learn about
12:22 - different things in this particular like
12:24 - how you can create VMS in Azure Azure
12:28 - okay
12:29 - and also how you can
12:32 - install Apache server in your remote
12:35 - machine and the most important thing SSH
12:38 - command how you can connect
12:40 - so in our next video we will use
12:42 - different commands to we will see how we
12:44 - can upload files from our like this
12:47 - local machine to this machine but sorry
12:56 - but we will use uh like different server
13:00 - okay like tomorrow we will use ec2
13:04 - server of Amazon okay because uh this
13:08 - machine will get uh like out of network
13:11 - in one hour okay not in even one hour it
13:15 - will take
13:17 - approx 35 minutes will be remaining okay
13:20 - 42 minutes okay
13:22 - so thank you guys for watching this
13:24 - video and I hope you liked it and got to
13:26 - learn about new things so we will meet

found uh let me just uh yeah IP address is visible to me I hope now I can uh 2. so here you can see the IP address of this Linux VM machine and I know the my username and password so I will use this SSH command okay and SSH and the username is whatever I use at the rate and the IP which you have copied enter okay so here it is asking are you sure you want to continue yeah I'm absolutely damn sure click on yes okay so we have to just type the password I hope I have entered correct password okay done so here you can see I use Linux VM as the username and uh is the host name of that PC or Ubuntu
