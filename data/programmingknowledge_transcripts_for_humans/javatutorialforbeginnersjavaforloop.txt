00:00 - hello guys welcome back to the Java
00:01 - tutorial Series so today we are learning
00:03 - loops in Java so basically there are
00:06 - three types of Loops in Java one is for
00:08 - Loop while loop and do while loop so in
00:11 - this video we are particularly
00:12 - particularly focusing on the for Loop so
00:15 - what is for Loop the Java for Loop is
00:16 - used to iterate a part of the program
00:18 - several times if the number of the
00:21 - iteration is fixed it is recommended to
00:23 - use a for Loop so here is here you can
00:26 - see the pictorial format of the each
00:28 - Loops in Java so here here you can see
00:31 - let me just zoom it out okay
00:33 - the for Loop is the Java for Loop is
00:36 - used to iterate a part of the program
00:38 - several times okay so when we when we
00:40 - have to perform a several tasks that is
00:43 - the same task but at the number of
00:46 - iterations are there then we we can use
00:48 - the for Loop if the number of iteration
00:49 - is fixed then we can use for Loop okay
00:52 - so what is while loop the Java while
00:55 - loop is used to iterate a part of the
00:56 - program several times if the number of
00:58 - the iteration is not fixed so what is
01:00 - the main difference between the for Loop
01:01 - and while loop when we when you when we
01:03 - have to use it is the only difference
01:06 - between them is when the number of
01:08 - iterations are fixed we can use for Loop
01:10 - or when the number of iteration is not
01:12 - fixed we can use while loop okay so what
01:14 - is do while loop the Java do while loop
01:17 - is used to iterate a part of the program
01:18 - several times use it it use if the
01:21 - number of the iteration is not fixed and
01:24 - you must have to execute the for loop at
01:26 - least once so it just uh means you can
01:30 - say that say it as a incremental part of
01:32 - the while loop where you where
01:34 - you have to perform that increment
01:36 - incrementing task at least once okay and
01:40 - then uh when the loop it reads next time
01:42 - the while condition is checked okay so
01:45 - we'll be discussing about it in the
01:46 - particular upcoming videos so for this
01:48 - video I will be discussing about the for
01:50 - Loop only
01:52 - okay so let's just get started uh so
01:55 - here you can see the Syntax for the for
01:56 - Loop for is for is the keyword for
01:58 - declaration for Loop and three
02:00 - parameters are there initialization is
02:02 - there condition is there and increment
02:05 - decrement is there okay so we'll be
02:08 - seeing uh in detail when we are
02:10 - code this for Loop okay so next comes
02:15 - the
02:16 - how the flow of the for Loop is
02:18 - maintained inside a code okay so first
02:21 - of all initialization is done then the
02:23 - condition is checked if that condition
02:25 - becomes false the loop is terminated and
02:29 - exam control flow of the code is resume
02:33 - to the end of the for Loop okay and if
02:36 - the condition match then the statement
02:38 - inside that for Loop gets executed and
02:40 - increment decrement is there according
02:43 - to that it increments or decrements the
02:46 - variable counter variable and it again
02:48 - go for the checking the condition okay
02:51 - so enough talking about the for Loop
02:54 - let's jump into your IDE and call it out
02:57 - okay so I'm in my IDE just let me create
03:03 - one class name for Loop
03:07 - okay the class name should be start with
03:10 - capital
03:11 - one for Loop okay let me just increase
03:13 - the font size so that you guys can see
03:18 - main method should be there okay so
03:22 - first of all I will take only just
03:23 - simple program then we will do one more
03:25 - program
03:26 - okay so at first let me just declare one
03:31 - for okay so I will declare it for
03:35 - int
03:36 - I is equals to 1 I is less than equals
03:41 - to 10 and each time we are doing I plus
03:45 - plus okay
03:47 - don't worry I will I will be explaining
03:49 - you these things what you have written
03:52 - here
03:53 - okay and I'll be painting I okay
03:56 - so here at line number three you you can
04:00 - see I have told you that there are three
04:02 - parameters are there inside of for Loop
04:04 - so first parameter integer I is equals
04:07 - to 1 is the initialization oh so what do
04:09 - you mean by initialization it is the
04:11 - initial condition which is executed when
04:14 - this Loop starts here we can initialize
04:16 - the variable or we can use the an
04:18 - already initialized variable okay it's
04:21 - up to you okay and then comes this part
04:24 - which is condition okay the second
04:27 - condition is second is it Con condition
04:30 - which is executed each time to test the
04:32 - condition of the loop it continues
04:34 - execution until the condition is false
04:37 - it must return the Boolean value either
04:39 - true or false it is option optional
04:42 - condition okay and this is the part
04:44 - third part that is increment or
04:46 - decrement increment means plus plus
04:48 - decrement means minus minus okay it
04:50 - increments or decrements the variable
04:52 - value and it it is an optional condition
04:54 - okay and the statement means this part
04:56 - inside title for Loop that that code of
04:59 - the part that we have to execute okay so
05:02 - that is pretty much about the for Loop
05:05 - let me just run this
05:09 - uh so yes here you can see
05:12 - let me just increase the ha
05:14 - so where our conditions start from I is
05:17 - equals to 1 and until I is less than
05:21 - equals to 10 we are moving our iterating
05:25 - our for Loop okay so at first
05:28 - system.out.print value of I should be
05:31 - printed okay so when we are coming for
05:33 - the first time the value of I is 1 so
05:35 - that is going to print it on the screen
05:37 - and due to this print Ln new line the
05:40 - execution goes to new line and after
05:42 - that I plus plus is there so we will
05:44 - when the for Loops goes again for
05:47 - checking then then that that time is
05:50 - value is 2 okay so I is so now is value
05:54 - is 2 so 2 is less than equals to 10 is
05:57 - it right then we again come inside the
05:59 - for Loop 2 is going to print it this in
06:01 - this way again again and again the for
06:04 - Loop runs and at last when the value is
06:07 - 10 less than 10 yes when we print 10 and
06:10 - when we do I plus plus the ISO value
06:14 - become 11 and when we check I 11 is less
06:17 - than equals to 10 so 11 is not less than
06:19 - equals to 10 so Loop terminates and we
06:22 - exit out of the loop and program is
06:25 - ended okay so that's how 1 to 10 is
06:27 - going to print it on the console okay so
06:30 - let me just take another example that is
06:34 - very often used example so let me just
06:38 - comment it out
06:40 - so what we have expected to print on the
06:43 - console is this okay we have to print
06:47 - the this let me just create it first for
06:52 - you
06:53 - guys
06:55 - okay airport three four five okay one
07:00 - space should be there after each
07:03 - star
07:06 - okay
07:09 - yes
07:12 - so
07:14 - okay so this is the expected output on
07:16 - the console this is this series of the
07:19 - Stars should be printed okay using the
07:22 - for Loop okay so let's just get started
07:25 - I will declare one for Loop which will
07:28 - go from
07:30 - one
07:33 - two
07:35 - five
07:37 - and each time I will be doing I plus
07:39 - plus that is I will be incrementing the
07:41 - value of I and I need again one more
07:45 - for Loop
07:47 - so here I I am declaring for Loop inside
07:51 - of for Loop that is the nested for Loop
07:53 - okay
07:54 - so I'll be declaring new variable
07:57 - integer J which is equals to 1 and I'll
08:01 - be checking that whether my J is less
08:04 - than equals to I and I'll be doing each
08:06 - time J plus plus
08:08 - okay
08:09 - and inside this
08:12 - I will be printing my star okay
08:20 - here okay now star is going to get
08:22 - printed on the console so this since
08:24 - this is the string I have to
08:27 - put it inside the curly braces and if
08:30 - after the for Loop execution
08:34 - an outer for loop I will just
08:38 - print a new line okay so now if I
08:42 - execute this code
08:44 - I hope this will work yeah this is
08:46 - working
08:47 - fine
08:49 - so only one thing is there we are not
08:51 - getting that space in between each star
08:54 - okay so that that is because of this I
08:56 - am not given the space here so that
08:59 - should be rectified here
09:00 - yeah so here we are getting that pattern
09:03 - one star then two stars and three star
09:05 - four star like that you can print how
09:07 - many
09:08 - as many Star you want just to just you
09:12 - have to increase this value of the five
09:13 - then it will get work okay
09:16 - so I hope you guys have learned about
09:18 - the for Loop you guys have got some idea
09:21 - about the for Loop so in upcoming videos
09:23 - we'll be learning about while loop and
09:25 - do while loop and after that I'll be
09:27 - giving one exercise based on the loops
09:29 - and whatever I talk to you till now okay
09:32 - so thank you guys for watching this
09:34 - video bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to the Java tutorial Series so today we are learning loops in Java so basically there are three types of Loops in Java one is for Loop while loop and do while loop so in this video we are particularly particularly focusing on the for Loop so what is for Loop the Java for Loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times if the number of the iteration is fixed it is recommended to use a for Loop so here is here you can see the pictorial format of the each Loops in Java so here here you can see let me just zoom it out okay the for Loop is the Java for Loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times okay so when we when we have to perform a several tasks that is the same task but at the number of iterations are there then we we can use the for Loop if the number of iteration is fixed then we can use for Loop okay so what is while loop the Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times if the number of the iteration is not fixed so what is the main difference between the for Loop and while loop when we when you when we have to use it is the only difference between them is when the number of iterations are fixed we can use for Loop or when the number of iteration is not fixed we can use while loop okay so what is do while loop the Java do while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times use it it use if the number of the iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the for loop at least once so it just uh means you can say that say it as a incremental part of the while loop where you where you have to perform that increment incrementing task at least once okay and then uh when the loop it reads next time the while condition is checked okay so we'll be discussing about it in the particular upcoming videos so for this video I will be discussing about the for Loop only okay so let's just get started uh so here you can see the Syntax for the for Loop for is for is the keyword for declaration for Loop and three parameters are there initialization is there condition is there and increment decrement is there okay so we'll be seeing uh in detail when we are code this for Loop okay so next comes the how the flow of the for Loop is maintained inside a code okay so first of all initialization is done then the condition is checked if that condition becomes false the loop is terminated and exam control flow of the code is resume to the end of the for Loop okay and if the condition match then the statement inside that for Loop gets executed and increment decrement is there according to that it increments or decrements the variable counter variable and it again go for the checking the condition okay so enough talking about the for Loop let's jump into your IDE and call it out okay so I'm in my IDE just let me create one class name for Loop okay the class name should be start with capital one for Loop okay let me just increase the font size so that you guys can see main method should be there okay so first of all I will take only just simple program then we will do one more program okay so at first let me just declare one for okay so I will declare it for int I is equals to 1 I is less than equals to 10 and each time we are doing I plus plus okay don't worry I will I will be explaining you these things what you have written here okay and I'll be painting I okay so here at line number three you you can see I have told you that there are three parameters are there inside of for Loop so first parameter integer I is equals to 1 is the initialization oh so what do you mean by initialization it is the initial condition which is executed when this Loop starts here we can initialize the variable or we can use the an already initialized variable okay it's up to you okay and then comes this part which is condition okay the second condition is second is it Con condition which is executed each time to test the condition of the loop it continues execution until the condition is false it must return the Boolean value either true or false it is option optional condition okay and this is the part third part that is increment or decrement increment means plus plus decrement means minus minus okay it increments or decrements the variable value and it it is an optional condition okay and the statement means this part inside title for Loop that that code of the part that we have to execute okay so that is pretty much about the for Loop let me just run this uh so yes here you can see let me just increase the ha so where our conditions start from I is equals to 1 and until I is less than equals to 10 we are moving our iterating our for Loop okay so at first system.out.print value of I should be printed okay so when we are coming for the first time the value of I is 1 so that is going to print it on the screen and due to this print Ln new line the execution goes to new line and after that I plus plus is there so we will when the for Loops goes again for checking then then that that time is value is 2 okay so I is so now is value is 2 so 2 is less than equals to 10 is it right then we again come inside the for Loop 2 is going to print it this in this way again again and again the for Loop runs and at last when the value is 10 less than 10 yes when we print 10 and when we do I plus plus the ISO value become 11 and when we check I 11 is less than equals to 10 so 11 is not less than equals to 10 so Loop terminates and we exit out of the loop and program is ended okay so that's how 1 to 10 is going to print it on the console okay so let me just take another example that is very often used example so let me just comment it out so what we have expected to print on the console is this okay we have to print the this let me just create it first for you guys okay airport three four five okay one space should be there after each star okay yes so okay so this is the expected output on the console this is this series of the Stars should be printed okay using the for Loop okay so let's just get started I will declare one for Loop which will go from one two five and each time I will be doing I plus plus that is I will be incrementing the value of I and I need again one more for Loop so here I I am declaring for Loop inside of for Loop that is the nested for Loop okay so I'll be declaring new variable integer J which is equals to 1 and I'll be checking that whether my J is less than equals to I and I'll be doing each time J plus plus okay and inside this I will be printing my star okay here okay now star is going to get printed on the console so this since this is the string I have to put it inside the curly braces and if after the for Loop execution an outer for loop I will just print a new line okay so now if I execute this code I hope this will work yeah this is working fine so only one thing is there we are not getting that space in between each star okay so that that is because of this I am not given the space here so that should be rectified here yeah so here we are getting that pattern one star then two stars and three star four star like that you can print how many as many Star you want just to just you have to increase this value of the five then it will get work okay so I hope you guys have learned about the for Loop you guys have got some idea about the for Loop so in upcoming videos we'll be learning about while loop and do while loop and after that I'll be giving one exercise based on the loops and whatever I talk to you till now okay so thank you guys for watching this video bye bye
