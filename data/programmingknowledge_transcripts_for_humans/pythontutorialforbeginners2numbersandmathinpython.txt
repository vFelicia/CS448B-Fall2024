00:00 - hello guys welcome to the second video
00:02 - tutorial on Python programming for
00:04 - beginners in the last video I have given
00:07 - you introduction to Python and I have
00:10 - shown you how you can install python on
00:12 - your Windows operating system and uh I
00:15 - have given you a little example how you
00:17 - can use this python IDE called idle for
00:22 - the first time okay so in this video I'm
00:26 - going to continue and I'm going to show
00:28 - you how you can use numbers and uh a
00:32 - math in Python so if you
00:37 - are familiar with this last time I have
00:40 - shown you how to open this python shell
00:43 - right if you don't know uh how to open
00:47 - this shell once again I'm going to tell
00:49 - you you just need to go to your start
00:51 - menu and just go to python folder and
00:54 - just start this idle python guy from
00:58 - here and it will open uh this kind of
01:01 -  shell or python shell here now let's
01:04 - get started and let's see how we can do
01:07 - uh math in
01:10 - Python so uh like simple mathematics
01:14 - python can also do the maths uh for you
01:18 - so for example you want to add 5 plus 98
01:23 - it will give you the answer one3 you
01:26 - want you can even
01:28 - add minus values so minus 4
01:34 - 34
01:36 - plus 4 for example and will give you the
01:40 - answer 13 okay in the same way you can
01:43 - do the subtraction 5
01:47 - 56
01:48 - minus 34 it will give you the answer and
01:52 - it will also uh give you the negative
01:55 - value if you provide the value such as
01:59 - for example example 34 minus 56 will
02:03 - give you the negative value okay now for
02:07 - division uh what you can do uh you can
02:11 - just write uh for example 21 divided by
02:16 - so this is the symbol we use for
02:19 - divisions which is slash for example 27
02:22 - uh 21 divid by 7 is three which gives
02:26 - you the answer and if you want to
02:30 - divide the number and get some decimal
02:33 - values for example 23 divided by 7 will
02:37 - give you 3.28 something right so this
02:41 - will also give you decimal values now
02:44 - for example you don't want uh this these
02:49 - decimal values after the division you
02:52 - just want to uh see the whole value or
02:56 - the integer what you can do you can just
02:59 - write 23 three double slash 7 and this
03:03 - will give you the whole number which is
03:05 - three okay you can even so this this
03:10 - number is a integer and what is an
03:13 - integer integer is the whole number
03:15 - right you can even use decimal values
03:18 - which are called float in programming
03:21 - float values are values which have some
03:24 - decimal points for example
03:26 - 57.
03:28 - 2345 or whatever divide
03:32 - by 3.
03:35 - 22222 okay and press enter and it will
03:38 - give you an answer so you can even
03:40 - divide decimal values like this okay and
03:45 - remember this whenever you want to get
03:47 - the whole number just use double
03:50 - slashes now for
03:53 - multiplication multiplication is also
03:56 - simple for example you want to multiply
03:58 - two number 56 multiply so for
04:01 - multiplication you use this ASX symbol
04:04 - or star symbol simply so this star
04:07 - symbol or stic symbol will be used as a
04:10 - multiplication symbol okay so 56
04:14 - multiplied by 4 is 224 so you can use
04:19 - multiplication like
04:20 - this okay now for example you want to
04:24 - get the exponent of some number what an
04:28 - what is an exponent exponent is
04:30 - something like for example 2 exponent 3
04:35 - is 2 * by 2 * by 2 okay so 2 into 2 into
04:41 - 2 this is the exponent so you can do it
04:45 - like this and it will give you the
04:47 - answer but if you want the exponent for
04:51 - for example 2 to the power 15 how you
04:54 - can do you can do something like this
04:57 - two
04:58 - multiplied by two multi not like this
05:01 - but two multiped by two multiplied by
05:03 - two 15 times and this will be lengthy
05:06 - right so the simple way to find the
05:09 - exponent is use double Asis or double
05:13 - stars and then the power so 2 to the^ 15
05:18 - is 3 2 7
05:21 - 68 okay or 2 to the power 5 is 32 so
05:28 - this double star or double as you can
05:31 - use to get the power or exponent of your
05:36 - numbers
05:38 - okay now you may be wondering what may
05:41 - be the order of uh your operations which
05:45 - operation will take place when you have
05:49 - multiple multiple operation at the same
05:51 - time for example I want to
05:55 - do three multiply it by four
06:01 - +
06:03 - 5
06:05 - minus
06:07 - uh
06:08 - six and then divided
06:11 - by one or not one but two for example so
06:16 - what will be the order will three into
06:20 - four will happen first or four + 5 will
06:25 - happen 4 + 5 will happen first or 5 - 6
06:29 - will happen first or what is what will
06:31 - be the priority okay or what will be the
06:34 - order of this
06:36 - operation so uh like simple mathematics
06:41 - uh if you remember when you are were in
06:45 - school and or if you are in school still
06:48 - you know this uh basic formula called
06:52 - p m b a s okay so this is the order
06:59 - in which your operations will take place
07:03 - and this p stand for parenthesis e
07:06 - stands for exponents m stands for
07:10 - multiplication d stands for division a
07:13 - stands for addition and S stands for
07:16 - subtraction okay and the way you
07:19 - remember this is you can just uh
07:22 - abbreviate it as please excuse my dear
07:26 - Aunt s if you if you want to remember
07:29 - this order okay and so this will be the
07:33 - uh priority or this will be the order of
07:37 - your operation so if you want to
07:39 - prioritize something enclose that those
07:44 - operation in the parenthesis so if you
07:46 - want to do three plus u 4 and then
07:52 - multiplication or you want to multiply
07:55 - by uh five then the priority of this
07:59 - this addition is uh the most important
08:03 - or or this will happen first because
08:05 - this operation is enclosed in
08:07 - parenthesis and then this will happen
08:12 - Okay and then the uh the uh order will
08:17 - be like p m d a s if you can remember so
08:23 - for example I want to do something like
08:26 - this divide by uh um 6 minus
08:32 - 2 then the parenthesis priority will be
08:36 - the first and then the multiplication
08:40 - and then the division and if you have
08:43 - some subtraction then this will happen
08:46 - at the last
08:47 - okay so in this way you can use numbers
08:52 - and math in your
08:55 - python programs I hope you have enjoyed
08:58 - this video please wait comment and
08:59 - subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the second video tutorial on Python programming for beginners in the last video I have given you introduction to Python and I have shown you how you can install python on your Windows operating system and uh I have given you a little example how you can use this python IDE called idle for the first time okay so in this video I'm going to continue and I'm going to show you how you can use numbers and uh a math in Python so if you are familiar with this last time I have shown you how to open this python shell right if you don't know uh how to open this shell once again I'm going to tell you you just need to go to your start menu and just go to python folder and just start this idle python guy from here and it will open uh this kind of shell or python shell here now let's get started and let's see how we can do uh math in Python so uh like simple mathematics python can also do the maths uh for you so for example you want to add 5 plus 98 it will give you the answer one3 you want you can even add minus values so minus 4 34 plus 4 for example and will give you the answer 13 okay in the same way you can do the subtraction 5 56 minus 34 it will give you the answer and it will also uh give you the negative value if you provide the value such as for example example 34 minus 56 will give you the negative value okay now for division uh what you can do uh you can just write uh for example 21 divided by so this is the symbol we use for divisions which is slash for example 27 uh 21 divid by 7 is three which gives you the answer and if you want to divide the number and get some decimal values for example 23 divided by 7 will give you 3.28 something right so this will also give you decimal values now for example you don't want uh this these decimal values after the division you just want to uh see the whole value or the integer what you can do you can just write 23 three double slash 7 and this will give you the whole number which is three okay you can even so this this number is a integer and what is an integer integer is the whole number right you can even use decimal values which are called float in programming float values are values which have some decimal points for example 57. 2345 or whatever divide by 3. 22222 okay and press enter and it will give you an answer so you can even divide decimal values like this okay and remember this whenever you want to get the whole number just use double slashes now for multiplication multiplication is also simple for example you want to multiply two number 56 multiply so for multiplication you use this ASX symbol or star symbol simply so this star symbol or stic symbol will be used as a multiplication symbol okay so 56 multiplied by 4 is 224 so you can use multiplication like this okay now for example you want to get the exponent of some number what an what is an exponent exponent is something like for example 2 exponent 3 is 2 * by 2 * by 2 okay so 2 into 2 into 2 this is the exponent so you can do it like this and it will give you the answer but if you want the exponent for for example 2 to the power 15 how you can do you can do something like this two multiplied by two multi not like this but two multiped by two multiplied by two 15 times and this will be lengthy right so the simple way to find the exponent is use double Asis or double stars and then the power so 2 to the^ 15 is 3 2 7 68 okay or 2 to the power 5 is 32 so this double star or double as you can use to get the power or exponent of your numbers okay now you may be wondering what may be the order of uh your operations which operation will take place when you have multiple multiple operation at the same time for example I want to do three multiply it by four + 5 minus uh six and then divided by one or not one but two for example so what will be the order will three into four will happen first or four + 5 will happen 4 + 5 will happen first or 5 6 will happen first or what is what will be the priority okay or what will be the order of this operation so uh like simple mathematics uh if you remember when you are were in school and or if you are in school still you know this uh basic formula called p m b a s okay so this is the order in which your operations will take place and this p stand for parenthesis e stands for exponents m stands for multiplication d stands for division a stands for addition and S stands for subtraction okay and the way you remember this is you can just uh abbreviate it as please excuse my dear Aunt s if you if you want to remember this order okay and so this will be the uh priority or this will be the order of your operation so if you want to prioritize something enclose that those operation in the parenthesis so if you want to do three plus u 4 and then multiplication or you want to multiply by uh five then the priority of this this addition is uh the most important or or this will happen first because this operation is enclosed in parenthesis and then this will happen Okay and then the uh the uh order will be like p m d a s if you can remember so for example I want to do something like this divide by uh um 6 minus 2 then the parenthesis priority will be the first and then the multiplication and then the division and if you have some subtraction then this will happen at the last okay so in this way you can use numbers and math in your python programs I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
