00:00 - hello and welcome back guys to the
00:02 - another video of the Java tutorial
00:03 - Series so today onwards we are covering
00:06 - oops
00:08 - in Java okay so what is oops oops
00:12 - there's nothing but the object oriented
00:13 - programming language and simula is
00:16 - considered to be the first
00:18 - object-oriented programming language and
00:21 - someone says small talk is considered
00:24 - fully first fully truly object-oriented
00:27 - programming language okay so uh in
00:31 - today's world you can see uh C plus plus
00:34 - PHP Python and C sharp Java are the
00:38 - popular object oriented programming
00:40 - languages over there
00:41 - and so yes so first of all object means
00:46 - the real well entity such as pen chair
00:48 - table computer watch anything you see uh
00:52 - like Windows bed other object object
00:55 - oriented programming is a methodology of
00:57 - the Paradigm to design a program using
01:00 - classes and object what is classes and
01:02 - object we will cover in the our upcoming
01:04 - videos we will go in step by steps okay
01:06 - and it simplifies the software
01:08 - development and maintenance by providing
01:10 - some Concepts such as object classes
01:13 - inheritance polymorphism abstraction
01:15 - encapsulations so these are some
01:17 - features of the object oriented
01:19 - programming languages and here you can
01:21 - see one nice diagram is there and we
01:23 - will go in such a way in this way also
01:25 - okay we will cover first object then
01:28 - class then in returns polymorphism then
01:30 - abstraction and an encapsulation okay
01:31 - we'll cover in depth each of each one of
01:34 - these okay so before going into the oops
01:37 - Concepts there are some naming
01:39 - convention that you should follow
01:41 - so that your code looks nice and clean
01:44 - okay so the Java naming convention is a
01:47 - rule to follow as you decide what to
01:50 - name your identifiers such as class
01:52 - package variable constant method uh till
01:56 - now you can you have seen we are giving
01:58 - some names to the variables some name to
02:01 - the classes so there are some naming
02:03 - conventions are declared by the Sun
02:06 - microsystem or the net Netscape
02:08 - which we should follow so that our code
02:12 - should be maintainable and readable to
02:17 - the other users also okay
02:19 - CNC here you can see the second point
02:22 - but it is not forced to follow okay you
02:24 - are not forced to follow it but it so it
02:27 - is known as convention not rules okay
02:29 - this these convention are suggested by
02:31 - the several Java communities such as
02:33 - Java Sun Microsystems and Netscape as
02:35 - I've said you all classes interfaces and
02:38 - packages methods and Fields of the Java
02:40 - programming language are given according
02:42 - to the Java naming conventions okay if
02:45 - you fail to follow this convention it
02:47 - may generate confusions as I said it may
02:49 - generate confusion to the person who is
02:51 - reading your code and it may be uh get
02:54 - some error not errors
02:56 - ambiguity yes
02:59 - so let's talk about some advantages that
03:04 - you get in
03:06 - using the object oriented programming
03:09 - languages so first of all oops makes the
03:12 - development and maintenance easier
03:13 - whereas in procedure oriented
03:15 - programming language it is not easy to
03:17 - manage if the code grows as project size
03:19 - increases okay so what is procedure
03:21 - oriented programming language is the
03:22 - language such as C are the procedure
03:25 - oriented programming languages and
03:27 - languages like Java although object
03:29 - Oriental programming language we will
03:30 - cover in depth in our upcoming videos
03:32 - okay oops provides the data hiding
03:34 - whereas in procedure oriented
03:36 - programming language global data can be
03:38 - accessed from anywhere for the data
03:40 - hiding we can use
03:42 - abstractions abstraction is a feature of
03:45 - the object-oriented programming
03:46 - languages which allows us to hide the
03:49 - complexity
03:50 - okay and third one is oops provides the
03:54 - ability to simulate the layer real world
03:56 - events more effectively okay one second
04:00 - guys
04:02 - okay so where we are so these are some
04:05 - naming convention that you should follow
04:07 - while writing your code and I have
04:10 - talked about the advantages also and in
04:13 - our next upcoming videos we will be
04:15 - starting for the covering the object in
04:17 - class 10 inheritance as follows okay so
04:20 - thank you guys for watching this video

hello and welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today onwards we are covering oops in Java okay so what is oops oops there's nothing but the object oriented programming language and simula is considered to be the first objectoriented programming language and someone says small talk is considered fully first fully truly objectoriented programming language okay so uh in today's world you can see uh C plus plus PHP Python and C sharp Java are the popular object oriented programming languages over there and so yes so first of all object means the real well entity such as pen chair table computer watch anything you see uh like Windows bed other object object oriented programming is a methodology of the Paradigm to design a program using classes and object what is classes and object we will cover in the our upcoming videos we will go in step by steps okay and it simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some Concepts such as object classes inheritance polymorphism abstraction encapsulations so these are some features of the object oriented programming languages and here you can see one nice diagram is there and we will go in such a way in this way also okay we will cover first object then class then in returns polymorphism then abstraction and an encapsulation okay we'll cover in depth each of each one of these okay so before going into the oops Concepts there are some naming convention that you should follow so that your code looks nice and clean okay so the Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class package variable constant method uh till now you can you have seen we are giving some names to the variables some name to the classes so there are some naming conventions are declared by the Sun microsystem or the net Netscape which we should follow so that our code should be maintainable and readable to the other users also okay CNC here you can see the second point but it is not forced to follow okay you are not forced to follow it but it so it is known as convention not rules okay this these convention are suggested by the several Java communities such as Java Sun Microsystems and Netscape as I've said you all classes interfaces and packages methods and Fields of the Java programming language are given according to the Java naming conventions okay if you fail to follow this convention it may generate confusions as I said it may generate confusion to the person who is reading your code and it may be uh get some error not errors ambiguity yes so let's talk about some advantages that you get in using the object oriented programming languages so first of all oops makes the development and maintenance easier whereas in procedure oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if the code grows as project size increases okay so what is procedure oriented programming language is the language such as C are the procedure oriented programming languages and languages like Java although object Oriental programming language we will cover in depth in our upcoming videos okay oops provides the data hiding whereas in procedure oriented programming language global data can be accessed from anywhere for the data hiding we can use abstractions abstraction is a feature of the objectoriented programming languages which allows us to hide the complexity okay and third one is oops provides the ability to simulate the layer real world events more effectively okay one second guys okay so where we are so these are some naming convention that you should follow while writing your code and I have talked about the advantages also and in our next upcoming videos we will be starting for the covering the object in class 10 inheritance as follows okay so thank you guys for watching this video
