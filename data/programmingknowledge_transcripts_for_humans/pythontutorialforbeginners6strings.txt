00:00 - hello guys welcome to the sixth video
00:02 - tutorial on Python programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:07 - show you how you can use string in your
00:10 - Python program efficiently so I think I
00:13 - have shown you uh in the earlier videos
00:16 - how to use strings uh very briefly but
00:19 - in this video I'm going to uh take this
00:22 - string in
00:24 - detail so I have this uh python file uh
00:29 - I have shown you uh in the last videos
00:31 - that how you can make python files and
00:34 - run them uh using this run Command right
00:39 - so I have this python file and I have
00:41 - this python shell open so I'm going to
00:43 - write my code here and uh I will see the
00:46 - result in this shell okay so how to use
00:51 - strings in Python so there are three
00:55 - method or three ways you can use strings
00:59 - and and I'm going to show you all three
01:02 - ways so consider this
01:05 - example we have three variables a b and
01:09 - c and all three of them I have assigned
01:12 - a string one
01:15 - string which is assigned to variable a
01:19 - uh is enclosed in single codes right the
01:24 - second string is enclosed in double
01:27 - codes right and the the third string
01:31 - which is assigned to C is enclosed in
01:34 - three or triple codes and I'm going
01:38 - trying to print all three of them one by
01:41 - one so I want to print a print B and
01:44 - print C and let's see what happens so
01:47 - first of all I'm going to save my
01:49 - program and then I will just run this
01:53 - module or press F5 to run
01:55 - it and when I press uh this run I will
02:00 - see the result here and the result will
02:04 - be the same so you can print the same
02:09 - string in three ways either you can use
02:13 - single quote or you can do or you can
02:16 - use uh double quotes or you can use
02:19 - triple quotes to print the string and
02:22 - the result will always be same in
02:26 - Python now suppose you want to uh
02:32 - use for example this is a string
02:35 - enclosed in single code and you want to
02:37 - use some single code here so for example
02:41 - I want to uh say uh I'm a single qued
02:47 - string
02:50 - and for example I want to use a word
02:53 - called um don't uh which also take a
02:58 - single quote here this kind of single
03:01 - code and when I use the single
03:04 - code which uh with the string which is
03:07 - inclosed already in single code then
03:11 - what you'll your Python program will
03:14 - interpret is your string starts from
03:17 - here and your string ends here and this
03:21 - will be uh some alien to your python you
03:25 - know Python program
03:28 - because uh it will think that this
03:31 - single quotes uh is start from here and
03:34 - ends here so this is a string and what
03:37 - is this it's not recognized by the
03:40 - python so whenever you want to use
03:43 - single code in the string which is
03:46 - already there inside the single code you
03:51 - can use a Escape character and what is
03:54 - the escape character in uh python Escape
03:58 - character in Python is
04:00 - backs slash so just use this backslash
04:03 - and now you can
04:05 - see that uh your back backslash
04:10 - is hiding or it's saying python that we
04:15 - want to use single code inside the
04:19 - string okay and this is called Escape
04:22 - character so in the same way when you
04:25 - want to use double code in the string
04:28 - which is already there in the double
04:30 - quotes for example here I want to use
04:33 - double quote the same problem will come
04:35 - here your Python program will see that
04:38 - your string starts here and ends here
04:41 - and this will be not this will not be
04:44 - recognized by your Python program so
04:47 - here also you can use back slash to hide
04:51 - or to uh you know say python that we are
04:55 - using double quotes but it's the part of
04:57 - the string and it's not starting or
05:00 - ending of the string
05:02 - okay in a same manner you can uh you
05:06 - know use single code
05:09 - here and you can use this back slash to
05:14 - uh show this backs slash or double codes
05:18 - here now I will save my program I will
05:21 - just click control s and run it once
05:25 - again F5 and you can see the answer
05:30 - is like this so I'm a single coded
05:33 - string and this single code is visible
05:35 - now here and uh just remember that this
05:40 - is just a Escape character so this will
05:43 - not be printed this will help your
05:46 - single code to print but this will not
05:48 - be printed in the same way you can see
05:51 - it's printing this uh double code here
05:55 - because we are using Escape character
05:57 - and in the same way it will work work uh
06:00 - in the third string like this now
06:04 - suppose you want to print this uh this
06:10 - Escape character so you have some string
06:13 - which uses this and you want to print
06:16 - here this backs slash how you can do
06:21 - it you just need to use where wherever
06:25 - you need to you know print this back
06:27 - slash so for example I will use back
06:30 - slash here and let's see first of all
06:34 - what will be the result for example I
06:36 - want to print back slash here here and
06:39 - here and I will save my program and run
06:43 - it by pressing F or this run python
06:49 - module it will show me this backslash
06:53 - here right but better way is to just use
07:00 - double slash let's see what happens when
07:03 - we use double slash I will save it and
07:05 - run the
07:08 - program and now it shows back slash like
07:12 - this so it's always better to use double
07:16 - slash whenever you want to print this
07:19 - single back slash here okay
07:24 - now suppose you want to print the length
07:28 - or you want to find find out the length
07:30 - of your string what you can do you can
07:33 - use a built-in function called
07:35 - Len and I think I have already uh you
07:38 - know shown this function to you but once
07:42 - again I'm going to show you so I want to
07:44 - find the length of uh the string a I can
07:48 - just use Len and I will pass
07:51 - my variable a as an argument and I can
07:55 - save it and I I can run
07:57 - it I will run it here here once
08:00 - again and now it says 34 so the length
08:06 - of my string a is 34 okay so in the same
08:10 - way you can find the length of uh B and
08:13 - C also
08:16 - right
08:19 - now suppose I have string a for example
08:24 - I have string a like
08:28 - this
08:29 - hello and space and string B is like
08:35 - that hello world okay and how can I join
08:41 - these strings I can join these strings
08:45 - just like you just need to use a and
08:49 - plus and B so plus is called a
08:54 - concatenation operator here and what
08:57 - this plus does it just add adds or
08:59 - concatenate these two string A and B I
09:03 - will save the program and run it once
09:05 - again and it gives me the answer hello
09:08 - worlds right so this plus concatenates
09:13 - your string you can see here now for
09:18 - example I have this um I have this I
09:22 - will just delete this and I have this
09:25 - variable
09:26 - a and I want to print it 10 times and I
09:31 - don't want to use you know a and then
09:37 - plus a once again a I want to print it
09:42 - 10 times or suppose I want to print it
09:44 - 100 times there is a short way to print
09:48 - uh this uh a 100 times or whatever
09:50 - number of times what you need to do is
09:53 - you just need to use your variable which
09:57 - contains your string and
10:00 - then give a estri symbol here so give
10:05 - this estri symbol and then the number of
10:08 - time you want to iterates for example I
10:10 - want to print hello 10 times I can just
10:14 - give 10 here and I can save the program
10:17 - and I can run it once again and now you
10:20 - can see it has printed hello 10 times
10:24 - this I can do uh you know I can change
10:26 - it to 100 and it will print hello 100
10:29 - times just run it now you can see it has
10:33 - printed this hello 100 times right this
10:37 - is a short way of printing your same
10:41 - string again and again okay
10:47 - now suppose I have uh string which is a
10:52 - so I have this word for example hello
10:55 - which is assigned to a and I have the
10:58 - other variable B and I assign a number
11:02 - two to this or five to this okay and I
11:07 - want to print hello five in a single
11:11 - line how can I do this I can for example
11:15 - I can try to write it like this A + B
11:20 - but let's see what happens when I run
11:23 - this I will save it and I will run this
11:27 - and it gives me the arror
11:29 - because my variable a is of type string
11:35 - and my variable B is of type integer and
11:39 - I cannot add or can concatenate these
11:43 - two variables because the B has a
11:47 - different data type and a has a
11:49 - different data type now in order to
11:51 - print uh this these two variables
11:55 - together or value of the these two V
11:57 - variables together what I can do is I
12:00 - can typ cast my B which is a integer to
12:04 - the string and to convert my integer to
12:07 - string what I can do is I can just
12:10 - do Str Str and I can enclose this B
12:15 - variable in this function called Str Str
12:18 - and what this Str Str does is it
12:20 - converts your um argument into our
12:24 - string okay and now when I save this and
12:29 - run this it'll run fine hello five right
12:33 - so in this way you can uh use string in
12:38 - Python efficiently I hope you have
12:40 - enjoyed this video please wait comment
12:42 - and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the sixth video tutorial on Python programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how you can use string in your Python program efficiently so I think I have shown you uh in the earlier videos how to use strings uh very briefly but in this video I'm going to uh take this string in detail so I have this uh python file uh I have shown you uh in the last videos that how you can make python files and run them uh using this run Command right so I have this python file and I have this python shell open so I'm going to write my code here and uh I will see the result in this shell okay so how to use strings in Python so there are three method or three ways you can use strings and and I'm going to show you all three ways so consider this example we have three variables a b and c and all three of them I have assigned a string one string which is assigned to variable a uh is enclosed in single codes right the second string is enclosed in double codes right and the the third string which is assigned to C is enclosed in three or triple codes and I'm going trying to print all three of them one by one so I want to print a print B and print C and let's see what happens so first of all I'm going to save my program and then I will just run this module or press F5 to run it and when I press uh this run I will see the result here and the result will be the same so you can print the same string in three ways either you can use single quote or you can do or you can use uh double quotes or you can use triple quotes to print the string and the result will always be same in Python now suppose you want to uh use for example this is a string enclosed in single code and you want to use some single code here so for example I want to uh say uh I'm a single qued string and for example I want to use a word called um don't uh which also take a single quote here this kind of single code and when I use the single code which uh with the string which is inclosed already in single code then what you'll your Python program will interpret is your string starts from here and your string ends here and this will be uh some alien to your python you know Python program because uh it will think that this single quotes uh is start from here and ends here so this is a string and what is this it's not recognized by the python so whenever you want to use single code in the string which is already there inside the single code you can use a Escape character and what is the escape character in uh python Escape character in Python is backs slash so just use this backslash and now you can see that uh your back backslash is hiding or it's saying python that we want to use single code inside the string okay and this is called Escape character so in the same way when you want to use double code in the string which is already there in the double quotes for example here I want to use double quote the same problem will come here your Python program will see that your string starts here and ends here and this will be not this will not be recognized by your Python program so here also you can use back slash to hide or to uh you know say python that we are using double quotes but it's the part of the string and it's not starting or ending of the string okay in a same manner you can uh you know use single code here and you can use this back slash to uh show this backs slash or double codes here now I will save my program I will just click control s and run it once again F5 and you can see the answer is like this so I'm a single coded string and this single code is visible now here and uh just remember that this is just a Escape character so this will not be printed this will help your single code to print but this will not be printed in the same way you can see it's printing this uh double code here because we are using Escape character and in the same way it will work work uh in the third string like this now suppose you want to print this uh this Escape character so you have some string which uses this and you want to print here this backs slash how you can do it you just need to use where wherever you need to you know print this back slash so for example I will use back slash here and let's see first of all what will be the result for example I want to print back slash here here and here and I will save my program and run it by pressing F or this run python module it will show me this backslash here right but better way is to just use double slash let's see what happens when we use double slash I will save it and run the program and now it shows back slash like this so it's always better to use double slash whenever you want to print this single back slash here okay now suppose you want to print the length or you want to find find out the length of your string what you can do you can use a builtin function called Len and I think I have already uh you know shown this function to you but once again I'm going to show you so I want to find the length of uh the string a I can just use Len and I will pass my variable a as an argument and I can save it and I I can run it I will run it here here once again and now it says 34 so the length of my string a is 34 okay so in the same way you can find the length of uh B and C also right now suppose I have string a for example I have string a like this hello and space and string B is like that hello world okay and how can I join these strings I can join these strings just like you just need to use a and plus and B so plus is called a concatenation operator here and what this plus does it just add adds or concatenate these two string A and B I will save the program and run it once again and it gives me the answer hello worlds right so this plus concatenates your string you can see here now for example I have this um I have this I will just delete this and I have this variable a and I want to print it 10 times and I don't want to use you know a and then plus a once again a I want to print it 10 times or suppose I want to print it 100 times there is a short way to print uh this uh a 100 times or whatever number of times what you need to do is you just need to use your variable which contains your string and then give a estri symbol here so give this estri symbol and then the number of time you want to iterates for example I want to print hello 10 times I can just give 10 here and I can save the program and I can run it once again and now you can see it has printed hello 10 times this I can do uh you know I can change it to 100 and it will print hello 100 times just run it now you can see it has printed this hello 100 times right this is a short way of printing your same string again and again okay now suppose I have uh string which is a so I have this word for example hello which is assigned to a and I have the other variable B and I assign a number two to this or five to this okay and I want to print hello five in a single line how can I do this I can for example I can try to write it like this A + B but let's see what happens when I run this I will save it and I will run this and it gives me the arror because my variable a is of type string and my variable B is of type integer and I cannot add or can concatenate these two variables because the B has a different data type and a has a different data type now in order to print uh this these two variables together or value of the these two V variables together what I can do is I can typ cast my B which is a integer to the string and to convert my integer to string what I can do is I can just do Str Str and I can enclose this B variable in this function called Str Str and what this Str Str does is it converts your um argument into our string okay and now when I save this and run this it'll run fine hello five right so in this way you can uh use string in Python efficiently I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
