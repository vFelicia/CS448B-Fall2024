00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge and this is
00:04 - another video on how to create
00:06 - responsive contact form in PHP with
00:09 - MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so in the
00:13 - last tutorial we have laid out the basic
00:16 - structure of our contact form we have
00:18 - created the form with the ID contact -
00:22 - form method post' and action index that
00:27 - page P so we'll just change this into
00:30 - contact HP instead of index dot PHP and
00:36 - we also have defined the class or div
00:39 - with the class messages where in which
00:41 - we will display all the messages if we
00:44 - have message such as errors and
00:48 - feedbacks coming from our contact form
00:54 - so in this tutorial we will continue
00:56 - working on with this contact form and we
01:00 - will add the contact that that page be
01:04 - fine okay so we have prayed that the
01:07 - contact that PHP file and in this
01:10 - particular script we will handle the
01:13 - sending of email okay so we'll just open
01:17 - up the page P tag here so in the first
01:25 - part of this script we will configure
01:28 - basic variables that we need so the
01:30 - first one will be from the second will
01:34 - be sent to the third one will be subject
01:57 - new message from compact form another
02:02 - one will be fields so under subject
02:07 - fields and then other one is oakley
02:13 - message other one is error message and
02:27 - let's just set default values for this
02:30 - so the far a prom will be the demo
02:34 - platform and with the demo at domain.com
02:42 - we'll just set the same for the same two
02:46 - variable
02:47 - okay the open message or the okay
02:57 - message will be platform successfully
03:06 - submitted I will get back to you and the
03:21 - error message will be there worth while
03:27 - sending email this field variable is of
03:33 - type array and inside this we're gonna
03:36 - need to set few elements for name the
03:44 - second one will be learning
03:47 - [Music]
03:56 - third-best phone number or it's the
04:16 - other way around so this will be phone
04:18 - in this will have the capital P and also
04:26 - will be email so this will be message
04:41 - okay
04:45 - [Music]
04:47 - and in here we need to set the error 14
04:53 - this will be e and notice but if you
05:12 - don't need an error or thing you can
05:14 - just set this into something like error
05:17 - reporting in the inside profit or
05:21 - parentheses is the value 0 okay and our
05:28 - sending logic should be wrap around to
05:31 - try and catch block assumption and
05:38 - something horrible so first we're going
05:45 - to check if the count of our post
05:50 - variable is not equal to 0 or meaning
05:55 - the size of our post variable is not
05:59 - equal to 0 or equal to 0 then
06:03 - we'll just throw exception new text
06:14 - option form is empty okay and below this
06:33 - line we need to define a new variable
06:39 - which is email tax you have a new
06:48 - message from your demo for /in and here
07:06 - we'll just we'll just define or add a
07:12 - new for each blah and we'll pass in the
07:18 - post variable as key value pairs and
07:24 - we're just going to check if the value
07:32 - or the key is set so field reveals and
07:39 - then the key curly braces braces if the
07:47 - fields with the key is set in fields
07:52 - variable which is the array that we have
07:55 - to find a bug then we need to
07:57 - concatenate our email tax read the value
08:05 - so fields and then the key : in the
08:13 - value box /n and meet the rock this with
08:19 - double go okay save our HP file and we
08:26 - need to terminate the this particular
08:30 - line and we need to set the headers of
08:36 - our emails so headers equals sorry with
08:46 - content type X slash plain and of course
08:55 - the Carter set will be utf-8 - a and
09:16 - [Music]
09:19 - from dot from and then reply to try to
09:40 - force the originating email and return
09:50 - will also be the from variable which is
09:58 - the originating a min and and then right
10:05 - below this line we need to all on the
10:10 - method mail send to which is the
10:14 - recipient of our email the subject
10:18 - and then the email text and then we need
10:23 - to implode the headers semicolon and
10:45 - then we're sponsoring equals 3 and type
10:57 - success message will be set the optimum
11:13 - message that we have defined earlier and
11:16 - of course if there's an error or there's
11:22 - an exception we could set the response
11:24 - or into something type danger and then
11:31 - of course the message will be the error
11:33 - message that we have to find ok and
11:36 - below this line we just have to check if
11:39 - the request is by Ajax
11:42 - and then if the request is by Ajax then
11:47 - return the JSON response that we have
11:49 - defined so if not empty the server and
11:57 - then HTTP X question when
12:07 - and let's just copy this so server and
12:18 - then you are to lower server HTTP X
12:26 - requested with equals let's just check
12:30 - if this is coming from XML HTTP request
12:36 - okay and the next is to encode the
12:47 - response re spy our JSON encode instead
12:55 - of decode so response array and of
13:00 - course we need to set the header for
13:02 - this content type because application or
13:07 - see the calendar color application slash
13:12 - Jason and echo golden hey save our
13:19 - contact at PHP file and in the last
13:22 - tutorial we will continue working on
13:24 - with this form upload this to a server
13:26 - and and check if our four is working for
13:31 - them
13:31 - Thanks
13:40 - you
