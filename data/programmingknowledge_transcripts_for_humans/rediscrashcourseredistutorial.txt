With timestamps:

00:00 - so first of all what is Redis so Redis
00:02 - is an open-source BSD licensed advanced
00:06 - in-memory key value store where Keys can
00:10 - contain data structures such as strings
00:12 - hashes lists sets and sorted sets so
00:18 - it's an in-memory key value store with
00:21 - persistence that means radius can be
00:24 - used as a database or a caching layer or
00:28 - a message broker now I already said that
00:32 - its BSD license that means it's open
00:36 - source
00:37 - now Redis is written in C and it's no
00:40 - SQL database now what is no SQL no SQL
00:45 - is an informal loosely defined term for
00:49 - non-relational structured data storage
00:52 - systems like MongoDB man cached CouchDB
00:57 - or Cassandra
00:58 - so following in the footsteps of other
01:01 - no SQL databases such as Cassandra
01:04 - CouchDB or MongoDB Redis allows the user
01:09 - to store vast amount of data without the
01:13 - limits of relational databases so in no
01:16 - SQL databases data can be stored in non
01:20 - relational way now what does the name
01:22 - Redis mean ready stands for remote
01:26 - directory server it is often referred to
01:29 - as a data structure server since the
01:32 - keys can contain strings hashes lists
01:35 - sets and sorted sets so because the keys
01:39 - can contains these type of different
01:42 - data structures it's often referred as a
01:45 - data structure server right so the name
01:49 - come from remote directory server now
01:51 - what is right is used for so as I
01:55 - already mentioned that it's an advanced
01:58 - key value store that can function as a
02:01 - no SQL database or as a memory cache
02:04 - store to improve performance when
02:06 - serving data that is stored in system
02:10 - memory and also it can be used as a
02:12 - message broker so it can be used in
02:15 - place of cashing systems such as
02:17 - memcached
02:19 - now you must be wondering how to
02:20 - interact with Radice so Redis can be
02:24 - installed on a server and it can be
02:27 - interacted with a command-line tool or
02:31 - command-line interface which is called
02:33 - Redis CLI so using this Redis CLI we can
02:37 - interact with our Redis server now this
02:40 - Redis client can be used on any machine
02:44 - and then when we open this Redis client
02:47 - which is a command-line client the first
02:51 - line will look like this so Redis then
02:53 - this kind of angle bracket this we will
02:57 - see in the coming videos how to install
02:59 - Redis and how we can use Redis now let's
03:04 - talk about some of the history about
03:06 - Redis so in early 2009 our developer
03:10 - called Salvatore Sanfilippo he was an
03:14 - Italian developer by the way started the
03:17 - raddest project at that time he was
03:19 - working on a real-time web analytics
03:22 - solution and found that MySQL could not
03:26 - provide the necessary performance so in
03:28 - June 2009 Redis was deployed in
03:31 - production for a website called log comm
03:36 - which was our real-time web analytics
03:39 - website then in March 2010 a company
03:43 - called VMware hired Sanfilippo to work
03:46 - full-time on dradis although reddit
03:49 - remains as BSD licensed subsequently
03:53 - vmware hired some of the other
03:55 - developers who also contributed majorly
03:58 - to assist on the project so this was a
04:02 - brief introduction about Redis and from
04:05 - the next video we will see how we can
04:07 - install Redis and how to use Redis so
04:11 - stay tuned and please rate comment
04:13 - subscribe and bye for now
04:15 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
04:17 - register tool for beginners in this
04:19 - video I'm going to show you how you can
04:21 - download and install Redis on your
04:23 - Windows operating system so let's get
04:25 - started so
04:26 - to fall open your favorite browser and
04:29 - search for Redis and hopefully the first
04:32 - result which will appear here will be
04:34 - from Redis dot IO so you need to just
04:38 - click this link which is for the red s
04:41 - dot IO and then once you click this link
04:44 - you will be able to see the Downloads
04:47 - tab on the top of this website so let me
04:52 - just maximize this browser and I can see
04:57 - this tab which is for downloads right so
05:00 - I'm going to click this downloads tab
05:03 - and then I'm in the download section now
05:07 - when you scroll down a little you will
05:10 - see a Windows section here and there is
05:13 - a message here which says the Redis
05:16 - project does not officially support
05:18 - Windows however the Microsoft open tech
05:23 - group develops and maintains this
05:26 - Windows port targeting windows 64 so
05:30 - Redis project does not officially
05:33 - support Windows but there is a group of
05:36 - developers which makes it available for
05:39 - Windows so we just need to click this
05:42 - link which says learn more and when you
05:45 - click this link you will be redirected
05:47 - to a github page of Redis which is
05:52 - maintained by Microsoft Archive so once
05:56 - you reach to this page and scroll a
05:58 - little down and reach to the readme dot
06:03 - MD here on the third line you will be
06:07 - able to see this message which says you
06:11 - can download the latest unsigned binary
06:14 - and unsigned MSI installer from this
06:18 - page so there is a link for the release
06:22 - page right so just click this link which
06:25 - says release page and then you will be
06:28 - redirected to the downloads page for
06:32 - Redis for Windows right now when you
06:35 - scroll down a little here here are few
06:38 - options to download
06:39 - a Redis on your Windows operating system
06:41 - the first option is by using dot MSI
06:45 - file which is our installer second
06:48 - option is by using our zip file so all
06:50 - the binaries will be backed in this zip
06:53 - file and you need to set up the
06:55 - environment variable so I'm going to
06:58 - show you both the ways so let's start
07:01 - with the dot zip file so I'm going to
07:04 - download this dot zip file first of all
07:06 - and I'm going to minimize the browser
07:08 - and here in downloads I can see this zip
07:11 - file so what I will do is I will create
07:15 - a new folder I'm making this folder in
07:18 - my downloads directory itself and I will
07:22 - name it as Redis but you are free to
07:26 - create this directory anywhere wherever
07:29 - you wish right and then I'm going to
07:32 - extract this zip file inside this Redis
07:37 - folder so let me drag this to this Redis
07:41 - folder this zip file and then I'm going
07:43 - to just extract all files inside this
07:48 - Redis folder right so it's going to
07:51 - extract all the files it's not really
07:54 - big file so it will be extracted really
07:57 - soon and you can see all the files are
08:00 - extracted inside this Redis folder and
08:04 - there is a Redis minus X 64 minus 3.2
08:10 - 3.2 is the latest version at the time of
08:13 - making this video so inside this Redis
08:17 - folder there are some files so these
08:21 - files are all are important but to our
08:24 - of our interest
08:26 - one is Redis server and another is ready
08:31 - CLI so let me minimize this other window
08:34 - here and then I'm going to double click
08:37 - on this Redis - server Exe file so I'm
08:41 - going to double click on this Redis
08:44 - server which is going to start the Redis
08:46 - server and it will ask you to give the
08:50 - administrative privileges or you need to
08:52 - allow the access to
08:53 - the server so here I'm going to just
08:56 - press this button it says allow access
08:59 - and now the Redis server has been
09:01 - started now the default port on which
09:04 - the Redis server start is this one which
09:07 - is six three seven nine okay so this is
09:11 - the default port on which Redis starts
09:14 - on the localhost and then this is the
09:18 - PID of this Redis server right now next
09:22 - I'm going to start the Redis see Li to
09:24 - interact with this server so now this
09:27 - time click on this red is CLI and it's
09:31 - going to start another terminal and it's
09:34 - going to connect to this Redis server
09:37 - and then using this CLI you will be able
09:42 - to interact with this server right so
09:45 - this is the client and server is running
09:48 - in the background right so let me
09:50 - minimize this window also and let me
09:54 - just place this server here and let me
09:57 - open this client on the right hand side
10:00 - right
10:00 - so this is the server and this is the
10:02 - client now in this client when you write
10:06 - ping you will get the response pong so
10:09 - you can see I'm getting the response
10:11 - pong
10:12 - that means the server is running fine
10:15 - and my client is able to connect to the
10:18 - server and get the response right now in
10:22 - order to save something as a key value
10:25 - pair for testing we can just write set
10:28 - and then it's going to give you some
10:31 - intelligence also so I just wrote a
10:33 - keyword set and it gives me the hint
10:36 - that I need to give the key value pair
10:39 - here so as a key I will give a name or
10:43 - name key + i will give any name as a
10:48 - value so for example mark i mean to give
10:51 - as a name right and then i'm going to
10:54 - press enter and it says okay that means
10:57 - this key value that means name is our
11:00 - key and mark is the value of the name
11:04 - which is the value right so to get the
11:07 - value you can just write get and then
11:10 - the name of the key which is name itself
11:12 - in our case and press ENTER and it's
11:16 - going to give us the value right so that
11:20 - means everything is working fine and we
11:23 - are able to connect to the brightest
11:25 - server and it's able to save the values
11:29 - right
11:29 - but sometimes or most of the times you
11:33 - will not go to this server and start
11:37 - from this directory right so you want to
11:41 - you know open your command line from
11:44 - your windows and you want to connect
11:48 - from this command terminal from windows
11:51 - not from this location right so in order
11:55 - to do that you need to set the
11:57 - environment variables so let's set the
12:00 - environment variables for this Redis
12:03 - client and server so we will be able to
12:06 - open this Redis server and read its
12:09 - client from our windows terminal so in
12:13 - order to do this you just need to
12:15 - right-click on your this PC so just
12:18 - right click on this PC and then go to
12:21 - the properties and once this properties
12:25 - window is open we will go to the
12:27 - Advanced Settings so just click this
12:31 - option which says advanced system
12:33 - settings and once this advanced system
12:37 - setting is open we are going to go to
12:39 - the environment variables just click
12:42 - this option which says environment
12:43 - variables and once the environment
12:46 - variables is open you just need to
12:48 - select this option under the system
12:50 - variable which is for path so just
12:53 - double click on this option which says
12:56 - path and here we just need to give a new
12:59 - environment variable and this new
13:02 - environment variable is the path to your
13:05 - Redis folder where your server and Redis
13:10 - CL is there so you just need to copy
13:12 - this part where this Redis server
13:15 - executable file is there and ready CLI
13:18 - file is there so I'm just
13:20 - to copy this part and then into this
13:23 - environment variable I will just create
13:25 - a new variable so I will just click new
13:27 - and then I will paste this part right
13:30 - and then press ENTER and then click OK
13:34 - and then once again click OK and then
13:38 - once again click OK right so now the
13:42 - environment variable for Redis so it's
13:46 - set so now I will just close these two
13:48 - terminals right and then I'm going to
13:51 - open the command line so to open my
13:55 - windows terminal I can right click on
13:58 - this windows icon so just right click on
14:00 - the windows icon and then open the
14:03 - command prompt you can open the command
14:05 - prompt from here also or with the admin
14:08 - privileges so I'm going to open the
14:10 - command prompt with the admin privileges
14:13 - and once the command prompt is open I
14:15 - can start the server from this command
14:18 - prompt so to start the server you just
14:20 - need to write Redis - server which is
14:24 - the executable file here right so I'm
14:27 - going to just write Redis - server and
14:32 - then press Enter which is going to start
14:34 - the Redis server right so because we
14:37 - have set the environment variable now we
14:40 - can start the server from the command
14:43 - prompt from windows from any location
14:46 - right now in order to start the client
14:50 - we will open another command prompt and
14:54 - then we can start this with the Redis
14:59 - CLI command so I'm going to just write
15:01 - Redis - CLI and then press Enter and
15:05 - then we are connected to this server
15:08 - right now once again I can set any value
15:12 - here so for example set and then any
15:15 - name or any key I'm going to say this
15:19 - time the key is any number so I'm going
15:24 - to just write number and then any number
15:28 - for example 50 here right and then press
15:30 - ENTER and then I'm going to get numb
15:34 - number and then press ENTER and is going
15:38 - to give us the value of this number
15:40 - which is 50 right so in this way also
15:43 - you can start your ready server and
15:46 - Redis client okay now in case if you are
15:51 - wondering how we can install this Redis
15:55 - on our Windows operating system using
15:59 - this MSI file which is the more easier
16:02 - version we can just download this MSI
16:05 - file and once this MSI file is
16:07 - downloaded I'm going to go to the
16:09 - location where it's downloaded and once
16:13 - this location is open I'm going to
16:14 - install it so I'm going to minimize my
16:17 - browser and I can see that this MSI file
16:21 - is there in my downloads folder so I'm
16:23 - going to double click on this MSI file
16:25 - and once this MSI file installer starts
16:30 - we just need to click some next button
16:33 - to install it so just wait for some
16:37 - seconds to start the wizard and we just
16:40 - need to click Next here and then just
16:42 - accept terms and condition and then
16:44 - click Next and this is the location
16:47 - where Redis will be installed on your
16:49 - system and then this is the important
16:53 - step so it will ask you if you want to
16:56 - add Redis installation folder to your
16:59 - environment variables so this installer
17:02 - will automatically add the Redis path to
17:06 - the environment variable if you check
17:08 - this option which is more easier also
17:10 - right and then click Next
17:12 - and this is the default port as I
17:16 - already said 6 3 7 9 and then it says
17:20 - add an exception to the firewall we can
17:24 - just click Next here and then we will
17:27 - just set the memory as default and click
17:31 - Next and just click install right so
17:35 - it's going to start installing and some
17:38 - seconds Redis will be installed on your
17:40 - system and once it's installed then you
17:43 - will be able to start Redis from your
17:45 - command
17:46 - once again so once again for example I
17:49 - am going to open the command prompt and
17:52 - then I will give the Redis CLI command
17:55 - so I'm going to just write Redis - CLI
17:59 - and it's automatically has been started
18:03 - and when I just write ping I will get
18:07 - the response pong so you may be
18:10 - wondering that this time I haven't
18:12 - started the Redis server so if you use
18:16 - the Redis installer MSI file to install
18:20 - Redis the server will be automatically
18:23 - started and you don't need to explicitly
18:26 - start the server you just need to
18:29 - connect to the server using the Redis
18:30 - CLI so you just need to open the command
18:33 - prompt and then using Redis CLI you can
18:36 - connect to that server which is already
18:38 - been started by that installer
18:42 - automatically right so this time we
18:44 - don't need to start the server it's
18:46 - already has been started we just need
18:49 - the ready CLI to connect to it so these
18:51 - are the two ways which you can use to
18:53 - install Redis on your Windows operating
18:56 - system hey guys welcome to the next
18:58 - video on register todel for beginners in
19:00 - this video I'm going to show you how you
19:02 - can download and install ready on our
19:04 - Linux operating system for this
19:07 - demonstration I will be using Ubuntu
19:09 - operating system so let's get started so
19:12 - there are two ways of installing Redis
19:15 - on our Ubuntu operating system so first
19:19 - of all we can use apt-get install to
19:22 - install Redis but there is a
19:26 - disadvantage of installing Redis using
19:29 - app cat and that is the version you will
19:33 - install so with apt-get whenever you use
19:37 - app cat to install Redis the
19:40 - repositories are not updated frequently
19:43 - as the Redis version is released so you
19:48 - will be able to see that you have
19:50 - installed the older version of Redis if
19:54 - you use apt-get command so for example
19:57 - let's go to
19:59 - this website so search for Redis and the
20:03 - first result which will appear here will
20:05 - be from Redis dot IO and we will see the
20:08 - version of for Redis right now so as I
20:11 - can see here the red is for point zero
20:14 - point zero is the latest version right
20:17 - and we can see using the apt-get command
20:21 - so I'm going to open the terminal here
20:23 - in Ubuntu and here I can just type at -
20:28 - cash - no the version of Redis available
20:32 - right so just write app cache and then
20:35 - policy and then the ready server so just
20:39 - write Redis - server okay
20:42 - and then press ENTER and then you will
20:45 - be able to see the version so as far as
20:48 - I can see the version available using
20:51 - apt-get command will be 2.8 or something
20:56 - near to that right for my Ubuntu
21:00 - operating system it may be different if
21:02 - you have the more newest version of open
21:05 - - I have Ubuntu 14.04 but if you have
21:09 - for example ubuntu 16.04 or ubuntu 17.04
21:16 - it may be little bit better this version
21:19 - but it will not be the latest version
21:22 - which is four point zero point zero in
21:25 - most of the cases right
21:27 - so if you want the easiest way then you
21:31 - can just write sudo apt - get install
21:35 - Redis - server okay
21:39 - and then once you press ENTER it's going
21:42 - to install ready server on your open to
21:45 - operating system but the version of this
21:48 - ubuntu server will be 2.8 right so in
21:51 - this case i'm going to show you how you
21:53 - can install the latest version of Redis
21:56 - so for that I'm going to just clear the
22:00 - terminal let's go to the website once
22:02 - again so I'm on the red s dot IO website
22:05 - and I will just click downloads here and
22:08 - then I will go little bit down and I can
22:12 - see the
22:13 - for point zero point zero and I will
22:16 - scroll a little more down and I can see
22:20 - this installation step here and here
22:24 - it's using W get to get this zip file
22:29 - and then we need to unzip the zip file
22:32 - and then we will do CD and then we will
22:36 - make the Redis binaries right so this is
22:40 - the procedure for installing Redis on a
22:44 - Linux operating system or a Mac
22:46 - operating system this procedure will be
22:49 - almost the same right so let's open that
22:51 - terminal first of all and then once the
22:54 - terminal is open we are going to install
22:57 - two packages here one is the build
23:00 - essential package and the other is the
23:02 - TCL package build essential package we
23:05 - use to compile our binaries for the
23:09 - raddest server and TCL package we will
23:11 - use to test our binaries okay so first
23:15 - of all we will give this command sudo
23:17 - apt - get update first of all we will
23:22 - update all the repositories and I'm
23:24 - going to give my Ubuntu password so
23:26 - updates is done I'm going to just clear
23:29 - the terminal once again and this time I
23:32 - will give sudo app - get install build
23:36 - essential and TCL okay and then press
23:40 - ENTER which is going to install these
23:43 - two packages in my case I can see both
23:46 - the packages are already installed so if
23:49 - they are already installed you will see
23:52 - these kind of message that they are
23:53 - already installed otherwise if they are
23:56 - not present they will be installed on
23:57 - your system
23:58 - so first of all give this command to
24:01 - install these two packages and then once
24:04 - again let me clear the terminal and then
24:06 - we are ready to install Redis using
24:09 - these command which are there on the
24:12 - Redis dot IO website right so the first
24:15 - command is just to download this tar
24:18 - file so what we are going to do is I'm
24:22 - going to first of all make a Redis
24:24 - folder so let me make
24:27 - this folder and kdi are Redis and then I
24:31 - will CD to this Redis folder or
24:35 - directory and inside this directory I'm
24:38 - going to give this w get command which I
24:41 - copied from the Redis website so let me
24:43 - just maximize the terminal and just give
24:48 - this command so w get HTTP download
24:51 - whatever version of the Redis you are
24:54 - downloading so at the time of making
24:56 - this video four point zero point zero is
24:58 - the latest version so you can see this
25:01 - version 4.0 point zero right otherwise
25:04 - this version will be different in your
25:06 - case if the latest version is released
25:08 - right so this just give this command and
25:12 - then press Enter it is going to download
25:14 - this tar file you can see the star
25:17 - profile is downloaded and then let me
25:20 - clear the terminal once again let me do
25:22 - LS once again and now we are going to
25:25 - give the tar command to unzip this tar
25:30 - file so just give this command copy and
25:34 - paste nothing else and then once again
25:36 - LS and you can see this red is for point
25:40 - zero point zero directory is extracted
25:42 - and then we will go inside
25:45 - this Redis directory CD to this
25:48 - directory and then we just need to give
25:51 - them make command so just give make
25:54 - command so just right make here and then
25:57 - press enter which is going to start the
26:01 - making of this Redis binaries it can
26:06 - take some time so just wait for the
26:09 - process to complete so now I can see the
26:12 - make command is successfully completed
26:14 - and at the end of the make command I can
26:17 - see this message which says it's good
26:20 - idea to run make tests after this make
26:23 - come on so I'm going to run make test
26:26 - now so I'm going to just give make test
26:29 - command and then press ENTER and let it
26:31 - run so now the make test command is also
26:34 - finished so now let's go to the next
26:37 - step so I'm going to the website
26:40 - so make test is finished and now it says
26:43 - we just need to go to the source and we
26:46 - need to start the Redis server using the
26:50 - source folder and then Redis server okay
26:54 - and ready CLI will be started from
26:57 - source read is CLI right so let's start
27:01 - ready server first of all so let's do LS
27:05 - here and I can see this source directory
27:08 - right so I can just start the Redis
27:11 - server like this so you just need to
27:14 - give SRC /r Addis so okay and then press
27:20 - Enter which is going to start the Redis
27:22 - server and you can see the Redis server
27:25 - has been started I will just move it to
27:28 - the left hand side this command line
27:31 - terminal and now I will open the next
27:33 - terminal so let me open the next
27:35 - terminal and then in this next terminal
27:39 - I'm going to start the red disk line so
27:42 - I will just go to the Red List directory
27:44 - once again where I have installed or
27:48 - created the binaries and then I will go
27:51 - to the Redis directory and then I will
27:55 - give this Redis command so SRC and then
27:59 - forward slash red as I think so let me
28:03 - do LS once again and yes SRC is here so
28:07 - I will give SRC forward slash Redis
28:12 - client or CLI I think yeah so ready CLI
28:17 - let me just make it a little bit bigger
28:20 - so we can see it perfectly so now you
28:24 - can see we are connected to the server
28:26 - using this IP address and on this port
28:29 - so you can see the Redis server was
28:32 - started on this default port 6 3 7 9 and
28:36 - we are connected to this port using the
28:38 - Redis CLI so let's set something so I'm
28:42 - going to set for example name max for
28:46 - example and then press Enter
28:49 - and it says ok and now I will just say
28:52 - GATT name and its
28:54 - to give me the name max so everything is
28:57 - working fine but one more thing we can
29:01 - do here is because we have installed
29:03 - Redis on some directory on a particular
29:08 - directory every time we need to start
29:10 - Redis we need to CD to that directory
29:14 - and then we need to start the server and
29:17 - we don't want that we want that whenever
29:21 - we give the Redis server command from
29:24 - any directory
29:26 - we just need to start the Redis server
29:28 - so in order to do this what we need to
29:30 - do is let me just minimize this and let
29:34 - me just make some eyes this terminal and
29:36 - we are inside the raddest directory as
29:39 - you already know and you can see the SRC
29:43 - folder is already here right so this is
29:47 - the SRC folder now the last command you
29:50 - can give here is make install so that
29:54 - whenever you give Redis server command
29:56 - from anywhere from any directory it will
29:59 - start the server and know you don't need
30:01 - to navigate to this particular directory
30:04 - in order to start the Redis service so
30:07 - just give make install command in order
30:10 - to install ready server and the ready
30:12 - CLI so let's do that and it says that
30:17 - cannot create regular file because the
30:20 - permissions are denied permission denied
30:23 - that means I need to give the sudo
30:26 - command before the make install so just
30:28 - give sudo make install command here okay
30:32 - so you just need to give sudo make
30:35 - install command and then once again
30:38 - press enter and now the Redis server and
30:42 - ready CLI and other stuff which are
30:45 - there inside this SRC folder is
30:48 - installed right so let me just close
30:52 - this terminal and let me open the fresh
30:55 - terminal now and we are not inside that
30:58 - Redis directory right we are in our home
31:01 - folder and then from here I will just
31:03 - give Redis server command and
31:07 - it will start the server so I don't need
31:10 - to navigate to that's that Redis direct
31:13 - tree because Redis is now installed on
31:16 - on my system in a same way I can start
31:19 - the client so I will just start a new
31:21 - terminal and I will just give Redis -
31:25 - CLI to connect to it and I am connected
31:29 - right so in this way you can download
31:31 - and install Redis on your one - Linux
31:35 - operating system hey guys in this video
31:37 - I'm going to show you how you can
31:39 - download and install Redis on your Mac
31:42 - operating system so let's just start it
31:44 - and let's see how we can install Redis
31:46 - on our Mac so first of all open up your
31:49 - favorite browser and search for Redis
31:51 - and the first link which will appear
31:53 - here will be from Redis dot IO so we
31:56 - will just click this link which is ready
31:58 - Scott IO and here we can see the
32:02 - homepage of Redis what we want to do
32:05 - here is we want to go to that downloads
32:08 - section so we will just click this
32:11 - option which says download and then when
32:15 - we scroll down a little we can see this
32:18 - downloads button but don't click this
32:21 - download button yet we will see how to
32:23 - install Redis on our Mac while scrolling
32:27 - or down a little so when we scroll down
32:31 - a little here you can see the
32:34 - installation steps for read is so first
32:36 - we need to download the star file and
32:39 - then we need to unzip or unter this tar
32:44 - file and then we need to make the Redis
32:48 - binaries right now let's see what is the
32:51 - latest version at the time of making
32:53 - this video for the Redis so we can see
32:57 - in the Downloads button that four point
33:01 - zero point zero is the latest stable
33:04 - version at the time of making this video
33:06 - right so we will install the four point
33:09 - zero point zero version of Redis now
33:12 - sometimes this dublicate command may not
33:17 - work on your Mac operating system
33:20 - so we will use the curl command to
33:23 - download the star file okay so instead
33:26 - of W gate we will use the curl command
33:28 - and then we will follow the same
33:32 - procedure as described here with some
33:35 - additional commands okay so what we will
33:40 - do first is on my desktop for example or
33:43 - at your chosen location just create a
33:47 - folder so I'm going to create a folder
33:49 - and I'm going to name it as Redis okay
33:53 - so inside this Redis directory I'm going
33:57 - to just download this tar file and unter
34:01 - it and then make the binary is out of it
34:03 - okay so then once I have this folder I
34:08 - will just see the info get the info and
34:11 - then just see what is the path of this
34:15 - Redis directory and I'm going to copy it
34:18 - and then I'm going to open our terminal
34:21 - so just open a terminal and then just CD
34:25 - to this Redis directory so because it's
34:28 - on my desktop I can just use this old
34:33 - location so user and then whatever is
34:35 - your username and then forward slash
34:38 - desktop and then forward slash all Redis
34:42 - I just need to write for slash Redis and
34:45 - then I'm inside this red is folder right
34:49 - now we will do the LS and there is
34:53 - nothing inside this Redis folder and
34:55 - let's just open this folder so we will
34:58 - see what's happening inside this folder
35:01 - okay so let me just resize it so we will
35:06 - see all the things which are happening
35:08 - here and now we will just give a curl
35:11 - command so just write curl and then - oh
35:15 - and then the location of this tar file
35:21 - so just copy this URL from here which is
35:26 - there on the downloads page without W
35:29 - get okay so just copy this you
35:33 - and then paste it here on the terminal
35:37 - and then press Enter which is going to
35:39 - download this star file and once it's
35:42 - downloaded we will just unter it so you
35:46 - can see the star file is downloaded
35:49 - right and to untie rate or extract it we
35:54 - will use this command so right click
35:57 - copy and then just paste it here which
36:03 - is going to extract this tar file and we
36:07 - can see this folder is extracted and
36:11 - inside this folder we have some files
36:15 - right so the next step is to CD to this
36:19 - directory which is read is minus four
36:22 - point zero point zero and then make it
36:24 - right so you can see the step CD to this
36:28 - four point zero point zero directory and
36:30 - give them make command so we will do the
36:32 - same CD to the where is four point zero
36:36 - point zero directory and then give a
36:39 - make command which is going to make the
36:42 - binaries for the Redis over and let
36:45 - Reddy's client and other Redis stuff
36:48 - right so now the make is finished and at
36:52 - last I can see this message which says
36:55 - it's a good idea to run make test so
36:58 - let's run make test I'm going to just
37:01 - give this command we just make test and
37:03 - then plus enter so now the make test
37:06 - command is also finished and I can see
37:08 - this message which says all tests passed
37:10 - without error right so I know that
37:14 - everything is okay and now I can start
37:17 - the Redis server and then Redis client
37:20 - okay so let's see what are the command
37:23 - for those so whether server can be
37:27 - started from the source directory and we
37:30 - just need to run this command which is
37:32 - ready server and same we need to do for
37:36 - Redis client so from the source
37:38 - directory we can just run this Redis CLI
37:42 - right so let's do this so I'm going to
37:46 - open a new terminal so let me open a new
37:51 - terminal so now I have two terminals
37:54 - right so on the first terminal I will
37:57 - just do first of all LS here or let me
38:01 - clear the terminal first of all so clear
38:03 - and then I will do LS here and I can see
38:06 - there is a source directory here so I
38:09 - will just get this command SRC and then
38:14 - red is - so right so red is - server and
38:21 - press enter which is going to start the
38:24 - ready server and it has started
38:27 - listening on this port which is the
38:29 - default port for Redis which is 6 3 7 9
38:33 - and this is the PID of this Redis server
38:36 - right now once again I will navigate to
38:40 - this directory where I have installed
38:42 - Redis so it's in my desktop and then
38:47 - I'll go to the reddits directory then
38:49 - the red is for point zero point zero and
38:52 - then I will just give this command which
38:56 - is SRC forward slash right as CLI so let
39:01 - me do LS so I know that I am in the same
39:05 - directory and then I will just write SRC
39:09 - and then red is CLI and I'm connected to
39:14 - the Redis server I can see this kind of
39:18 - prompt here that means I'm connected to
39:21 - my already server right so first to test
39:25 - whether everything is working fine or
39:28 - not you just need to write in here and
39:31 - then press ENTER and if in return you
39:35 - get pong then you know that everything
39:38 - is working fine you can also set
39:41 - something so for example set name is
39:44 - equal to max' and then press Enter and
39:47 - then you can get the name so get name
39:52 - and then you can get the name okay and
39:55 - then you can give the save command to
39:58 - save everything for example
40:01 - so everything is working fine but for
40:05 - example when I open a new terminal and I
40:09 - want to run Raditz CLI for example from
40:12 - here how can I do it so I just want to
40:15 - write Redis - CLI and I want to run it
40:21 - so let me just correct the spelling here
40:24 - so where does CLI and I want to run it
40:27 - and it says command not found because
40:31 - right now the raddest CLI command can be
40:35 - only run from this directory right so
40:38 - you need to CD to this directory and
40:41 - then run the Redis c'mon
40:44 - so how to solve this problem so this
40:46 - problem can be solved by running the
40:48 - make install command inside your
40:51 - registry so I'm going to just stop the
40:55 - server for now and now I will once again
40:59 - do for example PWDs so you know that in
41:04 - which directory I am in so I'm in my
41:06 - Redis four point zero point zero
41:09 - directory right let me clear the
41:12 - terminal so you will be able to see
41:14 - better so PWD present working directory
41:17 - and you can see I am in my desktop
41:22 - directory and then there is a Redis
41:24 - directory here
41:25 - which is this one and then we are in the
41:29 - raddest for point zero point zero
41:31 - directory right so we have run here the
41:35 - make and make test command and you just
41:38 - need to write make install command here
41:41 - with the sudo privileges so you just
41:46 - need to write sudo make install here and
41:48 - then press enter and you just need to
41:52 - give your max password here and then
41:54 - press enter and then it will start the
41:58 - make install command and then you can
42:02 - see everything is installed and now you
42:05 - can run ready server and red is CLI from
42:10 - anywhere right so let me just close
42:14 - this terminal and close this terminal
42:16 - also let me just terminate everything
42:19 - and I will open a new terminal so that
42:24 - we can check whether it's running from
42:26 - any other place other than this Redis
42:30 - folder or not so I will start to
42:33 - thermals in the first terminal I will
42:36 - write Redis server and it starts from my
42:41 - home directory and now I will give the
42:44 - Redis CLI command so just give it a CLI
42:48 - and then I'm connected to this server
42:51 - right so everything is working fine and
42:55 - now you can start already server and you
42:59 - can use why this CLI command from
43:01 - anywhere from your directory structure
43:05 - right so in this way you can download
43:07 - and install Redis on your Mac operating
43:10 - system hey guys welcome to the next
43:12 - video on register troll for beginners in
43:14 - the last few videos we have seen how we
43:17 - can download and install Redis on our
43:19 - Windows Linux and Mac operating system
43:22 - now further videos I will be making on
43:25 - my Linux operating system that is my
43:28 - open to operating system because more
43:31 - frequently or most frequently this Redis
43:34 - server is installed on a Linux machine
43:38 - and it's used from a Linux machine so it
43:42 - will be more appropriate to go further
43:44 - with this Linux operating system but all
43:48 - the command which I'm will be using on
43:50 - this Linux operating system using the
43:52 - command line are applicable on the
43:54 - Windows terminal also and the Mac
43:57 - terminal also so the command will not
43:59 - change and you just need to start the
44:02 - Redis server and ready CLI on your
44:05 - Windows or Mac OS and then follow these
44:08 - instruction which I'm giving on my human
44:12 - to operating system so if you are on
44:14 - Windows or Mac you just need to follow
44:16 - the same steps you just need to open two
44:20 - terminals on your operating system it
44:23 - can be Mac or it can be
44:27 - your windows and of course the Linux and
44:30 - on one terminal you just need to start
44:33 - the Redis server so I'm going to just
44:37 - start the Redis server here and on the
44:40 - other one you just need to start the
44:43 - Redis CLI okay so looks simple right the
44:48 - same step you need to do on your windows
44:51 - or your Mac ok so once our server is
44:54 - running we can minimize this and start
44:58 - working to interact with the server
45:01 - using the Redis CLI okay now let's start
45:05 - with the data types which are there in
45:09 - Redis and then we will see how we can
45:12 - use one of the data type which is string
45:15 - so basically there are five data types
45:17 - which we can use in Redis and as I
45:21 - already told you that Redis is a key
45:24 - value storage so the key is printable
45:29 - ASCII right and it can be up to 512
45:34 - megabyte so it can take a really big key
45:39 - for example and it should be a printable
45:41 - ASCII and then we can see the data types
45:44 - of values so the values can be strings
45:48 - and then the containers of string so
45:52 - they can be hashes or lists or sets or
45:57 - sorted sets right so the key are
46:00 - printable ASCII is we can use printable
46:04 - ASCII is for keys and for values we can
46:06 - use strings hashes less sets and sorted
46:11 - sets right and this ready string can be
46:16 - up to 512 megabyte ok now let's start
46:21 - with the practical example so we will
46:26 - start with the basics and we will try to
46:29 - set some values and get some values so
46:33 - for example I have set some values
46:36 - already to this right
46:39 - server so what I will do is to get all
46:44 - the keys which are set you just need to
46:47 - write keys and then the pattern which is
46:51 - s tricks here so Asterix is a wild card
46:54 - and it's going to search all the keys
46:58 - which are saved in your database and
47:01 - then give you the results so for example
47:05 - I have set two keys which is name and
47:08 - name - and it has given me both the keys
47:13 - which I have saved right so in order to
47:16 - see all the keys which are saved in your
47:20 - Redis database you just need to write
47:22 - keys and Astrix right now as I already
47:27 - told you that to set some value as a
47:31 - string you just need to use set and then
47:35 - a key for example in this case I'm going
47:38 - to write name 3 because name and name
47:43 - one is already set so I'm going to just
47:45 - set the third key which is name 3 and
47:48 - then I'm going to give some name right
47:52 - and then press ENTER and then once again
47:54 - I will just write keys as tricks and now
47:59 - I can see there are 3 keys stored in my
48:03 - database right so set is to set a string
48:07 - value and as you have already guessed
48:11 - from my previous videos I've shown you
48:13 - this command which is get command and
48:15 - whatever a key you will write here it
48:19 - will give you the value of that key
48:21 - which is Mark in this case right in the
48:26 - same way you can do name to get name -
48:29 - and it's going to give you the value of
48:31 - name - ok so get and set we are already
48:34 - clear now there is a delete command del
48:38 - ok so using a del and the key name we
48:43 - can delete some key value pair so for
48:46 - example I want to delete name - for now
48:49 - and then I will just press Enter
48:52 - is going to give me the number of keys
48:56 - affected and in this case there is only
49:00 - one key with the name - and now when I
49:03 - just do this command which is keys
49:07 - Astrix now it just gives me two values
49:11 - which is name and name three and because
49:15 - name - he is already deleted so I will
49:19 - not see this name - again right in the
49:23 - same way for example I want to delete
49:26 - name three key then also I can do del
49:31 - and then name three and then press enter
49:35 - and I can see the result one he affected
49:38 - and then now only one key left which is
49:43 - name okay so this is how you can delete
49:47 - some value right now let's set these
49:50 - names once again so for example name Tom
49:53 - and once again do the gate for example
49:56 - get name now you will see that the key
50:00 - value of name is overwritten with the
50:05 - name Tom so previously the value of name
50:09 - was mark you can see here and now it's
50:13 - Tom so whenever you set the value of
50:19 - previously set key then whatever value
50:23 - you will give for this key will be
50:26 - overwritten right so value will be
50:29 - overwritten for that key now for example
50:31 - if you want to delete all the values
50:34 - which are stored in our Redis database
50:36 - then we can use flush all command so for
50:39 - example I will set some more values or
50:42 - to see this example for example name -
50:45 - is equal to John and then I'm going to
50:49 - give name 3 is equal to max so now we
50:54 - have 3 names so we can just give keys
50:57 - and Astrix to see that so we have 3 keys
51:01 - stored right now for example I want to
51:04 - delete all these keys then I can give
51:07 - flush also just right flush all command
51:12 - and then it's going to delete all the
51:14 - values so it says okay and then once
51:16 - again when we give keys Asterix
51:19 - then you can see empty list or set so
51:23 - all the values are deleted using flush
51:26 - all command so these are some of the
51:30 - most frequently used commands which we
51:33 - can use with the strings in the next
51:36 - video also we will see some of the more
51:39 - commands which we can use with the
51:42 - string values hey guys welcome to the
51:45 - next video on register troll for
51:46 - beginners in the last video we have seen
51:48 - how we can use some of the command with
51:51 - the string values now in this video also
51:53 - we will see some more command which we
51:55 - can use with the string values in Redis
51:59 - so let's get started first of all I will
52:02 - show you one command which is valid in
52:05 - Linux terminal also which is the clear
52:08 - command so when you do clear it's going
52:13 - to clear your terminal right so you can
52:15 - see when I have given the clear command
52:18 - it's going to clear the terminal and
52:21 - basically what it does is it just gives
52:24 - some of the some space in between your
52:28 - last command which you have executed and
52:31 - this after this clear okay so now you
52:36 - can see this terminal is totally empty
52:40 - now right and now we can start executing
52:44 - some of the other command so right now
52:46 - our database is totally empty I think so
52:50 - we can check it with keys
52:52 - Astrix and now let's set some values and
52:55 - this time we can use a command which is
53:00 - called set e^x okay and this set e^x is
53:06 - the command which we can use with second
53:10 - so you just need to write set e^x and
53:13 - this means set the value with the expiry
53:17 - of the key okay and then for example I
53:21 - just give the key and then I need to
53:24 - give some second so you can see the next
53:28 - option I need to give here is the number
53:30 - of seconds I want this key to live in my
53:35 - raddest database and after that it will
53:38 - be automatically deleted so for example
53:40 - 10 second I want to give here and then I
53:44 - want to give the value of it for example
53:47 - max okay now when I just press ENTER
53:53 - it's going to say ok and when I just get
53:58 - name it's there right and then there is
54:02 - a command called TTL and then you can
54:05 - use the key with this and it says - and
54:09 - what is this - so TTL is the command for
54:14 - time to live so it will check for how
54:19 - much time or how long is this key is
54:23 - going to live okay and it says two
54:25 - seconds okay so this is time to live and
54:29 - then the key and then it returns us to
54:33 - second because eight Tests eight second
54:36 - has already passed often after giving
54:38 - this command and once again for example
54:41 - I will just say get name and it's no
54:46 - longer there right because we have just
54:49 - set ten-second expiry on this key so
54:54 - after 10 second it will be automatically
54:55 - deleted right for example I will just
54:59 - give 50 second expiry for example here
55:02 - so 5-0 max and then I will just give a
55:07 - TTL and then name and then you can see
55:11 - it shows 44 seconds once again 40 second
55:16 - and then it will show you the seconds
55:20 - for which this key is going to live okay
55:23 - and after 36 second it will be deleted
55:27 - right so these are two more command
55:29 - which you can use with the string right
55:32 - now let's set one
55:34 - more value for example set name - and
55:39 - name - is equal to Tom okay and now we
55:45 - can for example override this value so i
55:49 - stoled you whenever you write something
55:51 - like this set name - and some other name
55:56 - for example john then it will overwrite
56:00 - the value of name - for example I take
56:05 - name - as my key and give some other
56:08 - value it will overwrite but if you don't
56:10 - know if name - is there and if you don't
56:14 - want to overwrite name - then you can
56:17 - use this command called set and X and
56:20 - this set annex first of all checks if
56:23 - the this key is available or not and if
56:27 - this key is not available then only it's
56:29 - going to you know create this key
56:32 - otherwise it's going to just ignore
56:35 - right so let's give this come on and it
56:39 - says 0 0 because no key is affected due
56:45 - to this command that means when we do
56:48 - get name - we can see this name is not
56:54 - overwritten because this command is used
56:58 - or will be successful when this key is
57:02 - not available in the database right if
57:06 - it's available then it's going to just
57:09 - ignore and if it's not available then
57:12 - it's going to create a new value for
57:13 - example I will just give set and X 3 and
57:19 - this value is not available there so I
57:23 - will just give some other name and it
57:26 - says integer 1 that means one value is
57:30 - affected and then I will just do keys
57:34 - Astrix to see the values okay and I can
57:38 - see name - is there and name 3 is there
57:41 - that means this was successful right and
57:44 - I can also get the value from
57:48 - get name three also and I can see that
57:51 - value is there let me clear this
57:54 - terminal now if you want to know the
57:56 - length of the value stored in the key
57:59 - then you can just use STR le M command
58:04 - okay and then the key name for example
58:06 - name - and it's going to give you the
58:08 - length of that key that means for
58:12 - example I do get name - here you can see
58:16 - it's a three character word and that's
58:19 - the length of this value right and
58:21 - that's the result here okay now for
58:24 - example if you want to set multiple
58:26 - values with the same command we use M
58:30 - set so just use M set and then the key
58:34 - and the value
58:34 - for example this time I want to insert
58:39 - some numbers so I will just say num1 and
58:43 - I will just give 50 here and then after
58:47 - a space I will just write num2 and then
58:51 - I will say 60 here num 3 and for example
58:56 - 70 and so on right and then press Enter
58:59 - and I say is okay and then when I say
59:03 - keys keys
59:05 - Astrix it's going to give me name 3 and
59:08 - name - which were already there and then
59:11 - num1 and num2 because here you can see I
59:15 - have given the same key two times right
59:18 - so num1 was there num2 and num2 i have
59:21 - given two times let's see the value
59:24 - inside the num - so num to get num2 and
59:29 - let's see the value inside it so the
59:32 - value inside is is the last set value so
59:35 - whatever is the last set value you will
59:40 - set for this key it will show you that
59:43 - value here right so once again for
59:47 - example I will just give em set I'm set
59:51 - and then num 3 here and then gave the
59:57 - value of for example 60 here and then
60:00 - once again do
60:01 - the key Asterix is going to give me
60:04 - named three named num tree num to name
60:08 - two and one right so right now I have
60:11 - two names and three numbers inside my
60:15 - database now if we want to set the
60:17 - expiry in millisecond there is a command
60:20 - called P set X and then it takes the
60:25 - value in millisecond you can see in the
60:28 - intellisense also right so I'm not going
60:30 - to set any value here but I just wanted
60:34 - to show you this command also exists
60:36 - which will take the value of seconds in
60:40 - milliseconds right so this is P set X
60:44 - okay now there is a one more command
60:47 - which is called Dec R and incr which we
60:54 - use to increment and decrement the value
60:56 - of some key so for example I want to
60:59 - increment the value of key num1 so let's
61:04 - see the value first of all so value of
61:07 - num1 is right now 50 and then we can
61:12 - just write Dec are num1 and then press
61:19 - enter and now the value becomes 49 right
61:23 - it will give you the result and when you
61:25 - give get num 1 is going to give you the
61:29 - value 49 so this Dec our command will
61:33 - decrement the value by 1 and if you do a
61:36 - and see our command to the num 1 for
61:40 - example once again the value will become
61:43 - 50 so I NCR and Dec are is to decrease
61:48 - and increase the value by 1 okay let me
61:51 - clear this terminal once again now there
61:54 - is one more command to increment or
61:58 - decrement the value by some number and
62:01 - this is for example I NC R by so incr by
62:08 - and the key name for example num1 once
62:12 - again and i want to increment the
62:15 - value of num1 pi5 so earlier it was
62:18 - fifty right and then it's going to
62:21 - become fifty-five because I have
62:23 - incrementing the value by five in the
62:27 - same way I can do Dec are by and on the
62:31 - same number num1 and for example I want
62:34 - to reduce the value by thirty right and
62:37 - then press ENTER and now it becomes
62:40 - twenty five so you get num1 and the
62:45 - result or the value inside it is 25 now
62:48 - the last command I want to show here is
62:51 - the append command so let me just set
62:57 - one more value for example set and then
63:01 - the key name for example I will name it
63:04 - as my key okay and the value here I want
63:09 - to set is hello okay and then press
63:14 - Enter and then get my key it's hello
63:20 - right now there is a append command so I
63:23 - can just use a PP en D append and as the
63:27 - name suggests I can append something to
63:30 - the key right so I want to append to my
63:34 - key so I will just write the key name
63:36 - and whatever string you want to append
63:38 - here so for example in double quotes I
63:41 - will just give a space here and then I
63:45 - will just write world here okay and then
63:47 - press ENTER and you can see the number
63:50 - of characters I think for the new value
63:53 - right so once again get my key and it's
63:58 - going to give me hello world so space
64:01 - world is appended to the my key right so
64:07 - append is used to append a string so
64:10 - these are some of the other command
64:11 - which you can use with the string values
64:14 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
64:16 - register tool for beginners in the last
64:18 - two videos we have talked about string
64:21 - values in Redis now in this video I'm
64:24 - going to show you how you can use hashes
64:26 - as values in right
64:28 - now first of all what are hashes hashes
64:32 - are map between the string fields and
64:35 - string values hence they are perfect
64:38 - datatype for representation of objects
64:41 - in red is every hash can store up to
64:44 - four billion field value pairs now you
64:49 - may ask that I have talked about key
64:52 - value pairs but what are these field
64:55 - value pairs right so let me show you a
64:59 - slide and then you will be able to
65:01 - understand in a better way so this was
65:04 - the slide similar kind of slide I have
65:06 - shown you in the string data type also
65:09 - right so in the hashes we are talking
65:12 - about hashes now so in the case of
65:15 - hashes the keys are same which are
65:18 - printable ASCII you can see here but in
65:21 - the case of string we were using string
65:24 - array here right and that string array
65:27 - was about 512 megabyte right now in the
65:32 - case of hashes we use this kind of map
65:37 - of field value right so field is this
65:41 - one and value is this one okay in the
65:45 - cases of string it was like a like only
65:48 - a string value right so I will give you
65:52 - an example for example I want to store
65:54 - students database or students in for
66:00 - data then what I can do here is I can
66:04 - say student 1 as a key so student 1 as a
66:08 - key and then for example student has
66:11 - what attribute student has for example
66:14 - name surname age in which class he is so
66:19 - here field can be name and then for
66:23 - example name is equal to mark value 1
66:26 - can be mark right age is the field 2 for
66:30 - example in this case and then for
66:33 - example 15 is the value 2 here right so
66:37 - name can be field 3 here and then
66:40 - whatever the surname of the
66:42 - and it will be value three right so for
66:46 - every student we can just provide this
66:50 - kind of map for his information so this
66:55 - is how hash data type as well you walk
66:58 - in Redis right now let's take a
67:02 - practical example and then we will be
67:04 - able to understand this concept so I'm
67:08 - going to just start the Redis CLI and
67:11 - let me see what are the keys there so
67:14 - I'm going to just write keys pattern and
67:16 - these are all the keys so I'm going to
67:18 - flush all so let me flush all here so
67:23 - all the keys will be deleted and now I'm
67:26 - going to clear this CLI and let's start
67:30 - with the hashes right so as we have seen
67:35 - in the case of strings we can just use
67:39 - this set command to set a key value pair
67:42 - now in the case of hashes we can use H I
67:47 - am set to set a key field value pair
67:53 - right so for example we were talking
67:55 - about student information database right
67:59 - so just write H M set H stands for
68:03 - hashes here I am set we have already
68:05 - seen in the case of strings also right
68:07 - so just write H am set and then for
68:11 - example s tu1 for student 1 and then for
68:15 - example I will just write name is equal
68:18 - to max' right and then I can also give
68:23 - the second field value pair right so for
68:27 - example his age is equal to 15 and then
68:30 - for example class in which class he is
68:33 - so he isn't for example 8th class okay
68:39 - this is just an example so this is
68:42 - student 1 information let me just give
68:45 - this minus here so we will be able to
68:48 - understand properly and then when I
68:50 - press ENTER it's going to say ok and to
68:54 - get this
68:55 - value there are two ways of getting so
68:59 - you can just say H get and the key name
69:03 - for example s T u minus one is the key
69:07 - name and you can give the field name
69:10 - whatever field you want to get or you
69:13 - can just say get a key name and here get
69:17 - we have already seen in the case of
69:19 - strings also and you just need to add H
69:23 - before it and then the student key name
69:26 - I say is error because we just need to
69:30 - give the field name also so what field
69:32 - there we want to get so we want to get
69:35 - for example name of student 1 it says
69:39 - max here right now if you want to get
69:42 - all the information about student 1 you
69:46 - can just say H get all ok and here you
69:51 - can just give the student one key name
69:54 - and it's going to give you all the you
69:58 - know field value information about the
70:01 - student 1 so for example name max age 15
70:05 - plus 8
70:06 - okay so let's add one more student for
70:10 - example so once again this command
70:13 - it's hm set student 2 and then the name
70:18 - for example Tom age is 12 for example
70:25 - and class is 7 okay press enter and once
70:30 - again you can get the information about
70:32 - the student to using s tu minus 2 right
70:36 - so let me clear the terminal so in this
70:39 - way you can just set the hash value and
70:45 - get the hash value right now there is
70:49 - one more command for for example H
70:53 - exists and this will tell you if the
70:57 - field inside this hash cells exists or
71:01 - not
71:01 - so just write H exists and then the key
71:06 - name for example s tu minus 1
71:09 - and then for example I am searching for
71:13 - surname okay
71:16 - and surname field does not exist in
71:19 - student 1 info right and then I press
71:22 - ENTER and it says integers zero so there
71:27 - is no information about the surname of
71:30 - student 1 right in the case of name this
71:35 - name exists right the name field exist
71:38 - in this student 1 hash set so when I
71:43 - just give this value then it says
71:46 - integer 1 that means it exists so 0 it
71:50 - doesn't exist 1 it exists right now for
71:55 - example I want to delete a value what I
71:58 - can do I can just say H de L and it says
72:04 - first of all I need to give the key name
72:07 - so s tu 1 and I want to delete for
72:10 - example class from it so I'll just write
72:14 - class and then I can just press Enter
72:19 - right and then I can just do H get all
72:23 - and the student 1 key and now you can
72:28 - see class doesn't exist here anymore
72:31 - right for example I want to set once
72:35 - again the same value I can just write H
72:38 - am set and then the same student s tu 1
72:45 - and then plus 8 ok and then press Enter
72:50 - it says ok and once again H get all
72:53 - student 1 and now once again the class
72:56 - is added here ok so you can add and
73:00 - delete the values from this hash like
73:05 - this so for deleting you use H del and
73:09 - then once again for setting you just add
73:11 - this field value pair now there is one
73:15 - more command called at set and X so H
73:20 - set and X so this
73:23 - this command is used for setting the
73:28 - field value if the field doesn't exist
73:31 - so if the field doesn't exist this
73:33 - command will be successful and if the
73:35 - field exists this command will not be
73:38 - successful so for example I will just
73:40 - say st 1 name so name field already
73:44 - exists right and i will just give some
73:47 - other name to the student 1 right and it
73:51 - says 0 so this command is not successful
73:55 - because this command will be successful
73:58 - only in the case of the field not
74:01 - available right so if I do the same
74:04 - command and I know that surname is not
74:07 - there so I will just write surname and
74:09 - some surname and then press ENTER and
74:14 - returns integer 1 that means it has
74:18 - created this field value inside this
74:21 - student set right so once again when I
74:25 - do get all st 1 now this student 1 also
74:31 - have surname information now as in the
74:33 - case of string we were using keys right
74:37 - so we were writing keys Asterix right
74:41 - same you can use for example H keys here
74:46 - and then the key name for example
74:50 - whatever key you want to give here as 2
74:53 - u 1 and it gives all the fields in that
74:59 - hash so by field I mean the name and for
75:04 - example age class and surname only the
75:06 - field not the value of those fields so
75:09 - it will only return the fields of that
75:13 - key whatever we provide here now as in
75:16 - the case of string values we were having
75:20 - Dec are decrement or incr for
75:24 - incrementing the value so the same is
75:27 - available in the case of hashes also so
75:32 - for example I want to increase
75:35 - the age of some student by some number I
75:38 - can do that so just write H and then I n
75:42 - CR by and then the key name s T u minus
75:49 - 1 for example and the field name is age
75:52 - I want to increment his age and then
75:54 - right now the age is 15 for example and
75:58 - I want to increase the age by 2 and then
76:01 - press ENTER and then once again when I
76:04 - do H get all s t1
76:08 - now you can see the age becomes 17 right
76:11 - so in order to increment the value you
76:16 - just write H incr by and the key and the
76:20 - field which you want to increment now if
76:23 - you want to know all the values of a
76:25 - particular key then we can just write H
76:29 - Wells and then the key name as to u1 it
76:34 - will just give you the values of that
76:38 - field value pair right so right now it's
76:42 - not giving name or age or class or
76:45 - surname it's only giving the values of
76:47 - them which is max and then 17 8 and the
76:51 - surname value right so H mel's
76:54 - is for value okay now if you want to
76:58 - know the length of some hash for example
77:02 - I will just give this command @l e n and
77:07 - then the s tu 1 the key name minus 1 it
77:11 - will return you the number of fields in
77:14 - that hash okay so press ENTER and it
77:18 - returns for so I know that student 1 key
77:22 - has numb for number of field name age
77:26 - class and surname so I can just verify
77:30 - that with that okay so for field so it
77:33 - will return number 4 now the last
77:36 - command I want to show here is H M get
77:39 - so let me clear the terminal and then I
77:42 - just want to write H and get and it will
77:46 - give you the result
77:49 - whatever fields you want so for example
77:51 - for st one st one for example i just
77:56 - want to know the name of that student ID
77:59 - i don't want any other information about
78:02 - that in student but only the name then
78:05 - it will give me the name right and for
78:08 - example i just want to know the name and
78:10 - age even though the student hash
78:13 - contains surname and class also but i
78:16 - just want to know the name and age it
78:18 - will just give me the name and age when
78:21 - I use HM gate than the key name and the
78:25 - field name I want to see so the field
78:27 - name I want to see right now is name an
78:29 - age so I just give name and age it'll
78:32 - give me the result of those field only
78:35 - so in this way you can use hashes in
78:37 - ready hey guys welcome to the next video
78:40 - on register tool for beginners in this
78:42 - video we will learn how to use Redis
78:44 - lists so first of all what are red is
78:48 - lists so Redis lists are simply lists of
78:52 - strings sorted by their insertion order
78:56 - right so as I already said that a Redis
79:01 - list is simply as list of string which
79:04 - are sorted by their insert and order so
79:06 - our list would have head on the top and
79:10 - tail on the bottom right now in this
79:14 - list we can insert any element from the
79:17 - top also and from the bottom also right
79:21 - so element can be inserted to a list
79:24 - from the top or from the bottom now
79:28 - sometimes you see lists in a horizontal
79:32 - way right not in a vertical way but on a
79:36 - horizontal way right now if you see a
79:39 - list in a horizontal way your head will
79:43 - be on the left hand side right so your
79:47 - head will be on the left hand side and
79:49 - your tail will be on the right hand side
79:52 - right so Radice have some command for
79:57 - example ll push L push means the left
80:01 - port
80:02 - that means we want to push an element
80:05 - from the head right left and had our
80:09 - same in the case of lists so this is how
80:14 - red is less work it's simply a list with
80:18 - the insertion order now let's see how we
80:22 - can use lists in Redis so I'm going to
80:25 - start a terminal I have already started
80:27 - my Redis server so I'm going to just
80:30 - start the Redis CLI here and then press
80:34 - ENTER and I want to show you one more
80:37 - Redis command which is a ready CLI
80:40 - command and I thought this would be
80:42 - interesting to you so I'm going to open
80:45 - a next terminal and here also I will
80:49 - just give a Redis CLI command and I will
80:52 - give an argument here so I will just
80:55 - give monitor command yeah okay so
80:58 - monitor so ready CLI monitor and what
81:02 - this monitor is going to do is it's
81:04 - going to monitor all the commands which
81:06 - you are executing from your CLI so for
81:10 - example let me give keys Astrix come on
81:15 - here right and now you can see it's
81:18 - showing us that we have given this
81:23 - command keys Asterix at this time this
81:26 - is a timestamp at which this command is
81:30 - given okay so this is the timestamp at
81:33 - which this command is given and this is
81:35 - the command which we have given right so
81:38 - let's do flush all here and then press
81:43 - enter and you can see this flush all
81:47 - command is printed here so this is kind
81:50 - of a monitor right so this is going to
81:53 - monitor what are the command you are
81:56 - giving to your Redis so okay so let's
82:01 - start with the Redis lists so first of
82:06 - all how we can create our Redis list so
82:10 - you can create a Redis list by just
82:13 - giving this command you just need to
82:16 - I'll push right so al push means left
82:21 - push that means we want to insert an
82:24 - element from the top right from the head
82:27 - okay and then we just need to give any
82:30 - key here for example key here I'm going
82:34 - to give num for numbers right and the
82:37 - first key I want to insert here will be
82:40 - for example 1 okay so first number right
82:45 - you can even insert multiple values here
82:49 - for this key for this list for example 2
82:52 - 3 & 4 ok and then press Enter and these
82:57 - four elements are inserted to the list
83:01 - in this order right now to see all the
83:06 - values in the list you use L range
83:10 - commands so just use L range and then
83:15 - the name of the key for example number
83:17 - in our case and then you give the you
83:20 - know start and stop value for the range
83:23 - now already slist index start from zero
83:26 - so for example starting value we can
83:28 - give zero here and let's say we want to
83:31 - just see the values in the list from
83:35 - zero to ten ok and then press Enter it
83:38 - shows us these values from four three
83:43 - two and one
83:45 - right so because we were pushing the
83:48 - values from the top we have pushed one
83:52 - first right so it will be pushed from
83:56 - the top one and then we have pushed two
83:59 - so the top value will become two now
84:02 - when we push two here and that's why
84:05 - it's a reverse order of numbers right so
84:09 - first we have pushed one and then we
84:12 - have pushed two at the top and then we
84:15 - have pushed three at the top and at the
84:17 - last we have pushed for at the top so
84:19 - that's why the number four is at the top
84:22 - of the list and number one is at the
84:24 - bottom of the list right now if we want
84:28 - to push
84:30 - number five on the top we can just do L
84:33 - push here so just do L push and the key
84:38 - name and then for example I will do
84:40 - number five here right and then press
84:43 - ENTER and once again I will do L range
84:45 - you can see five is at the top now if
84:48 - you want to remove the value from the
84:50 - top you give the L pop come on okay
84:55 - so L pop command is going to remove the
84:58 - value from the left hand side left hand
85:01 - side means from the top okay so L PAP
85:04 - pop is going to pop the value from the
85:06 - top and in this case our key is numb and
85:09 - you can see it has popped five from the
85:13 - top that means our list is now up to
85:16 - four okay so let's give the same command
85:18 - and range zero to ten and now our list
85:21 - is one two three four because we have
85:23 - removed five from the top okay let me
85:27 - clear the terminal and then I'm going to
85:31 - show you one more command so let's start
85:34 - with the L range so we have right now
85:36 - four elements in the list now there is a
85:40 - our push command and our pop command
85:44 - also okay so when you do our push that
85:48 - means right push that means from the
85:51 - bottom you are pushing some numbers
85:53 - right so from the bottom for example I
85:56 - want to push the value v Heer okay first
86:00 - of all and just need to give the key a
86:02 - name and then from the bottom I want to
86:04 - push the number five and then press
86:07 - Enter and I will do L range one those
86:09 - again you can see this value goes at the
86:14 - bottom five goes at the bottom because
86:15 - we have our push we have used this
86:18 - command our push our push means from the
86:21 - bottom push from the bottom right from
86:24 - the right hand side of the list
86:27 - okay that's why this five goes at the
86:30 - bottom okay once again let's do this our
86:34 - push and let's push six at the bottom
86:37 - and once again do L range I give you and
86:41 - you can see in the list you have
86:43 - the six at the bottom so in Redis this
86:46 - list is sorted by the insertion order
86:50 - right
86:50 - if you push from the right it will go at
86:53 - the bottom and if you push from the left
86:56 - it will go at the top and four left push
87:00 - you use L push and four right push you
87:03 - use our push now as we have seen in the
87:06 - case of L pop L pop is going to pop the
87:09 - value from the top our pop is going to
87:12 - pop the value from the bottom so just
87:15 - came our pop here and then the key name
87:19 - and it's going to pop six from the list
87:22 - which is from the bottom right let's do
87:25 - L range command once again and now you
87:27 - can see a six is gone from the list in a
87:30 - same way less two are pop once again and
87:33 - now five is gone from the list so once
87:37 - again let's do L range and now we have a
87:41 - list of four numbers right let me clear
87:44 - the terminal here now let's give L range
87:47 - command once again and now there is a
87:49 - command called L Len okay
87:52 - this means left length and name of the
87:56 - key for example it's going to give you
87:58 - the length of the list in our case this
88:02 - length is equal to the number of element
88:04 - in the list
88:06 - okay so L Len is for knowing the length
88:09 - of the list now for example if you want
88:12 - to get some value at some index you just
88:15 - do L index command okay and then the
88:19 - name of the key and the index so index
88:23 - start from zero so zero one two three
88:27 - okay so for example we want to get
88:30 - number two here at index 3 so we will
88:34 - just say index three okay and it's going
88:38 - to give you the number one because index
88:41 - starts from zero so zero one two and
88:44 - three so index 3 is the value 1 here
88:47 - okay let's do index zero here and it's
88:51 - going to give us the value 4 now there
88:53 - is one more command called L set so you
88:56 - can use as
88:57 - set and the key name and then you can
89:00 - give the index at which you want to
89:03 - insert a value right so for example I
89:06 - want to insert the value at the very top
89:09 - so the very top is the index zero right
89:13 - and then the value itself so I want to
89:16 - insert the value at the 0th index and
89:19 - the value is five and then when I just
89:22 - press ENTER it says okay and when I do L
89:25 - range you can see at the top at the 0th
89:30 - index this value 4 is replaced by value
89:35 - 5 right so the size of the list remains
89:39 - the same but the value is replaced at
89:42 - the residual 0th index and now the new
89:45 - value is 5 here now let me push some
89:48 - more values here so I'll push you can do
89:51 - are push also wherever you want so L
89:55 - push num and for example I want to push
89:59 - number 6 here and then number 7 and
90:02 - number 8 here ok and let's do L range
90:06 - and you can see all the values are here
90:10 - right now sometimes you don't know the
90:14 - range or the length of your list so for
90:18 - example you just to 0 to 3 here it's
90:22 - going to just give you 0 to 3 values
90:25 - right now if you don't know the length
90:28 - of your list you can give L range and
90:32 - then 0 to minus 1 so let's give this
90:36 - command and you can see it gives all the
90:39 - elements in the list so when you do L
90:42 - range the key name 0 to minus 1 is going
90:46 - to give you all the element in the list
90:49 - right this was giving the values from 0
90:53 - to 10th index so if our list is of
90:56 - length 20 this is going to give you only
91:00 - 10 values 0 to 10 right but this is
91:03 - going to give you all the 20 values if
91:05 - you your list length is 20 now let me
91:09 - clear
91:10 - this terminal and let's go to the next
91:14 - command so now the next command is El
91:17 - push X and that means l.push if the key
91:22 - exists okay so the left push if the key
91:26 - exists so we know that we have created a
91:29 - list with the key num right so let's do
91:34 - first of all this el range right and
91:36 - then we will give this el push X okay
91:42 - and this means that insert to this list
91:46 - for example this key exists already so
91:51 - insert to the list if this key already
91:53 - exists which you are providing here okay
91:56 - and this is the left push so we want to
91:59 - push one more value to the top so let's
92:03 - push nine at the top and because this
92:06 - key num exists this command is
92:09 - successful right so let's do el range
92:11 - once again and this key is inserted at
92:15 - the top let's say we do ll push X for a
92:20 - key which doesn't exist for example
92:22 - let's say we have a key for subjects so
92:27 - let's say the key is sub here and we
92:31 - want to push some keys for example once
92:35 - again 1 2 3 4 5 ok but this key doesn't
92:40 - exist right and then when we press ENTER
92:43 - it returns zero because this command is
92:47 - not successful because this command
92:50 - checks whether this key exists or not
92:53 - and if this key exists then it's it's
92:57 - pushing these values on the top right
93:00 - but because this key doesn't exist
93:04 - this command fails and there is no list
93:07 - will be created now the next command I
93:10 - want to show here is L insert before or
93:13 - after so you just do L insert here and
93:18 - then the key name for example num here
93:21 - and you have the option
93:23 - before or after so before after are the
93:26 - keyword for example I use the keyword
93:29 - before here so I'm going to just write
93:31 - before and the pivot name pivot name is
93:37 - this element okay so I want to insert
93:42 - the value before two for example
93:45 - okay so let me write to here and the
93:50 - value is this time for example 55
93:55 - okay so I'll insert the key name and you
94:00 - can use this keyword before or after
94:02 - here and then the pivot and then the
94:05 - value once again I do press ENTER and
94:09 - you can see now the less size is 9 and
94:12 - when I do I'll range 0 to minus 1 you
94:17 - can see this 55 is inserted before -
94:22 - right before 2 is the index from the
94:26 - left right because we have done the L
94:29 - insert okay so before 2 is inserted 55
94:34 - right you can do after also so for
94:37 - example I want to insert after 3 okay
94:43 - I'll let insert after four so after five
94:48 - we want to insert the value 4 you can
94:51 - see after 5 there is 3 right so after 5
94:56 - there is a value 3 and we want to insert
94:59 - 4 value 4 here and now our list is of
95:03 - size 10 and you can see now after 5
95:07 - comes for okay and above 3 comes for
95:12 - okay so this L insert is used to insert
95:16 - the value before or after some value so
95:21 - these are some of the frequently used
95:22 - command with radius list hey guys
95:25 - welcome to the next video and registered
95:26 - role for beginners and in this video we
95:28 - will learn what are sets and how to use
95:30 - sets in Redis so first of all what are
95:35 - sets
95:36 - so ready sets are an unordered
95:40 - collection of unique strings right so by
95:44 - unique I mean whatever values set
95:48 - contains they are all unique so no
95:51 - repetition is allowed here okay
95:54 - and they are unordered you know lists so
95:58 - they are not ordered and they are unique
96:01 - so let's see how we can use sets in
96:06 - practice so I have already started my
96:09 - already server and on my CLI first of
96:13 - all let me just clear all the keys which
96:17 - I already have so I will just say keys
96:20 - and I have only one key which I'm going
96:24 - to flush all and now let's create a set
96:30 - okay so to create a set you can just use
96:34 - s for set and then add okay so s add and
96:39 - then give any a name any name to a key
96:43 - so for example my set is a key here and
96:46 - then you can add members here one or
96:50 - many okay so for example I want to have
96:53 - a set of numbers so let me say this is
96:56 - my first set so I will name it set one
96:59 - my set one and let's say I add here 1 2
97:04 - 3 4 for example ok and I just press
97:09 - Enter which is going to create a set and
97:11 - add these four numbers now here I have
97:16 - provided four different numbers right so
97:19 - they are all unique and to view the
97:23 - members of a set you just to s members
97:27 - ok so s members and the key named Mikey
97:31 - name is my set 1 and you can view all
97:34 - the members of the set right now for
97:37 - example in this set I want to add one
97:39 - more value so I just say s add and then
97:44 - my set 1 and I want to add 3 here right
97:49 - and I already know the
97:50 - here I already have three in my set and
97:53 - I want to you know add one more tree to
97:58 - the set which is not allowed right so
98:01 - it's going to give me zero in return
98:03 - that means this 3 is not added to the
98:06 - set because 3 is already there okay we
98:10 - can just prove with this by using s
98:12 - members and then the set name so you can
98:16 - see set is not changed the values in the
98:19 - set remains same because they must be
98:22 - unique okay on the other hand when I do
98:24 - as set 1 5 which is a new member in the
98:28 - set I can just verify this so you can
98:32 - see this time it's added and you can
98:35 - verify it with this value if you get one
98:38 - here that means the number is added to
98:41 - the set and if you get 0 here that means
98:43 - number is not added to the set right now
98:47 - for example if I want to know how many
98:52 - values are there in the set so how many
98:55 - members are there in the set so I can
98:57 - just do s card and then the name of the
99:02 - set my set 1 ok my set 1 and I can see
99:08 - there are 5 members in the set
99:10 - ok now let me create one more set
99:15 - so I have my set 1 let me clear the
99:18 - terminal first and now I will create set
99:22 - - so set add or s add my side to here ok
99:28 - and let me add some more numbers here
99:32 - this time I will add for example 5 8 7 6
99:38 - 4 and 9 in this set ok and then press
99:42 - enter and I can view this set by s
99:46 - members here and the key name has said -
99:50 - and you can see these are the member of
99:52 - second set right now if you have
99:54 - multiple sets you can subtract one set
99:57 - from other using s diff ok so you can
100:01 - use as
100:02 - Dave and this active command returns and
100:06 - members of the set resulting from the
100:10 - difference between the first set and all
100:12 - other successive sets so this is the
100:14 - difference so I will just add my set one
100:19 - as my first set and then I will just
100:23 - give the second set as my set to ok and
100:28 - then press ENTER and it's going to give
100:31 - me the difference between these two set
100:33 - let me show you the values of the set 1
100:37 - also so we can verify so you can see in
100:41 - the set 1 we have value 1 to 5 and then
100:44 - in the set to we have values 4 5 6 7 8 9
100:50 - so from s diff it's going to give you
100:52 - the values which are there in the set 1
100:56 - but they are not there in the set - okay
101:00 - so these values these 3 values are not
101:04 - there in the set - right but 4 & 5 are
101:07 - there in the set - so they are discarded
101:11 - so as diff is going to give you the
101:14 - difference that means whatever values
101:17 - are there in set 1 and not there in set
101:21 - 2 now if you want to know the S diff and
101:25 - save it into the third set for example
101:29 - then you can do that also so you can
101:31 - just write as diff and then store and
101:34 - then the destination so I'm going to
101:36 - save the difference in a new set so for
101:39 - example my set 3 right and then the
101:44 - difference between these 2 sets so my
101:47 - set 1 and my set 2 so these 3 values
101:51 - will be saved in the new set which is my
101:55 - set 3 ok press Enter and then you can
101:58 - see by s members my set 3 you can see
102:03 - all these values are saved in this set 3
102:07 - which is the difference between my set 1
102:09 - and my set - now you can do the union
102:13 - also union of the set so for
102:16 - example I want to do Union I can just
102:19 - write s Union and the set name so my set
102:25 - 1 and my set
102:28 - - ok so I wanted to do the union of set
102:31 - 1 and set 2 and then press ENTER and
102:34 - it's going to give you these values so
102:38 - Union means whatever values which are
102:42 - there in the first set also and second
102:44 - set also the combination of that unique
102:48 - value right so all the unique value
102:51 - which are there in the first set and
102:53 - second set so these value were in the
102:58 - first set and these value which are
103:01 - unique in the second set so this is the
103:05 - combination of s Union ok and same you
103:09 - can do for storing so you can just write
103:11 - s Union store here so just write s Union
103:16 - store and I'm going to store it in set
103:19 - for for example so my set for the union
103:23 - of set 1 and set to right press enter
103:27 - and union is saved I can do s member my
103:31 - set for and you can see now it has one
103:35 - two nine which is the union of set one
103:37 - and set to okay so in order to store use
103:40 - s Union store now if I want to remove
103:43 - some members from a set I can do s RAM
103:47 - for removing a value from a set or
103:51 - member from a set and for example I want
103:53 - to remove some member from set for and I
103:59 - want to remove for example nine okay and
104:02 - then press Enter it's going to remove
104:04 - nine from the set for and I can do s
104:07 - members one that once again and you can
104:09 - see nine is not there anymore okay you
104:12 - can remove multiple values for example
104:15 - eight seven six and so on and these will
104:20 - be removed so now I have only up to five
104:23 - values because eight seven six are
104:26 - removed now for example I want to remove
104:28 - a random value from
104:30 - the set so I don't want to remove a
104:33 - specific value but I want to remove as
104:36 - random value so for example I can do s
104:38 - pop here to remove a random value from a
104:43 - set so my set for for example and for
104:47 - example I want to remove only one value
104:50 - from here right so I can just press
104:53 - Enter
104:54 - it says three so it has removed three
104:57 - from this set okay so let's do s member
105:02 - s 4 and you can see 3 is no more there
105:07 - in the set for okay so it has picked a
105:10 - random value from this set and removed
105:13 - it okay I can give for example as pop my
105:18 - set for I for example I want to remove
105:20 - two random values so I can just do that
105:24 - and now it has removed four and one from
105:29 - the set and now my set is only of two
105:33 - values or two members two and five okay
105:36 - so as pop is to remove the random value
105:39 - from the set now let me clear this
105:43 - terminal and let me just print the
105:46 - values of set one and set to once again
105:49 - so set one has one two five and said to
105:52 - have four to nine now there is a command
105:55 - called as inter and as inter command
105:58 - gets the element of a set after the
106:01 - intersection of all the specified set
106:04 - okay so it's going to give you the
106:06 - intersection of all the specified set so
106:10 - just to s inter for example my set 1 and
106:16 - my set 2 and then press ENTER and it's
106:20 - going to give you the intersection
106:22 - intersection means these values are
106:25 - there in both the sets so these are the
106:28 - intersection of both the sets so 4 & 5
106:32 - are there in set 1 and set 2 so it's
106:36 - going to give you those value only and
106:38 - as we have seen in the case of as deaf
106:41 - and as
106:42 - Union you can do for example as interst
106:47 - store so you can store the intersection
106:50 - into a new set so as inter store and for
106:54 - example I want to save this in set five
106:57 - and then press ENTER and then I can just
107:00 - see the content of set 5 which is 4 & 5
107:04 - which is correct now the last command I
107:06 - want to show here is s move command so
107:09 - as move and this command is used to you
107:14 - know transfer or move value or member
107:17 - from one set to the another set right so
107:21 - for example I want to move one from my
107:25 - set one to my set - okay so I want to
107:29 - move this value to the set - so what I
107:33 - can do so first of all the source source
107:35 - is my set one and I want to move it to
107:40 - the destination which is my set - and I
107:44 - want to transfer the value one member
107:47 - one right so press Enter
107:49 - it says 1 that means the operation is
107:52 - successful so let me see the s member or
107:56 - members of set - and now you can see one
108:01 - is moved to the set - earlier one was
108:06 - not there in the set - but now we have
108:09 - one in the set - and let's see the
108:13 - contents of set one also so you can see
108:17 - one is no longer there in set one
108:20 - because it's moved from set one to set
108:23 - two so these are some of the most
108:25 - frequently used command in Redis sets
108:29 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
108:31 - register twirl for beginners and in this
108:34 - video we will learn how we can use
108:36 - sorted sets in Redis so first of all
108:39 - what are sorted sets so ready sorted
108:43 - sets are similar to the Redis sets with
108:46 - a unique feature that their members can
108:49 - be sorted now every member of a sorted
108:54 - set is associated
108:56 - with a score and based on the score
108:59 - their members can be sorted right so you
109:03 - can see in this diagram the raddest key
109:06 - will remain the same as other patterns
109:10 - but here you can see a score here so you
109:15 - can define a score for example I will
109:17 - define a score 100 and then the value
109:21 - associated with the score so the value
109:23 - associated with the score is well you -
109:26 - and this is our member of a set and
109:29 - there is a new feature in the sorted set
109:32 - which is this score right so you can
109:35 - define a score and with this score you
109:39 - can define a member or a value
109:41 - associated with it and then on the basis
109:45 - of that we can sort the members of our
109:48 - set right so let's see in practical how
109:52 - it works so I'm going to open my Redis
109:56 - CLI so the first command we are going to
109:58 - learn here is that ad and the said ad is
110:02 - used to create a set if it doesn't exist
110:06 - or add a member to this set if it
110:10 - already exists right so every command in
110:15 - sorted set will start with this
110:17 - character Z and then whatever its
110:20 - function is the function name for
110:23 - example right so that ad and then the
110:26 - key name for example my set 1 and the
110:29 - score so score is 1 and the value
110:32 - associated with it
110:34 - so squarely for example you want to
110:36 - associate it with the score one is a
110:39 - write in a similar way we can define
110:42 - multiple score members here so score and
110:45 - the value associated whether 2 and B for
110:48 - example 3 is the third score and the
110:51 - value we want to associate with it C and
110:54 - then they need not be in order so score
110:58 - can be 5 now and the value can be D here
111:02 - right or any other value right and then
111:05 - press enter and you can see for
111:09 - bows are inserted in the sortedset now
111:13 - to get the members of a sorted set you
111:18 - use Z and then range command okay as we
111:22 - have seen in the sets also and then what
111:26 - is your key name for example my set 1
111:29 - and then starting value and end value as
111:33 - we have seen in the case of sets also so
111:36 - in the case of sets we have seen that 0
111:39 - and minus 1 are going to give all the
111:42 - values in the set right so press ENTER
111:45 - and you can see here all the values are
111:49 - printed here now you can see here the
111:53 - values are printed not the you know
111:56 - schools associated with them
111:59 - right so for example I once again write
112:02 - Z add and then set 1 my set 1 and then
112:08 - for example I can just give score 100
112:10 - here and then the value is here right
112:14 - and then press Enter and once again I
112:17 - will just give that range my set 1 and
112:20 - then you can see all the values here or
112:24 - all the members here but these are not
112:26 - the school's these are just order
112:30 - ordered number now if you want to know
112:33 - how many number of members are there in
112:36 - our set we can use Z card here ok and
112:40 - the key name for example my set 1 and
112:43 - then press Enter and I can see that
112:46 - there are 5 members in my sorted set
112:49 - right now in order to get the count of
112:52 - members in the sorted set with the
112:54 - scores within the given range we use
112:58 - said count okay and then the key name so
113:02 - my set 1 and the minimum and the maximum
113:07 - score value here so for example I want
113:10 - to get 1 2 3 here ok and then press
113:15 - Enter and then it's going to count the
113:17 - number of values between this range
113:20 - right so for example
113:23 - just write 1 2 5 here and values are 4
113:27 - because in between school 1 and school 5
113:31 - there are 4 values including those
113:34 - scores now I can just write 1 250 here
113:38 - or 55 and still it's going to give us 4
113:42 - values number of values because the last
113:44 - score we have associated here is hundred
113:47 - so when we write here 1 0 1 here and
113:51 - then press ENTER then only it's going to
113:54 - give us 5 values and let's see we can
113:58 - give 99 here still it gives the 4 value
114:03 - so the z count is going to take the
114:06 - score values and then depending upon the
114:09 - score values is going to give you the
114:11 - number of values in between these scores
114:15 - now let me clear the terminal and to
114:20 - remove any member from a set you use Z
114:25 - REM and then the key name my set and
114:30 - member so the member here will be the
114:34 - member value so not the score but the
114:37 - member so for example I want to remove
114:40 - the member B so I can just give the
114:43 - value of member of B and then press
114:46 - ENTER and once again I will just give
114:49 - this sled range command and now it's
114:52 - giving the same answer because I haven't
114:55 - given the right key name so I must give
114:59 - that a my set 1 here right and then it
115:03 - gives integer 1 that means the command
115:06 - is successful and once again the range
115:08 - and now you can see the value is removed
115:11 - from here now if you want to determine
115:13 - the index of a member in a sorted set
115:16 - you use that rank here so just give rows
115:20 - that rank amount and then my set 1 and
115:22 - the member name so for example d here
115:26 - and then press ENTER and it's going to
115:29 - give you the index of this D right so
115:35 - the index starts from 0
115:36 - so 0 1 2 right for example I want to see
115:41 - the index of e here I was going to give
115:44 - me the index 3 and for example for
115:47 - member a the index is 0 now there is a Z
115:50 - Reb rank command also so you can just
115:54 - write Z Rev rank here and this is the
116:00 - reverse rank right so the rank will be
116:04 - sorted according to the score so highest
116:06 - score is the 0th index right and then
116:10 - the lowest score is the maximum index
116:15 - okay so for example my set 1 and then
116:19 - the member name for example e is the
116:22 - rank 0 here right because index of e is
116:26 - the highest rank rank is 100 for e right
116:32 - and it's the biggest rank that means the
116:35 - index for it will be 0 because we are
116:39 - printing the reverse rank here ok for
116:42 - example you want to see the index of a
116:45 - it will be 3 because it's in reverse
116:48 - order now the last command I'm going to
116:50 - show you here is z-score command ok and
116:55 - then I can give the key name and the
116:58 - member name so for example I will give
117:01 - the member a and then press Enter it's
117:04 - going to give me the score value of this
117:08 - member right so for example I want to
117:10 - see the score of member E and press
117:14 - Enter it's going to give me hundred
117:16 - because score associated with II was
117:19 - hundred right and for example this value
117:22 - doesn't exist in our sorted set for
117:26 - example I just added or given the random
117:29 - value here and then press Enter
117:31 - it's going to return the nil value which
117:34 - doesn't exist okay now let me clear the
117:38 - terminal
117:39 - let me show one more command to you so
117:42 - for example I just want to print the
117:45 - range of my set 1 0 to minus
117:50 - and this is a CDE and I want to add one
117:55 - more value here so I will just add said
117:57 - add and I want to add this value to my
118:00 - set one and at the score one and I want
118:04 - to add for example a a five times and
118:08 - then press ENTER and it and it returns
118:11 - me one that means the value for this
118:14 - score is now set to a a instead of a for
118:19 - example right so let me do set range
118:22 - once again and you can see here the new
118:26 - value is added here which is e right and
118:31 - if you remember the score of a was also
118:37 - one right so let me give the same
118:41 - command now which is z-score and this
118:44 - time I want to just see the score of a
118:48 - which is 1 and then I want to see the
118:52 - score of AAA which is also 1 so it's
118:56 - totally fine if you give a same score to
118:59 - multiple values right so for example I
119:03 - want to give one more value to this
119:07 - score for example BBB B and then press
119:10 - ENTER and once again the range I want to
119:13 - see this value is added and then I want
119:16 - to see you see the score of BBB B so BBB
119:20 - B and you can see the score is still 1
119:24 - okay so it's totally fine to have one
119:29 - score for multiple values now what
119:33 - happens to the rank here so for examples
119:36 - red rank for my set 1 so my set 1 and
119:41 - then BBB B and the index here is 2 so
119:47 - this is how sorted set works now there
119:50 - is one more command which is Z range by
119:54 - score and then you can give the key name
120:00 - and then the score value minimum score
120:03 - for example 1
120:04 - and then the maximum score for example
120:06 - I'm going to give you a two right and
120:09 - then press ENTER and I get here three
120:12 - values because there are three values
120:16 - associated with the score one and I
120:19 - think there was no score for two right
120:22 - so no value was associated with two so
120:26 - let's see one two four for example and
120:30 - now I can see these values and see also
120:34 - so if you want to get values by the
120:37 - range of scores then you can use that
120:40 - range by score okay so this is how you
120:43 - can use sorted sets in Redis there are
120:47 - some more commands which are associated
120:49 - with sorted set you can just search for
120:52 - them and then practice them but these
120:55 - are some of the most frequently used
120:57 - command with the sorted sets hey guys
121:00 - welcome to the next video on register
121:02 - rule for beginners in this video we will
121:05 - learn how to use Redis publish/subscribe
121:08 - so Redis publish/subscribe implements
121:12 - the messaging system where sender is
121:15 - called the publisher and the receiver is
121:20 - called the subscriber right now in Redis
121:25 - a client can subscribe to any number of
121:29 - channels so let me give you an example
121:32 - and let me show you how you can use
121:35 - Redis publish subscribe so you can see I
121:39 - have opened three ready CLI terminals in
121:44 - three different terminals right so this
121:47 - is ready CLI first terminal second
121:49 - terminal and third terminal now first of
121:53 - all I am going to subscribe to a channel
121:56 - so I can just write subscribe here and
122:00 - then it takes a channel name right and I
122:06 - can give any channel name for example
122:09 - Redis or any other channel name so for
122:12 - example my channel
122:14 - and I can subscribe to this channel okay
122:18 - so the name depends upon you right so
122:21 - for example I subscribe to the channel
122:25 - called Redis and I just press ENTER so
122:30 - now this is or this terminal is
122:33 - subscribed to this channel right now
122:38 - from the second CLI when I publish some
122:41 - message to this channel so let me
122:45 - publish something so to publish a
122:48 - message you can just use a keyword
122:50 - publish as we have seen in subscribe so
122:54 - to subscribe you use a keyword subscribe
122:57 - and then a channel name for publishing
123:00 - you use a keyboard publish and the
123:02 - channel name on which you want to
123:04 - publish right so I want to publish on
123:08 - the Redis channel and then your message
123:12 - for example hi right and I press enter
123:16 - and you can see on the subscriber it
123:20 - gets the same message so first of all it
123:23 - will just show you what kind of message
123:28 - is coming so it's a message and then on
123:31 - what channel it's coming and what is the
123:34 - message itself right now if you want to
123:37 - send a big message you can just enclose
123:42 - your message inside these double quotes
123:45 - so for example hello world here and then
123:50 - press enter then it's received here okay
123:54 - now it's possible to subscribe to any
124:00 - number of channels right so you can see
124:03 - I am subscribed to Redis from one
124:07 - channel now I can just copy the same
124:11 - command in the next terminal here and
124:15 - then I'm subscribed to this channel so
124:19 - now there are two subscriber subscribe
124:22 - to one Redis channel so this is the
124:26 - channel
124:27 - and I'm subscribed to that channel right
124:30 - so there are two subscriber for the
124:33 - channel named Redis and when I just send
124:38 - hello world
124:39 - again for example now it is received by
124:43 - both the subscribers right so you can
124:47 - see hello world is received here and
124:50 - hello world is received here okay so
124:54 - this is how publish/subscribe method
124:57 - work in Redis now when you are doing or
125:02 - using Redis in the programming then it's
125:07 - really important or it's really useful
125:10 - so for example recently I created some
125:14 - kind of API where I wanted to listen for
125:18 - any event for save in Redis so whatever
125:23 - is saved whenever some command comes and
125:26 - something is saved in Redis I wanted to
125:29 - subscribe to that save event right and I
125:34 - have used this publish/subscribe method
125:38 - from Redis in that API and it worked
125:42 - fine so it's kind of listening to the
125:45 - trigger for examples for saving the data
125:49 - or some delete deletion of data you can
125:53 - subscribe and then you will get this
125:56 - message on the next side which is
125:59 - subscribing and based on that
126:02 - subscription you can trigger some event
126:05 - okay now let me just close this CLI and
126:10 - once again open the CLI once again and
126:13 - let me clear the terminal once again and
126:16 - there is a command called P subscribe so
126:18 - you can do P subscribe and then it takes
126:21 - the pattern so for example I can just
126:25 - write R and then s tricks are s tricks
126:28 - here means any publisher when it's
126:32 - published on the channel name which
126:35 - start with r it will receive that
126:37 - message so for example
126:40 - I am publishing this publish Redis
126:44 - because this pattern matches this
126:47 - pattern so Asterix is some kind of a
126:50 - wild card here so it's whatever so for
126:54 - example I'm subscribing to RS tricks and
126:56 - I'm just publishing the same message
126:59 - again and you can see it's receiving
127:02 - that message because it's just matching
127:06 - the pattern whatever publisher publishes
127:09 - on the pattern which matches rs tricks
127:14 - for example R and whatever comes after R
127:18 - this is matching that pattern so it will
127:22 - receive that message for example I can
127:26 - just do something like this I publish on
127:29 - R X for example this also matches this
127:34 - pattern right because we just want to
127:37 - match the first letter of that channel
127:42 - and whatever comes after that it will be
127:45 - matched automatically so this is kind of
127:47 - a pattern matching in Redis so P
127:51 - subscribe is used to pattern matching
127:54 - and whatever publisher channel matches
127:59 - that pattern it will be receiving that
128:02 - message so you can see this is receiving
128:05 - that message but this CLI is not
128:08 - receiving so because we have subscribed
128:10 - to a concrete channel layer which is not
128:15 - a pattern so whenever we just give the
128:20 - raddest channel itself then only it will
128:23 - receive the message and this
128:25 - automatically receives the message
128:27 - because here we are just matching the
128:31 - pattern okay so in this way you can use
128:33 - publish subscribe in Redis I hope you
128:36 - have enjoyed this video please recommend
128:37 - subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

so first of all what is Redis so Redis is an opensource BSD licensed advanced inmemory key value store where Keys can contain data structures such as strings hashes lists sets and sorted sets so it's an inmemory key value store with persistence that means radius can be used as a database or a caching layer or a message broker now I already said that its BSD license that means it's open source now Redis is written in C and it's no SQL database now what is no SQL no SQL is an informal loosely defined term for nonrelational structured data storage systems like MongoDB man cached CouchDB or Cassandra so following in the footsteps of other no SQL databases such as Cassandra CouchDB or MongoDB Redis allows the user to store vast amount of data without the limits of relational databases so in no SQL databases data can be stored in non relational way now what does the name Redis mean ready stands for remote directory server it is often referred to as a data structure server since the keys can contain strings hashes lists sets and sorted sets so because the keys can contains these type of different data structures it's often referred as a data structure server right so the name come from remote directory server now what is right is used for so as I already mentioned that it's an advanced key value store that can function as a no SQL database or as a memory cache store to improve performance when serving data that is stored in system memory and also it can be used as a message broker so it can be used in place of cashing systems such as memcached now you must be wondering how to interact with Radice so Redis can be installed on a server and it can be interacted with a commandline tool or commandline interface which is called Redis CLI so using this Redis CLI we can interact with our Redis server now this Redis client can be used on any machine and then when we open this Redis client which is a commandline client the first line will look like this so Redis then this kind of angle bracket this we will see in the coming videos how to install Redis and how we can use Redis now let's talk about some of the history about Redis so in early 2009 our developer called Salvatore Sanfilippo he was an Italian developer by the way started the raddest project at that time he was working on a realtime web analytics solution and found that MySQL could not provide the necessary performance so in June 2009 Redis was deployed in production for a website called log comm which was our realtime web analytics website then in March 2010 a company called VMware hired Sanfilippo to work fulltime on dradis although reddit remains as BSD licensed subsequently vmware hired some of the other developers who also contributed majorly to assist on the project so this was a brief introduction about Redis and from the next video we will see how we can install Redis and how to use Redis so stay tuned and please rate comment subscribe and bye for now hey guys welcome to the next video on register tool for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Redis on your Windows operating system so let's get started so to fall open your favorite browser and search for Redis and hopefully the first result which will appear here will be from Redis dot IO so you need to just click this link which is for the red s dot IO and then once you click this link you will be able to see the Downloads tab on the top of this website so let me just maximize this browser and I can see this tab which is for downloads right so I'm going to click this downloads tab and then I'm in the download section now when you scroll down a little you will see a Windows section here and there is a message here which says the Redis project does not officially support Windows however the Microsoft open tech group develops and maintains this Windows port targeting windows 64 so Redis project does not officially support Windows but there is a group of developers which makes it available for Windows so we just need to click this link which says learn more and when you click this link you will be redirected to a github page of Redis which is maintained by Microsoft Archive so once you reach to this page and scroll a little down and reach to the readme dot MD here on the third line you will be able to see this message which says you can download the latest unsigned binary and unsigned MSI installer from this page so there is a link for the release page right so just click this link which says release page and then you will be redirected to the downloads page for Redis for Windows right now when you scroll down a little here here are few options to download a Redis on your Windows operating system the first option is by using dot MSI file which is our installer second option is by using our zip file so all the binaries will be backed in this zip file and you need to set up the environment variable so I'm going to show you both the ways so let's start with the dot zip file so I'm going to download this dot zip file first of all and I'm going to minimize the browser and here in downloads I can see this zip file so what I will do is I will create a new folder I'm making this folder in my downloads directory itself and I will name it as Redis but you are free to create this directory anywhere wherever you wish right and then I'm going to extract this zip file inside this Redis folder so let me drag this to this Redis folder this zip file and then I'm going to just extract all files inside this Redis folder right so it's going to extract all the files it's not really big file so it will be extracted really soon and you can see all the files are extracted inside this Redis folder and there is a Redis minus X 64 minus 3.2 3.2 is the latest version at the time of making this video so inside this Redis folder there are some files so these files are all are important but to our of our interest one is Redis server and another is ready CLI so let me minimize this other window here and then I'm going to double click on this Redis server Exe file so I'm going to double click on this Redis server which is going to start the Redis server and it will ask you to give the administrative privileges or you need to allow the access to the server so here I'm going to just press this button it says allow access and now the Redis server has been started now the default port on which the Redis server start is this one which is six three seven nine okay so this is the default port on which Redis starts on the localhost and then this is the PID of this Redis server right now next I'm going to start the Redis see Li to interact with this server so now this time click on this red is CLI and it's going to start another terminal and it's going to connect to this Redis server and then using this CLI you will be able to interact with this server right so this is the client and server is running in the background right so let me minimize this window also and let me just place this server here and let me open this client on the right hand side right so this is the server and this is the client now in this client when you write ping you will get the response pong so you can see I'm getting the response pong that means the server is running fine and my client is able to connect to the server and get the response right now in order to save something as a key value pair for testing we can just write set and then it's going to give you some intelligence also so I just wrote a keyword set and it gives me the hint that I need to give the key value pair here so as a key I will give a name or name key + i will give any name as a value so for example mark i mean to give as a name right and then i'm going to press enter and it says okay that means this key value that means name is our key and mark is the value of the name which is the value right so to get the value you can just write get and then the name of the key which is name itself in our case and press ENTER and it's going to give us the value right so that means everything is working fine and we are able to connect to the brightest server and it's able to save the values right but sometimes or most of the times you will not go to this server and start from this directory right so you want to you know open your command line from your windows and you want to connect from this command terminal from windows not from this location right so in order to do that you need to set the environment variables so let's set the environment variables for this Redis client and server so we will be able to open this Redis server and read its client from our windows terminal so in order to do this you just need to rightclick on your this PC so just right click on this PC and then go to the properties and once this properties window is open we will go to the Advanced Settings so just click this option which says advanced system settings and once this advanced system setting is open we are going to go to the environment variables just click this option which says environment variables and once the environment variables is open you just need to select this option under the system variable which is for path so just double click on this option which says path and here we just need to give a new environment variable and this new environment variable is the path to your Redis folder where your server and Redis CL is there so you just need to copy this part where this Redis server executable file is there and ready CLI file is there so I'm just to copy this part and then into this environment variable I will just create a new variable so I will just click new and then I will paste this part right and then press ENTER and then click OK and then once again click OK and then once again click OK right so now the environment variable for Redis so it's set so now I will just close these two terminals right and then I'm going to open the command line so to open my windows terminal I can right click on this windows icon so just right click on the windows icon and then open the command prompt you can open the command prompt from here also or with the admin privileges so I'm going to open the command prompt with the admin privileges and once the command prompt is open I can start the server from this command prompt so to start the server you just need to write Redis server which is the executable file here right so I'm going to just write Redis server and then press Enter which is going to start the Redis server right so because we have set the environment variable now we can start the server from the command prompt from windows from any location right now in order to start the client we will open another command prompt and then we can start this with the Redis CLI command so I'm going to just write Redis CLI and then press Enter and then we are connected to this server right now once again I can set any value here so for example set and then any name or any key I'm going to say this time the key is any number so I'm going to just write number and then any number for example 50 here right and then press ENTER and then I'm going to get numb number and then press ENTER and is going to give us the value of this number which is 50 right so in this way also you can start your ready server and Redis client okay now in case if you are wondering how we can install this Redis on our Windows operating system using this MSI file which is the more easier version we can just download this MSI file and once this MSI file is downloaded I'm going to go to the location where it's downloaded and once this location is open I'm going to install it so I'm going to minimize my browser and I can see that this MSI file is there in my downloads folder so I'm going to double click on this MSI file and once this MSI file installer starts we just need to click some next button to install it so just wait for some seconds to start the wizard and we just need to click Next here and then just accept terms and condition and then click Next and this is the location where Redis will be installed on your system and then this is the important step so it will ask you if you want to add Redis installation folder to your environment variables so this installer will automatically add the Redis path to the environment variable if you check this option which is more easier also right and then click Next and this is the default port as I already said 6 3 7 9 and then it says add an exception to the firewall we can just click Next here and then we will just set the memory as default and click Next and just click install right so it's going to start installing and some seconds Redis will be installed on your system and once it's installed then you will be able to start Redis from your command once again so once again for example I am going to open the command prompt and then I will give the Redis CLI command so I'm going to just write Redis CLI and it's automatically has been started and when I just write ping I will get the response pong so you may be wondering that this time I haven't started the Redis server so if you use the Redis installer MSI file to install Redis the server will be automatically started and you don't need to explicitly start the server you just need to connect to the server using the Redis CLI so you just need to open the command prompt and then using Redis CLI you can connect to that server which is already been started by that installer automatically right so this time we don't need to start the server it's already has been started we just need the ready CLI to connect to it so these are the two ways which you can use to install Redis on your Windows operating system hey guys welcome to the next video on register todel for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install ready on our Linux operating system for this demonstration I will be using Ubuntu operating system so let's get started so there are two ways of installing Redis on our Ubuntu operating system so first of all we can use aptget install to install Redis but there is a disadvantage of installing Redis using app cat and that is the version you will install so with aptget whenever you use app cat to install Redis the repositories are not updated frequently as the Redis version is released so you will be able to see that you have installed the older version of Redis if you use aptget command so for example let's go to this website so search for Redis and the first result which will appear here will be from Redis dot IO and we will see the version of for Redis right now so as I can see here the red is for point zero point zero is the latest version right and we can see using the aptget command so I'm going to open the terminal here in Ubuntu and here I can just type at cash no the version of Redis available right so just write app cache and then policy and then the ready server so just write Redis server okay and then press ENTER and then you will be able to see the version so as far as I can see the version available using aptget command will be 2.8 or something near to that right for my Ubuntu operating system it may be different if you have the more newest version of open I have Ubuntu 14.04 but if you have for example ubuntu 16.04 or ubuntu 17.04 it may be little bit better this version but it will not be the latest version which is four point zero point zero in most of the cases right so if you want the easiest way then you can just write sudo apt get install Redis server okay and then once you press ENTER it's going to install ready server on your open to operating system but the version of this ubuntu server will be 2.8 right so in this case i'm going to show you how you can install the latest version of Redis so for that I'm going to just clear the terminal let's go to the website once again so I'm on the red s dot IO website and I will just click downloads here and then I will go little bit down and I can see the for point zero point zero and I will scroll a little more down and I can see this installation step here and here it's using W get to get this zip file and then we need to unzip the zip file and then we will do CD and then we will make the Redis binaries right so this is the procedure for installing Redis on a Linux operating system or a Mac operating system this procedure will be almost the same right so let's open that terminal first of all and then once the terminal is open we are going to install two packages here one is the build essential package and the other is the TCL package build essential package we use to compile our binaries for the raddest server and TCL package we will use to test our binaries okay so first of all we will give this command sudo apt get update first of all we will update all the repositories and I'm going to give my Ubuntu password so updates is done I'm going to just clear the terminal once again and this time I will give sudo app get install build essential and TCL okay and then press ENTER which is going to install these two packages in my case I can see both the packages are already installed so if they are already installed you will see these kind of message that they are already installed otherwise if they are not present they will be installed on your system so first of all give this command to install these two packages and then once again let me clear the terminal and then we are ready to install Redis using these command which are there on the Redis dot IO website right so the first command is just to download this tar file so what we are going to do is I'm going to first of all make a Redis folder so let me make this folder and kdi are Redis and then I will CD to this Redis folder or directory and inside this directory I'm going to give this w get command which I copied from the Redis website so let me just maximize the terminal and just give this command so w get HTTP download whatever version of the Redis you are downloading so at the time of making this video four point zero point zero is the latest version so you can see this version 4.0 point zero right otherwise this version will be different in your case if the latest version is released right so this just give this command and then press Enter it is going to download this tar file you can see the star profile is downloaded and then let me clear the terminal once again let me do LS once again and now we are going to give the tar command to unzip this tar file so just give this command copy and paste nothing else and then once again LS and you can see this red is for point zero point zero directory is extracted and then we will go inside this Redis directory CD to this directory and then we just need to give them make command so just give make command so just right make here and then press enter which is going to start the making of this Redis binaries it can take some time so just wait for the process to complete so now I can see the make command is successfully completed and at the end of the make command I can see this message which says it's good idea to run make tests after this make come on so I'm going to run make test now so I'm going to just give make test command and then press ENTER and let it run so now the make test command is also finished so now let's go to the next step so I'm going to the website so make test is finished and now it says we just need to go to the source and we need to start the Redis server using the source folder and then Redis server okay and ready CLI will be started from source read is CLI right so let's start ready server first of all so let's do LS here and I can see this source directory right so I can just start the Redis server like this so you just need to give SRC /r Addis so okay and then press Enter which is going to start the Redis server and you can see the Redis server has been started I will just move it to the left hand side this command line terminal and now I will open the next terminal so let me open the next terminal and then in this next terminal I'm going to start the red disk line so I will just go to the Red List directory once again where I have installed or created the binaries and then I will go to the Redis directory and then I will give this Redis command so SRC and then forward slash red as I think so let me do LS once again and yes SRC is here so I will give SRC forward slash Redis client or CLI I think yeah so ready CLI let me just make it a little bit bigger so we can see it perfectly so now you can see we are connected to the server using this IP address and on this port so you can see the Redis server was started on this default port 6 3 7 9 and we are connected to this port using the Redis CLI so let's set something so I'm going to set for example name max for example and then press Enter and it says ok and now I will just say GATT name and its to give me the name max so everything is working fine but one more thing we can do here is because we have installed Redis on some directory on a particular directory every time we need to start Redis we need to CD to that directory and then we need to start the server and we don't want that we want that whenever we give the Redis server command from any directory we just need to start the Redis server so in order to do this what we need to do is let me just minimize this and let me just make some eyes this terminal and we are inside the raddest directory as you already know and you can see the SRC folder is already here right so this is the SRC folder now the last command you can give here is make install so that whenever you give Redis server command from anywhere from any directory it will start the server and know you don't need to navigate to this particular directory in order to start the Redis service so just give make install command in order to install ready server and the ready CLI so let's do that and it says that cannot create regular file because the permissions are denied permission denied that means I need to give the sudo command before the make install so just give sudo make install command here okay so you just need to give sudo make install command and then once again press enter and now the Redis server and ready CLI and other stuff which are there inside this SRC folder is installed right so let me just close this terminal and let me open the fresh terminal now and we are not inside that Redis directory right we are in our home folder and then from here I will just give Redis server command and it will start the server so I don't need to navigate to that's that Redis direct tree because Redis is now installed on on my system in a same way I can start the client so I will just start a new terminal and I will just give Redis CLI to connect to it and I am connected right so in this way you can download and install Redis on your one Linux operating system hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Redis on your Mac operating system so let's just start it and let's see how we can install Redis on our Mac so first of all open up your favorite browser and search for Redis and the first link which will appear here will be from Redis dot IO so we will just click this link which is ready Scott IO and here we can see the homepage of Redis what we want to do here is we want to go to that downloads section so we will just click this option which says download and then when we scroll down a little we can see this downloads button but don't click this download button yet we will see how to install Redis on our Mac while scrolling or down a little so when we scroll down a little here you can see the installation steps for read is so first we need to download the star file and then we need to unzip or unter this tar file and then we need to make the Redis binaries right now let's see what is the latest version at the time of making this video for the Redis so we can see in the Downloads button that four point zero point zero is the latest stable version at the time of making this video right so we will install the four point zero point zero version of Redis now sometimes this dublicate command may not work on your Mac operating system so we will use the curl command to download the star file okay so instead of W gate we will use the curl command and then we will follow the same procedure as described here with some additional commands okay so what we will do first is on my desktop for example or at your chosen location just create a folder so I'm going to create a folder and I'm going to name it as Redis okay so inside this Redis directory I'm going to just download this tar file and unter it and then make the binary is out of it okay so then once I have this folder I will just see the info get the info and then just see what is the path of this Redis directory and I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to open our terminal so just open a terminal and then just CD to this Redis directory so because it's on my desktop I can just use this old location so user and then whatever is your username and then forward slash desktop and then forward slash all Redis I just need to write for slash Redis and then I'm inside this red is folder right now we will do the LS and there is nothing inside this Redis folder and let's just open this folder so we will see what's happening inside this folder okay so let me just resize it so we will see all the things which are happening here and now we will just give a curl command so just write curl and then oh and then the location of this tar file so just copy this URL from here which is there on the downloads page without W get okay so just copy this you and then paste it here on the terminal and then press Enter which is going to download this star file and once it's downloaded we will just unter it so you can see the star file is downloaded right and to untie rate or extract it we will use this command so right click copy and then just paste it here which is going to extract this tar file and we can see this folder is extracted and inside this folder we have some files right so the next step is to CD to this directory which is read is minus four point zero point zero and then make it right so you can see the step CD to this four point zero point zero directory and give them make command so we will do the same CD to the where is four point zero point zero directory and then give a make command which is going to make the binaries for the Redis over and let Reddy's client and other Redis stuff right so now the make is finished and at last I can see this message which says it's a good idea to run make test so let's run make test I'm going to just give this command we just make test and then plus enter so now the make test command is also finished and I can see this message which says all tests passed without error right so I know that everything is okay and now I can start the Redis server and then Redis client okay so let's see what are the command for those so whether server can be started from the source directory and we just need to run this command which is ready server and same we need to do for Redis client so from the source directory we can just run this Redis CLI right so let's do this so I'm going to open a new terminal so let me open a new terminal so now I have two terminals right so on the first terminal I will just do first of all LS here or let me clear the terminal first of all so clear and then I will do LS here and I can see there is a source directory here so I will just get this command SRC and then red is so right so red is server and press enter which is going to start the ready server and it has started listening on this port which is the default port for Redis which is 6 3 7 9 and this is the PID of this Redis server right now once again I will navigate to this directory where I have installed Redis so it's in my desktop and then I'll go to the reddits directory then the red is for point zero point zero and then I will just give this command which is SRC forward slash right as CLI so let me do LS so I know that I am in the same directory and then I will just write SRC and then red is CLI and I'm connected to the Redis server I can see this kind of prompt here that means I'm connected to my already server right so first to test whether everything is working fine or not you just need to write in here and then press ENTER and if in return you get pong then you know that everything is working fine you can also set something so for example set name is equal to max' and then press Enter and then you can get the name so get name and then you can get the name okay and then you can give the save command to save everything for example so everything is working fine but for example when I open a new terminal and I want to run Raditz CLI for example from here how can I do it so I just want to write Redis CLI and I want to run it so let me just correct the spelling here so where does CLI and I want to run it and it says command not found because right now the raddest CLI command can be only run from this directory right so you need to CD to this directory and then run the Redis c'mon so how to solve this problem so this problem can be solved by running the make install command inside your registry so I'm going to just stop the server for now and now I will once again do for example PWDs so you know that in which directory I am in so I'm in my Redis four point zero point zero directory right let me clear the terminal so you will be able to see better so PWD present working directory and you can see I am in my desktop directory and then there is a Redis directory here which is this one and then we are in the raddest for point zero point zero directory right so we have run here the make and make test command and you just need to write make install command here with the sudo privileges so you just need to write sudo make install here and then press enter and you just need to give your max password here and then press enter and then it will start the make install command and then you can see everything is installed and now you can run ready server and red is CLI from anywhere right so let me just close this terminal and close this terminal also let me just terminate everything and I will open a new terminal so that we can check whether it's running from any other place other than this Redis folder or not so I will start to thermals in the first terminal I will write Redis server and it starts from my home directory and now I will give the Redis CLI command so just give it a CLI and then I'm connected to this server right so everything is working fine and now you can start already server and you can use why this CLI command from anywhere from your directory structure right so in this way you can download and install Redis on your Mac operating system hey guys welcome to the next video on register troll for beginners in the last few videos we have seen how we can download and install Redis on our Windows Linux and Mac operating system now further videos I will be making on my Linux operating system that is my open to operating system because more frequently or most frequently this Redis server is installed on a Linux machine and it's used from a Linux machine so it will be more appropriate to go further with this Linux operating system but all the command which I'm will be using on this Linux operating system using the command line are applicable on the Windows terminal also and the Mac terminal also so the command will not change and you just need to start the Redis server and ready CLI on your Windows or Mac OS and then follow these instruction which I'm giving on my human to operating system so if you are on Windows or Mac you just need to follow the same steps you just need to open two terminals on your operating system it can be Mac or it can be your windows and of course the Linux and on one terminal you just need to start the Redis server so I'm going to just start the Redis server here and on the other one you just need to start the Redis CLI okay so looks simple right the same step you need to do on your windows or your Mac ok so once our server is running we can minimize this and start working to interact with the server using the Redis CLI okay now let's start with the data types which are there in Redis and then we will see how we can use one of the data type which is string so basically there are five data types which we can use in Redis and as I already told you that Redis is a key value storage so the key is printable ASCII right and it can be up to 512 megabyte so it can take a really big key for example and it should be a printable ASCII and then we can see the data types of values so the values can be strings and then the containers of string so they can be hashes or lists or sets or sorted sets right so the key are printable ASCII is we can use printable ASCII is for keys and for values we can use strings hashes less sets and sorted sets right and this ready string can be up to 512 megabyte ok now let's start with the practical example so we will start with the basics and we will try to set some values and get some values so for example I have set some values already to this right server so what I will do is to get all the keys which are set you just need to write keys and then the pattern which is s tricks here so Asterix is a wild card and it's going to search all the keys which are saved in your database and then give you the results so for example I have set two keys which is name and name and it has given me both the keys which I have saved right so in order to see all the keys which are saved in your Redis database you just need to write keys and Astrix right now as I already told you that to set some value as a string you just need to use set and then a key for example in this case I'm going to write name 3 because name and name one is already set so I'm going to just set the third key which is name 3 and then I'm going to give some name right and then press ENTER and then once again I will just write keys as tricks and now I can see there are 3 keys stored in my database right so set is to set a string value and as you have already guessed from my previous videos I've shown you this command which is get command and whatever a key you will write here it will give you the value of that key which is Mark in this case right in the same way you can do name to get name and it's going to give you the value of name ok so get and set we are already clear now there is a delete command del ok so using a del and the key name we can delete some key value pair so for example I want to delete name for now and then I will just press Enter is going to give me the number of keys affected and in this case there is only one key with the name and now when I just do this command which is keys Astrix now it just gives me two values which is name and name three and because name he is already deleted so I will not see this name again right in the same way for example I want to delete name three key then also I can do del and then name three and then press enter and I can see the result one he affected and then now only one key left which is name okay so this is how you can delete some value right now let's set these names once again so for example name Tom and once again do the gate for example get name now you will see that the key value of name is overwritten with the name Tom so previously the value of name was mark you can see here and now it's Tom so whenever you set the value of previously set key then whatever value you will give for this key will be overwritten right so value will be overwritten for that key now for example if you want to delete all the values which are stored in our Redis database then we can use flush all command so for example I will set some more values or to see this example for example name is equal to John and then I'm going to give name 3 is equal to max so now we have 3 names so we can just give keys and Astrix to see that so we have 3 keys stored right now for example I want to delete all these keys then I can give flush also just right flush all command and then it's going to delete all the values so it says okay and then once again when we give keys Asterix then you can see empty list or set so all the values are deleted using flush all command so these are some of the most frequently used commands which we can use with the strings in the next video also we will see some of the more commands which we can use with the string values hey guys welcome to the next video on register troll for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use some of the command with the string values now in this video also we will see some more command which we can use with the string values in Redis so let's get started first of all I will show you one command which is valid in Linux terminal also which is the clear command so when you do clear it's going to clear your terminal right so you can see when I have given the clear command it's going to clear the terminal and basically what it does is it just gives some of the some space in between your last command which you have executed and this after this clear okay so now you can see this terminal is totally empty now right and now we can start executing some of the other command so right now our database is totally empty I think so we can check it with keys Astrix and now let's set some values and this time we can use a command which is called set e^x okay and this set e^x is the command which we can use with second so you just need to write set e^x and this means set the value with the expiry of the key okay and then for example I just give the key and then I need to give some second so you can see the next option I need to give here is the number of seconds I want this key to live in my raddest database and after that it will be automatically deleted so for example 10 second I want to give here and then I want to give the value of it for example max okay now when I just press ENTER it's going to say ok and when I just get name it's there right and then there is a command called TTL and then you can use the key with this and it says and what is this so TTL is the command for time to live so it will check for how much time or how long is this key is going to live okay and it says two seconds okay so this is time to live and then the key and then it returns us to second because eight Tests eight second has already passed often after giving this command and once again for example I will just say get name and it's no longer there right because we have just set tensecond expiry on this key so after 10 second it will be automatically deleted right for example I will just give 50 second expiry for example here so 50 max and then I will just give a TTL and then name and then you can see it shows 44 seconds once again 40 second and then it will show you the seconds for which this key is going to live okay and after 36 second it will be deleted right so these are two more command which you can use with the string right now let's set one more value for example set name and name is equal to Tom okay and now we can for example override this value so i stoled you whenever you write something like this set name and some other name for example john then it will overwrite the value of name for example I take name as my key and give some other value it will overwrite but if you don't know if name is there and if you don't want to overwrite name then you can use this command called set and X and this set annex first of all checks if the this key is available or not and if this key is not available then only it's going to you know create this key otherwise it's going to just ignore right so let's give this come on and it says 0 0 because no key is affected due to this command that means when we do get name we can see this name is not overwritten because this command is used or will be successful when this key is not available in the database right if it's available then it's going to just ignore and if it's not available then it's going to create a new value for example I will just give set and X 3 and this value is not available there so I will just give some other name and it says integer 1 that means one value is affected and then I will just do keys Astrix to see the values okay and I can see name is there and name 3 is there that means this was successful right and I can also get the value from get name three also and I can see that value is there let me clear this terminal now if you want to know the length of the value stored in the key then you can just use STR le M command okay and then the key name for example name and it's going to give you the length of that key that means for example I do get name here you can see it's a three character word and that's the length of this value right and that's the result here okay now for example if you want to set multiple values with the same command we use M set so just use M set and then the key and the value for example this time I want to insert some numbers so I will just say num1 and I will just give 50 here and then after a space I will just write num2 and then I will say 60 here num 3 and for example 70 and so on right and then press Enter and I say is okay and then when I say keys keys Astrix it's going to give me name 3 and name which were already there and then num1 and num2 because here you can see I have given the same key two times right so num1 was there num2 and num2 i have given two times let's see the value inside the num so num to get num2 and let's see the value inside it so the value inside is is the last set value so whatever is the last set value you will set for this key it will show you that value here right so once again for example I will just give em set I'm set and then num 3 here and then gave the value of for example 60 here and then once again do the key Asterix is going to give me named three named num tree num to name two and one right so right now I have two names and three numbers inside my database now if we want to set the expiry in millisecond there is a command called P set X and then it takes the value in millisecond you can see in the intellisense also right so I'm not going to set any value here but I just wanted to show you this command also exists which will take the value of seconds in milliseconds right so this is P set X okay now there is a one more command which is called Dec R and incr which we use to increment and decrement the value of some key so for example I want to increment the value of key num1 so let's see the value first of all so value of num1 is right now 50 and then we can just write Dec are num1 and then press enter and now the value becomes 49 right it will give you the result and when you give get num 1 is going to give you the value 49 so this Dec our command will decrement the value by 1 and if you do a and see our command to the num 1 for example once again the value will become 50 so I NCR and Dec are is to decrease and increase the value by 1 okay let me clear this terminal once again now there is one more command to increment or decrement the value by some number and this is for example I NC R by so incr by and the key name for example num1 once again and i want to increment the value of num1 pi5 so earlier it was fifty right and then it's going to become fiftyfive because I have incrementing the value by five in the same way I can do Dec are by and on the same number num1 and for example I want to reduce the value by thirty right and then press ENTER and now it becomes twenty five so you get num1 and the result or the value inside it is 25 now the last command I want to show here is the append command so let me just set one more value for example set and then the key name for example I will name it as my key okay and the value here I want to set is hello okay and then press Enter and then get my key it's hello right now there is a append command so I can just use a PP en D append and as the name suggests I can append something to the key right so I want to append to my key so I will just write the key name and whatever string you want to append here so for example in double quotes I will just give a space here and then I will just write world here okay and then press ENTER and you can see the number of characters I think for the new value right so once again get my key and it's going to give me hello world so space world is appended to the my key right so append is used to append a string so these are some of the other command which you can use with the string values hey guys welcome to the next video on register tool for beginners in the last two videos we have talked about string values in Redis now in this video I'm going to show you how you can use hashes as values in right now first of all what are hashes hashes are map between the string fields and string values hence they are perfect datatype for representation of objects in red is every hash can store up to four billion field value pairs now you may ask that I have talked about key value pairs but what are these field value pairs right so let me show you a slide and then you will be able to understand in a better way so this was the slide similar kind of slide I have shown you in the string data type also right so in the hashes we are talking about hashes now so in the case of hashes the keys are same which are printable ASCII you can see here but in the case of string we were using string array here right and that string array was about 512 megabyte right now in the case of hashes we use this kind of map of field value right so field is this one and value is this one okay in the cases of string it was like a like only a string value right so I will give you an example for example I want to store students database or students in for data then what I can do here is I can say student 1 as a key so student 1 as a key and then for example student has what attribute student has for example name surname age in which class he is so here field can be name and then for example name is equal to mark value 1 can be mark right age is the field 2 for example in this case and then for example 15 is the value 2 here right so name can be field 3 here and then whatever the surname of the and it will be value three right so for every student we can just provide this kind of map for his information so this is how hash data type as well you walk in Redis right now let's take a practical example and then we will be able to understand this concept so I'm going to just start the Redis CLI and let me see what are the keys there so I'm going to just write keys pattern and these are all the keys so I'm going to flush all so let me flush all here so all the keys will be deleted and now I'm going to clear this CLI and let's start with the hashes right so as we have seen in the case of strings we can just use this set command to set a key value pair now in the case of hashes we can use H I am set to set a key field value pair right so for example we were talking about student information database right so just write H M set H stands for hashes here I am set we have already seen in the case of strings also right so just write H am set and then for example s tu1 for student 1 and then for example I will just write name is equal to max' right and then I can also give the second field value pair right so for example his age is equal to 15 and then for example class in which class he is so he isn't for example 8th class okay this is just an example so this is student 1 information let me just give this minus here so we will be able to understand properly and then when I press ENTER it's going to say ok and to get this value there are two ways of getting so you can just say H get and the key name for example s T u minus one is the key name and you can give the field name whatever field you want to get or you can just say get a key name and here get we have already seen in the case of strings also and you just need to add H before it and then the student key name I say is error because we just need to give the field name also so what field there we want to get so we want to get for example name of student 1 it says max here right now if you want to get all the information about student 1 you can just say H get all ok and here you can just give the student one key name and it's going to give you all the you know field value information about the student 1 so for example name max age 15 plus 8 okay so let's add one more student for example so once again this command it's hm set student 2 and then the name for example Tom age is 12 for example and class is 7 okay press enter and once again you can get the information about the student to using s tu minus 2 right so let me clear the terminal so in this way you can just set the hash value and get the hash value right now there is one more command for for example H exists and this will tell you if the field inside this hash cells exists or not so just write H exists and then the key name for example s tu minus 1 and then for example I am searching for surname okay and surname field does not exist in student 1 info right and then I press ENTER and it says integers zero so there is no information about the surname of student 1 right in the case of name this name exists right the name field exist in this student 1 hash set so when I just give this value then it says integer 1 that means it exists so 0 it doesn't exist 1 it exists right now for example I want to delete a value what I can do I can just say H de L and it says first of all I need to give the key name so s tu 1 and I want to delete for example class from it so I'll just write class and then I can just press Enter right and then I can just do H get all and the student 1 key and now you can see class doesn't exist here anymore right for example I want to set once again the same value I can just write H am set and then the same student s tu 1 and then plus 8 ok and then press Enter it says ok and once again H get all student 1 and now once again the class is added here ok so you can add and delete the values from this hash like this so for deleting you use H del and then once again for setting you just add this field value pair now there is one more command called at set and X so H set and X so this this command is used for setting the field value if the field doesn't exist so if the field doesn't exist this command will be successful and if the field exists this command will not be successful so for example I will just say st 1 name so name field already exists right and i will just give some other name to the student 1 right and it says 0 so this command is not successful because this command will be successful only in the case of the field not available right so if I do the same command and I know that surname is not there so I will just write surname and some surname and then press ENTER and returns integer 1 that means it has created this field value inside this student set right so once again when I do get all st 1 now this student 1 also have surname information now as in the case of string we were using keys right so we were writing keys Asterix right same you can use for example H keys here and then the key name for example whatever key you want to give here as 2 u 1 and it gives all the fields in that hash so by field I mean the name and for example age class and surname only the field not the value of those fields so it will only return the fields of that key whatever we provide here now as in the case of string values we were having Dec are decrement or incr for incrementing the value so the same is available in the case of hashes also so for example I want to increase the age of some student by some number I can do that so just write H and then I n CR by and then the key name s T u minus 1 for example and the field name is age I want to increment his age and then right now the age is 15 for example and I want to increase the age by 2 and then press ENTER and then once again when I do H get all s t1 now you can see the age becomes 17 right so in order to increment the value you just write H incr by and the key and the field which you want to increment now if you want to know all the values of a particular key then we can just write H Wells and then the key name as to u1 it will just give you the values of that field value pair right so right now it's not giving name or age or class or surname it's only giving the values of them which is max and then 17 8 and the surname value right so H mel's is for value okay now if you want to know the length of some hash for example I will just give this command @l e n and then the s tu 1 the key name minus 1 it will return you the number of fields in that hash okay so press ENTER and it returns for so I know that student 1 key has numb for number of field name age class and surname so I can just verify that with that okay so for field so it will return number 4 now the last command I want to show here is H M get so let me clear the terminal and then I just want to write H and get and it will give you the result whatever fields you want so for example for st one st one for example i just want to know the name of that student ID i don't want any other information about that in student but only the name then it will give me the name right and for example i just want to know the name and age even though the student hash contains surname and class also but i just want to know the name and age it will just give me the name and age when I use HM gate than the key name and the field name I want to see so the field name I want to see right now is name an age so I just give name and age it'll give me the result of those field only so in this way you can use hashes in ready hey guys welcome to the next video on register tool for beginners in this video we will learn how to use Redis lists so first of all what are red is lists so Redis lists are simply lists of strings sorted by their insertion order right so as I already said that a Redis list is simply as list of string which are sorted by their insert and order so our list would have head on the top and tail on the bottom right now in this list we can insert any element from the top also and from the bottom also right so element can be inserted to a list from the top or from the bottom now sometimes you see lists in a horizontal way right not in a vertical way but on a horizontal way right now if you see a list in a horizontal way your head will be on the left hand side right so your head will be on the left hand side and your tail will be on the right hand side right so Radice have some command for example ll push L push means the left port that means we want to push an element from the head right left and had our same in the case of lists so this is how red is less work it's simply a list with the insertion order now let's see how we can use lists in Redis so I'm going to start a terminal I have already started my Redis server so I'm going to just start the Redis CLI here and then press ENTER and I want to show you one more Redis command which is a ready CLI command and I thought this would be interesting to you so I'm going to open a next terminal and here also I will just give a Redis CLI command and I will give an argument here so I will just give monitor command yeah okay so monitor so ready CLI monitor and what this monitor is going to do is it's going to monitor all the commands which you are executing from your CLI so for example let me give keys Astrix come on here right and now you can see it's showing us that we have given this command keys Asterix at this time this is a timestamp at which this command is given okay so this is the timestamp at which this command is given and this is the command which we have given right so let's do flush all here and then press enter and you can see this flush all command is printed here so this is kind of a monitor right so this is going to monitor what are the command you are giving to your Redis so okay so let's start with the Redis lists so first of all how we can create our Redis list so you can create a Redis list by just giving this command you just need to I'll push right so al push means left push that means we want to insert an element from the top right from the head okay and then we just need to give any key here for example key here I'm going to give num for numbers right and the first key I want to insert here will be for example 1 okay so first number right you can even insert multiple values here for this key for this list for example 2 3 & 4 ok and then press Enter and these four elements are inserted to the list in this order right now to see all the values in the list you use L range commands so just use L range and then the name of the key for example number in our case and then you give the you know start and stop value for the range now already slist index start from zero so for example starting value we can give zero here and let's say we want to just see the values in the list from zero to ten ok and then press Enter it shows us these values from four three two and one right so because we were pushing the values from the top we have pushed one first right so it will be pushed from the top one and then we have pushed two so the top value will become two now when we push two here and that's why it's a reverse order of numbers right so first we have pushed one and then we have pushed two at the top and then we have pushed three at the top and at the last we have pushed for at the top so that's why the number four is at the top of the list and number one is at the bottom of the list right now if we want to push number five on the top we can just do L push here so just do L push and the key name and then for example I will do number five here right and then press ENTER and once again I will do L range you can see five is at the top now if you want to remove the value from the top you give the L pop come on okay so L pop command is going to remove the value from the left hand side left hand side means from the top okay so L PAP pop is going to pop the value from the top and in this case our key is numb and you can see it has popped five from the top that means our list is now up to four okay so let's give the same command and range zero to ten and now our list is one two three four because we have removed five from the top okay let me clear the terminal and then I'm going to show you one more command so let's start with the L range so we have right now four elements in the list now there is a our push command and our pop command also okay so when you do our push that means right push that means from the bottom you are pushing some numbers right so from the bottom for example I want to push the value v Heer okay first of all and just need to give the key a name and then from the bottom I want to push the number five and then press Enter and I will do L range one those again you can see this value goes at the bottom five goes at the bottom because we have our push we have used this command our push our push means from the bottom push from the bottom right from the right hand side of the list okay that's why this five goes at the bottom okay once again let's do this our push and let's push six at the bottom and once again do L range I give you and you can see in the list you have the six at the bottom so in Redis this list is sorted by the insertion order right if you push from the right it will go at the bottom and if you push from the left it will go at the top and four left push you use L push and four right push you use our push now as we have seen in the case of L pop L pop is going to pop the value from the top our pop is going to pop the value from the bottom so just came our pop here and then the key name and it's going to pop six from the list which is from the bottom right let's do L range command once again and now you can see a six is gone from the list in a same way less two are pop once again and now five is gone from the list so once again let's do L range and now we have a list of four numbers right let me clear the terminal here now let's give L range command once again and now there is a command called L Len okay this means left length and name of the key for example it's going to give you the length of the list in our case this length is equal to the number of element in the list okay so L Len is for knowing the length of the list now for example if you want to get some value at some index you just do L index command okay and then the name of the key and the index so index start from zero so zero one two three okay so for example we want to get number two here at index 3 so we will just say index three okay and it's going to give you the number one because index starts from zero so zero one two and three so index 3 is the value 1 here okay let's do index zero here and it's going to give us the value 4 now there is one more command called L set so you can use as set and the key name and then you can give the index at which you want to insert a value right so for example I want to insert the value at the very top so the very top is the index zero right and then the value itself so I want to insert the value at the 0th index and the value is five and then when I just press ENTER it says okay and when I do L range you can see at the top at the 0th index this value 4 is replaced by value 5 right so the size of the list remains the same but the value is replaced at the residual 0th index and now the new value is 5 here now let me push some more values here so I'll push you can do are push also wherever you want so L push num and for example I want to push number 6 here and then number 7 and number 8 here ok and let's do L range and you can see all the values are here right now sometimes you don't know the range or the length of your list so for example you just to 0 to 3 here it's going to just give you 0 to 3 values right now if you don't know the length of your list you can give L range and then 0 to minus 1 so let's give this command and you can see it gives all the elements in the list so when you do L range the key name 0 to minus 1 is going to give you all the element in the list right this was giving the values from 0 to 10th index so if our list is of length 20 this is going to give you only 10 values 0 to 10 right but this is going to give you all the 20 values if you your list length is 20 now let me clear this terminal and let's go to the next command so now the next command is El push X and that means l.push if the key exists okay so the left push if the key exists so we know that we have created a list with the key num right so let's do first of all this el range right and then we will give this el push X okay and this means that insert to this list for example this key exists already so insert to the list if this key already exists which you are providing here okay and this is the left push so we want to push one more value to the top so let's push nine at the top and because this key num exists this command is successful right so let's do el range once again and this key is inserted at the top let's say we do ll push X for a key which doesn't exist for example let's say we have a key for subjects so let's say the key is sub here and we want to push some keys for example once again 1 2 3 4 5 ok but this key doesn't exist right and then when we press ENTER it returns zero because this command is not successful because this command checks whether this key exists or not and if this key exists then it's it's pushing these values on the top right but because this key doesn't exist this command fails and there is no list will be created now the next command I want to show here is L insert before or after so you just do L insert here and then the key name for example num here and you have the option before or after so before after are the keyword for example I use the keyword before here so I'm going to just write before and the pivot name pivot name is this element okay so I want to insert the value before two for example okay so let me write to here and the value is this time for example 55 okay so I'll insert the key name and you can use this keyword before or after here and then the pivot and then the value once again I do press ENTER and you can see now the less size is 9 and when I do I'll range 0 to minus 1 you can see this 55 is inserted before right before 2 is the index from the left right because we have done the L insert okay so before 2 is inserted 55 right you can do after also so for example I want to insert after 3 okay I'll let insert after four so after five we want to insert the value 4 you can see after 5 there is 3 right so after 5 there is a value 3 and we want to insert 4 value 4 here and now our list is of size 10 and you can see now after 5 comes for okay and above 3 comes for okay so this L insert is used to insert the value before or after some value so these are some of the frequently used command with radius list hey guys welcome to the next video and registered role for beginners and in this video we will learn what are sets and how to use sets in Redis so first of all what are sets so ready sets are an unordered collection of unique strings right so by unique I mean whatever values set contains they are all unique so no repetition is allowed here okay and they are unordered you know lists so they are not ordered and they are unique so let's see how we can use sets in practice so I have already started my already server and on my CLI first of all let me just clear all the keys which I already have so I will just say keys and I have only one key which I'm going to flush all and now let's create a set okay so to create a set you can just use s for set and then add okay so s add and then give any a name any name to a key so for example my set is a key here and then you can add members here one or many okay so for example I want to have a set of numbers so let me say this is my first set so I will name it set one my set one and let's say I add here 1 2 3 4 for example ok and I just press Enter which is going to create a set and add these four numbers now here I have provided four different numbers right so they are all unique and to view the members of a set you just to s members ok so s members and the key named Mikey name is my set 1 and you can view all the members of the set right now for example in this set I want to add one more value so I just say s add and then my set 1 and I want to add 3 here right and I already know the here I already have three in my set and I want to you know add one more tree to the set which is not allowed right so it's going to give me zero in return that means this 3 is not added to the set because 3 is already there okay we can just prove with this by using s members and then the set name so you can see set is not changed the values in the set remains same because they must be unique okay on the other hand when I do as set 1 5 which is a new member in the set I can just verify this so you can see this time it's added and you can verify it with this value if you get one here that means the number is added to the set and if you get 0 here that means number is not added to the set right now for example if I want to know how many values are there in the set so how many members are there in the set so I can just do s card and then the name of the set my set 1 ok my set 1 and I can see there are 5 members in the set ok now let me create one more set so I have my set 1 let me clear the terminal first and now I will create set so set add or s add my side to here ok and let me add some more numbers here this time I will add for example 5 8 7 6 4 and 9 in this set ok and then press enter and I can view this set by s members here and the key name has said and you can see these are the member of second set right now if you have multiple sets you can subtract one set from other using s diff ok so you can use as Dave and this active command returns and members of the set resulting from the difference between the first set and all other successive sets so this is the difference so I will just add my set one as my first set and then I will just give the second set as my set to ok and then press ENTER and it's going to give me the difference between these two set let me show you the values of the set 1 also so we can verify so you can see in the set 1 we have value 1 to 5 and then in the set to we have values 4 5 6 7 8 9 so from s diff it's going to give you the values which are there in the set 1 but they are not there in the set okay so these values these 3 values are not there in the set right but 4 & 5 are there in the set so they are discarded so as diff is going to give you the difference that means whatever values are there in set 1 and not there in set 2 now if you want to know the S diff and save it into the third set for example then you can do that also so you can just write as diff and then store and then the destination so I'm going to save the difference in a new set so for example my set 3 right and then the difference between these 2 sets so my set 1 and my set 2 so these 3 values will be saved in the new set which is my set 3 ok press Enter and then you can see by s members my set 3 you can see all these values are saved in this set 3 which is the difference between my set 1 and my set now you can do the union also union of the set so for example I want to do Union I can just write s Union and the set name so my set 1 and my set ok so I wanted to do the union of set 1 and set 2 and then press ENTER and it's going to give you these values so Union means whatever values which are there in the first set also and second set also the combination of that unique value right so all the unique value which are there in the first set and second set so these value were in the first set and these value which are unique in the second set so this is the combination of s Union ok and same you can do for storing so you can just write s Union store here so just write s Union store and I'm going to store it in set for for example so my set for the union of set 1 and set to right press enter and union is saved I can do s member my set for and you can see now it has one two nine which is the union of set one and set to okay so in order to store use s Union store now if I want to remove some members from a set I can do s RAM for removing a value from a set or member from a set and for example I want to remove some member from set for and I want to remove for example nine okay and then press Enter it's going to remove nine from the set for and I can do s members one that once again and you can see nine is not there anymore okay you can remove multiple values for example eight seven six and so on and these will be removed so now I have only up to five values because eight seven six are removed now for example I want to remove a random value from the set so I don't want to remove a specific value but I want to remove as random value so for example I can do s pop here to remove a random value from a set so my set for for example and for example I want to remove only one value from here right so I can just press Enter it says three so it has removed three from this set okay so let's do s member s 4 and you can see 3 is no more there in the set for okay so it has picked a random value from this set and removed it okay I can give for example as pop my set for I for example I want to remove two random values so I can just do that and now it has removed four and one from the set and now my set is only of two values or two members two and five okay so as pop is to remove the random value from the set now let me clear this terminal and let me just print the values of set one and set to once again so set one has one two five and said to have four to nine now there is a command called as inter and as inter command gets the element of a set after the intersection of all the specified set okay so it's going to give you the intersection of all the specified set so just to s inter for example my set 1 and my set 2 and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the intersection intersection means these values are there in both the sets so these are the intersection of both the sets so 4 & 5 are there in set 1 and set 2 so it's going to give you those value only and as we have seen in the case of as deaf and as Union you can do for example as interst store so you can store the intersection into a new set so as inter store and for example I want to save this in set five and then press ENTER and then I can just see the content of set 5 which is 4 & 5 which is correct now the last command I want to show here is s move command so as move and this command is used to you know transfer or move value or member from one set to the another set right so for example I want to move one from my set one to my set okay so I want to move this value to the set so what I can do so first of all the source source is my set one and I want to move it to the destination which is my set and I want to transfer the value one member one right so press Enter it says 1 that means the operation is successful so let me see the s member or members of set and now you can see one is moved to the set earlier one was not there in the set but now we have one in the set and let's see the contents of set one also so you can see one is no longer there in set one because it's moved from set one to set two so these are some of the most frequently used command in Redis sets hey guys welcome to the next video on register twirl for beginners and in this video we will learn how we can use sorted sets in Redis so first of all what are sorted sets so ready sorted sets are similar to the Redis sets with a unique feature that their members can be sorted now every member of a sorted set is associated with a score and based on the score their members can be sorted right so you can see in this diagram the raddest key will remain the same as other patterns but here you can see a score here so you can define a score for example I will define a score 100 and then the value associated with the score so the value associated with the score is well you and this is our member of a set and there is a new feature in the sorted set which is this score right so you can define a score and with this score you can define a member or a value associated with it and then on the basis of that we can sort the members of our set right so let's see in practical how it works so I'm going to open my Redis CLI so the first command we are going to learn here is that ad and the said ad is used to create a set if it doesn't exist or add a member to this set if it already exists right so every command in sorted set will start with this character Z and then whatever its function is the function name for example right so that ad and then the key name for example my set 1 and the score so score is 1 and the value associated with it so squarely for example you want to associate it with the score one is a write in a similar way we can define multiple score members here so score and the value associated whether 2 and B for example 3 is the third score and the value we want to associate with it C and then they need not be in order so score can be 5 now and the value can be D here right or any other value right and then press enter and you can see for bows are inserted in the sortedset now to get the members of a sorted set you use Z and then range command okay as we have seen in the sets also and then what is your key name for example my set 1 and then starting value and end value as we have seen in the case of sets also so in the case of sets we have seen that 0 and minus 1 are going to give all the values in the set right so press ENTER and you can see here all the values are printed here now you can see here the values are printed not the you know schools associated with them right so for example I once again write Z add and then set 1 my set 1 and then for example I can just give score 100 here and then the value is here right and then press Enter and once again I will just give that range my set 1 and then you can see all the values here or all the members here but these are not the school's these are just order ordered number now if you want to know how many number of members are there in our set we can use Z card here ok and the key name for example my set 1 and then press Enter and I can see that there are 5 members in my sorted set right now in order to get the count of members in the sorted set with the scores within the given range we use said count okay and then the key name so my set 1 and the minimum and the maximum score value here so for example I want to get 1 2 3 here ok and then press Enter and then it's going to count the number of values between this range right so for example just write 1 2 5 here and values are 4 because in between school 1 and school 5 there are 4 values including those scores now I can just write 1 250 here or 55 and still it's going to give us 4 values number of values because the last score we have associated here is hundred so when we write here 1 0 1 here and then press ENTER then only it's going to give us 5 values and let's see we can give 99 here still it gives the 4 value so the z count is going to take the score values and then depending upon the score values is going to give you the number of values in between these scores now let me clear the terminal and to remove any member from a set you use Z REM and then the key name my set and member so the member here will be the member value so not the score but the member so for example I want to remove the member B so I can just give the value of member of B and then press ENTER and once again I will just give this sled range command and now it's giving the same answer because I haven't given the right key name so I must give that a my set 1 here right and then it gives integer 1 that means the command is successful and once again the range and now you can see the value is removed from here now if you want to determine the index of a member in a sorted set you use that rank here so just give rows that rank amount and then my set 1 and the member name so for example d here and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the index of this D right so the index starts from 0 so 0 1 2 right for example I want to see the index of e here I was going to give me the index 3 and for example for member a the index is 0 now there is a Z Reb rank command also so you can just write Z Rev rank here and this is the reverse rank right so the rank will be sorted according to the score so highest score is the 0th index right and then the lowest score is the maximum index okay so for example my set 1 and then the member name for example e is the rank 0 here right because index of e is the highest rank rank is 100 for e right and it's the biggest rank that means the index for it will be 0 because we are printing the reverse rank here ok for example you want to see the index of a it will be 3 because it's in reverse order now the last command I'm going to show you here is zscore command ok and then I can give the key name and the member name so for example I will give the member a and then press Enter it's going to give me the score value of this member right so for example I want to see the score of member E and press Enter it's going to give me hundred because score associated with II was hundred right and for example this value doesn't exist in our sorted set for example I just added or given the random value here and then press Enter it's going to return the nil value which doesn't exist okay now let me clear the terminal let me show one more command to you so for example I just want to print the range of my set 1 0 to minus and this is a CDE and I want to add one more value here so I will just add said add and I want to add this value to my set one and at the score one and I want to add for example a a five times and then press ENTER and it and it returns me one that means the value for this score is now set to a a instead of a for example right so let me do set range once again and you can see here the new value is added here which is e right and if you remember the score of a was also one right so let me give the same command now which is zscore and this time I want to just see the score of a which is 1 and then I want to see the score of AAA which is also 1 so it's totally fine if you give a same score to multiple values right so for example I want to give one more value to this score for example BBB B and then press ENTER and once again the range I want to see this value is added and then I want to see you see the score of BBB B so BBB B and you can see the score is still 1 okay so it's totally fine to have one score for multiple values now what happens to the rank here so for examples red rank for my set 1 so my set 1 and then BBB B and the index here is 2 so this is how sorted set works now there is one more command which is Z range by score and then you can give the key name and then the score value minimum score for example 1 and then the maximum score for example I'm going to give you a two right and then press ENTER and I get here three values because there are three values associated with the score one and I think there was no score for two right so no value was associated with two so let's see one two four for example and now I can see these values and see also so if you want to get values by the range of scores then you can use that range by score okay so this is how you can use sorted sets in Redis there are some more commands which are associated with sorted set you can just search for them and then practice them but these are some of the most frequently used command with the sorted sets hey guys welcome to the next video on register rule for beginners in this video we will learn how to use Redis publish/subscribe so Redis publish/subscribe implements the messaging system where sender is called the publisher and the receiver is called the subscriber right now in Redis a client can subscribe to any number of channels so let me give you an example and let me show you how you can use Redis publish subscribe so you can see I have opened three ready CLI terminals in three different terminals right so this is ready CLI first terminal second terminal and third terminal now first of all I am going to subscribe to a channel so I can just write subscribe here and then it takes a channel name right and I can give any channel name for example Redis or any other channel name so for example my channel and I can subscribe to this channel okay so the name depends upon you right so for example I subscribe to the channel called Redis and I just press ENTER so now this is or this terminal is subscribed to this channel right now from the second CLI when I publish some message to this channel so let me publish something so to publish a message you can just use a keyword publish as we have seen in subscribe so to subscribe you use a keyword subscribe and then a channel name for publishing you use a keyboard publish and the channel name on which you want to publish right so I want to publish on the Redis channel and then your message for example hi right and I press enter and you can see on the subscriber it gets the same message so first of all it will just show you what kind of message is coming so it's a message and then on what channel it's coming and what is the message itself right now if you want to send a big message you can just enclose your message inside these double quotes so for example hello world here and then press enter then it's received here okay now it's possible to subscribe to any number of channels right so you can see I am subscribed to Redis from one channel now I can just copy the same command in the next terminal here and then I'm subscribed to this channel so now there are two subscriber subscribe to one Redis channel so this is the channel and I'm subscribed to that channel right so there are two subscriber for the channel named Redis and when I just send hello world again for example now it is received by both the subscribers right so you can see hello world is received here and hello world is received here okay so this is how publish/subscribe method work in Redis now when you are doing or using Redis in the programming then it's really important or it's really useful so for example recently I created some kind of API where I wanted to listen for any event for save in Redis so whatever is saved whenever some command comes and something is saved in Redis I wanted to subscribe to that save event right and I have used this publish/subscribe method from Redis in that API and it worked fine so it's kind of listening to the trigger for examples for saving the data or some delete deletion of data you can subscribe and then you will get this message on the next side which is subscribing and based on that subscription you can trigger some event okay now let me just close this CLI and once again open the CLI once again and let me clear the terminal once again and there is a command called P subscribe so you can do P subscribe and then it takes the pattern so for example I can just write R and then s tricks are s tricks here means any publisher when it's published on the channel name which start with r it will receive that message so for example I am publishing this publish Redis because this pattern matches this pattern so Asterix is some kind of a wild card here so it's whatever so for example I'm subscribing to RS tricks and I'm just publishing the same message again and you can see it's receiving that message because it's just matching the pattern whatever publisher publishes on the pattern which matches rs tricks for example R and whatever comes after R this is matching that pattern so it will receive that message for example I can just do something like this I publish on R X for example this also matches this pattern right because we just want to match the first letter of that channel and whatever comes after that it will be matched automatically so this is kind of a pattern matching in Redis so P subscribe is used to pattern matching and whatever publisher channel matches that pattern it will be receiving that message so you can see this is receiving that message but this CLI is not receiving so because we have subscribed to a concrete channel layer which is not a pattern so whenever we just give the raddest channel itself then only it will receive the message and this automatically receives the message because here we are just matching the pattern okay so in this way you can use publish subscribe in Redis I hope you have enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
