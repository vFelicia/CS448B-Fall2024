00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Java jdk on your Mac operating system in
00:08 - addition I'm also going to show you how
00:10 - you can set the Java home in your Mac
00:13 - operating system and also I'm going to
00:16 - show you how you can run a Java file
00:19 - once you have installed Java on your Mac
00:22 - operating system so let's start with the
00:24 - download of java so for that open your
00:28 - favorite browser and search for download
00:30 - Oracle Java on Mac and the first link
00:34 - which will appear here will be from
00:36 - oracle.com
00:38 - SL Java SL Technologies SL download I'm
00:42 - going to click on this link maybe I will
00:45 - also put this link in the description of
00:47 - this video so you can directly come to
00:49 - this website now at the time of making
00:52 - this video you can see Java 21 and Java
00:55 - 177 are available now what we are going
00:59 - to do do is we are going to download the
01:02 - version Java
01:04 - 21 now when you scroll down a little you
01:08 - will see three sections for Linux Mac OS
01:11 - and windows we are going to click on the
01:13 - Mac version and then you will see uh
01:18 - different variants which you can
01:20 - download we are interested in
01:22 - downloading the DMG installer but here
01:26 - there are two variants of DMG installer
01:29 - also so if you are using M1 or M2 Mech
01:35 - then you need to select this one which
01:38 - is arm 64 DMG installer if you are using
01:43 - Intel backed Mac operating system then
01:47 - you need to choose the last uh one which
01:51 - is x64 DMG installer I am having the M2
01:56 - Chip on my Mac operating system so I'm
01:59 - going to choose CH the second option
02:01 - which is arm 64 DMG installer so I'm
02:04 - going to click on this link which is for
02:07 - the download of this DMG file you can
02:10 - see the download of this G DMG file has
02:13 - been started so it's not going to take
02:16 - much time to download just wait for the
02:19 - download to complete and once the
02:21 - download is complete you can see this
02:23 - DMG file is downloaded so I can directly
02:26 - click on this DMG file here and let me
02:29 - minimize the browser and you will see
02:32 - this kind of window here in order to
02:35 - install Java jdk using this window you
02:38 - just need to click on this PKG file so
02:41 - I'm going to click on this PKG file
02:44 - which is going to start the installation
02:46 - process let me minimize this window also
02:49 - so this is the installer window we are
02:51 - going to just click on continue on the
02:53 - first window here and then it says this
02:56 - will take around 336 megabyte of space
02:59 - on your computer Compu I'm okay with it
03:01 - so I'm going to click on install here
03:03 - and then I need to give my macbook's
03:06 - password so I'm going to provide the
03:08 - password here and then click on install
03:11 - software which is going to start the
03:13 - installation of Java jdk on my Mac
03:17 - operating system and in few seconds this
03:20 - window will appear which says install
03:22 - succeed so now I can close this window
03:26 - so basic installation of java has been
03:30 - done when I press on close it says do
03:33 - you want to move jdk installer to bin
03:36 - yes because the Java installation is
03:38 - finished we can move this uh DMG file to
03:41 - the bin so I'm going to just click on
03:43 - that and that file will be moved to the
03:46 - bin now Java jdk is installed on my Mac
03:51 - operating system now the next step in
03:54 - this process is to set the Java home so
03:58 - for that what we we need to do we need
04:01 - to first of all find out where Java is
04:04 - installed on our Mac operating system so
04:07 - for that we are going to open the
04:09 - terminal so just click on this Spotlight
04:12 - icon and then search for terminal and
04:16 - then open the terminal from here so
04:18 - generally once you install Java jdk its
04:20 - location is for/ USR SL
04:26 - libexec slash Java home so Java uncore
04:31 - home and then you need to give hyphen
04:34 - and then capital V and it's going to
04:37 - give you the version of java which you
04:39 - have installed so this is the version
04:43 - which we have installed which is Java 20
04:47 - 1.0.1 once we know the version of uh
04:50 - Java so now in The Next Step what we
04:53 - need to do is we need to set or export
04:57 - the path of java home
05:00 - in our bash RC file or zshrc file now if
05:05 - you are using the newer version of Mac
05:08 - operating system most probably by
05:11 - default your Mac terminal is using zsh
05:14 - so we are going to set the Java home in
05:18 - the zshrc file now this zshrc file is
05:23 - located in your home folder so when you
05:28 - do p D and when you open the terminal
05:31 - for the first time this is the home
05:33 - folder of your Mac operating system or
05:37 - for your particular user right and this
05:41 - zshrc is located in this directory so
05:46 - how to uh know that you can do LS space
05:51 - hyphen Al and then press enter and you
05:55 - will be able to see this kind of file
05:58 - which says Dot
06:00 - zshrc now if this file is not present
06:04 - you don't need to worry about it we will
06:06 - create a new. zshrc file so if this file
06:11 - is present we will add our location to
06:14 - it if it's not present we will first
06:17 - create this file and then we are going
06:19 - to add our export now you can use any
06:23 - Editor to uh edit or create this file if
06:26 - this zshrc file is not there you can uh
06:30 - use this touch command and then write do
06:35 - zshrc and then press enter and it's
06:38 - going to create your do zshrc file in my
06:42 - case it's already present so I'm not
06:44 - going to give this command the next
06:46 - command is using a text editor you need
06:49 - to open this file you can use Nano to
06:52 - open the dot zsh file or if you are the
06:56 - fan of text editor then you can use open
06:59 - also so just write open and then write
07:02 - do
07:04 - zshrc which is the name of this file and
07:08 - then press enter which is going to open
07:11 - this zsh file using the text editor let
07:16 - me make this uh text a little bit bigger
07:18 - so you can see
07:20 - here so I already have one export here
07:23 - in your case if you have created this
07:26 - file for the first time you will not see
07:28 - any export here it will be blank what
07:31 - you need to do here is you need to copy
07:33 - and paste these two lines here I'm going
07:36 - to paste these two lines in the
07:39 - description of this video also so you
07:41 - can directly copy them and paste it into
07:44 - your terminal so the first command is
07:47 - export Java unor home is equal to dollar
07:50 - and then this is the path which we have
07:53 - uh seen in the terminal so we have used
07:58 - this path right user SL lib exact SL
08:02 - Java home space hyphen version and we
08:06 - got this version in my case right 21.0
08:11 - point1 so here we have given the same
08:14 - path hyphen version and instead of this
08:18 - version you need to give the version
08:21 - which you see after giving this command
08:25 - so in my case the version is
08:28 - 2.0.1 so I'm going to replace this
08:32 - version with 21.0 point1 so let me just
08:36 - write 21. 0.1 here and then in the next
08:41 - line you need to uh give this command
08:44 - which is export space path is equal to
08:47 - Dollar Java home/ bin colon dollar path
08:53 - right so these two lines you need to
08:55 - copy and paste and don't forget to
08:58 - change the version with the version
09:00 - which you have once you are done you can
09:04 - save this file so I'm going to just uh
09:07 - click on the file option and then click
09:10 - on Save which is going to save this shrc
09:14 - file and then I'm going to close this
09:17 - once this is closed you can verify that
09:21 - your changes are saved by just giving
09:24 - the same command once again is openspace
09:27 - do zshrc
09:29 - and I can see that my changes are
09:32 - already there so I know that my changes
09:36 - are saved right once your changes are
09:39 - saved the next command you need to write
09:43 - here is this one so let me clear the
09:46 - terminal because uh it's full so after
09:51 - uh saving your export you just need to
09:53 - give this command which is source and
09:57 - then give the name of your file which is
10:00 - do
10:01 - zshrc and then press enter if you don't
10:05 - give this command then do zshrc will not
10:08 - load in the current terminal so if you
10:12 - don't give this command just close your
10:14 - terminal and then reopen the terminal
10:16 - once again okay so you can also do this
10:20 - so I'm going to just close this terminal
10:23 - and then quit from this terminal and
10:26 - then once again open the terminal
10:30 - and once the terminal is open I can
10:33 - check the Java home is set or Not by
10:36 - giving Echo command so I'm going to just
10:39 - give echo dollar Java uncore home and
10:44 - then press enter and it's going to give
10:46 - you the location of java home in my case
10:50 - it's uh Library SL Java SL Java virtual
10:54 - machine SL jdk 21. jdk contents for
10:59 - slome okay so if you have followed all
11:02 - the step which I have shown you you will
11:04 - see this kind of
11:05 - output now once uh Java home is set and
11:11 - Java is installed we can also check the
11:13 - version of java so you can give this
11:15 - command which is Java space
11:19 - hyphen version and then press enter and
11:22 - it's going to give you the version of
11:24 - java which is
11:25 - 2.0.1 in my case so Java is now
11:30 - successfully installed on my Mac
11:33 - operating system so now let's try to
11:36 - create a Java file where we will uh
11:39 - write a very simple hello world program
11:42 - and then we are going to compile it and
11:44 - then we are going to try to run that
11:47 - Java program so I'm going to clear the
11:50 - terminal and now you need to navigate to
11:54 - the folder where you want to uh create
11:57 - your Java project so right now I'm in my
12:00 - home directory you can uh just do LS
12:03 - here and here I have a few folders right
12:08 - so let's say I want to create a new Java
12:12 - project in the documents folder so I'm
12:14 - going to go or CD into my documents
12:17 - folder and then here let me create a
12:22 - folder called let's say I'm going to
12:24 - just create a folder using mkd command
12:29 - and then uh I will just name my uh
12:32 - folder as projects here and then press
12:34 - enter which is going to create this my
12:37 - project directory in the documents
12:39 - folder I can do LS once again and then
12:42 - you can see this my project directory is
12:45 - created so I'm going to go inside this
12:47 - directory CD and then the name of the
12:50 - directory and here I'm going to create a
12:53 - new Java file so in order to create a
12:56 - new Java file you can can uh use Touch
13:00 - command so just write touch and then the
13:03 - name of your Java file for example I'm
13:06 - going to create a file with the name
13:08 - hello and then the extension for this
13:11 - will be Java okay so just write touch
13:15 - space hello. Java which is going to
13:17 - create this hello. Java file in your my
13:21 - project directory so when I do LS you
13:24 - can see hello. Java file is created I
13:29 - can also go to my finder and then go to
13:32 - uh my uh documents folder where I have
13:35 - created this my projects folder where I
13:37 - can see that this hello. Java file is
13:42 - there so let me uh do this side by side
13:45 - so you will be able to see the output
13:48 - also in this Finder right so we have
13:51 - created this hello. Java file now uh you
13:55 - can open this hello. Java file by just
13:58 - right click clicking on it and then you
13:59 - can use open with and then use text edit
14:04 - and it's going to open this hello. Java
14:06 - file so once this hello. Java file is uh
14:10 - created I'm going to uh paste this very
14:14 - simple Java program here you can find
14:17 - this program anywhere on Internet it's
14:20 - just printing hello world using Java
14:23 - right so just write public space class
14:27 - space hello and and then in this class
14:29 - you need to create a main method with
14:33 - public stated void Main and then uh you
14:36 - need to uh write system. out. print line
14:41 - and in the parenthesis and between the
14:44 - codes just write hello world as I said
14:46 - you will find this program anywhere on
14:48 - internet so you don't need to worry
14:50 - about it just copy and paste this kind
14:53 - of hello world program in your Java file
14:55 - and then I'm going to save this file to
14:57 - save this
14:59 - file to save this file you just need to
15:02 - click on file and then click on uh save
15:06 - or just press command s to save the file
15:09 - once you have saved your program in
15:11 - order to compile your Java file you need
15:15 - to run this command which is Java C it's
15:19 - not a Java command it's a Java C command
15:22 - if you want to compile a Java file so
15:25 - just write Java C and then the name of
15:28 - your Java file in my case it's hello.
15:32 - Java right this is the name of the file
15:34 - hello. Java I'm going to press enter
15:37 - which is going to compile this hello.
15:41 - Java program and it's going to create
15:43 - this file which is hello. class this is
15:47 - the output of your compilation of your
15:50 - Java file once you see hello. class file
15:54 - created now it's time to run your
15:57 - program to run the program write Java
16:01 - and then the name of the file you need
16:04 - don't need to give the extension do
16:06 - class here you can just write hello here
16:09 - without class and then press enter and
16:12 - it's going to print hello world which is
16:15 - the output of my compilation of my Java
16:18 - program so this is how uh you can run
16:22 - your Java programs using the Java
16:26 - command and you can compile your Java
16:29 - programs using the Java C file so this
16:32 - is how you can download and install Java
16:35 - jdk set Java home and compile your Java
16:40 - programs on your Mac operating system I
16:43 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
16:45 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Java jdk on your Mac operating system in addition I'm also going to show you how you can set the Java home in your Mac operating system and also I'm going to show you how you can run a Java file once you have installed Java on your Mac operating system so let's start with the download of java so for that open your favorite browser and search for download Oracle Java on Mac and the first link which will appear here will be from oracle.com SL Java SL Technologies SL download I'm going to click on this link maybe I will also put this link in the description of this video so you can directly come to this website now at the time of making this video you can see Java 21 and Java 177 are available now what we are going to do do is we are going to download the version Java 21 now when you scroll down a little you will see three sections for Linux Mac OS and windows we are going to click on the Mac version and then you will see uh different variants which you can download we are interested in downloading the DMG installer but here there are two variants of DMG installer also so if you are using M1 or M2 Mech then you need to select this one which is arm 64 DMG installer if you are using Intel backed Mac operating system then you need to choose the last uh one which is x64 DMG installer I am having the M2 Chip on my Mac operating system so I'm going to choose CH the second option which is arm 64 DMG installer so I'm going to click on this link which is for the download of this DMG file you can see the download of this G DMG file has been started so it's not going to take much time to download just wait for the download to complete and once the download is complete you can see this DMG file is downloaded so I can directly click on this DMG file here and let me minimize the browser and you will see this kind of window here in order to install Java jdk using this window you just need to click on this PKG file so I'm going to click on this PKG file which is going to start the installation process let me minimize this window also so this is the installer window we are going to just click on continue on the first window here and then it says this will take around 336 megabyte of space on your computer Compu I'm okay with it so I'm going to click on install here and then I need to give my macbook's password so I'm going to provide the password here and then click on install software which is going to start the installation of Java jdk on my Mac operating system and in few seconds this window will appear which says install succeed so now I can close this window so basic installation of java has been done when I press on close it says do you want to move jdk installer to bin yes because the Java installation is finished we can move this uh DMG file to the bin so I'm going to just click on that and that file will be moved to the bin now Java jdk is installed on my Mac operating system now the next step in this process is to set the Java home so for that what we we need to do we need to first of all find out where Java is installed on our Mac operating system so for that we are going to open the terminal so just click on this Spotlight icon and then search for terminal and then open the terminal from here so generally once you install Java jdk its location is for/ USR SL libexec slash Java home so Java uncore home and then you need to give hyphen and then capital V and it's going to give you the version of java which you have installed so this is the version which we have installed which is Java 20 1.0.1 once we know the version of uh Java so now in The Next Step what we need to do is we need to set or export the path of java home in our bash RC file or zshrc file now if you are using the newer version of Mac operating system most probably by default your Mac terminal is using zsh so we are going to set the Java home in the zshrc file now this zshrc file is located in your home folder so when you do p D and when you open the terminal for the first time this is the home folder of your Mac operating system or for your particular user right and this zshrc is located in this directory so how to uh know that you can do LS space hyphen Al and then press enter and you will be able to see this kind of file which says Dot zshrc now if this file is not present you don't need to worry about it we will create a new. zshrc file so if this file is present we will add our location to it if it's not present we will first create this file and then we are going to add our export now you can use any Editor to uh edit or create this file if this zshrc file is not there you can uh use this touch command and then write do zshrc and then press enter and it's going to create your do zshrc file in my case it's already present so I'm not going to give this command the next command is using a text editor you need to open this file you can use Nano to open the dot zsh file or if you are the fan of text editor then you can use open also so just write open and then write do zshrc which is the name of this file and then press enter which is going to open this zsh file using the text editor let me make this uh text a little bit bigger so you can see here so I already have one export here in your case if you have created this file for the first time you will not see any export here it will be blank what you need to do here is you need to copy and paste these two lines here I'm going to paste these two lines in the description of this video also so you can directly copy them and paste it into your terminal so the first command is export Java unor home is equal to dollar and then this is the path which we have uh seen in the terminal so we have used this path right user SL lib exact SL Java home space hyphen version and we got this version in my case right 21.0 point1 so here we have given the same path hyphen version and instead of this version you need to give the version which you see after giving this command so in my case the version is 2.0.1 so I'm going to replace this version with 21.0 point1 so let me just write 21. 0.1 here and then in the next line you need to uh give this command which is export space path is equal to Dollar Java home/ bin colon dollar path right so these two lines you need to copy and paste and don't forget to change the version with the version which you have once you are done you can save this file so I'm going to just uh click on the file option and then click on Save which is going to save this shrc file and then I'm going to close this once this is closed you can verify that your changes are saved by just giving the same command once again is openspace do zshrc and I can see that my changes are already there so I know that my changes are saved right once your changes are saved the next command you need to write here is this one so let me clear the terminal because uh it's full so after uh saving your export you just need to give this command which is source and then give the name of your file which is do zshrc and then press enter if you don't give this command then do zshrc will not load in the current terminal so if you don't give this command just close your terminal and then reopen the terminal once again okay so you can also do this so I'm going to just close this terminal and then quit from this terminal and then once again open the terminal and once the terminal is open I can check the Java home is set or Not by giving Echo command so I'm going to just give echo dollar Java uncore home and then press enter and it's going to give you the location of java home in my case it's uh Library SL Java SL Java virtual machine SL jdk 21. jdk contents for slome okay so if you have followed all the step which I have shown you you will see this kind of output now once uh Java home is set and Java is installed we can also check the version of java so you can give this command which is Java space hyphen version and then press enter and it's going to give you the version of java which is 2.0.1 in my case so Java is now successfully installed on my Mac operating system so now let's try to create a Java file where we will uh write a very simple hello world program and then we are going to compile it and then we are going to try to run that Java program so I'm going to clear the terminal and now you need to navigate to the folder where you want to uh create your Java project so right now I'm in my home directory you can uh just do LS here and here I have a few folders right so let's say I want to create a new Java project in the documents folder so I'm going to go or CD into my documents folder and then here let me create a folder called let's say I'm going to just create a folder using mkd command and then uh I will just name my uh folder as projects here and then press enter which is going to create this my project directory in the documents folder I can do LS once again and then you can see this my project directory is created so I'm going to go inside this directory CD and then the name of the directory and here I'm going to create a new Java file so in order to create a new Java file you can can uh use Touch command so just write touch and then the name of your Java file for example I'm going to create a file with the name hello and then the extension for this will be Java okay so just write touch space hello. Java which is going to create this hello. Java file in your my project directory so when I do LS you can see hello. Java file is created I can also go to my finder and then go to uh my uh documents folder where I have created this my projects folder where I can see that this hello. Java file is there so let me uh do this side by side so you will be able to see the output also in this Finder right so we have created this hello. Java file now uh you can open this hello.
