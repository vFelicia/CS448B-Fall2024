00:00 - hey guys what's going on welcome to
00:02 - programming knowledge and into this
00:04 - lecture we're going to talk about how to
00:06 - create user registration for using your
00:09 - PHP so this is a five video series and
00:14 - in this course we learn how to create
00:19 - this particular registration so we have
00:21 - the first name last name email address
00:23 - and phone number and of course the last
00:26 - one password so the technologist that
00:29 - we're going to use are the following PHP
00:33 - MySQL we're gonna use the bootstrap for
00:37 - the front end of our user registration
00:41 - form and of course we're gonna use the
00:43 - jQuery so let's go ahead and create our
00:46 - new project let us navigate to our
00:50 - localhost directory and create a new
01:00 - directory that will hold all the files
01:02 - necessary for our project so new folder
01:05 - and let's name it user accounts and then
01:12 - inside this particular folder we're
01:16 - going to define few files for our
01:19 - project so let's define the index dot
01:23 - PHP okay
01:28 - change extension yes and also let's
01:33 - define config dot PHP and also another
01:40 - one for our registration form so
01:45 - registration dot PHP so these files will
01:49 - be vital for our project config is for
01:53 - the configuration for our database
01:56 - connection the index dot PHP will be
01:59 - displaying all the users registered and
02:02 - of course again the registration that
02:06 - PHP where in which our form or user
02:09 - registration form will be displayed or
02:12 - located
02:13 - so now that we have the basic structure
02:14 - of our project let's go ahead and edit
02:17 - registration at the HP to create our
02:21 - user registration form okay so now open
02:26 - up the registration net by HP and we
02:29 - have an empty file so all we have to do
02:31 - is define the HTML structure for this
02:34 - one so HTML and if you're using sublime
02:39 - text you can just type in HTML and press
02:43 - tab in your keyboard okay so the title
02:47 - for this one is user registration in PHP
02:55 - so for now let's define our user
02:58 - registration form so we're just going to
03:02 - define a very basic a very basic user
03:05 - registration form and later on we'll
03:08 - improve the front-end by using the
03:13 - bootstrap library so let's start with a
03:18 - div and inside this div let's define the
03:21 - form and of course inside this form we
03:25 - could define a dip for our container and
03:29 - let's not forget to set the action for
03:32 - our form which is action and for now
03:36 - let's use the registration that page and
03:40 - method let's use post method so under
03:45 - the container div let's define h1 and it
03:51 - should say registration ok and a
03:58 - paragraph that says fill up fill up the
04:03 - form with correct values think after
04:10 - that one let's define an input with the
04:13 - input a keyword with the type tax and
04:18 - for the name let's make it or let's name
04:24 - it as
04:25 - name and of course let's define the
04:34 - label for this one so label label for
04:42 - first thing so it should be hold with
04:49 - the keyword first name of course this
04:57 - first name should be required after that
05:02 - we could just copy and paste this line
05:05 - so label for first name and input tax
05:09 - with a type or with the name first name
05:11 - so let's paste one for our last name for
05:17 - our email address for our phone number
05:20 - and for our password okay so let's
05:25 - change this into last name this to last
05:29 - name and of course the name should be
05:33 - last name also this one is for email
05:41 - address so email and email pretty name
05:51 - or for the name of the input and phone
05:57 - number phone number and also the label
06:06 - for the phone number lastly is the
06:12 - password so password and password
06:19 - pretty name and label for the password
06:24 - so let's change this input type into of
06:27 - course we're using the password and of
06:30 - course we're using email for this
06:33 - Phil for email address so if we're done
06:38 - with that let's check our registration
06:41 - that PHP file in our browser so go on
06:45 - with our browser and type in localhost
06:48 - and user account which is for our
06:56 - project name so user accounts and
07:01 - registration that PHP so we have here a
07:06 - very basic form or user registration
07:10 - form and we can see that we're missing a
07:13 - button for our submit so let's define it
07:16 - in our registration that PHP file so
07:20 - input and then pipe submit and for the
07:29 - name is say for example parade okay so
07:36 - the value for this one is sign up so
07:44 - save your file and let's go back to our
07:47 - browser and refresh our registration
07:51 - that PHP page so as you can see we have
07:56 - now the sign up button and the next step
07:59 - for this one is to actually implement
08:01 - PHP for this user creation or user
08:05 - registration form so let's go back to
08:08 - our code and above this then let's
08:15 - create a new div and let's open up our
08:21 - PHP tag inside this particular div and
08:26 - of course the first thing we're gonna
08:28 - need is to check if the users submitted
08:34 - the form all you have to do is type in
08:37 - the keyword estep and with the keyword
08:43 - post
08:45 - and of course we're gonna need the name
08:49 - of the name of our submit button which
08:52 - is scrape and open curly brace and
08:58 - closed curly brace so for now let's just
09:04 - check if the submit button is working
09:08 - let's ankle let's type in echo user
09:14 - submitted for us to check if the submit
09:19 - button is working so let's go back to
09:23 - our browser and refresh our page let us
09:27 - see if the signup button is working okay
09:34 - we forgot that we defined the first name
09:37 - was required also with this one also
09:39 - with this one and so on so for now let's
09:44 - define values for this first name last
09:47 - name sample values and password and for
09:53 - email address of course we need to set a
09:58 - valid email address and click on the
10:00 - signup button so as you can see users
10:04 - submitted is displayed meaning our
10:06 - signup button or signup submit button is
10:09 - working so in the next tutorial we will
10:13 - continue working with this PHP code and
10:16 - let's work on with our database
10:19 - connection thanks
10:29 - you

hey guys what's going on welcome to programming knowledge and into this lecture we're going to talk about how to create user registration for using your PHP so this is a five video series and in this
