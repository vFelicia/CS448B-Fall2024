00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install Debian on
00:05 - virtualbox on your Windows operating
00:07 - system
00:08 - so let's get started and let's see first
00:11 - of all how we can download the Debian
00:13 - ISO file and then we will see how we can
00:16 - use this that ISO file to install it on
00:19 - our virtualbox
00:21 - so first of all open your favorite
00:23 - browser and search for Debian and the
00:25 - first link which will appear here will
00:27 - be from debian.org so we are going to
00:29 - click on this link
00:31 - and let me just change the language to
00:33 - English here and here you will be able
00:36 - to see this operating system and the
00:40 - download button so I'm going to click on
00:41 - this download button and then you can
00:45 - see this link which is for Debian at the
00:48 - time of making this video 12.01 is the
00:52 - latest version so we are going to
00:53 - download this ISO file so I'm going to
00:55 - click on this
00:57 - link which is going to start the
00:59 - download of this ISO file now one more
01:02 - thing to note here is when you click on
01:05 - this getting started button you also
01:07 - have the option to install this complete
01:09 - installation image right now we have
01:11 - downloaded this 64-bit ISO file
01:15 - but it requires internet when you will
01:18 - try to install Debian if you download
01:21 - this image then it's a complete image
01:25 - but the size of this image will be
01:27 - bigger so it will take more time to
01:29 - download this file so we have downloaded
01:32 - this ISO file right so once the ISO file
01:36 - is downloaded it's going to look like
01:39 - this which is Debian 12.1.0 AMD 64 net
01:44 - inst dot ISO file so now we can use this
01:47 - file to install it using virtualbox so
01:50 - now let's go to our virtual box and
01:52 - let's create a new virtual machine here
01:54 - so I'm going to click on this new button
01:56 - so here I'm going to name my virtual
01:58 - machine for example
02:00 - Debian
02:02 - and it's going to recognize that we want
02:05 - to install the Debian operating system
02:08 - so you can see in the type it shows
02:11 - Linux and in the version it shows 64-bit
02:14 - if you don't see this option you can
02:16 - select this option from the drop down
02:19 - menu so select Debian 64 bit here
02:22 - also if you want to change the folder
02:25 - then you can change the folder of this
02:28 - virtual machine file so the default
02:31 - folder path is this one but if you want
02:35 - to change it I can just click on other
02:37 - and for example I want to change it to
02:40 - the same folder where my ISO file is
02:43 - present so I'm going to change the
02:46 - folder of the destination virtual
02:48 - machine and then I'm going to move
02:51 - forward so I'm going to click on next
02:52 - here
02:54 - on the next window you will see the
02:57 - hardware
02:58 - so you can move this
03:01 - bar up to the end of this green limit
03:05 - same you can do for the processor so I'm
03:07 - going to move the processor numbers up
03:12 - to the end of the green limit
03:15 - and then I can click on next button
03:18 - here in the virtual hard disk section
03:21 - you can allocate the hard disk size
03:24 - which you want to alligate to your
03:27 - virtual machine
03:29 - I generally move it up to let's say 100
03:32 - GB around 100 GB you can also change
03:36 - this value from here so I'm going to
03:37 - just write 100 here
03:39 - so I will not check this checkbox if you
03:43 - check this checkbox the 100 GB will be
03:46 - pre-allocated for your virtual machine
03:48 - which I don't want in my case right
03:51 - then I'm going to click on next here
03:54 - and this is the overview or summary of
03:56 - your machine which you will be creating
04:00 - when you click this finish button so if
04:03 - you are okay with this summary click on
04:05 - finish
04:06 - and once you click on finish you can see
04:08 - this Debian virtual machine is created
04:10 - on my virtualbox
04:13 - now if you want to change some settings
04:16 - you can select your virtual machine and
04:18 - then click on settings here so that's
04:20 - what we are going to do because we want
04:22 - to also add the ISO file to our virtual
04:25 - machine which we haven't done yet
04:28 - so here in the general section uh under
04:31 - Advanced what I do is I generally select
04:34 - shared clipboard and drag and drop as
04:37 - bi-directional this will allow you to
04:39 - copy and paste between your host machine
04:42 - which is Windows 11 in my case and your
04:45 - virtual machine which will be Debian so
04:47 - I can drag and drop files between host
04:50 - and virtual machine and also copy and
04:52 - paste between host and virtual machine
04:55 - in the system I have already
04:57 - selected the base memory and the
05:01 - processors you have the chance to change
05:04 - this also later once you have already
05:07 - created your virtual machine
05:09 - then I will move to the storage section
05:11 - where I will provide the path of my ISO
05:13 - file so here click on storage and then
05:16 - under controllers click on empty a disk
05:19 - icon here and then click on this disk
05:22 - icon and then click on choose file
05:24 - once you click on choose file just
05:27 - navigate to the location where your ISO
05:30 - file is present so my ISO file is
05:32 - present
05:33 - in this Debian folder so I'm going to
05:35 - just click on the ISO file or I'm going
05:39 - to select my ISO file from here and then
05:42 - click on open which is going to select
05:45 - my ISO file which I have downloaded
05:47 - right
05:48 - at this point I can click on OK here and
05:52 - once you have provided the path of your
05:54 - ISO file we can start the virtual
05:57 - machine so just select once again Debian
05:59 - and then click on start here so now here
06:02 - I can see the first window right and
06:06 - here you can select the graphical
06:09 - install then you have the option to
06:11 - install you have few other options so
06:14 - what we want to do is we want to choose
06:16 - the graphical install here so you can
06:18 - use your your up and down key in your
06:22 - keyboard to move to this graphical
06:25 - install and then press enter here once
06:28 - you select graphical install which is
06:30 - going to start the graphical
06:31 - installation of Debian
06:34 - so here on the first window of the
06:37 - installation of DB you can select the
06:39 - language I'm going to leave it as
06:41 - default which is English in my case if
06:44 - you want to change the language you can
06:45 - do it from here and then click on
06:47 - continue
06:48 - then select your location so from here
06:51 - you can select the location uh which is
06:54 - nearest to you so you have all these
06:58 - options here
06:59 - so let's say I'm going to select the US
07:03 - here and then click on continue
07:06 - and then you can also configure the
07:09 - keyboard so in different countries
07:10 - people use different uh keyboards for
07:13 - example I'm living in Germany and I have
07:16 - a German keyboard so I'm going to select
07:18 - this German language here in a similar
07:20 - way you can also choose the keyboard
07:23 - which you are using and then click on
07:26 - continue here
07:28 - and now you can see the load installer
07:31 - component from the installation media
07:34 - step is going on now on this next window
07:37 - you have this window which is called
07:39 - configure the network so here I have the
07:42 - host name Debian I will leave it as
07:43 - default and then click on continue
07:46 - and then you have the configure the
07:48 - network domain name I'm going to give
07:52 - the domain name for example code bind
07:55 - here you can provide any name here of
07:58 - your choice and then click on continue
08:03 - and then on the next window you can set
08:06 - the users and the password right so you
08:09 - have the password option which will be
08:12 - the root password and then you can
08:15 - retype your password so let me provide a
08:18 - very simple password to start with and
08:20 - then I'm going to retype that password
08:23 - and then click on continue now on the
08:27 - next page you can give the full name of
08:30 - the user in my case I'm going to give
08:32 - the name code bind here in your case you
08:36 - can give any name here of your choice
08:39 - right and then click on continue
08:42 - and then on the next window once again
08:45 - this name is present so I don't want to
08:47 - change anything here and then click on
08:50 - continue
08:51 - and then you have once again the chance
08:55 - to provide the password for this user
08:58 - which we have created which is code bind
09:01 - in my case so let me give the password
09:03 - to this user
09:06 - so we have provided the password for the
09:09 - root user and we have provided the
09:11 - password for the user which we have
09:13 - created in my case it's code bind right
09:16 - and then click on continue now on the
09:19 - next window based on the country and
09:21 - language you have selected in the
09:23 - previous steps you will see you have the
09:26 - option to select the time zone right I
09:30 - will leave it as default because I have
09:32 - chosen us that's why I see all these
09:36 - time zones here and then I'm going to
09:39 - click on continue here and now you have
09:41 - the next step which is partition disks
09:45 - so at this point I leave it as default
09:48 - and the default option here is guided
09:51 - use entire disk and then click on
09:53 - continue
09:55 - and at this point you just need to
09:57 - verify this space and then click on
10:00 - continue
10:01 - and once again I'm going to click on
10:03 - continue here
10:05 - and this will be the summary of your
10:08 - selection so once again I'm going to
10:10 - click on continue now on the next window
10:12 - you have this question which is write
10:14 - the changes to the disk I'm going to
10:16 - select this yes radio button and then
10:18 - click on continue and now the
10:20 - installation of the base system will
10:23 - start so just wait for few seconds until
10:26 - this installation is finished so here it
10:29 - says configure the package manager here
10:31 - I'm going to select no and then click on
10:34 - continue
10:36 - and then you have the option to
10:39 - configure the package manager right so
10:42 - you can choose the package manager of
10:44 - the country which is nearer from your
10:47 - location I'm going to just choose
10:49 - Germany from here and then click on
10:51 - continue
10:52 - and then you have the option to select
10:55 - the mirror so I will choose the default
10:59 - mirror which is
11:01 - dab.dabian.org but you can also choose
11:04 - other locations from here and then click
11:06 - on continue and on this next window I
11:09 - will leave it as blank and then click on
11:11 - continue and now at this point I will
11:13 - wait for few seconds once again now on
11:16 - the next window it asks me this question
11:19 - which is related to the participation so
11:23 - it asks participate in the package usage
11:26 - survey I don't want to do that so I will
11:28 - select no and then click on continue and
11:31 - now I have the option to select the
11:34 - software right
11:36 - so you have different uh
11:39 - graphical user interfaces you can select
11:43 - from so I will select the genome and
11:46 - Debian desktop environment here but if
11:49 - you like other environment you can
11:53 - choose from this list right so as I said
11:57 - I will leave it as default which is
11:58 - Debian desktop environment and genome if
12:01 - you want any other environment you can
12:04 - choose it from here and then click on
12:06 - continue now in between you will have
12:08 - the option to install the grub
12:10 - bootloader I will select yes and then
12:12 - click on continue
12:14 - and then you have enter device manually
12:17 - and you have this so I'm going to select
12:20 - the second option here and then click on
12:21 - continue so now at this point the
12:23 - installation is finished I can see this
12:25 - message finished the installation and
12:27 - then it says please choose continue to
12:30 - reboot so I'm going to click on continue
12:33 - which is going to reboot this Debian
12:36 - operating system you can see
12:39 - it's rebooting and now once the system
12:42 - is rebooted I don't need to do anything
12:44 - uh just wait for few seconds and after
12:49 - few seconds of wait I can see this
12:51 - window with my username which I have
12:54 - provided at the time of installation and
12:56 - let me provide the password which I have
12:59 - given at the time of installation and
13:01 - then I'm going to press enter which is
13:04 - going to log me inside my newly
13:07 - installed Debian operating system so now
13:10 - you can see I'm inside my Debian
13:12 - operating system and my operating system
13:15 - is running but there is one problem here
13:18 - and that is you can see when I resized
13:22 - the virtualbox window my Debian desktop
13:26 - size doesn't change according to the
13:29 - size of the window right so even though
13:31 - my Debian operating system is installed
13:36 - the window here I can see is still not
13:40 - resizing according to the size of my uh
13:44 - Windows operating system for example
13:46 - right so to solve this problem what we
13:49 - need to do is we need to run these two
13:51 - commands which is uh sudo apt update and
13:55 - sudo apt install
13:57 - dkms buildeth Essentials and Linux
14:00 - headers so I'm going to just open the
14:03 - terminal first of all so search for
14:06 - terminal here and then open your
14:08 - terminal and here you can give these
14:12 - commands so the first command is sudo
14:15 - apt
14:17 - update and then press enter give your
14:21 - debian's password so now first of all
14:24 - you will see this kind of error which
14:26 - says code bind is not a sudo's file
14:29 - right this is because uh we need to add
14:33 - code bind into the list of sudos or we
14:37 - need to provide all the Privileges to
14:39 - our new users which we have created
14:42 - right the root user have all the
14:44 - Privileges but we have logged into our
14:47 - operating system as the new user in my
14:50 - case it's code bind so to solve this
14:52 - just write s u space
14:56 - hyphen and then press enter and and then
14:59 - give your root password which you have
15:00 - provided at the time of installation so
15:03 - I'm going to provide that and then press
15:04 - enter and you can see now I am logged in
15:08 - as a root user right earlier I was
15:11 - logged in as a code bind user and now I
15:15 - have been logged in as a root user right
15:18 - here what we need to do is I need to
15:21 - give this command v i sudo and then
15:24 - press enter which is going to open this
15:27 - kind of file and here when you will
15:29 - scroll down a little
15:31 - you will see a list of
15:35 - all the Privileges to the root user you
15:38 - can see root user have all the
15:41 - Privileges here so here what I will do
15:43 - is I will just select this line right
15:45 - click and copy this line and on the next
15:48 - line I'm going to paste this so right
15:49 - click and paste the same line and you
15:52 - can see we are logged in as a code bind
15:55 - user right so we want to give the
15:57 - Privileges to code bind user in my case
16:00 - whatever you see here before at the red
16:03 - Debian you need to provide the same name
16:05 - instead of root on the next line so here
16:09 - I'm going to just give
16:11 - code bind here once you have given all
16:16 - the Privileges to the user you have
16:18 - created just press Ctrl o and then press
16:22 - enter and then control X to exit out
16:27 - to verify that your changes are saved
16:30 - once again give VI sudo command and once
16:33 - again go to the same location and if you
16:35 - see
16:36 - your new user have all the Privileges
16:39 - line then your changes are saved so
16:43 - press Ctrl X once again so now I'm going
16:46 - to exit out of this root user so now I'm
16:50 - logged in as this code bind user once
16:53 - again right and now I'm going to give
16:55 - the same command which is sudo apt
16:57 - update and then press enter and then
16:59 - give my debians password and then press
17:01 - enter and it's going to start the update
17:05 - this time and you can see everything is
17:07 - up to date now we are going to give the
17:10 - second command and once I have given
17:13 - that command I'm going to press enter
17:15 - here and wait for the installation
17:18 - so once this command is finished what I
17:22 - generally do is I generally type try to
17:25 - mount the
17:26 - virtualbox guest editions image using
17:29 - this devices option and see if that
17:32 - works so what I'm going to do is I'm
17:34 - going to click on devices here and then
17:37 - click on insert guest additions CD image
17:41 - and once I click on that option I go to
17:44 - activities and then search for files
17:48 - here so just search for files
17:51 - and you will see this is mounted so I'm
17:54 - going to click on this image and then
17:57 - click on run software and then click on
18:00 - run which is going to ask me for my
18:02 - password so I'm going to provide that
18:04 - and it's going to just install this
18:08 - virtualbox guest editions uh
18:12 - tool so once again wait for some time
18:15 - until this command is finished and once
18:18 - you see this kind of message that means
18:20 - the virtual box guest additions has been
18:23 - installed successfully so I'm going to
18:25 - just press enter here which is going to
18:27 - close this window and at this point I
18:30 - just need to restart my Debian operating
18:32 - system so just click on this top bar
18:36 - here and then click on this power icon
18:39 - here and then click on power off and
18:42 - then click on power off which is going
18:43 - to power off my Debian operating system
18:46 - and once that's finished I'm going to
18:49 - restart my Debian operating system once
18:52 - again so select Debian start it
18:55 - and now it's being started so just wait
18:58 - for some time until you see the login
19:00 - window
19:01 - and now I'm going to give my password
19:05 - and once I'm logged in and when I try to
19:07 - resize the Debian window you will see
19:10 - that it's going to resize according to
19:12 - the size of my desktop and that is what
19:16 - I wanted so now I can easily use this
19:20 - Debian operating system on my
19:23 - Windows host using virtualbox
19:27 - so that's how you can install Debian on
19:31 - virtualbox on your Windows operating
19:33 - system I hope you've enjoyed this video
19:35 - and I will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Debian on virtualbox on your Windows operating system so let's get started and let's see first of all how we can download the Debian ISO file and then we will see how we can use this that ISO file to install it on our virtualbox so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Debian and the first link which will appear here will be from debian.org so we are going to click on this link and let me just change the language to English here and here you will be able to see this operating system and the download button so I'm going to click on this download button and then you can see this link which is for Debian at the time of making this video 12.01 is the latest version so we are going to download this ISO file so I'm going to click on this link which is going to start the download of this ISO file now one more thing to note here is when you click on this getting started button you also have the option to install this complete installation image right now we have downloaded this 64bit ISO file but it requires internet when you will try to install Debian if you download this image then it's a complete image but the size of this image will be bigger so it will take more time to download this file so we have downloaded this ISO file right so once the ISO file is downloaded it's going to look like this which is Debian 12.1.0 AMD 64 net inst dot ISO file so now we can use this file to install it using virtualbox so now let's go to our virtual box and let's create a new virtual machine here so I'm going to click on this new button so here I'm going to name my virtual machine for example Debian and it's going to recognize that we want to install the Debian operating system so you can see in the type it shows Linux and in the version it shows 64bit if you don't see this option you can select this option from the drop down menu so select Debian 64 bit here also if you want to change the folder then you can change the folder of this virtual machine file so the default folder path is this one but if you want to change it I can just click on other and for example I want to change it to the same folder where my ISO file is present so I'm going to change the folder of the destination virtual machine and then I'm going to move forward so I'm going to click on next here on the next window you will see the hardware so you can move this bar up to the end of this green limit same you can do for the processor so I'm going to move the processor numbers up to the end of the green limit and then I can click on next button here in the virtual hard disk section you can allocate the hard disk size which you want to alligate to your virtual machine I generally move it up to let's say 100 GB around 100 GB you can also change this value from here so I'm going to just write 100 here so I will not check this checkbox if you check this checkbox the 100 GB will be preallocated for your virtual machine which I don't want in my case right then I'm going to click on next here and this is the overview or summary of your machine which you will be creating when you click this finish button so if you are okay with this summary click on finish and once you click on finish you can see this Debian virtual machine is created on my virtualbox now if you want to change some settings you can select your virtual machine and then click on settings here so that's what we are going to do because we want to also add the ISO file to our virtual machine which we haven't done yet so here in the general section uh under Advanced what I do is I generally select shared clipboard and drag and drop as bidirectional this will allow you to copy and paste between your host machine which is Windows 11 in my case and your virtual machine which will be Debian so I can drag and drop files between host and virtual machine and also copy and paste between host and virtual machine in the system I have already selected the base memory and the processors you have the chance to change this also later once you have already created your virtual machine then I will move to the storage section where I will provide the path of my ISO file so here click on storage and then under controllers click on empty a disk icon here and then click on this disk icon and then click on choose file once you click on choose file just navigate to the location where your ISO file is present so my ISO file is present in this Debian folder so I'm going to just click on the ISO file or I'm going to select my ISO file from here and then click on open which is going to select my ISO file which I have downloaded right at this point I can click on OK here and once you have provided the path of your ISO file we can start the virtual machine so just select once again Debian and then click on start here so now here I can see the first window right and here you can select the graphical install then you have the option to install you have few other options so what we want to do is we want to choose the graphical install here so you can use your your up and down key in your keyboard to move to this graphical install and then press enter here once you select graphical install which is going to start the graphical installation of Debian so here on the first window of the installation of DB you can select the language I'm going to leave it as default which is English in my case if you want to change the language you can do it from here and then click on continue then select your location so from here you can select the location uh which is nearest to you so you have all these options here so let's say I'm going to select the US here and then click on continue and then you can also configure the keyboard so in different countries people use different uh keyboards for example I'm living in Germany and I have a German keyboard so I'm going to select this German language here in a similar way you can also choose the keyboard which you are using and then click on continue here and now you can see the load installer component from the installation media step is going on now on this next window you have this window which is called configure the network so here I have the host name Debian I will leave it as default and then click on continue and then you have the configure the network domain name I'm going to give the domain name for example code bind here you can provide any name here of your choice and then click on continue and then on the next window you can set the users and the password right so you have the password option which will be the root password and then you can retype your password so let me provide a very simple password to start with and then I'm going to retype that password and then click on continue now on the next page you can give the full name of the user in my case I'm going to give the name code bind here in your case you can give any name here of your choice right and then click on continue and then on the next window once again this name is present so I don't want to change anything here and then click on continue and then you have once again the chance to provide the password for this user which we have created which is code bind in my case so let me give the password to this user so we have provided the password for the root user and we have provided the password for the user which we have created in my case it's code bind right and then click on continue now on the next window based on the country and language you have selected in the previous steps you will see you have the option to select the time zone right I will leave it as default because I have chosen us that's why I see all these time zones here and then I'm going to click on continue here and now you have the next step which is partition disks so at this point I leave it as default and the default option here is guided use entire disk and then click on continue and at this point you just need to verify this space and then click on continue and once again I'm going to click on continue here and this will be the summary of your selection so once again I'm going to click on continue now on the next window you have this question which is write the changes to the disk I'm going to select this yes radio button and then click on continue and now the installation of the base system will start so just wait for few seconds until this installation is finished so here it says configure the package manager here I'm going to select no and then click on continue and then you have the option to configure the package manager right so you can choose the package manager of the country which is nearer from your location I'm going to just choose Germany from here and then click on continue and then you have the option to select the mirror so I will choose the default mirror which is dab.dabian.org but you can also choose other locations from here and then click on continue and on this next window I will leave it as blank and then click on continue and now at this point I will wait for few seconds once again now on the next window it asks me this question which is related to the participation so it asks participate in the package usage survey I don't want to do that so I will select no and then click on continue and now I have the option to select the software right so you have different uh graphical user interfaces you can select from so I will select the genome and Debian desktop environment here but if you like other environment you can choose from this list right so as I said I will leave it as default which is Debian desktop environment and genome if you want any other environment you can choose it from here and then click on continue now in between you will have the option to install the grub bootloader I will select yes and then click on continue and then you have enter device manually and you have this so I'm going to select the second option here and then click on continue so now at this point the installation is finished I can see this message finished the installation and then it says please choose continue to reboot so I'm going to click on continue which is going to reboot this Debian operating system you can see it's rebooting and now once the system is rebooted I don't need to do anything uh just wait for few seconds and after few seconds of wait I can see this window with my username which I have provided at the time of installation and let me provide the password which I have given at the time of installation and then I'm going to press enter which is going to log me inside my newly installed Debian operating system so now you can see I'm inside my Debian operating system and my operating system is running but there is one problem here and that is you can see when I resized the virtualbox window my Debian desktop size doesn't change according to the size of the window right so even though my Debian operating system is installed the window here I can see is still not resizing according to the size of my uh Windows operating system for example right so to solve this problem what we need to do is we need to run these two commands which is uh sudo apt update and sudo apt install dkms buildeth Essentials and Linux headers so I'm going to just open the terminal first of all so search for terminal here and then open your terminal and here you can give these commands so the first command is sudo apt update and then press enter give your debian's password so now first of all you will see this kind of error which says code bind is not a sudo's file right this is because uh we need to add code bind into the list of sudos or we need to provide all the Privileges to our new users which we have created right the root user have all the Privileges but we have logged into our operating system as the new user in my case it's code bind so to solve this just write s u space hyphen and then press enter and and then give your root password which you have provided at the time of installation so I'm going to provide that and then press enter and you can see now I am logged in as a root user right earlier I was logged in as a code bind user and now I have been logged in as a root user right here what we need to do is I need to give this command v i sudo and then press enter which is going to open this kind of file and here when you will scroll down a little you will see a list of all the Privileges to the root user you can see root user have all the Privileges here so here what I will do is I will just select this line right click and copy this line and on the next line I'm going to paste this so right click and paste the same line and you can see we are logged in as a code bind user right so we want to give the Privileges to code bind user in my case whatever you see here before at the red Debian you need to provide the same name instead of root on the next line so here I'm going to just give code bind here once you have given all the Privileges to the user you have created just press Ctrl o and then press enter and then control X to exit out to verify that your changes are saved once again give VI sudo command and once again go to the same location and if you see your new user have all the Privileges line then your changes are saved so press Ctrl X once again so now I'm going to exit out of this root user so now I'm logged in as this code bind user once again right and now I'm going to give the same command which is sudo apt update and then press enter and then give my debians password and then press enter and it's going to start the update this time and you can see everything is up to date now we are going to give the second command and once I have given that command I'm going to press enter here and wait for the installation so once this command is finished what I generally do is I generally type try to mount the virtualbox guest editions image using this devices option and see if that works so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on devices here and then click on insert guest additions CD image and once I click on that option I go to activities and then search for files here so just search for files and you will see this is mounted so I'm going to click on this image and then click on run software and then click on run which is going to ask me for my password so I'm going to provide that and it's going to just install this virtualbox guest editions uh tool so once again wait for some time until this command is finished and once you see this kind of message that means the virtual box guest additions has been installed successfully so I'm going to just press enter here which is going to close this window and at this point I just need to restart my Debian operating system so just click on this top bar here and then click on this power icon here and then click on power off and then click on power off which is going to power off my Debian operating system and once that's finished I'm going to restart my Debian operating system once again so select Debian start it and now it's being started so just wait for some time until you see the login window and now I'm going to give my password and once I'm logged in and when I try to resize the Debian window you will see that it's going to resize according to the size of my desktop and that is what I wanted so now I can easily use this Debian operating system on my Windows host using virtualbox so that's how you can install Debian on virtualbox on your Windows operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
