00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can apply
00:07 - styles to our components using style
00:10 - sheets so if you remember in the last
00:13 - video we have created a project and when
00:16 - we create a project there is this line
00:19 - of code which is automatically generated
00:22 - for us which is right now interesting
00:25 - for us which is this one scene dot guest
00:28 - style dot ad and in the bracket get lost
00:31 - get resource and this application dot
00:35 - CSS is added so we have a CSS called
00:40 - application dot CSS so we will open it
00:43 - you can see in your application package
00:46 - there is a application dot CSS file
00:49 - which is right now empty now this file
00:52 - we can use to give styles right so let's
00:57 - see how we can give styles to our
01:01 - components inside our JavaFX using this
01:06 - CSS file now this works same as CSS
01:10 - files work so for example let's open our
01:14 - F XML file so I will open my F XML file
01:17 - and I have this button and a label here
01:20 - so using the ID of the button I can give
01:25 - the style to the button so this is the
01:27 - ID click me so this is the ID click me
01:30 - and I can just take this ID and with the
01:34 - hash and this ID I can give styles to
01:38 - this particular button which has this ID
01:40 - so for example I want to change the font
01:44 - size first of all so I will just give -
01:47 - FX - font and you have these options for
01:54 - style font size font family so you can
01:57 - choose right so for example I want font
02:00 - size right now and I will just give 20
02:04 - px okay and just give this semicolon
02:08 - let's give 30 PX for now okay
02:12 - now in the same way
02:13 - we can provide some background color for
02:16 - example FX - background color and we
02:25 - will use a method called RGB SOR G ba
02:29 - and then we can give these parameters
02:33 - here 255 255 255 and point eight zero
02:38 - right now for example I want to give the
02:40 - foreground color I can use FX - text
02:46 - fill so just use this option and for
02:51 - example I want the foreground color of
02:53 - blue something like this right now I
02:57 - want some padding and some border color
03:02 - also so what can I do here I can give
03:05 - the padding something like this FX -
03:09 - padding and then just give 6 6 6 6 -
03:14 - every side ok let us give a border
03:18 - radius so FX - border radius and let's
03:25 - give the border radius of 8 here okay
03:29 - now for example I want to change the
03:32 - weight of the font so I can just use FX
03:36 - - font weight which can be bold or
03:41 - italic or something else for example we
03:44 - use bold here ok and now just save your
03:48 - code and run your application and let's
03:51 - see how it looks like so you can see our
03:54 - button looks like this right nothing
03:57 - fancy but this is just the demonstration
03:59 - how you can change the styles of your
04:03 - button ok now similarly if you want to
04:06 - change the style of your label you can
04:09 - just use the ID of your label which is
04:13 - this one my message go to your
04:17 - application dot CSS and give hash and
04:20 - then your label ID and in the curly
04:24 - braces for example I will just
04:26 - - the same style here and paste it here
04:28 - and I will just save my code and run it
04:34 - and when I just click this button I can
04:39 - see this number random number generated
04:42 - in the label here right now for example
04:46 - you want to change the background color
04:48 - of your scene so what you can do here is
04:53 - you can just use dot root so just use
04:58 - dot root here and then give the styles
05:02 - to your root for example background
05:05 - color so just write FX - background
05:10 - color and for example I want to give the
05:13 - background color of grey right so just
05:17 - save it and then run your code and now
05:21 - the color of my scene becomes grey right
05:24 - now for example you have multiple
05:27 - buttons and you want to apply the same
05:30 - styles to all the buttons so instead of
05:33 - using this ID you can just use dot
05:38 - button and it will apply to all the
05:42 - buttons so something like this save your
05:45 - code and run it and it will be same so
05:48 - it will apply to all the button the same
05:51 - styles if you have multiple buttons
05:53 - something like four or five buttons the
05:56 - same styles will be applied to every
05:58 - button and similarly you can do for the
06:01 - labels so if you have multiple labels
06:03 - you can just use dot label and then
06:06 - apply the same styles to all the labels
06:10 - okay now let's open our F XML file using
06:15 - the scene builder so I will right click
06:16 - on my F XML file and open with scene
06:21 - builder and here you can see the style
06:26 - is not directly applied here so when we
06:30 - run our code we can see this style but
06:34 - this style sheet is not applied to this
06:38 - project and
06:39 - you can add a stylesheet to this scene
06:43 - builder you can just go to preview here
06:46 - and then choose this option called
06:49 - stylesheet and then add a stylesheet and
06:53 - then you can browse to your project so
06:56 - my project name is JavaFX
06:59 - test source application and choose your
07:03 - application dot CSS file from here and
07:06 - open it and now your style is be visible
07:10 - here right so you can just preview this
07:13 - style okay so in this way you can add
07:17 - this application or CSS or CSS styles in
07:21 - see in builder right now if you want to
07:24 - learn more about this styling and CSS
07:28 - file for JavaFX we have a reference so
07:31 - just open your browser and search for
07:34 - JavaFX CSS reference and the first link
07:37 - which will appear here will be from all
07:39 - article calm slash JavaFX slash the link
07:43 - to this JavaFX CSS reference guide so
07:47 - you can open this CSS reference guide
07:50 - and here is the documentation for the
07:54 - CSS you know styling right so for
07:59 - example i want some color for example
08:02 - this color so i can just copy it from
08:05 - here
08:06 - go to my style sheets and instead of
08:08 - blue i can just apply this color here
08:11 - right save it and run it and this color
08:15 - is applied here okay so this guide is
08:20 - really useful in you know finding out
08:23 - how you can tweak your CSS file and

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can apply styles to our components using style sheets so if you remember in the last video we have created a project and when we create a project there is this line of code which is automatically generated for us which is right now interesting for us which is this one scene dot guest style dot ad and in the bracket get lost get resource and this application dot CSS is added so we have a CSS called application dot CSS so we will open it you can see in your application package there is a application dot CSS file which is right now empty now this file we can use to give styles right so let's see how we can give styles to our components inside our JavaFX using this CSS file now this works same as CSS files work so for example let's open our F XML file so I will open my F XML file and I have this button and a label here so using the ID of the button I can give the style to the button so this is the ID click me so this is the ID click me and I can just take this ID and with the hash and this ID I can give styles to this particular button which has this ID so for example I want to change the font size first of all so I will just give FX font and you have these options for style font size font family so you can choose right so for example I want font size right now and I will just give 20 px okay and just give this semicolon let's give 30 PX for now okay now in the same way we can provide some background color for example FX background color and we will use a method called RGB SOR G ba and then we can give these parameters here 255 255 255 and point eight zero right now for example I want to give the foreground color I can use FX text fill so just use this option and for example I want the foreground color of blue something like this right now I want some padding and some border color also so what can I do here I can give the padding something like this FX padding and then just give 6 6 6 6 every side ok let us give a border radius so FX border radius and let's give the border radius of 8 here okay now for example I want to change the weight of the font so I can just use FX font weight which can be bold or italic or something else for example we use bold here ok and now just save your code and run your application and let's see how it looks like so you can see our button looks like this right nothing fancy but this is just the demonstration how you can change the styles of your button ok now similarly if you want to change the style of your label you can just use the ID of your label which is this one my message go to your application dot CSS and give hash and then your label ID and in the curly braces for example I will just the same style here and paste it here and I will just save my code and run it and when I just click this button I can see this number random number generated in the label here right now for example you want to change the background color of your scene so what you can do here is you can just use dot root so just use dot root here and then give the styles to your root for example background color so just write FX background color and for example I want to give the background color of grey right so just save it and then run your code and now the color of my scene becomes grey right now for example you have multiple buttons and you want to apply the same styles to all the buttons so instead of using this ID you can just use dot button and it will apply to all the buttons so something like this save your code and run it and it will be same so it will apply to all the button the same styles if you have multiple buttons something like four or five buttons the same styles will be applied to every button and similarly you can do for the labels so if you have multiple labels you can just use dot label and then apply the same styles to all the labels okay now let's open our F XML file using the scene builder so I will right click on my F XML file and open with scene builder and here you can see the style is not directly applied here so when we run our code we can see this style but this style sheet is not applied to this project and you can add a stylesheet to this scene builder you can just go to preview here and then choose this option called stylesheet and then add a stylesheet and then you can browse to your project so my project name is JavaFX test source application and choose your application dot CSS file from here and open it and now your style is be visible here right so you can just preview this style okay so in this way you can add this application or CSS or CSS styles in see in builder right now if you want to learn more about this styling and CSS file for JavaFX we have a reference so just open your browser and search for JavaFX CSS reference and the first link which will appear here will be from all article calm slash JavaFX slash the link to this
