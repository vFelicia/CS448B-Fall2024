00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you what is a pointer and how we
00:06 - can use pointer in
00:08 - C++ so first of all let's see what is a
00:12 - pointer a pointer is a variable whose
00:16 - value is the address of another
00:20 - variable so let me just uh paste the
00:24 - definition and then we will look what is
00:27 - a pointer I will explain you
00:30 - so once again what is a pointer a
00:33 - pointer is a variable whose value is the
00:37 - address of another variable right now
00:41 - for
00:43 - example you I think you might know that
00:46 - whenever you declare a
00:49 - variable its value is stored in the
00:52 - memory somewhere right so whenever you
00:57 - declare V is equal to Zer for example
01:00 - example how you can show the address of
01:03 - the variable where this variable is
01:06 - stored so you can show it
01:11 - by just writing this end sign before
01:14 - your variable and then you will be able
01:18 - to see the address of the
01:20 - variable so once
01:23 - again
01:25 - let's build our program and when I run
01:29 - this program
01:30 - you you see this hexad decimal number
01:33 - this
01:34 - indicates the memory address where there
01:39 - this variable is stored okay so this
01:43 - indicates the memory address of this
01:46 - variable now the pointer when it comes
01:49 - to
01:50 - pointer pointer indicates or pointer is
01:55 - a variable so you declare a
01:58 - variable whose value is the memory
02:01 - address of the other variable right so
02:06 - this is the memory address so basically
02:10 - when you declare a pointer it
02:13 - will its value will be the memory
02:16 - address of other variable and why we do
02:19 - it because whenever you assign some
02:23 - value
02:25 - to uh
02:27 - variable it's or and once again you
02:31 - assign it to some other
02:34 - variable its value is not fixed for
02:37 - example whenever uh right now I have
02:42 - variable here V is equal to zero and you
02:46 - can assign V is equal to 20 also right
02:52 - but whenever you assign this to this
02:58 - here the address will remain the same
03:01 - but the value will change right
03:05 - so the pointer enables us to point the
03:10 - memory address and whatever the value of
03:13 - value stored in that memory address will
03:16 - be indicated or when will be pointed by
03:20 - the pointer right so let me give you an
03:23 - example how you can define a pointer you
03:26 - can define a pointer with this
03:31 - estx or star sign and then you can give
03:35 - the name of the
03:38 - variable so for example I want to
03:41 - declare uh integer pointer so I will
03:44 - write int then this estx and then I will
03:50 - give the name for example
03:53 - int P for indicating in pointer okay now
04:01 - when I assign some value to this pointer
04:05 - so we always assign a value to the
04:09 - pointer which is the address of other
04:12 - variabl so what we can do is we can
04:14 - write in P is equal to the address of
04:20 - this variable and how we achieve or how
04:23 - we have U accessed the address of this
04:27 - variable by using and sign before your
04:31 - variable just copy it and paste it here
04:35 - so our pointer definition is true now
04:39 - right pointer is a variable whose value
04:41 - is the address so this shows the address
04:45 - of another variable right now when when
04:49 - you print this INTP pointer what will it
04:54 - show it will show the address
04:58 - of
05:00 - the variable right this variable so
05:04 - first of all let's print it like this
05:09 - and I will copy this and paste it here
05:12 - and when I just compile this program and
05:15 - run it you can see here the first
05:18 - address and second address are same
05:21 - right
05:22 - so what we have done is we have assigned
05:25 - the address of this variable to this
05:28 - pointer and that's what the pointer does
05:33 - it stores the address of another
05:36 - variable right now if you want to access
05:40 - the value of the
05:42 - variable for example you want to access
05:45 - the value of this variable using this
05:47 - pointer so the Val value of this
05:50 - variable is 20 let's make get 100 for
05:54 - example right and for example you want
05:57 - to access this value using this pointer
06:01 - how you can do it you can just
06:04 - write the same definition of pointer
06:08 - estx this estx and then int P once again
06:13 - right and then when you compile your
06:18 - program this estx and this INTP pointer
06:24 - will show the value of this variable or
06:28 - value which which is stored at this
06:32 - address right so let's see it's 100
06:36 - right now okay so this is showing the
06:39 - value
06:41 - of this
06:45 - address now let's try to change the
06:48 - value of this variable VAR let's give it
06:51 - a value for example VAR is equal to
06:56 - 20 once again V is equal to
07:01 - 20 and once again try to
07:04 - print the value of this pointer and the
07:09 - address of this
07:11 - pointer once again I just copied and
07:13 - pasted the same line from above right
07:17 - and when I compile this program and run
07:19 - this program you will see here the
07:22 - address always Remains the Same that
07:26 - means the point is accessing the value
07:31 - from this address but the value stored
07:35 - at this address is changed when we
07:39 - assign some value to variable so that
07:44 - means address of a variable always
07:47 - remains same but you can change the
07:50 - value stored on this particular
07:54 - address so I think uh this is the basics
07:58 - of pointer in C++ there are much and
08:02 - more about pointers and you need to read
08:05 - it uh in details but this is the basics
08:09 - of pointer and and I hope you have
08:11 - understood the concept behind pointer
08:14 - and I hope you have enjoyed this video
08:15 - please rate comment and subscribe and
08:17 - bye for now

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you what is a pointer and how we can use pointer in C++ so first of all let's see what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable so let me just uh paste the definition and then we will look what is a pointer I will explain you so once again what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable right now for example you I think you might know that whenever you declare a variable its value is stored in the memory somewhere right so whenever you declare V is equal to Zer for example example how you can show the address of the variable where this variable is stored so you can show it by just writing this end sign before your variable and then you will be able to see the address of the variable so once again let's build our program and when I run this program you you see this hexad decimal number this indicates the memory address where there this variable is stored okay so this indicates the memory address of this variable now the pointer when it comes to pointer pointer indicates or pointer is a variable so you declare a variable whose value is the memory address of the other variable right so this is the memory address so basically when you declare a pointer it will its value will be the memory address of other variable and why we do it because whenever you assign some value to uh variable it's or and once again you assign it to some other variable its value is not fixed for example whenever uh right now I have variable here V is equal to zero and you can assign V is equal to 20 also right but whenever you assign this to this here the address will remain the same but the value will change right so the pointer enables us to point the memory address and whatever the value of value stored in that memory address will be indicated or when will be pointed by the pointer right so let me give you an example how you can define a pointer you can define a pointer with this estx or star sign and then you can give the name of the variable so for example I want to declare uh integer pointer so I will write int then this estx and then I will give the name for example int P for indicating in pointer okay now when I assign some value to this pointer so we always assign a value to the pointer which is the address of other variabl so what we can do is we can write in P is equal to the address of this variable and how we achieve or how we have U accessed the address of this variable by using and sign before your variable just copy it and paste it here so our pointer definition is true now right pointer is a variable whose value is the address so this shows the address of another variable right now when when you print this INTP pointer what will it show it will show the address of the variable right this variable so first of all let's print it like this and I will copy this and paste it here and when I just compile this program and run it you can see here the first address and second address are same right so what we have done is we have assigned the address of this variable to this pointer and that's what the pointer does it stores the address of another variable right now if you want to access the value of the variable for example you want to access the value of this variable using this pointer so the Val value of this variable is 20 let's make get 100 for example right and for example you want to access this value using this pointer how you can do it you can just write the same definition of pointer estx this estx and then int P once again right and then when you compile your program this estx and this INTP pointer will show the value of this variable or value which which is stored at this address right so let's see it's 100 right now okay so this is showing the value of this address now let's try to change the value of this variable VAR let's give it a value for example VAR is equal to 20 once again V is equal to 20 and once again try to print the value of this pointer and the address of this pointer once again I just copied and pasted the same line from above right and when I compile this program and run this program you will see here the address always Remains the Same that means the point is accessing the value from this address but the value stored at this address is changed when we assign some value to variable so that means address of a variable always remains same but you can change the value stored on this particular address so I think uh this is the basics of pointer in C++ there are much and more about pointers and you need to read it uh in details but this is the basics of pointer and and I hope you have understood the concept behind pointer and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
