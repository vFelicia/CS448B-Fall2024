00:08 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:10 - video I will show you how to link your
00:14 - WPF cop application with site
00:19 - database in the pre previous video
00:22 - tutorials which I made for Windows Form
00:24 - application in cop I used mySQL database
00:29 - and in in this uh video series of wpfc
00:33 - shop I want to use sqi database so you
00:37 - will be having the idea of both
00:40 - databases so why we are going to use
00:44 - escolite we are going to use escal
00:47 - because it's a serverless database so
00:50 - whatever application you are going to
00:53 - make with the help of esite database it
00:57 - will be a
00:58 - standalone applic application so it
01:00 - doesn't need any server for its uh uh
01:04 - its functioning that's the biggest
01:07 - advantage of using escal
01:10 - database so you can transfer your
01:13 - application from one computer to another
01:15 - without worrying or without worrying for
01:18 - deployment of the server and all so
01:22 - that's about escolite if you want to
01:25 - learn more about escolite I have made a
01:28 - video tutorials
01:30 - some weeks ago uh which is called
01:33 - beginners escal tutorial and you can go
01:38 - to my Channel programming knowledge and
01:40 - in the playlist you will find this
01:43 - beginners escal tutorial so you will be
01:47 - having some idea how this escal work and
01:50 - how the queries are
01:52 - passed
01:55 - now when you want to deploy site on this
02:00 - WPF
02:01 - application
02:03 - the visual studio doesn't have any uh
02:08 - tool for directly
02:10 - connecting this WPF with
02:14 - your skite so we need to download some
02:20 - third-party
02:21 - dlls which will uh help us to connect it
02:25 - with our application so it will be a
02:28 - open-source uh
02:31 - uh dll files and it will be free for to
02:35 - download so you don't have to worry
02:38 - about uh the cost and all so we are
02:42 - going to download this for free so go to
02:46 - your search Google search and write

05:45 - resources and it will open this dialogue
05:48 - box go to browse here browse and we will
05:53 - search for our DL file so go to your
05:57 - project and Bin in debug folder we have
06:01 - all these three
06:04 - DLS what dll we need is this escolite do
06:10 - net. dll so select this escal light.
06:13 - net. dll and click
06:19 - okay and when you see here in the
06:24 - resources folder of your
06:28 - project the s site.net dll is added
06:32 - here okay now we need to check whether
06:38 - this
06:39 - uh site file or sq DL work or not so
06:44 - what I will do
06:46 - is I will use this button to check
06:49 - whether my uh site connection works or
06:53 - not so I will double click
06:56 - it and what I will do is I will
07:00 - go to this website once again which is
07:04 - fin finisher
07:06 - dosq ado.net
07:09 - does. Source Forge from where I have
07:13 - downloaded
07:15 - these esite or uh dll files for esite go
07:21 - here and click this document and
07:25 - examples and
07:27 - then go here in the code example below
07:33 - here and it will open an example so they
07:38 - have provided an example how to work
07:41 - with
07:43 - escolite using C code so just copy this
07:47 - code we are going to use this code in
07:50 - our application just to check and then I
07:54 - will uh show you how to use it correctly
07:58 - so first
08:00 - just copy this using finisher doite this
08:03 - first line and go to your
08:06 - project code section and here where all
08:11 - the using name spaces are there just add
08:14 - this finish using finish. escolite here
08:19 - okay now once this is done now once
08:23 - again we will go to
08:25 - our form section or main window section
08:30 - so I will just double click it once
08:32 - again and I have written this message do
08:36 - Dosh show code earliest which I'm going
08:38 - to comment and in here I
08:42 - will I will copy the code which
08:47 - this site has provided which is this
08:51 - finish. sqlite example site so I will
08:54 - just copy this all code below this using
08:58 - finish. skent all the code from
09:02 - here to the
09:05 - bottom and just go here in your button
09:09 - click event and I will paste it
09:12 - here so it will work without any
09:16 - error if you have provided this using
09:20 - name
09:21 - spaces
09:23 - now I need to change something in this
09:28 - code
09:30 - because it's giving me output in this
09:34 - console and I want the output in the
09:36 - message box so I will change a little
09:40 - bit this uh code so in your code just go
09:45 - wherever your while loop is there in
09:49 - that code there is a while loop where
09:52 - you have this while loop argument
09:55 - escolite uncore datar reader. read and
09:59 - in here they have provided this
10:02 - code so instead of this code I will
10:05 - comment this
10:06 - code here and I
10:10 - will declare a string
10:18 - variable
