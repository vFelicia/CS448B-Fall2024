00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to make a
00:04 - simple calculator with the help of your
00:07 - visual Bas basic Windows Form
00:10 - application so let's get
00:12 - started first of all I will take uh two
00:17 - labels from the
00:20 - tool box and then I will take two text
00:26 - boxes from the toolbox
00:31 - and I will take a
00:36 - button okay so now I have all the things
00:40 - let me change the font of all
00:44 - the all the labels first of all a label
00:49 - name I will change so first label name
00:52 - is num one label number one and the text
00:58 - is
01:02 - number
01:03 - one okay and the font
01:10 - is font will be a little bit bigger so
01:15 - let's
01:21 - see bold and 16
01:25 - okay and same for the text box for the
01:29 - text box font will be a little bit
01:35 - bigger bold 16 label two font will be
01:40 - bit
01:43 - bigger and for the text box
01:47 - also bigger
01:49 - font and for the button
01:54 - also and let's change the text of this
01:57 - label this is
02:02 - number
02:05 - two and this button is the results so
02:11 - button text
02:15 - is result
02:17 - okay so now I have number one and number
02:20 - two so whenever I enter number one and
02:23 - number two and click this result with
02:26 - button it should show me the result of
02:30 - for example sum or addition or whatever
02:33 - now I will just click this result button
02:37 - and double click it and in here I will
02:40 - write uh code first of all I will
02:43 - declare some Global variabl so I will
02:47 - write
02:52 - dim number
02:54 - one
02:58 - as uh these are
03:03 - integer is equal
03:05 - to first of all I will
03:08 - uh not give
03:11 - any value to the integer so in the same
03:15 - way I will declare number two
03:20 - variable H in the same way copy and
03:23 - paste I will
03:25 - declare a variable integer for
03:32 - answer okay once this is
03:35 - done and then in the button click event
03:38 - in this button click event I will uh
03:41 - write the
03:43 - code number
03:45 - one is equal to whatever we enter in the
03:48 - text box one so textbox one
03:52 - dot text in the same way for number
03:58 - two number two variable that means this
04:02 - variable is equal to textbox 2 so these
04:05 - text box one and textbox two are the
04:07 - names of these text boxes you see here
04:10 - text box one and text box two right so
04:14 - this is this and answer
04:18 - is answer is equal
04:21 - to
04:25 - number number one plus
04:30 - number two okay and then we will
04:36 - simply transfer this to the answer label
04:41 - or message box so let's give the answer
04:44 - in message box so I'll
04:46 - write message
04:49 - box dot
04:55 - show and inside this message I will pass
04:59 - the
05:01 - answer okay so this is
05:06 - done now this um program
05:12 - will add these two numbers and show in
05:15 - the message box so let's try and run the
05:19 - program for example I enter a first
05:22 - number as 20 and second number as 40 and
05:26 - I will click this result and it shows me
05:29 - 6
05:31 - or 45 it shows me
05:35 - 65 but for example when you want to
05:38 - enter some integer for example
05:43 - 2.34 plus 2 55 it will still show me the
05:50 - integer value not the decimal value so
05:54 - for that if you want to show these Valu
05:56 - as a decimal instead of here in instead
05:59 - of declaring these number as integer you
06:02 - just change it as
06:05 - single
06:07 - okay and change all these values as
06:10 - single and then run the program once
06:14 - again
06:18 - 2.12 +
06:22 - 4.25 and now it shows me the result but
06:26 - in the message box you need to
06:31 - is showing the correct value but what
06:33 - I'm doing here is for you see here when
06:36 - you give
06:39 - two 22 or as and for second integer as
06:44 - 2.3 three or whatever it will give me
06:48 - this type of integer but when you enter
06:52 - two comma this is considered as Point
06:56 - here and this also is considered as
07:00 - point and then you see here it's showing
07:05 - the correct result 6.44 now so just
07:10 - remember this uh while you are making
07:13 - the
07:14 - calculator now for example you want to
07:17 - subtract number two from number one just
07:21 - just add here the subtract sign and then
07:26 - run your program and for example I want
07:29 - to
07:30 - subtract 5 from 20 the result is 15 now
07:35 - for example you want to divide just give
07:40 - this divide
07:44 - sign and now run the
07:48 - program and first number is 20 second is
07:52 - five result will be four okay it's
07:55 - working and for multiplication just give
07:58 - this estx here and run the program and
08:03 - 20 multiplied by 5 will be 100 okay so
08:09 - in this way you can
08:12 - um perform mathematical Expressions on
08:16 - mathematical calculation using Visual
08:18 - Basic I hope you have enjoyed this video

08:23 - bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to make a simple calculator with the help of your visual Bas basic Windows Form application so let's get started first of all I will take uh two labels from the tool box and then I will take two text boxes from the toolbox and I will take a button okay so now I have all the things let me change the font of all the all the labels first of all a label name I will change so first label name is num one label number one and the text is number one okay and the font is font will be a little bit bigger so let's see bold and 16 okay and same for the text box for the text box font will be a little bit bigger bold 16 label two font will be bit bigger and for the text box also bigger font and for the button also and let's change the text of this label this is number two and this button is the results so button text is result okay so now I have number one and number two so whenever I enter number one and number two and click this result with button it should show me the result of for example sum or addition or whatever now I will just click this result button and double click it and in here I will write uh code first of all I will declare some Global variabl so I will write dim number one as uh these are integer is equal to first of all I will uh not give any value to the integer so in the same way I will declare number two variable H in the same way copy and paste I will declare a variable integer for answer okay once this is done and then in the button click event in this button click event I will uh write the code number one is equal to whatever we enter in the text box one so textbox one dot text in the same way for number two number two variable that means this variable is equal to textbox 2 so these text box one and textbox two are the names of these text boxes you see here text box one and text box two right so this is this and answer is answer is equal to number number one plus number two okay and then we will simply transfer this to the answer label or message box so let's give the answer in message box so I'll write message box dot show and inside this message I will pass the answer okay so this is done now this um program will add these two numbers and show in the message box so let's try and run the program for example I enter a first number as 20 and second number as 40 and I will click this result and it shows me 6 or 45 it shows me 65 but for example when you want to enter some integer for example 2.34 plus 2 55 it will still show me the integer value not the decimal value so for that if you want to show these Valu as a decimal instead of here in instead of declaring these number as integer you just change it as single okay and change all these values as single and then run the program once again 2.12 + 4.25 and now it shows me the result but in the message box you need to is showing the correct value but what I'm doing here is for you see here when you give two 22 or as and for second integer as 2.3 three or whatever it will give me this type of integer but when you enter two comma this is considered as Point here and this also is considered as point and then you see here it's showing the correct result 6.44 now so just remember this uh while you are making the calculator now for example you want to subtract number two from number one just just add here the subtract sign and then run your program and for example I want to subtract 5 from 20 the result is 15 now for example you want to divide just give this divide sign and now run the program and first number is 20 second is five result will be four okay it's working and for multiplication just give this estx here and run the program and 20 multiplied by 5 will be 100 okay so in this way you can um perform mathematical Expressions on mathematical calculation using Visual Basic I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
