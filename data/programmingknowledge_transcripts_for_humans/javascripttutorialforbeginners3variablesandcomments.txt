00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:05 - this video we will learn about comments
00:07 - and variables in JavaScript so let's get
00:10 - started with comments you can give
00:13 - commments in JavaScript in two ways one
00:16 - is a single line comment and you can
00:20 - give a single line comment by giving two
00:22 - forward slashes and then your command
00:25 - for example my code okay so this is how
00:29 - you can give a single line comment and
00:32 - whatever you write after these two
00:35 - double forward slashes will not be
00:38 - executed by your JavaScript code or you
00:42 - can give a comment by giving these
00:45 - forward slash and then estx and then
00:49 - estx and forward slash okay and whatever
00:52 - comment you will uh give in between this
00:57 - forward slash and estx and estx and
01:00 - forward slash it will be considered as a
01:02 - comment so if you want to give a
01:04 - multi-line comment you can give
01:06 - something like this okay so this is how
01:10 - you can use comments in JavaScript now
01:14 - let's talk about variable so first of
01:17 - all what is a variable a variable is a
01:20 - container which can contain some data so
01:24 - for example we can assign a variable or
01:28 - we can name a variable like X and then
01:31 - we can assign some data for example one
01:34 - into it right so X is a variable which
01:39 - contains the value of
01:42 - one now in JavaScript to declare a
01:45 - variables there are some rules okay so
01:49 - there are mainly uh I think three or
01:52 - four rules you need to remember whenever
01:55 - declaring the variable first rule is you
01:59 - can can declare a variable using
02:03 - numbers letters a dollar symbol or an
02:08 - underscore okay so you can uh declare a
02:12 - variable something like my variable or
02:17 - my variable something like this okay
02:21 - your variable name can also start with a
02:24 - dollar symbol so for example dollar my
02:27 - variable or you can also start your
02:31 - variable Name by underscore like this my
02:35 - variable okay you can also declare a
02:38 - variable using a number after a letter
02:42 - or a keyword for example you want to
02:45 - declare X1 you can declare a variable
02:49 - but a variable cannot start with a
02:52 - number so this is not valid okay so X1
02:57 - is valid but one X is not valid because
03:01 - your variable cannot start with a number
03:05 - the next rule is your variable cannot
03:08 - contain the reserved keywords in
03:12 - JavaScript so there are a number of
03:14 - keyword which are reserved in JavaScript
03:18 - and with this course when we learn more
03:20 - we will learn more about these keyword
03:23 - for example there is a keyword called
03:25 - VAR or there is a keyword called
03:28 - function these are reserved keywords and
03:31 - you cannot declare a variable using
03:35 - these keywords okay now I will show you
03:39 - some more interesting stuff so if you
03:42 - have a Google Chrome browser just open
03:45 - your Google Chrome browser and then
03:48 - right click on it and then go to the
03:51 - last option which says inspect element
03:55 - okay and this is the thing which will
03:57 - help you to debug and find the errors
04:00 - into your JavaScript code so for example
04:04 - go to console here and in here for
04:08 - example I will declare a variable called
04:11 - X is equal to 1 and press enter and it
04:17 - will give you the result one something
04:20 - like this I will make it a little bit
04:22 - bigger so it will give you the result
04:24 - one right or for example you can give a
04:30 - variable called Y is equal to 5 and it
04:33 - will give you the result five now you
04:35 - have two variables X and Y which you can
04:38 - use in your console here so for example
04:42 - X + Y when you enter it will give you
04:47 - six because X is equal to 1 and Y is
04:50 - equal to 5 and when you add these two it
04:53 - will give you six right now I have told
04:56 - you that a variable cannot start with a
05:00 - number so let's check here if this
05:03 - variable when we declared with a number
05:07 - will it pass or not so one my well for
05:12 - example okay which start with a number
05:14 - and press enter and it will give you
05:17 - this error which says uncut syntax error
05:21 - right so this is not allowed but when we
05:24 - declare a variable something like my
05:28 - well and and assign some value in here
05:33 - then it's not going to give you the
05:35 - error now let's try to uh declare a
05:39 - variable with underscore for example
05:42 - underscore my well is equal to 1 and
05:46 - press enter and it's totally valid and
05:50 - now let's try to declare a variable with
05:52 - a dollar symbol so dollar and my well
05:58 - and this is equal to 6 for example and
06:01 - it's also totally valid okay so this
06:04 - console will help you to debug your code
06:08 - and even show you if you have some
06:10 - errors in your code right now let's see
06:16 - how these variable Works in JavaScript
06:20 - so for example you declare a variable
06:23 - called X is equal to 6 and Y is equal to
06:29 - 10 okay so I have already told you that
06:33 - you can do something like x + y and it
06:37 - will give you the sum and whenever you
06:40 - will do X or
06:42 - Yus X then it will give you the
06:46 - substraction you can do the opposite x -
06:49 - Y and it will give you the minus value
06:51 - right now to multiply these two numbers
06:54 - you can do y multiplied by X so estx is
06:59 - the multiplication symbol in JavaScript
07:02 - so press enter and it will give you the
07:05 - multiplication whenever you do for
07:07 - example y ided x so y ided x is 1.6
07:14 - whatever is the value of uh this
07:17 - division it will give you now there is a
07:20 - special uh symbol called mod in
07:23 - JavaScript so whenever you do y mod x
07:29 - and press enter then it will give you
07:32 - the remainder of the division of the
07:37 - variable you are dividing so the value
07:39 - of y was 10 and the value of x was 6 so
07:44 - when you divide y by X then you would
07:48 - get four as remainder so this modulus
07:52 - gives you the remainder now JavaScript
07:55 - is also intelligent enough to recognize
07:58 - what operation you want to do with your
08:01 - numbers for example you want to do 4 - 4
08:07 - multiplied by 5 it will give you - 16
08:11 - and not zero right so it will give the
08:14 - importance to the multiplication first
08:16 - and then the subtraction or for example
08:20 - you want to divide and multiply and add
08:24 - or subtract something at the same time
08:27 - it will give the Precedence something
08:29 - like multiplication then division then
08:31 - addition and then the subtraction okay
08:35 - or if you want to make your code more
08:37 - clear you can do something like this so
08:40 - you can add a bracket here and inside
08:43 - this bracket you can do 4 minus 4 and
08:46 - then after the bracket you can do
08:48 - multiply it by five and press enter it
08:52 - will give you 0o because this bracket
08:54 - has more priority than your
08:57 - multiplication or your division
09:00 - symbols okay so in this way you can use
09:04 - uh these variables and commands in
09:06 - JavaScript by the way if you are using
09:09 - Firefox you can also use this consoles
09:12 - so go to Firefox and right click and
09:14 - once again go to inspect element and in
09:18 - here go to console and you have this
09:21 - console here x is equal to one and it
09:24 - will give you the same answer okay so if
09:28 - you have a Firefox for Google Chrome you
09:31 - can debug your code and find errors in
09:34 - it and do many more things with this uh
09:38 - view here so I hope you have enjoyed
09:40 - this video please rate comment subscribe
09:42 - and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about comments and variables in JavaScript so let's get started with comments you can give commments in JavaScript in two ways one is a single line comment and you can give a single line comment by giving two forward slashes and then your command for example my code okay so this is how you can give a single line comment and whatever you write after these two double forward slashes will not be executed by your JavaScript code or you can give a comment by giving these forward slash and then estx and then estx and forward slash okay and whatever comment you will uh give in between this forward slash and estx and estx and forward slash it will be considered as a comment so if you want to give a multiline comment you can give something like this okay so this is how you can use comments in JavaScript now let's talk about variable so first of all what is a variable a variable is a container which can contain some data so for example we can assign a variable or we can name a variable like X and then we can assign some data for example one into it right so X is a variable which contains the value of one now in JavaScript to declare a variables there are some rules okay so there are mainly uh I think three or four rules you need to remember whenever declaring the variable first rule is you can can declare a variable using numbers letters a dollar symbol or an underscore okay so you can uh declare a variable something like my variable or my variable something like this okay your variable name can also start with a dollar symbol so for example dollar my variable or you can also start your variable Name by underscore like this my variable okay you can also declare a variable using a number after a letter or a keyword for example you want to declare X1 you can declare a variable but a variable cannot start with a number so this is not valid okay so X1 is valid but one X is not valid because your variable cannot start with a number the next rule is your variable cannot contain the reserved keywords in JavaScript so there are a number of keyword which are reserved in JavaScript and with this course when we learn more we will learn more about these keyword for example there is a keyword called VAR or there is a keyword called function these are reserved keywords and you cannot declare a variable using these keywords okay now I will show you some more interesting stuff so if you have a Google Chrome browser just open your Google Chrome browser and then right click on it and then go to the last option which says inspect element okay and this is the thing which will help you to debug and find the errors into your JavaScript code so for example go to console here and in here for example I will declare a variable called X is equal to 1 and press enter and it will give you the result one something like this I will make it a little bit bigger so it will give you the result one right or for example you can give a variable called Y is equal to 5 and it will give you the result five now you have two variables X and Y which you can use in your console here so for example X + Y when you enter it will give you six because X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 5 and when you add these two it will give you six right now I have told you that a variable cannot start with a number so let's check here if this variable when we declared with a number will it pass or not so one my well for example okay which start with a number and press enter and it will give you this error which says uncut syntax error right so this is not allowed but when we declare a variable something like my well and and assign some value in here then it's not going to give you the error now let's try to uh declare a variable with underscore for example underscore my well is equal to 1 and press enter and it's totally valid and now let's try to declare a variable with a dollar symbol so dollar and my well and this is equal to 6 for example and it's also totally valid okay so this console will help you to debug your code and even show you if you have some errors in your code right now let's see how these variable Works in JavaScript so for example you declare a variable called X is equal to 6 and Y is equal to 10 okay so I have already told you that you can do something like x + y and it will give you the sum and whenever you will do X or Yus X then it will give you the substraction you can do the opposite x Y and it will give you the minus value right now to multiply these two numbers you can do y multiplied by X so estx is the multiplication symbol in JavaScript so press enter and it will give you the multiplication whenever you do for example y ided x so y ided x is 1.6 whatever is the value of uh this division it will give you now there is a special uh symbol called mod in JavaScript so whenever you do y mod x and press enter then it will give you the remainder of the division of the variable you are dividing so the value of y was 10 and the value of x was 6 so when you divide y by X then you would get four as remainder so this modulus gives you the remainder now JavaScript is also intelligent enough to recognize what operation you want to do with your numbers for example you want to do 4 4 multiplied by 5 it will give you 16 and not zero right so it will give the importance to the multiplication first and then the subtraction or for example you want to divide and multiply and add or subtract something at the same time it will give the Precedence something like multiplication then division then addition and then the subtraction okay or if you want to make your code more clear you can do something like this so you can add a bracket here and inside this bracket you can do 4 minus 4 and then after the bracket you can do multiply it by five and press enter it will give you 0o because this bracket has more priority than your multiplication or your division symbols okay so in this way you can use uh these variables and commands in JavaScript by the way if you are using Firefox you can also use this consoles so go to Firefox and right click and once again go to inspect element and in here go to console and you have this console here x is equal to one and it will give you the same answer okay so if you have a Firefox for Google Chrome you can debug your code and find errors in it and do many more things with this uh view here so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for
