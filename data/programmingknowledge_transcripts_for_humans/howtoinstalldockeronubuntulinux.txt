00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - docker on your Ubuntu operating system
00:06 - we are going to install docker using
00:09 - standard Ubuntu repositories but if you
00:13 - want to install docker using the docker
00:15 - website it's also fine so let me show
00:19 - you if you want to install the latest
00:21 - and greatest version then what you can
00:24 - do is you can just search for install
00:26 - docker Ubuntu and then the first link
00:29 - which will appear here will be from
00:31 - Doc's dot-com and I'm going to just
00:35 - click on this link and when you scroll
00:37 - down in this page you will be able to
00:40 - see different methods of installing
00:42 - docker on your window operating system
00:45 - the first is installed using
00:47 - repositories so using this method you
00:50 - will get the latest and greatest version
00:52 - of docker on your Ubuntu operating
00:55 - system the second way of installing
00:58 - docker on your urban to operating system
01:00 - is by just installing it why are the
01:03 - standard Ubuntu library so whenever you
01:06 - first give this docker command on your
01:10 - open to operating system and then press
01:12 - Enter you will see that it's going to
01:16 - say command docker not found but can be
01:19 - installed with this command so we are
01:22 - going to use this command and whenever
01:25 - you install docker using this command
01:27 - also it's going to work perfectly fine
01:31 - it may be a little bit older version but
01:34 - it's going to work for all of your needs
01:37 - so I'm going to just copy this command
01:40 - from here and then paste it on the
01:44 - terminal and then press ENTER and then
01:46 - I'm going to just give my open to is
01:49 - password and then press ENTER and then
01:51 - press Y and then press ENTER once again
01:54 - which is going to start the download of
01:56 - the docker on your window operating
01:58 - system so I will wait for this process
02:00 - to complete so once this command is done
02:02 - I'm going to clear the terminal and
02:05 - let's check which version of docker is
02:07 - installed so I'm going to just give the
02:09 - docker - - version command and it's
02:13 - going to
02:14 - give me this result which says docker
02:16 - version nineteen point three point eight
02:20 - so this might not be the latest version
02:23 - but it'll work for all of your needs
02:26 - hopefully now let's check whether docker
02:31 - is running or is it enabled and if it's
02:36 - not enabled then we are going to start
02:39 - this service by enabling it and then
02:42 - starting it so to do this you can just
02:46 - give this command sudo systemctl and
02:50 - then just write status and then just
02:54 - write docker here and then press ENTER
02:57 - so you can see it says it's loaded but
03:01 - right now it's inactive or dead okay so
03:05 - to enable it what we can do is we can
03:08 - give this command so instead of status
03:11 - this time we are going to say enable
03:15 - here and then I'm going to just give
03:18 - this flag which is now and then press
03:20 - Enter which is going to start and enable
03:23 - the docker so when you just see the
03:27 - status once again you will see that now
03:29 - it's active and running okay if it
03:33 - doesn't work out of the box then just
03:35 - reboot you're open to operating system
03:38 - and see if this status is active and
03:40 - running or not okay so once you see that
03:44 - this status is active and running here
03:47 - then you can just press Q to just exit
03:51 - from this command and then we are going
03:53 - to just clear the terminal once again
03:55 - and now let's check whether docker is
03:58 - working with the docker hub and let's
04:02 - just give and test whether docker is
04:05 - working generally on our open to
04:08 - operating system or not so the simplest
04:10 - command to test docker is just give this
04:13 - command docker run hello - world ok and
04:20 - then press Enter so you can see it says
04:22 - got permission denied while trying to
04:24 - connect to dock
04:26 - demon we are going to once again give
04:30 - this command with the sudo privileges ok
04:32 - so just give sudo and then give a docker
04:35 - and hello hello world command and now
04:38 - this command has worked and let me just
04:41 - briefly tell you what this command has
04:44 - done so first of all docker is going to
04:48 - search for this hello world image into
04:52 - your local open to operating system so
04:56 - you can see unable to find image hello
05:00 - world latest latest is the tag locally
05:04 - so docker has tried to find this image
05:07 - locally and if this image is not present
05:12 - locally then its going to pull the
05:14 - latest version of hello world image from
05:17 - that docker hub repository so that's
05:21 - what it is doing in this command and
05:24 - it's pulling this image from the
05:27 - repository and after that it's going to
05:29 - run this image from this repository and
05:32 - if you see this hello from docker
05:35 - message then everything is working on
05:38 - your docker with your boon to operating
05:42 - system you can now also run this command
05:45 - docker images after giving the
05:49 - HelloWorld command and once again it
05:51 - gives me this permission so I should
05:54 - always use sudo before giving the docker
05:57 - commands right and you can see now it's
06:01 - giving me this image which is the image
06:04 - which I have pulled from the docker hub
06:08 - recently ok so whenever you give docker
06:11 - images command it's going to give you
06:14 - the list of all the images which you
06:16 - have locally on your open to operating
06:19 - system so this is how you can download
06:21 - and install and enable docker on your
06:25 - window operating system I hope you
06:27 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
06:29 - the next video
