00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install and set up
00:04 - Microsoft SQL server on your Mac
00:07 - operating system so as you might already
00:10 - know that you can't install Microsoft
00:14 - SQL Server management Studio directly on
00:16 - your Mac operating system because it's
00:19 - an Windows based application so we are
00:22 - going to install a different client to
00:26 - connect to our Microsoft SQL Server
00:29 - which is called Azure data Studio which
00:32 - is a crossplatform
00:34 - application and we are going to install
00:37 - Microsoft SQL server using Docker on our
00:40 - Mac operating system so let me first
00:43 - show you how you can install Docker on
00:46 - your Mac operating system so first of
00:48 - all open your favorite browser and
00:50 - search for Docker and the first link
00:51 - which will appear here will be from
00:53 - doer. so we are going to click on this
00:55 - link and straight away we are on this
00:58 - doer. comom website now in order to
01:01 - install Docker click on get started now
01:05 - on this page you can see get started
01:06 - with Docker and you will see some
01:09 - options to install Docker first one is
01:13 - for Docker for Mac for apple chips that
01:17 - means if you have apple chips like M1 M2
01:20 - M3 then you can just click on this
01:23 - button if you have mac with Intel chips
01:28 - then you can click on this option with
01:29 - ISS um download for Mac Intel chips I
01:33 - have a Macbook which supports apple
01:35 - chips so I'm going to just click on this
01:38 - uh download for mac Apple chip button
01:41 - which is going to start the download for
01:44 - this DMG file so just wait for this
01:48 - download to finish and once this DMG
01:50 - file is downloaded I'm going to click on
01:52 - this DMG file and let me minimize my
01:55 - browser so the installation of Docker is
01:59 - really simple you just need to drag this
02:01 - draer symbol into your applications
02:04 - folder if you're using your MacBooks
02:07 - trackpad then just press command key and
02:11 - then just drag and drop this icon into
02:14 - your applications folder which is going
02:17 - to start the copying process you can see
02:19 - copying Docker to Applications just wait
02:22 - for a few
02:24 - seconds and once this is copied we can
02:27 - close this window eject this Docker from
02:31 - our Macbook so I can just right click on
02:34 - this Docker icon and then click on eject
02:36 - Docker now once Docker is copied into
02:39 - your applications folder you can go to
02:42 - your Launchpad section and here search
02:45 - for Docker and you will be able to see
02:47 - the docker icon here so I'm going to
02:49 - click on this Docker icon which is going
02:51 - to start Docker on your Mac operating
02:54 - system at this point you just need to
02:56 - wait for a few seconds and you will see
02:59 - this this kind of window which appears
03:02 - so here you can see uh Docker
03:04 - subscription service agreement and you
03:07 - will also see that Docker is starting on
03:12 - your Mac operating system and at the top
03:14 - you can see uh this kind of Docker icon
03:17 - right so I'm going to click on accept
03:20 - here and now I can see this uh window
03:22 - which says complete the installation of
03:24 - Docker desktop the configuration below
03:27 - can be changed later in the setting
03:30 - for now I'm going to choose uh this
03:32 - option which says use recommended
03:34 - settings which requires the password I'm
03:37 - going to just click on finish here and
03:39 - then I'm going to provide my Mac books
03:41 - password which I use to log to my Mac
03:43 - operating
03:45 - system and once that's done this window
03:49 - appears you can also see some uh
03:52 - notifications here which I'm going to
03:54 - close so on this next window Docker will
03:57 - ask you to sign in with your Docker
04:01 - account the creation of Docker account
04:04 - is really simple just click on sign up
04:06 - here and then it's going to redirect you
04:09 - to this kind of web page where you can
04:11 - provide your email username and password
04:15 - and then click on the sign up button
04:18 - which is going to sign you up into your
04:21 - Docker account now this kind of uh
04:24 - dockerhub account is useful when you
04:27 - want to push some images which are some
04:29 - custom images uh into your dockerhub
04:33 - account and then you also need to pull
04:36 - those images so I already have the
04:39 - docker account so I'm going to click on
04:41 - sign in
04:43 - here and then I'm going to sign in with
04:45 - my Docker account and once I'm uh signed
04:48 - in with my Docker account I'm going to
04:50 - click allow here which is going to sign
04:53 - me in in my Docker desktop and here you
04:57 - can see this welcome survey I don't want
04:59 - want to uh give any feedback so I'm
05:01 - going to click on skip survey here and
05:03 - now I can see my Docker
05:06 - desktop so let me just close everything
05:09 - here and this is how this Docker desktop
05:12 - looks like so once Docker is installed
05:16 - on our Mac operating system and it's
05:18 - working now let's move to the second
05:21 - step and in this step we are going to
05:23 - install the Azure data studio so go to
05:26 - your favorite browser and search for
05:28 - Azure data Studio studio and hopefully
05:31 - the top link which will appear here will
05:33 - be from uh Microsoft itself so just
05:38 - click on the link which says Azure data
05:41 - studio and then I'm going to click on no
05:44 - here and straight away you can see the
05:46 - download button here and you can also
05:48 - see it's an open source and CLA platform
05:52 - application so you can download it on
05:54 - your Mac operating system also so I'm
05:56 - going to click on download now here and
05:59 - then when I scroll down a little I will
06:03 - be able to see different options for my
06:07 - Mac operating system so I'm using a Mac
06:10 - operating system which have apple
06:12 - silicon chips so I'm going to click on
06:16 - this option here but if you are using a
06:18 - Mac operating system which support Intel
06:21 - chips then you can also click on this
06:24 - option so let me click on Apple silicon
06:27 - option so if you have uh any Apple
06:30 - silicon chip like M1 M2 M3 then you can
06:34 - click on this option and you can see the
06:36 - download has been started and it's
06:38 - already finished now this is a ZIP file
06:42 - so we just need to click on this
06:44 - downloaded zip file which is going to
06:47 - extract this ZIP file and once this
06:50 - Azure data studio uh file is extracted
06:53 - it's an application file so we can
06:56 - directly drag and drop this application
07:00 - file into our applications folder so
07:04 - just select your file and then drag and
07:07 - drop this Azure data studio in your
07:09 - applications folder so I'm going to just
07:11 - drag and drop here and as you can see
07:14 - now Azure data studio is present in my
07:17 - applications folder once that's done
07:21 - what we can do is I can just click on
07:24 - Launchpad and here I can search for
07:27 - Azure data studio and then click on this
07:30 - uh option which is going to start this
07:33 - Azure data studio so for the first time
07:35 - it's going to look like this and it
07:38 - shows uh some uh notifications I'm going
07:42 - to click on yes here and then close this
07:45 - notification so this Azure data studio
07:49 - interface looks like this so from here
07:52 - you can uh create a new connection new
07:55 - query new notebook and you can even
07:59 - deploy a server from here so we are
08:01 - going to use this Azure data Studio as
08:04 - the Microsoft SQL Server client now
08:08 - let's move forward and let's uh move to
08:11 - the installation and running of
08:14 - Microsoft SQL server using Docker so for
08:18 - this just open your favorite browser
08:20 - once again and then then search for
08:22 - Azure hyphen SQL hyphen Edge Docker
08:26 - image so just write Azure hyphen SQL
08:28 - hyphen Edge Space Docker and then scroll
08:31 - to the option where it says hub.
08:35 - do.com and the official image name is
08:37 - Microsoft hyphen ezure hyphen SQL hyphen
08:42 - edge here so I'm going to click on this
08:44 - link you can see it's by Microsoft and
08:49 - this is the command using which you can
08:51 - pull this image if you want to read more
08:54 - about the usage of this image you can
08:56 - scroll down and you will be able to uh
08:59 - get some kind of documentation of how
09:03 - you can run this image using Docker so
09:07 - let's go step by step we are going to
09:11 - first uh pull this image so pulling
09:14 - image is easy just copy this command and
09:18 - then open your uh terminal and once the
09:21 - terminal is open just give this command
09:24 - which is Docker pull and then this
09:28 - official image name I'm going to press
09:30 - enter which is going to pull this Azure
09:33 - SQL image on my uh Mac operating system
09:38 - so once this image is pulled you will be
09:41 - able to see this image in your Docker
09:45 - desktop also so here when you go to the
09:49 - images section you can see this image is
09:52 - now present right so now the image is
09:55 - there we just need to run this image so
09:58 - to run this image you can see uh some
10:02 - documentation here so this is the
10:05 - command which you can use to run this
10:07 - image and it uses few Flags so first
10:11 - flag is accept Oiler and then when you
10:15 - scroll down here you will be able to see
10:18 - the explanation of all these flags so
10:21 - except OA is for the end user license
10:25 - terms so we just need to agree with
10:28 - these license terms and conditions then
10:31 - there is this
10:33 - mssql essay password which we will use
10:37 - as a password to log to our Microsoft
10:40 - SQL server and then you have this mssql
10:45 - P ID so this is the flag we can use to
10:49 - just tell which type of container you
10:51 - want to uh run there are two options
10:54 - here developer and premium we are going
10:57 - to use the developer option right
10:59 - in addition you can also provide the
11:03 - username the default username is sa
11:06 - which stands for system administrator so
11:09 - using this knowledge I have prepared a
11:12 - Docker run command and this command I'm
11:14 - going to give you in the description of
11:16 - this video also and this command is as
11:19 - follows so first of all we just need to
11:21 - write uh Docker run hyphen e and then we
11:24 - need to accept the oila right so we are
11:27 - going to just write accept oila is equal
11:29 - to 1 then we will provide the password
11:32 - Here I have provided a very simple
11:34 - password but you might want to change
11:37 - this password if you want then we have
11:41 - provided the flag uh for mssql p ID and
11:45 - we are using the developer mode here and
11:49 - the default user here will be the essay
11:52 - user which is for uh system
11:55 - administrator role and the port we are
11:59 - going to a map here will be 1433 here
12:04 - and this will be the image right so just
12:07 - uh copy this uh command from the
12:09 - description of this video go to your
12:11 - terminal once again and here just paste
12:16 - this command in your terminal and then
12:19 - press enter which is going to run your
12:22 - Docker container so now you can see it
12:26 - gives us this kind of uh uh output here
12:30 - that means our Docker container is
12:32 - running and using this password and this
12:37 - username we will be able to uh connect
12:39 - to our Microsoft SQL Server so let's try
12:44 - this Azure data Studio to connect to
12:47 - this server you can also see when you go
12:50 - to your Docker desktop in the containers
12:54 - you will see that this SQL Server is
12:58 - running and we have started this uh 42
13:01 - seconds uh ago and here we are going to
13:04 - create a new connection so here just
13:06 - click on new and then click on uh new
13:10 - connection and then in the connection
13:13 - details first of all connection type
13:15 - will be uh Microsoft SQL Server then
13:19 - select input type parameters then server
13:23 - here is Local Host because we are
13:26 - running this Microsoft SQL Server
13:29 - on the Local Host Port 1433 we have
13:33 - forwarded or mapped this uh uh Port
13:37 - right so just write Local Host here in
13:41 - the server and the username is sa right
13:46 - you can see uh in this command the
13:48 - username is sa and the password is this
13:52 - one so I'm going to copy this password
13:54 - go to my uh Azure data studio and then
13:58 - paste this password I can also click on
14:02 - remember password so from the next time
14:04 - it's going to remember this password
14:06 - other parameters you can leave them as
14:08 - default and then click on connect here
14:11 - and then click on enable trust server
14:15 - certificate and you can see you are
14:17 - connected to your Microsoft SQL Server
14:21 - which we are running as a Docker
14:23 - container right so here when you click
14:25 - on uh databases you will see some uh
14:29 - default databases here so you can open
14:32 - any of the databases from this list so
14:35 - when you click on home here you can see
14:37 - this option which is called uh new query
14:40 - cck on new query here and then I'm going
14:42 - to paste very simple query to create a
14:45 - table and then insert some data into it
14:48 - and the database name here is Master for
14:51 - example let me click on run here and see
14:54 - these uh database queries are successful
14:58 - I can go to to uh the local host and
15:00 - then go to databases and then click on
15:02 - Master here and then you can see this
15:06 - table here which we have created which
15:08 - is called employees and then see these
15:11 - three dots here you can addit data you
15:13 - have the option for script as create and
15:17 - then you can select top thousand records
15:20 - from here so let's select this third
15:22 - option which is select top
15:25 - th000 and then it's going to show us the
15:29 - content of this table right so
15:32 - everything is working fine here and this
15:36 - is how you can uh connect to your my SQL
15:39 - Server which is running as a Docker
15:42 - container on your Mac operating system
15:44 - using this Azure data Studio you can
15:48 - also use a Docker compos file which is
15:51 - going to look like this so I'm going to
15:54 - put the link of this Docker compose file
15:58 - also so in the description so instead of
16:01 - this long command which you have pasted
16:05 - in your terminal you can also use this
16:08 - uh Docker compose file to just uh run
16:12 - this Docker compose file and then create
16:14 - your container the command which you can
16:17 - use to run this Docker compose file is
16:20 - this one so let me just show this
16:22 - command which is Docker hyphen compose
16:25 - space up space up space hyphen D so this
16:29 - is going to start your container and if
16:32 - you want to stop your container instead
16:34 - of up you just write down here okay so
16:38 - this also you can use so this is how you
16:41 - can install and set up Microsoft SQL
16:44 - server on your Mac operating system I
16:46 - hope youve enjoyed this video and I will
16:48 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and set up Microsoft SQL server on your Mac operating system so as you might already know that you can't install Microsoft SQL Server management Studio directly on your Mac operating system because it's an Windows based application so we are going to install a different client to connect to our Microsoft SQL Server which is called Azure data Studio which is a crossplatform application and we are going to install Microsoft SQL server using Docker on our Mac operating system so let me first show you how you can install Docker on your Mac operating system so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Docker and the first link which will appear here will be from doer. so we are going to click on this link and straight away we are on this doer. comom website now in order to install Docker click on get started now on this page you can see get started with Docker and you will see some options to install Docker first one is for Docker for Mac for apple chips that means if you have apple chips like M1 M2 M3 then you can just click on this button if you have mac with Intel chips then you can click on this option with ISS um download for Mac Intel chips I have a Macbook which supports apple chips so I'm going to just click on this uh download for mac Apple chip button which is going to start the download for this DMG file so just wait for this download to finish and once this DMG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this DMG file and let me minimize my browser so the installation of Docker is really simple you just need to drag this draer symbol into your applications folder if you're using your MacBooks trackpad then just press command key and then just drag and drop this icon into your applications folder which is going to start the copying process you can see copying Docker to Applications just wait for a few seconds and once this is copied we can close this window eject this Docker from our Macbook so I can just right click on this Docker icon and then click on eject Docker now once Docker is copied into your applications folder you can go to your Launchpad section and here search for Docker and you will be able to see the docker icon here so I'm going to click on this Docker icon which is going to start Docker on your Mac operating system at this point you just need to wait for a few seconds and you will see this this kind of window which appears so here you can see uh Docker subscription service agreement and you will also see that Docker is starting on your Mac operating system and at the top you can see uh this kind of Docker icon right so I'm going to click on accept here and now I can see this uh window which says complete the installation of Docker desktop the configuration below can be changed later in the setting for now I'm going to choose uh this option which says use recommended settings which requires the password I'm going to just click on finish here and then I'm going to provide my Mac books password which I use to log to my Mac operating system and once that's done this window appears you can also see some uh notifications here which I'm going to close so on this next window Docker will ask you to sign in with your Docker account the creation of Docker account is really simple just click on sign up here and then it's going to redirect you to this kind of web page where you can provide your email username and password and then click on the sign up button which is going to sign you up into your Docker account now this kind of uh dockerhub account is useful when you want to push some images which are some custom images uh into your dockerhub account and then you also need to pull those images so I already have the docker account so I'm going to click on sign in here and then I'm going to sign in with my Docker account and once I'm uh signed in with my Docker account I'm going to click allow here which is going to sign me in in my Docker desktop and here you can see this welcome survey I don't want want to uh give any feedback so I'm going to click on skip survey here and now I can see my Docker desktop so let me just close everything here and this is how this Docker desktop looks like so once Docker is installed on our Mac operating system and it's working now let's move to the second step and in this step we are going to install the Azure data studio so go to your favorite browser and search for Azure data Studio studio and hopefully the top link which will appear here will be from uh Microsoft itself so just click on the link which says Azure data studio and then I'm going to click on no here and straight away you can see the download button here and you can also see it's an open source and CLA platform application so you can download it on your Mac operating system also so I'm going to click on download now here and then when I scroll down a little I will be able to see different options for my Mac operating system so I'm using a Mac operating system which have apple silicon chips so I'm going to click on this option here but if you are using a Mac operating system which support Intel chips then you can also click on this option so let me click on Apple silicon option so if you have uh any Apple silicon chip like M1 M2 M3 then you can click on this option and you can see the download has been started and it's already finished now this is a ZIP file so we just need to click on this downloaded zip file which is going to extract this ZIP file and once this Azure data studio uh file is extracted it's an application file so we can directly drag and drop this application file into our applications folder so just select your file and then drag and drop this Azure data studio in your applications folder so I'm going to just drag and drop here and as you can see now Azure data studio is present in my applications folder once that's done what we can do is I can just click on Launchpad and here I can search for Azure data studio and then click on this uh option which is going to start this Azure data studio so for the first time it's going to look like this and it shows uh some uh notifications I'm going to click on yes here and then close this notification so this Azure data studio interface looks like this so from here you can uh create a new connection new query new notebook and you can even deploy a server from here so we are going to use this Azure data Studio as the Microsoft SQL Server client now let's move forward and let's uh move to the installation and running of Microsoft SQL server using Docker so for this just open your favorite browser once again and then then search for Azure hyphen SQL hyphen Edge Docker image so just write Azure hyphen SQL hyphen Edge Space Docker and then scroll to the option where it says hub. do.com and the official image name is Microsoft hyphen ezure hyphen SQL hyphen edge here so I'm going to click on this link you can see it's by Microsoft and this is the command using which you can pull this image if you want to read more about the usage of this image you can scroll down and you will be able to uh get some kind of documentation of how you can run this image using Docker so let's go step by step we are going to first uh pull this image so pulling image is easy just copy this command and then open your uh terminal and once the terminal is open just give this command which is Docker pull and then this official image name I'm going to press enter which is going to pull this Azure SQL image on my uh Mac operating system so once this image is pulled you will be able to see this image in your Docker desktop also so here when you go to the images section you can see this image is now present right so now the image is there we just need to run this image so to run this image you can see uh some documentation here so this is the command which you can use to run this image and it uses few Flags so first flag is accept Oiler and then when you scroll down here you will be able to see the explanation of all these flags so except OA is for the end user license terms so we just need to agree with these license terms and conditions then there is this mssql essay password which we will use as a password to log to our Microsoft SQL server and then you have this mssql P ID so this is the flag we can use to just tell which type of container you want to uh run there are two options here developer and premium we are going to use the developer option right in addition you can also provide the username the default username is sa which stands for system administrator so using this knowledge I have prepared a Docker run command and this command I'm going to give you

for mssql p ID and we are using the developer mode here and the default user here will be the essay user which is for uh system administrator role and the port we are going to a map here will be 1433 here and this will be the image right so just uh copy this uh command from the description of this video go to your terminal once again and here just paste this command in your terminal and then press enter which is going to run your Docker container so now you can see it gives us this kind of uh uh output here that means our Docker container is running and using this password and this username we will be able to uh connect to our Microsoft SQL Server so let's try this Azure data Studio to connect to this server you can also see when you go to your Docker desktop in the containers you will see that this SQL Server is running and we have started this uh 42 seconds uh ago and here we are going to create a new connection so here just click on new and then click on uh new connection and then in the connection details first of all connection type will be uh Microsoft SQL Server then select input type parameters then server here is Local Host because we are running this Microsoft SQL Server on the Local Host Port 1433 we have forwarded or mapped this uh uh Port right so just write Local Host here in the server and the username is sa right you can see uh in this command the username is sa and the password is this one so I'm going to copy this password go to my uh Azure data studio and then paste this password I can also click on remember password so from the next time it's going to remember this password other parameters you can leave them as default and then click on connect here and then click on enable trust server certificate and you can see you are connected to your Microsoft SQL Server which we are running as a Docker container right so here when you click on uh databases you will see some uh default databases here so you can open any of the databases from this list so when you click on home here you can see this option which is called uh new query cck on new query here and then I'm going to paste very simple query to create a table and then insert some data into it and the database name here is Master for example let me click on run here and see these uh database queries are successful I can go to to uh the local host and then go to databases and then click on Master here and then you can see this table here which we have created which is called employees and then see these three dots here you can addit data you have the option for script as create and then you can select top thousand records from here so let's select this third option which is select top th000 and then it's going to show us the content of this table right so everything is working fine here and this is how you can uh connect to your my SQL Server which is running as a Docker container on your Mac operating system using this Azure data Studio you can also use a Docker compos file which is going to look like this so I'm going to put the link of this Docker compose file also so in the description so instead of this long command which you have pasted in your terminal you can also use this uh Docker compose file to just uh run this Docker compose file and then create your container the command which you can use to run this Docker compose file is this one so let me just show this command which is Docker hyphen compose space up space up space hyphen D so this is going to start your container and if you want to stop your container instead of up you just write down here okay so this also you can use so this is how you can install and set up Microsoft SQL server on your Mac operating system I hope youve enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
