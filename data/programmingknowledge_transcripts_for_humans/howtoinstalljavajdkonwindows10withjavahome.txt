00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Java jdk on your Windows 10 operating
00:07 - system
00:09 - now if you want to check whether Java is
00:13 - installed on your Windows 10 operating
00:15 - system already then what you can do is
00:18 - you can just go to this search bar and
00:22 - then search for CMD or command prompt
00:25 - and once this command prompt is open you
00:29 - can just type this command Java space
00:33 - hyphen version
00:36 - and if this command gives you this kind
00:39 - of response which says Java is not
00:41 - recognized as an internal or external
00:44 - command that means Java and jdk is most
00:48 - probably not installed on your Windows
00:51 - 10 operating system one more way of just
00:55 - verifying this is just give this Java C
00:59 - command which we use to compile the Java
01:02 - files and then Java c space hyphen
01:06 - version and most probably it will also
01:08 - fail if the Java jdk is not installed on
01:12 - your Windows 10 operating system so
01:14 - let's see how we can install Java jdk on
01:18 - our Windows 10 operating system so first
01:20 - of all open your favorite browser and
01:22 - search for Java jdk and most probably
01:25 - the first link which will appear here
01:26 - will be from oracle.com
01:30 - so I'm going to just click on this link
01:33 - I will also paste this link in the
01:35 - description of this video
01:37 - now here let me just increase the font
01:40 - size here so you can see it in a better
01:43 - way
01:44 - so here you can see at the time of
01:46 - making this video Java SE 13 is the
01:50 - latest version now when I scroll down
01:53 - Java se11 is the long term support
01:58 - version LTS version and also we have the
02:01 - Java SC
02:03 - 8u241 build also so in this video we are
02:09 - going to install the latest version
02:11 - which is the Java se13
02:13 - so just go under Java se13 and just
02:17 - click on this option which says jdk
02:20 - download
02:21 - and once this page is open you just need
02:25 - to scroll down a little where it says
02:28 - Java SE development kit
02:32 - 13.0.2 this is the version at the time
02:34 - of making this video and then you can
02:36 - see all the operating system for which
02:39 - this Java jdk is available
02:42 - now for Windows operating system this
02:46 - jdk Windows xst4 bin dot exe file is
02:51 - available so I am going to just click on
02:53 - this exe file not the zip file so I'm
02:56 - going to just click on this exe file
02:58 - here and then I'm going to just say I
03:01 - received and accept the Oracle
03:03 - technology Network license agreement and
03:07 - then I'm going to just click on this
03:09 - download uh
03:11 - jdk.exe file
03:13 - now once this executable file is
03:16 - downloaded I'm going to just click on
03:18 - this executable file and I'm going to
03:20 - minimize my browser
03:23 - and here it says do you want to allow
03:26 - this app to make changes on your device
03:28 - I will say yes and now you can see this
03:30 - initial setup windows I am going to just
03:32 - click on next here now on this next
03:35 - window this will be the default location
03:37 - where your Java jdk will be installed so
03:41 - if you don't have the good reason to
03:43 - change it I will recommend it to just
03:46 - leave it as it is and just click on next
03:48 - button
03:49 - and now it's going to just copy all
03:53 - these files and in few seconds you will
03:55 - be able to see this message which says
03:58 - that Java development kit 13.0.2 64-bit
04:02 - is successfully installed so now I am
04:05 - going to just close this window and I
04:08 - will go to the location where this Java
04:12 - jdk file is installed on my computer so
04:16 - I will go to this PC C directory and
04:20 - then program files and then you can see
04:23 - this Java directory here and inside this
04:26 - Java folder you will be able to see the
04:30 - jdk version you have installed so I have
04:32 - installed the Java jdk
04:34 - 13.0.2 so I will just click on this and
04:38 - the important folder here is the bin
04:41 - folder where all the Java related files
04:46 - are present for example Java C dot EXE
04:49 - will be there and other Java related
04:53 - executable file are all present inside
04:56 - this bin folder so the next step is to
05:01 - set this bin folder as our environment
05:05 - variable so that we can run all the Java
05:09 - related command from the command prompt
05:12 - so just copy this path up to the bin
05:15 - folder of the Java jdk and then go to
05:19 - your windows icon just click on the
05:22 - Windows icon and then click on the
05:24 - settings here and in the settings just
05:26 - click on the system option here and here
05:30 - you can search for environment variables
05:33 - so just type environment variables here
05:36 - and you need to choose this option which
05:38 - says edit the system environment
05:40 - variables
05:42 - and this is going to open this kind of
05:44 - window so here go to environment
05:47 - variables and here you need to set your
05:51 - environment variables related to Java
05:54 - so here what I'm going to do is I'm
05:56 - going to just click on the path
05:59 - environment variables just click on path
06:02 - environment variable and then click on
06:04 - edit and here just paste your path for
06:09 - the Java bin folder
06:11 - at the end okay so this path is C
06:14 - program files Java jdk
06:17 - 13.0.2 backslash bin and then I'm going
06:20 - to just press enter and then I'm going
06:23 - to just click OK and this environment
06:26 - variable is set now also if you want to
06:30 - develop with Java or Java related tools
06:34 - you might also want to set your Java
06:38 - home environment variable so to set the
06:41 - Java home environment variable what you
06:44 - can do is you can just click on the new
06:46 - Option here and then the environment
06:49 - variable we need to write here is Java
06:53 - home so variable name is Java underscore
06:55 - home all in capital letters and the
06:59 - value for the variable will be the path
07:02 - up to jdk folder so you don't need to go
07:06 - inside the bin folder you just need to
07:09 - copy this folder path up to the jdk
07:13 - folder so I'm going to just copy this
07:15 - path also and then paste it here as the
07:19 - value for the Java home environment
07:21 - variable so C program files Java and
07:25 - then jdk hyphen 13.0.2 in my case okay
07:30 - you don't need to give the bin folder
07:33 - path here for the Java home environment
07:35 - variable I will click OK here and you
07:38 - can see this Java home environment
07:40 - variable is set now so I will just click
07:43 - OK and then click OK and then I will
07:47 - close all the windows
07:49 - now I will once again open my command
07:52 - prompt so if you have any previously
07:55 - opened command prompt just close all the
07:58 - command prompt which you have uh
08:00 - previously opened before installing Java
08:03 - and then now open the new command prompt
08:07 - so just type command prompt in the
08:10 - search bar and then open your command
08:12 - prompt here and then we are going to
08:15 - check all the Java related commands one
08:18 - by one so the First Command we are going
08:21 - to check is the Java version so just
08:24 - write Java hyphen
08:26 - version here and then press enter and
08:29 - it's going to give you the Java version
08:31 - which we have installed we have
08:33 - installed the Java version 13.0.2 that's
08:36 - why you can see here the Java version
08:39 - also you can see with the Java jdk
08:43 - installation this runtime and
08:46 - environment or Java JRE is automatically
08:49 - installed with the same version so you
08:52 - don't need to install Java JRE
08:54 - separately now we are going to check the
08:57 - Java C command so I'm going to just
08:58 - write Java c hyphen
09:01 - version here so Java C is the command
09:05 - line tool using which you can compile
09:09 - your Java files right so you can see it
09:12 - says this error it gives us this error
09:15 - which says invalid flag hyphen version
09:18 - so version I have typed wrong here so I
09:21 - will just once again give this command
09:25 - again which is the Java C version and
09:29 - it's going to give you the Java C
09:32 - version which will be the same version
09:34 - as the Java version okay one more
09:38 - command you can give here to check if
09:41 - your environment variable is set
09:43 - perfectly for the Java home environment
09:45 - variable and that command is
09:48 - Echo and then give percentage symbol and
09:52 - then give a Java underscore home this is
09:56 - the environment variable we have set and
09:58 - then once again percentage okay so Echo
10:01 - percentage Java underscore home
10:03 - percentage and it's going to give you
10:05 - this path which we have set in our Java
10:08 - home environment variable so all the
10:11 - things are working fine now and now you
10:14 - are ready to work with Java and Java
10:18 - related programs on your Windows 10
10:21 - operating system
10:22 - so I hope you have enjoyed this video
10:24 - and I will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Java jdk on your Windows 10 operating system now if you want to check whether Java is installed on your Windows 10 operating system already then what you can do is you can just go to this search bar and then search for CMD or command prompt and once this command prompt is open you can just type this command Java space hyphen version and if this command gives you this kind of response which says Java is not recognized as an internal or external command that means Java and jdk is most probably not installed on your Windows 10 operating system one more way of just verifying this is just give this Java C command which we use to compile the Java files and then Java c space hyphen version and most probably it will also fail if the Java jdk is not installed on your Windows 10 operating system so let's see how we can install Java jdk on our Windows 10 operating system so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Java jdk and most probably the first link which will appear here will be from oracle.com so I'm going to just click on this link I will also paste this link in the description of this video now here let me just increase the font size here so you can see it in a better way so here you can see at the time of making this video Java SE 13 is the latest version now when I scroll down Java se11 is the long term support version LTS version and also we have the Java SC 8u241 build also so in this video we are going to install the latest version which is the Java se13 so just go under Java se13 and just click on this option which says jdk download and once this page is open you just need to scroll down a little where it says Java SE development kit 13.0.2 this is the version at the time of making this video and then you can see all the operating system for which this Java jdk is available now for Windows operating system this jdk Windows xst4 bin dot exe file is available so I am going to just click on this exe file not the zip file so I'm going to just click on this exe file here and then I'm going to just say I received and accept the Oracle technology Network license agreement and then I'm going to just click on this download uh jdk.exe file now once this executable file is downloaded I'm going to just click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize my browser and here it says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device I will say yes and now you can see this initial setup windows I am going to just click on next here now on this next window this will be the default location where your Java jdk will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it I will recommend it to just leave it as it is and just click on next button and now it's going to just copy all these files and in few seconds you will be able to see this message which says that Java development kit 13.0.2 64bit is successfully installed so now I am going to just close this window and I will go to the location where this Java jdk file is installed on my computer so I will go to this PC C directory and then program files and then you can see this Java directory here and inside this Java folder you will be able to see the jdk version you have installed so I have installed the Java jdk 13.0.2 so I will just click on this and the important folder here is the bin folder where all the Java related files are present for example Java C dot EXE will be there and other Java related executable file are all present inside this bin folder so the next step is to set this bin folder as our environment variable so that we can run all the Java related command from the command prompt so just copy this path up to the bin folder of the Java jdk and then go to your windows icon just click on the Windows icon and then click on the settings here and in the settings just click on the system option here and here you can search for environment variables so just type environment variables here and you need to choose this option which says edit the system environment variables and this is going to open this kind of window so here go to environment variables and here you need to set your environment variables related to Java so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to just click on the path environment variables just click on path environment variable and then click on edit and here just paste your path for the Java bin folder at the end okay so this path is C program files Java jdk 13.0.2 backslash bin and then I'm going to just press enter and then I'm going to just click OK and this environment variable is set now also if you want to develop with Java or Java related tools you might also want to set your Java home environment variable so to set the Java home environment variable what you can do is you can just click on the new Option here and then the environment variable we need to write here is Java home so variable name is Java underscore home all in capital letters and the value for the variable will be the path up to jdk folder so you don't need to go inside the bin folder you just need to copy this folder path up to the jdk folder so I'm going to just copy this path also and then paste it here as the value for the Java home environment variable so C program files Java and then jdk hyphen 13.0.2 in my case okay you don't need to give the bin folder path here for the Java home environment variable I will click OK here and you can see this Java home environment variable is set now so I will just click OK and then click OK and then I will close all the windows now I will once again open my command prompt so if you have any previously opened command prompt just close all the command prompt which you have uh previously opened before installing Java and then now open the new command prompt so just type command prompt in the search bar and then open your command prompt here and then we are going to check all the Java related commands one by one so the First Command we are going to check is the Java version so just write Java hyphen version here and then press enter and it's going to give you the Java version which we have installed we have installed the Java version 13.0.2 that's why you can see here the Java version also you can see with the Java jdk installation this runtime and environment or Java JRE is automatically installed with the same version so you don't need to install Java JRE separately now we are going to check the Java C command so I'm going to just write Java c hyphen version here so Java C is the command line tool using which you can compile your Java files right so you can see it says this error it gives us this error which says invalid flag hyphen version so version I have typed wrong here so I will just once again give this command again which is the Java C version and it's going to give you the Java C version which will be the same version as the Java version okay one more command you can give here to check if your environment variable is set perfectly for the Java home environment variable and that command is Echo and then give percentage symbol and then give a Java underscore home this is the environment variable we have set and then once again percentage okay so Echo percentage Java underscore home percentage and it's going to give you this path which we have set in our Java home environment variable so all the things are working fine now and now you are ready to work with Java and Java related programs on your Windows 10 operating system so I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
