00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we will be creating our the first task
00:05 - that is the basically in which we will
00:07 - whatever we have covered till now we
00:09 - will use those things so basically let
00:11 - me tell you the scenario what we will be
00:12 - doing in this particular video so
00:14 - basically we will first read the input
00:16 - from the user okay that will be the IP
00:20 - or domain name and next what we will do
00:23 - we will be uh using the Ping command to
00:27 - Ping that particular server okay so
00:30 - things are very easy if you want to go
00:33 - ahead with the video like with yourself
00:34 - and you can go for it you so it will
00:37 - give you the more confidence about it
00:38 - okay so now I will use this scenario and
00:41 - I will create one script so I actually
00:43 - already have opened my visual studio
00:45 - code and you have to just create one
00:50 - script and I will use the hashbank
00:55 - sorry
00:57 - okay so now what we have to do we have
01:00 - to take input from the user so already
01:01 - we have covered how we can take inputs
01:03 - so you can use the read here and you
01:05 - will prompt for the user like which
01:08 - server
01:10 - you want
01:11 - to Ping okay it can be any server it all
01:16 - depends upon you and I will create one
01:17 - variable here server address
01:20 - and next moving forward what I will use
01:23 - the Ping command so basically in ping
01:25 - command we have some options like hyphen
01:26 - C so whatever if you use normal ping
01:30 - command so like if I will use google.com
01:33 - so here you can see it will go in the
01:36 - infinite but if we want only for the
01:38 - three or four okay so what we can do we
01:42 - can give the count for three and the
01:45 - deadline for
01:47 - five second after five seconds if
01:49 - nothing like Ping command doesn't get
01:52 - any response and it will exit
01:54 - so next what we will do we have to just
01:57 - give this name
01:59 - server
02:00 - address now we are good to go what we
02:03 - have to do we have to just add the
02:04 - permission to this file using
02:08 - CH mode command and then I will run this
02:11 - not zero one I have to write 0 6.
02:15 - okay so I want to Ping Google server
02:18 - that is 8.8.8
02:22 - okay so here you can see I'm getting the
02:24 - response okay and now what I will do I
02:27 - will enter some random IP
02:30 - like 8.6.5 52.4 so it will wait for the
02:34 - Five series five second and
02:36 - automatically it will exit
02:37 - so here you can see
02:41 - okay so yeah here we can see five
02:43 - packing transmitter but zero is saved
02:45 - 100 packet loss okay so in this way you
02:48 - can create different Escape so that will
02:50 - be helpful for you so that's all for
02:52 - today's video I hope you like this our
02:53 - first starts so that's all guys and I
02:56 - hope you liked it I will meet you in the
02:58 - next video thank you for watching
