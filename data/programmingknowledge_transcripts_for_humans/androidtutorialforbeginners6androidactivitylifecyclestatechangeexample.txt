00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - the basic overview of Android activity
00:11 - life cycle now in order to understand
00:15 - this activity life cycle in a more
00:19 - deeper sense we will take an example
00:23 - which will show how these U activity
00:27 - methods will be called in some order so
00:32 - in the last video I have shown you in
00:34 - this main activity uh. Java file there
00:38 - is a method called oncreate which uh is
00:42 - called first whenever you launch your
00:46 - application right and I have shown you
00:49 - uh a diagram like this uh which shows
00:53 - the order of the calling of this method
00:57 - one by one whenever your activi is
00:59 - launched
01:00 - two activity is running two activity is
01:03 - shut down so we will try to call all
01:07 - these method one by one and we will see
01:12 - how uh these method are called in order
01:16 - right so what we are going to do is in
01:19 - our main or main activity. Java class we
01:24 - are going to import
01:27 - one more Library so import
01:30 - Port
01:35 - Android
01:37 - dot
01:42 - util
01:45 - dot. log okay so just uh add the this um
01:52 - library and this is just for logging uh
01:55 - messages to your console here okay so we
02:00 - will log some messages while calling uh
02:03 - these uh methods and we will see uh
02:06 - which method uh is you know logged first
02:11 - so that we know that this is called
02:13 - first and then other method and then
02:15 - other meod and then uh we will uh just
02:19 - make a string so
02:24 - public
02:27 - static final then and we will name our
02:31 - string
02:33 - so string and the name of the string for
02:36 - example
02:37 - my
02:39 - my tag because we are going to uh use
02:43 - tags and then we will just name our
02:48 - string something so for example we uh
02:51 - name our tag as my custom message okay
02:56 - and now to log this what you can do is
02:59 - is you can just call log in your on
03:04 - create method so this is my on create
03:06 - method inside my on create method I will
03:09 - write
03:10 - log dot i and then my tag name so my tag
03:17 - name is this
03:19 - one comma the message I want to display
03:23 - so I want to display for example I for
03:26 - the first time when it's called I want
03:28 - to call this on create method okay so
03:32 - this is simple uh you know logging
03:35 - messages whenever this uh method is
03:38 - called now we want uh you know every
03:43 - method here so on create on start on
03:46 - resume so you can do the same for every
03:49 - method on create or and then you can
03:53 - just copy this and paste it and then do
03:56 - it for on start so this I have done or I
04:01 - have uhu uh you know written in my blog
04:07 - all the method which you can call on
04:09 - start on resume on pause on stop all
04:13 - these method which are called here right
04:15 - so that you don't have to you know uh
04:18 - rewrite this code you can just go to my
04:21 - blog and just see this code and you can
04:24 - copy uh all the code up till on Destroy
04:29 - method and this is the whole uh code of
04:33 - this Java file which I'm using right now
04:36 - here okay so you you just need to copy
04:39 - this from on start to on Destroy okay
04:45 - and all the you know uh library is
04:49 - imported here log util and this is just
04:53 - the same example I'm going to show you
04:55 - so I'm going to copy this and paste it
04:57 - here in order to save the time
05:00 - now once you have uh copied and pasted
05:03 - all the method these are the method
05:06 - which are same as on create so on create
05:10 - on start on resume on pause which are
05:15 - listed in this diagram
05:18 - right and now what we are going to do is
05:21 - in order to display these messages what
05:24 - we are going to do is first of all uh uh
05:28 - go to your activity _ main XML file and
05:32 - in here in the console you can customize
05:35 - your messages so just go to this little
05:39 - combo box here and just uh right click
05:43 - or click added filter configurations and
05:47 - you can uh use your own configuration
05:49 - for example I want to make
05:52 - my uh custom message for example or my
05:58 - uh
06:00 - messages okay so I made my own uh uh own
06:05 - uh message configuration and then I can
06:09 - use the tag here so my tag was my custom
06:13 - message right so in here you can see in
06:17 - this the tag name was my custom message
06:22 - or in my activity you can see the tag
06:26 - name was my custom message right so just
06:29 - go to the same configuration my message
06:33 - and just paste this message in the log
06:36 - tag category okay and just click
06:41 - okay now uh what we are going to do is
06:44 - we will run our Android application once
06:47 - again and you can choose your uh tag by
06:52 - filtering here so this is my custom
06:54 - message you can choose your custom
06:56 - message from here I will click okay to
06:58 - run the emulator and just choose this uh
07:02 - tag which you have created here okay so
07:04 - my message was my custom uh tag and when
07:09 - it runs uh suddenly it goes so once
07:12 - again choose this my message and let's
07:15 - see what happens whenever you create
07:18 - your or whenever you run your Android
07:20 - application so you can see first method
07:23 - which is called is on create method
07:26 - which is this one then on start method
07:30 - then on a resume method in here once
07:34 - again and then slowly whenever you go
07:38 - down then it's called on Save instance
07:42 - and then you can see all the methods are
07:46 - called one by one on start on resume on
07:49 - pause right so you can see the sequence
07:52 - of these messages in the same man manner
07:56 - now once you uh you know you know click
08:00 - this button this message will be to
08:04 - destroy the application because it it's
08:06 - closed and now whenever we want to run
08:09 - our application from here it will we
08:12 - will just click our application name and
08:15 - it will be created okay and when we
08:18 - click this button our application is not
08:21 - um destroyed or closed but it's paused
08:25 - okay and you can go to uh the other
08:28 - application but but the last application
08:30 - is not destroyed so it's paused and it's
08:33 - it's stopped last message is paus and
08:36 - stopped but it's not destroyed right so
08:39 - whenever you want to open your
08:41 - application once again you can just uh
08:44 - go to this application double click this
08:47 - and it's it res resumes itself so it's
08:50 - not created once again but it resumes
08:55 - itself once again you see resume okay
08:59 - so in this way you can play with your
09:03 - app close it and rerun it and see what
09:06 - messages uh are printed here and this
09:09 - will give you uh the more clear overview
09:12 - of uh this uh these method how they are
09:16 - called and in what sequence they are
09:19 - called so I hope you enjoyed this video
09:22 - please wrate comment and subscribe and
09:24 - bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in the last video we have seen the basic overview of Android activity life cycle now in order to understand this activity life cycle in a more deeper sense we will take an example which will show how these U activity methods will be called in some order so in the last video I have shown you in this main activity uh. Java file there is a method called oncreate which uh is called first whenever you launch your application right and I have shown you uh a diagram like this uh which shows the order of the calling of this method one by one whenever your activi is launched two activity is running two activity is shut down so we will try to call all these method one by one and we will see how uh these method are called in order right so what we are going to do is in our main or main activity. Java class we are going to import one more Library so import Port Android dot util dot. log okay so just uh add the this um library and this is just for logging uh messages to your console here okay so we will log some messages while calling uh these uh methods and we will see uh which method uh is you know logged first so that we know that this is called first and then other method and then other meod and then uh we will uh just make a string so public static final then and we will name our string so string and the name of the string for example my my tag because we are going to uh use tags and then we will just name our string something so for example we uh name our tag as my custom message okay and now to log this what you can do is is you can just call log in your on create method so this is my on create method inside my on create method I will write log dot i and then my tag name so my tag name is this one comma the message I want to display so I want to display for example I for the first time when it's called I want to call this on create method okay so this is simple uh you know logging messages whenever this uh method is called now we want uh you know every method here so on create on start on resume so you can do the same for every method on create or and then you can just copy this and paste it and then do it for on start so this I have done or I have uhu uh you know written in my blog all the method which you can call on start on resume on pause on stop all these method which are called here right so that you don't have to you know uh rewrite this code you can just go to my blog and just see this code and you can copy uh all the code up till on Destroy method and this is the whole uh code of this Java file which I'm using right now here okay so you you just need to copy this from on start to on Destroy okay and all the you know uh library is imported here log util and this is just the same example I'm going to show you so I'm going to copy this and paste it here in order to save the time now once you have uh copied and pasted all the method these are the method which are same as on create so on create on start on resume on pause which are listed in this diagram right and now what we are going to do is in order to display these messages what we are going to do is first of all uh uh go to your activity _ main XML file and in here in the console you can customize your messages so just go to this little combo box here and just uh right click or click added filter configurations and you can uh use your own configuration for example I want to make my uh custom message for example or my uh messages okay so I made my own uh uh own uh message configuration and then I can use the tag here so my tag was my custom message right so in here you can see in this the tag name was my custom message or in my activity you can see the tag name was my custom message right so just go to the same configuration my message and just paste this message in the log tag category okay and just click okay now uh what we are going to do is we will run our Android application once again and you can choose your uh tag by filtering here so this is my custom message you can choose your custom message from here I will click okay to run the emulator and just choose this uh tag which you have created here okay so my message was my custom uh tag and when it runs uh suddenly it goes so once again choose this my message and let's see what happens whenever you create your or whenever you run your Android application so you can see first method which is called is on create method which is this one then on start method then on a resume method in here once again and then slowly whenever you go down then it's called on Save instance and then you can see all the methods are called one by one on start on resume on pause right so you can see the sequence of these messages in the same man manner now once you uh you know you know click this button this message will be to destroy the application because it it's closed and now whenever we want to run our application from here it will we will just click our application name and it will be created okay and when we click this button our application is not um destroyed or closed but it's paused okay and you can go to uh the other application but but the last application is not destroyed so it's paused and it's it's stopped last message is paus and stopped but it's not destroyed right so whenever you want to open your application once again you can just uh go to this application double click this and it's it res resumes itself so it's not created once again but it resumes itself once again you see resume okay so in this way you can play with your app close it and rerun it and see what messages uh are printed here and this will give you uh the more clear overview of uh this uh these method how they are called and in what sequence they are called so I hope you enjoyed this video
