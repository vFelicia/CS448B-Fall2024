00:00 - hello guys in this video to show you how
00:02 - you can download and install MongoDB on
00:05 - your Ubuntu operating system so first of
00:08 - all open your terminal and MongoDB is
00:11 - the part of open to repositories so you
00:14 - just need to give this command sudo apt
00:19 - - get install MongoDB ok and when you
00:28 - give this command it's going to ask for
00:30 - your password just give you a password
00:32 - and then press enter and then the
00:35 - installation of MongoDB will start you
00:37 - just need to click why to allow the you
00:41 - know download and then just wait for
00:45 - some time
00:46 - unless this process is complete and once
00:49 - this process is complete we are going to
00:52 - see the next step
00:55 - so now MongoDB is installed in my system
00:58 - one more command we need to give here is
01:01 - sudo apt-get update so just write sudo
01:06 - apt - get up date and press Enter
01:11 - so that all the repositories related to
01:14 - MongoDB are you know updated now once
01:18 - the update is complete you just need to
01:21 - start MongoDB service so you can just
01:24 - write sudo service DB start so
01:29 -  DB start ok and press enter and it
01:36 - says MongoDB a job is already running so
01:40 - whenever MongoDB is installed on your
01:42 - system it already starts this MongoDB
01:46 - you know job on your system so if in
01:50 - case this job is not started this
01:53 - command is going to start this MongoDB
01:57 - job in background in your computer now
02:02 - once this is done we are ready to use
02:05 - MongoDB so let's see how we can you know
02:09 - work with the MongoDB shell but now what
02:12 - I'm going to do
02:13 - I'm going to just clear everything so
02:17 - just right here and placenta and now I'm
02:21 - going to give this command which is
02:22 -  so just give command and now
02:26 - you can see we are inside the
02:29 - shell the first command we can give here
02:35 - is show DB's which is going to give the
02:39 - databases which we already have so just
02:43 - right show DBS and it's going to give
02:46 - you this result this is the default
02:49 - database which is already present in
02:51 - MongoDB and if you want to create a new
02:55 - database you just need to just write use
02:59 - and your database name for example my DB
03:03 - and what this is going to do is let's
03:06 - give the command first and what is going
03:09 - to do is it's going to create this
03:12 - database if it's not present otherwise
03:16 - if this database is present then this
03:19 - will be switched to this database so
03:23 - right now we are inside this my DB
03:27 - database it has created the database for
03:30 - us because there was no database called
03:33 - my DB but it if this database was
03:37 - present then we will be switched to this
03:40 - database now to print this database or
03:44 - print the current database we are in you
03:47 - just need to write DB and then give this
03:50 - command and it shows my DB that means we
03:54 - are inside this database and we are
03:58 - ready to work with this database now in
04:01 - order to insert some collections and
04:05 - documents inside DB what we can do
04:10 - is we can just write DB DB is the
04:13 - current database so you don't need to
04:16 - write the database name but the DB
04:20 - keyword indicates the current database
04:23 - and then you need to give the collection
04:26 - name
04:26 - so if you know that MongoDB is not a
04:30 - relational database it's a no SQL
04:32 - database and it's based upon collections
04:35 - and documents so to add a collection you
04:39 - need to just write DB dot your
04:42 - collection name for example my call for
04:46 - my collection and then dot insert to
04:51 - insert the document inside the
04:53 - collection right and then give this
04:56 - round brackets and inside the round
04:59 - bracket give these curly brackets
05:01 - because MongoDB tates its document in
05:05 - the form of JSON in a key value pair so
05:09 - inside this curly bracket we can give a
05:11 - key value pair for example name
05:14 - something like this and then colon and
05:17 - then the name of the person for example
05:21 - mark okay and then give this command
05:25 - press ENTER and now this collection is
05:29 - created inside your/my DB database and
05:32 - we have one document inside your
05:36 - collection which is my call now once
05:39 - again when you give show DB command here
05:42 - you can just hit the UP button and it's
05:45 - going to browse through this show DB
05:49 - command and press ENTER and now you can
05:52 - see you have two databases and if you
05:56 - want to you know see the collection
06:00 - inside your database you just need to
06:03 - give this command show
06:04 - collections and then press ENTER and it
06:08 - shows the collections inside your
06:11 - databases right so in here Michael call
06:15 - is the collection which is created by me
06:18 - and this one is the default collection
06:22 - we haven't created this but it will show
06:25 - you this thing by default right so this
06:29 - was the collection we have created using
06:31 - this command now to show all the
06:33 - documents inside the collection you just
06:35 - need to give D be dot your collection
06:38 - name for example
06:39 - I call which I have created this
06:42 - collection and then dot find okay and
06:46 - then these round brackets and then give
06:49 - this command and you can see you have
06:51 - one document inside your collection and
06:55 - if you can observe here this ID is
06:59 - automatically generated by MongoDB for
07:02 - your document and this is the unique ID
07:05 - which is created by MongoDB for each
07:09 - document you create so that MongoDB can
07:12 - recognize each document uniquely right
07:16 - so in this way you can download and
07:18 - install MongoDB on your open to
07:21 - operating system I hope you have enjoyed
