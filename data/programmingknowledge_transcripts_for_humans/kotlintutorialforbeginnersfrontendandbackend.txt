00:00 - what is front-end
00:01 - and back-end in any development any kind
00:04 - of development
00:06 - so
00:08 - i'll just explain you
00:10 - suppose this is a mobile screen
00:12 - okay so whatever we see written in as a
00:15 - text or
00:17 - as a user interface
00:18 - that is the front end part
00:21 - and
00:22 - when we
00:24 - suppose click a button
00:26 - or refresh the screen so whatever
00:28 - happens in the
00:31 - back end
00:32 - whatever happens that we cannot see
00:34 - suppose
00:35 - we have a page it says username password
00:39 - and a login button so when we hit the
00:41 - login button
00:42 - and we
00:44 - get to the next
00:46 - screen
00:48 - so the next screen also
00:50 - includes some user interface so that is
00:52 - the front end of the next screen and the
00:55 - process by which we get to the net next
01:00 - screen
01:01 - is called the back end of the
01:07 - development okay so for front end
01:10 - the front end of a software program or
01:11 - website is everything with which the
01:14 - users and user interact so
01:16 - uh from a user standpoint the front end
01:19 - is a synonymous of user interface
01:21 - whatever i am interacting with is front
01:23 - end from a developer standpoint the
01:25 - interface design and programming that
01:27 - makes the function interface
01:30 - so
01:31 - the design of the
01:34 - of the user interface or the interface
01:37 - function and the program that makes the
01:39 - interface function is the front end
01:41 - okay i hope that's clear
01:43 - so the element of front-end enclosed
01:45 - what what does front-end include the
01:47 - front-end includes application or the
01:50 - page layout so the layout
01:52 - of the application the text content
01:54 - present in the application the images
01:57 - the graphics present in the application
01:58 - the user interface of elements such as
02:00 - button toolbar edit text edit text is
02:04 - the
02:05 - you have you see in the block right
02:08 - to enter the email so that call that is
02:11 - called the adjectives we will uh
02:13 - look into more
02:15 - as you proceed through the course
02:17 - the themes and the customization these
02:19 - all are the part of front-end
02:22 - so what is back-end
02:23 - in the computer world the back-end
02:26 - refers to
02:27 - any part of website or software program
02:31 - that users do not see what i do not see
02:33 - is the back-end it contrasts with the
02:35 - front end so it goes side by side with
02:38 - the front end which refers to the
02:40 - program's website programs or websites
02:42 - user interfaces the front end okay in
02:45 - programming technology the back end is
02:47 - the data access layer while the front
02:49 - end is the presentation layer
02:52 - so what it means is
02:54 - the presentation layer is like
02:56 - what what is presented is the front end
03:00 - and the accessing of data
03:02 - like when i entered the email on the
03:04 - password the data is accessed so that is
03:07 - the back end
03:09 - what is the back-end processes
03:12 - the back-end processes includes
03:14 - processing request when a button is
03:16 - clicked so when i click the button the
03:18 - request which are processed comes in
03:21 - back and part the encrypting and
03:23 - decrypting of data
03:26 - the accessing accessing data from a
03:28 - database so when i
03:32 - enter my user id and password
03:34 - the data is
03:36 - encrypted
03:38 - and then
03:39 - the data is checked from the database so
03:42 - the data is accessed from the database
03:43 - and matched if if there is a match or
03:47 - not
03:48 - uh storing and uploading a data to a
03:50 - database so when i
03:52 - create a new account or sign on to a
03:56 - particular website
03:57 - we store the data data to the database
04:00 - so these all comes in the
04:03 - backend part
04:06 - so what are what is front end back end
04:08 - in android app development
04:11 - so
04:12 - the language used i am mainly talking
04:14 - about c plus plus java and kotlin can be
04:17 - used for the backend part
04:19 - and xml is used for the front-end part
04:23 - in android app development
04:25 - so we will use kotlin in this training
04:29 - so why we will use scotland in this
04:30 - training is a quarter line is a cross
04:32 - platform
04:34 - statistically type
04:35 - general purpose programming
04:37 - language with type inference i will
04:39 - explaining all these terms later so just
04:42 - hang on kotlin is designed to
04:44 - incorporate fully with java and the jvm
04:46 - version of kotlin's standard library
04:49 - depends on the java class library
04:51 - so just sit tight for these
04:56 - terms
04:57 - in may 2019 google announced that the
05:00 - kotlin programming language is now
05:02 - preferred language for android app
05:04 - developers so
05:05 - kotlin is a preferred language
05:07 - so
05:08 - we will look into basic syntax of kotlin
05:11 - so the basic syntax of cordless looks
05:12 - like fun main it is a function
05:15 - and the name of function is main and
05:18 - then it is there is open and close
05:19 - parenthesis
05:21 - and the function
05:22 - opens it is like print helen
05:24 - print ellen hello world
05:27 - i will explaining this
05:29 - function into detail
05:31 - in some next videos it is just a
05:32 - overview
05:34 - so
05:36 - for the front end we will using we will
05:38 - be using xml so xml is a
05:41 - is the extensive extensible markup
05:43 - language the full form of xml is
05:46 - extensible markup language xml is a
05:48 - markup language that is reduce tags
05:52 - so you might have heard about open tag
05:54 - close tag
05:56 - so it is a markup language
05:58 - xml was designed to store and transport
06:01 - data
06:03 - so it is designed to store and transport
06:05 - the data
06:07 - xml was designed to be self descriptive
06:09 - so when we will look into the xml part
06:11 - we will find that it is a self it is
06:13 - self descriptive we
06:15 - we we don't have to describe the
06:18 - code
06:20 - okay xml is a w3c recommendation
06:23 - okay
06:24 - so now we look into the
06:26 - syntax of xml so this is the opening tag
06:29 - so we have opened a tag root
06:32 - and this we have opened a tag child
06:34 - in this we have a text sub child
06:36 - and then
06:37 - we have some code and then we close the
06:40 - text of child and then we close the
06:42 - child's child and then we close the tag
06:44 - root
06:45 - so
06:46 - we have learned about opening tag and
06:48 - closing tag
06:50 - now what what are attributes so
06:53 - attributes are the
06:56 - the uh definition of a tag
06:58 - like
06:59 - there is a person whose gender is female
07:02 - so we will define the attributes in the
07:04 - opening tag itself like here
07:07 - root
07:08 - then gender equals to female so person
07:10 - and gender equals to female these are
07:12 - the attributes
07:13 - so thank you for watching this video
07:15 - stay tuned

what is frontend and backend in any development any kind of development so i'll just explain you suppose this is a mobile screen okay so whatever we see written in as a text or as a user interface

that makes the function interface so the design of the of the user interface or the interface function and the program that makes the interface function is the front end okay i hope that's clear so the element of frontend enclosed what what does frontend include the frontend includes application or the page layout so the layout of the application the text content present in the application the images the graphics present in the application the user interface of elements such as button toolbar edit text edit text is the you have you see in the block right to enter the email so that call that
