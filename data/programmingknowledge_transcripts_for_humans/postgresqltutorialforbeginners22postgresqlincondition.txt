00:00 - special programming knowledge in this
00:02 - video we will see how we can specify
00:04 - multiple values in select statement so
00:08 - first of all open your terminal okay by
00:17 - P is given and now let us see which are
00:25 - the databases present in our system for
00:28 - that right index less here you can see
00:33 - we have tested a bit so we are just want
00:36 - to use that for connecting that test
00:39 - database but let's let's see for connect
00:42 - and test now we are connected to paste
00:47 - out of it so let us see now which are
00:50 - the tables presenting this database for
00:53 - that type X less T we have employee
00:58 - table and preventable so let us see the
01:02 - structure of run table first
01:06 - okay so we have roll number and name
01:09 - here and student table is the primary
01:16 - key roll number okay so let us see the
01:21 - data present in front of L select from
01:28 - student so we have five rows here so let
01:35 - us consider a scenario where I want the
01:39 - data of the student which is roll number
01:42 - of either 1 0 1 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so how we
01:50 - can write it okay so let us try the
01:54 - method which we learn earlier okay
02:10 - well to whom one or condition is equal
02:19 - to okay so we get these three grows
02:31 - because this straight rodent hair is
02:34 - roll number either 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or x
02:38 - look at this condition it's
02:42 - unnecessarily you know because we
02:44 - specify our own number three times here
02:47 - so how we can get rid of this there's an
02:52 - elegant solution for that
02:53 - alright select and you specify okay so
03:19 - this looks more readable and it is much
03:23 - smaller than the previous one and the
03:27 - upper with the same
03:29 - it really gives us the data where
03:32 - student has roll number either 1 0 1 1 0
03:37 - 3 4 1 0 5 so let us close the terminal
03:41 - and open peach ami in this database open
03:47 - 32 this time we will use employee table
03:53 - square employee table has to follow
03:55 - employee ID in a premium so we have 4
04:07 - rows here
04:09 - employee ID is 1 2 3 4 I want to select
04:14 - the employees whose employee ID are
04:18 - either 1 or 4
04:20 - okay so we can like like ntid liquid
04:30 - bunny or PID before you can see the our
04:40 - food consists of two rows Mia and okay
04:46 - we can write it in another matter where
04:55 - he IDs we specify in p1 in and then we
05:02 - specify the way the output will be the
05:06 - same
05:07 - before Toros yeah and so this is how can
05:13 - you in keyword to specify multiple
05:16 - values in select way and you can specify
05:21 - as many as values if you want okay
05:24 - it is fine one more example so that you
05:27 - can a clear idea about it so let us try
05:31 - this feed another table a new
05:34 - development so feed table name of the
05:40 - table will be less than mobile first of
05:46 - all ID of the mobile this will yield
05:49 - company primary key will be ideal so
06:12 - whatever is created let us see slightly
06:15 - refresh as you can see we have mobile
06:19 - column ID n company okay
06:25 - let us accept some values
07:25 - so we have inserted four rows let us see
07:39 - here is our data now I want to select
07:44 - the body whose ID is 1 0 1 1 0 C and
07:49 - wonderful I don't want it 1 0 2 samsung
07:52 - okay so I write select ID in then we
08:12 - specify the multiple value 1 0 1 as you
08:22 - can see we have this data which has CIT
08:27 - of 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or 1 0 4 we can also
08:32 - specify T 1 0 2 then we get all the data
08:37 - ok we can also specify the
08:41 - follow me I want only the company as you
08:46 - can see so that's it this is Duncan
08:52 - specify multiple values in order to find
08:56 - the beta so thanks for watching

special programming knowledge in this video we will see how we can specify multiple values in select statement so first of all open your terminal okay by P is given and now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right index less here you can see we have tested a bit so we are just want to use that for connecting that test database but let's let's see for connect and test now we are connected to paste out of it so let us see now which are the tables presenting this database for that type X less T we have employee table and preventable so let us see the structure of run table first okay so we have roll number and name here and student table is the primary key roll number okay so let us see the data present in front of L select from student so we have five rows here so let us consider a scenario where I want the data of the student which is roll number of either 1 0 1 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so how we can write it okay so let us try the method which we learn earlier okay well to whom one or condition is equal to okay so we get these three grows because this straight rodent hair is roll number either 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or x look at this condition it's unnecessarily you know because we specify our own number three times here so how we can get rid of this there's an elegant solution for that alright select and you specify okay so this looks more readable and it is much smaller than the previous one and the upper with the same it really gives us the data where student has roll number either 1 0 1 1 0 3 4 1 0 5 so let us close the terminal and open peach ami in this database open 32 this time we will use employee table square employee table has to follow employee ID in a premium so we have 4 rows here employee ID is 1 2 3 4 I want to select the employees whose employee ID are either 1 or 4 okay so we can like like ntid liquid bunny or PID before you can see the our food consists of two rows Mia and okay we can write it in another matter where he IDs we specify in p1 in and then we specify the way the output will be the same before Toros yeah and so this is how can you in keyword to specify multiple values in select way and you can specify as many as values if you want okay it is fine one more example so that you can a clear idea about it so let us try this feed another table a new development so feed table name of the table will be less than mobile first of all ID of the mobile this will yield company primary key will be ideal so whatever is created let us see slightly refresh as you can see we have mobile column ID n company okay let us accept some values so we have inserted four rows let us see here is our data now I want to select the body whose ID is 1 0 1 1 0 C and wonderful I don't want it 1 0 2 samsung okay so I write select ID in then we specify the multiple value 1 0 1 as you can see we have this data which has CIT of 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or 1 0 4 we can also specify T 1 0 2 then we get all the data ok we can also specify the follow me I want only the company as you can see so that's it this is Duncan specify multiple values in order to find the beta so thanks for watching
