00:00 - hello everyone welcome to altrix
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:05 - see the three most important tools in
00:08 - the data preparation tab of altrix the
00:11 - first tool that we are going to see is
00:13 - the unique tool
00:14 - as the name suggests
00:16 - unique is used to distinguish that
00:18 - whether a data record is unique or if it
00:21 - is duplicate by grouping on one or more
00:24 - specified fields
00:26 - then uh it sorts those fields so if you
00:28 - want some of the fields to be unique
00:30 - then you can simply check it using this
00:32 - unique tool
00:33 - that whether the particular field or
00:37 - particular column is actually containing
00:39 - unique values or not
00:41 - so how can we use it let's just get this
00:43 - tool
00:44 - uh just like the filter tool we have
00:46 - used the unique tool also has three
00:48 - anchors one is the anchor where it gets
00:50 - the data the next two anchors are the
00:52 - unique and the duplicate anchors as you
00:54 - can see the u and the d
00:57 - so it basically shows you that which of
01:00 - the values are unique and which of them
01:01 - are not okay
01:03 - now this is the configuration panel from
01:05 - where you can just select the values
01:07 - like i would select the customer name
01:10 - i want to check that if the customer is
01:12 - returning to me or not
01:14 - so if i just click on run
01:16 - then
01:18 - okay
01:19 - i'm getting uh some of the unique values
01:21 - so there are 409 records where the
01:23 - customer name is unique so there are 409
01:26 - unique customers i'm also getting
01:29 - duplicates that means the customers we
01:31 - have are the returning customers and now
01:34 - all of these values are grouped together
01:35 - as a customer name like first you can
01:37 - see aaron bergman so the customer uh
01:41 - whatever purchases the customer has made
01:44 - is being grouped together by his name
01:46 - then
01:47 - by the second customer third customer
01:49 - and so on okay so these are the uni
01:51 - customers the total of 409 customers are
01:53 - there and they're returning to me again
01:55 - and again to purchase a total of 10 000
01:58 - uh record items okay so this is what the
02:02 - unique tool helps us to understand about
02:04 - the data now you have applied it on one
02:07 - field but if you want you can apply it
02:09 - on multiple fields like for the category
02:11 - also i want to apply
02:13 - then click on run
02:15 - now what will happen is
02:17 - we would be getting the unique values
02:19 - for
02:21 - uh the combination of both right so now
02:24 - the in the unique value over here the
02:27 - total of 1136 records have been
02:29 - displayed the customer name uh if they
02:32 - have purchased from each of these
02:33 - categories right so in the category
02:35 - there are these three categories
02:37 - furniture of a supply sign technology
02:38 - and the customer name as you can see
02:41 - is same
02:43 - for the three and the remaining are the
02:45 - duplicates which means the customer has
02:47 - made another purchase in the same
02:49 - category of the items so this is the
02:51 - usage of the unique tool okay
02:54 - now let's move on to the next tool that
02:56 - is the imputation tool now what is the
02:58 - imputation tool
03:01 - imputation tool is used to replace a
03:03 - specified value uh within one or more
03:06 - numeric data fields with another
03:08 - specified value so basically it's used
03:11 - that if your data is inconsistent and
03:13 - contain some of the null values then
03:15 - what you can do is actually clean the
03:17 - data set
03:18 - so you can replace the null values with
03:21 - either the average of the values of that
03:23 - particular column or
03:25 - um basically with any value that you
03:27 - want okay so let's just get the
03:29 - imputation tool to get a better look at
03:31 - how it works
03:33 - over here
03:34 - so here you would get the fields which
03:36 - you want to impute now only the numeric
03:38 - fields would be there because that's
03:40 - what we get for the imputation tool now
03:43 - what value you want to replace if there
03:45 - are null values you can replace those
03:47 - null values but if the null values are
03:48 - not present then you can use a user
03:51 - specified value next we have is the
03:53 - replace with value that is with which
03:55 - value you want to replace it so average
03:57 - that means average of all values not
03:59 - including the incoming values to replace
04:02 - okay so basically
04:03 - the values that are already existing
04:05 - those average would be taken and that
04:07 - would be replaced in place of null
04:09 - values we have a median value that is
04:11 - the value separating the higher half
04:12 - from the lower half or the middle value
04:15 - we have the mode value that
04:16 - the value that appears most often
04:19 - or if you want to use a specified value
04:21 - that you want to replace that you can do
04:23 - okay so what i'm going to do is actually
04:25 - just work for the
04:27 - quantity part over here
04:29 - since i know that my data set is clean
04:31 - it has no null values so i'm just going
04:33 - to check a user specified value of 7
04:36 - and i'm going to specify another value
04:38 - for it that is going to be 8 okay that's
04:41 - a minor change that i'm just going to do
04:43 - of course it would be undone because it
04:45 - has no meaning it's just to show you the
04:47 - usage of this tool
04:49 - next we have these two check boxes that
04:50 - is include imputed value in the
04:52 - indicator field that means there would
04:54 - be a field that would be added to
04:56 - specify whether or not a value has been
04:58 - imputed
04:59 - or you want to output the imputed value
05:01 - in a separate field that means the
05:03 - original field would be as it is but in
05:06 - a separate field the value would be
05:08 - outputted the imputed value okay so
05:10 - first of all let's just select the first
05:12 - option and run it to see how it works
05:16 - here it would take few seconds and then
05:22 - let's just see if it has worked for the
05:25 - quantity
05:26 - so now here we can see that um
05:28 - it's eight and the quantity indicator is
05:32 - showing one that means the change has
05:33 - been made over here and on the rest of
05:36 - the values it's showing 0 again it's
05:38 - showing 1 that means the value was
05:39 - originally 7 but now it has been changed
05:41 - to 8.
05:43 - so this is how the imputed value
05:45 - indicator field works next option is the
05:47 - output imputed values as a separate
05:49 - field so we can just select this option
05:51 - and click on run
05:53 - now what would happen is
05:56 - uh we would be getting a separate value
05:58 - in which the quantity value original
06:01 - field would be as it is like here it was
06:03 - seven but in the new values the field
06:05 - would uh new field the values would be
06:07 - eight over here from seven it changed to
06:10 - eight so this is how the imputation
06:12 - works but
06:14 - uh if the null values are present on
06:16 - your data or if you want to replace of
06:17 - any of the values numeric values only
06:19 - then you can use this imputation tool
06:22 - right
06:23 - now last but not the least we have the
06:25 - multi-field binning tool now what is
06:27 - this tool
06:30 - it is actually used to replicate some of
06:33 - the functionality of the tile tool okay
06:37 - basically it allows the data to be
06:39 - binned on multiple fields
06:42 - mainly it is used for the predictive
06:44 - tool set
06:46 - multi-field billing tool accepts only
06:49 - the numeric fields just like the
06:50 - imputation tool we have just seen
06:53 - for the purpose of pinning we can pin
06:56 - the fields either
06:57 - in the form of the equal records or
06:59 - equal intervals so what is a bin uh
07:03 - if you just take a look at a histogram
07:05 - let's just bring up a histogram here
07:08 - right so this is a histogram and as you
07:11 - can see it shows the salary
07:14 - and the number of the players
07:16 - so 0 to 10 is actually an interval 10 to
07:20 - 20 is an interval right so
07:23 - this is called a bin histogram is
07:26 - depicted using bins and in order to
07:29 - create those bins
07:31 - we are going to use the multi-field
07:33 - binning tool in ultrix so let's see how
07:35 - it works
07:36 - uh let's just get this
07:39 - over here
07:41 - and it would get all the numeric fields
07:43 - i am going to do it on the basis of the
07:45 - sales
07:46 - the number of the tiles or the bins that
07:48 - you want to create so i want to create
07:50 - it 10
07:52 - tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two
07:55 - options either equal records or equal
07:57 - intervals equal records what it says
07:59 - that the input records are divided into
08:02 - the specified number of pins each bin is
08:04 - assigned to
08:05 - assign the same number of records okay
08:07 - so the number of records would be equal
08:09 - in each bin
08:10 - um then we have equal intervals that
08:13 - means the minimum and the maximum values
08:16 - of the selected fields are determined
08:19 - and the records are assigned based upon
08:21 - these ranges so if we go with equal
08:24 - intervals that would be like more
08:26 - appropriate to get
08:27 - a varied length of the histogram
08:30 - then you can click on run
08:34 - so after a few seconds you would be
08:36 - getting
08:37 - this field
08:42 - uh it's on the base of sales right
08:46 - uh here is the field uh sales style num
08:48 - so what is the tile number
08:50 - right now it's one
08:52 - and as you can see this one has a
08:54 - higher sales value of 1706 that's why
08:57 - it's been assigned to tile 2
08:59 - and just like this if you just scroll
09:01 - over it you will get some other numbers
09:03 - as well
09:05 - so it's 1 2
09:07 - one and two and that was five over here
09:10 - it has a higher range of six thousand
09:12 - that's why it's been given a number five
09:14 - so just like this
09:16 - uh we have binned our sales records if
09:18 - we just get it into equal number of
09:20 - records and click on run so uh the
09:23 - records would be given
09:25 - two different bins
09:27 - uh equally like as you can see the
09:29 - different bins have been assigned
09:32 - the different bins have been assigned to
09:33 - each of these sales values okay
09:36 - so as we have specified 10 so
09:39 - the 10 tiles have been created and the
09:41 - maximum for thousand tiles we can create
09:44 - so any number between
09:46 - 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the
09:49 - function of the multi-field binning tool
09:51 - and these are all the major tools that
09:54 - you need to know about in the
09:56 - preparation group in ultrix that's all
09:58 - for this video and that's all for the
10:00 - preparation tools in alteryx in the next
10:02 - video we would be looking at the other
10:04 - group which is the join group that's all
10:07 - for this video thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to altrix tutorials in this video we are going to see the three most important tools in the data preparation tab of altrix the first tool that we are going to see is the unique tool as the name suggests unique is used to distinguish that whether a data record is unique or if it is duplicate by grouping on one or more specified fields then uh it sorts those fields so if you want some of the fields to be unique then you can simply check it using this unique tool that whether the particular field or particular column is actually containing unique values or not so how can we use it let's just get this tool uh just like the filter tool we have used the unique tool also has three anchors one is the anchor where it gets the data the next two anchors are the unique and the duplicate anchors as you can see the u and the d so it basically shows you that which of the values are unique and which of them are not okay now this is the configuration panel from where you can just select the values like i would select the customer name i want to check that if the customer is returning to me or not so if i just click on run then okay i'm getting uh some of the unique values so there are 409 records where the customer name is unique so there are 409 unique customers i'm also getting duplicates that means the customers we have are the returning customers and now all of these values are grouped together as a customer name like first you can see aaron bergman so the customer uh whatever purchases the customer has made is being grouped together by his name then by the second customer third customer and so on okay so these are the uni customers the total of 409 customers are there and they're returning to me again and again to purchase a total of 10 000 uh record items okay so this is what the unique tool helps us to understand about the data now you have applied it on one field but if you want you can apply it on multiple fields like for the category also i want to apply then click on run now what will happen is we would be getting the unique values for uh the combination of both right so now the in the unique value over here the total of 1136 records have been displayed the customer name uh if they have purchased from each of these categories right so in the category there are these three categories furniture of a supply sign technology and the customer name as you can see is same for the three and the remaining are the duplicates which means the customer has made another purchase in the same category of the items so this is the usage of the unique tool okay now let's move on to the next tool that is the imputation tool now what is the imputation tool imputation tool is used to replace a specified value uh within one or more numeric data fields with another specified value so basically it's used that if your data is inconsistent and contain some of the null values then what you can do is actually clean the data set so you can replace the null values with either the average of the values of that particular column or um basically with any value that you want okay so let's just get the imputation tool to get a better look at how it works over here so here you would get the fields which you want to impute now only the numeric fields would be there because that's what we get for the imputation tool now what value you want to replace if there are null values you can replace those null values but if the null values are not present then you can use a user specified value next we have is the replace with value that is with which value you want to replace it so average that means average of all values not including the incoming values to replace okay so basically the values that are already existing those average would be taken and that would be replaced in place of null values we have a median value that is the value separating the higher half from the lower half or the middle value we have the mode value that the value that appears most often or if you want to use a specified value that you want to replace that you can do okay so what i'm going to do is actually just work for the quantity part over here since i know that my data set is clean it has no null values so i'm just going to check a user specified value of 7 and i'm going to specify another value for it that is going to be 8 okay that's a minor change that i'm just going to do of course it would be undone because it has no meaning it's just to show you the usage of this tool next we have these two check boxes that is include imputed value in the indicator field that means there would be a field that would be added to specify whether or not a value has been imputed or you want to output the imputed value in a separate field that means the original field would be as it is but in a separate field the value would be outputted the imputed value okay so first of all let's just select the first option and run it to see how it works here it would take few seconds and then let's just see if it has worked for the quantity so now here we can see that um it's eight and the quantity indicator is showing one that means the change has been made over here and on the rest of the values it's showing 0 again it's showing 1 that means the value was originally 7 but now it has been changed to 8. so this is how the imputed value indicator field works next option is the output imputed values as a separate field so we can just select this option and click on run now what would happen is uh we would be getting a separate value in which the quantity value original field would be as it is like here it was seven but in the new values the field would uh new field the values would be eight over here from seven it changed to eight so this is how the imputation works but uh if the null values are present on your data or if you want to replace of any of the values numeric values only then you can use this imputation tool right now last but not the least we have the multifield binning tool now what is this tool it is actually used to replicate some of the functionality of the tile tool okay basically it allows the data to be binned on multiple fields mainly it is used for the predictive tool set multifield billing tool accepts only the numeric fields just like the imputation tool we have just seen for the purpose of pinning we can pin the fields either in the form of the equal records or equal intervals so what is a bin uh if you just take a look at a histogram let's just bring up a histogram here right so this is a histogram and as you can see it shows the salary and the number of the players so 0 to 10 is actually an interval 10 to 20 is an interval right so this is called a bin histogram is depicted using bins and in order to create those bins we are going to use the multifield binning tool in ultrix so let's see how it works uh let's just get this over here and it would get all the numeric fields i am going to do it on the basis of the sales the number of the tiles or the bins that you want to create so i want to create it 10 tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two options either equal records or equal intervals equal records what it says that the input records are divided into the specified number of pins each bin is assigned to assign the same number of records okay so the number of records would be equal in each bin um then we have equal intervals that means the minimum and the maximum values of the selected fields are determined and the records are assigned based upon these ranges so if we go with equal intervals that would be like more appropriate to get a varied length of the histogram then you can click on run so after a few seconds you would be getting this field uh it's on the base of sales right uh here is the field uh sales style num so what is the tile number right now it's one and as you can see this one has a higher sales value of 1706 that's why it's been assigned to tile 2 and just like this if you just scroll over it you will get some other numbers as well so it's 1 2 one and two and that was five over here it has a higher range of six thousand that's why it's been given a number five so just like this uh we have binned our sales records if we just get it into equal number of records and click on run so uh the records would be given two different bins uh equally like as you can see the different bins have been assigned the different bins have been assigned to each of these sales values okay so as we have specified 10 so the 10 tiles have been created and the maximum for thousand tiles we can create so any number between 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the function of the multifield binning tool and these are all the major tools that you need to know about in the preparation group in ultrix that's all for this video and that's all for the preparation tools in alteryx in the next video we would be looking at the other group which is the join group that's all for this video thanks for watching
