00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:06 - create your first class in Python now if
00:10 - you haven't seen my last video in which
00:13 - I have discussed what is object-oriented
00:16 - programming and what are classes I will
00:19 - highly recommend you to watch that video
00:22 - because this will be a continuation of
00:24 - that video so let's create a class in
00:29 - Python so for that I will create a new
00:32 - project so let's create a new project in
00:35 - PyCharm so just click on file here and
00:38 - then click on new project and then the
00:41 - project name I'm going to give here is
00:43 - oops
00:44 - and then I will just click on create and
00:47 - I will choose this option which says
00:50 - open in current window and also this
00:53 - option which is added to currently open
00:56 - the project which is going to create
00:58 - this project in this window itself which
01:01 - is already open so now you can see we
01:04 - have our empty project here and inside
01:08 - this project let's create a Python file
01:10 - so right click on the project and then
01:12 - new and then we are going to create a
01:14 - new file and let's create a class called
01:18 - car so I'm going to name the file name
01:22 - as car because we are going to create
01:25 - the car class now in order to create a
01:29 - class in Python you use a keyword class
01:33 - and then you give the name to your class
01:38 - so the class name in our case is car and
01:40 - then you give the schoolin and for
01:45 - example I write here a keyword called
01:48 - pass now when you write this keyword
01:51 - after the Declaration of a class this
01:55 - means that it is a empty class you can
01:59 - also use the space keyword to create an
02:02 - empty method so this keyword pass is
02:05 - used to create an empty class or an
02:09 - empty
02:10 - method now here after the class
02:12 - declaration let's see how we can create
02:15 - an instance of a class
02:17 - so it's really easy to create an
02:19 - instance of a class so let's create a
02:21 - first object and I'm going to name it as
02:23 - Ford which is a car brand and then you
02:27 - use your car class name and use these
02:31 - parentheses here okay so this here Ford
02:35 - is an object or you can also say it's an
02:39 - instance of that last car in a similar
02:43 - way we can create multiple objects for
02:46 - example Honda is another car brand and
02:50 - you can create the Honda object using
02:54 - this class car once again you can create
02:57 - a new object for example Audie and then
03:00 - you can once again use this car class to
03:04 - create this object so what we have done
03:07 - till now we have created three object
03:10 - from that last car now in the previous
03:13 - video I told you that you can associate
03:16 - some data with your object
03:19 - so let's associate some data so for
03:22 - example Ford we can associate attribute
03:27 - called speed right so we can assign the
03:31 - speed for example 200 here for a Honda
03:36 - we can assign speed let's say 220 and
03:40 - for Adi we can assign the speed let's
03:45 - say 250 so speed here is called the
03:48 - attribute and whenever you create an
03:50 - empty class using this pass keyword you
03:54 - can add these attributes on the fly so
03:58 - you can see we have added these
04:00 - attribute after the Declaration of the
04:03 - class and after the creation of the
04:07 - objects let's add some more attribute to
04:10 - these instances or the object so a car
04:14 - can have the color so I'm going to just
04:17 - write color and the Ford has let's say
04:22 - the
04:22 - my color and let me just copy and paste
04:26 - here and let's say the Honda have the
04:31 - blue color and we have the ADI of black
04:37 - color so once again color is an
04:40 - attribute here if you want to print
04:42 - these attribute you can use this print
04:45 - method and then for example we want to
04:48 - print the speed of Ford and the color of
04:53 - Ford then we can do it like this and
04:57 - let's run the code so in order to run
04:59 - this code first of all when you create a
05:01 - new project and a new python file you
05:04 - need to right click on this file and
05:07 - then click on run the file name whatever
05:11 - is your file name my file name was car
05:13 - so you can see now the result is printed
05:18 - here first is the speed and second is
05:21 - the color of an instance Ford similarly
05:25 - you can print the color and speed of
05:27 - Honda and Audi objects also now if you
05:31 - want to change some attribute it's also
05:34 - possible so let's say I want to change
05:36 - the speed of Ford objects so I'm going
05:40 - to use Ford dot speed once again and
05:44 - this time I want to assign 300 speed to
05:47 - this attribute let's say we also want to
05:50 - change the color of the food objects so
05:55 - I'm going to just use 4 dot color and
05:57 - this time I want to use the color blue
06:01 - here and let's once again we will try to
06:05 - print the color and speed of the object
06:08 - Ford and now you can see this result so
06:13 - before the speed was 200 and the new
06:15 - speed is 300 for the object Ford and
06:18 - before the color was red and the new
06:21 - color is blue for this object Ford now
06:25 - if you have followed the last video this
06:27 - speed and color is the data so speed and
06:31 - color are the variables which holds some
06:34 - data inside them but still we haven't
06:37 - added any behavior or methods to our
06:41 - class car and that we will do in the
06:44 - next video now let's create a new class
06:47 - because understanding classes in any
06:51 - language is difficult so let me give you
06:54 - another example so this time I'm going
06:57 - to create a new Python class and I'm
07:00 - going to name this python class as a
07:03 - rectangle and then press ok which is
07:06 - going to create this class and to create
07:09 - a class you already know you use the
07:11 - keyword and the name of the class and
07:13 - then the colon and we will also make
07:17 - this class an empty class using this
07:20 - path keyboard and in order to create an
07:23 - instance I'm going to just write correct
07:26 - one which is the first object using the
07:30 - rectangle class and then I'm going to
07:33 - create rect 2 which is the second object
07:37 - using this rectangle class and now what
07:42 - are the attributes which we can relate
07:44 - to the rectangle a rectangle have a
07:48 - width and the height so let's add the
07:51 - herebut and height so let me use the
07:54 - first object and let's say height is 24
07:58 - the rectangle 1 and then we are going to
08:01 - use the second object and once again we
08:04 - are going to add the height for the
08:08 - second rectangle let's say the height of
08:10 - second rectangle is 30 similarly we can
08:14 - add the width to the rectangle so width
08:18 - is equal to let's say it's 40 and
08:21 - correct to object have the width let's
08:26 - say 10 so what we have done here we have
08:28 - created a rectangle class and then we
08:32 - have created two instances of the
08:34 - rectangle class correct one and rag2
08:38 - which are also called objects and then
08:41 - we have added some attributes to our
08:44 - objects which are height and
08:47 - with now let's say you want to calculate
08:49 - the area of these two rectangles I can
08:53 - use the print method and then what is
08:55 - the area of the rectangle it's the
08:58 - multiplication of the height and the
09:01 - width right so I can use this rectangle
09:06 - one object and then I can call the
09:10 - height and width of this object and this
09:13 - will give me the area of the rectangle
09:17 - one using this multiplication operator
09:21 - similarly I will do the same for the
09:24 - object to here and let's run the code
09:27 - and if you remember what we need to do
09:29 - if we create a new Python file we need
09:31 - to right-click on the file and then
09:35 - click on run right
09:37 - so once the file is running you can
09:41 - choose from here which file you want to
09:43 - run but at least once you need to
09:45 - right-click on the file and just click
09:48 - on run whatever filename you have so you
09:51 - can see the area of rectangle one is 800
09:55 - and the area of rectangle two is 300 so
09:58 - this is how you can create a very simple
10:01 - class in Python in the next video I'm
10:04 - going to show you how to add behaviors
10:07 - to your class that means how to add
10:09 - methods to your class and how to use
10:12 - this method to manipulate this data
10:15 - which we have provided here in the form
10:18 - of attributes so stay tuned and please
10:21 - keep watching these videos and I will
10:23 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to the next video on python tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first class in Python now if you haven't seen my last video in which I have discussed what is objectoriented programming and what are classes I will highly recommend you to watch that video because this will be a continuation of that video so let's create a class in Python so for that I will create a new project so let's create a new project in PyCharm so just click on file here and then click on new project and then the project name I'm going to give here is oops and then I will just click on create and I will choose this option which says open in current window and also this option which is added to currently open the project which is going to create this project in this window itself which is already open so now you can see we have our empty project here and inside this project let's create a Python file so right click on the project and then new and then we are going to create a new file and let's create a class called car so I'm going to name the file name as car because we are going to create the car class now in order to create a class in Python you use a keyword class and then you give the name to your class so the class name in our case is car and then you give the schoolin and for example I write here a keyword called pass now when you write this keyword after the Declaration of a class this means that it is a empty class you can also use the space keyword to create an empty method so this keyword pass is used to create an empty class or an empty method now here after the class declaration let's see how we can create an instance of a class so it's really easy to create an instance of a class so let's create a first object and I'm going to name it as Ford which is a car brand and then you use your car class name and use these parentheses here okay so this here Ford is an object or you can also say it's an instance of that last car in a similar way we can create multiple objects for example Honda is another car brand and you can create the Honda object using this class car once again you can create a new object for example Audie and then you can once again use this car class to create this object so what we have done till now we have created three object from that last car now in the previous video I told you that you can associate some data with your object so let's associate some data so for example Ford we can associate attribute called speed right so we can assign the speed for example 200 here for a Honda we can assign speed let's say 220 and for Adi we can assign the speed let's say 250 so speed here is called the attribute and whenever you create an empty class using this pass keyword you can add these attributes on the fly so you can see we have added these attribute after the Declaration of the class and after the creation of the objects let's add some more attribute to these instances or the object so a car can have the color so I'm going to just write color and the Ford has let's say the my color and let me just copy and paste here and let's say the Honda have the blue color and we have the ADI of black color so once again color is an attribute here if you want to print these attribute you can use this print method and then for example we want to print the speed of Ford and the color of Ford then we can do it like this and let's run the code so in order to run this code first of all when you create a new project and a new python file you need to right click on this file and then click on run the file name whatever is your file name my file name was car so you can see now the result is printed here first is the speed and second is the color of an instance Ford similarly you can print the color and speed of Honda and Audi objects also now if you want to change some attribute it's also possible so let's say I want to change the speed of Ford objects so I'm going to use Ford dot speed once again and this time I want to assign 300 speed to this attribute let's say we also want to change the color of the food objects so I'm going to just use 4 dot color and this time I want to use the color blue here and let's once again we will try to print the color and speed of the object Ford and now you can see this result so before the speed was 200 and the new speed is 300 for the object Ford and before the color was red and the new color is blue for this object Ford now if you have followed the last video this speed and color is the data so speed and color are the variables which holds some data inside them but still we haven't added any behavior or methods to our class car and that we will do in the next video now let's create a new class because understanding classes in any language is difficult so let me give you another example so this time I'm going to create a new Python class and I'm going to name this python class as a rectangle and then press ok which is going to create this class and to create a class you already know you use the keyword and the name of the class and then the colon and we will also make this class an empty class using this path keyboard and in order to create an instance I'm going to just write correct one which is the first object using the rectangle class and then I'm going to create rect 2 which is the second object using this rectangle class and now what are the attributes which we can relate to the rectangle a rectangle have a width and the height so let's add the herebut and height so let me use the first object and let's say height is 24 the rectangle 1 and then we are going to use the second object and once again we are going to add the height for the second rectangle let's say the height of second rectangle is 30 similarly we can add the width to the rectangle so width is equal to let's say it's 40 and correct to object have the width let's say 10 so what we have done here we have created a rectangle class and then we have created two instances of the rectangle class correct one and rag2 which are also called objects and then we have added some attributes to our objects which are height and with now let's say you want to calculate the area of these two rectangles I can use the print method and then what is the area of the rectangle it's the multiplication of the height and the width right so I can use this rectangle one object and then I can call the height and width of this object and this will give me the area of the rectangle one using this multiplication operator similarly I will do the same for the object to here and let's run the code and if you remember what we need to do if we create a new Python file we need to rightclick on the file and then click on run right so once the file is running you can choose from here which file you want to run but at least once you need to rightclick on the file and just click on run whatever filename you have so you can see the area of rectangle one is 800 and the area of rectangle two is 300 so this is how you can create a very simple class in Python in the next video I'm going to show you how to add behaviors to your class that means how to add methods to your class and how to use this method to manipulate this data which we have provided here in the form of attributes so stay tuned and please keep watching these videos and I will see you in the next video
