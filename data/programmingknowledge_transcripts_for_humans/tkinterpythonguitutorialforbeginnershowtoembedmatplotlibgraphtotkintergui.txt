00:00 - hi guys and welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge in the previous video we
00:04 - learned about how to create a Kelsie
00:07 - application calculator application in
00:09 - kinder iton so now moving on forward or
00:14 - in this video we'll be seeing about how
00:17 - you can integrate a map plot live graph
00:21 - into the kingdom
00:22 - gy so let's begin initially we have to
00:26 - import and make sure that you have the
00:30 - latest version of MATLAB installed
00:32 - within your system so let's begin import
00:37 - into or from mat both live dot backend
00:48 - sorry
00:51 - you
00:54 - bakken's dot black tea okay so back JP
01:05 - in on the score
01:13 - TK see this is the this other sub
01:19 - modules present within my problem to get
01:21 - your graph connected with the kinder
01:25 - interface so this is one now you can use
01:30 - figure this one and for navigation
01:39 - this other like if you have used blood
01:43 - live graph on their own salt navigation
01:45 - options present and the bottom of the
01:49 - graph so those are tadpoles you'll want
01:55 - to and that's it
01:58 - no from mark on live long back and gone
02:11 - back basis so we have back and unless
02:22 - cone basis
02:29 - you know how to use this one weight and
02:35 - there might be an error
02:36 - okay so this is fine import he the same
02:45 - law now from my problem not singer in
02:55 - both Silla
03:02 - you
03:07 - so now we'll be importing using numpy I
03:11 - will I'll be not going into deep numpy
03:14 - not teaching much of non fire on the
03:18 - purpose over here mean is how you can
03:20 - use them graph into on kinder that's it
03:23 - and there will be some mathematical
03:24 - calculations done using
03:26 - numpy so just follow along as NP now
03:34 - creating the kit kinder option the
03:40 - object
03:43 - now board in his title hood
03:50 - underscore title
03:57 - you
04:03 - and okay so I'm reading into whatever
04:10 - you want that is up to you
04:17 - okay so now sigil is available I will be
04:25 - using the figure for warding token was -
04:30 - it say this size is equal to 5 comma 4
04:43 - you
04:45 - and dpi these are the certain operations
04:53 - done for showing the home field or the
04:58 - graph that is being produced within it
05:00 - I'll be not going that much into deep in
05:03 - the math model because my hope is over
05:04 - here is teaching the embedding of window
05:08 - into the math problem so if you want to
05:11 - more in depth of my portal you can watch
05:14 - through the documentation of it and
05:18 - amazing come by service I'll be taking
05:22 - the file over here which I already have
05:33 - okay so this is some mount operation
05:36 - done using numpy and this is a sub
05:41 - function of Matlock that is if you want
05:43 - to add a graph plotting on based on
05:47 - certain operations for example here we
05:49 - are performing certain operations to
05:53 - produce the graph output that is like
05:56 - some numpy operations and this is within
06:00 - the column that if you want to show your
06:04 - graph within a canvas of a kingdom you
06:07 - use that basically it's like a canvas
06:10 - and on that can wash you're using that
06:13 - graph that's it and placing that canvas
06:19 - into a certain position for that we are
06:22 - using this back top so it will be at the
06:26 - right at the top of the window of window
06:29 - and using a navigation toolbar which you
06:32 - already have in the modular we will it
06:36 - will be clear in the output I'll just
06:38 - show you in a minute now we will be
06:41 - creating a button that is on press on
06:50 - the spot here this is the function rest
06:54 - even
07:00 - [Music]
07:12 - Rask
07:14 - you
07:17 - not formal sorry
07:22 - former and the key
07:30 - okay now he underscore personal variable
07:38 - or Candler even comma can loss so we are
07:46 - just basically merging the canvas in a
07:48 - glass and binding it together the
07:51 - toolbar
07:59 - okay so this is done and canvas
08:11 - . and we are
08:15 - or connect with me in the scope press
08:24 - the score even
08:28 - you
08:29 - closing comma and low on scaled
08:39 - you have to check for address - right
08:41 - for this even
08:47 - you
08:50 - yep there is no error until now should
08:53 - be moving on forward and now we will be
08:57 - creating a button within this function
09:02 - quit root God quit the root
09:16 - let's try so this is the function which
09:27 - will be used for quitting the window and
09:30 - I window and binding it with the button
09:36 - kingdom dot button and we will master is
09:50 - equal to root text is equal to you can
09:57 - avoid any text to it and wait in this
10:07 - point a command doing that is the man is
10:12 - equal to quit this packet dot back side
10:29 - is equal to dot bottom and this okay so
10:50 - I guess that should be working fine and
10:54 - let's see yes we do have an error over
11:02 - here so okay this route on here are
11:05 - taking the input so let's just remove
11:08 - one okay there is gone and let's run
11:12 - again
11:16 - on press key is not a fine level okay
11:28 - you
11:32 - okay so the function over here is let's
11:38 - find knowledge see okay so this is how
11:45 - you can integrate a mantle of it in a
11:48 - canvas or the background is a canvas and
11:51 - within that canvas we are plotting the
11:54 - graphs so it is basically a combination
11:58 - of a canvas and the graph getting it on
12:01 - top of it so these are the navigation
12:04 - options so I'll just show you where it
12:06 - exactly is
12:09 - so this cool one navigation toolbar or
12:13 - bouquet is for that option and this is
12:20 - the button placing it into the bottom
12:25 - and if I press on it it quits so this is
12:32 - how this is how you can integrate in my
12:36 - flow graph into filter and this was it
12:39 - for this video guys thanks watchin

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create a Kelsie application calculator application in kinder iton so now moving on forward or in this video we'll be seeing about how you can integrate a map plot live graph into the kingdom gy so let's begin initially we have to import and make sure that you have the latest version of MATLAB installed within your system so let's begin import into or from mat both live dot backend sorry you bakken's dot black tea okay so back JP in on the score TK see this is the this other sub modules present within my problem to get your graph connected with the kinder interface so this is one now you can use figure this one and for navigation this other like if you have used blood live graph on their own salt navigation options present and the bottom of the graph so those are tadpoles you'll want to and that's it no from mark on live long back and gone back basis so we have back and unless cone basis you know how to use this one weight and there might be an error okay so this is fine import he the same law now from my problem not singer in both Silla you so now we'll be importing using numpy I will I'll be not going into deep numpy not teaching much of non fire on the purpose over here mean is how you can use them graph into on kinder that's it and there will be some mathematical calculations done using numpy so just follow along as NP now creating the kit kinder option the object now board in his title hood underscore title you and okay so I'm reading into whatever you want that is up to you okay so now sigil is available I will be using the figure for warding token was it say this size is equal to 5 comma 4 you and dpi these are the certain operations done for showing the home field or the graph that is being produced within it I'll be not going that much into deep in the math model because my hope is over here is teaching the embedding of window into the math problem so if you want to more in depth of my portal you can watch through the documentation of it and amazing come by service I'll be taking the file over here which I already have okay so this is some mount operation done using numpy and this is a sub function of Matlock that is if you want to add a graph plotting on based on certain operations for example here we are performing certain operations to produce the graph output that is like some numpy operations and this is within the column that if you want to show your graph within a canvas of a kingdom you use that basically it's like a canvas and on that can wash you're using that graph that's it and placing that canvas into a certain position for that we are using this back top so it will be at the right at the top of the window of window and using a navigation toolbar which you already have in the modular we will it will be clear in the output I'll just show you in a minute now we will be creating a button that is on press on the spot here this is the function rest even Rask you not formal sorry former and the key okay now he underscore personal variable or Candler even comma can loss so we are just basically merging the canvas in a glass and binding it together the toolbar okay so this is done and canvas . and we are or connect with me in the scope press the score even you closing comma and low on scaled you have to check for address right for this even you yep there is no error until now should be moving on forward and now we will be creating a button within this function quit root God quit the root let's try so this is the function which will be used for quitting the window and I window and binding it with the button kingdom dot button and we will master is equal to root text is equal to you can avoid any text to it and wait in this point a command doing that is the man is equal to quit this packet dot back side is equal to dot bottom and this okay so I guess that should be working fine and let's see yes we do have an error over here so okay this route on here are taking the input so let's just remove one okay there is gone and let's run again on press key is not a fine level okay you okay so the function over here is let's find knowledge see okay so this is how you can integrate a mantle of it in a canvas or the background is a canvas and within that canvas we are plotting the graphs so it is basically a combination of a canvas and the graph getting it on top of it so these are the navigation options so I'll just show you where it exactly is so this cool one navigation toolbar or bouquet is for that option and this is the button placing it into the bottom and if I press on it it quits so this is how this is how you can integrate in my flow graph into filter and this was it for this video guys thanks watchin
