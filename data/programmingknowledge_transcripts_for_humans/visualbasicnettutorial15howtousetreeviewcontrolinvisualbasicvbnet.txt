00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use Tree
00:05 - View control with your Visual Basic
00:07 - Windows P
00:09 - application uh I have already created a
00:11 - sample project and I have taken a button
00:13 - and I have changed it its uh text to add
00:18 - node now um I will go to my toolbox and
00:22 - I will uh search for the tree View and
00:27 - drag and drop into my form so this is a
00:31 - treeview and I drag and drop into my
00:34 - form
00:36 - okay and if you want you can change the
00:40 - name of this treeview to your desired
00:43 - name but I will uh leave it as default
00:46 - which is preview one now I will select
00:51 - this button and I will double click it
00:54 - and in here I have two lines of code
00:57 - already written which is I have declared
01:00 - a string variable which is
01:02 - n and I'm taking a input from my input
01:08 - box and I'm transferring or assigning
01:11 - this input to This n so right now when I
01:16 - run the program and when I press this
01:19 - add node it asks
01:21 - me uh as a input box what I want to
01:25 - enter and when I click okay it assigns
01:29 - what what I have entered to This n
01:32 - variable okay so write these two lines
01:36 - of code
01:37 - to initialize the input box now to add a
01:42 - node to a
01:44 - tree we will uh write first of all the
01:48 - name of our tree view which is Tree View
01:50 - one right Tree View
01:54 - one
01:56 - dot nodes because we are adding the
01:59 - nodes right right dot
02:02 - add okay so add node and what are we
02:07 - going
02:09 - to add here there are two argument
02:13 - basically which this add takes first is
02:18 - the key of this of the tree view node so
02:22 - for example I'm going to give the key
02:25 - the whatever I enter in the input box
02:28 - right so I will pass this n as a first
02:31 - argument and as a second argument also
02:35 - you can see it here if you have this uh
02:39 - description this is taking key as a
02:41 - string and text as a string so second
02:44 - argument is a text as a string okay and
02:49 - right now I'm taking uh the key and text
02:53 - as same so we don't get
02:56 - confused and now when I run the program
03:00 - and when I uh click this add button and
03:04 - I add some text for example some
03:10 - name and once again
03:12 - some
03:15 - name and once again some
03:19 - name so it adds as a node to our tree
03:24 - right we can select it but we haven't
03:28 - included theun functionality for
03:30 - selecting these item so let add let's
03:34 - add the functionality for selecting now
03:38 - after these two lines of code where we
03:40 - have declared the input box just go just
03:43 - go below that and right
03:46 - here if
03:53 - treeview one which is my treeview DOT
03:58 - selected node
04:05 - is
04:08 - nothing
04:10 - then then what I will do is if something
04:13 - is not selected then I will add a new
04:16 - node to the tree view otherwise what I
04:20 - will
04:21 - do else I will
04:24 - write
04:26 - else I will add a sub node or child to
04:30 - the selected node right so I will write
04:36 - Tree View one dot selected node which is
04:42 - the node we have selected dot
04:49 - nodes dot
04:53 - add okay and now we will pass the same
04:58 - to and variable which is the string form
05:02 - from the input box right and now when I
05:05 - run my
05:06 - program I can adds names or nodes as
05:12 - usual second
05:16 - name and the third
05:21 - name but I can add a sub node now when I
05:25 - select any item or any node from here
05:27 - for example I'm selecting this first
05:30 - name which is Mark and now when I add a
05:35 - node
05:36 - Mark is um boy for
05:41 - example so you can see it has created a
05:45 - child to your node okay now I want to
05:50 - add a child to this sub node also then I
05:54 - will
05:57 - say 15
06:04 - your okay so when you select some node
06:08 - it's adding a child to the that node
06:12 - once again right so now you know how to
06:16 - select and how to add a sub child to
06:19 - your tree view now for example you want
06:22 - to add some image to your treeview so I
06:26 - will show you how to add images to your
06:29 - review nodes what you need to do is just
06:33 - select on not select but go to your
06:37 - toolbx and we will use
06:40 - image container or image box or image
06:43 - list from our
06:45 - toolbox search for the image list okay
06:50 - this is the image list drag and drop
06:52 - into your form and you will notice this
06:55 - image list goes down below here what we
06:59 - will do is we will just click this small
07:02 - triangle button from here and we will
07:05 - say choose images okay and in here we
07:09 - can choose images so what we need to do
07:12 - just click this add
07:14 - button and whatever image you want to
07:16 - choose in the list of image so when we
07:20 - drag and drop image list we can choose a
07:24 - list of image and contain this list of
07:28 - image in this image list right for
07:31 - example I choose one two three and four
07:35 - Images right now and I click
07:38 - open and you see all the four Images
07:43 - are there in my image list and if you
07:48 - see it carefully we have the number
07:51 - assigned for these images these are
07:53 - called index of the image list right
07:57 - first image has index zero second has
08:00 - one third has two and fourth has three
08:04 - okay now just click okay and you can set
08:09 - the image size from here
08:11 - also so you see here image size right
08:15 - now is 16 by 16 which is a smaller
08:18 - version of images let's make them bigger
08:22 - for
08:23 - example 32x 32 so we will be able to see
08:28 - the images better
08:30 - or let's make it 64 to make it make the
08:34 - images more
08:36 - bigger 64x 64
08:39 - okay so now you have set that you can
08:44 - also set the depth of the images which
08:48 - I'm leaving as default and now we have
08:52 - the images in the image list now what we
08:55 - need to do is select your tree View and
08:59 - and go to the image collection
09:02 - property okay we have this image list
09:06 - here when you when we select this tree
09:09 - view right so we have image list we
09:12 - select the image list one which is this
09:15 - image list in which we have the images
09:18 - right and so now we have the image list
09:23 - in our
09:25 - treeview let's see once again okay we
09:28 - have the image list right and we have
09:31 - the index for the images which we know
09:35 - now once again I will click this add
09:37 - node button and in here what I just need
09:41 - to do
09:43 - is I need to add
09:46 - extra extra argument to the node so just
09:51 - when you have where you have preview
09:53 - one. node. add and after these two this
09:58 - key and this um text we will make one
10:01 - more argument as image index as you
10:05 - remember image index 0 1 2 3 right so I
10:09 - will give the image index zero and comma
10:14 - selected image index so fourth argument
10:18 - is the selected image index which is one
10:22 - so this will show the image number zero
10:25 - and this will show the image number one
10:28 - right okay here also in the selected
10:31 - image I will add 0 comma 1 okay now when
10:37 - I run the program once again and I want
10:40 - to add a node once
10:44 - again you have this image and you have
10:48 - this name Mark once
10:52 - again some other name you have second
10:55 - name but when you select any
10:59 - any of the node the image changes so
11:03 - this is index number zero which is not
11:06 - selected and this is index number one
11:09 - for the image which is selected right
11:13 - let's add one more
11:18 - node and the same phenomena will occur
11:22 - for this also
11:26 - right so whenever you choose some image
11:29 - it
11:31 - changes according to the
11:33 - selection okay now for example you want
11:36 - to use all the
11:39 - images which is there in the image list
11:41 - one by one so what I will do is once
11:45 - again I will go to the this button
11:47 - double click it we have this code
11:49 - already I will declare outside this
11:52 - method for button click just below this
11:55 - class form one I'll declare dim
12:02 - I
12:06 - as
12:08 - integer is equal to Zer okay so I have
12:13 - declared a variable I which is integer
12:16 - and we will Loop this integer in a loop
12:21 - okay so I will write here
12:29 - I is equal to in the brackets I + 1
12:35 - which will Loop my images and I will say
12:40 - mod four because I have four Images so
12:43 - it will Loop every four Images right and
12:48 - this I I will replace it with these
12:51 - index zero and one so I will say I here
12:54 - I here I will go here and I I will also
12:58 - go here
13:00 - okay so what I have done I have declared
13:03 - this integer and I'm looping this
13:06 - integer one by one in the loop of four
13:10 - and I just replace this index of the
13:14 - image by this integer once again I will
13:18 - run my program add some
13:23 - node and once again add some
13:27 - node and and once again add some
13:33 - node and once again add some node okay
13:38 - so you see whatever images I have
13:41 - selected these all four Images are
13:44 - different but when I now add one more
13:49 - images it will start looping the earlier
13:52 - image so this first image and this last
13:56 - image is same because we only have four
13:59 - four images and it's start looping once
14:04 - again right so now we when we add it
14:07 - will add the second image this image and
14:12 - this image will be same
14:14 - right this image okay or when we add a
14:18 - next
14:20 - image because we have selected this node
14:23 - it will add the next image here so in
14:27 - this way you can Loop your images
14:29 - also so I think you have uh now
14:33 - understood how to use uh Tree View
14:36 - basically with your Visual Basic Windows
14:40 - Form application I hope you have learned
14:42 - something new this time please rate
14:44 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to use Tree View control with your Visual Basic Windows P application uh I have already created a sample project and I have taken a button and I have changed it its uh text to add node now um I will go to my toolbox and I will uh search for the tree View and drag and drop into my form so this is a treeview and I drag and drop into my form okay and if you want you can change the name of this treeview to your desired name but I will uh leave it as default which is preview one now I will select this button and I will double click it and in here I have two lines of code already written which is I have declared a string variable which is n and I'm taking a input from my input box and I'm transferring or assigning this input to This n so right now when I run the program and when I press this add node it asks me uh as a input box what I want to enter and when I click okay it assigns what what I have entered to This n variable okay so write these two lines of code to initialize the input box now to add a node to a tree we will uh write first of all the name of our tree view which is Tree View one right Tree View one dot nodes because we are adding the nodes right right dot add okay so add node and what are we going to add here there are two argument basically which this add takes first is the key of this of the tree view node so for example I'm going to give the key the whatever I enter in the input box right so I will pass this n as a first argument and as a second argument also you can see it here if you have this uh description this is taking key as a string and text as a string so second argument is a text as a string okay and right now I'm taking uh the key and text as same so we don't get confused and now when I run the program and when I uh click this add button and I add some text for example some name and once again some name and once again some name so it adds as a node to our tree right we can select it but we haven't included theun functionality for selecting these item so let add let's add the functionality for selecting now after these two lines of code where we have declared the input box just go just go below that and right here if treeview one which is my treeview DOT selected node is nothing then then what I will do is if something is not selected then I will add a new node to the tree view otherwise what I will do else I will write else I will add a sub node or child to the selected node right so I will write Tree View one dot selected node which is the node we have selected dot nodes dot add okay and now we will pass the same to and variable which is the string form from the input box right and now when I run my program I can adds names or nodes as usual second name and the third name but I can add a sub node now when I select any item or any node from here for example I'm selecting this first name which is Mark and now when I add a node Mark is um boy for example so you can see it has created a child to your node okay now I want to add a child to this sub node also then I will say 15 your okay so when you select some node it's adding a child to the that node once again right so now you know how to select and how to add a sub child to your tree view now for example you want to add some image to your treeview so I will show you how to add images to your review nodes what you need to do is just select on not select but go to your toolbx and we will use image container or image box or image list from our toolbox search for the image list okay this is the image list drag and drop into your form and you will notice this image list goes down below here what we will do is we will just click this small triangle button from here and we will say choose images okay and in here we can choose images so what we need to do just click this add button and whatever image you want to choose in the list of image so when we drag and drop image list we can choose a list of image and contain this list of image in this image list right for example I choose one two three and four Images right now and I click open and you see all the four Images are there in my image list and if you see it carefully we have the number assigned for these images these are called index of the image list right first image has index zero second has one third has two and fourth has three okay now just click okay and you can set the image size from here also so you see here image size right now is 16 by 16 which is a smaller version of images let's make them bigger for example 32x 32 so we will be able to see the images better or let's make it 64 to make it make the images more bigger 64x 64 okay so now you have set that you can also set the depth of the images which I'm leaving as default and now we have the images in the image list now what we need to do is select your tree View and and go to the image collection property okay we have this image list here when you when we select this tree view right so we have image list we select the image list one which is this image list in which we have the images right and so now we have the image list in our treeview let's see once again okay we have the image list right and we have the index for the images which we know now once again I will click this add node button and in here what I just need to do is I need to add extra extra argument to the node so just when you have where you have preview one. node. add and after these two this key and this um text we will make one more argument as image index as you remember image index 0 1 2 3 right so I will give the image index zero and comma selected image index so fourth argument is the selected image index which is one so this will show the image number zero and this will show the image number one right okay here also in the selected image I will add 0 comma 1 okay now when I run the program once again and I want to add a node once again you have this image and you have this name Mark once again some other name you have second name but when you select any any of the node the image changes so this is index number zero which is not selected and this is index number one for the image which is selected right let's add one more node and the same phenomena will occur for this also right so whenever you choose some image it changes according to the selection okay now for example you want to use all the images which is there in the image list one by one so what I will do is once again I will go to the this button double click it we have this code already I will declare outside this method for button click just below this class form one I'll declare dim I as integer is equal to Zer okay so I have declared a variable I which is integer and we will Loop this integer in a loop okay so I will write here I is equal to in the brackets I + 1 which will Loop my images and I will say mod four because I have four Images so it will Loop every four Images right and this I I will replace it with these index zero and one so I will say I here I here I will go here and I I will also go here okay so what I have done I have declared this integer and I'm looping this integer one by one in the loop of four and I just replace this index of the image by this integer once again I will run my program add some node and once again add some node and and once again add some node and once again add some node okay so you see whatever images I have selected these all four Images are different but when I now add one more images it will start looping the earlier image so this first image and this last image is same because we only have four four images and it's start looping once again right so now we when we add it will add the second image this image and this image will be same right this image okay or when we add a next image because we have selected this node it will add the next image here so in this way you can Loop your images also so I think you have uh now understood how to use uh Tree View basically with your Visual Basic Windows Form application I hope you have learned something new this time please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
