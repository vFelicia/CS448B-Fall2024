00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use images in your Android
00:10 - activity and also we are going to make a
00:14 - cool app uh to change im images on
00:18 - button click so let's get started first
00:22 - of all we are going to add some images
00:25 - to our app so go to your uh project and
00:30 - search for the folder called app and
00:32 - inside this folder you will be able to
00:34 - see this folder called Rees or resources
00:37 - folder and inside this resources folder
00:40 - there will be a folder called
00:42 - drawable so all your images you are want
00:46 - to uh you know keep inside this drawable
00:49 - folder so this is the folder for keeping
00:52 - all your uh image resources so go to
00:56 - this drawable folder right click on this
00:59 - drawable folder ER and go to new and
01:03 - click the option called image asset okay
01:06 - so click the option called image asset
01:10 - and in here you can add four type of uh
01:16 - image or whatever image you uh choose it
01:21 - will be converted into four types one is
01:25 - hdpi which is high DPI second is medium
01:29 - M DPI or
01:31 - mdpi third is X DPI or H
01:36 - xhdpi which is extra high DPI and uh XX
01:42 - D xxh DPI so high quality DPI this is
01:46 - also
01:48 - so I'm just going to click okay just
01:52 - choose one of them uh it doesn't matter
01:55 - which one you choose because whatever
01:58 - image you will choose it will be
02:00 - converted into all these formats right
02:04 - so just click okay and in here you will
02:08 - see uh there is a PNG a default PNG file
02:13 - already provided by our project and in
02:16 - here now we want to add our new files so
02:20 - I have uh two uh Android icons here in
02:23 - my folder you can find the Android icons
02:26 - easily on internet or on some site so uh
02:31 - download these uh icons from here these
02:35 - are PNG images in my case but uh they
02:38 - can be different now what I'm going to
02:42 - do is I'm going to give my resource name
02:45 - first so for
02:46 - example uh a and
02:50 - Dore image
02:53 - 1 so uh this is the resource name you
02:57 - need to give uh for your image okay and
03:02 - uh asset type is launcher icon and in
03:05 - here uh in the image file you just need
03:10 - to give the path of your image okay so
03:14 - for example my image path for this is I
03:19 - will just copy the path here and paste
03:22 - it here and then I can see my folder and
03:26 - in here I can choose my PNG file one is
03:30 - PNG file and other is JPG file so I'm
03:34 - going to take both of the files and show
03:36 - you um that both of them works so first
03:40 - of all I will choose this Android one
03:43 - JPG file from here and then this file
03:47 - will be converted into these four
03:50 - formats right and then I will click
03:55 - next and all these options are okay and
03:59 - I will click finish and once you click
04:01 - finish you will be able to see there are
04:03 - four type of images generated which is
04:05 - hdpi mdpi xhdpi and xx hdpi four types
04:11 - of images inside your drawable folder
04:16 - these four types of images are generated
04:19 - because uh you know your app will be
04:22 - able to uh resize these images on the
04:25 - basis of the phone size right that's
04:29 - that's why it has generated these four
04:31 - IM type of
04:33 - images I am going to add one more
04:36 - resource in the same
04:45 - way click next and finish so now I have
04:48 - added two images inside my drawable
04:51 - folder right now in order to add these
04:55 - images to your Android activity there is
04:58 - a widget called image view so you can
05:00 - drag and drop this widget here and in
05:05 - here you can uh resize this uh widget
05:09 - also but first of all what we are going
05:12 - to do is we are going to uh add some
05:16 - resource to this widget so just double
05:19 - click this widget and then in the source
05:24 - you just uh need to choose your source
05:27 - so just click this small button
05:30 - uh at the side of this source and in
05:33 - here you will be able to see at the
05:35 - bottom your two images and D image 1 and
05:41 - a and d image 2 okay so I'm going to
05:44 - choose the first image and click okay
05:48 - and now you will be able to see the your
05:50 - image here what I'm going to do is I'm
05:53 - going to add a button here okay
06:00 - and I'm going to uh change this button
06:03 - uh name as switch
06:06 - image so I'm going to use this for
06:09 - switching
06:10 - image
06:13 - switch image
06:17 - okay now you can notice that the size of
06:20 - this image is not uh you know uh fitting
06:24 - to your Android activity so you can drag
06:28 - the the side of of your image and resize
06:32 - it like this okay and it will be resized
06:36 - but by resizing this image view uh you
06:40 - will also notice that this uh size of
06:43 - this image stays the same which is small
06:47 - size right now in order to stretch your
06:50 - image according to the size of this
06:52 - image view what you can do is there is a
06:55 - property here in your property so select
06:58 - your image view here here and search for
07:01 - the
07:02 - property called scale type and in the
07:06 - properties there will be a property
07:09 - called scale type in here and by default
07:14 - this will be sent uh you know scale type
07:18 - so when you click this uh section here
07:22 - in front of the scale type property you
07:25 - will be able to change your uh you know
07:29 - scale type type so I'm going to choose
07:32 - fit Center and it's going to get little
07:36 - bit bigger according to the center right
07:39 - and you can choose uh other properties
07:43 - of scale type to fit your
07:51 - requirement for us uh fit Center is okay
07:55 - for now okay so now uh what I'm going to
07:59 - do is I'm going to add a click event to
08:03 - this button and we are going to uh
08:07 - choose the second image using uh this
08:11 - button so we are going to uh make an app
08:14 - whenever users click this button is
08:18 - going to change this images again and
08:20 - again and again okay so what I'm going
08:22 - to do is I'm going to go to my
08:26 - uh main activity. Java file so just
08:29 - click this file and in here first of all
08:33 - we are going to uh declare our two uh
08:38 - image View and button variables
08:52 - right so now we have uh declared our two
08:56 - variables and now we are going to create
08:59 - a method which we are going to call in
09:01 - our on create method so let's create a
09:05 - method
09:07 - public
09:14 - wide button click method for example and
09:18 - inside
09:19 - this first of all we are going to cast
09:22 - these two variables one is for image and
09:25 - we will assign the ID of the widget to
09:44 - them so now we have casted our variables
09:48 - and now we are going to take this button
09:50 - submit and we are going to set our on
09:53 - click method to it so button sub submit
09:56 - do set on click listener and inside this
09:59 - on click listener we are going to call a
10:02 - new on click
10:05 - listener now inside this onclick method
10:09 - what we are going to do is first of all
10:11 - let's declare two more variables at the
10:15 - top and these variables will be one for
10:20 - current image index so this will
10:26 - be private int
10:32 - current
10:35 - image index and second we are going to
10:39 - declare an INT array for the images
10:46 - so
10:47 - images is equal to and we are going to
10:50 - initialize this array by the images
10:55 - themselves so we are going to find the
10:57 - ID of these imag
11:00 - these images are in the drawable folder
11:03 - you can see here so we can just find the
11:06 - them by r dot
11:10 - drawable dot now the name of this so my
11:15 - first image name
11:17 - is and image 1 in the same way you can
11:23 - uh find second image so so I'm going to
11:26 - add this third image called icore
11:29 - launcher which was already present so R
11:33 - do
11:38 - drawable do
11:40 - iore launcher okay so now we have array
11:46 - of three
11:47 - images in this image variable right so
11:51 - now in our on click method what we are
11:54 - going to do is first of all we are going
11:57 - to increase the index of this current
12:00 - image so current image
12:03 - Plus+ and then uh this current image uh
12:08 - will be we are going to assign it to the
12:11 - current image
12:14 - modulus the length of your length of
12:19 - your uh image array so we are going to
12:23 - take this
12:25 - images variable dot length
12:30 - okay so now what we are going to do is
12:33 - on the basis of this index we can uh you
12:37 - know call this index which will indicate
12:41 - this uh these uh images one by one right
12:45 - so what I'm going to do is in this image
12:47 - view
12:48 - variable I'm going to set the image so
12:52 - image view dot
12:55 - set and I'm going to set the image and
12:59 - this will be the image resource so set
13:03 - image resource and then we are going to
13:07 - take this array of image and then we are
13:11 - going to call these images on the basis
13:14 - of index and index uh is this one
13:20 - right so now uh our code is ready one uh
13:25 - more thing we need to do is we need to
13:27 - call this button click event inside our
13:32 - oncreate method right now uh we are
13:36 - ready so we are going to run
13:38 - our app so now our app is running and
13:42 - you can see this image on our activity
13:46 - and let's uh click this button and let's
13:49 - see what happens while clicking this
13:52 - button so I'm going to click this button
13:55 - and the image changes once again I'm
13:57 - going to click this button and the image
14:00 - changes so every time you click this
14:04 - button this index changes in the image
14:09 - array and we can see new
14:12 - array or if you want to just set one
14:16 - image what you can do is instead of uh
14:20 - writing this code and in here you can
14:22 - directly call your r. drawable do
14:26 - whatever image name you have inside here
14:29 - okay and this will just call your one
14:32 - image and it will not switch our images
14:35 - one by one by one okay so this is direct
14:39 - calling of image using this uh set image
14:44 - resources so I hope you have enjoyed
14:46 - this video please RIT comment and

for example my image path for this is I will just copy the path here and paste it here and then I can see my folder and in here I can choose my PNG file one is PNG file and other is JPG file so I'm going to take both of the files and show you um that both of them works so first of all I will choose this Android one JPG file from here and then this file will be converted into these four formats right and then I will click next and all these options are okay and I will click finish and once you click finish you will be able to see there are four type of images generated which is hdpi mdpi xhdpi and xx hdpi four types of images inside your drawable folder these four types of images are generated because uh you know your app will be able to uh resize these images on the basis of the phone size right that's that's why it has generated these four IM type of images I am going to add one more resource in the same way click next and finish so now I have added two images inside my drawable folder right now in order to add these images to your Android activity there is a widget called image view so you can drag and drop this widget here and in here you can uh resize this uh widget also but first of all what we are going to do is we are going to uh add some resource to this widget so just double click this widget and then in the source you just uh need to choose your

of of your image and resize it like this okay and it will be resized but by resizing this image view uh you will also notice that this uh size of this image stays the same which is small size right now in order to stretch your image according to the size of this image view what you can do is there is a property here in your property so select your image view here here and search for the property called scale type and in the properties there will be a property called scale type in here and by default this will be sent uh you know scale type so when you click this uh section here in front of the scale type property you will be able to change your uh you know scale type type so I'm going to choose fit Center and it's going to get little bit bigger according to the center right and you can choose uh other properties of scale type to fit your requirement for us uh fit Center is okay for now okay so now uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a click event to this button and we are going to uh choose the second image using uh this button so we are going to uh make an app whenever users click this button is going to change this images again and again and again okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my uh main activity. Java file so just click this file and in here first of all we are going to uh declare our two uh image View and button variables right so now we have uh declared our two variables and now we are going to create a method which we are going to call in our on create method so let's create a method public wide button click method for example and inside this first of all we are going to cast these two variables one is for image and we will assign the ID of the widget to them so now we have casted our variables and now we are going to take this button submit and we are going to set our on click method to it so button sub submit do set on click listener and inside this on click listener we are going to call a new on click listener now inside this onclick method what we are going to do is first of all let's declare two more variables at the top and these variables will be one for current image index so this will be private int current image index and second we are going to declare an INT array for the images so images is equal to and we are going to initialize this array by the images themselves so we are going to find the ID of these imag these images are in the drawable folder you can see here so we can just find the them by r dot drawable dot now the name of this so my first image name is and image 1 in the same way you can uh find second image so so I'm going to add this third image called icore launcher which was already present so R do drawable do iore launcher okay so now we have array of three images in this image variable right so now in our on click method what we are going to do is first of all we are going to increase the index of this current image so current image Plus+ and then uh this current image uh will be we are going to assign it to the current image modulus the length of your length of your uh image array so we are going to take this images variable dot length okay so now what we are going to do is on the basis of this index we can uh you know call this index which will indicate this uh these uh images one by one right so what I'm going to do is in this image view variable I'm going to set the image so image view dot set and I'm going to set the image and this will be the image resource so set image resource and then we are going to take this array of image and then we are going to call these images on the basis of index and index uh is this one right so now uh our code is ready one uh more thing we need to do is we need to call this button click event inside our oncreate method right now uh we are ready so we are going to run our app so now our app is running and you can see this image on our activity and let's uh click this button and let's see what happens while clicking this button so I'm going to click this button and the image changes once again I'm going to click this button and the image changes so every time you click this button this index changes in the image array and we can see new array or if you want to just set one image what you can do is instead of uh writing this code and in here you can directly call your r. drawable do whatever image name you have inside here okay and this will just call your one image and it will not switch our images one by one by one okay so this is direct calling of image using this uh set image resources so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
