00:00 - program knowledge in our previous video
00:02 - we saw how to create and proper data
00:05 - rate in this video I am gonna show you
00:07 - how to create a table so first of all
00:10 - you need to open a terminal or command
00:12 - wrong just write PS q now let us see
00:23 - each other databases present own system
00:26 - right backslash come here you can see we
00:31 - have four test database and we are going
00:34 - to use that one so for connect to the
00:38 - test database by let's see within
00:42 - today today Simon :
00:45 - now we are connected to the database
00:47 - test now we need to create a table which
00:51 - present in this place to double so the
00:56 - command is create table the name of the
01:03 - table let's say employee that gets small
01:13 - records in small brackets we provide the
01:18 - name of the column and the respective
01:21 - datatypes
01:22 - now there are various data types
01:24 - available in 4 straight SQL that you can
01:28 - use like if you want to use numbers then
01:32 - you can use integer begins small int
01:35 - float real if you want to store
01:39 - character then you can use care where
01:41 - care and you can also use text for long
01:45 - tests so if you want to know about if
01:48 - you want to know more about datatypes
01:50 - plan you can go to the documentation or
01:54 - post area so let us say first column is
01:59 - name
02:02 - I found it at a fair care of length 10
02:09 - times the length of the name column then
02:16 - I use ID and 19 okay
02:24 - now the most important thing in the
02:27 - table is primary key i define ID is my
02:34 - primary key for the employee table now
02:37 - what is the primary key well we will
02:41 - discuss more about primary key number
02:43 - later videos but for now for the sake of
02:46 - convenience you just need to know that
02:48 - every table must have a primary key a
02:52 - column defined as a primary key so that
02:55 - that column can uniquely identify a
02:59 - table so ID are unique for all the
03:04 - employees so I choose ID as my primary
03:08 - key so by column and primary key then I
03:21 - name watch the column that you want to
03:24 - satisfy many records ok whatever is
03:31 - created so how we can see this this
03:36 - table so by excellent building here you
03:42 - can see employee table is created here
03:47 - you can also see this is called schema
03:50 - which is public we will discuss more
03:53 - about schema in our later videos so stay
03:56 - tuned for that
03:57 - now if we want to know the structure of
04:02 - our table then simply write business
04:07 - name of the table
04:13 - you know you can say our employ SS to
04:16 - Paula M Noddy and this is respective
04:20 - data types
04:22 - it is the rank that so across this now
04:30 - we can start with which she had me okay
04:37 - now in test in schema in public schema
04:52 - this is the devil so let us create one
04:58 - more table in these test data we need to
05:09 - name and execute just refresh here and
06:15 - you can see in tables we have product
06:29 - okay you can expand now if you want to
06:38 - release this table then right drop table
06:44 - in name of the table refresh it and you
06:54 - can see strong table has been deleted so
06:58 - this is how you can create a table and
07:02 - drop it so thanks for watching
