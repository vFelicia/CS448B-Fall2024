00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can install and set up
00:04 - node.js on your Mac so let's get started
00:08 - first of all I'm going to open my Safari
00:10 - browser and then I will open for example
00:14 - google.com and then search for no cheer
00:18 - so search for
00:20 - nogf and the first link most properly
00:24 - which will appear here will be from nogf
00:27 - dodgy so just click the website which
00:31 - says no GF dot o-r-g and here you will
00:35 - be able to see two versions one is LTF
00:39 - LDS stands for long term version and
00:42 - other is the latest version so one we
00:46 - want to download right now is the LTS
00:50 - version which because it's supported for
00:52 - the long term right so long term stable
00:56 - version right so I'm going to just
00:58 - download the LTS version in this in your
01:01 - case it can be different right so let me
01:05 - download it so now my download is
01:08 - complete so I'm going to go to my folder
01:11 - downloads folder and there I can see
01:15 - this nodejs version fixed point and
01:19 - point 0 package so I'm going to double
01:21 - click on it and this is going to start
01:25 - this kind of wizard so it's really easy
01:29 - to follow this wizard once this wizard
01:32 - is open you just need to click continue
01:34 - here and then read the license terms and
01:37 - conditions and if you agree with those
01:40 - license terms and conditions then just
01:43 - click continue so let me click continue
01:47 - once again and then it fails to continue
01:50 - installing the software you must agree
01:53 - to the license so just say agree and in
01:57 - the next step
01:58 - just select install for all users of
02:00 - this computer and then click continue
02:02 - and then once again click install which
02:07 - is going to start installing your
02:09 - node.js on your Mac in between you just
02:13 - need to give
02:13 - your password for your computer here to
02:16 - authenticate for the installation and
02:18 - once this is done the installation
02:21 - process will start and will be soon
02:24 - completed so the installation process of
02:27 - nogf is completed now and you can see
02:31 - the location where no GFF install so the
02:34 - location where no Jeff is installed is
02:37 - user local bin node for no Jeff and this
02:42 - comes with NPM also which stands for
02:45 - node package manager which is really
02:47 - important with nogf whenever you develop
02:51 - your node applications you need to have
02:55 - this NPM package manager right these are
02:58 - the location if you want to note them
03:00 - just note them otherwise just close this
03:03 - window here and then open your terminal
03:07 - right so how you can open the terminal
03:10 - if you see the terminal here you can you
03:13 - know open the terminal from this bar
03:16 - from here otherwise if you don't find
03:19 - this terminal here then go to the finder
03:21 - so just open the finder and in the
03:24 - finder go to applications and in the
03:28 - application just search for terminal so
03:31 - I'm going to just search for terminal
03:34 - and I can see this terminal here so just
03:38 - double-click on in this terminal is
03:40 - going to open the terminal
03:42 - right so once the terminal is open we
03:45 - are going to check whether know Jeff is
03:47 - installed and which version of node.js
03:49 - is is installed so just type node - V
03:54 - here and then press ENTER it's going to
03:57 - show the version of node which is
03:58 - installed and in our case we have
04:01 - installed devotion 6 point 10.0 it can
04:05 - be different in your case and now we
04:07 - will see the version of node package
04:09 - manager which is NPM so just type NPM -
04:12 - V and it's also going to give you the
04:16 - version of NPM which is 3 point 10.10 in
04:18 - my case once both versions are verified
04:23 - you just see these numbers here then you
04:26 - just need to type know
04:27 - here and then press Enter and you you
04:31 - know you are in the node terminal so for
04:34 - example I want to print something so I
04:36 - can just write console dot log and then
04:41 - in the parentheses and single quotes I
04:45 - can just say hello world and then the
04:51 - semicolon and then press ENTER and you
04:53 - can see hello world is printed here and
04:55 - after that undefined right so this shows
05:00 - that no Jeff is installed on your system
05:03 - and it's working fine right so in this
05:06 - way you can download and install nodejs
05:10 - on your Mac I hope you enjoyed this
