00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last couple of videos I have been
00:04 - teaching you about arrays now in this
00:07 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:10 - declare and use multi-dimensional array
00:13 - in
00:14 - C++ so let's see how we can declare
00:19 - multi-dimensional array for example
00:21 - array of 2 cross 2 or 2 cross 3 how we
00:25 - can declare this now for
00:28 - declaration it's the same as array so I
00:32 - will just name my array as
00:36 - my array and then you give the square
00:40 - bracket and then you give the
00:43 - element number of element
00:46 - your array will contain this till this
00:50 - you know now in order to declare a multi
00:53 - dimensional array you can or two
00:57 - dimensional array you will give one more
01:00 - square bracket and give the value
01:04 - of columns so I will I will explain you
01:08 - once i' I'm done finished
01:12 - writing so I will give
01:17 - this and
01:19 - this and
01:22 - one
01:25 - more this and
01:28 - comma okay
01:35 - and give the
01:41 - values okay so now I I'm finished now
01:46 - what this array
01:49 - means this means this is a
01:52 - array which is a two-dimensional array
01:56 - and which contains two rows and three
01:59 - columns
02:00 - right so you can think it like
02:05 - this so this is an array of 1 2
02:11 - 3
02:14 - and
02:16 - 4 four and five so this array in
02:22 - logically will look like this it's a
02:24 - two-dimensional array which has one and
02:28 - two rows and
02:32 - one two and three columns right so in
02:37 - your mind you can map this array like
02:39 - this now in order to access the value
02:43 - for example I want to print out this
02:46 - value I want the index of this value
02:50 - right so how you can find the index of
02:53 - this value is just like coordinates if
02:56 - you have studies coordinates in school
03:00 - you know that this is my zero row and I
03:04 - want the column or item two of this zero
03:08 - row or item one this is item one because
03:11 - our array starts from zero
03:13 - right so for example I will write C
03:18 - out and I want to print this two here so
03:23 - I will say my
03:26 - array
03:28 - and
03:32 - this will be like
03:35 - this and once
03:41 - more okay so now I want to print this
03:46 - value so first of all I will see which
03:49 - in which row this value is so this is
03:53 - the row number zero so I will write zero
03:57 - here and this is my my column number one
04:01 - or index of the column is one logically
04:04 - it's 1 2 3 but index start from zero 0 1
04:10 - 2 right that's why I will write here one
04:15 - so this logically should r or print two
04:20 - let's try and see whether it prints two
04:24 - or not yes it prints now for example we
04:27 - want to print five so this five is in
04:32 - our zero row and one so index of this
04:37 - row is 1 and the column index is 0 1 2
04:43 - so we will write
04:45 - here one row number one or index of the
04:49 - row is one and the index of the column
04:53 - is
04:54 - two save run and you can see five is
04:58 - printed
05:00 - now there is more convenient way of
05:03 - printing this two-dimensional array for
05:06 - example you have a bigger array four
05:09 - cross five array
05:11 - or 10 cross 10 array you cannot PR
05:15 - logically you know you you if you want
05:18 - to print it like this how you can print
05:20 - it let's
05:22 - see so you need to declare a for
05:27 - Loop and
05:31 - the curly braces and once again a for
05:34 - Loop so you need to have a nested for
05:38 - Loop or you need to use nested for Loop
05:41 - and in this for first for Loop what I'm
05:44 - going to do is I will declare I or let's
05:48 - see I will declare it logically so I
05:51 - will say this will contain this for Loop
05:54 - will loop around the rows and row index
05:58 - will start from zero
06:00 - and it will go up
06:02 - to
06:05 - row less
06:09 - than two because uh we have only two
06:13 - rows
06:15 - and row
06:18 - Plus+ in the same way I will declare or
06:21 - I will initialize for Loop for column
06:27 - in column is equal to 0 and then this
06:32 - column will go up
06:37 - to column is less than three because we
06:40 - have three
06:42 - columns
06:46 - and column plus
06:49 - Plus+ now in order to print this value
06:54 - what I'm going to do is I will C out I
06:57 - will write C out and then then I will
07:01 - take this uh array my array and then I
07:07 - will right
07:14 - here you take this row element here and
07:18 - paste it here and the column element
07:20 - here and paste it here and one more
07:23 - thing if you want to print just like
07:26 - this you need to give the space right
07:30 - give space
07:32 - here and in order to change the row you
07:37 - need
07:38 - to write or change the row in the outer
07:42 - for Loop so you just say see
07:48 - out and line okay now what this for
07:52 - nested for Loop will do is it will R it
07:56 - will loop around
07:57 - rows and then it will loop around
08:01 - columns and it will print all the row
08:05 - element and column element so for
08:08 - example row we go to row number zero and
08:13 - we go to column number zero first so
08:16 - here the values will be show me the
08:18 - value of 0 cross 0 so row number0 and
08:23 - col column number 0o and the element 0
08:28 - cross 0 in
08:30 - this array is this one so it will print
08:33 - this then 0 1 is 02 like this so let's
08:39 - try and run the program and you can see
08:43 - it has printed just like this one 2 3
08:46 - and 4 4 five so by using nest for nested
08:50 - for Loop you can print the values in the
08:53 - multi-dimensional aray I hope you have
08:56 - enjoyed this video please wait comment
08:57 - and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in the last couple of videos I have been teaching you about arrays now in this video I'm going to show you how you can declare and use multidimensional array in C++ so let's see how we can declare multidimensional array for example array of 2 cross 2 or 2 cross 3 how we can declare this now for declaration it's the same as array so I will just name my array as my array and then you give the square bracket and then you give the element number of element your array will contain this till this you know now in order to declare a multi dimensional array you can or two dimensional array you will give one more square bracket and give the value of columns so I will I will explain you once i' I'm done finished writing so I will give this and this and one more this and comma okay and give the values okay so now I I'm finished now what this array means this means this is a array which is a twodimensional array and which contains two rows and three columns right so you can think it like this so this is an array of 1 2 3 and 4 four and five so this array in logically will look like this it's a twodimensional array which has one and two rows and one two and three columns right so in your mind you can map this array like this now in order to access the value for example I want to print out this value I want the index of this value right so how you can find the index of this value is just like coordinates if you have studies coordinates in school you know that this is my zero row and I want the column or item two of this zero row or item one this is item one because our array starts from zero right so for example I will write C out and I want to print this two here so I will say my array and this will be like this and once more okay so now I want to print this value so first of all I will see which in which row this value is so this is the row number zero so I will write zero here and this is my my column number one or index of the column is one logically it's 1 2 3 but index start from zero 0 1 2 right that's why I will write here one so this logically should r or print two let's try and see whether it prints two or not yes it prints now for example we want to print five so this five is in our zero row and one so index of this row is 1 and the column index is 0 1 2 so we will write here one row number one or index of the row is one and the index of the column is two save run and you can see five is printed now there is more convenient way of printing this twodimensional array for example you have a bigger array four cross five array or 10 cross 10 array you cannot PR logically you know you you if you want to print it like this how you can print it let's see so you need to declare a for Loop and the curly braces and once again a for Loop so you need to have a nested for Loop or you need to use nested for Loop and in this for first for Loop what I'm going to do is I will declare I or let's see I will declare it logically so I will say this will contain this for Loop will loop around the rows and row index will start from zero and it will go up to row less than two because uh we have only two rows and row Plus+ in the same way I will declare or I will initialize for Loop for column in column is equal to 0 and then this column will go up to column is less than three because we have three columns and column plus Plus+ now in order to print this value what I'm going to do is I will C out I will write C out and then then I will take this uh array my array and then I will right here you take this row element here and paste it here and the column element here and paste it here and one more thing if you want to print just like this you need to give the space right give space here and in order to change the row you need to write or change the row in the outer for Loop so you just say see out and line okay now what this for nested for Loop will do is it will R it will loop around rows and then it will loop around columns and it will print all the row element and column element so for example row we go to row number zero and we go to column number zero first so here the values will be show me the value of 0 cross 0 so row number0 and col column number 0o and the element 0 cross 0 in this array is this one so it will print this then 0 1 is 02 like this so let's try and run the program and you can see it has printed just like this one 2 3 and 4 4 five so by using nest for nested for Loop you can print the values in the multidimensional aray I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
