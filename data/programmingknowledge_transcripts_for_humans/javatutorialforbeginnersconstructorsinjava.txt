00:01 - hello and welcome back to another video
00:03 - without real series so today we will be
00:04 - covering Constructors in Java so
00:07 - whatever Constructor in Con in Java a
00:09 - Constructor is a block of course uh
00:11 - similar to the method it is called when
00:14 - the instance of the class is created uh
00:17 - that means whenever the whenever create
00:18 - an object The Constructor will get
00:20 - automatically called okay at the time of
00:23 - the calling of the Constructor memory
00:24 - for the object is allocated inside the
00:26 - memory
00:27 - okay whenever we create an object the
00:31 - memory is get allocated to that class
00:33 - inside the memory okay and the rules for
00:36 - the configurating a Constructor in Java
00:39 - there are there are two rules defined
00:41 - for the Constructor Constructor name
00:43 - must be same as as that of the class
00:46 - name uh let's suppose you have created
00:50 - one class name
00:52 - ABC
00:54 - okay
00:55 - ABC
00:58 - and inside that class if you want to
01:01 - declare the Constructor for that class
01:04 - then the Constructor should be a b c and
01:07 - the other constructory accepted in the
01:09 - parameter it depends upon you and inside
01:12 - this you will write code for that
01:15 - Constructor okay
01:18 - construct
01:22 - goes here
01:27 - you will see in our coding part also uh
01:30 - in detail
01:31 - and second second rule is a Java
01:34 - Constructor cannot be abstract static
01:36 - final or synchronized you cannot cannot
01:40 - use these keywords before declaring The
01:42 - Constructor like abstract a here you can
01:45 - see abstract ABC final ABC static ABC
01:48 - this is not allowed in Java you have to
01:51 - if you want to create a Constructor for
01:53 - that class simply write the class name
01:55 - and inside the circular circular basis
01:57 - you will write the parameter that
01:59 - Constructor is accepting
02:02 - okay so there are basically two types of
02:04 - Constructor in Java one is default
02:06 - Constructor and one is uh parameterized
02:09 - Constructor so let's first see what is
02:12 - default Constructor and let me get into
02:14 - my IDE and I will create one new Java
02:17 - class
02:18 - name Constructor
02:22 - let me increase the font size I will
02:25 - write main method here okay uh I will
02:28 - declare one another class
02:32 - class ABC I will get that example itself
02:36 - and inside this if I want to create one
02:40 - default Constructor one default
02:43 - Constructor is nothing but
02:45 - a Constructor that is called default
02:46 - when it doesn't have any parameter okay
02:49 - so if I write this like this
02:53 - and if I inside this if I write out
02:58 - hello
03:00 - World okay so here you can see over we
03:04 - have declared one Constructor for that
03:05 - ABC class and inside the circular basis
03:09 - we have not passing any parameter to it
03:11 - okay so this is this is an example for
03:13 - the default Constructor to invoke this
03:16 - Constructor we will simply go in our
03:18 - main method and create an object for
03:20 - this class okay one thing I am missing
03:23 - naming convention in Java class name
03:25 - should always start from the capital
03:27 - letter
03:29 - ABC okay now it's correct uh if I want
03:33 - to create an object
03:34 - as we have discussed in our previous
03:36 - video uh if you want to create an object
03:39 - simply write the class name and write
03:42 - the object name that you want new ABC
03:47 - and inside here I'm not passing any
03:50 - parameter because the Constructor of
03:51 - that class doesn't uh accepting any
03:54 - parameter okay uh in new line I will
03:56 - just
03:57 - now I will not do anything I will just
04:00 - create that object and simply run this
04:03 - program
04:04 - now here you can see
04:07 - in console hello world is getting
04:09 - printed okay why this is so because we
04:12 - are able to create an object of the
04:17 - okay so now we will look into the
04:19 - parameterized Constructor so Constructor
04:22 - which has a specific number of the
04:23 - parameters is known as The parameterized
04:25 - Constructor
04:26 - and we will see one example of the
04:29 - parameterized Constructor over here and
04:33 - okay
04:35 - and let me give you an example
04:39 - if I write like this okay so if I write
04:42 - integer a
04:44 - command T sorry
04:48 - integer B
04:50 - okay now here you can see a intelligent
04:54 - idea is throwing error because it was it
04:57 - was telling me expected two arguments
04:59 - but found zero now this is this is this
05:01 - is the example of the parameterized
05:02 - Constructor where the Constructor of a
05:04 - class is accept accepting one
05:06 - better some parameters and we need to
05:09 - pass that parameter in inside there uh
05:12 - Constructor when we whenever we create
05:13 - an object of that class okay
05:15 - now I will pass here something 15 sorry
05:20 - 15
05:23 - comma 20. okay uh it uh this Constructor
05:27 - is accepting two integer values and I
05:29 - have passed 5922 The Constructor okay
05:32 - and inside this Constructor we will be
05:34 - doing some operation using that uh two
05:37 - integers let me just print
05:41 - a plus b
05:45 - and print
05:47 - a minus B
05:53 - print
05:54 - a into B
05:58 - print
05:59 - a divided by B these are some basic
06:01 - operation math mathematical operation
06:03 - that I have performed here uh the
06:05 - purpose of telling this is uh whenever
06:07 - you create an object or the the
06:08 - parameterized Constructor though we have
06:10 - to pass that parameters to that
06:12 - Constructor there itself and the
06:15 - Constructor will get those parameters
06:18 - values and process the information
06:20 - according to this
06:22 - okay and now if I run this
06:25 - it will print me
06:27 - okay so here you can see 20 plus 15 is
06:30 - 35 uh a minus B that is 15 minus uh 20
06:33 - is minus five or a into B is the 20 into
06:37 - 15 C uh 300 and uh a divided by a
06:40 - divided by B uh 15 divided by 20 is uh
06:43 - it is giving me zero because I have uh
06:46 - both the variables are in integer and
06:48 - and such is always coming if the both
06:50 - operators are integer answer is also
06:52 - coming in integer itself okay so this is
06:55 - pretty much about the default and
06:57 - parameterized Constructor uh let me
07:00 - check if I'm missing something okay uh
07:03 - we have to see one difference of between
07:05 - the Constructor and methods because
07:08 - here you can see the Constructor is not
07:11 - different pretty much different from the
07:13 - method because we in method also we
07:16 - would write the return type and if I
07:18 - write a b c
07:21 - and this is the con this is our method
07:24 - there is no difference between this
07:27 - method and Constructor so let's see the
07:30 - difference
07:31 - a constructory is used to initialize the
07:33 - state of an object and whether the
07:35 - whereas the method is used to expose the
07:37 - behavior of an object okay and the
07:40 - method must have a return type the
07:41 - Constructor must not have a written time
07:43 - here you can see we didn't write any
07:45 - written statement for the Constructor
07:47 - and for that method we have to write the
07:50 - return statement unless and until the
07:52 - method method written type is void okay
07:55 - and the Constructor is invoked
07:57 - implicitly implicitly because whenever
07:59 - we create an object we we don't writing
08:01 - any uh like this obj dot ABC we are not
08:07 - writing like this this is this is we are
08:10 - writing only for the methods okay and
08:13 - methods are called using this
08:16 - object name okay the methods invoke
08:19 - explicitly in Java compiler provides a
08:21 - default Constructor if you don't have
08:23 - any Constructor in the class uh and and
08:26 - the method is not provided by the
08:27 - compiler in any case the Constructor
08:29 - must have the same name as that of the
08:31 - class name here you can see ABC is there
08:34 - and Constructor name is also ABC and the
08:37 - method name may vary a way may or may
08:40 - not be same as the class name you can
08:42 - write it as same as the class name or
08:46 - you can give any name whatever you want
08:48 - okay
08:49 - so this is pretty much about the
08:50 - difference between the construction
08:53 - method and in our coming video we will
08:55 - be discussing about
08:57 - static and disk keyword in Java thank
09:00 - you for watching this video

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to another video without real series so today we will be covering Constructors in Java so whatever Constructor in Con in Java a Constructor is a block of course uh similar to the method it is called when the instance of the class is created uh that means whenever the whenever create an object The Constructor will get automatically called okay at the time of the calling of the Constructor memory for the object is allocated inside the memory okay whenever we create an object the memory is get allocated to that class inside the memory okay and the rules for the configurating a Constructor in Java there are there are two rules defined for the Constructor Constructor name must be same as as that of the class name uh let's suppose you have created one class name ABC okay ABC and inside that class if you want to declare the Constructor for that class then the Constructor should be a b c and the other constructory accepted in the parameter it depends upon you and inside this you will write code for that Constructor okay construct goes here you will see in our coding part also uh in detail and second second rule is a Java Constructor cannot be abstract static final or synchronized you cannot cannot use these keywords before declaring The Constructor like abstract a here you can see abstract ABC final ABC static ABC this is not allowed in Java you have to if you want to create a Constructor for that class simply write the class name and inside the circular circular basis you will write the parameter that Constructor is accepting okay so there are basically two types of Constructor in Java one is default Constructor and one is uh parameterized Constructor so let's first see what is default Constructor and let me get into my IDE and I will create one new Java class name Constructor let me increase the font size I will write main method here okay uh I will declare one another class class ABC I will get that example itself and inside this if I want to create one default Constructor one default Constructor is nothing but a Constructor that is called default when it doesn't have any parameter okay so if I write this like this and if I inside this if I write out hello World okay so here you can see over we have declared one Constructor for that ABC class and inside the circular basis we have not passing any parameter to it okay so this is this is an example for the default Constructor to invoke this Constructor we will simply go in our main method and create an object for this class okay one thing I am missing naming convention in Java class name should always start from the capital letter ABC okay now it's correct uh if I want to create an object as we have discussed in our previous video uh if you want to create an object simply write the class name and write the object name that you want new ABC and inside here I'm not passing any parameter because the Constructor of that class doesn't uh accepting any parameter okay uh in new line I will just now I will not do anything I will just create that object and simply run this program now here you can see in console hello world is getting printed okay why this is so because we are able to create an object of the okay so now we will look into the parameterized Constructor so Constructor which has a specific number of the parameters is known as The parameterized Constructor and we will see one example of the parameterized Constructor over here and okay and let me give you an example if I write like this okay so if I write integer a command T sorry integer B okay now here you can see a intelligent idea is throwing error because it was it was telling me expected two arguments but found zero now this is this is this is the example of the parameterized Constructor where the Constructor of a class is accept accepting one better some parameters and we need to pass that parameter in inside there uh Constructor when we whenever we create an object of that class okay now I will pass here something 15 sorry 15 comma 20. okay uh it uh this Constructor is accepting two integer values and I have passed 5922 The Constructor okay and inside this Constructor we will be doing some operation using that uh two integers let me just print a plus b and print a minus B print a into B print a divided by B these are some basic operation math mathematical operation that I have performed here uh the purpose of telling this is uh whenever you create an object or the the parameterized Constructor though we have to pass that parameters to that Constructor there itself and the Constructor will get those parameters values and process the information according to this okay and now if I run this it will print me okay so here you can see 20 plus 15 is 35 uh a minus B that is 15 minus uh 20 is minus five or a into B is the 20 into 15 C uh 300 and uh a divided by a divided by B uh 15 divided by 20 is uh it is giving me zero because I have uh both the variables are in integer and and such is always coming if the both operators are integer answer is also coming in integer itself okay so this is pretty much about the default and parameterized Constructor uh let me check if I'm missing something okay uh we have to see one difference of between the Constructor and methods because here you can see the Constructor is not different pretty much different from the method because we in method also we would write the return type and if I write a b c and this is the con this is our method there is no difference between this method and Constructor so let's see the difference a constructory is used to initialize the state of an object and whether the whereas the method is used to expose the behavior of an object okay and the method must have a return type the Constructor must not have a written time here you can see we didn't write any written statement for the Constructor and for that method we have to write the return statement unless and until the method method written type is void okay and the Constructor is invoked implicitly implicitly because whenever we create an object we we don't writing any uh like this obj dot ABC we are not writing like this this is this is we are writing only for the methods okay and methods are called using this object name okay the methods invoke explicitly in Java compiler provides a default Constructor if you don't have any Constructor in the class uh and and the method is not provided by the compiler in any case the Constructor must have the same name as that of the class name here you can see ABC is there and Constructor name is also ABC and the method name may vary a way may or may not be same as the class name you can write it as same as the class name or you can give any name whatever you want okay so this is pretty much about the difference between the construction method and in our coming video we will be discussing about static and disk keyword in Java
