00:03 - hello everyone welcome to new vhs
00:05 - tutorial this is tutorial number six
00:07 - and you can move to this github link
00:09 - that is github.com
00:10 - pro software development slash learn
00:13 - view to get all the content
00:14 - and stuff related to this video to
00:16 - series on this github repository
00:18 - so the title would be working with
00:20 - select and multiple select in view
00:22 - and description is we will learn how to
00:24 - bind a form
00:26 - having select and multiple select
00:28 - component using
00:29 - multiple select component using view so
00:32 - that is a component having select and
00:35 - multiple select
00:35 - component using view so we will render
00:37 - this component using ugs on our
00:40 - html file so let's get started with the
00:43 - tutorial
00:44 - so very easy we can create an index six
00:46 - dot html5
00:48 - and in this index six dot html we can
00:50 - copy the content of index five dot html
00:54 - and let's change this learn view
00:56 - tutorial number
00:58 - six and then we can remove this script
01:01 - tag
01:03 - perfectly fine and we can remove this
01:05 - body
01:06 - and we can refresh this page and you
01:08 - will see that we
01:09 - are running a view in development mode
01:12 - so perfectly fine a development mode
01:14 - gives you
01:16 - uh like it gives you all the warnings
01:19 - and the like uh notifications uh in the
01:22 - sense
01:22 - that uh like this would give you all the
01:26 - warnings and
01:26 - notifications if you are doing something
01:28 - wrong in development so this
01:30 - is perfectly fine for using in in
01:32 - development one
01:34 - so let's continue the tutorial
01:37 - so let's create a few component okay
01:40 - before creating a view company let's
01:42 - create our
01:43 - form so you can
01:46 - insert a form you can use a div but it
01:48 - works perfectly i'll show you in the end
01:50 - div id is equal to games and you
01:54 - can select a game here
01:57 - and what you can do you can do select
02:02 - and inside the select you will have an
02:06 - option
02:09 - so this is football
02:13 - football uh you can have an option easy
02:16 - to
02:17 - click it and we will keep it simple
02:22 - cricket and
02:25 - uh you can do this as or you can choose
02:28 - any game that is tennis okay
02:32 - i'm running out of battery sorry for the
02:34 - disturbance
02:36 - just a second
02:39 - yeah so what you can do you can
02:42 - create tennis
02:46 - and what you can do we can give a value
02:52 - so we can give the value here as well
02:57 - and here
03:00 - so what you can do you have to give the
03:02 - value
03:03 - and you will give this as football
03:07 - cricket and
03:10 - tennis
03:14 - okay so now what you can do you can add
03:17 - the value
03:18 - and you can render the form
03:21 - on the front let's refresh this page
03:25 - the football cricket and tennis
03:27 - perfectly fine
03:30 - so now what we can do
03:35 - we model
03:38 - okay we will v model
03:42 - is equal to my choice
03:46 - so let's perfectly find wheel constant
03:49 - we'll add a script
03:51 - yes so script is already added constant
03:54 - view component
03:56 - so let's go to new view
04:00 - a view constructor with the json object
04:04 - that has element is equal to
04:07 - hash games
04:10 - uh already have will have a methods
04:14 - and a data so the method says
04:26 - the data is this
04:29 - perfectly fine
04:33 - so we'll give this data is equal to
04:37 - my choice is equal to none
04:42 - and we can
04:45 - put this output here
04:49 - my choice
04:54 - so this is perfectly fine we can refresh
04:57 - this page
04:58 - and when you click on football we have a
05:00 - choices cricket
05:02 - and tennis okay perfectly fine
05:05 - now we can work with multiple select
05:08 - so for multiple select what can you can
05:12 - do
05:14 - uh what you can do
05:20 - you can add a multiple component
05:24 - here in the select multiple is equal to
05:27 - so this would have the multiple
05:29 - component but now
05:31 - let me refresh this page
05:35 - here you can see
05:38 - here you can see okay
05:42 - okay this now it says and expects an
05:45 - array value for its binding but got
05:47 - null okay so this should be an array
05:51 - because now we are expecting a multiple
05:53 - so see how smartly this ugs work
05:56 - football
05:56 - click it tennis uh
06:00 - so to choose multiple i'll show you what
06:03 - you can do
06:03 - when you click on a single option so
06:06 - this would give you football
06:08 - cricket tennis but choose multiple two
06:11 - okay i'll
06:12 - type this
06:18 - to select multiple
06:26 - hold ctrl key
06:31 - key on your keyboard
06:39 - so now this forms make sense to select
06:42 - multiple hold ctrl key on your keyboard
06:44 - so when i ctrl key press the ctrl key on
06:46 - your keyboard that is football
06:48 - cricket and tennis here you can see i
06:50 - have the area of value
06:51 - so this is how you render select and
06:54 - multiple select
06:55 - on using vue.js so this is a very
06:58 - good option to how explore so very good
07:01 - learning
07:02 - part of the process so this works
07:04 - perfectly
07:05 - fine okay one more thing we can learn
07:08 - also
07:09 - uh we can use
07:12 - okay so what you can do
07:18 - okay
07:24 - we can add a new uh we can also learn
07:26 - one more thing
07:29 - that is let's make option
07:32 - clear data
07:36 - clear data
07:40 - okay so now when we call this function
07:43 - clear data
07:49 - okay i'll show you one thing but if we
07:52 - have an array
07:53 - a let a
07:56 - is equal to array of values one two
07:58 - three
08:00 - okay uh let me type a i'll get this on a
08:04 - dot
08:06 - uh you will have
08:10 - a dot clear okay sorry
08:13 - let me uh in just a second
08:23 - okay when you type uh
08:28 - okay okay what you can do
08:32 - okay just a second what you can do add a
08:35 - dot length zero
08:36 - three and array is equal to this so this
08:39 - would clear
08:40 - the array so we i'm trying to create an
08:43 - event
08:44 - so this dot my
08:47 - choice
08:52 - this dot my choice
08:59 - sorry this dot my choice
09:02 - is go to null okay so i'm trying to
09:05 - invoke a clear data event on this dot
09:07 - microsoft
09:08 - null but for that i'll create a button
09:13 - button and what i'll do
09:18 - clear data
09:22 - and i'm going to call this function
09:28 - okay so like in the previous uh like i
09:31 - must have shown you
09:33 - how you can click the using this at the
09:35 - right click is equal to
09:36 - you can call the method so
09:39 - we're going to copy this and we are
09:42 - going to call
09:43 - at the rate click is equal to
09:48 - clear data
09:52 - so when this clear data is called so
09:54 - first we will do console.log
09:59 - to make sure that this event is called
10:02 - clear data
10:05 - perfectly fine so let's refresh this
10:07 - page
10:08 - so when i click clear data is called
10:10 - operating right now i'll select
10:12 - football cricket tennis and click on
10:15 - clear data
10:16 - that is empty tennis cricket football
10:20 - clear data add is empty so this is how
10:23 - we can also call the functionality a
10:24 - very good example to learn
10:26 - so thank you everyone for watching this
10:29 - tutorial i'll catch you in the next
10:30 - tutorial thank you

also learn one more thing that is let's make option clear data clear data okay so now when we call this function clear data okay i'll show you one thing but if we have an array a let a is equal to array of values one two three okay uh let me type a i'll get this on a dot uh you will have a dot clear okay sorry let me uh in just a second okay when you type uh okay okay what you can do okay just a second what you can do add a dot length zero three and array is equal to this so this would clear the array so we i'm trying to create an event so this dot my choice this dot my choice sorry this dot my choice is go to null okay so i'm trying to invoke a clear data event on this dot microsoft null but for that i'll create a button button and what i'll do clear data and i'm going to call this function okay so like in the previous uh like i must have shown you how you can click the using this at the right click is equal to you can call the method so we're going to copy this and we are going to call at the rate click is equal to clear data so when this clear data is called so first we will do console.log to make sure that this event is called clear data perfectly fine so let's refresh this page so when i click clear data is called operating right now i'll select football cricket tennis and click on clear data that is empty tennis cricket football clear data add is empty so this is
