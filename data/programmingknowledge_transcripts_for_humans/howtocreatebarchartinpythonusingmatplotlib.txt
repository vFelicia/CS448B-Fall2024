00:00 - so in today's video i will be showing
00:01 - you how to use
00:03 - subplots to draw more than one plot
00:07 - and also in i will show you how to draw
00:11 - bar charts using the data
00:14 - so let me run the
00:17 - what we had done in the previous video
00:19 - so
00:20 - we had drawn this simple plot
00:24 - which has years from 1950 to 230
00:28 - and population billions in y-axis
00:32 - so we had drawn for indian population
00:34 - and chinese population
00:36 - so let me show you how to use subplots
00:40 - i will show you how to plot two subplots
00:43 - in the same adjacent plane
00:46 - so we'll first remove this xkcd function
00:51 - and let me use some style so we'll use
00:55 - ggplot for this video
00:58 - and you can just
01:03 - comment on the plant function plot
01:05 - function first
01:08 - and now the subplots are plotted as the
01:12 - way of matrix so
01:14 - if you want to plot three plots so
01:18 - what it does is three
01:21 - into one so that will be in the matrix
01:24 - form that is
01:26 - in the first row
01:30 - it will have three plots
01:34 - and it will have first slop subplot
01:38 - so like that in the matrix format it
01:40 - will be like
01:41 - two and one three and three
01:45 - so these are passed as parameters to the
01:49 - subplot function so
01:52 - let me just show you so type
01:55 - pld dot subplot so
01:59 - in that we'll pass our first one
02:02 - row and we'll display two subplots
02:07 - to comma
02:13 - first subplot okay this is like indexing
02:17 - so we'll give the plot function now
02:22 - and inside that will pass over here
02:27 - comma population population of china
02:31 - comma label
02:34 - equal to
02:49 - okay so we'll give plot
02:53 - title that will be
02:58 - support one
03:04 - and our x label available we will
03:07 - give it as year and
03:11 - a valuable would be population millions
03:16 - so
03:18 - same we will type it for subplot two
03:24 - in that will pass one comma
03:27 - second subplot comma
03:33 - and we'll type plt dot plot function
03:38 - and that will pass here
03:43 - comma population of india
03:46 - comma label equal to
03:54 - india comma color
03:59 - equal to green
04:03 - so remember we have to pass the legend
04:05 - function on top also
04:08 - below the first subplot
04:12 - and we'll type title so plt dot
04:17 - title will give it is
04:21 - subplot to
04:25 - just copy the x label and y label from
04:27 - top
04:29 - okay you will see you end with done
04:34 - so as you can see we got two subplots
04:40 - and in one we have china and another one
04:43 - is
04:43 - india we have yeah but you can see that
04:47 - uh
04:48 - one is little bit bigger and one is
04:50 - little smaller the grid function
04:54 - this is i think the due to the values
04:56 - which are passed
05:00 - okay so this is how you plot two
05:03 - subplots
05:04 - side by side you can also try with
05:08 - different method like style that is 5 30
05:16 - 8 so let me see that how it looks
05:21 - okay so this this looks really nice
05:24 - so this is 538 style
05:31 - okay so we'll create a new file
05:35 - for bar charts
05:47 - yes and as you can see also it is to our
05:51 - git repository
05:53 - and also have uploaded for
05:56 - subplot
06:04 - we'll copy the data from our
06:08 - main file to the
06:11 - bar chart that is
06:14 - your population china india
06:17 - and you get the
06:21 - ending lines place it here
06:25 - okay
06:31 - we can just directly plot
06:34 - the bar chart using bar function and
06:37 - that will pass
06:38 - the same year in population of india
06:45 - labor equal to
06:51 - will pass india
06:55 - comma color
06:58 - equal to ukraine
07:02 - okay so same will copy
07:05 - paste it here and here we pass
07:09 - population of china
07:12 - and we make it label a china
07:18 - so
07:26 - if we now run this file
07:31 - we will get bar chart like this
07:36 - our china bar chart is showing perfectly
07:39 - but our green
07:41 - colored india's bar chart is like
07:45 - little bit showcasing this is actually
07:47 - happening because
07:49 - the china is china bar chart is
07:53 - overlaying on top of
07:55 - india's bar chart
08:00 - let me show you so
08:03 - for that we can use
08:08 - a method that is
08:12 - that uses offset to separate out the
08:16 - values but first what we will do is we
08:19 - will
08:20 - trim down our data so we'll all
08:23 - will only contain values from
08:27 - 2015
08:31 - 25 so all that will cancel out this
08:48 - okay so now it is done
08:52 - let me comment this out and run this
08:57 - it will give a bar chart
09:01 - okay so what if we want to
09:05 - draw one more
09:12 - we cannot see the green one
09:16 - it is overlaid by the this
09:19 - china's population so for that we have a
09:22 - method
09:24 - to overcome that so for that we have to
09:27 - use
09:28 - something called as width
09:32 - so by default it is zero point
09:37 - twenty five i guess okay
09:40 - and we also have to pass
09:46 - indices create
09:50 - variable qualities
09:54 - and in that past
09:59 - the function from numpy
10:02 - and p dot a range
10:06 - and it will contain the length
10:09 - of our
10:14 - this should actually come on top
10:18 - here
10:25 - so it should contain our year list
10:30 - okay so we have not
10:33 - imported numpy yet so just import it
10:40 - okay the numpy is imported and
10:45 - what we have to do is we have to pass
10:48 - the
10:50 - indices in each and every function
10:53 - of path so we'll type indexes
10:57 - comma here and again indexes
11:01 - come on here
11:04 - so if we run it again
11:09 - it's a full red color because these
11:12 - indices are not properly set
11:14 - up to work with our
11:19 - ears in particular so it is just giving
11:22 - us
11:22 - the index from zero to ten
11:27 - okay so what we'll do is
11:32 - here for first part we'll do
11:37 - indices minus width
11:42 - one second we'll keep it as same
11:45 - and we pass
11:52 - width equal to
11:56 - width so that the function will know
11:59 - that
12:00 - we have changed the width value
12:06 - and also we'll include
12:11 - just support
12:14 - our title in the next
12:32 - just paste it below
12:36 - okay
12:45 - type population comparison
12:51 - between media and
12:55 - china okay
12:58 - so if you run this now
13:03 - okay got an error
13:06 - it is saying what
13:12 - so we forgot to remove the here because
13:16 - we are already passing it through the
13:18 - indices
13:20 - so we remove here and
13:23 - also remove here and if we say
13:28 - run we can see
13:34 - indianapolis china comparison but years
13:37 - are still
13:38 - it is showing the synthesis so for that
13:41 - to work
13:43 - we have to pass a function called vit
13:48 - dot x takes so in that we have to pass
13:51 - x s parameter for that will pass
13:56 - our indices variable
14:00 - comma
14:13 - you can see our ears are
14:17 - shown here you can see the growth is
14:20 - increasing
14:25 - and actually at around towards 2022
14:32 - india is near to china
14:36 - in 25 to across to china i guess
14:42 - so this is how we plot a
14:45 - power chart a vertical bar chart
14:48 - actually
14:50 - so i will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so in today's video i will be showing you how to use subplots to draw more than one plot and also in i will show you how to draw bar charts using the data so let me run the what we had done in the previous video so we had drawn this simple plot which has years from 1950 to 230 and population billions in yaxis so we had drawn for indian population and chinese population so let me show you how to use subplots i will show you how to plot two subplots in the same adjacent plane so we'll first remove this xkcd function and let me use some style so we'll use ggplot for this video and you can just comment on the plant function plot function first and now the subplots are plotted as the way of matrix so if you want to plot three plots so what it does is three into one so that will be in the matrix form that is in the first row it will have three plots and it will have first slop subplot so like that in the matrix format it will be like two and one three and three so these are passed as parameters to the subplot function so let me just show you so type pld dot subplot so in that we'll pass our first one row and we'll display two subplots to comma first subplot okay this is like indexing so we'll give the plot function now and inside that will pass over here comma population population of china comma label equal to okay so we'll give plot title that will be support one and our x label available we will give it as year and a valuable would be population millions so same we will type it for subplot two in that will pass one comma second subplot comma and we'll type plt dot plot function and that will pass here comma population of india comma label equal to india comma color equal to green so remember we have to pass the legend function on top also below the first subplot and we'll type title so plt dot title will give it is subplot to just copy the x label and y label from top okay you will see you end with done so as you can see we got two subplots and in one we have china and another one is india we have yeah but you can see that uh one is little bit bigger and one is little smaller the grid function this is i think the due to the values which are passed okay so this is how you plot two subplots side by side you can also try with different method like style that is 5 30 8 so let me see that how it looks okay so this this looks really nice so this is 538 style okay so we'll create a new file for bar charts yes and as you can see also it is to our git repository and also have uploaded for subplot we'll copy the data from our main file to the bar chart that is your population china india and you get the ending lines place it here okay we can just directly plot the bar chart using bar function and that will pass the same year in population of india labor equal to will pass india comma color equal to ukraine okay so same will copy paste it here and here we pass population of china and we make it label a china so if we now run this file we will get bar chart like this our china bar chart is showing perfectly but our green colored india's bar chart is like little bit showcasing this is actually happening because the china is china bar chart is overlaying on top of india's bar chart let me show you so for that we can use a method that is that uses offset to separate out the values but first what we will do is we will trim down our data so we'll all will only contain values from 2015 25 so all that will cancel out this okay so now it is done let me comment this out and run this it will give a bar chart okay so what if we want to draw one more we cannot see the green one it is overlaid by the this china's population so for that we have a method to overcome that so for that we have to use something called as width so by default it is zero point twenty five i guess okay and we also have to pass indices create variable qualities and in that past the function from numpy and p dot a range and it will contain the length of our this should actually come on top here so it should contain our year list okay so we have not imported numpy yet so just import it okay the numpy is imported and what we have to do is we have to pass the indices in each and every function of path so we'll type indexes comma here and again indexes come on here so if we run it again it's a full red color because these indices are not properly set up to work with our ears in particular so it is just giving us the index from zero to ten okay so what we'll do is here for first part we'll do indices minus width one second we'll keep it as same and we pass width equal to width so that the function will know that we have changed the width value and also we'll include just support our title in the next just paste it below okay type population comparison between media and china okay so if you run this now okay got an error it is saying what so we forgot to remove the here because we are already passing it through the indices so we remove here and also remove here and if we say run we can see indianapolis china comparison but years are still it is showing the synthesis so for that to work we have to pass a function called vit dot x takes so in that we have to pass x s parameter for that will pass our indices variable comma you can see our ears are shown here you can see the growth is increasing and actually at around towards 2022 india is near to china in 25 to across to china i guess so this is how we plot a power chart a vertical bar chart actually so i will see you in the next video
