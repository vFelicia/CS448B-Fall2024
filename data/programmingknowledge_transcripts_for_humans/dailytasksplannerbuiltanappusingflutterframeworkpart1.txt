00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so
00:03 - up until here we have covered
00:06 - all the fundamentals of flutter and we
00:09 - are well acquired
00:10 - to develop a basic to intermediate level
00:13 - apps
00:14 - now we are going to develop a
00:17 - daily task manager application
00:21 - and that is a rather a very simple
00:24 - application and that will mark the
00:26 - end of this series so let's
00:29 - start first of all i'll delete all the
00:32 - extra things i had let's
00:35 - get this project back as it was when we
00:38 - first created it
00:41 - so i'll remove all these things
00:46 - okay save it in main also i'll remove
00:49 - all the code
00:50 - let's code it from scratch
01:00 - and i also need to remove the assets
01:02 - folder
01:05 - and along with that i would also need to
01:08 - comment
01:09 - this out and so i did
01:26 - okay so now over here you can see we are
01:29 - getting an
01:30 - error and this error generally happens
01:32 - because when we delete
01:34 - some file while the project is
01:37 - running so i'll comment this out first
01:41 - and then restart that
01:46 - so run without debugging a test
01:56 - now let's start i'll first create a
01:59 - folder that will be screens
02:02 - and then in the screens we'll first have
02:06 - a home screen
02:09 - dot dot
02:13 - now let's first of all import material
02:17 - that is the most important thing
02:28 - then we'll first start with our
02:30 - stateless widget and we'll convert it to
02:32 - a stateful widget
02:33 - if needed so here is the
02:37 - home screen okay now it will have a root
02:41 - name
02:41 - that is like in the boiler code
02:46 - so static const
02:53 - root name and that is
02:56 - home screen
03:00 - and now in my main dot dot i'll import
03:03 - it
03:04 - and that is like writing the code that i
03:06 - have just commented and that i have just
03:08 - removed
03:10 - so we'll always use refer uh
03:14 - relative referencing while importing any
03:16 - package screens and then
03:18 - home screen now over here the
03:21 - home
03:24 - will be home screen
03:35 - okay so over here first we need to save
03:37 - this
03:41 - and then save this as well so now over
03:44 - here it will be a
03:46 - scaffold
03:50 - and then let's add a simple app bar
03:57 - the app bar has our title
04:03 - that takes our text widget and the text
04:06 - widget says
04:10 - task manager
04:14 - neat now and body
04:18 - i don't think like right now we need to
04:22 - add anybody
04:23 - first we need to add the feature to
04:25 - create
04:26 - tasks and then only will be able to show
04:29 - tasks and showing tasks
04:31 - go in the home screen so center
04:36 - simply a child with a text within that
04:39 - says
04:41 - not tasks
04:44 - added yet
04:49 - cool now let's add the root
04:52 - the button or clicking on which we will
04:55 - be able to create a
04:58 - task so the best option would be to
05:01 - create a floating action button
05:04 - and that will take a floating action
05:06 - button with chat
05:16 - i am sorry so this will take a floating
05:19 - action
05:21 - and then over here the child will be an
05:24 - icon
05:25 - icon with checked and then over here
05:28 - we'll use the icons
05:29 - in them and then the add
05:32 - button that is the plus sign okay
05:35 - now i'll give this icon a color of white
05:43 - let's format this then after that we
05:47 - have the background
05:49 - color so the color is let's decide a
05:52 - theme i am thinking we can go with
05:55 - yellow you can try anything else of your
05:58 - choice
06:00 - so this is yellow and then this will
06:03 - this is showing yellow underline because
06:06 - the on pressed parameter is required so
06:09 - let's
06:09 - add that on pressed and
06:13 - for now simply print
06:17 - fab pressed
06:20 - let's format this hot
06:24 - restart this
06:29 - cool and it is giving us an error
06:32 - nullcheck operator used uh
06:35 - null value in main line eight
06:40 - well this seems fine to me i don't know
06:43 - where the error
06:44 - actually is
06:48 - well that was not an error
06:51 - that was just
06:54 - some kind of uh last laps
06:57 - that happened in that okay so right now
07:00 - i'll remove the
07:02 - debug banner debug your checked banner
07:04 - that is false
07:07 - let's save this now my app bars
07:11 - or let's make the entire theme blue that
07:14 - will be easier because the default
07:16 - theme of flutter is blue so colors
07:20 - blue let's save this
07:24 - and now if i click on this the
07:27 - on pressed method is working fine now
07:30 - what we want to do
07:31 - here is that whenever we click on that
07:34 - button it opens a new screen and over
07:36 - there we
07:36 - add the task or what would be better is
07:41 - that instead of opening a new screen we
07:43 - can open a bottom sheet
07:45 - okay since the last video was on bottom
07:47 - sheets it makes complete sense that we
07:49 - use
07:50 - bottom sheet instead of a new screen but
07:52 - if you want you can use a new screen
07:54 - also that is there is no such kind of
07:59 - design technique or rule that restricts
08:01 - from using a new screen
08:03 - okay so i'll simply write
08:07 - show model
08:10 - bottom sheet
08:13 - now it needs a context the context is
08:16 - context
08:18 - and then it has a builder the every
08:21 - builder always has a build
08:24 - context
08:26 - and for now i'm sorry i was coding in
08:30 - javascript last night and for now let's
08:33 - simply return a container
08:38 - okay a container of height
08:41 - let's say 500 and color
08:46 - let's say colors dot blue
08:51 - cool let's save this
08:54 - and now if i click on this i am able to
08:57 - see a
08:58 - bottom sheet so let's not decide its
09:01 - height
09:04 - let's create the child and child will of
09:08 - course be a column
09:10 - because we are gonna add things one
09:12 - after another then it has a children the
09:14 - first one will be text
09:18 - that says add a task
09:26 - and task now it is looking very weird
09:30 - i'll maybe reduce the background color
09:33 - little bit let's see
09:39 - maybe little bit more
09:47 - okay it looks better than what it was
09:51 - earlier we
09:53 - will of course be changing designs later
09:57 - okay so let's add some style
10:00 - now i was thinking let's add a custom
10:03 - font so for that i'll go to
10:05 - fonts google.com and decide a font
10:08 - and in the meantime i'll search for
10:12 - google fonts
10:16 - flutter this is a package we're using
10:18 - which we can use all the
10:20 - fonts that are available on google fonts
10:23 - so
10:24 - either you can go in the installing
10:26 - section copy and paste or there is a
10:28 - shortcut you simply click on this
10:30 - and then in your pubspec dot email you
10:33 - have to
10:34 - paste it below cupertino icons i
10:37 - paste it and i saved it
10:42 - remove this for now
10:46 - so now let's uh fix on a
10:50 - font and maybe
10:53 - we can go with i think we should go with
10:56 - montessori okay so let's
11:00 - start adding the text
11:03 - all the text in this app will be in
11:05 - montis rat
11:07 - font okay so let's wait for this
11:11 - flutter puff get to complete okay so it
11:14 - is
11:15 - now i'll add the import import
11:19 - google fonts now the first text we can
11:23 - see over here the spelling is wrong as
11:25 - well
11:27 - task
11:30 - now in style we simply write to google
11:34 - fonts dot
11:38 - mont serrat so now since we don't
11:42 - have any configuration to add inside
11:44 - we'll leave it like this
11:47 - format it
11:51 - now over here also i'll add style
11:58 - google fonts dot montesseract
12:10 - and then over here i'll
12:14 - change the color i want the color
12:17 - to be white and the
12:20 - size to be
12:24 - 20 let's see now let's save this
12:49 - now after that over here we can see the
12:52 - font has changed to lotto
12:55 - okay and over here also the this font is
12:58 - also
12:59 - lotto now we also have our text in
13:03 - center we'll change that later
13:07 - okay so the first first
13:11 - text is add task now after that i
13:14 - believe that this add task should be
13:17 - over here and a cross button over here
13:20 - which when we click on this modal sheet
13:23 - should close however it will close if
13:25 - you
13:26 - click anywhere else then
13:30 - the model sheet okay so let's do that
13:33 - i'll wrap this text inside a row
13:37 - okay and then i'll give the main axis
13:40 - alignment as
13:41 - space between
13:47 - neat now after that
13:50 - i'll have a icon
13:54 - the icon will be from the icon cinema
13:57 - and the name is icons close that is the
13:59 - cross
14:00 - sign okay so
14:04 - now this is done now i'll add a gesture
14:08 - detector upon it
14:10 - rapid reject and that is
14:13 - gesture detector so now this gesture
14:17 - detector widget it gives you the
14:21 - triggers for all the gestures that we do
14:24 - on a screen that is a single tap a
14:26 - double tap a triple tap a long
14:29 - tap or double long tap and all those
14:31 - things
14:32 - okay so for now i'll use on tap
14:40 - now over here it should simply close the
14:43 - model sheet and we for that we simply
14:46 - write navigator dot pop
14:49 - navigator dot i'm sorry navigator
14:53 - dot off context what's happened
14:58 - dot pop cool
15:02 - now you might be thinking why didn't i
15:04 - use an icon button over here so
15:06 - that is because icon button comes with a
15:09 - inbuilt padding that we explicitly have
15:12 - to remove and that will
15:14 - that will be actually four lines of code
15:16 - and over here it is
15:17 - only two lines of code so this is a
15:20 - better choice
15:21 - less number of less lines of code means
15:25 - a better code so now we have it here and
15:28 - this but we definitely need some
15:32 - padding over here so this container over
15:36 - here the
15:36 - main container the parent container will
15:39 - have a padding
15:40 - and then we should always write const
15:43 - before padding
15:44 - or margin i have already discussed about
15:46 - it you can look to the previous
15:48 - videos edge insets
15:52 - dot all sorry not hundred point zero but
15:57 - ten point zero let's save this
16:00 - now first i need to close this open
16:02 - again and then it has a padding a decent
16:05 - padding and that is it now after
16:08 - rowing can add our divider
16:12 - [Music]
16:17 - now let's save this and we should be
16:20 - able to see our divider
16:22 - and we have our divider if you look very
16:25 - closely i'll i'll
16:28 - change that so the width or we have
16:32 - something like that
16:33 - to see all the available parameters you
16:35 - can simply click on control space
16:38 - and then over here yes we have height so
16:40 - i'll make it
16:42 - 1.2 just
16:45 - for testing let's see how it looks
16:50 - and this has become
16:54 - i have make it 10 let's see
17:00 - and damn it's not changing
17:06 - okay so that is not height we need to
17:08 - change the thickness i am sorry
17:10 - this kind of stuffs stuffs generally
17:13 - happen when you develop
17:14 - something there are plenty of widgets
17:17 - and you often get
17:18 - confused so there is no
17:21 - this is not such that bad thing okay so
17:24 - now it is a bit thicker and this looks
17:26 - fine
17:27 - i will be after subsequently upgrading
17:31 - the uis
17:32 - and discussing it with you for now this
17:34 - will do
17:37 - now i don't need a comma here since we
17:39 - only have
17:40 - one parameter inside that so that is the
17:43 - basic that is a good practice actually
17:47 - that if you have a single parameter you
17:49 - don't give a comma if you have
17:50 - any if you have any number of parameters
17:53 - which are more than one you do give a
17:55 - comma
17:56 - okay so this is done now after that i'll
17:59 - leave
18:00 - some space sized box
18:04 - okay and the space will be of
18:07 - let's say 20 now after that i'll have a
18:11 - text
18:12 - field
18:15 - okay let's see
18:21 - so we have a text field over here but it
18:23 - looks very very weird
18:25 - okay so let's design this
18:29 - so it also takes a decoration that
18:31 - decoration takes a input decoration
18:36 - now first for the border i'll use an
18:40 - outline input border
18:43 - okay now this
18:47 - outline input border has a few things
18:49 - border radius that is the curve around
18:51 - the corners
18:53 - so for that we have another widget
18:55 - border radius
18:56 - dot circular and simply 5.0 would do
19:02 - now after that we have a border side
19:05 - means that over here in outline input
19:08 - border we give one border sides and that
19:09 - is copied for all the four borders of
19:11 - our
19:12 - input field so simply
19:15 - border side
19:19 - and the borders color will be colors
19:22 - dot blue
19:29 - cool let's see so we have the border
19:33 - over here now let's add a
19:35 - white color in between
19:39 - okay so that is the fill color
19:43 - and the color needs to be white
19:48 - and filled should be true
19:52 - for the fill color to show
19:55 - it's failed yes
19:59 - true it was going to become true
20:05 - let's save this
20:10 - and after that so it is white in between
20:13 - now let's add a hint
20:17 - so the hint text is in text takes a
20:21 - string or a text widget and it takes a
20:23 - string
20:26 - enter task
20:29 - and then again we have a hint style and
20:32 - the hint style will go with
20:34 - google fonts dot
20:37 - mon to select
20:42 - okay now let this red line go actually
20:46 - in real time connects with the internet
20:49 - that is what i am guessing
20:51 - for such kind of behavior i am not sure
20:53 - about it
20:55 - let's save this anyhow
21:04 - okay i don't know why it is acting weird
21:07 - let's give it a minute
21:15 - oh sorry the spelling is wrong
21:18 - google fonts i'm extremely sorry the
21:21 - spelling was wrong and i thought it is
21:22 - some kind of a weird issue
21:26 - so this is also not that bad a thing
21:29 - okay so hint style and that is simple
21:33 - latto now i can add some task i can
21:36 - write the task over here now we need to
21:38 - have a complete
21:39 - button so so i'll
21:42 - instead of having a single complete
21:45 - button i'll have two buttons one is a
21:47 - reset button and the other one is the
21:50 - add button means that means add this
21:52 - task today
21:54 - for today okay so below this text field
21:58 - i'll have a
22:00 - row
22:06 - okay the rows children the children
22:09 - there are two children that is
22:12 - sorry we don't have simple button we
22:14 - have
22:16 - raised button
22:25 - now the child is text
22:29 - reset
22:32 - with a style of google
22:36 - fonts not
22:39 - montesseract
22:43 - so we need to give parentheses after
22:46 - that
22:48 - and we have on pressed
22:53 - and this on pressed for now we'll simply
22:57 - print
23:00 - the set pressed
23:05 - now let's format this now i'll have
23:07 - another button like this so instead of
23:09 - copying i'll
23:11 - click shift option and arrow key down
23:15 - so then it go gets copied
23:19 - save now over here instead of reset it
23:21 - will be add
23:23 - and over here also it will be at let's
23:25 - save this
23:26 - c and it looks
23:30 - completely atrocious so
23:33 - we need to fix that
23:40 - sized box
23:44 - a height of 20 would do
23:51 - now let's fix this so how how do we fix
23:54 - this
23:56 - well there are two methods
23:59 - i'll say first i'll wrap
24:02 - this with a sized box
24:09 - and the size box will have a width that
24:12 - is the
24:12 - entire width media query
24:16 - dot of context dot size
24:20 - dot width and height of
24:24 - let's say for now 200 we'll
24:27 - definitely reduce it to as much as it is
24:29 - required
24:31 - okay so now this raised button goes
24:33 - inside a
24:34 - container okay the container has a width
24:39 - of media
24:42 - query dot off
24:46 - context dot size
24:49 - and dot width divided by 2 means half
24:52 - the screen size
24:54 - and then this entire thing minus 10 that
24:56 - will be
24:58 - added for the padding the padding will
25:00 - be
25:01 - 5 because 10 divided by 2 from for both
25:04 - the sides
25:06 - minus 10 okay
25:09 - so this is fine now same i'll do for
25:12 - here
25:13 - with a container the container has a
25:17 - width
25:18 - of this cool
25:21 - now in this raised button let's add a
25:23 - background color
25:25 - or we simply call it color
25:29 - colors dot blue
25:32 - and here it should be color is
25:35 - colors dot white
25:40 - now let's see what is left
25:44 - instead of size box we'll have a
25:47 - container and then this container will
25:49 - have a padding from all the sides
25:50 - padding off
25:53 - sorry not size padding of const
25:58 - as inserts dot symmetric
26:04 - horizontal and that is
26:08 - 10.0 let's see if
26:12 - it gives us some overflow errors or what
26:16 - and yes it does so the
26:20 - size of this buttons are apparently big
26:23 - and they are big by 20 pixels as i
26:27 - guessed
26:28 - my calculation was a bit a little bit
26:30 - wrong
26:31 - this should be five
26:35 - okay and now let's see
26:41 - so still the error is there but it has
26:44 - reduced
26:45 - so better we add make it
26:49 - 20 make it 20
26:53 - for both save
26:57 - and then this is fine now you open the
27:00 - mobile on any screen
27:01 - now you open sorry not the mobile you
27:04 - open the app on
27:05 - any screen size this will look
27:08 - same because we are using dynamic width
27:11 - over here okay so now i don't think this
27:15 - 20 needs to be there it should be
27:18 - a mere eight
27:25 - okay i don't know why it is not changing
27:27 - oh because
27:29 - the sorry because the height is 200
27:32 - which is not at all recorded i don't
27:34 - think we need a height at all
27:38 - let's save and see
27:41 - yes so this looks fine when i click on
27:44 - reset reset is pressed when i click on
27:46 - add add express now i don't need
27:48 - this height also over here so
27:51 - where we started the model sheet
27:56 - the hi this is okay so the height was
27:59 - commented
28:00 - that means this is the default height
28:02 - now i am gonna
28:04 - force some height to it that is gonna be
28:08 - 300 let's see and 300 is also more
28:14 - than required i i'll make it 250.
28:18 - now let's see so this looks good now
28:22 - apparently there is a better color for
28:25 - the background than the color
28:26 - it is right now we will discuss that
28:28 - later for now
28:30 - our adding our task
28:33 - ui is complete okay so let's continue
28:36 - this in the next video
28:38 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to programming knowledge so up until here we have covered all the fundamentals of flutter and we are well acquired to develop a basic to intermediate level apps now we are going to develop a daily task manager application and that is a rather a very simple application and that will mark the end of this series so let's start first of all i'll delete all the extra things i had let's get this project back as it was when we first created it so i'll remove all these things okay save it in main also i'll remove all the code let's code it from scratch and i also need to remove the assets folder and along with that i would also need to comment this out and so i did okay so now over here you can see we are getting an error and this error generally happens because when we delete some file while the project is running so i'll comment this out first and then restart that so run without debugging a test now let's start i'll first create a folder that will be screens and then in the screens we'll first have a home screen dot dot now let's first of all import material that is the most important thing then we'll first start with our stateless widget and we'll convert it to a stateful widget if needed so here is the home screen okay now it will have a root name that is like in the boiler code so static const root name and that is home screen and now in my main dot dot i'll import it and that is like writing the code that i have just commented and that i have just removed so we'll always use refer uh relative referencing while importing any package screens and then home screen now over here the home will be home screen okay so over here first we need to save this and then save this as well so now over here it will be a scaffold and then let's add a simple app bar the app bar has our title that takes our text widget and the text widget says task manager neat now and body i don't think like right now we need to add anybody first we need to add the feature to create tasks and then only will be able to show tasks and showing tasks go in the home screen so center simply a child with a text within that says not tasks added yet cool now let's add the root the button or clicking on which we will be able to create a task so the best option would be to create a floating action button and that will take a floating action button with chat i am sorry so this will take a floating action and then over here the child will be an icon icon with checked and then over here we'll use the icons in them and then the add button that is the plus sign okay now i'll give this icon a color of white let's format this then after that we have the background color so the color is let's decide a theme i am thinking we can go with yellow you can try anything else of your choice so this is yellow and then this will this is showing yellow underline because the on pressed parameter is required so let's add that on pressed and for now simply print fab pressed let's format this hot restart this cool and it is giving us an error nullcheck operator used uh null value in main line eight well this seems fine to me i don't know where the error actually is well that was not an error that was just some kind of uh last laps that happened in that okay so right now i'll remove the debug banner debug your checked banner that is false let's save this now my app bars or let's make the entire theme blue that will be easier because the default theme of flutter is blue so colors blue let's save this and now if i click on this the on pressed method is working fine now what we want to do here is that whenever we click on that button it opens a new screen and over there we add the task or what would be better is that instead of opening a new screen we can open a bottom sheet okay since the last video was on bottom sheets it makes complete sense that we use bottom sheet instead of a new screen but if you want you can use a new screen also that is there is no such kind of design technique or rule that restricts from using a new screen okay so i'll simply write show model bottom sheet now it needs a context the context is context and then it has a builder the every builder always has a build context and for now i'm sorry i was coding in javascript last night and for now let's simply return a container okay a container of height let's say 500 and color let's say colors dot blue cool let's save this and now if i click on this i am able to see a bottom sheet so let's not decide its height let's create the child and child will of course be a column because we are gonna add things one after another then it has a children the first one will be text that says add a task and task now it is looking very weird i'll maybe reduce the background color little bit let's see maybe little bit more okay it looks better than what it was earlier we will of course be changing designs later okay so let's add some style now i was thinking let's add a custom font so for that i'll go to fonts google.com and decide a font and in the meantime i'll search for google fonts flutter this is a package we're using which we can use all the fonts that are available on google fonts so either you can go in the installing section copy and paste or there is a shortcut you simply click on this and then in your pubspec dot email you have to paste it below cupertino icons i paste it and i saved it remove this for now so now let's uh fix on a font and maybe we can go with i think we should go with montessori okay so let's start adding the text all the text in this app will be in montis rat font okay so let's wait for this flutter puff get to complete okay so it is now i'll add the import import google fonts now the first text we can see over here the spelling is wrong as well task now in style we simply write to google fonts dot mont serrat so now since we don't have any configuration to add inside we'll leave it like this format it now over here also i'll add style google fonts dot montesseract and then over here i'll change the color i want the color to be white and the size to be 20 let's see now let's save this now after that over here we can see the font has changed to lotto okay and over here also the this font is also lotto now we also have our text in center we'll change that later okay so the first first text is add task now after that i believe that this add task should be over here and a cross button over here which when we click on this modal sheet should close however it will close if you click anywhere else then the model sheet okay so let's do that i'll wrap this text inside a row okay and then i'll give the main axis alignment as space between neat now after that i'll have a icon the icon will be from the icon cinema and the name is icons close that is the cross sign okay so now this is done now i'll add a gesture detector upon it rapid reject and that is gesture detector so now this gesture detector widget it gives you the triggers for all the gestures that we do on a screen that is a single tap a double tap a triple tap a long tap or double long tap and all those things okay so for now i'll use on tap now over here it should simply close the model sheet and we for that we simply write navigator dot pop navigator dot i'm sorry navigator dot off context what's happened dot pop cool now you might be thinking why didn't i use an icon button over here so that is because icon button comes with a inbuilt padding that we explicitly have to remove and that will that will be actually four lines of code and over here it is only two lines of code so this is a better choice less number of less lines of code means a better code so now we have it here and this but we definitely need some padding over here so this container over here the main container the parent container will have a padding and then we should always write const before padding or margin i have already discussed about it you can look to the previous videos edge insets dot all sorry not hundred point zero but ten point zero let's save this now first i need to close this open again and then it has a padding a decent padding and that is it now after rowing can add our divider now let's save this and we should be able to see our divider and we have our divider if you look very closely i'll i'll change that so the width or we have something like that to see all the available parameters you can simply click on control space and then over here yes we have height so i'll make it 1.2 just for testing let's see how it looks and this has become i have make it 10 let's see and damn it's not changing okay so that is not height we need to change the thickness i am sorry this kind of stuffs stuffs generally happen when you develop something there are plenty of widgets and you often get confused so there is no this is not such that bad thing okay so now it is a bit thicker and this looks fine i will be after subsequently upgrading the uis and discussing it with you for now this will do now i don't need a comma here since we only have one parameter inside that so that is the basic that is a good practice actually that if you have a single parameter you don't give a comma if you have any if you have any number of parameters which are more than one you do give a comma okay so this is done now after that i'll leave some space sized box okay and the space will be of let's say 20 now after that i'll have a text field okay let's see so we have a text field over here but it looks very very weird okay so let's design this so it also takes a decoration that decoration takes a input decoration now first for the border i'll use an outline input border okay now this outline input border has a few things border radius that is the curve around the corners so for that we have another widget border radius dot circular and simply 5.0 would do now after that we have a border side means that over here in outline input border we give one border sides and that is copied for all the four borders of our input field so simply border side and the borders color will be colors dot blue cool let's see so we have the border over here now let's add a white color in between okay so that is the fill color and the color needs to be white and filled should be true for the fill color to show it's failed yes true it was going to become true let's save this and after that so it is white in between now let's add a hint so the hint text is in text takes a string or a text widget and it takes a string enter task and then again we have a hint style and the hint style will go with google fonts dot mon to select okay now let this red line go actually in real time connects with the internet that is what i am guessing for such kind of behavior i am not sure about it let's save this anyhow okay i don't know why it is acting weird let's give it a minute oh sorry the spelling is wrong google fonts i'm extremely sorry the spelling was wrong and i thought it is some kind of a weird issue so this is also not that bad a thing okay so hint style and that is simple latto now i can add some task i can write the task over here now we need to have a complete button so so i'll instead of having a single complete button i'll have two buttons one is a reset button and the other one is the add button means that means add this task today for today okay so below this text field i'll have a row okay the rows children the children there are two children that is sorry we don't have simple button we have raised button now the child is text reset with a style of google fonts not montesseract so we need to give parentheses after that and we have on pressed and this on pressed for now we'll simply print the set pressed now let's format this now i'll have another button like this so instead of copying i'll click shift option and arrow key down so then it go gets copied save now over here instead of reset it will be add and over here also it will be at let's save this c and it looks completely atrocious so we need to fix that sized box a height of 20 would do now let's fix this so how how do we fix this well there are two methods i'll say first i'll wrap this with a sized box and the size box will have a width that is the entire width media query dot of context dot size dot width and height of let's say for now 200 we'll definitely reduce it to as much as it is required okay so now this raised button goes inside a container okay the container has a width of media query dot off context dot size and dot width divided by 2 means half the screen size and then this entire thing minus 10 that will be added for the padding the padding will be 5 because 10 divided by 2 from for both the sides minus 10 okay so this is fine now same i'll do for here with a container the container has a width of this cool now in this raised button let's add a background color or we simply call it color colors dot blue and here it should be color is colors dot white now let's see what is left instead of size box we'll have a container and then this container will have a padding from all the sides padding off sorry not size padding of const as inserts dot symmetric horizontal and that is 10.0 let's see if it gives us some overflow errors or what and yes it does so the size of this buttons are apparently big and they are big by 20 pixels as i guessed my calculation was a bit a little bit wrong this should be five okay and now let's see so still the error is there but it has reduced so better we add make it 20 make it 20 for both save and then this is fine now you open the mobile on any screen now you open sorry not the mobile you open the app on any screen size this will look same because we are using dynamic width over here okay so now i don't think this 20 needs to be there it should be a mere eight okay i don't know why it is not changing oh because the sorry because the height is 200 which is not at all recorded i don't think we need a height at all let's save and see yes so this looks fine when i click on reset reset is pressed when i click on add add express now i don't need this height also over here so where we started the model sheet the hi this is okay so the height was commented that means this is the default height now i am gonna force some height to it that is gonna be 300 let's see and 300 is also more than required i i'll make it 250. now let's see so this looks good now apparently there is a better color for the background than the color it is right now we will discuss that later for now our adding our task ui is complete okay so let's continue this in the next video thank you
