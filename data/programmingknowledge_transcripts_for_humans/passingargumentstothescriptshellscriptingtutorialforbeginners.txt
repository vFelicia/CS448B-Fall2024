00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we will be learning about how we can
00:04 - pass the parameters while running our
00:06 - script okay
00:07 - so let's start with this video okay so I
00:10 - have already opened up my vs code and
00:12 - you can also open it using the terminal
00:14 - or from here from applications also so
00:16 - right now we'll create a new file that
00:18 - is a
00:21 - arguments.sh okay I will write the
00:24 - hashbank or C Bank you can say
00:26 - whatever you want oh sorry
00:30 - bin bash okay now here uh what we will
00:35 - do I will run this script and I will
00:37 - pass some admins and parameters and we
00:39 - will use those parameters and do some
00:42 - manipulation in those things okay
00:45 - so before the starting the video let me
00:47 - tell you first thing like suppose I run
00:49 - this script this one command
00:50 - substitution or maybe say which
00:54 - script I have run hope yeah suppose this
00:57 - command substitution is one of the
00:58 - script so here I will pass some
01:00 - parameters like I will pass my name my
01:03 - number okay and my some something like
01:10 - country India so in these in these way
01:15 - we can pass the parameters okay and how
01:18 - we will access these parameters so you
01:21 - can access these parameters using like
01:24 - this like using Eco dollar one
01:29 - okay dollar one for the first parameter
01:31 - Eco dollar two for the second parameter
01:35 - Eco Dollar Tree for the third parameter
01:39 - so here you can access till dollar nine
01:41 - and dollar zero is reserved and it gives
01:45 - you the name of your script okay so this
01:49 - is the uh in this way you can uh work
01:52 - with the parameters
01:54 - and now what we have to do uh we will
01:57 - just
02:01 - save this file and what we will do we
02:03 - will just return this particular script
02:05 - I will just give the permissions to this
02:08 - CH mode plus X and
02:10 - 0 5 fragments.sh and I will clear the
02:14 - screen and I will just run those script
02:16 - 0 5
02:18 - okay done and now what I will do I will
02:20 - just pass some params like right I want
02:22 - to pass my name ayush okay I will pass
02:25 - my country India I will pass my number
02:28 - uh
02:30 - okay and then I will pass something uh
02:34 - like
02:37 - a shell tutorial I can write like this
02:42 - okay so when I will hit enter then you
02:45 - will see what happens so here you can
02:47 - see first line giving me the name of the
02:50 - script second line the second first
02:53 - parameter then third is the
02:55 - second parameter then my number and we
02:58 - are not getting the cell tutorial why
03:00 - because we have not used dollar four
03:03 - okay so we will use here Eco dollar 4
03:06 - and again I will run the same script
03:09 - okay now here you can see all the uh
03:15 - what we can say arguments we have got in
03:17 - these form okay so you have to also
03:20 - remember one thing here like if I am
03:22 - going to just uh pass the one parameter
03:25 - in this case the other will be
03:27 - ignored okay
03:30 - so here you can see others have been
03:31 - ignored that is nothing okay and if you
03:35 - want to give the like this
03:38 - suppose I want to find by one by full
03:41 - name like ice Kumar so if I will do this
03:45 - so now it will act like this will be act
03:47 - as a first parameter this will be active
03:49 - second parameter so to act like to use
03:52 - this as a one parameter you can use this
03:55 - okay so now you will get this okay
03:59 - output okay so I hope you got it how you
04:02 - can work with the parameters and now
04:04 - moving forward uh if you want to get the
04:06 - uh list of all the parameter you pass so
04:10 - there are the some spatial uh characters
04:12 - or yeah you can say characters so how
04:16 - we'll use to print all the arguments we
04:17 - will use dollar at the rate
04:20 - and now it will print all the arguments
04:22 - which you will pass so what I will do I
04:24 - will run these escape this one and here
04:27 - you can see I have got the all the
04:28 - arguments which we have passed like I
04:30 - use India number Excel tutorial okay and
04:33 - also there is one more like
04:36 - Eco dollar hash to get how many number
04:40 - of parameters we have passed
04:42 - or this one dollar hash
04:44 - okay
04:45 - so again just to clear the screen and I
04:49 - will run this script and here we can see
04:51 - we have passed the four parameters yeah
04:53 - that's true okay now what we can do we
04:55 - can also store the value of these uh
04:58 - parameters which we pass in a variable
05:00 - suppose I want to store like name equal
05:02 - to
05:03 - dollar one and I will just remove these
05:06 - not available
06:01 - so that's all for today's guide I hope
06:03 - you liked it and I will meet you in the
06:05 - next video so thank you thank you guys
06:07 - for watching bye
