00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last video we have seen how to
00:06 - use file test operators in Shell
00:10 - scripting now in this video what we are
00:12 - going to do is we are going to uh you
00:15 - know consolidate our knowledge which we
00:18 - have uh gained in the last two videos
00:21 - that is if conditions and uh the file
00:24 - test operators and we will create some
00:27 - useful example from that so what uh in
00:31 - this video I'm going to show you is how
00:34 - we can uh you know write a script to
00:36 - append some text to a file which already
00:40 - exists okay so let's get started what
00:43 - I'm going to do is I'm going to just
00:46 - edit the code I have written in the last
00:48 - video so what I'm going to do is I'm
00:50 - going to just remove uh this code or let
00:54 - this code be there so first of all what
00:57 - I want to the user to do is I want the
01:00 - user to uh ask him to give uh the file
01:05 - name as we have seen in the last video
01:06 - so I will just Echo enter the name of
01:09 - the file and then whatever name he uh
01:12 - enters I will save it into this uh
01:16 - variable and then what I'm going to do
01:18 - is I'm going to check whether this file
01:21 - exist or not and it's a valid file or
01:24 - not so I will use the F flag for this
01:28 - and if this file exist then once again I
01:31 - will check whether I have the right
01:34 - permission to uh write some text into
01:37 - this file or not and then if I have the
01:40 - permission I will write into the file
01:43 - otherwise I will uh just uh show a
01:46 - message that this file doesn't have the
01:48 - right permission okay so uh in this if
01:53 - condition if uh this file exist what I
01:56 - will show is I will say file not exist
02:01 - and I'm going to remove uh this Echo uh
02:05 - statement from here and in here I'm
02:07 - going to add one more if condition or if
02:11 - statement so let's use uh the if
02:14 - statement so once again the if statement
02:18 - like this and then we will uh write the
02:22 - expression inside these uh square
02:25 - brackets and here we will write uh then
02:29 - and then we want to uh evaluate the
02:32 - condition and if the condition is true
02:33 - we will allow the user to append to this
02:36 - file using cat and if the you know write
02:40 - permissions are not okay then we will
02:43 - write some Echo message in the else
02:46 - condition right and then we will end
02:49 - this for if statement by fi okay so here
02:55 - we want to check whether the file has
02:58 - right condition so I will just give a
03:00 - space and then uh minus W and then uh
03:04 - the file name variable which is uh this
03:07 - one and this condition will check
03:10 - whether the file have the right
03:12 - permission or not so this variable name
03:15 - here and if you have haven't not noticed
03:18 - in if condition inside this expression
03:22 - uh you know square brackets I always
03:24 - provide a space after the square bracket
03:28 - and uh I always provide the space before
03:32 - the ending uh square brackets so if you
03:35 - don't do it maybe you will get some
03:38 - problems right so always provide this
03:41 - space and this space for your expression
03:44 - right so we have written this condition
03:47 - which checks uh if the file have the
03:49 - right permission or not and if this file
03:52 - have the right permission then what we
03:54 - want to do is we want to Echo first of
03:56 - all Echo and what we will Echo is is for
04:00 - example type some text so type some Text
04:05 - data for
04:07 - example and uh because we are going to
04:10 - use the cat command for this so we will
04:14 - say to quit we need to
04:18 - press control D yeah so Ctrl for control
04:24 - plus d so controll D if you don't know
04:28 - is the command which which we uh use to
04:31 - come out of uh the cat command Okay so
04:36 - this message we are going to show and
04:39 - then in the next line we will just say
04:42 - cat and then whatever file name we have
04:46 - we will uh you know append this data so
04:49 - for appending we use double redirection
04:53 - uh you know angle brackets if you use a
04:56 - single redirection angle bracket then
05:00 - your file will be overwritten and if you
05:03 - do double angle brackets then your file
05:07 - will be appended so whatever text you
05:09 - will write uh you know the text will be
05:12 - appended to the text the file already
05:16 - have okay and then comes your uh file
05:20 - name which is uh this name right so just
05:24 - copy it and paste it here so this is for
05:27 - appending the data otherwise
05:30 - we will just say Echo so just write Echo
05:35 - and then uh the file do not have right
05:40 - permissions okay so you can uh just Echo
05:44 - this uh message right so let's see uh if
05:49 - uh this example works or not so let's
05:52 - run the script and let's see if it works
05:55 - or not so script and then we will give
05:58 - the name of the file
06:00 - but file doesn't exist yet so let's say
06:04 - I give the name of the file test which
06:06 - does not exist so I will press enter and
06:09 - it says test does not exist right so we
06:13 - need to create the file so I'm going to
06:16 - just uh touch but first of all I will
06:19 - show you what uh I have in my desktop
06:22 - directory so I don't have this test file
06:24 - already so I will just use uh touch
06:27 - command to uh create this file test and
06:31 - then we will see the permission of it so
06:34 - just to LS minus a to check the
06:38 - permission of uh this uh directory files
06:42 - and you can see when we create this test
06:45 - file this have a read and write
06:48 - permission for the user and read and
06:50 - write permission for the group right so
06:54 - for example we will uh just remove the
06:57 - right permission from the this file and
07:00 - we will check whether this uh example
07:03 - works properly or not right so what I'm
07:06 - going to do is I'm going to just write
07:08 - CH mod for changing the permission and
07:12 - then I will do minus W which will remove
07:15 - the permission from the file which is
07:17 - writable permission minus w stand for
07:20 - writable permission uh and minus is for
07:23 - uh removing this permission right and
07:26 - then the name of the file and then press
07:28 - enter and once again do LS minus Al and
07:32 - you can see we don't have a writeable
07:36 - permission no long right so earlier it
07:39 - has the right permission but right now
07:42 - it doesn't have the right permissions
07:43 - right once again we will run our uh
07:46 - script so let's run the script and then
07:49 - once again give the test uh file name
07:53 - and then press enter and it says the
07:56 - file do not have right permission
07:58 - because we have already removed remove
07:59 - the right permission so it will not work
08:03 - right so let's uh give back the right
08:06 - permission it can be done by using CH
08:08 - mod plus W so plus W is for providing
08:13 - the right permission minus W is for
08:15 - removing the right permission so plus W
08:18 - and then once again check the permission
08:20 - for once again and you can see it has
08:22 - the uh right permission and lets me
08:25 - clear the terminal and we will run the
08:28 - script once again
08:29 - so let's run the script and then say
08:34 - test and now it says uh type some Text
08:38 - data to quit press controll D so now we
08:42 - are in the right you know condition here
08:45 - right so we can uh write some uh data
08:49 - here so for example let's write some
08:52 - data so let's uh write some uh
08:58 - data for example hello world and then to
09:01 - come out of this uh cat command we will
09:04 - press contrl D so I'm going to press
09:06 - contr D and I'm out of uh this uh cat
09:09 - command and now what I want to check is
09:13 - whether uh in my text file I have uh
09:17 - this text or not so I will just cat this
09:21 - text file so just cat test and you can
09:25 - see we have uh this uh text there okay
09:29 - or otherwise we can go to the desktop
09:31 - folder we can see this test file and we
09:34 - have this data there okay once again we
09:37 - will run the you know uh script and we
09:41 - will see whether uh we can append to
09:44 - this text some data or not so let's do
09:47 - it once again so I'm going to run the
09:52 - script once again and now I'm going to
09:55 - give the name of the uh test file and
09:59 - and let's see what we want to uh write
10:02 - here so for example I will just write
10:04 - shell scripting tutorial okay and then I
10:06 - will press uh contrl D for coming out of
10:10 - uh this command so controll D and let's
10:14 - see let's see if this file is uh you
10:17 - know uh updated or not so you can see
10:20 - reload and after reload this text is
10:23 - appended to the earlier text right so we
10:28 - have learned in this video how we can uh
10:31 - append data to a text file and we have
10:35 - seen nested if conditions so how to use
10:37 - nested if condition we have also seen in
10:40 - this video so I hope you enjoyed this
10:42 - video please rate comment and subscribe
10:44 - and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use file test operators in Shell scripting now in this video what we are going to do is we are going to uh you know consolidate our knowledge which we have uh gained in the last two videos that is if conditions and uh the file test operators and we will create some useful example from that so what uh in this video I'm going to show you is how we can uh you know write a script to append some text to a file which already exists okay so let's get started what I'm going to do is I'm going to just edit the code I have written in the last video so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just remove uh this code or let this code be there so first of all what I want to the user to do is I want the user to uh ask him to give uh the file name as we have seen in the last video so I will just Echo enter the name of the file and then whatever name he uh enters I will save it into this uh variable and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to check whether this file exist or not and it's a valid file or not so I will use the F flag for this and if this file exist then once again I will check whether I have the right permission to uh write some text into this file or not and then if I have the permission I will write into the file otherwise I will uh just uh show a message that this file doesn't have the right permission okay so uh in this if condition if uh this file exist what I will show is I will say file not exist and I'm going to remove uh this Echo uh statement from here and in here I'm going to add one more if condition or if statement so let's use uh the if statement so once again the if statement like this and then we will uh write the expression inside these uh square brackets and here we will write uh then and then we want to uh evaluate the condition and if the condition is true we will allow the user to append to this file using cat and if the you know write permissions are not okay then we will write some Echo message in the else condition right and then we will end this for if statement by fi okay so here we want to check whether the file has right condition so I will just give a space and then uh minus W and then uh the file name variable which is uh this one and this condition will check whether the file have the right permission or not so this variable name here and if you have haven't not noticed in if condition inside this expression uh you know square brackets I always provide a space after the square bracket and uh I always provide the space before the ending uh square brackets so if you don't do it maybe you will get some problems right so always provide this space and this space for your expression right so we have written this condition which checks uh if the file have the right permission or not and if this file have the right permission then what we want to do is we want to Echo first of all Echo and what we will Echo is is for example type some text so type some Text data for example and uh because we are going to use the cat command for this so we will say to quit we need to press control D yeah so Ctrl for control plus d so controll D if you don't know is the command which which we uh use to come out of uh the cat command Okay so this message we are going to show and then in the next line we will just say cat and then whatever file name we have we will uh you know append this data so for appending we use double redirection uh you know angle brackets if you use a single redirection angle bracket then your file will be overwritten and if you do double angle brackets then your file will be appended so whatever text you will write uh you know the text will be appended to the text the file already have okay and then comes your uh file name which is uh this name right so just copy it and paste it here so this is for appending the data otherwise we will just say Echo so just write Echo and then uh the file do not have right permissions okay so you can uh just Echo this uh message right so let's see uh if uh this example works or not so let's run the script and let's see if it works or not so script and then we will give the name of the file but file doesn't exist yet so let's say I give the name of the file test which does not exist so I will press enter and it says test does not exist right so we need to create the file so I'm going to just uh touch but first of all I will show you what uh I have in my desktop directory so I don't have this test file already so I will just use uh touch command to uh create this file test and then we will see the permission of it so just to LS minus a to check the permission of uh this uh directory files and you can see when we create this test file this have a read and write permission for the user and read and write permission for the group right so for example we will uh just remove the right permission from the this file and we will check whether this uh example works properly or not right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just write CH mod for changing the permission and then I will do minus W which will remove the permission from the file which is writable permission minus w stand for writable permission uh and minus is for uh removing this permission right and then the name of the file and then press enter and once again do LS minus Al and you can see we don't have a writeable permission no long right so earlier it has the right permission but right now it doesn't have the right permissions right once again we will run our uh script so let's run the script and then once again give the test uh file name and then press enter and it says the file do not have right permission because we have already removed remove the right permission so it will not work right so let's uh give back the right permission it can be done by using CH mod plus W so plus W is for providing the right permission minus W is for removing the right permission so plus W and then once again check the permission for once again and you can see it has the uh right permission and lets me clear the terminal and we will run the script once again so let's run the script and then say test and now it says uh type some Text data to quit press controll D so now we are in the right you know condition here right so we can uh write some uh data here so for example let's write some data so let's uh write some uh data for example hello world and then to come out of this uh cat command we will press contrl D so I'm going to press contr D and I'm out of uh this uh cat command and now what I want to check is whether uh in my text file I have uh this text or not so I will just cat this text file so just cat test and you can see we have uh this uh text there okay or otherwise we can go to the desktop folder we can see this test file and we have this data there okay once again we will run the you know uh script and we will see whether uh we can append to this text some data or not so let's do it once again so I'm going to run the script once again and now I'm going to give the name of the uh test file and and let's see what we want to uh write here so for example I will just write shell scripting tutorial okay and then I will press uh contrl D for coming out of uh this command so controll D and let's see let's see if this file is uh you know uh updated or not so you can see reload and after reload this text is appended to the earlier text right so we have learned in this video how we can uh append data to a text file and we have seen nested if conditions so how to use nested if condition we have also seen in this video so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate
