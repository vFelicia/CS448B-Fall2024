00:00 - today we are going to take a look at
00:02 - some of the important interview
00:05 - questions that can be asked from the C
00:08 - programming language so let's take a
00:11 - look first question is what is dynamic
00:17 - memory allocation increase so the answer
00:21 - is dynamic memory allocation is the
00:25 - process of allocating memory to the
00:28 - program and it's variable during runtime
00:31 - it involves three functions for
00:35 - allocating the memory and one function -
00:39 - free the used memory or the allocated so
00:43 - the three functions that are used to
00:45 - allocate the memory are malloc calloc
00:49 - and we allow the function that is used
00:53 - to reallocate the used memory is free
00:56 - all these functions have no parameters
01:01 - next question what do you mean by memory
01:05 - leak so memory leak can be defined as a
01:10 - situation where programmer allocates
01:13 - dynamic memory to the program but fails
01:17 - to free or delete the used memory after
01:20 - the completion of the code this is a
01:24 - harmful process if demons and servers
01:27 - are included in the program further if
01:30 - the memory is being allocated but is not
01:34 - being freed then it can cause a problem
01:38 - in the memory management so this is
01:41 - memory leak next question what is the
01:46 - difference between declaring a header
01:48 - file with angular brackets and double
01:51 - quotes if the header file is declared
01:56 - using the angular bracket then the
02:00 - compiler searches for the header file
02:02 - within the buildin part but if the
02:07 - header file is declared using the double
02:10 - hood
02:11 - then the compiler will search for the
02:14 - header file in the current working
02:16 - directory first and if it is not found
02:20 - over there then it searches for the file
02:22 - in the other location next question what
02:28 - is typecasting typecasting is a process
02:32 - of conversion of one data type into
02:36 - another it is a form of explicit
02:39 - conversion that is it is done after this
02:43 - choice and RIF of the user since that's
02:47 - what I casting is within thousand pieces
02:50 - you need to mention the target data type
02:53 - status the data type into which you want
02:57 - to convert your expression into and
03:00 - after that you write the expression and
03:03 - end the statement with a semicolon for
03:07 - example can pH is initialized with a so
03:13 - sweet is a character variable status
03:16 - holding the character capital it int Y
03:20 - is another integer variable in which we
03:23 - have casted this character variable so
03:28 - we have written int Val
03:31 - within parentheses int that is our
03:34 - target data type and then we have
03:37 - mentioned finish so this is explicit
03:40 - conversion using typecasting now one
03:44 - will do that type annual capital e which
03:48 - is nothing but 65 next question what is
03:54 - the hash fragment directive it is the
03:57 - preprocessor directive that can be used
04:00 - to turn on or off certain features in a
04:04 - C program it is a three type hash
04:08 - fragment start up hashtag Madrid and
04:12 - hash mark one hash tag must start up
04:17 - allows us to specify functions
04:20 - upon program starter that is when the
04:24 - program starts then what functions will
04:26 - be fired automatically hash fragment
04:30 - exit allows us to specify functions
04:33 - called upon the program equipped that is
04:36 - when the program is about to exit then
04:39 - what functions do we need to perform
04:42 - hash tag more warned tells whether to
04:45 - suppress any warning in the C program or
04:48 - not next question is what is null
04:53 - pointer in three nice is used to
04:57 - indicate that a pointer doesn't point to
05:01 - a valid location the pointers should be
05:05 - initialized as null if their value is
05:07 - unknown at the time of declaration or
05:10 - when the memory pointed by the pointer
05:14 - is being allocated within a program next
05:20 - question how will you print numbers from
05:23 - one to hundred without using a loop so
05:26 - we know that if we want to do something
05:28 - in a repeated fashion we use loop for
05:32 - that purpose but how can you print
05:35 - numbers from one to hundred without
05:37 - using a loop so one method is that you
05:42 - have to write the printf 1,800 times but
05:44 - thatís just a troublesome process so we
05:48 - have another process another method
05:51 - through which we can do so and that is
05:54 - known as recursion recursion is the
05:57 - repeated calling of a function by itself
06:00 - so here we have created a function whose
06:04 - return type is void the name of the
06:06 - function is print numbers and it accepts
06:10 - an integer argument n within the body of
06:13 - the function there is an if statement if
06:16 - n is greater than zero then it calls
06:20 - itself it calls
06:23 - print numbers and passes n minus 1 into
06:28 - it after the calling
06:31 - it will print the value of N so this
06:35 - print numbers function all itself and
06:39 - using that it will print the value of N
06:43 - and n will be supplied by the user so it
06:49 - is a recursive calling of prints numbers
06:51 - and using this we can print easily the
06:55 - numbers from one to hundred without
06:57 - using a loop so now we also know that
07:01 - using recursion anything that could be
07:04 - done through loop can be done easily
07:07 - next question what are local static
07:11 - variables and what is this use a local
07:16 - static variable is a variable whose
07:18 - lifetime doesn't end with a function
07:21 - call where it is declared extends for
07:25 - the lifetime of complete program all
07:29 - calls to the function share the same
07:31 - copy of local static variable static
07:36 - variables can be used to count the
07:39 - number of times of functional order the
07:43 - static variable with the default value
07:46 - as zero next question why preprocessor
07:53 - directive does not end with a semicolon
07:57 - so the answer is semicolons is treated
08:02 - by the compiler and as the name suggests
08:05 - the preprocessors are programs that
08:09 - preserves the source code before
08:11 - compilation even start therefore the use
08:16 - of semicolons in preprocessors is not
08:19 - needed next question what is the
08:24 - smallest possible executable code in a C
08:27 - programming language
08:29 - since the presence of main function is
08:33 - needed for a program to stop its
08:36 - execution for the smallest possible
08:40 - executable code in three it is mandatory
08:43 - to include a main function so the code
08:47 - will be void main parentheses open and
08:52 - close and graces open and close that
08:55 - means it will only contain a main
08:58 - function with parentheses but no
09:01 - arguments and no body so this code will
09:04 - be compiled on sue it would be executed
09:06 - also but it will not do anything this is
09:09 - a smallest possible equitable food in
09:12 - the C programming language so that's it
09:16 - thanks for watching
