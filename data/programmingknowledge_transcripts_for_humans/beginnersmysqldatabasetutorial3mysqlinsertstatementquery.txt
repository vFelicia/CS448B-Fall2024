00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how to create a
00:07 - new schema a new
00:09 - database using MySQL workbench and also
00:14 - with the help of query and we have also
00:17 - learned how to create a
00:20 - table inside your database in this video
00:25 - we will see how to insert values in your
00:30 - database table and some other
00:33 - things so let's get
00:37 - started first of
00:39 - all we made this database called
00:42 - database only so go here and click this
00:48 - and in this
00:50 - table the table name is e data I have
00:53 - changed the table
00:54 - name and just click right click this
00:59 - table and go to edit data so we will
01:03 - come up with our table with four columns
01:07 - we have created last time the First
01:10 - Column is employee ID second is name
01:13 - third is surname and fourth is
01:16 - age now we are going to insert some
01:19 - values
01:21 - in this table so just double click these
01:29 - cells
01:30 - and you can insert the column
01:34 - so
01:43 - Mark and his age
01:47 - 25
01:53 - second
01:57 - John his age
02:03 - 33
02:09 - third
02:15 - check his age is 40 for
02:19 - example and the fourth
02:21 - employee
02:25 - Jill and his age is 45
02:30 - so simply you can insert these values in
02:34 - your
02:35 - database and when you click when you're
02:39 - done with inserting click
02:42 - apply and in here comes the query insert
02:48 - into database
02:50 - dot e data which is our tail table name
02:56 - and then write your column in which you
02:58 - want to insert data and then the
03:02 - values
03:06 - so and then
03:08 - apply and our data is inserted
03:14 - successfully so if you go and right
03:18 - click and go to edit table once again
03:21 - our data is saved you can
03:25 - see
03:28 - now I want want to insert this data with
03:31 - the help of query so what I will do is I
03:35 - will select my second database which I
03:37 - use for inserting data with the help of
03:44 - queries so I will select
03:48 - this
03:49 - and in my query tab here I will
03:56 - write insert
04:07 - insert into your table name which is e
04:18 - data and
04:22 - then it's a better good practice
04:26 - to indicate your schema also so I will
04:31 - write database dot e data so it
04:36 - indicates that sorry 1 2 3 it indicates
04:41 - my database which is this database
04:44 - database 1 2 3 dot this table
04:49 - so it specifies my database and my table
04:55 - and then I will make
04:57 - brackets and
05:00 - The Columns in which I want to make
05:03 - changes so First Column
05:07 - is
05:12 - ID employee info comma SE second column
05:17 - is name third column
05:21 - is so name sorry
05:31 - so
05:33 - name
05:37 - and fourth column is
05:43 - age
05:45 - okay and
05:47 - then
05:50 - write
05:54 - values and once again make a bracket and
05:58 - close it and in here
06:00 - we will insert the values so first the
06:03 - employee ID or this ID so this is an
06:07 - integer I will write one comma name mark
06:12 - for example third column is surname I
06:15 - will write some
06:20 - surname and fourth column is AG so I
06:22 - will write 34 is his
06:26 - age so this is the
06:30 - in order to insert a first row in
06:34 - your
06:36 - database one to three and in the
06:40 - table e
06:42 - data this which is this and I will click
06:47 - this execute
06:49 - button and it
06:55 - says some
06:57 - error unknown column
07:01 - Mark so we will see why it's
07:09 - not so let's see what is the mistake
07:13 - here here I have written insert into
07:16 - database name dot my table name and in
07:21 - this bracket my column
07:23 - names and I have written values three
07:27 - and Mark and Bill
07:30 - these are
07:33 - characters
07:35 - so if you want to insert the character
07:38 - it cannot identify that it's a character
07:42 - so you have to surrounded by single
07:48 - quotes like
07:51 - this and now it identify that it's a
07:55 - Vare
07:58 - variable so now now when
08:01 - I execute my
08:08 - query it shows me duplicate entry
08:13 - because I will write four here because I
08:16 - have inserted already three values
08:19 - previously for testing my query so once
08:24 - again and yes it's
08:27 - saved you can see see
08:30 - here my green indication comes so it
08:34 - means that my query is
08:37 - executed so let's
08:40 - see my data is inserted or not
08:44 - yes this is the fourth column I have
08:48 - inserted and the error which comes
08:52 - previously is the duplicate entry for
08:55 - primary key because I have already
08:58 - inserted one 2 three so I have to insert
09:01 - fourth
09:04 - time so in this way you can insert data
09:08 - into table with the help of workbench
09:11 - also and with the help of this query
09:13 - also once again we will go to the query
09:16 - to insert a data into the table you need
09:20 - to write insert into database do table
09:24 - name your columns in which you want to
09:28 - enter your data and the values you want
09:32 - to enter and remember that if you want
09:37 - to insert Vare
09:40 - variable you need single codes
09:44 - surrounding that value or
09:48 - that data so keep in mind this and you
09:53 - will be good to go so I hope you have
09:56 - learned something new this time please
09:58 - write commented sub subscribe and bye
10:00 - for now

hello guys welcome once again in the last video we have seen how to create a new schema a new database using MySQL workbench and also with the help of query and we have also learned how to create a table inside your database in this video we will see how to insert values in your database table and some other things so let's get started first of all we made this database called database only so go here and click this and in this table the table name is e data I have changed the table name and just click right click this table and go to edit data so we will come up with our table with four columns we have created last time the First Column is employee ID second is name third is surname and fourth is age now we are going to insert some values in this table so just double click these cells and you can insert the column so Mark and his age 25 second John his age 33 third check his age is 40 for example and the fourth employee Jill and his age is 45 so simply you can insert these values in your database and when you click when you're done with inserting click apply and in here comes the query insert into database dot e data which is our tail table name and then write your column in which you want to insert data and then the values so and then apply and our data is inserted successfully so if you go and right click and go to edit table once again our data is saved you can see now I want want to insert this data with the help of query so what I will do is I will select my second database which I use for inserting data with the help of queries so I will select this and in my query tab here I will write insert insert into your table name which is e data and then it's a better good practice to indicate your schema also so I will write database dot e data so it indicates that sorry 1 2 3 it indicates my database which is this database database 1 2 3 dot this table so it specifies my database and my table and then I will make brackets and The Columns in which I want to make changes so First Column is ID employee info comma SE second column is name third column is so name sorry so name and fourth column is age okay and then write values and once again make a bracket and close it and in here we will insert the values so first the employee ID or this ID so this is an integer I will write one comma name mark for example third column is surname I will write some surname and fourth column is AG so I will write 34 is his age so this is the in order to insert a first row in your database one to three and in the table e data this which is this and I will click this execute button and it says some error unknown column Mark so we will see why it's not so let's see what is the mistake here here I have written insert into database name dot my table name and in this bracket my column names and I have written values three and Mark and Bill these are characters so if you want to insert the character it cannot identify that it's a character so you have to surrounded by single quotes like this and now it identify that it's a Vare variable so now now when I execute my query it shows me duplicate entry because I will write four here because I have inserted already three values previously for testing my query so once again and yes it's saved you can see see here my green indication comes so it means that my query is executed so let's see my data is inserted or not yes this is the fourth column I have inserted and the error which comes previously is the duplicate entry for primary key because I have already inserted one 2 three so I have to insert fourth time so in this way you can insert data into table with the help of workbench also and with the help of this query also once again we will go to the query to insert a data into the table you need to write insert into database do table name your columns in which you want to enter your data and the values you want to enter and remember that if you want to insert Vare variable you need single codes surrounding that value or that data so keep in mind this and you will be good to go so I hope you have learned something new this time please write commented sub subscribe and bye for now
