00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install Apache Cassandra
00:05 - on your Ubuntu operating system
00:07 - the prerequisite of installing Cassandra
00:10 - is you need to have Java installed on
00:13 - your Ubuntu operating system so just
00:15 - verify if Java is installed on your
00:18 - Ubuntu operating system
00:19 - just open the terminal by pressing Ctrl
00:22 - alt t
00:23 - or you can just go to your applications
00:27 - and then click on Terminal which is
00:28 - going to open the terminal and here you
00:31 - can verify the version of java by just
00:34 - giving Java hyphen hyphen version
00:36 - command and if it returns some version
00:39 - of java you're good to go so now let's
00:43 - go to our browser to install Cassandra
00:46 - so just open your favorite browser and
00:48 - search for install Cassandra and the
00:52 - first link which will appear here will
00:53 - be from
00:56 - cassandra.apache.org latest getting
00:59 - started link just click on this link and
01:03 - here you have the procedure of
01:07 - installing the Apache Cassandra on
01:10 - different
01:11 - operating system or different
01:13 - distributions right
01:15 - so prerequisite here is you need to have
01:18 - Java 8 or Java 11 installed
01:23 - so you can see Oracle Java standard 8
01:26 - Edition should be installed or Oracle
01:29 - standard edition 11 should be installed
01:33 - or you should have higher version than
01:36 - these two versions
01:38 - if you don't know how to install Java I
01:41 - have already created a video on
01:44 - installing Java on Ubuntu operating
01:46 - system I can put the link of that video
01:49 - also in the description so you can see
01:52 - how to install Java once you have Java
01:56 - installed you can move down where you
02:01 - will see installing the docker image
02:03 - which we don't want installing the
02:06 - binary tarball which we don't want
02:09 - but we want to install Cassandra using
02:13 - the Debian packages right the First
02:17 - Command we have already given and
02:20 - verified that Java is already installed
02:23 - on our Ubuntu operating system so we are
02:27 - going to go to the next command which is
02:29 - this Command right so I'm going to copy
02:34 - this whole command and in my terminal
02:37 - I'm going to paste this command and then
02:39 - press enter and give my ubuntu's
02:42 - password which I used to log into my
02:45 - Ubuntu operating system now it says this
02:49 - dab is not found why this is complaining
02:52 - about this because you can see on the
02:56 - Cassandra website uh
02:59 - this command is broken into two lines
03:03 - and this doesn't work right so let's fix
03:06 - that problem so just copy this command
03:08 - once again go to any editor of your
03:11 - choice and then just go to the second
03:14 - line and then
03:16 - press backspace here and then press
03:19 - space right so now we have added this
03:24 - dab in the same line as the whole
03:28 - Command right in this web page this line
03:32 - is on one line and then we have the
03:36 - second line whole command should be on
03:38 - one line right so that's what I have
03:42 - done so I have given space and then
03:44 - added this dab in the same line copy the
03:49 - command once again and I'm going to
03:51 - paste this command once again so I'm
03:53 - going to paste this command and then
03:55 - press enter and hopefully this will work
03:58 - so once that is done I'm going to clear
04:00 - my terminal
04:02 - and then move to the next command which
04:05 - is this command so let me copy this curl
04:09 - command
04:10 - I'm going to copy this and paste it into
04:13 - my terminal and it's going to fetch
04:15 - these Keys here let's move to the next
04:18 - command which is sudo apt-get update so
04:22 - I'm going to give this command here and
04:24 - then press enter which is going to
04:26 - Simply update the package indexes right
04:29 - once that is done the last command is to
04:33 - install Cassandra which is sudo apt-get
04:35 - install Cassandra I'm going to just
04:38 - paste this command into the terminal and
04:41 - then press enter
04:42 - and then press Y and then press enter
04:46 - and it's going to start the installation
04:49 - of Cassandra so once Cassandra is
04:51 - installed it's installed as a service on
04:56 - your Ubuntu operating system right so
05:00 - you can see Cassandra installation
05:02 - command is successful so I'm going to
05:05 - clear the terminal and now first of all
05:09 - we need to enable Cassandra and then we
05:13 - need to start the Cassandra if it's
05:15 - already not started by the installation
05:18 - command so for that you can first of all
05:21 - give this command sudo system CTL
05:25 - status and then Cassandra and then press
05:29 - enter
05:31 - and you can see right now the status of
05:34 - Cassandra service is its active and
05:37 - running if you see any other status like
05:42 - it's disabled or it's stopped or it's
05:46 - not active then let me show you what you
05:49 - can do so
05:51 - instead of checking the status you can
05:53 - enable Cassandra by giving this command
05:57 - which is just enable Cassandra right
06:01 - this go this is going to enable the
06:03 - Cassandra you can see customer service
06:05 - is not a native service redirecting this
06:08 - to this one
06:10 - because Cassandra is already enabled
06:14 - this hasn't done anything in my case but
06:17 - if it's not enabled it will enable the
06:20 - Cassandra then we just need to start the
06:24 - Cassandra by just giving
06:26 - pseudo systems CTL start and it's going
06:29 - to start the Cassandra right
06:32 - once that's done you can once again
06:34 - check the status of Cassandra by using
06:37 - sudo system CTL status Cassandra command
06:40 - and if it shows active and running
06:43 - everything is working for you so you can
06:46 - start using your Cassandra cluster
06:51 - on your Ubuntu operating system right so
06:54 - now
06:56 - for configuring Cassandra so now
06:59 - Cassandra is installed the service is
07:02 - running so let me clear the terminal and
07:07 - for the configuration there is a file
07:09 - called Cassandra yaml and you can
07:14 - edit that file using sudo Nano command
07:18 - or you can use the editor of your choice
07:20 - I'm going to use G edit for now then
07:25 - forward slash
07:26 - Etc
07:28 - Cassandra and then Cassandra yaml file
07:32 - dot yaml file then press enter it's
07:35 - going to open this Cassandra yaml file
07:38 - here
07:39 - all the cluster configuration of your
07:42 - Cassandra cluster is given so cluster
07:45 - name is test cluster for now
07:47 - and then number of tokens and other
07:52 - configuration is given here right
07:55 - so you can change
07:59 - these configurations from here for
08:01 - example if you want to change the
08:03 - default Port of Cassandra right you can
08:06 - change that from here
08:08 - so this is the yaml file which you can
08:11 - use to configure Cassandra for you okay
08:15 - okay so uh you can do the configuration
08:19 - in that way now how you can interact
08:22 - with your custom.cluster
08:25 - when you install Cassandra it comes with
08:27 - cqlsh
08:30 - command utility which is Cassandra query
08:34 - shell right so just write cql as H here
08:38 - and then press enter
08:40 - is going to connect to your Cassandra
08:43 - cluster by default uh it has started on
08:48 - 9042 Port on localhost
08:51 - and here
08:53 - you are now in SQL sh shell right the
08:58 - most basic uh command is help you can
09:02 - just write help here and it's going to
09:04 - give you uh
09:06 - all the commands related to Cassandra
09:10 - which you can use so you can see uh
09:12 - create index create aggregate drop uh
09:17 - create role create key space all these
09:20 - commands are present right
09:23 - so cql is similar but not exactly same
09:29 - uh as SQL it looks like a SQL uh query
09:35 - language but it's not exactly SQL right
09:40 - so for example I'm going to just write
09:43 - help
09:45 - show and it's going to give me the
09:47 - description how I can use this show
09:50 - command so for example I can use show
09:53 - version so let me use this show version
09:56 - command and it's going to give me the
09:59 - SQL sh version Cassandra version and SQL
10:03 - spec version right I can also use this
10:07 - show host
10:09 - command and it gives me the default
10:15 - host and Port right if I want to create
10:18 - a key space I can give this command
10:22 - which is create key space and then the
10:25 - name of your key space and then you need
10:27 - to give the replication strategy for now
10:31 - I'm going to use a simple strategy there
10:34 - are various different strategies which
10:37 - you can use and the replication factor
10:39 - is one in my case I just want to test it
10:42 - right I will press enter and then this
10:45 - key space is created now in order to use
10:48 - this key space just write use and then
10:51 - the name of your key space which is test
10:54 - underscore DB in my case press enter and
10:57 - then you are inside this key space right
11:00 - so now you have created the key space
11:02 - let's create a table inside this key
11:05 - space key space is similar to a database
11:08 - now let's create a table so table
11:11 - creation command is similar to SQL
11:15 - command you can just write create table
11:18 - and then your table name let me change
11:22 - this name here because this name is not
11:25 - correct because I wanted to give
11:29 - different name this is the DB name right
11:32 - I will give test table here and then
11:35 - give this command
11:37 - so
11:39 - just copy this and paste this command
11:42 - and then it's going to create our table
11:44 - right
11:45 - then in order to insert the data you can
11:48 - use this insert into the table name and
11:52 - then your
11:55 - column names and then you have the
11:58 - values right so I'm going to just
12:00 - copy this insert command and paste it
12:03 - here and then press enter and it says
12:07 - error for Server unable to make
12:11 - int to this right so let me just make
12:15 - this int value little bit smaller and
12:18 - then once again give this insert command
12:22 - because my phone number was little bit
12:24 - bigger right
12:27 - so once that's done you can just write
12:29 - select as tricks from
12:33 - and then your table name my table name
12:36 - is test table and then press enter and
12:39 - it's going to show me my data right so
12:43 - this is how you can download and install
12:45 - and use Cassandra on your Ubuntu
12:48 - operating system I hope you enjoyed this
12:51 - video and I will see you in the next
12:53 - video

you need to have Java 8 or Java 11 installed so you can see Oracle Java standard 8 Edition should be installed or Oracle standard edition 11 should be installed or you should have higher version than these two versions if you don't know how to install Java I have already created a video on installing Java on Ubuntu operating system I can put the link of that video also in the description so you

to log into my Ubuntu operating system now it says this dab is not found why this is complaining about this because you can see on the Cassandra website uh this command is broken into two lines and this doesn't work right so let's fix that problem so just copy this command once again go to any editor of your choice and then just go to the second line and then press backspace here and then press space right so now we have added this dab in the same line as the whole Command right in this web page this line is on one line and then we have the second line whole command should be on one line right so that's what I have done so I have given space and then added this dab in the same line copy the command once again and I'm going to paste this command once again so I'm going to paste this command and then press enter and hopefully this will work so once that is done I'm going to clear my terminal and then move to the next command which is this command so let me copy this curl command I'm going to copy this and paste it into my terminal and it's going to fetch these Keys here let's move to the next command which is sudo aptget update so I'm going to give this command here and then

can see right now the status of Cassandra service is its active and running if you see any other status like it's disabled or it's stopped or it's not active then let me show you what you can do so instead of checking the status you can enable Cassandra by giving this command which is just enable Cassandra right this go this is going to enable the Cassandra you can see customer service is not a native service redirecting this to this one because Cassandra is already enabled this hasn't done anything in my case but if it's not enabled it will enable the Cassandra then we just need to start the Cassandra by just giving pseudo systems CTL start and it's going to start the Cassandra right once that's done you can once again check the status of Cassandra by using sudo system CTL status

so now Cassandra is installed the service is running so let me clear the terminal and for the configuration there is a file called Cassandra yaml and you can edit that file using sudo Nano command or you can use the editor of your choice I'm going to use G edit for now then forward slash Etc Cassandra and then Cassandra yaml file dot yaml file then press enter it's going to open this Cassandra yaml file here all the cluster configuration of your Cassandra cluster is given so cluster name is test cluster for now and then number of tokens and other configuration is given here right so you can change these configurations from here for example if you want to change the default Port of Cassandra right you can change that from here so this is the yaml file which you can use to configure Cassandra for you okay okay so uh you can do the configuration in that way now how you can interact with your custom.cluster when you install Cassandra it comes with cqlsh command utility which is Cassandra query shell right so just write cql as H here and then press enter is going to connect to your Cassandra cluster by default uh it has started on 9042 Port on localhost and here you are now

index create aggregate drop uh create role create key space all these commands are present right so cql is similar but not exactly same uh as SQL it looks like a SQL uh query language but it's not exactly SQL right so for example I'm going to just write help show and it's going to give me the description how I can use this show command so for example I can use show version so let me use this show version command and it's going to give me the SQL sh version Cassandra version and SQL spec version right I can also use this show host command and it gives me the default host and Port right if I want to create a key space I can give this command which is create key space and then the name of your key space and then you need to give the replication strategy for now I'm going to use a simple strategy there are various different strategies which you can use and the replication factor is one in my case I just want to test it right I will press enter and then this key space is created now in

the key space let's create a table inside this key space key space is similar to a database now let's create a table so table creation command is similar to SQL command you can just write create table and then your table name let me change this name here because this name is not correct because I wanted to give different name this is the DB name right I will give test table here and then give this command so just copy this and paste this command and then it's going to create our table right then in order to insert the data you can use this insert into the table name and then your column names and then you have the values right so I'm going to just copy this insert command and paste it here and then press enter and it says error for Server unable to make int to this right so let me just make this int value little bit smaller and then once again give this insert command because my phone number was little bit bigger right so once that's done you can just write select as tricks from and then your table name my table name is test table and then press enter and it's going to show me my data right so this is how you can download and install and use Cassandra on your Ubuntu operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
