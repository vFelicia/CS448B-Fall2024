00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in our previous video we saw
00:06 - that how to create a database and how to
00:09 - drop a database in MySQL in this video I
00:14 - will show you how to create tables in
00:16 - those databases so let's first of all
00:21 - get the list of the database that we
00:24 - have in - queuing so I just write so
00:30 - databases here you can see we have data
00:38 - test information schema mask ul
00:41 - performance command system so now if we
00:45 - want to switch to the data test database
00:48 - so right use data test so now we are in
01:04 - data test database and we want to create
01:07 - a table in this database so for creating
01:11 - a table just click on this icon which
01:15 - says create a new table in the active
01:18 - schema in connected server so here you
01:24 - can see you can give you the name of the
01:27 - table you want so let me give it student
01:31 - level as all of you know that students
01:44 - want is a table and the table has rows
01:47 - and columns so we can give the name of
01:51 - the column here so let's say the student
01:55 - has a role number
02:01 - here you can specify the data type of
02:05 - the data that you want to store in that
02:07 - column you can say integer where care
02:11 - decimal dead time and blob data type so
02:15 - let's just select integer here you can
02:20 - see there are a couple of fills here
02:22 - PK is stands for primary key consider
02:28 - one case in which you have a table
02:31 - called student and you have only two
02:35 - records in this table and the fields are
02:41 - name and surname and consider a case in
02:45 - which for both of the students the name
02:48 - and surname are the same then you cannot
02:52 - distinguish between those two student so
02:55 - there must be a field which can uniquely
02:58 - identify records in the tables so
03:02 - primary key is a field which is unique
03:05 - for all the records okay
03:08 - so roll number is unique for all this
03:11 - one's so we mark primary key and by
03:15 - default if we mark the primary key then
03:18 - it has to be not null because there has
03:21 - to be a primary key okay let's insert
03:27 - another field called name back and
03:36 - surname okay so now click on apply this
03:48 - is the query that runs on the background
03:50 - let me just copy it for the future and
03:55 - click on apply an SQL script was
04:00 - successfully applied to the database
04:06 - if we want to see we can just refresh it
04:11 - you can see the Sprunt table is created
04:15 - if you want to see why our query then
04:18 - right so tables here you can see one
04:27 - table is created now if we want to drop
04:34 - a table we can write drop table and
04:46 - table name and fire this query or if we
04:51 - want to delete a table from here sorry
04:57 - from here
04:58 - so you can just right-click on it and
05:02 - click on drop table and it will drop the
05:07 - table so tables you can see there are no
05:21 - tables let me just clear it and now we
05:27 - want to create a table using query
05:29 - language so I just paste the query that
05:35 - I copied so for that this is C syntax
05:41 - first of all you need to write create
05:43 - table and then you can specify the
05:47 - database which you are currently in and
05:50 - the name of the data name of the table
05:53 - that you want to give and brackets here
06:00 - you can
06:00 - if I than columns name roll number
06:04 - integer is for data type not null
06:08 - because roll number is a primary key
06:10 - name where can this 45 is the length for
06:17 - the name and it can be null surname
06:22 - worker and it can be nil and in lastly
06:25 - we specify what is the primary key for
06:28 - this particular table so we specify the
06:32 - roll number is this primary key now we
06:35 - can execute it and just refresh it and
06:43 - we can see student has been created and
06:47 - it has three columns roll number name
06:51 - and surname so why these methods you can
06:57 - create as many as tables in the database
07:00 - so how to insert records in these tables
07:05 - we will say that in our next video so
07:08 - thanks for watching it
07:19 - you

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to create a database and how to drop a database in MySQL in this video I will show you how to create tables in those databases so let's first of all get the list of the database that we have in queuing so I just write so databases here you can see we have data test information schema mask ul performance command system so now if we want to switch to the data test database so right use data test so now we are in data test database and we want to create a table in this database so for creating a table just click on this icon which says create a new table in the active schema in connected server so here you can see you can give you the name of the table you want so let me give it student level as all of you know that students want is a table and the table has rows and columns so we can give the name of the column here so let's say the student has a role number here you can specify the data type of the data that you want to store in that column you can say integer where care decimal dead time and blob data type so let's just select integer here you can see there are a couple of fills here PK is stands for primary key consider one case in which you have a table called student and you have only two records in this table and the fields are name and surname and consider a case in which for both of the students the name and surname are the same then you cannot distinguish between those two student so there must be a field which can uniquely identify records in the tables so primary key is a field which is unique for all the records okay so roll number is unique for all this one's so we mark primary key and by default if we mark the primary key then it has to be not null because there has to be a primary key okay let's insert another field called name back and surname okay so now click on apply this is the query that runs on the background let me just copy it for the future and click on apply an SQL script was successfully applied to the database if we want to see we can just refresh it you can see the Sprunt table is created if you want to see why our query then right so tables here you can see one table is created now if we want to drop a table we can write drop table and table name and fire this query or if we want to delete a table from here sorry from here so you can just rightclick on it and click on drop table and it will drop the table so tables you can see there are no tables let me just clear it and now we want to create a table using query language so I just paste the query that I copied so for that this is C syntax first of all you need to write create table and then you can specify the database which you are currently in and the name of the data name of the table that you want to give and brackets here you can if I than columns name roll number integer is for data type not null because roll number is a primary key name where can this 45 is the length for the name and it can be null surname worker and it can be nil and in lastly we specify what is the primary key for this particular table so we specify the roll number is this primary key now we can execute it and just refresh it and we can see student has been created and it has three columns roll number name and surname so why these methods you can create as many as tables in the database so how to insert records in these tables we will say that in our next video so thanks for watching it you
