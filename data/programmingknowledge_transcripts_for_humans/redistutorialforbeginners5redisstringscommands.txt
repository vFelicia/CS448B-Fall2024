00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - reddis tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last few videos we have seen how we can
00:06 - download and install reddis on our
00:08 - Windows Linux and Mac operating system
00:12 - now further videos I will be making on
00:15 - my Linux operating system that is my
00:18 - Ubuntu operating system because more
00:21 - frequently or most frequently This redis
00:24 - Server is installed on a Linux machine
00:28 - and it's used from a Linux machine so
00:31 - it's will be more appropriate to go
00:34 - further with this Linux operating system
00:36 - but all the command which I'm will be
00:39 - using on this Linux operating system
00:41 - using the command line are applicable on
00:43 - the Windows terminal also and the Mac
00:46 - terminal also so the command will not
00:49 - change and you just need to start the
00:51 - reddis server and reddis CLI on your
00:54 - Windows or Mac OS and then follow these
00:58 - uh instruction which I'm giving
01:00 - on my Y 2 operating system so if you are
01:03 - on Windows or Mac you just need to
01:06 - follow the same uh steps you just need
01:08 - to open two terminals on your operating
01:12 - system it can be Mac or uh it can be uh
01:16 - your windows and of course the Linux and
01:20 - on one terminal you just need to start
01:23 - the redis server so I'm going to just
01:27 - start the redis server here and on the
01:30 - other one you just need to start the
01:33 - reddis CLI okay so looks simple right
01:38 - the same step you need to do on your
01:40 - windows or your Mac okay so once our
01:43 - server is running we can uh minimize
01:46 - this and start working to interact with
01:49 - this server using the redish CLI okay
01:54 - now let's start with the data types
01:57 - which are there in redis and and then we
02:00 - will see how we can use one of the data
02:03 - type which is string so basically there
02:06 - are five data types which we can use in
02:09 - redis and as I already told you that
02:11 - redis is a key value storage so the key
02:16 - is a printable ask key right and it can
02:21 - be up to 512 megabyte so it can take a
02:26 - really big uh key for example and it
02:30 - should be a printable ask key and then
02:32 - we can see the data types of values so
02:36 - the values Can Be Strings and then uh
02:40 - the containers of strings so they can be
02:43 - uh hashes or lists or sets or sorted
02:47 - sets right so the key are printable ask
02:51 - Keys we can uh use printable ask keys
02:54 - for keys and for values we can use
02:56 - strings hashes lists sets and sorted
03:01 - sets right and this uh reddish string
03:05 - can be up to
03:07 - 5002 megabyte okay now let's start with
03:12 - the Practical example so we will start
03:16 - with the basics and we will uh try to
03:19 - set some values and get some values so
03:23 - for example I have set some values
03:26 - already to this uh redish uh server so
03:31 - what I will do is to get all the keys
03:34 - which are set you just need to write
03:37 - keys and then the pattern which uh is
03:41 - estx here so estx is a wild card and
03:44 - it's going to uh search all the keys
03:48 - which are saved in your database and
03:51 - then give you the result so for example
03:54 - I have set two keys which is name and
03:58 - name two and and uh it has given me both
04:02 - the keys which I have saved right so in
04:05 - order to see all the keys which are
04:07 - saved in your redis database you just
04:11 - need to write keys and estrick right now
04:16 - as I already uh told you that to set
04:19 - some uh value as a string you just need
04:22 - to use set and then a key for example in
04:26 - this case I'm going to write name three
04:30 - because name and name one is already set
04:33 - so I'm going to just set the third key
04:36 - which is name three and then I'm going
04:39 - to give some name right and then press
04:42 - enter and then once again I will just
04:45 - write Keys Asis and now I can see there
04:49 - are three keys stored in my database
04:53 - right so set is to set a string value
04:58 - and as you have already guessed from my
05:01 - previous videos I've shown you this
05:03 - command which is get command and
05:06 - whatever key uh you will write here
05:08 - it'll give you the value of that key
05:11 - which is Mark in this case right in the
05:15 - same way you can do name uh two get name
05:18 - two and it's going to give you the value
05:20 - of name two okay so get and set we are
05:23 - already clear now there is a delete
05:26 - command Dell okay so you using a dell
05:31 - and the key name we can delete some key
05:34 - value pair so for example I want to
05:36 - delete name two for now and then I will
05:40 - just press enter it's going to give me
05:44 - the number of uh Keys affected and in
05:48 - this case there is only one key with the
05:51 - name to and now when I just do this
05:55 - command which is Keys srix now it just
05:59 - gives me two values which is name and
06:03 - name three and because name two key is
06:06 - already deleted so I will not see this
06:10 - uh name to again right in the same way
06:13 - for example I want to delete uh name
06:16 - three key then also I can do dell and
06:21 - then name three and then press enter and
06:25 - I can see the result one key affected
06:28 - and then
06:30 - now only one key left which is name okay
06:34 - so uh this is how you can delete some
06:37 - value right now let's set uh these names
06:40 - once again so for example name Tom and
06:43 - once again do the get for example get
06:45 - name now you will uh see that the key
06:50 - value of name is overwritten with the
06:55 - name Tom so previously the value of name
06:59 - was Mark you can see here and now it's
07:03 - Tom so whenever you set uh the value of
07:09 - previously uh set key then whatever
07:12 - value you will give for this key will be
07:16 - overwritten right so value will be
07:18 - overwritten for that key now for example
07:21 - if you want to delete all the values
07:23 - which are stored in our redest database
07:25 - then we can use flush all command so for
07:28 - example I will set some more values uh
07:32 - to see this example for example name two
07:35 - is equal to John and then I'm going to
07:39 - give name 3 is equal to Max so now we
07:43 - have three names so we can uh just give
07:46 - keys and asteris to see that so we have
07:50 - three keys stored right now for example
07:53 - I want to delete all these Keys then I
07:56 - can give flush all so just write flush
08:00 - all command and then it's going to
08:03 - delete all the values so it says okay
08:05 - and then once again when we give keys
08:08 - estx then you can see empty list or set
08:13 - so all the values are deleted using
08:15 - flush all commands so these are some of
08:19 - the most frequently used uh commands
08:22 - which we can use with the strings in the
08:25 - next video also we will see some of the
08:28 - more commands which we can use with the
08:31 - string values so stay tuned and please
08:34 - write comment and subscribe and bye for
08:36 - now

hey guys welcome to the next video on reddis tutorial for beginners in the last few videos we have seen how we can download and install reddis on our Windows Linux and Mac operating system now further videos I will be making on my Linux operating system that is my Ubuntu operating system because more frequently or most frequently This redis Server is installed on a Linux machine and it's used from a Linux machine so it's will be more appropriate to go further with this Linux operating system but all the command which I'm will be using on this Linux operating system using the command line are applicable on the Windows terminal also and the Mac terminal also so the command will not change and you just need to start the reddis server and reddis CLI on your Windows or Mac OS and then follow these uh instruction which I'm giving on my Y 2 operating system so if you are on Windows or Mac you just need to follow the same uh steps you just need to open two terminals on your operating system it can be Mac or uh it can be uh your windows and of course the Linux and on one terminal you just need to start the redis server so I'm going to just start the redis server here and on the other one you just need to start the reddis CLI okay so looks simple right the same step you need to do on your windows or your Mac okay so once our server is running we can uh minimize this and start working to interact with this server using the redish CLI okay now let's start with the data types which are there in redis and and then we will see how we can use one of the data type which is string so basically there are five data types which we can use in redis and as I already told you that redis is a key value storage so the key is a printable ask key right and it can be up to 512 megabyte so it can take a really big uh key for example and it should be a printable ask key and then we can see the data types of values so the values Can Be Strings and then uh the containers of strings so they can be uh hashes or lists or sets or sorted sets right so the key are printable ask Keys we can uh use printable ask keys for keys and for values we can use strings hashes lists sets and sorted sets right and this uh reddish string can be up to 5002 megabyte okay now let's start with the Practical example so we will start with the basics and we will uh try to set some values and get some values so for example I have set some values already to this uh redish uh server so what I will do is to get all the keys which are set you just need to write keys and then the pattern which uh is estx here

set uh these names once again so for example name Tom and once again do the get for example get name now you will uh see that the key value of name is overwritten with the name Tom so previously the value of name was Mark you can see here and now it's Tom so whenever you set uh the value of previously uh set key then whatever value you will give for this key will be overwritten right so value will be overwritten for that key now for example if you want to delete all the values which are stored in our redest database then we can use flush all command so for example I will set some more
