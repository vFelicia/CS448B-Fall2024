00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:04 - in this video we will learn how to use
00:08 - CSS or cascading style sheets in HTML
00:13 - now CSS is whole different topic and it
00:17 - requires you know many videos to learn
00:21 - CSS but I'm going to give you a brief
00:24 - introduction how you can use CSS in HTML
00:27 - so there are three ways in which you can
00:32 - use CSS in HTML one is internal second
00:38 - is inline and third is external so first
00:43 - of all let's see how we can use inline
00:46 - CSS with our HTML element so for example
00:51 - I have this h1 tag and I have some text
00:55 - inside this h1 tag and I want to change
00:58 - the appearance of this text so right now
01:02 - it looks like this right so for example
01:06 - I want to change the color of this text
01:09 - so what I can do is I can add a style
01:13 - attribute here and as a style I can add
01:17 - a color and color can be for example red
01:23 - okay I will save it and I will refresh
01:26 - my webpage and now it looks like red
01:30 - right you can change it to some other
01:33 - color and save your code and refresh
01:37 - your page add changes to that color so
01:40 - this is how you can add inline styling
01:44 - to your element now let's see how to add
01:48 - internal styling to our HTML tags so go
01:54 - inside your head element and inside the
01:58 - header element you just need to add
02:00 - style element here and in here in the
02:05 - inside style element right now we don't
02:08 - need this text attribute so just inside
02:11 - your style element what you can do is
02:13 - you can choose the name of your elements
02:17 - for example I want to change the font
02:20 - size of this h1 element right so I will
02:24 - just write h1 and then inside the
02:30 - brackets these curly brackets I can
02:33 - provide the attribute for example I want
02:36 - to change the font size
02:38 - I can choose font size and then I can
02:41 - choose my size for example 100 px which
02:46 - stands for 100 pixels
02:48 - okay I save it and I will refresh my
02:52 - page and now the font size is changed
02:55 - 200px right now for example I want to
02:59 - transfer this property to this internal
03:03 - style so how what I can do is I can just
03:07 - choose this color colon and then just
03:11 - below this I can add this property and
03:13 - at the last I and need to add this
03:15 - semicolon here and now I can remove this
03:18 - style from here and save it and it will
03:22 - be same style right so we can use these
03:26 - Styles like this now for example I want
03:29 - to change the background of my body so I
03:31 - can take the body element from here
03:34 - something like body and inside these
03:40 - curly braces I can change the background
03:43 - color for example background color and I
03:48 - can choose any color here for example
03:51 - yellow okay and save it and refresh your
03:57 - page and the background becomes yellow
04:00 - here okay now let's see how we can add
04:04 - our external CSS file in our HTML so
04:10 - first of all we need to create a CSS
04:13 - file so I will go to my web content
04:15 - folder and I will create a new and I
04:19 - will choose a new file here and this
04:22 - time I want to create a style dot CSS
04:24 - file so just write style
04:27 - dot CSS and CSS stands for cascading
04:32 - style sheet as I already told you and
04:35 - just save this CSS file here and in here
04:39 - you can just transfer your style which
04:44 - you have provided here like this just
04:46 - copy this and I will delete this style
04:49 - element from here and inside your CSS
04:53 - file you just need to give these styles
04:56 - like this so for h1 tag same as you have
05:00 - given as an internal style you can give
05:03 - it here
05:04 - right now to add the CSS file in our
05:07 - HTML file what we need to do is we need
05:10 - to add a link tag here so add a link tag
05:14 - and as an attribute here we add a
05:17 - attribute called arielle and whose value
05:21 - should be equal to style sheet right and
05:24 - the second attribute we want to give
05:26 - here is H ref as we give in our link and
05:31 - then is equal to give the path of your
05:35 - CSS file so it's in the same directory
05:39 - as in my HTML file so I can directly
05:42 - write style dot CSS okay now this will
05:47 - add the CSS file in your HTML file and
05:51 - then once you refresh your page it will
05:55 - look like the same okay and when you
05:58 - remove some property for example this
06:01 - background color and save it and refresh
06:04 - your page will remove your property
06:07 - right so these are the three ways you
06:10 - can add a CSS file in your HTML file now
06:15 - there are two more important things in
06:18 - CSS you need to know one is called a ID
06:22 - attribute and another is called a class
06:26 - attribute okay so I'm going to remove
06:29 - all the styling code from my styling
06:33 - sheet and once again I will go to my
06:36 - HTML file and for example first of all
06:40 - we will learn
06:41 - to use ID attribute with CSS okay so for
06:45 - example I add our attribute called
06:48 - ID here and I can define my own ID for
06:51 - example my ID and then I can go to my
06:55 - style dot CSS file here and then here
06:59 - first of all I will give the name of the
07:01 - element in which I want to add this
07:04 - style so h1 is the name of the element
07:07 - so just write h1 and then write a hash
07:12 - and then write the name of the ID so ID
07:17 - name is my ID right so write the name of
07:20 - the ID and then add these curly braces
07:23 - here and then you can provide your
07:26 - property which you want to change for
07:29 - example color and I want to change it to
07:32 - red color right like this and save your
07:37 - code and refresh your page it becomes
07:41 - red okay so this is how you can use ID
07:46 - attribute with CSS now there is one more
07:50 - attribute called class so for example I
07:52 - delete this attribute ID from my h1 tag
07:56 - and I add a attribute called class here
07:59 - and I can define my own class so for
08:02 - example my class and once again I will
08:07 - go to my style the CSS file and instead
08:10 - of using this what I can do is I can
08:14 - write something like this so first of
08:16 - all I can take the name of my element
08:19 - which I want to use so for example h1
08:22 - because this class is in the h1 tag
08:25 - right and then dot my class name which
08:30 - is my class right and then these curly
08:34 - braces and inside the curly braces once
08:37 - again the for example color attribute I
08:41 - want to change and this time I want to
08:43 - change it to blue right so I will save
08:46 - my code and refresh my webpage and it
08:49 - becomes blue so in this way you can use
08:52 - class attribute
08:55 - in CSS and HTML okay so that's it for
08:58 - CSS I hope you understood the basic
09:02 - concept how to use CSS in HTML so that's
09:05 - it for this video please rate comment

hello guys welcome to the next video on HTML tutorial for beginners using html5 in this video we will learn how to use CSS or cascading style sheets in HTML now CSS is whole different topic and it requires you know many videos to learn CSS but I'm going to give you a brief introduction how you can use CSS in HTML so there are three ways in which you can use CSS in HTML one is internal second is inline and third is external so first of all let's see how we can use inline CSS with our HTML element so for example I have this h1 tag and I have some text inside this h1 tag and I want to change

add changes to that color so this is how you can add inline styling to your element now let's see how to add internal styling to our HTML tags so go inside your head element and inside the header element you just need to add style element here and in here in the inside style element right now we don't need this text attribute so just inside your style element what you can do is you can choose the name of your elements for example I want to change the font size of this h1 element right so I will just write h1 and then inside the brackets these curly brackets I can provide the attribute for example I want to change the font size I can choose font size and then I can choose my size for example 100 px which stands for 100 pixels okay I save it and I will refresh my page and now the font size is changed 200px right now for example I want to transfer this property to this internal style so how what I can do is I can just choose this color colon and then just below this I can add this property and at the last I and need to add this semicolon here and now I can remove this style from here and save it and it will be same style right so we can use these Styles like this now for example I want to change the background of my body so I can take the body element from here something like body and inside these curly braces I can change the background color for example background color and I can choose any color here for example yellow okay and save it and refresh your page and the background becomes yellow here okay now let's see how we can add our external CSS file in our

you remove some property for example this background color and save it and refresh your page will remove your property right so these are the three ways you can add a CSS file in your HTML file now there are two more important things in CSS you need to know one is called a ID attribute and another is called a class attribute okay so I'm going to remove all the styling code from my styling sheet and once again I will go to my HTML file and for example first of all we will learn to use ID attribute with CSS okay so for example I add our attribute called ID here and I can define my own ID for example my ID and then I can go to my style dot CSS file here and then here first of all I will give the name of the element in which I want to add this style so h1 is the name of the element so just

once again I will go to my style the CSS file and instead of using this what I can do is I can write something like this so first of all I can take the name of my element which I want to use so for example h1 because this class is in the h1 tag right and then dot my class name which is my class right and then these curly braces and inside the curly braces once again the for example color attribute I want to change and this time I want to change it to blue right so I will save my code and refresh my webpage and it becomes blue so in this way you can use class attribute in CSS and HTML okay so that's it for CSS I hope you understood the basic concept how to use CSS in HTML so that's it for this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
