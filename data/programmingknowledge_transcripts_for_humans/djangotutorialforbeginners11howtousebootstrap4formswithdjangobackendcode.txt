00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so this
00:02 - is the 11 tutorial of a jungle series so
00:04 - I again welcome you all to programming
00:06 - knowledge so like in the previous
00:08 - tutorial I showed you how you can create
00:09 - a form layout on your front-end part
00:12 - using bootstrap now I am today going to
00:15 - work with the back end part so today I
00:17 - am going to show you how you can
00:19 - integrate your form with the backend
00:21 - part so today we are going to basically
00:23 - work with the forms using two method one
00:25 - is a request method and another is a
00:27 - post method so this is the bucket link
00:30 - of a repository you can clone or
00:32 - download this project I have defined
00:34 - below the instructions how we can run it
00:36 - on your local machine so it's been so
00:40 - you can test the project on a local
00:42 - machine and try out the things so I'll
00:46 - move to my server here so I had defined
00:48 - a form using my form so this is a form
00:53 - we had made in the previous lecture so
00:55 - today what I am going to do what I'm
00:59 - going to do so this is the I create a
01:01 - button in this form first
01:03 - so Highline Dave class is equal to form
01:08 - group here you can see I have defined a
01:10 - form group for each input element so
01:12 - form crew okay now I'll define a button
01:19 - so this button should be type is equal
01:21 - to submit because I am going to submit
01:24 - this form and and what I will define a
01:28 - class is equal to button button primary
01:31 - and this would give me the default color
01:35 - of the button and I type this submit as
01:41 - the button value to shown on the fronted
01:45 - part so I will go to move to this page
01:47 - and so this is my button I right click
01:50 - here quickly to inspect what changes I
01:53 - can do to make this more responsive and
01:55 - better so I'll do margin:0 auto so this
02:00 - is a margin:0 auto used is done to
02:03 - center the element so this doesn't work
02:05 - by trying this way block young this
02:07 - works so I'll copy the CSS quickly and
02:11 - I'll create a sty
02:13 - limit here style and I quickly copy this
02:18 - and paste it here and this looks pretty
02:20 - fine so i refresh this page
02:23 - yeah now the button okay yeah now the
02:27 - button is in the center and now till now
02:32 - I've only defined the form and two
02:34 - things I'm missing in this form is one
02:36 - is the better method and another is the
02:39 - action so how you can work with these
02:43 - two things so we are going to cover in
02:46 - this tutorial first I go to my view
02:48 - store py file and then the your short py
02:50 - so I define a path here part submit my
02:59 - form and I what I'm going to do submit
03:05 - my form is going to be your where I am
03:07 - going to submit the form and you start
03:11 - submit my form and name is equal to
03:14 - submit my form okay
03:16 - now this looks pretty fine so I have not
03:20 - defined a first I'll define of who
03:22 - submit my form in method in my view file
03:26 - so I'll go to pick me quickly go go here
03:28 - to death submit request ID ProQuest as a
03:37 - parameter and for sides there do return
03:40 - HTTP response or let me do one thing for
03:44 - okay
03:47 - okay and define my dictionary here and
03:53 - where one I'll define a bad one right to
03:59 - y3 what I'll do request dot method this
04:11 - would be the value of my y3 okay and
04:14 - okay I'll do one thing I'll keep this as
04:19 - method and this will be request what
04:24 - method okay so and
04:27 - find a JSON response of my dictionary
04:32 - I quickly cover all this thing so what
04:34 - I'm going to do this was my form so I'll
04:38 - define first
04:39 - action I'll define a method here and
04:42 - that method first we will work with the
04:44 - get method and then the post method okay
04:47 - guys so this is the get method here and
04:50 - get method and post method have a
04:52 - difference so we'll get this in our
04:56 - tutorial what's the difference between
04:57 - the two forces the gate and I define an
05:00 - action so what I'm going to do I'm going
05:04 - to use the shorthand property to how to
05:06 - specify a URL I will find person you are
05:10 - okay person you are and then a % so you
05:16 - can be a little bit familiar with this
05:18 - so I have to find a shorthand notation
05:20 - post curly brace this post on URL then
05:23 - hi and define a name between this single
05:26 - quotes this is person sign Nani curly
05:28 - braces okay I need to define the name
05:32 - where I have to submit and pass this
05:36 - form and the name should be this name is
05:41 - equal to submit my form and I need to
05:44 - submit my form to this route which has
05:47 - having the name submit my form okay so
05:50 - I'll go here so now I think this is
05:55 - pretty fine
05:56 - so I have defined a URL to submit my
05:58 - form and this form will be submitted to
06:01 - that okay that route now I have method
06:05 - defined the method escape and action is
06:06 - this okay now what I'm having a I'm
06:10 - having fun error and that is don't
06:14 - define the value of my keys in my
06:16 - dictionary so what you can do okay first
06:22 - what I'll do I comment this out and
06:24 - comment this out okay so first I'll tell
06:28 - you show you one thing okay line I'm
06:32 - having an error you will short py line
06:35 - two
06:39 - [Music]
06:42 - okay I'm handsome ever let me check okay
06:50 - no no no okay now it's rude if I'm sorry
06:51 - sorry
06:52 - so no it's fine fine okay so my form is
06:56 - will be ready to be in submit so what
06:58 - I'm going to do first I've only made a
07:00 - request or method so what I'm going to
07:03 - do I'll make a test test okay I'll make
07:12 - a different value test debug now I
07:15 - submit my form now what you can see here
07:19 - okay let me I'm having some issue in my
07:26 - phone okay dad submit my yard has been
07:30 - defined and method has been yet okay i
07:46 - defined a URL okay
07:50 - submit my phone I'll do first page test
08:01 - yeah now this is predefined okay so now
08:05 - this is fine totally fine okay I had
08:08 - some issues I restarted my server now
08:10 - it's pretty fine okay so what I'm going
08:13 - to tell you that I'll quickly cover up
08:15 - the things I defined a URL submit my
08:17 - form then this is my url and now I have
08:22 - defined the action to this URL some
08:24 - reference ear and method was scared so I
08:28 - so now if I went to this URL abuse or
08:31 - submit my homework score so when I went
08:33 - here what I saw I returned a dictionary
08:36 - a JSON response only mentioning the
08:39 - method so this method was basically
08:42 - kicked method so what I got here
08:44 - the method is get okay so how you can
08:46 - derive the values so this is the where
08:50 - one
08:51 - and why - so whatever okay so the main
08:55 - important thing what I'm gonna do so
08:56 - what you can see in the get method you
09:00 - can see the name of the response okay
09:03 - sorry the parameters parameters which
09:05 - are being partial so I had my text which
09:08 - I had put the data's test and I had my
09:11 - text area which I put it here data is
09:14 - debug okay so here you can see the name
09:17 - of the variables so these variables I
09:19 - mix a printed by a question mark
09:21 - and the route is being submitted my form
09:23 - okay so what I'm going to do how you can
09:28 - use this value to request dot get and
09:32 - the first is my text okay and this is
09:37 - the variable am being referred and
09:40 - another is my text area
09:44 - okay now I'll do one thing so so I'm
09:51 - missing a comma sign so that's why it's
09:52 - showing me an error now this is pretty
09:54 - fine okay request okay I'm also missing
09:58 - a comma sign here like you're not fine
10:00 - okay now I'll move to my form my home
10:10 - and I type new data new
10:15 - tiba now here you can see where one is
10:21 - not defined where one is not defined
10:29 - okay why is it trying whenever okay okay
10:32 - okay okay so this this is yeah okay I
10:44 - left my new data new dooba and I'll
10:46 - submit this form yeah now this is pretty
10:48 - fine okay so I apologize for all the
10:52 - errors okay now this is pretty fine so
10:54 - here you can see I move to this route
10:57 - submit my form and the parameters being
10:59 - my text which has this data new data you
11:02 - can see
11:04 - okay this this not this school and then
11:08 - I had another parameter my text area
11:11 - here you can see with the values new
11:13 - debug now here you can see this is nudie
11:15 - bar okay and the method is get okay so
11:19 - so this is the difference here you can
11:21 - see the parameters on the upper hand so
11:24 - so here you can see on the her out the
11:26 - parameters are being visible to you so
11:27 - this is the first property of the get
11:29 - method so now the another thing we are
11:31 - going to do we are going to change this
11:33 - method to post okay so this is post okay
11:38 - now what I'm going to do a request dot
11:41 - post so this would be post request dot
11:50 - post okay so this is a another change I
11:54 - am going to do now the difference of
11:56 - including the tube first the method gets
11:58 - changed and now the variables on this
12:00 - road won't be visible or the post method
12:03 - okay so I go my fault okay I tie some
12:12 - Python here Python Django framework now
12:20 - if I submit this form okay now it says
12:26 - CRF verification fail because when you
12:30 - submit a form with the post method you
12:33 - need to define a CRF token so I'd
12:37 - quickly type % c ra on the scope token
12:46 - and this looks now this is fine okay
12:51 - so I'll make a submission here okay I
12:57 - mean using an error okay
13:00 - person CRF token okay I made a mistake
13:03 - sorry I made a mistake with the two
13:06 - curly braces sorry I'm already sorry for
13:07 - this so now this works pretty fine so
13:10 - I'll go go back to my form
13:12 - this is python python Django framework
13:15 - not this is still a minute
13:29 - okay and refresh this by turn-by-turn
13:36 - Django and now I submit this okay now
13:42 - this is fine sorry so here you can see
13:47 - now the variables are being not there on
13:50 - the route so the variable parameters are
13:53 - not there so that's being hidden in the
13:55 - post method plus you have a CRF token
13:58 - here okay so I had some issues I decided
14:03 - my server this is where one with the
14:04 - Python right - with the Python Django so
14:07 - these are some what because then has
14:11 - hidden characters so we'll tell you how
14:13 - you can clean this data and this method
14:16 - is post so basically we work with the
14:18 - get method and the post method in this
14:20 - tutorial and next and in the next
14:23 - upcoming tutorials we are going to work
14:25 - with the database so thank you guys
14:26 - thank you so much
