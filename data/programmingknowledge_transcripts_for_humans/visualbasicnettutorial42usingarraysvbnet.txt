00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use arrays with your
00:05 - Visual Basic Windows Form application
00:07 - this will be a very basic demonstration
00:10 - of using arrays so let's get started I
00:14 - will just take a button and resize it
00:17 - and I will change its text as
00:22 - array and this double click it and first
00:25 - of all I will show you how to declare
00:29 - arrays so for example I want to make the
00:33 - array of
00:35 - names so basically I want to uh have a
00:39 - list of names I have several numberers
00:42 - of names and I want to make a list of
00:45 - those names so I can um store the the
00:49 - names in an array so first of all how to
00:53 - declare array just write dim name and
00:58 - this bracket shows uh Visual Basic that
01:03 - it's an array and whatever number you
01:06 - enter between these bracket will tell
01:10 - Visual Basic that this uh array contains
01:15 - the number plus one members so if you
01:21 - enter here four then it will contain
01:25 - five names because array starts from
01:28 - zero right and and then as usual need to
01:33 - give the data type
01:35 - so for example we give
01:39 - string data type to our name
01:44 - array so this is the Declaration for the
01:48 - array now for the assignment what you
01:51 - can do
01:52 - is this should be names right because
01:56 - this is a list of names so for assign M
02:00 - you can just
02:02 - write
02:05 - names
02:08 - zero is equal
02:11 - to and you can give any
02:13 - [Music]
02:16 - name and in the same way I can
02:19 - assign the rest of the four names right
02:24 - so the array starts from zero then goes
02:28 - to one 2 2 3 and four right and name can
02:35 - be different I'm storing different
02:53 - names okay now how to retrieve these
02:58 - names uh
03:00 - as a useful entity for example I want to
03:05 - show the first element of the array
03:08 - which is Mark
03:11 - then I can just show it in the message
03:14 - box so I will write message box dot
03:21 - show names and in the bracket you can
03:25 - pass the item
03:28 - number and you can just show the name
03:33 - Mark which is the item zero so I will
03:37 - just run my
03:44 - program so my program is running and
03:48 - when I click this button it shows the
03:50 - first element of the array now for
03:53 - example I want to iterate or I want to
03:56 - show all the names one by one this I can
04:00 - do by using for Loop so I will write
04:06 - for I is equal to
04:13 - 0 to the length of the array so we can
04:18 - determine the length of the array by
04:21 - just copying the name of the array
04:28 - dot left
04:31 - right and then I write
04:35 - minus1 y I'm writing here minus one
04:39 - because we
04:41 - are starting from zero right and the
04:45 - length of the array is five so that's
04:49 - why I'm
04:50 - writing minus one here and in here I can
04:55 - just cut this message box from here and
04:58 - paste it here and instead of zero I will
05:02 - write I so it will
05:05 - iterate the value of all the name from 0
05:08 - to four in this message box one by one
05:12 - using this fall Loop so when I run the
05:16 - program and when I click this button it
05:18 - will show the first name which is Mark
05:21 - second name Julie third name fourth name
05:26 - and fifth name right so in this way you
05:30 - can use arrays in your Visual Basic
05:33 - Windows Form application I hope you have
05:36 - enjoyed this video please write comment
05:37 - and subscribe and bye for now
