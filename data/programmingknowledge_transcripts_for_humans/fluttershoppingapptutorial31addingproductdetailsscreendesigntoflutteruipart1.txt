With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this video we are going to
00:02 - continue with our mobile app for the
00:05 - project better buys
00:06 - okay so up until the previous video we
00:09 - have made the splash screen
00:11 - and we also have the sellers screen okay
00:14 - and if we click on any of the seller we
00:17 - go to the products that they offer
00:20 - the products screen basically
00:23 - okay so now over here we have the
00:27 - products okay the list of products
00:30 - this image is not loading i don't know
00:32 - why i think
00:34 - i think the image is no more on my
00:36 - server i'll put it but
00:38 - okay so we have the products now let's
00:41 - make a screen where we show the details
00:44 - or if if you
00:45 - if you remember from our design uh just
00:48 - give me a minute let's let me bring the
00:50 - design yeah so if you remember from the
00:54 - design we have this
00:56 - product screen and then we have the
00:57 - product details screen
01:00 - okay so here we intend to show the
01:02 - details of this product okay if you
01:04 - remember the prototype was
01:08 - okay
01:10 - so i don't think the prototype is here
01:12 - but i'll tell you what the general idea
01:14 - was so if we click on any of the product
01:16 - we nee we will come to this product
01:18 - details
01:20 - page and over here we can see the
01:21 - details of the product we can add it to
01:24 - cart and we can buy now so yes the most
01:27 - popular and what's the word around is
01:29 - still remaining and we'll get back to it
01:32 - once we have sufficient data
01:34 - like for most popular we need to know
01:36 - what who which product has the most
01:39 - interaction count and until then we
01:42 - can't make this and then
01:44 - subsequently this as well okay so this
01:47 - is the
01:49 - product details screen and we are gonna
01:51 - make the ui for it now
01:53 - okay and along with this when we click
01:56 - over here the interaction count should
01:58 - also be increased
01:59 - okay so let's get started
02:03 - so first i'll create a new screen
02:06 - okay a new file in the screens folder it
02:09 - will be called product
02:11 - details
02:13 - screen
02:15 - i'm sorry
02:18 - product
02:19 - details
02:20 - screen dot dot
02:24 - okay now over here we'll
02:26 - now over here we'll create a stateless
02:28 - widget
02:29 - okay so the idea is that we always
02:31 - create a stateless widget and convert it
02:33 - to stateful widget whenever needed so
02:36 - the class name is also gonna be the same
02:38 - product screen details
02:41 - okay
02:42 - now all these are warning because we
02:44 - have a missing import statement so
02:47 - import
02:48 - material
02:51 - okay and the warning is gone now over
02:53 - here inside this container i'll simply
02:56 - create a child and a text that says
02:59 - product
03:05 - product
03:07 - details screen so as so as to check if
03:11 - the navigation is working properly or
03:13 - not okay so this is not that is all
03:16 - gonna be there but this is just for
03:18 - checking okay so i'll save this now
03:21 - another thing that i miss over here is
03:23 - creating the route name so i'm gonna
03:25 - write static const
03:28 - route name
03:30 - and it is gonna be
03:32 - product
03:34 - details
03:35 - screen
03:36 - okay
03:37 - so now that we have that let's add this
03:40 - route in our
03:43 - app widget okay and inside the routes
03:47 - section so for that first we need to
03:48 - import it
03:50 - so i'm simply gonna write import
03:52 - screens
03:55 - and product details screen dot dot okay
03:59 - and similarly over here i'm gonna add
04:02 - product
04:03 - details
04:06 - i'm sorry
04:09 - product
04:10 - details
04:14 - screen
04:15 - dot
04:17 - okay why is it not changing the color
04:19 - did i not save this
04:21 - okay so you can see the spelling is
04:23 - wrong over here actually so
04:26 - it needs to be you
04:28 - okay just please forgive me for this
04:32 - so yes okay
04:34 - let me save this
04:36 - and now we have product details screen
04:41 - router name
04:53 - okay is the name
04:55 - product screen details
04:58 - okay
04:59 - i i am sorry
05:01 - so
05:04 - product screen actually it should be
05:06 - product details screen so the naming
05:09 - convention here only is not right
05:12 - so let me just
05:13 - change it product details
05:16 - screen
05:20 - product
05:23 - details screen let me save this
05:26 - and now over here i think it should be
05:29 - fine product details screen dot route
05:31 - name
05:32 - and then over here we get a con context
05:35 - but since we not don't need it i have
05:37 - put an underscore over here
05:39 - and then over here it is product details
05:42 - screen
05:44 - okay so
05:45 - the part n means
05:47 - main dot app is done let's format it
05:50 - save it
05:51 - now
05:52 - we need to navigate from this section so
05:56 - this is actually a product item
06:00 - this is the widget that we created over
06:02 - here okay so
06:04 - this is the container i guess this is
06:07 - the column that has all the data means
06:09 - like the image the background and the
06:12 - title
06:13 - okay let's confirm so this is the image
06:15 - section and this is the product name so
06:18 - yes so column is our
06:20 - parent widget so what i'm gonna do is
06:23 - i'm gonna refractor it and add a
06:27 - container a widget on top of it and the
06:29 - widget is gonna be nothing but our
06:31 - gesture detector
06:33 - okay
06:34 - and then if
06:35 - on tap
06:37 - so on tap what i'm gonna do is
06:41 - simply write
06:43 - navigator
06:46 - dot off
06:48 - context
06:50 - dot push named
06:54 - and the name is gonna be product detail
06:57 - screens route name so let me import that
06:59 - over here
07:01 - import
07:04 - then in screens we have product details
07:06 - screen so over here it is gonna be
07:09 - product details screen route name
07:14 - comma and i also want to send the
07:16 - product as the argument okay
07:19 - so and the argument is nothing but
07:22 - product
07:24 - great so let me format this
07:29 - it is almost formatted okay i need to
07:32 - give a semicolon over here
07:34 - now let me format it it is done let's
07:36 - save it
07:39 - okay now i'll do a full restart
07:48 - okay i click on the seller albert
07:51 - einstein
07:52 - and then if i click on cucumber we have
07:55 - product details screen so it is giving
07:57 - warning because we don't have like a
07:59 - proper scaffold over here but the
08:02 - navigation is working that is confirmed
08:05 - okay so
08:07 - let's add a scaffold over here since it
08:09 - is a new screen okay now
08:14 - does the scaffold have a child or a body
08:17 - yes so it has a
08:19 - body
08:21 - and the body is gonna be a container
08:26 - okay
08:28 - now let's give a background color to
08:30 - this container to see the
08:33 - size that it is taking
08:37 - okay i don't think we can give it i we
08:39 - can give it a color
08:41 - so let's take any random color for
08:43 - testing
08:45 - control option f to format and then save
08:48 - it and yes it is taking the
08:50 - entire screen so that is actually what
08:53 - we wanted now if i add an app bar
08:57 - okay
08:59 - app bar
09:03 - and then i add a title to it
09:06 - and the title takes a text or a text
09:10 - widget so it takes a widget so over here
09:12 - it is going to be a text widget
09:14 - and let's say
09:16 - title
09:17 - okay let's just see what happens
09:22 - okay so we have a title over here now in
09:25 - the design you can see the title is
09:27 - nothing but the product name
09:30 - and we have a back arrow over here so
09:33 - let's make that
09:35 - so for that first we need the product
09:37 - name over here in the product detail
09:39 - screen
09:40 - so we will
09:42 - import the
09:43 - product that we are sending via this
09:46 - navigator
09:47 - okay so over here first i'll import the
09:49 - model product
09:51 - import
09:53 - come out of screens folder go inside
09:55 - models folder and import
09:57 - product so this is a general convention
10:00 - the app level the
10:02 - global level imports go at the top and
10:04 - app level go below it
10:06 - and if dot level imports are there then
10:09 - it goes above this okay so
10:12 - that is that now we have our product
10:15 - over here
10:17 - product product is equal to model
10:22 - model route
10:25 - of
10:28 - context
10:30 - okay then we have settings
10:33 - and then we have arguments
10:36 - and then as to type cast it
10:38 - as product
10:41 - okay
10:43 - so i think
10:45 - it is not settings
10:48 - i don't know why it is giving an error
10:50 - let's see how we did it earlier so in
10:52 - the product screen we took the seller so
10:55 - we just need to give a semi uh question
10:58 - mark exclamation mark over there
11:00 - okay so
11:02 - in development it is not necessary that
11:04 - you know everything it is how you learn
