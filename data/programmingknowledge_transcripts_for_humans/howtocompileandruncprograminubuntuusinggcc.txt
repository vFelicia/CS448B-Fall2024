00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:03 - video I will show you how to install and
00:08 - compile
00:10 - c
00:12 - c program from
00:15 - your
00:16 - GCC
00:19 - compiler first step if you have
00:22 - installed open 2
00:25 - freshly or new version of open2 and you
00:29 - have fresh with open to you need to
00:38 - install build
00:40 - essential in your open system this build
00:44 - essential will install GCC and g++
00:48 - compiler into your system so from them
00:54 - you can compile your C and
00:57 - C++
00:58 - programs
01:02 - so WR P sudo app- getet installed build
01:08 - essential and press
01:14 - enter and ask me the permission yes
01:28 - working
01:38 - and it will be
01:45 - completed by the meantime the process is
01:48 - completing go to your
01:51 - folder and we will
01:54 - test a simple
01:57 - C program
02:00 - so create a new document in your home
02:04 - directory or wherever you
02:06 - want empty
02:11 - document and name it
02:14 - as
02:17 - test dot
02:23 - C so and open
02:28 - it
02:31 - by double
02:39 - clicking so go to your test do
02:45 - C file and make a simple hello world
02:51 - program include std. include STD
02:58 - li. in Main and print hello
03:02 - world and save this program
03:06 - here and then go to your browser by the
03:10 - meantime I think your build essential
03:13 - have have
03:17 - been installed so now
03:22 - on the
03:24 - terminal because this test. CPP file is
03:29 - on on my
03:32 - home
03:34 - folder so I don't need to go to the file
03:39 - but if it's located anywhere else just
03:44 - see the location and CD to the
03:48 - location and just right
03:54 - here
03:56 - GCC
03:58 - sorry
04:01 - just write
04:03 - GCC test.c which is your
04:07 - program and dash small o test this Dash
04:13 - small o
04:15 - test is the name of the executable
04:19 - file so when this test just c will be
04:23 - compiled it will be saved in the form of
04:27 - test.exe or executed
04:30 - file so and then press
04:35 - enter
04:39 - and if there is no
04:42 - error it will be compiled successfully
04:46 - now to run the test program you write
04:50 - dot slash and
04:53 - your executable file name in our
04:57 - case our executable file name name is
05:00 - this test so you'll
05:03 - write test and press enter and yes it
05:09 - shows hello
05:10 - world so in this way you can
05:13 - compile C program on your GCC
05:19 - compiler I hope this will help you in
05:22 - future for compiling the C programs and
05:26 - please write comment and subscribe and
05:29 - bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to install and compile c c program from your GCC compiler first step if you have installed open 2 freshly or new version of open2 and you have fresh with open to you need to install build essential in your open system this build essential will install GCC and g++ compiler into your system so from them you can compile your C and C++ programs so WR P sudo app getet installed build essential and press enter and ask me the permission yes working and it will be completed by the meantime the process is completing go to your folder and we will test a simple C program so create a new document in your home directory or wherever you want empty document and name it as test dot C so and open it by double clicking so go to your test do C file and make a simple hello world program include std. include STD li. in Main and print hello world and save this program here and then go to your browser by the meantime I think your build essential have have been installed so now on the terminal because this test. CPP file is on on my home folder so I don't need to go to the file but if it's located anywhere else just see the location and CD to the location and just right here GCC sorry just write GCC test.c which is your program and dash small o test this Dash small o test is the name of the executable file so when this test just c will be compiled it will be saved in the form of test.exe or executed file so and then press enter and if there is no error it will be compiled successfully now to run the test program you write dot slash and your executable file name in our case our executable file name name is this test so you'll write test and press enter and yes it shows hello world so in this way you can compile C program on your GCC compiler I hope this will help you in future for compiling the C programs and please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
