00:00 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:05 - talk about a very important tool in
00:07 - ultrix known as the count records tool
00:10 - so count record tool is present in the
00:13 - transform tab
00:15 - in the altrix it is used to return the
00:17 - count of the number of the records that
00:20 - are passing through the tool
00:22 - now
00:22 - we can use this tool when we want to
00:25 - report on the resulting record
00:28 - or the record count
00:29 - that is being used in the workflow
00:32 - um it even returns a count of a 0 as
00:35 - well
00:36 - so in case you are wondering that how
00:38 - would you get the total number of
00:40 - records then you can do that with the
00:42 - help of the count records tool
00:44 - now you can get that on the entire
00:46 - database or you can apply some filters
00:50 - and get the records that match that
00:52 - particular filter as well
00:54 - so i'm going to show you the example for
00:56 - both
00:58 - let me first get the input data tool and
01:00 - get my data that is stored in this
01:02 - output excel file the consumer sheet
01:05 - now if i just run it right now
01:09 - i would be getting all the records that
01:10 - are present in there that is a total of
01:12 - 5191 records okay
01:15 - now the thing is i'm going to uh go to
01:17 - this output and apply a filter
01:20 - over here right so let's just use this
01:23 - filter tool
01:25 - here and the filter is going to be
01:28 - a basic filter that is i want to select
01:30 - the segment where the segment value is
01:32 - let's just get a value for the segment
01:35 - uh or let's just get a value for
01:38 - say category that is equal to technology
01:42 - so let me just apply the filter that is
01:45 - for the category
01:46 - if it is equals to
01:50 - technology okay
01:52 - then run this
01:55 - and we would be getting in the true part
01:58 - we are getting 951 records and in the
02:00 - false part we are getting uh 4 000 some
02:03 - records okay
02:04 - so if you just go to the true part
02:07 - and then go to the transform tab get
02:09 - this count records uh filter or this
02:11 - count records tool and apply it over
02:13 - here
02:15 - then we just go to its output part okay
02:17 - or basically we just run this tool
02:20 - then what we are getting is 951 as the
02:23 - total because it is only added to the
02:25 - true part
02:26 - if i also connect this false part to
02:28 - here then you can see it's um not able
02:31 - to connect because
02:32 - this counter codes tool only except
02:35 - one input right so to get the number of
02:37 - the false records we add another count
02:39 - records tool and click on run
02:42 - so now for this second count records
02:44 - tool if you just click on its output
02:46 - part we are getting four two four zero
02:49 - that's the number of the records for the
02:50 - falls and this is the number of the
02:52 - records 951 is the number of records for
02:54 - the true part
02:55 - in case we decide to remove this filter
02:58 - right let me just remove this filter
03:00 - over here
03:02 - and also delete one of the counter calls
03:03 - tool then what can i do is directly
03:05 - connect my database to this count
03:07 - records tool
03:09 - now if i just run it
03:12 - then what do we get is
03:13 - 5191 that is the total number of records
03:16 - in the actual database so that's how the
03:19 - count records tool works either through
03:21 - filter or without the filter okay
03:24 - next tool that we are going to see is
03:27 - the cross tab tool so let me just save
03:29 - this workflow and move on to our second
03:31 - tool that is the cross tab tool now what
03:34 - is it uh usage of this tool it is used
03:36 - to pivot the orientation of the data in
03:38 - a table
03:39 - uh what it does is it moves the vertical
03:42 - data fields onto a horizontal axis and
03:44 - summarizes the data whenever it is
03:46 - specified
03:47 - it is in reverse application of the
03:49 - transpose tool which of course we would
03:51 - be seeing as well
03:53 - so there is no limit on the number of
03:54 - the rows or the columns that can be
03:56 - passed to this crosstab tool okay so for
03:59 - this crosstab tool what i have done is i
04:01 - have taken another database or i have
04:02 - created another database let me just use
04:04 - that because it is fairly small so it
04:06 - would be easier to understand for us
04:08 - so this database is present in the form
04:11 - of
04:12 - a named range in excel it has two
04:14 - columns the number of hours and the
04:16 - score so the name of the range is the
04:18 - scores so let me just get that click on
04:20 - ok
04:21 - this is how it is looking it has around
04:23 - 10 records okay
04:25 - it gives us the number of the hours the
04:27 - student has studied and the score that
04:28 - he has scored okay
04:30 - let's just go to the transform tab and
04:32 - get our crosstab tool over here
04:36 - now once we get there it would ask us
04:39 - that if we want to group the data by any
04:42 - of these values
04:43 - so it is all the available data values
04:46 - that are present in the data set
04:49 - if you want it to be a grouped with a
04:51 - specific value you can just select that
04:54 - next is um
04:56 - if you want to
04:58 - create a value
05:00 - or change the column headers so a new
05:02 - column would be created for each of the
05:04 - unique values in this particular um
05:07 - header so the number of hours then we
05:09 - have uh values for new columns so
05:13 - these values would be used to propagate
05:14 - the new columns that are created by the
05:16 - number of hours
05:18 - now if you want to aggregate it
05:20 - um then you can just aggregate it using
05:23 - these all options so what all options we
05:25 - have some average count
05:27 - uh percent row percent column total
05:30 - first and last
05:31 - so uh what we are going to do is just go
05:34 - with the total row and the total column
05:36 - and click on run
05:40 - now here um
05:43 - we just select on the output tab here
05:45 - this is the output that we are getting
05:47 - that is the total
05:49 - of the rows and the columns is 733
05:52 - if we just
05:53 - um
05:55 - now instead of getting this total row
05:57 - and the total column i'm changing the
05:59 - method of aggregating values to sum and
06:02 - just deselect them both and click on run
06:05 - now what would be we getting is the
06:07 - record and the uh
06:10 - sum of the scores
06:13 - over here
06:14 - so this is how it is looking so this is
06:17 - basically the usage of the crosstab tool
06:19 - in altrix
06:21 - now let us take a look at the tool that
06:23 - is very similar to the crosstab tool and
06:25 - it is known as the transpose tool so let
06:28 - me just save it
06:30 - and what is the transpose tool it is
06:32 - actually
06:36 - somewhat different from the crosstab
06:37 - tool it is used to uh pivot the
06:40 - orientation of the data table
06:43 - uh it is basically used to transform the
06:45 - data so what we can do is the horizontal
06:48 - data fields would be shown on the
06:49 - vertical axis
06:51 - it is the reverse application of the
06:53 - crosstab tool
06:55 - and it is useful for extracting the
06:57 - non-conforming data there is no limit
06:59 - again on the number of records of the
07:01 - fields that could be transformed
07:03 - so here is the input data part that is
07:06 - same with the um
07:08 - crosstab tool that we just saw that is
07:10 - the number of hours and the score
07:12 - now let's go to this transform tab and
07:15 - get this transpose tool so when we get
07:17 - this transpose tool these are the
07:19 - configuration panel options that we are
07:21 - getting first is the key columns
07:23 - so
07:24 - from here we can select the columns to
07:26 - pivot the table around
07:28 - this name remains on the horizontal axis
07:31 - with its value replicated vertically for
07:33 - each data field that is selected
07:36 - so let me just select them all
07:38 - next is the data columns now that means
07:41 - that we can select the columns to carry
07:43 - through the analysis so let's just keep
07:46 - number of hours over here and the score
07:47 - over here
07:49 - here we have an option of a dynamic or
07:51 - unknown column so if you want to go for
07:53 - a dynamic or
07:55 - unknown columns as well you can just
07:56 - keep it checked okay
07:59 - you can just go to this question mark to
08:01 - run about uh to read about it that is
08:03 - running a workflow can introduce the new
08:05 - columns that were unknown at the
08:07 - configuration time so if you want to
08:09 - include those new columns you can make
08:11 - sure that this option is checked that's
08:13 - for a
08:14 - further step towards security
08:17 - last but not the least we have the
08:19 - missing columns option
08:20 - that means what action we want to take
08:23 - if some of the columns are missing we
08:24 - want to report an error and stop
08:26 - processing the result we just want to
08:28 - throw a warning and continue on with the
08:30 - results or we just want to completely
08:32 - ignore it right so let's just keep it on
08:35 - one and click on run
08:38 - now what happens is um
08:40 - if you just click on the output panel
08:42 - this is how it's looking the number of
08:44 - hours
08:46 - uh
08:47 - is same uh the name has been changed to
08:49 - score and its value is being shown like
08:51 - this so uh basically score has been
08:55 - transposed into a horizontal row instead
08:57 - of a vertical a vertical column
09:00 - so this is what the function of the
09:01 - transpose tool is and this is what it
09:04 - has done now if you want you can compare
09:06 - it with the crosstab tool the crosstab
09:09 - tool what it did was
09:11 - it transformed the horizontal rows into
09:14 - the vertical columns now we have these
09:16 - columns for all of these values right
09:19 - but what the transpose tool did was just
09:21 - opposite of the crosstab tool it took
09:24 - the name of the column or the header of
09:26 - the column that was score and created
09:29 - multiple rows out of it the value for
09:31 - each of that was written over here like
09:34 - the value value value like this okay
09:36 - now in this transpose tool if we just
09:38 - select all the key columns and click on
09:40 - run once again
09:42 - then what would happen
09:43 - uh then we would be getting like this
09:46 - no values because we have transposed
09:48 - both of these columns so no of none of
09:50 - the values are remaining with us okay
09:54 - and let me just show you another
09:56 - possibility that is
09:58 - if i just decide to transform the number
10:01 - of hours instead of this course value so
10:03 - this is how it would be looking the
10:04 - number of hours would be taking up the
10:06 - horizontal rows and its values would be
10:09 - assigned like this with a value field so
10:11 - name and value it would be taken in the
10:13 - form of a pair
10:15 - so that's all for this video in which we
10:17 - learned about three rules of the
10:18 - transform tab
10:20 - and
10:20 - thanks for watching the video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a very important tool in ultrix known as the count records tool so count record tool is present in the transform tab in the altrix it is used to return the count of the number of the records that are passing through the tool now we can use this tool when we want to report on the resulting record or the record count that is being used in the workflow um it even returns a count of a 0 as well so in case you are wondering that how would you get the total number of records then you can do that with the help of the count records tool now you can get that on the entire database or you can apply some filters and get the records that match that particular filter as well so i'm going to show you the example for both let me first get the input data tool and get my data that is stored in this output excel file the consumer sheet now if i just run it right now i would be getting all the records that are present in there that is a total of 5191 records okay now the thing is i'm going to uh go to this output and apply a filter over here right so let's just use this filter tool here and the filter is going to be a basic filter that is i want to select the segment where the segment value is let's just get a value for the segment uh or let's just get a value for say category that is equal to technology so let me just apply the filter that is for the category if it is equals to technology okay then run this and we would be getting in the true part we are getting 951 records and in the false part we are getting uh 4 000 some records okay so if you just go to the true part and then go to the transform tab get this count records uh filter or this count records tool and apply it over here then we just go to its output part okay or basically we just run this tool then what we are getting is 951 as the total because it is only added to the true part if i also connect this false part to here then you can see it's um not able to connect because this counter codes tool only except one input right so to get the number of the false records we add another count records tool and click on run so now for this second count records tool if you just click on its output part we are getting four two four zero that's the number of the records for the falls and this is the number of the records 951 is the number of records for the true part in case we decide to remove this filter right let me just remove this filter over here and also delete one of the counter calls tool then what can i do is directly connect my database to this count records tool now if i just run it then what do we get is 5191 that is the total number of records in the actual database so that's how the count records tool works either through filter or without the filter okay next tool that we are going to see is the cross tab tool so let me just save this workflow and move on to our second tool that is the cross tab tool now what is it uh usage of this tool it is used to pivot the orientation of the data in a table uh what it does is it moves the vertical data fields onto a horizontal axis and summarizes the data whenever it is specified it is in reverse application of the transpose tool which of course we would be seeing as well so there is no limit on the number of the rows or the columns that can be passed to this crosstab tool okay so for this crosstab tool what i have done is i have taken another database or i have created another database let me just use that because it is fairly small so it would be easier to understand for us so this database is present in the form of a named range in excel it has two columns the number of hours and the score so the name of the range is the scores so let me just get that click on ok this is how it is looking it has around 10 records okay it gives us the number of the hours the student has studied and the score that he has scored okay let's just go to the transform tab and get our crosstab tool over here now once we get there it would ask us that if we want to group the data by any of these values so it is all the available data values that are present in the data set if you want it to be a grouped with a specific value you can just select that next is um if you want to create a value or change the column headers so a new column would be created for each of the unique values in this particular um header so the number of hours then we have uh values for new columns so these values would be used to propagate the new columns that are created by the number of hours now if you want to aggregate it um then you can just aggregate it using these all options so what all options we have some average count uh percent row percent column total first and last so uh what we are going to do is just go with the total row and the total column and click on run now here um we just select on the output tab here this is the output that we are getting that is the total of the rows and the columns is 733 if we just um now instead of getting this total row and the total column i'm changing the method of aggregating values to sum and just deselect them both and click on run now what would be we getting is the record and the uh sum of the scores over here so this is how it is looking so this is basically the usage of the crosstab tool in altrix now let us take a look at the tool that is very similar to the crosstab tool and it is known as the transpose tool so let me just save it and what is the transpose tool it is actually somewhat different from the crosstab tool it is used to uh pivot the orientation of the data table uh it is basically used to transform the data so what we can do is the horizontal data fields would be shown on the vertical axis it is the reverse application of the crosstab tool and it is useful for extracting the nonconforming data there is no limit again on the number of records of the fields that could be transformed so here is the input data part that is same with the um crosstab tool that we just saw that is the number of hours and the score now let's go to this transform tab and get this transpose tool so when we get this transpose tool these are the configuration panel options that we are getting first is the key columns so from here we can select the columns to pivot the table around this name remains on the horizontal axis with its value replicated vertically for each data field that is selected so let me just select them all next is the data columns now that means that we can select the columns to carry through the analysis so let's just keep number of hours over here and the score over here here we have an option of a dynamic or unknown column so if you want to go for a dynamic or unknown columns as well you can just keep it checked okay you can just go to this question mark to run about uh to read about it that is running a workflow can introduce the new columns that were unknown at the configuration time so if you want to include those new columns you can make sure that this option is checked that's for a further step towards security last but not the least we have the missing columns option that means what action we want to take if some of the columns are missing we want to report an error and stop processing the result we just want to throw a warning and continue on with the results or we just want to completely ignore it right so let's just keep it on one and click on run now what happens is um if you just click on the output panel this is how it's looking the number of hours uh is same uh the name has been changed to score and its value is being shown like this so uh basically score has been transposed into a horizontal row instead of a vertical a vertical column so this is what the function of the transpose tool is and this is what it has done now if you want you can compare it with the crosstab tool the crosstab tool what it did was it transformed the horizontal rows into the vertical columns now we have these columns for all of these values right but what the transpose tool did was just opposite of the crosstab tool it took the name of the column or the header of the column that was score and created multiple rows out of it the value for each of that was written over here like the value value value like this okay now in this transpose tool if we just select all the key columns and click on run once again then what would happen uh then we would be getting like this no values because we have transposed both of these columns so no of none of the values are remaining with us okay and let me just show you another possibility that is if i just decide to transform the number of hours instead of this course value so this is how it would be looking the number of hours would be taking up the horizontal rows and its values would be assigned like this with a value field so name and value it would be taken in the form of a pair so that's all for this video in which we learned about three rules of the transform tab and thanks for watching the video
