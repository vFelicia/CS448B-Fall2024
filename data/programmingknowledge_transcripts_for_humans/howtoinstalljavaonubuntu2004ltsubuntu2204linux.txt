00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install the
00:04 - latest version of oracle java jdk
00:07 - on your ubuntu operating system so first
00:09 - of all we are going to check
00:10 - whether java is installed on our ubuntu
00:12 - operating system or not
00:14 - so for that we need to open the terminal
00:16 - so you can just click on these
00:18 - dots here and then search for the
00:21 - terminal
00:22 - or you can press ctrl alt t
00:25 - to open a new terminal then you just
00:28 - need to give this command which is java
00:31 - hyphen hyphen
00:33 - version here now if it gives you the
00:37 - version of
00:38 - java in the output then java is
00:41 - installed
00:42 - on your ubuntu operating system and
00:45 - if it gives you this kind of output
00:48 - which i'm seeing here
00:49 - which is command java is not found but
00:52 - can be installed with
00:53 - these commands then java is not
00:56 - installed
00:56 - and ubuntu is suggesting us the
01:00 - versions of java which we can install on
01:03 - the ubuntu operating system now as you
01:06 - can see here
01:07 - we don't want to install the open jdk
01:10 - version
01:11 - of java we want to install the oracle
01:14 - java jdk
01:15 - right so if you are interested in
01:17 - installing the open jdk
01:19 - java version then you can give
01:23 - one of these commands so if you want to
01:25 - install the
01:26 - java jdk version 8 for open jdk
01:30 - you can give this command for 11 you can
01:33 - give this command
01:35 - then you have the 13 version 14 version
01:39 - nowadays the 15 version is also
01:41 - available for
01:42 - the latest version of ubuntu operating
01:45 - system so we are not interested
01:47 - in installing the open jdk we are
01:49 - interested in installing the oracle java
01:52 - jdk so let's see how we can install
01:54 - this so for that you
01:57 - need to open your favorite browser and
01:59 - then search for
02:00 - download oracle jdk and the first link
02:04 - which will appear here will be
02:05 - from oracle.com forward slash java so
02:08 - just click on this
02:09 - link i'm going to put this link in the
02:12 - description of this video also you so
02:14 - you can directly
02:15 - uh come to this website at the time of
02:18 - making this video
02:19 - java se15 is the latest version of java
02:23 - so we are going to download and install
02:25 - this version
02:27 - so you can directly see this link which
02:30 - says
02:30 - jdk download so i'm going to just click
02:32 - on this link
02:34 - and then when you will just
02:37 - scroll down here you will be able to see
02:41 - a different
02:42 - packages for different operating systems
02:45 - so the file
02:46 - we are interested in is this file which
02:49 - is
02:50 - for linux x64 debian package
02:54 - which is this file so i'm going to just
02:56 - click on this file
02:57 - and then click on the check box and then
03:01 - click on download button
03:02 - which is going to start the download of
03:05 - this file
03:06 - on my ubuntu operating system so just
03:09 - wait for
03:09 - this file to download it's around 155
03:12 - megabyte file
03:13 - so now once this dot deb file is
03:16 - downloaded i'm going to minimize
03:18 - my browser and then i'm going to go to
03:21 - my terminal once again
03:23 - let me uh clear the terminal
03:26 - and then i'm going to cd to my downloads
03:30 - directory where my downloaded file is
03:33 - there so i'm going to just do ls
03:35 - you can see this dot deb file is there
03:39 - so in order to install java using this
03:42 - dot deb file you just need to give this
03:45 - command which is
03:46 - sudo dpkg and then
03:50 - hyphen i and the name of the file which
03:53 - is jdk 15.0.2
03:56 - so i'm going to give this command i'm
03:59 - going to give
04:00 - my ubuntu's password and then press
04:02 - enter
04:03 - which is going to start the installation
04:05 - of
04:06 - java jdk on my ubuntu operating system
04:10 - so just
04:10 - wait for the installation to complete so
04:12 - once that's done
04:14 - we need two more commands and these
04:16 - commands
04:17 - are these two commands i'm going to
04:19 - provide
04:20 - all these commands in the description of
04:22 - this video also
04:24 - so you can directly copy and paste these
04:26 - commands so the first command is this
04:28 - one
04:29 - which is sudo update hyphen
04:33 - alternative space hyphen iphone install
04:37 - forward slash user bin java space
04:40 - java user lib jvm
04:44 - and here you need to provide the
04:47 - location
04:48 - of your java jdk 15 folder so let's
04:52 - give this command and it's going to give
04:55 - you uh this
04:56 - error because we have installed
04:59 - the jdk 15.0.2 version
05:03 - so it's going to create this directory
05:05 - and not
05:06 - this directory so let's ls to uh
05:10 - this user live jvm directory
05:13 - so ls user lib jvm
05:16 - and you can see we have jdk hyphen
05:19 - 15.0.2 directory and not
05:22 - this directory so just replace this
05:24 - directory name
05:26 - with this one and you will be good to go
05:29 - so i'm going to just replace this
05:32 - directory name
05:33 - with 15.0.2 here
05:36 - and then give this command and it's
05:38 - going to work
05:39 - fine same i'm going to copy the next
05:43 - command
05:44 - for the java c right so this command is
05:48 - for the java c
05:49 - right so i'm going to just copy uh this
05:52 - command
05:53 - change the directory name which is jdk
05:56 - hyphen 15.0.2
05:59 - and then press enter and everything is
06:02 - done so let me clear the terminal
06:05 - and we are going to just give the java
06:09 - hyphen hyphen version command now
06:12 - and once you press enter you will see
06:15 - that
06:16 - java 15.0.2 is installed
06:20 - on our ubuntu operating system
06:23 - you can also give java c command to
06:26 - check
06:27 - the java c version which will be same
06:29 - which is 15.0.2
06:32 - so now at this point everything is
06:34 - working and now you are good to go
06:36 - let's say you want to set the java home
06:38 - environment variable
06:40 - also for your java installation
06:43 - so for that let me clear the terminal
06:45 - once again
06:46 - and first of all i recommend you to just
06:50 - use this command which is sudo
06:53 - update hyphen alternatives space
06:56 - hyphen hyphen config java it's going to
06:59 - give you
07:00 - the location for your java
07:03 - installation folder you can see here
07:05 - right so if you are confused
07:07 - you can always use this command to
07:10 - change
07:11 - between different version of java if you
07:14 - have installed different versions of
07:16 - java on
07:16 - your ubuntu operating system this
07:18 - command is going to help you to switch
07:20 - between
07:21 - those versions also okay so now
07:25 - at this point what we are going to do we
07:27 - are going to add
07:28 - this path as the java home
07:31 - environment variable so for that you
07:34 - need to edit
07:35 - a file which is called etc profile
07:38 - file so you can use any editor of your
07:41 - choice bim
07:42 - nano i generally use g
07:46 - added to edit the file because it's
07:49 - uh relatively simple for me let's say
07:52 - so i'm going to just open this file
07:54 - which is called
07:56 - etc profile file
07:59 - and then it's going to open this file
08:03 - like this so at the end of this file
08:06 - what you need to do you need to just
08:09 - type
08:10 - java underscore home all in capital
08:14 - and without any space and then equals
08:18 - and then you need to just copy the path
08:21 - of your java jdk folder
08:25 - until the version you don't need to
08:27 - include bin
08:28 - forward slash java directory right so
08:31 - i'm going to just copy this
08:33 - and then paste this path here once you
08:36 - are done
08:37 - just ctrl s to save your file
08:40 - and then you can now exit from
08:43 - your g edit uh editor
08:46 - now in order to just update all the
08:49 - parts
08:50 - you just need to give this command which
08:52 - is
08:53 - source and then forward slash etc
08:57 - profile okay so it's going to update
09:01 - all the source paths so now once you
09:04 - give this command you can just
09:07 - see the value of your java home by
09:11 - using this command which is echo
09:14 - dollar java underscore
09:17 - home it's going to give you the path of
09:20 - this environment variable which is the
09:23 - path of your
09:24 - jdk directory so now let's develop
09:27 - a very simple java program
09:30 - and see if everything is working in
09:33 - terms of compilation and execution of
09:35 - the program
09:37 - so for that what i'm going to do is
09:39 - let's say
09:40 - i'm in my home folder you can just cd to
09:43 - the folder where you want to create your
09:45 - project so
09:46 - i'm going to just create a
09:50 - directory called let's say work okay
09:53 - and i'm going to cd to this work
09:56 - directory and then i'm going to
09:58 - create a file which is called hello dot
10:02 - java file and once this file is created
10:05 - you can see this file is created inside
10:06 - this directory
10:07 - so i'm going to use g edit
10:11 - to just open this file in the editor
10:14 - and once this file is opened in the
10:17 - editor
10:19 - and here you can write a very simple
10:21 - hello world program in
10:23 - java you can find this program anywhere
10:25 - on internet
10:27 - so just write this program
10:30 - save your file and then go to
10:34 - your terminal once again and once you
10:37 - have this program you just need to give
10:39 - this
10:39 - command which is java c and the name of
10:42 - your
10:44 - file which is hello dot java
10:47 - one thing to notice here is that
10:51 - your class name and the file name should
10:54 - be same so
10:55 - in this case my class name is hello and
10:58 - my
10:58 - file name is hello.java right
11:01 - and then just give this command this
11:04 - command is going to compile your program
11:06 - and generate this file which is called
11:10 - hello.class
11:11 - this is the binary file which you can
11:13 - use to run your program so you can just
11:17 - use now the java command and then
11:20 - hello so you just need to
11:23 - give the name you don't need to give the
11:25 - extension
11:27 - dot class for your program so so just
11:30 - give java hello and it's going to print
11:33 - the hello world or whatever program you
11:36 - want to
11:36 - execute using this java command so this
11:39 - is how you can download and install
11:42 - java on your ubuntu operating system
11:45 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
11:47 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install the latest version of oracle java jdk on your ubuntu operating system so first of all we are going to check whether java is installed on our ubuntu operating system or not so for that we need to open the terminal so you can just click on these dots here and then search for the terminal or you can press ctrl alt t to open a new terminal then you just need to give this command which is java hyphen hyphen version here now if it gives you the version of java in the output then java is installed on your ubuntu operating system and if it gives you this kind of output which i'm seeing here which is command java is not found but can be installed with these commands then java is not installed and ubuntu is suggesting us the versions of java which we can install on the ubuntu operating system now as you can see here we don't want to install the open jdk version of java we want to install the oracle java jdk right so if you are interested in installing the open jdk java version then you can give one of these commands so if you want to install the java jdk version 8 for open jdk you can give this command for 11 you can give this command then you have the 13 version 14 version nowadays the 15 version is also available for the latest version of ubuntu operating system so we are not interested in installing the open jdk we are interested in installing the oracle java jdk so let's see how we can install this so for that you need to open your favorite browser and then search for download oracle jdk and the first link which will appear here will be from oracle.com forward slash java so just click on this link i'm going to put this link in the description of this video also you so you can directly uh come to this website at the time of making this video java se15 is the latest version of java so we are going to download and install this version so you can directly see this link which says jdk download so i'm going to just click on this link and then when you will just scroll down here you will be able to see a different packages for different operating systems so the file we are interested in is this file which is for linux x64 debian package which is this file so i'm going to just click on this file and then click on the check box and then click on download button which is going to start the download of this file on my ubuntu operating system so just wait for this file to download it's around 155 megabyte file so now once this dot deb file is downloaded i'm going to minimize my browser and then i'm going to go to my terminal once again let me uh clear the terminal and then i'm going to cd to my downloads directory where my downloaded file is there so i'm going to just do ls you can see this dot deb file is there so in order to install java using this dot deb file you just need to give this command which is sudo dpkg and then hyphen i and the name of the file which is jdk 15.0.2 so i'm going to give this command i'm going to give my ubuntu's password and then press enter which is going to start the installation of java jdk on my ubuntu operating system so just wait for the installation to complete so once that's done we need two more commands and these commands are these two commands i'm going to provide all these commands in the description of this video also so you can directly copy and paste these commands so the first command is this one which is sudo update hyphen alternative space hyphen iphone install forward slash user bin java space java user lib jvm and here you need to provide the location of your java jdk 15 folder so let's give this command and it's going to give you uh this error because we have installed the jdk 15.0.2 version so it's going to create this directory and not this directory so let's ls to uh this user live jvm directory so ls user lib jvm and you can see we have jdk hyphen 15.0.2 directory and not this directory so just replace this directory name with this one and you will be good to go so i'm going to just replace this directory name with 15.0.2 here and then give this command and it's going to work fine same i'm going to copy the next command for the java c right so this command is for the java c right so i'm going to just copy uh this command change the directory name which is jdk hyphen 15.0.2 and then press enter and everything is done so let me clear the terminal and we are going to just give the java hyphen hyphen version command now and once you press enter you will see that java 15.0.2 is installed on our ubuntu operating system you can also give java c command to check the java c version which will be same which is 15.0.2 so now at this point everything is working and now you are good to go let's say you want to set the java home environment variable also for your java installation so for that let me clear the terminal once again and first of all i recommend you to just use this command which is sudo update hyphen alternatives space hyphen hyphen config java it's going to give you the location for your java installation folder you can see here right so if you are confused you can always use this command to change between different version of java if you have installed different versions of java on your ubuntu operating system this command is going to help you to switch between those versions also okay so now at this point what we are going to do we are going to add this path as the java home environment variable so for that you need to edit a file which is called etc profile file so you can use any editor of your choice bim nano i generally use g added to edit the file because it's uh relatively simple for me let's say so i'm going to just open this file which is called etc profile file and then it's going to open this file like this so at the end of this file what you need to do you need to just type java underscore home all in capital and without any space and then equals and then you need to just copy the path of your java jdk folder until the version you don't need to include bin forward slash java directory right so i'm going to just copy this and then paste this path here once you are done just ctrl s to save your file and then you can now exit from your g edit uh editor now in order to just update all the parts you just need to give this command which is source and then forward slash etc profile okay so it's going to update all the source paths so now once you give this command you can just see the value of your java home by using this command which is echo dollar java underscore home it's going to give you the path of this environment variable which is the path of your jdk directory so now let's develop a very simple java program and see if everything is working in terms of compilation and execution of the program so for that what i'm going to do is let's say i'm in my home folder you can just cd to the folder where you want to create your project so i'm going to just create a directory called let's say work okay and i'm going to cd to this work directory and then i'm going to create a file which is called hello dot java file and once this file is created you can see this file is created inside this directory so i'm going to use g edit to just open this file in the editor and once this file is opened in the editor and here you can write a very simple hello world program in java you can find this program anywhere on internet so just write this program save your file and then go to your terminal once again and once you have this program you just need to give this command which is java c and the name of your file which is hello dot java one thing to notice here is that your class name and the file name should be same so in this case my class name is hello and my file name is hello.java right and then just give this command this command is going to compile your program and generate this file which is called hello.class this is the binary file which you can use to run your program so you can just use now the java command and then hello so you just need to give the name you don't need to give the extension dot class for your program so so just give java hello and it's going to print the hello world or whatever program you want to execute using this java command so this is how you can download and install java on your ubuntu operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
