00:00 - now in this particular video we are
00:01 - going to learn about the tail command
00:03 - okay
00:04 - so similarly just like a head command
00:05 - tail is also one command but in this we
00:08 - uh like
00:10 - expect output from the downside or you
00:13 - can say that
00:14 - we try to get the output from the bottom
00:17 - of the txt file or any file
00:20 - like
00:21 - from which we want to
00:23 - like extract some kind of data like
00:25 - suppose you want to extract data from a
00:26 - log file
00:27 - like you need a last 10 number of lines
00:30 - if you need okay so in this case we can
00:33 - use the tail command okay
00:35 - so uh the basic
00:37 - uses like you can try to learn about uh
00:40 - like how you can
00:42 - read the log file using tail command and
00:44 - all these things so these are the basic
00:45 - uses of this
00:47 - so uh i have already two files uh
00:49 - states.txt and capital.txt okay so let
00:52 - me show you these two files
00:55 - so this is the content of states.txt
01:00 - and this is the content of capital.txt
01:03 - okay
01:03 - so on these two files we are going to
01:05 - use the tl command okay so i will use
01:08 - first tail command on the stress dot txt
01:10 - so what it will do let's check so it
01:12 - will just print to the
01:14 - last 10 lines
01:15 - okay
01:17 - so here you can see it is just printing
01:18 - the last 10 lines you can like get the
01:20 - one two three four five six seven eight
01:23 - nine and ten
01:24 - okay so using the simple tail and the
01:27 - file name what you will get you will get
01:29 - that by default last 10 lines but
01:31 - suppose if you want to more more lines
01:33 - suppose if you if you want 15 lines so
01:36 - how you can do it so nothing you just
01:38 - have to use hyphen n option and provide
01:40 - the number of lines which you want so i
01:42 - just want 15.
01:44 - so here i got
01:46 - the last 15 lines
01:47 - okay
01:49 - so you can use hyphen n option to get
01:51 - the last
01:52 - number of lines and similarly there is
01:55 - option of hyphen c option like which
01:57 - will provide you the like uh what you
02:00 - can say
02:02 - last number of specific bytes if you
02:04 - want suppose if i want uh
02:06 - 13 bytes
02:08 - i will do just hyphen c
02:11 - and 13
02:13 - so you can see i'm getting this west
02:15 - bengal
02:16 - let me try higher number
02:19 - 16 again i think i will get same okay
02:21 - nothing i i got like this with pangolin
02:24 - and
02:25 - okay suppose if i want uh
02:29 - 20 bytes
02:31 - sorry
02:33 - if i want how much
02:37 - 20 so as you can see
02:40 - i'm getting 20 bytes let's count like w
02:43 - 1 2 3 4 5
02:45 - 6 7 8 9 10 11
02:48 - 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
02:53 - and also there will be like uh some kind
02:55 - of particular size for the spaces also
02:58 - okay so in this way we are getting the
03:00 - 20 bytes like specific bits okay
03:02 - not bits bytes it is okay so you can use
03:05 - the hyphen c option to get the specific
03:07 - number of bits okay from a txt file or
03:10 - any kind of file
03:11 - so now if you want to get the like
03:15 - last 10 lines of both files how you can
03:18 - get it this simple use this command is
03:21 - test.rt
03:23 - hyphen and the number of lines then
03:25 - provide the files file name which you
03:27 - want so i need
03:29 - data from two files so you can see you
03:31 - can get easily like
03:33 - from capital.txt these are the last 10
03:35 - lines and from
03:36 - stress.txt these are the
03:39 - last 10 lines okay so apart from this
03:42 - there is also a like a very interesting
03:45 - thing in which you will learn in this
03:47 - particular video that is a monitoring
03:50 - any uh like any txt file suppose there
03:53 - is a log system or something like that
03:55 - and if you want to monitor it so how you
03:57 - can do it
03:59 - you you can use it to just by applying
04:02 - tail command by which option you can use
04:04 - by using hyphen f okay
04:06 - so let's do it
04:07 - [Music]
04:09 - tail hyphen f states dot txt okay
04:13 - so uh first let me show you the content
04:16 - of stress dot txt so that will be clear
04:18 - to you so you can see at the end we have
04:20 - only west bengal okay
04:22 - so now i will use tail hyphen f states
04:25 - dot txt and here you can see like it has
04:28 - rendered the last 10 lines and it is my
04:30 - monitoring this file so now what i will
04:33 - do i will just open up the again new
04:35 - terminal
04:37 - i hope it is visible to you i will move
04:39 - into the
04:40 - head directory
04:42 - [Music]
04:43 - and i have these two files and what i am
04:45 - going to do i will
04:47 - append some data in stress dot txt
04:52 - and then here you
04:54 - you can see
04:58 - if i write something then it should
05:01 - reflect here
05:03 - hello okay so you can see hello has been
05:06 - added if i want uh
05:10 - if i want to print linux
05:14 - for
05:15 - india
05:16 - so here you can see whatever i'm writing
05:19 - here whatever i'm adding in this
05:20 - particular file it is get monitored by
05:22 - this system like tell if we have used
05:25 - hyphen f option to monitor this test.txt
05:27 - file so whatever we are doing changes in
05:30 - that particular file it is reflecting
05:32 - here so in like this you can also use
05:34 - this uh particular thing in the
05:37 - like
05:38 - log monitoring system okay
05:40 - so hope you liked it like that was the
05:42 - interesting part of this particular
05:43 - video i hope you liked it suppose we
05:46 - write anything else okay so here you can
05:48 - see it is getting
05:49 - like reflecting here okay and all these
05:52 - things will get added into this
05:54 - particular stress dot txt file now i
05:56 - will just save it
05:58 - and now again i will try to
06:00 - check the content so here you can see
06:02 - all those extra content has been added
06:04 - in that particular
06:05 - taste.txt file so that was the like most
06:09 - important or you can say most
06:11 - interesting thing of this particular
06:13 - video so i hope you liked it and
06:16 - please if you have any queries regarding
06:17 - this video so then you can ask us in the
06:19 - comment section okay so we will meet in
06:21 - the next video so thank you thank you

now in this particular video we are going to learn about the tail command okay so similarly just like a head command tail is also one command but in this we uh like expect output from the downside or you can say that we try to get the output from the bottom of the txt file or any file like from which we want to like extract some kind of data like suppose you want to extract data from a log file like you need a last 10 number of lines if you need okay so in this case we can use the tail command okay so uh the basic uses like you can try to learn about uh like how you can read the log file using tail command and all these things so these are the basic uses of this so uh i have already two files uh states.txt and capital.txt okay so let me show you these two files so this is the content of states.txt and this is the content of capital.txt okay so on these two files we are going to use the tl command okay so i will use first tail command on the stress dot txt so what it will do let's check so it will just print to the last 10 lines okay so here you can see it is just printing the last 10 lines you can like get the one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten okay so using the simple tail and the file name what you will get you will get that by default last 10 lines but suppose if you want to more more lines suppose if you if you want 15 lines so how you can do it so nothing you just have to use hyphen n option and provide the number of lines which you want so i just want 15. so here i got the last 15 lines okay so you can use hyphen n option to get the last number of lines and similarly there is option of hyphen c option like which will provide you the like uh what you can say last number of specific bytes if you want suppose if i want uh 13 bytes i will do just hyphen c and 13 so you can see i'm getting this west bengal let me try higher number 16 again i think i will get same okay nothing i i got like this with pangolin and okay suppose if i want uh 20 bytes sorry if i want how much 20 so as you can see i'm getting 20 bytes let's count like w 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and also there will be like uh some kind of particular size for the spaces also okay so in this way we are getting the 20 bytes like specific bits okay not bits bytes it is okay so you can use the hyphen c option to get the specific number of bits okay from a txt file or any kind of file so now if you want to get the like last 10 lines of both files how you can get it this simple use this command is test.rt hyphen and the number of lines then provide the files file name which you want so i need data from two files so you can see you can get easily like from capital.txt these are the last 10 lines and from stress.txt these are the last 10 lines okay so apart from this there is also a like a very interesting thing in which you will learn in this particular video that is a monitoring any uh like any txt file suppose there is a log system or something like that and if you want to monitor it so how you can do it you you can use it to just by applying tail command by which option you can use by using hyphen f okay so let's do it tail hyphen f states dot txt okay so uh first let me show you the content of stress dot txt so that will be clear to you so you can see at the end we have only west bengal okay so now i will use tail hyphen f states dot txt and here you can see like it has rendered the last 10 lines and it is my monitoring this file so now what i will do i will just open up the again new terminal i hope it is visible to you i will move into the head directory and i have these two files and what i am going to do i will append some data in stress dot txt and then here you you can see if i write something then it should reflect here hello okay so you can see hello has been added if i want uh if i want to print linux for india so here you can see whatever i'm writing here whatever i'm adding in this particular file it is get monitored by this system like tell if we have used hyphen f option to monitor this test.txt file so whatever we are doing changes in that particular file it is reflecting here so in like this you can also use this uh particular thing in the like log monitoring system okay so hope you liked it like that was the interesting part of this particular video i hope you liked it suppose we write anything else okay so here you can see it is getting like reflecting here okay and all these things will get added into this particular stress dot txt file now i will just save it and now again i will try to check the content so here you can see all those extra content has been added in that particular taste.txt file so that was the like most important or you can say most interesting thing of this particular video so i hope you liked it and please if you have any queries regarding this video so then you can ask us in the comment section okay so we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching
