00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can add JavaFX support
00:05 - in your Eclipse IDE now by default
00:08 - Eclipse doesn't provide any JavaFX
00:11 - support for you so you need to add
00:14 - JavaFX support in your Eclipse IDE so
00:18 - there are two ways you can add JavaFX
00:20 - support in your Eclipse IDE one is by
00:25 - adding a jar file to your Java project
00:28 - or other is to add a Java FX plug-in and
00:33 - then you will be able to directly create
00:36 - a Java FX project so we will see both
00:39 - ways so first way is to add the Java FX
00:43 - jar file so go to your Eclipse IDE and
00:49 - create a new Java project from here and
00:53 - I'm going to name it as Java FX demo for
01:00 - example and click Next and click finish
01:04 - and then go to your project and here we
01:11 - are going to create a new class called
01:15 - hello world for example so right click
01:19 - on it and create a new class and name it
01:22 - as HelloWorld okay now to add a Java FX
01:27 - support in this class or in this project
01:31 - what you need to do is you need to
01:34 - right-click your project first so
01:36 - right-click your project and go to the
01:38 - properties and in here go to the build
01:43 - path so in here you on the right hand
01:46 - side you will be able to see this
01:48 - category called build path and this
01:51 - category go to the category called
01:53 - libraries ok now select the default
01:58 - library here and you can remove it for
02:02 - now and then you can add this library
02:06 - once again so add library and then just
02:10 - select JRE system library
02:12 - okay click Next and here by default I
02:17 - have JDK 8 installed in my system which
02:21 - is the latest version of JDK but JavaFX
02:26 - is available on JDK 7 also so if you
02:30 - have JDK 7 it's ok right
02:33 - so click finish here and now this is the
02:36 - important stage so once again click on
02:41 - add library here and then click user
02:45 - library and click next and by default
02:50 - I can see Java FX here but for the first
02:53 - time when you come here you will not be
02:56 - able to see this because I have created
02:58 - this so what I'm going to do is I'm
03:01 - going to click this option which says
03:03 - user libraries and I'm going to remove
03:06 - this for now so I select it and remove
03:09 - it and I'm going to add it once again so
03:12 - I will click new here and I will name it
03:15 - as Java FX ok click OK and now you just
03:25 - select this and then click this option
03:28 - called add external jars ok so click
03:32 - this option add external jars and then
03:36 - you need to browse to your Java folder
03:41 - wherever its installed
03:43 - most probably it will be installed in
03:45 - your C directory then go to Program
03:49 - Files and then you will be able to see
03:51 - this Java folder in this Java folder you
03:54 - need to go to this JDK folder and in
03:57 - this JDK folder go to the JRE folder ok
04:02 - and inside this JRE folder go to Lib
04:05 - folder and inside this Lib folder you
04:10 - will be able to see a jar file called
04:14 - GFX SWT dot jar select this and click
04:21 - open ok and now you can see this jar
04:25 - file is added
04:26 - to your user libraries so just click OK
04:29 - and click finish and click ok so now
04:34 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
04:36 - paste here the sample Java FX code so
04:41 - this is the sample Java FX code we are
04:43 - going to look this code in details in
04:46 - the next video I will show you how it
04:49 - works
04:50 - step-by-step but right now we want to
04:53 - check whether this Java FX support is
04:56 - working in our Eclipse IDE or not so
04:59 - this is the sample code for Java FX I
05:03 - will save it and now I am going to
05:05 - compile and run it so I'm going to just
05:08 - click this green button here and it will
05:11 - build this and it's running this Java FX
05:16 - sample code so now we know that this
05:20 - Java FX support is added in our project
05:25 - now there is a second way to add a Java
05:28 - FX support in your Eclipse IDE and this
05:32 - option will enable you to create a Java
05:34 - FX project from this file option itself
05:39 - so let's see how we can add this Java FX
05:43 - support using this Java FX plug-in in
05:47 - Eclipse so in your Eclipse IDE go to
05:51 - help and then choose the option which
05:54 - says install new software and in here
05:59 - what you need to do is I will give you a
06:02 - link in the description and you need to
06:05 - copy this link from here and paste it in
06:09 - here where you see work with ok
06:15 - so paste this link there and then just
06:18 - click Add and you need to give a name to
06:21 - your repository so give a name like this
06:25 - e in the bracket FX then outside the
06:30 - bracket clips ok so give this name to
06:35 - your repository ok so just copy the link
06:39 - from the
06:40 - description and then give this name to
06:43 - your repository and click OK and it's
06:46 - going to search this JavaFX plugin
06:49 - support so just select all from here
06:52 - right and then click Next and in here
06:55 - you just need to click once again next
06:58 - and in here you just need to read this
07:02 - license terms and condition and if you
07:05 - agree with these license terms and
07:07 - condition just click I accept the terms
07:10 - and condition and then click finish
07:13 - now it's going to install this Java FX
07:17 - plug-in in your Eclipse IDE so you need
07:20 - to wait for that
07:29 - you
07:33 - and once the installation is complete
07:36 - eclipse will ask you to restart this
07:39 - Eclipse IDE so you just need to click
07:42 - yes and it's going to restart your
07:45 - Eclipse IDE
07:48 - and once your Eclipse IDE has been
07:51 - started you can go to files here and
07:54 - then you can go to new and you can
07:58 - create a new project here and in the
08:01 - projects you will be able to see this
08:04 - new option called JavaFX now after
08:07 - installing this plug-in right and here
08:10 - you can select JavaFX project and click
08:13 - Next and in here you can give the name
08:16 - to your project for example Java FX 2
08:20 - and click Next
08:22 - and click finish now go to the project
08:27 - which you have recently created and in
08:30 - here you will be able to see this Java
08:32 - FX jar is already installed here and
08:35 - then you can go to the source folder
08:38 - here and inside the source folder you
08:40 - will be able to see a package called
08:42 - application and inside the package you
08:45 - will be able to see two files one is a
08:48 - Java file another is a CSS file so we
08:52 - will open this main dot Java file and we
08:56 - have already some default code here
08:59 - right so we can run this by just
09:03 - clicking this green button once again
09:04 - and now you can see the sample Java FX
09:10 - window here which is called stage which
09:13 - is right now blank ok so these are the
09:17 - two ways you can use to create a Java FX
09:22 - project in Eclipse I hope you enjoyed

important stage so once again click on add library here and then click user library and click next and by default I can see Java FX here but for the first time when you come here you will not be able to see this because I have created this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click this option which says user libraries and I'm going to remove this for now so I select it and remove it and I'm

Eclipse IDE and once your Eclipse IDE has been started you can go to files here and then you can go to new and you can create a new project here and in the projects you will be able to see this new option called JavaFX now after installing this plugin right and here you can select JavaFX project and click Next and in here you can give the name to your project for example Java FX 2 and click Next
