00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Maven tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can download
00:07 - and install and set up Maven on our
00:10 - Windows operating system now before
00:12 - installing Maven you need to make sure
00:15 - that Java jdk is installed on your
00:18 - Windows operating system and Java home
00:21 - variable is already added to your
00:24 - environment variable so to check this
00:27 - just open your uh search box and just
00:30 - search for system here and open the
00:33 - system from here and in here open
00:37 - advanced system settings and in the
00:39 - advanced system setting you need to
00:42 - press this button which says environment
00:44 - variables and in here you need to make
00:47 - sure that this Java unor home is set up
00:52 - in your user variables and the path of
00:56 - this Java home should indicate the path
01:00 - of jdk folder in your Windows operating
01:03 - system so for example when I copy this
01:07 - path and I open my folder Explorer or
01:11 - file explorer and paste this path it
01:14 - should open the jdk folder here right
01:18 - and if you're not sure how you can do
01:21 - this or how you can install Java jdk and
01:25 - set up Java environment variables then I
01:29 - will paste the link of the video in the
01:32 - description which shows exactly how and
01:36 - what to do in order to install Java jdk
01:40 - and set up this Java home environment
01:43 - variable you also need to make sure that
01:46 - in the path variable this is indicating
01:49 - this uh Java jdk bin folder so this bin
01:53 - folder must be added to your system
01:57 - variables in system variables so search
02:00 - for path and when you double click on it
02:02 - at the end or you need to search for
02:05 - this path which is uh C program file
02:08 - Java your uh jdk folder name and then
02:11 - bin okay and if it's not there you need
02:14 - to add it at the end of it using
02:18 - semicolon okay once everything is done
02:22 - and you are sure that uh these
02:24 - environment variables are set up on your
02:27 - system then we are ready to install uh
02:31 - Maven on our system so open your
02:34 - favorite browser and search for uh
02:36 - download Maven and the first link which
02:38 - will appear here will be from mavon do
02:42 - apache.org g/d download so just click
02:45 - this link and in here you can uh you
02:49 - know see different links here and if you
02:52 - reach to the home page if you land to
02:55 - the homepage then you can just click
02:57 - this download uh button here and you
03:00 - will reach to this place right now in
03:03 - order to download Maven you have
03:06 - different options listed here but what
03:09 - we are interested in is this option
03:11 - which says
03:13 - Apache minus Maven minus the version of
03:17 - the maven which is 3.3.9 at the time of
03:20 - making this video hyphen bin. zip file
03:24 - so we need to download this ZIP file in
03:27 - order to install Maven so just choose
03:29 - the second option and save it at your
03:33 - desired location okay now once your
03:37 - download is complete go to the location
03:39 - where this ZIP file is located and th
03:42 - just open this ZIP file and extract it
03:45 - to your desired location in my case I'm
03:48 - going to extract it to my C directory
03:52 - okay so just choose this and extract it
03:55 - once the extraction is done we can uh
03:58 - browse to a our Apache Maven folder in
04:02 - the C directory and we can see there are
04:05 - some uh folders here the one folder we
04:09 - are interested in is this bin folder in
04:12 - which our MAV executable files are there
04:16 - so next step is to open your system once
04:20 - again so just search for system and open
04:23 - it and once again go to Advanced system
04:27 - settings and once again go to
04:29 - environment variables now in here what
04:33 - you need to do is we need to go to user
04:35 - variables and we need to create a new
04:37 - user variable so just click this uh new
04:40 - button here and the new user variable
04:43 - name would be M2 uncore home in capital
04:48 - okay and uh the value of it will be your
04:52 - Apache folder so this is the value in my
04:56 - case it's uh C directory and in my C
04:59 - directory I have this Apache Maven
05:01 - folder right don't go up to bin folder
05:05 - but just go at the top level of this
05:08 - Apache folder which is Apache folder
05:11 - itself okay so copy this path and then
05:14 - paste it here and then click okay now
05:18 - some project still uses some other name
05:22 - for this uh M2 home which is Maven home
05:26 - so it's uh useful to create one more
05:30 - user variable which is Maven home so
05:33 - just write
05:35 - Maven
05:37 - homecore home okay so because some of
05:41 - the programs still references Maven
05:43 - folder with this name it's not harmful
05:46 - to create this uh environment variable
05:50 - and the value of it will be the same
05:52 - c/ Apache Maven and the version of your
05:57 - Maven folder Okay click click okay and
06:00 - once this is done the last step is to
06:05 - just go inside your bin directory here
06:08 - and then copy this path up to bin inside
06:12 - the Apache folder and once again go to
06:15 - your environment variables and in the
06:17 - environment variables just search for
06:20 - the variable called path and just open
06:22 - it and then append this path at the end
06:26 - of uh this line so I'm going to just uh
06:30 - give this semicolon and then paste this
06:33 - path to my path variable and then click
06:37 - okay and then click okay and then click
06:40 - okay now Maven is installed in our
06:44 - system so in order to check it what we
06:47 - can do in order to check that Maven is
06:50 - installed in our system we can open our
06:53 - Command Prompt so just right click on
06:55 - your uh start button and then open
06:59 - command prompt form here and then here
07:02 - just give mvn minus version here and
07:06 - then press enter and it's going to give
07:10 - you the version of Maven installed on
07:13 - your system and uh it's also going to
07:16 - show you the Java version and it's going
07:19 - to show you the Java home uh directory
07:22 - also so if it gives these informations
07:26 - uh into your terminal then Maven is is
07:30 - installed on your system so that's it
07:32 - for this video from the next video we
07:34 - are going to see how we can create our
07:37 - first Maven project so stay tuned and
07:40 - please RIT comment and subscribe and bye
07:41 - for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video on Maven tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can download and install and set up Maven on our Windows operating system now before installing Maven you need to make sure that Java jdk is installed on your Windows operating system and Java home variable is already added to your environment variable so to check this just open your uh search box and just search for system here and open the system from here and in here open advanced system settings and in the advanced system setting you need to press this button which says environment variables and in here you need to make sure that this Java unor home is set up in your user variables and the path of this Java home should indicate the path of jdk folder in your Windows operating system so for example when I copy this path and I open my folder Explorer or file explorer and paste this path it should open the jdk folder here right and if you're not sure how you can do this or how you can install Java jdk and set up Java environment variables then I will paste the link of the video in the description which shows exactly how and what to do in order to install Java jdk and set up this Java home environment variable you also need to make sure that in the path variable this is indicating this uh Java jdk bin folder so this bin folder must be added to your system variables in system variables so search for path and when you double click on it at the end or you need to search for this path which is uh C program file Java your uh jdk folder name and then bin okay and if
