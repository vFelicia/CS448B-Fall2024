00:00 - hello friends let's skip the programming
00:01 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:04 - to copy the data from one table to the
00:07 - another Trevor
00:08 - so for this particular operation we are
00:11 - going to use insert into select
00:13 - statement insert into select Testament
00:16 - basically copies data from one table and
00:19 - insert it into the another double
00:21 - now before we use select insert into
00:27 - select statement there are some
00:29 - conditions the first condition is that
00:32 - insert into select requires that data
00:35 - types in source and target table must be
00:38 - match and it is kind of obvious because
00:40 - we cannot copy the data of string type
00:43 - into the table which column has data
00:46 - type of integer and if your target table
00:50 - has already contained some type of 10 it
00:52 - won't get affected okay so let me just
00:56 - open terminal mask you okay so which are
01:12 - the data base that we have so we have
01:15 - data test data base here just use that
01:22 - which are the tables okay so we have to
01:29 - run double and m2 table so which are the
01:35 - records which stops wrong we have roll
01:41 - number which has the type of integer
01:44 - name and Sun and a type of work so let
01:49 - me just create one table create table
01:55 - then name of the table - let us say the
02:02 - first column will be ID the data will be
02:06 - integer
02:07 - the second is name where a data type
02:12 - we provide length let's say 60 the
02:18 - surname working which is also 60 and
02:28 - lastly primary here which will be our ID
02:35 - okay so let me just show you the tables
02:42 - okay so we have created our new table
02:46 - don't look now what we will do we will
02:51 - copy the data from student table and
02:56 - insert into student to table okay so let
03:01 - me just show you which are the records
03:04 - present in stone table okay so these are
03:14 - the records present in our database and
03:21 - now let me just fire the Select query
03:26 - insert into select query insert into now
03:34 - we want to insert into the mutable base
03:37 - in this case student to table which is
03:39 - also called the target table so we write
03:42 - don't - and we want to select data from
03:48 - - on table so select star from student
03:56 - and if you want to provide some
03:59 - condition then we can use like where and
04:03 - then write condition but we don't write
04:06 - any condition here we just want to copy
04:08 - all the records from the current table
04:12 - to the new table okay so as you can see
04:16 - six rows affected now let me select from
04:21 - Scranton
04:23 - and you can see the data is a present in
04:27 - stone table now copied into our new
04:30 - table which is called student to table
04:33 - now there are some various and in insert
04:36 - into select statement I have specified s
04:40 - trick here that means that I want to
04:43 - copy all the columns from the source
04:47 - table to the new table which is stuck at
04:49 - table in this case run to table if you
04:53 - do not want that then you can use column
04:59 - name here if you want to copy particular
05:02 - column from the source table into target
05:05 - happen then you can do that
05:07 - let me just create an open - gilben
05:11 - bench let us see the type of example
05:22 - delete first of all delete start from
05:28 - Toronto sorry
05:33 - delete from Toronto show you okay so
05:49 - okay so I delete all the records to
05:53 - perform the new Kaveri
05:54 - so let me write I want to copy only ID
06:02 - and name I don't want to copy the
06:04 - service
06:04 - okay so insert into Toronto
06:17 - and which are the columns
06:20 - IRD and name select roll number and name
06:33 - from the student table from stir so what
06:44 - I have done here I want to copy on the
06:46 - roll number and name which are present
06:49 - in front table I want to copy a roll
06:52 - number in ID and name into the name of
06:55 - this student to table okay let me just
06:58 - fire this okay and let us see select
07:05 - star from student to as you can see only
07:09 - the ID and name these two columns copied
07:12 - from the source table which don't ever
07:16 - in this new table which is student to
07:18 - table so this is how we can copy data
07:21 - from one table to another thanks for
07:23 - watching

hello friends let's skip the programming knowledge in this video we will see how to copy the data from one table to the another Trevor so for this particular operation we are going to use insert into select statement insert into select Testament basically copies data from one table and insert it into the another double now before we use select insert into select statement there are some conditions the first condition is that insert into select requires that data types in source and target table must be match and it is kind of obvious because we cannot copy the data of string type into the table which column has data type of integer and if your target table has already contained some type of 10 it won't get affected okay so let me just open terminal mask you okay so which are the data base that we have so we have data test data base here just use that which are the tables okay so we have to run double and m2 table so which are the records which stops wrong we have roll number which has the type of integer name and Sun and a type of work so let me just create one table create table then name of the table let us say the first column will be ID the data will be integer the second is name where a data type we provide length let's say 60 the surname working which is also 60 and lastly primary here which will be our ID okay so let me just show you the tables okay so we have created our new table don't look now what we will do we will copy the data from student table and insert into student to table okay so let me just show you which are the records present in stone table okay so these are the records present in our database and now let me just fire the Select query insert into select query insert into now we want to insert into the mutable base in this case student to table which is also called the target table so we write don't and we want to select data from on table so select star from student and if you want to provide some condition then we can use like where and then write condition but we don't write any condition here we just want to copy all the records from the current table to the new table okay so as you can see six rows affected now let me select from Scranton and you can see the data is a present in stone table now copied into our new table which is called student to table now there are some various and in insert into select statement I have specified s trick here that means that I want to copy all the columns from the source table to the new table which is stuck at table in this case run to table if you do not want that then you can use column name here if you want to copy particular column from the source table into target happen then you can do that let me just create an open gilben bench let us see the type of example delete first of all delete start from Toronto sorry delete from Toronto show you okay so okay so I delete all the records to perform the new Kaveri so let me write I want to copy only ID and name I don't want to copy the service okay so insert into Toronto and which are the columns IRD and name select roll number and name from the student table from stir so what I have done here I want to copy on the roll number and name which are present in front table I want to copy a roll number in ID and name into the name of this student to table okay let me just fire this okay and let us see select star from student to as you can see only the ID and name these two columns copied from the source table which don't ever in this new table which is student to table so this is how we can copy data from one table to another thanks for watching
