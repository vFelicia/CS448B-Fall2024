00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using HTML 5
00:06 - in this video we will see how to use
00:09 - meta tags in
00:11 - HTML now first of all what is a metad
00:15 - data a metadata is something which shows
00:20 - you the information about your real data
00:25 - right so a metadata will not be
00:29 - displayed on the page but will be
00:32 - machine passible so for example some
00:35 - search engine wants to uh pass your web
00:39 - page they will look at your metadata and
00:42 - pass your web page and even index your
00:45 - web page on their search result on the
00:48 - basis of metadata there are variety of
00:51 - parameters on which uh the search result
00:54 - depends and metadata is one of them okay
00:59 - now what can be a metadata a metadata
01:03 - can be a description or a keyword or you
01:07 - can add the author of this document or
01:10 - you can add when this document was
01:13 - modified or other metadata which I'm
01:16 - going to show you now how you add this
01:19 - metad data so generally you add this
01:22 - metadata using meta tag inside your head
01:27 - so go inside your head and just write
01:31 - meta and we have two or three attributes
01:35 - for our meta tag one is name and name is
01:42 - the name of the attribute we are going
01:44 - to add the second one is the content and
01:49 - content will be the value of the
01:52 - attribute which is related to this uh
01:56 - name okay so for example we want to add
01:59 - the description we just add description
02:02 - attribute name now for example I want to
02:04 - make this page for HTML tutorials so
02:09 - this description can be HTML tutorials
02:11 - for beginners or some other description
02:15 - related to the HTML tutorials right and
02:19 - in the same way you can add one more
02:22 - meta tag and this can be the keywords so
02:27 - here you can add keywords and these key
02:29 - keyword uh are preferred to be related
02:33 - with your web page content so this is
02:37 - for HTML tutorial for example so I can
02:40 - add keyword like HTML HTML 5 tutorials
02:44 - CSS or HTML X or Java Script for example
02:49 - so these can be some uh example uh
02:53 - keywords you can add to this page right
02:57 - now the maximum length is not limited
03:00 - for the description or the keyword but
03:03 - the preferred length for description is
03:06 - about 160 characters because after this
03:10 - Google Search or other search engines
03:12 - Cuts your description and pass only up
03:15 - to 160 characters of description in the
03:19 - same way for keywords you can add around
03:22 - 200 characters of uh keywords you can
03:25 - add any number of keyword but uh you
03:28 - know it's preferred to have 200
03:30 - characters right now in the same way you
03:33 - can add one more meta tag which is the
03:36 - author of your content for example now
03:39 - there is one more kind of uh meta tag
03:43 - which is called robot so just write
03:46 - robot and what is it related to the
03:49 - robots metat tag provides directive for
03:53 - search engine crowers and you can have
03:56 - archive no archive as a Content or
03:59 - follow or no follow as a Content or
04:02 - image or no image index as a Content or
04:06 - index or no index so if you use archive
04:10 - or no archive it indicates that whether
04:14 - or not the page should be archived by
04:17 - the search engine or not in case of
04:20 - follow or no follow this indicates
04:22 - whether or not the robot should continue
04:25 - to crwl over Pages referenced in the
04:28 - hyperlinks on the page in a similar way
04:31 - image index and no image index works and
04:34 - it indicates whether or not the page
04:37 - should appear on the referral for images
04:40 - for your search engine for your web page
04:43 - right and uh index and no index
04:46 - indicates whether or not page should be
04:48 - included in the search engine index or
04:50 - not okay so generally we use index and
04:55 - follow as our robot meta tags now there
04:59 - is one more uh meta tag which is called
05:03 - HTTP
05:04 - equivalent and here if you write refresh
05:07 - and if you uh set any content for
05:10 - example 1 second and you save your code
05:13 - and refresh your web page then it'll
05:17 - load after every second okay so it will
05:20 - refresh after every second you can see
05:23 - here it's refreshing okay and here you
05:26 - can give uh 1 second or 2 second or 10
05:30 - second or 30 second so whatever number
05:33 - you give here it will be refreshed after
05:36 - these many number of seconds okay so
05:40 - these are some of the most uh used meta
05:44 - tags which you can use in your HTML web
05:48 - page I hope you have enjoyed this video
