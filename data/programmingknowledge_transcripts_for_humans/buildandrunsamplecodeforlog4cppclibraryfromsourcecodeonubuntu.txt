00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:04 - video I will show you how you can
00:07 - download install and
00:10 - run sample program from log for
00:15 - CPP so what is lock for CPP lock for CPP
00:20 - is a C++ library from which you can
00:25 - prepare logging
00:27 - files and sometimes it's
00:32 - really good and essential for
00:36 - your application to have lock for
00:40 - CPP so let's get started and First Step
00:45 - you need to do is go to log for
00:48 - cp. source.net there you can
00:53 - find information about log for CPP and
00:57 - what are the cap capabilities and how
00:59 - you can download and install lock for
01:02 - CPP so first step is to download the LI
01:07 - Library so go to
01:11 - downloads and click download page and
01:15 - you will be directed to the source
01:23 - Forge repository and you can download
01:27 - the
01:28 - latest zip file for log for
01:33 - CPP so click download and
01:38 - download and your
01:41 - system there is uh something I want to
01:44 - say that I
01:46 - will install and compile this log for
01:49 - CPP on my UB 2 12.10 operating
01:54 - system so all the step will be specific
01:57 - to open to Linux
02:01 - and you
02:02 - can take a tip from these instruction
02:06 - and Implement on your own operating
02:10 - system also different operating system
02:14 - so what you need to do is to download
02:18 - this tar file and extract it to the
02:25 - folder of your
02:27 - choice so I have extracted this log for
02:32 - C CPP in my home folder of my Linux
02:37 - operating
02:39 - system okay
02:42 - now we once again go to the log for
02:47 - CPP website of log for CPP source.net
02:54 - and here it says the step steps
03:00 - to configure and make and make
03:04 - install for the untu sorry for
03:08 - the C log for C++
03:13 - Library
03:15 - so I
03:19 - have followed these steps and from my
03:23 - experience what I have faced and what
03:28 - experience I have with
03:30 - lock C for CPP I have
03:37 - written this documentation in my
03:42 - blog my blog name is uh
03:46 - www. programming knowledge blog. blogs
03:51 - spot. day or what
03:54 - com and here when you go to the
03:58 - labels just click log for CPP this one
04:04 - and it will open these
04:10 - this procedure what procedure you need
04:13 - to follow in order to install and run
04:16 - your first sample program from log for
04:20 - CPP so let's get started from the first
04:26 - step which is going to the directory of
04:30 - log for
04:35 - CPP and we will open our
04:40 - terminal and
04:43 - here we will go to the directory which
04:46 - is CD log for CPP because it's in my
04:50 - home
04:51 - directory and then type second step is
04:56 - to configure these this Library so I
04:59 - will write dot
05:05 - slash slash.
05:08 - configure and press
05:14 - enter and it will start configuring this
05:18 - file into your
05:27 - system while it's configuring let's see
05:30 - what next we need to
05:33 - do so I will come to my blog entry after
05:38 - configuring you need to
05:41 - make this file and then make check and
05:46 - make
05:48 - install
05:56 - Okay so the configuration is done and
06:01 - now the third step is to make the
06:04 - program so once again in the terminal
06:08 - type make and press enter and it will
06:13 - start making your
06:16 - [Music]
06:23 - program so uh now your make is also done
06:27 - so next step is
06:30 - to perform make check so I will write
06:37 - pseudo
06:40 - make
06:44 - check and press
06:48 - enter it will ask for my
06:52 - password and press
06:58 - enter and and it will start
07:02 - checking for your
07:13 - make so our make check is also performed
07:17 - successfully if our make check is
07:20 - performed successfully you can see this
07:22 - all 10 test
07:24 - passed the next step is to
07:30 - install so write
07:34 - sudo
07:36 - make
07:39 - install and press
07:44 - enter and it will
07:48 - install lock for cpv file into your
07:52 - system and this is complete
07:55 - also so our first stage of of
08:00 - configuring and making lock for CPP file
08:04 - is
08:05 - complete now what we will do is we will
08:10 - make a sample program which is given on
08:14 - the lock for
08:15 - CPP
08:17 - website and then we will compile and run
08:21 - that
08:22 - program so what I will do first
08:27 - is I will go into my home folder and I
08:32 - will
08:36 - make a document blank
08:45 - document
08:50 - and I will name it
08:53 - as log for
08:56 - CPP
08:58 - Dot
09:06 - CPP
09:09 - file
09:11 - and enter so this will create a CPP file
09:15 - for me and then I will open this
09:20 - file and it must be
09:24 - blank and what I will do is I will go to
09:28 - log for CPP
09:38 - website
09:44 - yeah
09:53 - and at the
09:56 - bottom they have given a sample exit
09:59 - example
10:00 - for log for
10:03 - CPP so we
10:06 - will try to compile
10:10 - and run this
10:13 - example I will just copy this simple
10:21 - example
10:22 - [Music]
10:24 - and copy and
10:27 - paste and to my blank log for
10:32 - CPP file which I have
10:36 - made
10:37 - [Music]
10:39 - recently okay and then I will save
10:44 - it my file is saved
10:49 - now and
10:52 - then once
10:54 - again I will go to my
10:58 - terminal
10:59 - and I will perform CD because my log for
11:03 - CPP file is my in my home folder so I
11:08 - will perform the other step from here I
11:11 - will clear this
11:14 - [Music]
11:17 - screen and I will go to my
11:21 - blog
11:24 - entry
11:26 - here
11:27 - on
11:29 - www. programming
11:31 - knowledge blog. Blogspot
11:35 - doday and here I have written the
11:38 - compilation
11:40 - method
11:47 - and yeah
11:49 - okay
11:51 - so to compile this log for CPP
11:57 - file or s simple example you need to
12:01 - copy this
12:03 - command from
12:05 - there from my blog or I will just show
12:10 - you what to write compile this log for
12:15 - CPP and paste it
12:17 - here so to compile this program you need
12:21 - to write
12:27 - g++ space
12:29 - minus
12:31 - GS T
12:33 - ABS
12:35 - plusus
12:37 - w
12:38 - space minus I
12:42 - headers space your log for CPP file
12:47 - name
12:50 - space-
12:51 - O your log for CPP executable file names
12:56 - which you want to produce
12:59 - and
13:02 - then
13:04 - space l log for
13:08 - CPP
13:09 - space- L
13:12 - PT
13:15 - read okay and then I will press enter to
13:21 - compile
13:24 - this CPP
13:27 - file and yes it's compiled
13:34 - successfully
13:39 - but first of all I will show you this is
13:42 - the executable file my program has
13:46 - generated by compiling this command g++
13:52 - command which you can copy it from my
13:55 - blog and now we will execute
14:01 - our executable file which is
14:06 - generated
14:10 - and when you execute
14:16 - this executable file it will show an
14:23 - error which shows
14:27 - that your or error while loading share
14:31 - shared
14:33 - Library lib log for CPP doso
14:38 - do5 cannot open shared object file no
14:43 - such file or
14:46 - directory this error will
14:49 - come this error you can
14:53 - eliminate by this
14:56 - line which is
15:01 - simply you need
15:05 - to
15:07 - set one environment
15:10 - variable and then it will
15:13 - compile without
15:15 - [Music]
15:18 - any
15:21 - problem so you need to write export LD
15:26 - Dash Library Dash
15:30 - path this Dash is underscore keep in
15:33 - mind is equal
15:36 - to/ USR SL looc SL Library so this is
15:43 - the environment variable you need to set
15:47 - in order to run this
15:51 - executable file so I
15:55 - will paste it here and just press enter
15:58 - and and my environment variable is set
16:01 - and then once again I will execute I
16:05 - executeable
16:07 - file
16:08 - enter and yes it gives me the desired
16:19 - result one more thing I want to share
16:22 - with you is this export LD Library Das
16:27 - paath is equal to use
16:29 - user SL local lib is a temporary setting
16:34 - of environment variable if you want to
16:38 - set
16:41 - permanent environment variable you need
16:45 - to edit
16:48 - your bash RC
16:51 - file which also I have shown you
16:57 - in my blog log so for that what you need
17:01 - to
17:03 - do
17:05 - is
17:10 - to execute this
17:13 - gedit
17:16 - slash do bashrc command and it will open
17:23 - your bash RC file and at the bottom of
17:27 - your Bash RC file you need
17:30 - to write export LD Library path is equal
17:34 - to user local
17:37 - lib and where after that you save that
17:41 - bash RC file and execute this
17:45 - command
17:47 - Source till sl.
17:51 - bashrc so it will set your environment
17:54 - variable
17:57 - permanently so so once again when you
17:59 - open a new terminal and you want to
18:02 - execute
18:04 - this log for CPP
18:07 - exe it will not show this error
18:13 - again okay so I hope you have learned
18:16 - something new this time about lock for
18:20 - CPP and I hope you will rate comment and
18:25 - subscribe and keep watching these
18:27 - videos thanks for
18:30 - now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how you can download install and run sample program from log for CPP so what is lock for CPP lock for CPP is a C++ library from which you can prepare logging files and sometimes it's really good and essential for your application to have lock for CPP so let's get started and First Step you need to do is go to log for cp. source.net there you can find information about log for CPP and what are the cap capabilities and how you can download and install lock for CPP so first step is to download the LI Library so go to downloads and click download page and you will be directed to the source Forge repository and you can download the latest zip file for log for CPP so click download and download and your system there is uh something I want to say that I will install and compile this log for CPP on my UB 2 12.10 operating system so all the step will be specific to open to Linux and you can take a tip from these instruction and Implement on your own operating system also different operating system so what you need to do is to download this tar file and extract it to the folder of your choice so I have extracted this log for C CPP in my home folder of my Linux operating system okay now we once again go to the log for CPP website of log for CPP source.net and here it says the step steps to configure and make and make install for the untu sorry for the C log for C++ Library so I have followed these steps and from my experience what I have faced and what experience I have with lock C for CPP I have written this documentation in my blog my blog name is uh www. programming knowledge blog. blogs spot. day or what com and here when you go to the labels just click log for CPP this one and it will open these this procedure what procedure you need to follow in order to install and run your first sample program from log for CPP so let's get started from the first step which is going to the directory of log for CPP and we will open our terminal and here we will go to the directory which is CD log for CPP because it's in my home directory and then type second step is to configure these this Library so I will write dot slash slash. configure and press enter and it will start configuring this file into your system while it's configuring let's see what next we need to do so I will come to my blog entry after configuring you need to make this file and then make check and make install Okay so the configuration is done and now the third step is to make the program so once again in the terminal type make and press enter and it will start making your program so uh now your make is also done so next step is to perform make check so I will write pseudo make check and press enter it will ask for my password and press enter and and it will start checking for your make so our make check is also performed successfully if our make check is performed successfully you can see this all 10 test passed the next step is to install so write sudo make install and press enter and it will install lock for cpv file into your system and this is complete also so our first stage of of configuring and making lock for CPP file is complete now what we will do is we will make a sample program which is given on the lock for CPP website and then we will compile and run that program so what I will do first is I will go into my home folder and I will make a document blank document and I will name it as log for CPP Dot CPP file and enter so this will create a CPP file for me and then I will open this file and it must be blank and what I will do is I will go to log for CPP website yeah and at the bottom they have given a sample exit example for log for CPP so we will try to compile and run this example I will just copy this simple example and copy and paste and to my blank log for CPP file which I have made recently okay and then I will save it my file is saved now and then once again I will go to my terminal and I will perform CD because my log for CPP file is my in my home folder so I will perform the other step from here I will clear this screen and I will go to my blog entry here on www. programming knowledge blog. Blogspot doday and here I have written the compilation method and yeah okay so to compile this log for CPP file or s simple example you need to copy this command from there from my blog or I will just show you what to write compile this log for CPP and paste it here so to compile this program you need to write g++ space minus GS T ABS plusus w space minus I headers space your log for CPP file name space O your log for CPP executable file names which you want to produce and then space l log for CPP space L PT read okay and then I will press enter to compile this CPP file and yes it's compiled successfully but first of all I will show you this is the executable file my program has generated by compiling this command g++ command which you can copy it from my blog and now we will execute our executable file which is generated and when you execute this executable file it will show an error which shows that your or error while loading share shared Library lib log for CPP doso do5 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory this error will come this error you can eliminate by this line which is simply you need to set one environment variable and then it will compile without any problem so you need to write export LD Dash Library Dash path this Dash is underscore keep in mind is equal to/ USR SL looc SL Library so this is the environment variable you need to set in order to run this executable file so I will paste it here and just press enter and and my environment variable is set and then once again I will execute I executeable file enter and yes it gives me the desired result one more thing I want to share with you is this export LD Library Das paath is equal to use user SL local lib is a temporary setting of environment variable if you want to set permanent environment variable you need to edit your bash RC file which also I have shown you in my blog log so for that what you need to do is to execute this gedit slash do bashrc command and it will open your bash RC file and at the bottom of your Bash RC file you need to write export LD Library path is equal to user local lib and where after that you save that bash RC file and execute this command Source till sl. bashrc so it will set your environment variable permanently so so once again when you open a new terminal and you want to execute this log for CPP exe it will not show this error again okay so I hope you have learned something new this time about lock for CPP and I hope you will rate comment and subscribe and keep watching these videos thanks for now
