With timestamps:

00:01 - okay so welcome back guys to the another
00:03 - video of the Java tutorial Series so
00:05 - today we are we are starting with our
00:07 - very first concept of the
00:08 - object-oriented programming languages
00:11 - that is objects and classes so in this
00:14 - video we will be covering objects and
00:15 - classes
00:16 - so let's just get started so first of
00:20 - all I'm covering objects then I will
00:22 - cover uh class okay
00:26 - so what is object an object is an entity
00:28 - that hasn't State a behavior is known as
00:31 - object for example chair bike marker pen
00:34 - everything you see surrounding you is an
00:36 - object in a real world entity right it
00:39 - can be physical or theological okay the
00:42 - example of an intangible object is a
00:44 - banking system that we have done project
00:46 - on it as if you have watched or
00:49 - following the series okay so what are
00:52 - the characteristics of the object a
00:54 - state a state represent represents the
00:56 - data of an object and the behavior
00:58 - Behavior represents the behavior of an
01:01 - uh object such as deposit withdraw this
01:04 - is related to the banking application
01:06 - that project we have done uh in our
01:08 - previous videos okay and identity it is
01:11 - used internally by the jvm to identify
01:14 - each object uniquely so this is just
01:17 - identity is the just a jvm part that it
01:19 - handles to identify the each object uh
01:22 - uniquely in Java okay
01:24 - uh so first we will see the theoretical
01:28 - part of the object in the class then we
01:30 - will get into get into our IDE and see
01:33 - how class and objects are declared
01:36 - inside the code okay so what is the
01:38 - class a class is a group of objects a
01:41 - Fields methods Constructors blocks or
01:44 - nested classes and interfaces these all
01:47 - kinds of methods Constructors that you
01:49 - wrote in uh in Java you put it inside a
01:52 - class and a class holds all these fields
01:55 - okay and a class it is a template or a
01:59 - blueprint from which objects are created
02:01 - and it is a logical entity and it can it
02:04 - can't be physical okay so I will explain
02:06 - you one by one what what I have to uh
02:10 - speak right now okay so let me just open
02:12 - my IDE
02:18 - a by the way guys if you are enjoying
02:20 - this series so please like share and
02:22 - subscribe to the channel also okay
02:25 - okay
02:26 - wait hey this is the code of the project
02:30 - which you have which we have done
02:32 - previously okay if you have not watched
02:34 - this video go and watch it
02:36 - okay so here let me just create a new
02:40 - Java class name
02:43 - um what should I name this
02:45 - classes
02:48 - and
02:51 - objects okay
02:54 - okay let me just increase the font size
02:56 - and let me just get my main method
03:01 - okay so here you can see one one class
03:05 - is declared okay public class classes
03:08 - and objects okay so as I have taught you
03:11 - over here you know in my notes okay it
03:14 - holds methods Constructors blocks and
03:17 - nested classes so right now this class
03:20 - is holding one main method main is a
03:24 - method method name okay and what what
03:25 - here here we have written it is holding
03:28 - method Constructor okay class is nothing
03:30 - but the
03:31 - one place where you in in which you have
03:34 - writing methods all those uh interfaces
03:37 - and code okay and here I can do whatever
03:42 - I want like just I will print one
03:45 - statement
03:48 - and low
03:49 - world and if I click here
03:54 - okay so it it will get that class and it
03:58 - will run that class okay just wait
04:02 - let me run this class
04:06 - okay so here you can see hello world is
04:09 - getting printed on the console what
04:10 - internally Java does is our class is
04:13 - this classes and objects okay dot Java
04:17 - this this is our file and whenever I
04:20 - click on the Run button it converts that
04:22 - dot Java file this file into a DOT class
04:25 - file the dot class file is then again
04:27 - used by the jvm and it uh it is
04:31 - converted uh into the byte code and
04:33 - which is the machine understandable code
04:35 - and our code get executed in the console
04:37 - okay so this is the behind the scene how
04:40 - this works okay and now I will give you
04:44 - an example of the object also so that
04:47 - you can understand clearly uh instead of
04:50 - writing here I will wait
04:52 - okay forgot let me just create one new
04:55 - class for you so that you can understand
04:57 - clearly
05:00 - okay uh so this this is our class and
05:05 - here
05:06 - wait let me just create one method okay
05:10 - uh
05:12 - print
05:15 - and this method is better than accepting
05:17 - anything and this method is simply
05:19 - printing
05:23 - hello world message on the screen
05:26 - okay so I have created another class
05:29 - name objects and one method is there
05:31 - inside this class name print and this
05:34 - method is doing nothing just simply
05:35 - printing the hello world on the screen
05:36 - okay so let me just clear it out uh
05:39 - comment it out
05:40 - and how to create an object okay so this
05:43 - is one part uh listen carefully so to
05:47 - create an object you have to write the
05:49 - class name
05:51 - oops sorry objects and then you have to
05:55 - write
05:56 - the what name you are giving to an
05:59 - object okay so name can be anything like
06:02 - this anything you want you name you name
06:05 - that object okay so I will name this as
06:08 - obj1 because this is my first object so
06:12 - you can write anything okay uh so after
06:14 - that here you can see we we have also
06:16 - created uh this object during our
06:18 - project itself okay after that you have
06:22 - to write new then again the class name
06:25 - and this okay so you'll be wondering you
06:28 - know why I have not passed over
06:30 - something over here because it if you
06:32 - are following the series you you can see
06:33 - we have passed something over here
06:35 - that's because our we have created one
06:37 - Constructor of this class we will cover
06:39 - in depth quarter look at the Constructor
06:41 - in our upcoming videos also okay so now
06:43 - for till now you just understand how to
06:46 - create an object okay so this is where
06:48 - we just have to write the class name the
06:50 - object name and the new keyword is used
06:52 - to memory memory allocation of that
06:54 - object okay and after that using that
06:57 - object I can call all those methods and
06:59 - construct trade which are written inside
07:00 - this class okay so I will write obj1
07:04 - dot Sprint okay so here you can see and
07:09 - I will just click on this
07:12 - run button and here you can see again
07:16 - hello world is getting printed on the
07:17 - console I have con I have commented out
07:20 - this uh let me just clearly it again so
07:24 - that you guys can understand clearly
07:26 - okay hello well it's printed on the
07:28 - console how it is working internally
07:30 - just uh look at here one object is
07:32 - objects object is the class name we
07:35 - create an object object one we use the
07:36 - new keyword to uh allocate the memory of
07:38 - the to our object and using that object
07:41 - we have called one print method of that
07:44 - class okay one print method is here and
07:47 - uh the egg call get executed uh call
07:51 - gets over here wired print is called and
07:54 - executed and inside this we have written
07:57 - one South print statement
07:59 - that is hello world and this hello world
08:01 - is getting printed on the console the
08:03 - program execution comes here and comes
08:06 - here and Main methods gets over and our
08:08 - program gets terminated
08:10 - okay so this is pretty much about the
08:12 - classes and objects in Java so I hope
08:15 - you guys have get got some idea of the
08:16 - about the classes and objects in Java so
08:19 - in our upcoming videos we will cover uh
08:22 - I guess methods uh which is the next
08:24 - part of the object oriented programming
08:26 - language so thank you guys for watching
08:27 - this video

okay so welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so today we are we are starting with our very first concept of the objectoriented programming languages that is objects and
