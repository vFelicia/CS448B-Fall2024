00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install Ubuntu 16.4 on VMware virtual
00:09 - machine
00:09 - I have VMware Player installed but this
00:13 - procedure can be used for VMware
00:16 - Workstation also so first of all
00:19 - hopefully you already have installed a
00:22 - VMware virtual machine I as I said I
00:26 - already have VMware Player but hopefully
00:30 - you already have a VMware Player or
00:33 - workstation right now the first step
00:37 - here is to download the ISO file for
00:40 - Ubuntu so just search for one - and the
00:42 - first website hopefully which will
00:44 - appear here will be from ubuntu.com so
00:48 - just click on this URL and then we are
00:53 - going to go to download and in the
00:58 - download click Ubuntu desktop
01:01 - I am the desktop you can see two
01:05 - versions one is ubuntu 16.04 LTS LTS
01:11 - stands for long-term service version
01:14 - which will be supported for a longer
01:16 - time and other is 16.0 which will be
01:21 - supported for nine months you can see
01:24 - every nine months Ubuntu releases a new
01:28 - version so I will suggest you to
01:30 - download that this version which says
01:32 - LTS and click on this download button
01:35 - which will lead you to this page here if
01:39 - you want you can you know pay some
01:42 - donation to Ubuntu in order to download
01:45 - this or otherwise you can just you know
01:48 - make these progress bar to zero and then
01:52 - click download Ubuntu desktop okay so
01:56 - what I have done is I have already
01:58 - downloaded this ISO file because it's
02:01 - relatively big file which is 1.4 GB so I
02:05 - have already downloaded this file and
02:07 - after downloading it is going to look
02:10 - like this so this will
02:13 - be something like this Ubuntu 16.4
02:16 - desktop amd64 dot iso file ok once this
02:22 - file is downloaded just open your VMware
02:25 - virtual machine and in here we are going
02:28 - to create a new virtual machine right so
02:31 - click home here and then just click
02:35 - create a new virtual machine and then
02:41 - the next step will be the installation
02:46 - wizard we will just select I will
02:49 - install operating system later and then
02:52 - click Next and we want to install Linux
02:55 - and from here you need to choose Ubuntu
02:59 - 64-bit so just choose Ubuntu 64-bit and
03:04 - then click Next and this will be the
03:07 - name of your virtual machine you can see
03:10 - I already have some virtual machine
03:12 - installed including Ruben too so I will
03:16 - name it as open to 64-bit too but in
03:20 - your case you can leave it as default ok
03:22 - and then click it next and here just
03:27 - leave everything as default this will be
03:29 - the maximum size needed for Ubuntu so
03:34 - just leave it as default and then click
03:36 - Next and then click finish
03:39 - once you click finish you will be able
03:42 - to see your virtual machine created here
03:44 - but still you are not ready to start
03:48 - your virtual machine because we haven't
03:49 - provided any path to the virtual machine
03:52 - so select your virtual machine which you
03:55 - have created and then click Add it
03:58 - virtual machine settings and in here you
04:02 - can provide different settings to your
04:05 - virtual machine first is the memory by
04:08 - default 1gb memory is set but we can
04:12 - increase it to for example for 4 GB
04:15 - depending upon the you know memory
04:18 - available in your computer second is the
04:22 - processors by default a VMware will
04:27 - locate one processor for your virtual
04:29 - machine which you can increase for
04:32 - example I want to use two processor or
04:35 - two cores for my machine right this is
04:38 - the hard disk I do not want to change
04:40 - this 20 GB but if you want you can
04:44 - change it now the next is the cd/dvd and
04:49 - from here you can give the path of your
04:52 - ISO file so just select CV CD / DVD SATA
04:57 - and then choose this option that says
05:00 - use ISO image file and then browse for
05:05 - the file so we will browse for this ISO
05:09 - file which we have downloaded so I will
05:11 - just copy the path and paste it here and
05:13 - then just select this ISO file and click
05:17 - open ok I will minimize this and once
05:21 - you are done with the path you know
05:26 - selection then you can click OK and now
05:29 - we can just play our virtual machine
05:32 - which will start the installation so
05:34 - select your virtual machine which you
05:36 - have created and then click this button
05:39 - which says play virtual machine is going
05:42 - to start the installation for ubuntu
05:45 - 16.04
05:46 - [Music]
05:48 - so you can see the installation has been
05:52 - started first of all you will be able to
05:55 - see this kind of screen and then you
05:58 - will be able to see that installation
06:00 - wizard for ubuntu so in the next step
06:05 - you will be able to see this kind of
06:07 - interface which say is try of 1 2 and
06:11 - install Ubuntu and on the left hand side
06:14 - you can select the language in which you
06:15 - want to install ubuntu so for now I want
06:19 - to choose English as the installation
06:21 - language and I will just click this
06:24 - button which says install ubuntu now in
06:28 - the next step
06:29 - it says prepare to install ubuntu in
06:32 - this case you just need to check both
06:35 - the option I prefer to choose both the
06:37 - option which says download updates while
06:39 - installing Ubuntu
06:40 - I install third-party software for
06:43 - graphics right so I will prefer to check
06:45 - both the option and click continue and
06:47 - in the next step it says choose the
06:50 - installation type this computer
06:53 - currently has no a detected operating
06:55 - system what we do like to do so this
06:59 - option which is by default selected is
07:01 - okay some people may think that it is
07:04 - dis how it will work
07:07 - it will not erase your original host
07:10 - operating system this is just an option
07:14 - right so just leave it as it is this can
07:17 - install Ubuntu checked right and then
07:21 - click install now and then click
07:24 - continue and here you just need to
07:26 - choose the region in which you are
07:29 - living my region is automatically
07:31 - selected hopefully your region will also
07:34 - be automatically selected so you just
07:36 - need to click Next in here in the next
07:39 - step you can choose the desktop or
07:41 - keyboard layout for you so as I have a
07:45 - German keyboard layout I can choose from
07:48 - here in case you have any other language
07:51 - keyboard layout you can choose your
07:53 - preferred keyboard layout or if you're
07:56 - not sure just leave it as default and
07:58 - then click continue
08:01 - okay now in the next step you will be
08:04 - asked your give your username and
08:08 - computer name for your Ubuntu
08:10 - installation so I will give the user
08:13 - names I will give code bind and the
08:18 - computer name I will just leave it as
08:20 - code bind itself the same name as the
08:24 - name of the computer right and then you
08:29 - need to give the password here just give
08:31 - any password which you whichever you
08:33 - like and repeat your password again and
08:38 - then click continue and now the
08:41 - installation for Ubuntu operating system
08:45 - on VMware has been started it will take
08:48 - around 10 to 15 minutes to complete the
08:53 - installation
08:54 - in some cases it can take lesser time
08:57 - also and just wait for this progress bar
09:00 - to go to 100% and then I will pause the
09:05 - video for now bit because it can take a
09:08 - little bit longer and once this step is
09:11 - complete I'm going to you know continue
09:14 - with the video so now the installation
09:16 - for Ubuntu 16-4 point for operating
09:20 - system on my VMware Player is complete
09:22 - and it says distillation complete you
09:25 - need to restart your computer so you can
09:27 - just press restart Now button which is
09:30 - going to essentially restart you're open

09:51 - restarted and now you just need to give
09:54 - the password you have provided at the
09:56 - time of installation and press ENTER and
09:58 - hopefully you will be able to see the
10:02 - icons on the left hand bar and hopefully
10:07 - you will be able to you know run your
10:09 - open to as a virtual machine on the
10:13 - VMware Player okay so just wait for a
10:16 - few seconds and on the left hand side
10:20 - this bar will appear automatically so
10:23 - here it is so this bar is appearing so
10:27 - now when you expand so installation is
