With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this video we are gonna continue
00:02 - with our back end
00:03 - and then and today we are gonna make an
00:06 - api to get the list of
00:08 - all the sellers okay so that we can show
00:11 - it to the user and then the user will
00:13 - select
00:14 - one his favorite seller and then we will
00:18 - show all the products that that seller
00:21 - has
00:21 - okay so let's get started with it so
00:24 - inside
00:26 - let's go inside the seller table okay so
00:29 - over here i'll create a
00:30 - function to get the list of all the
00:32 - sellers
00:34 - okay so let's get started
00:39 - method to return the list of
00:42 - sellers so i can close this for now
00:48 - okay so let's start so it's
00:52 - public function
00:56 - all sellers
01:02 - okay then over here we will have a
01:04 - instance of our database
01:07 - then our sql query is gonna be
01:11 - select and let's see what all datas are
01:14 - what all
01:14 - key value pairs are needed so for that
01:17 - i'll open
01:18 - my uh database so as to see what all
01:21 - values we actually have at the moment
01:24 - okay so i don't know
01:28 - how its theme got changed
01:36 - okay so now it looks better so i'll go
01:39 - in my better wise table inside
01:41 - seller i think uh by just
01:45 - giving the name image and
01:48 - the address would be enough okay so
01:51 - what i am planning to do is is to show a
01:54 - list of sellers and then
01:58 - with the basic details and from there
02:00 - user can select any of the seller and
02:02 - then we will be displaying the
02:03 - products for which we have already
02:05 - designed the screen
02:07 - so i think the id name
02:10 - image and address would do so we will
02:13 - get only these things
02:16 - id name image
02:20 - address id name uh image address
02:23 - we need to keep a close look on the
02:26 - spellings if we
02:27 - mess up the spellings everything is
02:30 - gonna go haywire so
02:31 - we will so the query is select id name
02:35 - image address from
02:39 - this table okay so this is our very
02:43 - basic query
02:44 - now let's run it so it is the result
02:50 - database query
02:55 - sql and once we run this we will get a
02:58 - result with all the tables so we will
03:00 - then fetch the
03:02 - fetch all the rows and for that in our
03:04 - database class we already created a
03:06 - function that is called
03:08 - fetch array so what we are going to do
03:11 - over here is
03:12 - simply return
03:16 - database fetch array and it takes
03:20 - our result instance okay so now what it
03:23 - will do is it will
03:24 - fetch all the columns
03:27 - and then return it as an array and that
03:30 - will
03:30 - in turn be returned by this function
03:33 - okay so now let's create an
03:35 - api to call this function so inside api
03:39 - i am gonna create a new folder that will
03:41 - be
03:42 - global or general so i'll call it
03:44 - general and inside
03:46 - this i'll create a new file that is
03:48 - sellers
03:49 - i'm sorry it needs to be sellers.php
03:53 - so i'm gonna rename it sellers.php
04:00 - now it is gonna be like this with slight
04:02 - changes means all the apis are
04:04 - almost the same we have very slight
04:07 - changes here and there
04:09 - so i'll copy this paste it over here
04:12 - this is gonna be get because we are
04:14 - fetching the details from the
04:16 - database and not adding anything or
04:19 - performing any query on the database
04:21 - so the most suitable type of request is
04:24 - gonna be
04:24 - the get request and the table
04:28 - here being used is the seller table so
04:31 - over here
04:31 - instead of getting the product table i'm
04:35 - gonna get the seller table
04:37 - okay so it is just a seller
04:41 - now after this we have this condition to
04:44 - check if it is
04:46 - of the mentioned type or not so let's
04:49 - do that over here it is gonna be get
04:52 - okay and then if it is not we have else
04:57 - else we return this okay
05:01 - now after this we can simply call that
05:04 - function and get the list
05:05 - so i'm gonna write uh echo
05:12 - json encode array
05:17 - success one
05:22 - so this is gonna be sellers
05:27 - and it is seller which is the
05:30 - object of this class here's seller
05:34 - and then the function name okay so
05:38 - that is all sellers so
05:42 - i write it over here
05:46 - and this is done so what basically
05:49 - happened over here was that we checked
05:50 - if it is a get request
05:52 - if it is a get request then we give the
05:54 - output as
05:55 - success is one and as in the sellers
05:59 - we get the list of all the sellers and
06:01 - directly return it
06:02 - okay so the api is ready now let's try
06:04 - running it
06:05 - so for that i'll open my postman okay so
06:08 - this is the
06:10 - address of our api so i'm gonna simply
06:14 - paste it and change the
06:16 - last part so inside api we are inside a
06:19 - folder called
06:20 - gen so it is gonna be gen and then we
06:22 - are
06:23 - in the file sellers so i'm gonna write
06:26 - sellers
06:27 - okay so now let's hit send and see
06:32 - and we did get the list a list of all
06:34 - the sellers so
06:36 - right now we only have one seller now
06:38 - let's try creating another seller
06:41 - okay so
06:45 - instead of rishabh kumar
06:49 - it is gonna be ayush
06:56 - singh and it can be ayush and the
06:59 - password instead of quartey can be one
07:01 - two three four five six
07:02 - although it is not suggested okay
07:05 - and the address can be the same
07:07 - description can be the same
07:09 - and then let's register it
07:13 - okay so
07:16 - seller registered and now if we get the
07:19 - list of all the sellers then we
07:21 - are getting two sellers first one is
07:22 - rishabh kumar and the
07:24 - second one is singh so with this the
07:28 - the api is complete we have an api to
07:31 - get the list of all the sellers
07:34 - okay which we can use in the screen to
07:36 - display the list of the sellers for the
07:38 - user to choose
07:39 - okay so this was for the video thank you
