With timestamps:

00:00 - now in this video we'll be learning
00:02 - about how we can get the input from the
00:04 - user okay so basically we will see uh
00:08 - with the many examples like suppose I
00:10 - will ask the user to enter his name so
00:12 - at that time you just should be able to
00:14 - enter his name and all those things okay
00:17 - so basically we will use the read
00:20 - command or you can yeah read command you
00:22 - can say all the what you can say like
00:27 - you did keyword is used to take input
00:30 - from the user in the Shell scripting
00:34 - okay so actually I have already opened
00:35 - up the terminal here uh vs code sorry
00:39 - and I will just create a new file here
00:41 - uh zero three uh read input dot sh
00:47 - okay so I will just use this hashtag
00:52 - pin bash okay I'll just give it the name
00:57 - of this tutorial that is bead input
01:02 - create input from user okay so first of
01:07 - all we will see the basic scenario like
01:09 - suppose I enter here uh Echo enter your
01:14 - name piece
01:15 - okay
01:17 - so here I will read the name and here
01:21 - you you will see the divs will be the
01:23 - name of the variable okay in which you
01:27 - want to store this value okay and next
01:30 - here I will print the variable like your
01:34 - name else
01:38 - uh dollar name okay
01:42 - Ctrl s to save and
01:46 - I want to run from here
01:50 - but here from here I will need to give
01:51 - permission but so it's better to run
01:54 - from here okay so here it is asking for
01:57 - me to enter my name so I will enter
02:00 - ayush okay why it's not working
02:05 - oh my God
02:09 - let me just Ctrl C uh
02:13 - let me use the term information is far
02:15 - better than this okay so we need to just
02:18 - give the permission
02:20 - go to that file that is 0 3
02:23 - we are done dot slash zero three dot sh
02:28 - okay sorry dot slash zero three dot sh
02:32 - and enter your name please I use so you
02:36 - can see the your name is IOS okay
02:40 - so in this way we can uh take the input
02:42 - from the user and also there are many
02:45 - use cases of this Reader Command okay so
02:48 - we will learn it one by one okay so uh
02:51 - let's start with the first one like we
02:54 - can use many options like read hyphen p
02:57 - okay so next moving forward I will just
03:01 - uh here I will do a read hyphen p is
03:05 - used for the prompt so here I will
03:08 - prompt enter
03:10 - your
03:11 - uh h
03:14 - okay
03:16 - so here you can just give the name of
03:19 - the variable which you want to provide
03:21 - you can just give it as is
03:24 - okay and next I will just use this Eco
03:28 - command or eco
03:30 - keyword to print the value your name
03:33 - sorry UA this what dollar is
03:38 - okay control s to save clear the screen
03:42 - again on the script your name my name is
03:45 - ayush guys
03:46 - here is I will enter 20 here you can see
03:50 - your age is 20. so what is the
03:53 - difference between this and above and
03:56 - this one read me so what is happening
03:59 - here we are using one extra line for
04:01 - echoing that particular line but to you
04:04 - using hyphen P option you can write your
04:07 - variable as well whatever you want to
04:09 - prompt to the user you can write those
04:11 - all things in a one single line so now
04:15 - let me just comment on these things and
04:17 - I will again run the
04:19 - come on so that will be easy for you to
04:22 - understand
04:23 - so here it is asking me for interview
04:26 - yes so here you can see I have just used
04:28 - this single line and it was asking me to
04:31 - enter the
04:32 - uh whatever the A's and all those things
04:35 - so don't be confused it was by mistake
04:38 - 204 I'm not that much old okay
04:41 - so uh in this way you can uh use this
04:45 - hyphen P option also there is many
04:47 - amazing option like uh if I will
04:50 - uncomment this and I will just comment
04:53 - out these things and if in case you
04:56 - don't provide the variable name so at
04:59 - that time you can use this reply
05:04 - okay you can use this one
05:08 - to
05:10 - like you can use this one like this okay
05:12 - if you don't provide the name of the
05:14 - variable then it will store it into this
05:17 - deep plan so I will just again run up
05:20 - this particular script and I will write
05:22 - the name as ayush and here you can see I
05:25 - should name it ayush without any use of
05:27 - variable okay but that is not a very
05:30 - good practice to use but yeah it is
05:33 - always uh like advice to use the
05:36 - variables okay
05:38 - so I will give it the name here as name
05:40 - and the same as it is
05:42 - the dollar name okay
05:46 - taller name okay we are done you are
05:49 - good to go no there is also some amazing
05:51 - things you should know about like
05:53 - suppose I am asking the user to enter
05:56 - some kind of confidential information I
05:58 - will just comment out these things
06:00 - uh read hyphen p and username
06:06 - okay
06:09 - suppose you're asking for the user I
06:12 - will just create a variable username
06:17 - and you can also ask for password read
06:21 - hyphen SP
06:23 - and here you will ask for the password
06:26 - so obviously you don't want to reveal
06:29 - your password okay with everyone so The
06:32 - Hyphen s provides that functionality you
06:34 - will see right now
06:35 - so I will just Echo those two variables
06:39 - so here I will write like this your not
06:42 - you just use username
06:46 - and a dollar user name
06:51 - username okay yeah we're good to go now
06:53 - and just use the password
06:56 - okay dollar password okay controllers to
07:02 - save let me just clear the screen again
07:04 - this one username my username is uh
07:08 - this one you can follow me on Instagram
07:10 - I know I'm promoting and for password
07:14 - you can use
07:16 - it's
07:18 - easy to crack
07:21 - okay so here you can see the username is
07:24 - this one and password is this one but
07:27 - you I hope uh you just
07:32 - uh what we can say
07:36 - notice like the when I was typing the uh
07:39 - password it was not visible okay I will
07:42 - use one more Eco for the blank space
07:44 - okay again I will run the script so that
07:47 - could be easy to understand so I will
07:50 - use username I use and the password is
07:52 - something in the C I am typing but
07:54 - nothing is playing on the screen and
07:56 - here you can see now username is iusion
07:59 - password is this whatever written okay
08:03 - so this is the
08:05 - thing
08:07 - okay so I hope you got to learn about
08:10 - like how you can take input from the
08:12 - user okay so now thank you for watching
