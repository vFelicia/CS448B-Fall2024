00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - teach you about difference between
00:06 - method hiding which we have seen in the
00:09 - last to last video and method overriding
00:12 - which we have seen in the last video
00:14 - when we have learned
00:16 - polymorphism so suppose I have a base
00:19 - class called
00:20 - Drawing so it's just a a simple base
00:24 - class which is like this public class uh
00:28 - drawing and it has one method called
00:31 - Draw and what what this method is doing
00:35 - it's it's printing just a message and
00:38 - this message says this is just a generic
00:42 - drawing
00:43 - class for example okay now I want to
00:48 - derive a child class from this Base
00:51 - Class so what I will do is I will just
00:56 - derived a child class called line for
00:59 - example
01:02 - and I will derive from this Base Class
01:07 - drawing and this also has uh this draw
01:11 - method and this time I will say the
01:15 - message that this is
01:18 - a line okay so this we have seen in the
01:23 - last video when we want to
01:25 - override uh
01:28 - this base class draw method from a
01:32 - derived class method we add a
01:36 - keyword virtual in the base class
01:41 - and override in the derived class so
01:45 - what this will do is this virtual
01:48 - keyword says the base class that
01:52 - whenever we are going to uh declare uh
01:56 - derived class and we want to have its
01:59 - own uh draw method we can
02:01 - override this same
02:04 - method by using this virtual and using
02:07 - this override
02:09 - keyword and now let's go to uh the main
02:15 - method and let's call and let's create
02:18 - the instance of this drawing class so I
02:20 - will just copy this drawing class and I
02:24 - will just create the instant
02:28 - obj is equal to
02:31 - new and let's
02:33 - create the instance of this line
02:38 - class so line
02:45 - okay so what this is going to do is
02:49 - let's call the draw method from here obj
02:54 - do draw okay so what this will do is
03:00 - let's try and run the program and what's
03:03 - it going to do is it will print this is
03:06 - a line because we have
03:09 - overridden our Base Class method draw by
03:13 - our derived class method right so it
03:17 - will whenever
03:19 - you declare a base class reference which
03:23 - points to the derived class uh object
03:28 - then it will call the derive class
03:31 - method okay now let's uh try to change
03:36 - or make it method hiding so instead of
03:40 - this
03:41 - override keyword we will write new so
03:45 - this we have seen in the last to last
03:47 - video that whenever we use this new
03:50 - keyword with our derived class your
03:55 - drive class method
03:57 - will hide your Base Class method right
04:03 - but whenever we run the
04:06 - program you see the message is this is
04:09 - just a generic drawing
04:12 - class so whenever you use this method
04:16 - hiding using this new
04:19 - keyword and you will declare the
04:22 - reference variable pointing to the
04:25 - derived class it will in it will
04:28 - indicate to The Base Class okay and
04:31 - whenever you use method overriding using
04:35 - override keyword it'll override your
04:38 - base class method and it will point to
04:42 - this method derived class method so this
04:46 - is the difference between overriding and
04:48 - Method hiding method hiding always point
04:52 - to the base class if you have a base
04:55 - class object right and Method overriding
04:58 - always
05:00 - fetch you the overridden method which is
05:06 - this is a line so I hope you have
05:08 - understood the basic difference between
05:10 - method hiding and Method
05:13 - overriding and I hope you have enjoyed
05:15 - this video please wrate comment and

hello guys in this video I'm going to teach you about difference between method hiding which we have seen in the last to last video and method overriding which we have seen in the last video when we have learned polymorphism so suppose I have a base class called Drawing so it's just a a simple base class which is like this public class uh drawing and it has one method called Draw and what what this method is doing it's it's printing just a message and this message says this is just a generic drawing class for example okay now I want to derive a child class from this Base Class so what I will do is I will just derived a child class called line for example and I will derive from this Base Class drawing and this also has uh this draw method and this time I will say the message that this is a line okay so this we have seen in the last video when we want to override uh this base class draw method from a derived class method we add a keyword virtual in the base class and override in the derived class so what this will do is this virtual keyword says the base class that whenever we are going to uh declare uh derived class and we want to have its own uh draw method we can override this same method by using this virtual and using this override keyword and now let's go to uh the main method and let's call and let's create the instance of this drawing class so I will just copy this drawing class and I will just create the instant obj is equal to new and let's create the instance of this line class so line okay so what this is going to do is let's call the draw method from here obj do draw okay so what this will do is let's try and run the program and what's it going to do is it will print this is a line because we have overridden our Base Class method draw by our derived class method right so it will whenever you declare a base class reference which points to the derived class uh object then it will call the derive class method okay now let's uh try to change or make it method hiding so instead of this override keyword we will write new so this we have seen in the last to last video that whenever we use this new keyword with our derived class your drive class method will hide your Base Class method right but whenever we run the program you see the message is this is just a generic drawing class so whenever you use this method hiding using this new keyword and you will declare the reference variable pointing to the derived class it will in it will indicate to The Base Class okay and whenever you use method overriding using override keyword it'll override your base class method and it will point to this method derived class method so this is the difference between overriding and Method hiding method hiding always point to the base class if you have a base class object right and Method overriding always fetch you the overridden method which is this is a line so I hope you have understood the basic difference between method hiding and Method overriding and I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
