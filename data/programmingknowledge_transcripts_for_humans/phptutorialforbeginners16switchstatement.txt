00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use switch cases in your
00:05 - PHP programming switch cases is also one
00:09 - of the conditional statement in
00:12 - PHP and generally you can use switch
00:16 - cases if you have multiple conditions to
00:19 - check so let's see how we can use switch
00:23 - cases so for example I have for example
00:27 - a variable
00:31 - called number and I initialize this
00:36 - value is equal to one and I want to
00:39 - check whether uh this whether the value
00:44 - of this number is uh one or not or
00:49 - whatever okay so I can use it using I
00:53 - can use switch cases to evaluate that
00:56 - for example I can write
01:00 - switch and then it should be switch like
01:05 - this with a keyword switch and then it
01:10 - ends like this so I already told you
01:14 - that whenever you want to evaluate
01:16 - different condition or more than one
01:18 - condition you can use switch cases
01:21 - so we have case in switch like this and
01:27 - we can evaluate this case but first of
01:30 - all switch cases takes an argument
01:34 - whatever you want to evaluate first so
01:37 - for example I want to evaluate the value
01:40 - of number and on the basis of this value
01:42 - I want to decide some messages for
01:45 - example so I can do it like this switch
01:49 - case
01:51 - one and this should be colon and then I
01:55 - can just Echo this Echo and I can
02:03 - write number
02:05 - is one okay
02:09 - and then I can just break this switch
02:14 - cases whenever my condition is
02:17 - met I can just write break keyword for
02:20 - that and in the same way I
02:23 - can evaluate multiple conditions for
02:27 - example
02:28 - one 2 3 here I will write
02:34 - [Music]
02:37 - two
02:39 - three and I can just save it and let's
02:44 - see what is the result so I just click
02:48 - this switch.
02:51 - PHP and the result is number is one
02:55 - right so you can check multiple
02:58 - conditions using switch cases so if the
03:01 - number for example I assign this number
03:03 - a value of two then I should see this
03:07 - message right I'll just refresh it and
03:09 - number is two in a similar way number is
03:13 - three save it
03:16 - and number three but for example I
03:21 - provide some random number here
03:25 - 344 then what should
03:27 - happen nothing is happening right now it
03:30 - because no condition is met that means
03:34 - you
03:35 - cannot uh print any result okay
03:40 - so you can just catch this condition
03:44 - which is uh no condition is true by
03:48 - using this
03:51 - keyword
03:53 - default okay and this default says that
03:57 - if none of the above is true this
04:01 - default will be executed right
04:05 - so I can say
04:07 - number
04:09 - not
04:11 - found okay and then let me make it a
04:15 - little bigger B little bit smaller so
04:18 - you can see this and I will save this
04:22 - and now when I run this it says number
04:25 - not found so this default is like else
04:30 - condition when none of the above
04:32 - condition is true then this message will
04:35 - be shown and it's not necessary that
04:39 - this uh switch case will only work with
04:42 - your uh numbers it can work with uh for
04:46 - example uh the string values so for
04:50 - example I want to show some grade of
04:54 - the student okay and for example this
04:58 - grade is
05:01 - capital a
05:04 - right and In Here Also I can just
05:06 - provide capital
05:09 - A and in the same way
05:13 - capital B and capital c and if student
05:19 - get capital A here I will just
05:24 - Echo
05:26 - excellent and if it gets v i just
05:31 - Echo
05:33 - very good and if he gets C I can
05:39 - say
05:44 - need Improvement for example right
05:49 - and in this default condition I can say
05:56 - no
05:58 - grades found
06:00 - right so right now I have assigned grade
06:03 - is equal to a but I need to pass this
06:05 - variable as a condition here and switch
06:08 - cases and then I when I save this you
06:11 - will be able to see excellent because
06:14 - grade is a right now for
06:18 - example I want that if grade is capital
06:22 - A or small a I want to uh print
06:26 - excellent okay so I can achieve this
06:29 - this by writing something like this a
06:34 - small a and capital a case small a case
06:38 - capital A but in between these two cases
06:41 - there will be no break sign so what this
06:45 - break does is it evaluate the condition
06:50 - and for example this condition is true
06:52 - it prints the M message and it breaks
06:55 - from this statement and it goes to the
06:58 - last right but whenever you don't
07:03 - provide any break then your uh condition
07:07 - will go here or the your program will go
07:11 - here it will see that uh the grade
07:15 - is a but not there is no break so it
07:18 - will jump to the second condition and it
07:21 - sees that grade is capital A and it will
07:25 - print this and now it sees that it the
07:28 - grade uh the there has been a break so
07:32 - it will go out of this statement okay so
07:36 - this is also you can say it's a replica
07:40 - of or so
07:44 - if grade is small a or capital A you
07:49 - will print this message right so you can
07:52 - say whenever you don't provide any break
07:56 - statement in between it will jump to the
07:58 - directly to the the next case and this
08:02 - two cases are considered to be an or
08:05 - condition case a or Capital case a is
08:09 - true then this this will be printed in a
08:12 - similar way I can just use this and
08:17 - small
08:18 - B and here small C right save it and I
08:26 - will provide for example small B let's
08:29 - see what
08:32 - happens I can see very good right so if
08:37 - I provide small b or capital B I will
08:41 - see this message but the condition is
08:44 - you should not provide break in between
08:47 - these two cases so in this way you can
08:50 - use switch cases to evaluate multiple
08:54 - conditions in PHP I hope you have

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use switch cases in your PHP programming switch cases is also one of the conditional statement in PHP and generally you can use switch cases if you have multiple conditions to check so let's see how we can use switch cases so for example I have for example a variable called number and I initialize this value is equal to one and I want to check whether uh this whether the value of this number is uh one or not or whatever okay so I can use it using I can use switch cases to evaluate that for example I can write switch and then it should be switch like this with a keyword switch and then it ends like this so I already told you that whenever you want to evaluate different condition or more than one condition you can use switch cases so we have case in switch like this and we can evaluate this case but first of all switch cases takes an argument whatever you want to evaluate first so for example I want to evaluate the value of number and on the basis of this value I want to decide some messages for example so I can do it like this switch case one and this should be colon and then I can just Echo this Echo and I can write number is one okay and then I can just break this switch cases whenever my condition is met I can just write break keyword for that and in the same way I can evaluate multiple conditions for example one 2 3 here I will write two three and I can just save it and let's see what is the result so I just click this switch. PHP and the result is number is one right so you can check multiple conditions using switch cases so if the number for example I assign this number a value of two then I should see this message right I'll just refresh it and number is two in a similar way number is three save it and number three but for example I provide some random number here 344 then what should happen nothing is happening right now it because no condition is met that means you cannot uh print any result okay so you can just catch this condition which is uh no condition is true by using this keyword default okay and this default says that if none of the above is true this default will be executed right so I can say number not found okay and then let me make it a little bigger B little bit smaller so you can see this and I will save this and now when I run this it says number not found so this default is like else condition when none of the above condition is true then this message will be shown and it's not necessary that this uh switch case will only work with your uh numbers it can work with uh for example uh the string values so for example I want to show some grade of the student okay and for example this grade is capital a right and In Here Also I can just provide capital A and in the same way capital B and capital c and if student get capital A here I will just Echo excellent and if it gets v i just Echo very good and if he gets C I can say need Improvement for example right and in this default condition I can say no grades found right so right now I have assigned grade is equal to a but I need to pass this variable as a condition here and switch cases and then I when I save this you will be able to see excellent because grade is a right now for example I want that if grade is capital A or small a I want to uh print excellent okay so I can achieve this this by writing something like this a small a and capital a case small a case capital A but in between these two cases there will be no break sign so what this break does is it evaluate the condition and for example this condition is true it prints the M message and it breaks from this statement and it goes to the last right but whenever you don't provide any break then your uh condition will go here or the your program will go here it will see that uh the grade is a but not there is no break so it will jump to the second condition and it sees that grade is capital A and it will print this and now it sees that it the grade uh the there has been a break so it will go out of this statement okay so this is also you can say it's a replica of or so if grade is small a or capital A you will print this message right so you can say whenever you don't provide any break statement in between it will jump to the directly to the the next case and this two cases are considered to be an or condition case a or Capital case a is true then this this will be printed in a similar way I can just use this and small B and here small C right save it and I will provide for example small B let's see what happens I can see very good right so if I provide small b or capital B I will see this message but the condition is you should not provide break in between these two cases so in this way you can use switch cases to evaluate multiple conditions in PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and by
