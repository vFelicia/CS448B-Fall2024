00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will learn how to use
00:07 - events in
00:09 - JavaScript so first of all what is an
00:11 - event an event can be an action which is
00:14 - performed to do some work for example
00:18 - you click some button you hover over
00:22 - some HTML element or you press some key
00:26 - right so let's see how we can use events
00:29 - in JavaScript so for example I will
00:33 - create a button element here and I add a
00:37 - text here and as an attribute of this
00:40 - button I will add an event called
00:44 - onclick okay so on click is an event and
00:49 - when this button is clicked I want to
00:51 - perform some action for example I want
00:54 - to alert something right now keep in
00:59 - mind here we we are using single code
01:02 - inside alert for example
01:05 - hello world and I think you may
01:09 - understood this because we are including
01:12 - Alert in double codes and if you use
01:15 - double codes here it will be not escaped
01:20 - and it will create some problem okay so
01:22 - let's save our code and uh refresh our
01:25 - web page and you see this button and
01:28 - when you click this button it will show
01:29 - show you this message called hello world
01:33 - right now for example I will create one
01:36 - more item here for example it is uh
01:40 - H1 tag and the ID of this H1 tag is for
01:48 - example my ID okay and instead of uh
01:52 - using this I can use uh this method in
01:56 - JavaScript which is called get element
01:59 - by ID and give your uh name of your ID
02:03 - which is my ID and keep in mind just add
02:07 - this ID in single codes here right then
02:10 - do inner HTML and there is a method in
02:15 - JavaScript called date and this returns
02:19 - current date and time okay so save your
02:22 - code and refresh your web page and once
02:25 - you click this button it's going to give
02:28 - you the current date and time with time
02:33 - zone here also now there can be
02:35 - different type of event which are
02:37 - possible and most common events are
02:41 - these so on click we have already used
02:44 - for example let's say we are using on
02:47 - Mouse over okay so instead of on click
02:51 - let's paste on Mouse over here save your
02:54 - code and refresh your web page and when
02:58 - you hover over your or a button not
03:01 - click but hover over and it will show
03:04 - you the result and once again when you
03:06 - hover it will uh refresh the time right
03:09 - you see it's refreshing the time in
03:13 - second okay now instead of using uh this
03:16 - JavaScript functionality here you can uh
03:19 - use a JavaScript function so just add a
03:23 - JavaScript function like this in the
03:25 - script tag make a function called show
03:29 - and what it does is it's doing the same
03:32 - job as this code okay so I'm going to
03:36 - remove this code from here and instead
03:39 - of uh this code I can call this
03:42 - JavaScript function right save your code
03:45 - and refresh your web page and when you
03:48 - hover over your mouse once again you see
03:52 - the same result now for example you want
03:56 - to show this time on this button itself
04:00 - what you can do you can do something
04:03 - like this so just copy this inner HTML
04:05 - is equal to date and just
04:08 - write this do inner HTML is equal to
04:12 - date and save your code and refresh it
04:16 - and when you hover over it it will show
04:19 - the date on your button okay so you can
04:23 - do this also now to use this
04:27 - onload event what you can do is is you
04:30 - can go to your body element and call
04:34 - this onload
04:36 - event is equal to the function for
04:40 - example we want to perform this function
04:43 - okay so do this and uh then you can
04:48 - remove this button because we don't need
04:51 - it right now and save your code and once
04:54 - you refresh your code it will show you
04:56 - this uh date and time when your body
05:01 - element loads now to use this on key
05:05 - down event what you can do here is
05:08 - instead of a button you can use a input
05:12 - and this input can be of type text and
05:16 - then you can uh call this uh on key down
05:21 - event here and you can call this
05:24 - function to your Onkey down event so
05:28 - like this okay and save your code and
05:32 - refresh your page and then it will show
05:35 - you this right so whenever you uh enter
05:41 - something in this input box then your
05:45 - time will change right you can see here
05:48 - okay now we must remove this from here
05:53 - in order to uh understand it clearly so
05:57 - once again refresh your web page and
05:59 - when whenever you enter something it
06:01 - refreshes your time okay so in this way
06:04 - you can use these events in JavaScript I
