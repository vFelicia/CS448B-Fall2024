00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:03 - this
00:03 - video we are going to discuss about
00:06 - bottom sheets in flutter
00:08 - so basically there are two types of
00:10 - bottom sheets in flutter the first one
00:12 - is persistent bottom sheet
00:14 - and the second one is modal bottom sheet
00:16 - the
00:17 - difference between these two types of
00:19 - sheets are that in persistent bottom
00:21 - sheet
00:21 - the sheet remains on the screen even
00:23 - though we are not interacting with it
00:26 - whereas in modal bottom sheet the sheet
00:29 - will hide
00:30 - if we are not interacting with it so
00:32 - let's start coding
00:35 - so first i'll remove all this
00:38 - code that we that we wrote while we were
00:42 - discussing about http requests
00:44 - we don't need this anymore
00:52 - i'll also remove the unused imports
01:01 - now once this is done in the center
01:04 - widget i'll add a
01:06 - raised button
01:10 - and the child will be
01:15 - text that says
01:18 - show bottom sheet
01:23 - and then it will have an on pressed
01:26 - and that will show the bottom sheet
01:30 - so first let's start with modal bottom
01:33 - sheet
01:33 - to display a modal bottom sheet we
01:36 - simply write
01:37 - show model bottom sheet
01:41 - now it takes two parameters that are
01:44 - necessary and the other ones are not
01:46 - necessary
01:47 - the first one is context and the context
01:49 - we have right over here
01:51 - this is the context so i'll simply write
01:54 - context
01:58 - and the next one is builder
02:01 - so it takes a function which has a
02:03 - parameter
02:04 - of build context
02:09 - and now over here we return the widget
02:11 - that will be displayed
02:13 - as our bottom sheet so i'll simply
02:16 - return a
02:18 - container of
02:23 - height 400
02:27 - and the color to be
02:30 - red so now let's format
02:34 - this save this
02:37 - and now we have a button in center and
02:39 - if i click on this
02:41 - i am able to see the modal bottom sheet
02:44 - so now as i said the sheet will hide if
02:47 - we don't
02:48 - interact with it so this is the bottom
02:51 - sheet let's not interact with this but
02:53 - interact with the remaining part so as
02:56 - soon as i click
02:57 - over here the bottom sheet hides
03:00 - so you understood what i was trying to
03:03 - say that
03:04 - the bottom sheet hides when we are not
03:07 - interacting with it
03:08 - and if that happens then that sheet is a
03:11 - modal
03:11 - bottom sheet okay now the next type of
03:15 - sheet is the persistent bottom sheet
03:18 - so for that we simply write show
03:22 - bottom sheet
03:26 - now format this save this
03:30 - now if i click on this okay so it is
03:33 - giving me an error
03:35 - so uh let's try another method
03:39 - to show a bottom sheet and the method is
03:42 - by using a global key
03:44 - so i'll write vr
03:48 - scaffold key
03:50 - and that will be a
03:54 - global that will be a global key
04:02 - okay and the global key will be of type
04:06 - scaffold state
04:12 - okay and then i'll add this key to our
04:15 - scaffold
04:17 - so the key over here is
04:20 - scaffold key so now what this basically
04:24 - does is that right now this is our
04:28 - scaffold scaffold is the area in which
04:31 - the contents are displaced or displayed
04:34 - like the app bar body the widgets inside
04:37 - the app bar
04:37 - widgets inside the body all those are
04:40 - displayed on the scaffold scaffold is
04:42 - like a canvas
04:44 - we can say it to be a canvas so by
04:47 - adding a key to the scaffold now we can
04:50 - access the state the context of this
04:54 - scaffold anywhere else by simply using
04:57 - this key
04:58 - okay and that is what we are gonna do
05:00 - over here to show the bottom sheet
05:03 - okay so i will simply comment this
05:07 - now to show a bottom sheet first we
05:10 - write the global key name that is
05:13 - in our case scaffold key then we
05:17 - take the current state okay so now over
05:20 - here you can see we
05:21 - with the scaffold key we can get three
05:24 - things first one is the context that is
05:26 - the current context
05:27 - the current state and the current widget
05:30 - that is being displayed
05:33 - so over here we need the current state
05:36 - and then on that we call show bottom
05:40 - sheet
05:41 - so now over here i'll return the same
05:44 - container
05:45 - let's see
05:48 - now i'll remove i'll remove the comment
05:51 - from here
05:52 - and then give a semicolon
05:55 - so now let's see
06:01 - now if i save and then if i click on
06:05 - this
06:05 - i am able to see my bottom sheet
06:09 - so this bottom sheet is a persistent
06:12 - bottom sheet okay and by that
06:15 - if i don't interact with this part of
06:18 - the sheet
06:19 - even then this will not disappear so if
06:22 - i click
06:22 - anywhere over here the sheet still
06:25 - remains if you want to close it
06:28 - programmatically we can do it by writing
06:30 - navigator dot of
06:32 - context dot pop and over here
06:35 - in app we can simply slide it down
06:38 - like this so these are the two types of
06:42 - sheet that we have in flutter
06:45 - that is the persistent bottom sheet
06:48 - and the modal bottom sheet so i hope the
06:51 - concept was clear
06:53 - thank you

welcome to programming knowledge so in this video we are going to discuss about bottom sheets in flutter so basically there are two types of bottom sheets in flutter the first one is persistent bottom sheet and the second one is modal bottom sheet the difference between these two types of sheets are that in persistent bottom sheet the sheet remains on the screen even though we are not interacting with it whereas in modal bottom sheet the sheet will hide if we are not interacting with it so let's start coding so first i'll remove all this code that we that we wrote while we were discussing about http requests we don't need this anymore i'll also remove the unused imports now once this is done in the center widget i'll add a raised button and the child will be text that says show bottom sheet and then it will have an on pressed and that will show the bottom sheet so first let's start with modal bottom sheet to display a modal bottom sheet we simply write show model bottom sheet now it takes two parameters that are necessary and the other ones are not necessary the first one is context and the context we have right over here this is the context so i'll simply write context and the next one is builder so it takes a function which has a parameter of build context and now over here we return the widget that will be displayed as our bottom sheet so i'll simply return a container of height 400 and the color to be red so now let's format this save this and now we have a button in center and if i click on this i am able to see the modal bottom sheet so now as i said the sheet will hide if we don't interact with it so this is the bottom sheet let's not interact with this but interact with the remaining part so as soon as i click over here the bottom sheet hides so you understood what i was trying to say that the bottom sheet hides when we are not interacting with it and if that happens then that sheet is a modal bottom sheet okay now the next type of sheet is the persistent bottom sheet so for that we simply write show bottom sheet now format this save this now if i click on this okay so it is giving me an error so uh let's try another method to show a bottom sheet and the method is by using a global key so i'll write vr scaffold key and that will be a global that will be a global key okay and the global key will be of type scaffold state okay and then i'll add this key to our scaffold so the key over here is scaffold key so now what this basically does is that right now this is our scaffold scaffold is the area in which the contents are displaced or displayed like the app bar body the widgets inside the app bar widgets inside the body all those are displayed on the scaffold scaffold is like a canvas we can say it to be a canvas so by adding a key to the scaffold now we can access the state the context of this scaffold anywhere else by simply using this key okay and that is what we are gonna do over here to show the bottom sheet okay so i will simply comment this now to show a bottom sheet first we write the global key name that is in our case scaffold key then we take the current state okay so now over here you can see we with the scaffold key we can get three things first one is the context that is the current context the current state and the current widget that is being displayed so over here we need the current state and then on that we call show bottom sheet so now over here i'll return the same container let's see now i'll remove i'll remove the comment from here and then give a semicolon so now let's see now if i save and then if i click on this i am able to see my bottom sheet so this bottom sheet is a persistent bottom sheet okay and by that if i don't interact with this part of the sheet even then this will not disappear so if i click anywhere over here the sheet still remains if you want to close it programmatically we can do it by writing navigator dot of context dot pop and over here in app we can simply slide it down like this so these are the two types of sheet that we have in flutter that is the persistent bottom sheet and the modal bottom sheet so i hope the concept was clear thank you
