00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install the pandas
00:04 - package on your Visual Studio code
00:06 - editor and run a panda script using the
00:11 - PIP package which you will install for
00:14 - pandas so right now I have this Visual
00:17 - Studio code editor opened and here I
00:20 - have this sample project open which
00:22 - doesn't contain any script so let's
00:24 - create a very simple Panda script I'm
00:27 - going to just create a file here which I
00:30 - name it as
00:32 - test.py and here I'm going to paste a
00:35 - very simple pandas code now when I uh
00:39 - want to run this code it's going to show
00:40 - me an error you can see this squiggly
00:43 - line on top of this pandas package and
00:45 - it says import pandas could not be
00:48 - resolved from The Source the problem
00:51 - here is we haven't installed the Panda's
00:55 - package and that's why it's showing me
00:57 - this error so let's see how we can solve
00:59 - Sol this problem so I'm going to open
01:02 - the terminal I'm going to click on
01:04 - Terminal and then click on new terminal
01:06 - and then let's uh first of all create a
01:10 - virtual environment and then we are
01:12 - going to install the pandas package the
01:14 - advantage of creating the virtual
01:16 - environment is that the pandas package
01:19 - will only be installed in your virtual
01:22 - environment and not globally on your Mac
01:25 - operating system so you can create
01:28 - different project with different Panda
01:30 - version at the later stage also so to
01:34 - create a virtual environment you just
01:36 - need to type uh Python and then press
01:40 - tab which is going to uh show you some
01:43 - kind of suggestions right so in my case
01:47 - my uh python script runs with Python 3
01:51 - and I also have python 3.12 so I can use
01:54 - either Python 3 or python 3.12 in your
01:57 - case you might have the different
01:59 - version of pyth python so you will see
02:02 - all the hints which are related to
02:05 - python just below your commands so I'm
02:08 - going to use the Python 3 in my case but
02:11 - whatever python version you have you can
02:13 - use that after Python 3 I'm going to
02:16 - write space hyphen M and then write VNV
02:21 - and then write the name of your virtual
02:23 - environment in my case I'm going to name
02:26 - it as en you can name it anything right
02:29 - you can name it my package or my en or
02:32 - anything so I'm going to name it as EnV
02:34 - and then press enter which is going to
02:36 - create this virtual en once this virtual
02:39 - EnV is created you can see this
02:41 - directory is created with the name EnV
02:44 - and here you will find few other
02:47 - directories also you will see that at
02:50 - the bottom of your Visual Studio code
02:52 - you will see that the environment will
02:54 - be changed to the new n uh environment
02:58 - which have the name n in my case you can
03:01 - switch between these environment
03:04 - using uh this down menu here I'm going
03:07 - to choose the virtual environment which
03:08 - I have
03:09 - created now we have just created the
03:13 - virtual nend but we also need to
03:15 - activate it before installing any third
03:18 - party package so to activate a virtual
03:20 - en we need to write this command which
03:23 - is source so just write Source command
03:27 - and then space your environment name in
03:31 - my case it's n here so whatever
03:34 - directory name you will see here we need
03:36 - to call that name we need to basically
03:39 - call this script which is under en there
03:42 - will be a bin directory and then we need
03:44 - to call the activate uh script so n
03:48 - slash bin slash activate and then press
03:52 - enter and then it's going to activate
03:55 - your virtual environment once the
03:57 - virtual environment is activated you
03:59 - will see this kind of n in front of your
04:03 - command line once the virtual
04:06 - environment is activated we can install
04:08 - the pandas package to install the pandas
04:11 - package the process is simple just type
04:14 - pip here and then press Tab Key to autoc
04:18 - complete so when you press Tab Key you
04:20 - can see different uh versions of pip you
04:24 - can use to install the packages I can
04:27 - use pip pip 3 and P pip
04:30 - 3.12 I'm going to use pip 3 here because
04:34 - for creating my virtual environment I
04:36 - have used the Python 3 command so I'm
04:38 - going to just give pip three install and
04:42 - the name of the package which is pandas
04:45 - in my case and then press enter it's
04:47 - going to install this pandas package and
04:50 - after a few seconds once the pandas
04:52 - package is installed you can see this
04:54 - squiggly line is gone from the pandas
04:59 - and once the package is installed I will
05:01 - be able to run this script without any
05:03 - error so let me clear the terminal just
05:07 - write clear here and then press enter
05:10 - and to run your code I'm going to once
05:12 - again use the Python 3 command it
05:14 - depends on what uh python version you
05:17 - have just use that then the name of the
05:20 - script which is test.py in my case and
05:23 - then I'm going to press enter and it's
05:25 - going to run my pandas script and you
05:30 - can see my p Panda script ran and it
05:33 - shows me different data frames and then
05:37 - uh all the columns related to this right
05:40 - so this is how you can uh install pandas
05:45 - with your Visual Studio code and run
05:48 - your Panda script inside your Visual
05:50 - Studio code on your Mac operating system
05:53 - I hope you've enjoyed this video and I
05:55 - will see you in the next video

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install the pandas package on your Visual Studio code editor and run a panda script using the PIP package which you will install for pandas so right now I have this Visual Studio code editor opened and here I have this sample project open which doesn't contain any script so let's create a very simple Panda script I'm going to just create a file here which I name it as test.py and here I'm going to paste a very simple pandas code now when I uh want to run this code it's going to show me an error you can see this squiggly line on top of this pandas package and it says import pandas could not be resolved from The Source the problem here is we haven't installed the Panda's package and that's why it's showing me this error so let's see how we can solve Sol this problem so I'm going to open the terminal I'm going to click on Terminal and then click on new terminal and then let's uh first of all create a virtual environment and then we are going to install the pandas package the advantage of creating the virtual environment is that the pandas package will only be installed in your virtual environment and not globally on your Mac operating system so you can create different project with different Panda version at the later stage also so to create a virtual environment you just need to type uh Python and then press tab which is going to uh show you some kind of suggestions right so in my case my uh python script runs with Python 3 and I also have python 3.12 so I can use either Python 3 or python 3.12 in your case you might have the different version of pyth python so you will see all the hints which are related to python just below your commands so I'm going to use the Python 3 in my case but whatever python version you have you can use that after Python 3 I'm going to write space hyphen M and then write VNV and then write the name of your virtual environment in my case I'm going to name it as en you can name it anything right you can name it my package or my en or anything so I'm going to name it as EnV and then press enter which is going to create this virtual en once this virtual EnV is created you can see this directory is created with the name EnV and here you will find few other directories also you will see that at the bottom of your Visual Studio code you will see that the environment will be changed to the new n uh environment which have the name n in my case you can switch between these environment using uh this down menu here I'm going to choose the virtual environment which I have created now we have just created the virtual nend but we also need to activate it before installing any third party package so to activate a virtual en we need to write this command which is source so just write Source command and then space your environment name in my case it's n here so whatever directory name you will see here we need to call that name we need to basically call this script which is under en there will be a bin directory and then we need to call the activate uh script so n slash bin slash activate and then press enter and then it's going to activate your virtual environment once the virtual environment is activated you will see this kind of n in front of your command line once the virtual environment is activated we can install the pandas package to install the pandas package the process is simple just type pip here and then press Tab Key to autoc complete so when you press Tab Key you can see different uh versions of pip you can use to install the packages I can use pip pip 3 and P pip 3.12 I'm going to use pip 3 here because for creating my virtual environment I have used the Python 3 command so I'm going to just give pip three install and the name of the package which is pandas in my case and then press enter it's going to install this pandas package and after a few seconds once the pandas package is installed you can see this squiggly line is gone from the pandas and once the package is installed I will be able to run this script without any error so let me clear the terminal just write clear here and then press enter and to run your code I'm going to once again use the Python 3 command it depends on what uh python version you have just use that then the name of the script which is test.py in my case and then I'm going to press enter and it's going to run my pandas script and you can see my p Panda script ran and it shows me different data frames and then uh all the columns related to this right so this is how you can uh install pandas with your Visual Studio code and run your Panda script inside your Visual Studio code on your Mac operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
