00:00 - hey guys back up to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorials for beginners
00:03 - and from this video I will show you how
00:07 - you can use loops in shell scripting and
00:11 - we will start with while loops so first
00:15 - of all what are loops the loop's are
00:19 - used to execute a list of command
00:21 - repeatedly so if you want to execute a
00:25 - command or list of commands repeatedly
00:27 - you can use loops so let's see how we
00:31 - can use while loop and first of all we
00:34 - will see what is the syntax of while
00:36 - loop so the syntax of while loop looks
00:39 - like this so you use the keyword while
00:42 - and in the square bracket you give the
00:46 - condition which you want to evaluate and
00:48 - if the condition is true then this
00:51 - command which are in between the keyword
00:55 - do and done are executed right so you
01:00 - write the keyword do and then whatever
01:03 - command you want to execute and when you
01:05 - are done with the while loop then you
01:09 - use the keyword done so let's take an
01:11 - example and then we will see how we can
01:14 - use loops so what I want is I want to
01:17 - print the number 1 to 10 or using while
01:21 - loop so I am going to declare a variable
01:23 - n is equal to 1 so I am assigning the
01:27 - value of 1 to n variable and then we
01:31 - will evaluate a condition so what
01:34 - condition we want to evaluate we want to
01:36 - evaluate whether the value of n is less
01:39 - than or equal to 10 or not and we have
01:44 - seen this - le flag in the if conditions
01:48 - also right now inside or in between do
01:52 - and done keyword we can execute any come
01:56 - on so what we are going to do is we are
01:58 - going to use echo and then we are going
02:02 - to print the value of n but still we are
02:05 - not done because we are just printing
02:09 - the value of N and the value of n is 1
02:11 - right so it
02:14 - execute infinitely because this
02:18 - condition is always true right so we
02:23 - want the code to increment the value of
02:27 - n and then we are good to go so how we
02:30 - can increase meant the value of n we can
02:33 - just use n is equal to and then you can
02:38 - just write dollar and double brackets
02:40 - and then n plus 1 like this and then
02:45 - this will increment the value of n by 1
02:47 - and assign it to and once again right so
02:52 - let's run the script once again and
02:53 - let's see what happens and it prints the
02:56 - value of N or it prints the number 1 to
03:01 - 10 right now what's happening in this
03:04 - loop so we have initially assigned the
03:07 - value of n is equal to 1 and then once
03:10 - this while loop is reached this while
03:14 - loop evaluates if the value of n is less
03:16 - than or equal to 10 or not and first of
03:20 - all the value of n is 1 which is less
03:22 - than or equal to 10 which is true and
03:25 - then it prints the value of n which is 1
03:28 - so it prints 1 here and then increments
03:31 - the value of n by 1 so now the value of
03:34 - n becomes 2 and once again it will go at
03:38 - the top and then here now the value of n
03:43 - is 2 which is still less than or equal
03:46 - to 10 so once again this code is
03:49 - executed right and the 2 is printed
03:53 - right in this way this will increment
03:56 - the value of n until 10 is reached and
03:59 - when the value of n is 10 this condition
04:04 - is still mad because n is equal to 10
04:08 - which is you know conforming to this
04:11 - condition so it will print the value of
04:12 - 4 10 here and then once the value of n
04:17 - becomes 11 and it reaches here so 11 is
04:21 - not less than or equal to 10 so this
04:25 - loop condition
04:27 - is false at this time and then this code
04:30 - will not be executed so once this new
04:34 - condition is false the code will not be
04:37 - executed right so this is what is
04:40 - happening here now the incrementation of
04:45 - variable and you can do in several ways
04:48 - so you can do something like this or you
04:51 - can just use the double bracket to
04:54 - increment the value of n and you can use
04:56 - double + which means post increment
04:59 - right so once again when I run the
05:02 - script it prints the value 1 to 10 once
05:05 - again now you can also do pre increment
05:08 - like this so just to pre increment and
05:11 - once again and we'll run the script and
05:14 - it prints the value of 10 once again 1
05:17 - to 10 now in here instead of using these
05:20 - square brackets you can also use these
05:23 - double parenthesis as we have seen with
05:27 - the if conditions also so this notation
05:31 - will also work but instead of using this
05:35 - - le flag you now need to use this kind
05:39 - of angle bracket and is equal to right
05:42 - so whenever you are using double
05:44 - parenthesis you need to give this kind
05:47 - of conditions right and then once again
05:51 - when you run the script it per still
05:53 - prints the value 1 to 10 right let me
05:56 - clear the terminal and this is how you
06:01 - can use while loops in bash scripting
06:05 - now in the next video I'm going to show
06:07 - you how you can for example read the
06:11 - files using by loops and do some other
06:14 - cool stuff with while loops so stay
06:17 - tuned and please recommend subscribe and
06:19 - bye for now

hey guys back up to the next video on shell scripting tutorials for beginners and from this video I will show you how you can use loops in shell scripting and we will start with while loops so first of all what are loops the loop's are used to execute a list of command repeatedly so if you want to execute a command or list of commands repeatedly you can use loops so let's see how we can use while loop and first of all we will see what is the syntax of while loop so the syntax of while loop looks like this so you use the keyword while and in the square bracket you give the condition which you want to evaluate and if the condition is true then this command which are in between the keyword do and done are executed right so you write the keyword do and then whatever command you want to execute and when you are done with the while loop then you use the keyword done so let's take an example and then we will see how we can use loops so what I want is I want to print the number 1 to 10 or using while loop so I am going to declare a variable n is equal to 1 so I am assigning the value of 1 to n variable and then we will evaluate a condition so what condition we want to evaluate we want to evaluate whether the value of n is less than or equal to 10 or not and we have seen this le flag in the if conditions also right now inside or in between do and done keyword we can execute any come on so what we are going to do is we are going to use echo and then we are going to print the value of n but still we are not done because we are just printing the value of N and the value of n is 1 right so it execute infinitely because this condition is always true right so we want the code to increment the value of n and then we are good to go so how we can increase meant the value of n we can just use n is equal to and then you can just write dollar and double brackets and then n plus 1 like this and then this will increment the value of n by 1 and assign it to and once again right so let's run the script once again and let's see what happens and it prints the value of N or it prints the number 1 to 10 right now what's happening in this loop so we have initially assigned the value of n is equal to 1 and then once this while loop is reached this while loop evaluates if the value of n is less than or equal to 10 or not and first of all the value of n is 1 which is less than or equal to 10 which is true and then it prints the value of n which is 1 so it prints 1 here and then increments the value of n by 1 so now the value of n becomes 2 and once again it will go at the top and then here now the value of n is 2 which is still less than or equal to 10 so once again this code is executed right and the 2 is printed right in this way this will increment the value of n until 10 is reached and when the value of n is 10 this condition is still mad because n is equal to 10 which is you know conforming to this condition so it will print the value of 4 10 here and then once the value of n becomes 11 and it reaches here so 11 is not less than or equal to 10 so this loop condition is false at this time and then this code will not be executed so once this new condition is false the code will not be executed right so this is what is happening here now the incrementation of variable and you can do in several ways so you can do something like this or you can just use the double bracket to increment the value of n and you can use double + which means post increment right so once again when I run the script it prints the value 1 to 10 once again now you can also do pre increment like this so just to pre increment and once again and we'll run the script and it prints the value of 10 once again 1 to 10 now in here instead of using these square brackets you can also use these double parenthesis as we have seen with the if conditions also so this notation will also work but instead of using this le flag you now need to use this kind of angle bracket and is equal to right so whenever you are using double parenthesis you need to give this kind of conditions right and then once again when you run the script it per still prints the value 1 to 10 right let me clear the terminal and this is how you can use while loops in bash scripting now in the next video I'm going to show you how you can for example read the files using by loops and do some other cool stuff with while loops so stay tuned and please recommend subscribe and bye for now
