With timestamps:

00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use timers
00:05 - with your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:07 - application so what is a timer generally
00:11 - we use timer when you need to give some
00:14 - interval to some function or some
00:18 - procedure so for example you want to
00:20 - show a message every 1 second or every
00:24 - 10 second you can use timer to execute
00:28 - this or for example you need need to
00:31 - increase a value by 10 every 1 second
00:36 - then you can use timer for that so let's
00:39 - see how we can use timer in Visual Basic
00:43 - so I will go to the
00:44 - toolbox and I will search for the timer
00:48 - and I will drag and drop to my form and
00:51 - you will notice when I drag and drop
00:53 - this timer to my form it will go down
00:56 - here and not directly to the form
01:00 - because it's not a visible tool it's a
01:04 - invisible tool right and now for the
01:08 - demonstration I will take a
01:11 - button actually I will take two buttons
01:14 - and I will
01:16 - take uh text box from
01:18 - here okay now what I will do is I will
01:23 - change the text of this first Button
01:28 - as start
01:31 - timer and the second button text
01:36 - as
01:38 - stop
01:40 - timer and I will change the text of this
01:43 - text box and I will give the value one
01:46 - here okay and let me change the font
01:50 - size of this
01:52 - um button so we can
01:55 - see it
01:57 - better okay this is the stop
02:01 - button and this
02:06 - is the start timer
02:13 - button
02:15 - and we have this text box so I will
02:18 - change the text box
02:24 - font okay now we have start timer button
02:28 - stop timer button and this text box and
02:32 - this timer now first of all I will go to
02:36 - this timer I will select this
02:38 - timer and in this timer tick event I'll
02:42 - will
02:46 - write textbox one which is the name of
02:49 - my text box dot
02:52 - text is equal to once again textbox
02:57 - one plus
03:00 - one for example
03:03 - okay so this means that
03:06 - whenever I add here I forgot the
03:13 - text here okay so whenever I enter
03:16 - something of any number in the text box
03:20 - which is already there which is one it
03:22 - will increase that number by one
03:26 - whenever this timer takes now we need to
03:29 - start and stop the timer also right so
03:32 - we have this button and here we will say
03:34 - double click this button and we
03:37 - say timer one which is our
03:41 - timer
03:43 - dot
03:45 - start and if you don't know where this
03:48 - timer one comes from just select this
03:51 - timer and see the name of this timer
03:53 - it's time of one right and same we will
03:56 - do for stop we will say
04:01 - timer 1 dot
04:06 - stop okay so this button click start the
04:09 - timer and this button click stop the
04:12 - timer but how does the timer know that
04:16 - after how many second or after how much
04:19 - interval it should take so let's see how
04:23 - we can set this time timer interval just
04:26 - select your timer and in the properties
04:28 - you will see a prop property called
04:31 - timer right so you can set the interval
04:34 - from here now
04:37 - this interval is in milliseconds so when
04:41 - you write 1,000 milliseconds here it'll
04:45 - take your timer by 1 second right so I
04:48 - set it here 1,000 millisecond now I will
04:52 - run the program to
04:55 - demonstrate and when I start the
04:58 - timer it ticks and it increases the
05:02 - value of the text box by one every
05:05 - second right and when I press stop
05:08 - button it stops the timer once again
05:13 - start the timer it starts and when I
05:17 - stop the timer with this button it stops
05:21 - so in this way you can use timer with
05:25 - your Visual Basic Windows Form
05:27 - application and in the next video I will
05:30 - show you how to show real date and time
05:35 - which is running every second using this
05:38 - timer tool so stay tuned and please
05:41 - write comment and subscribe and bye for
05:42 - now
