00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will discuss about built-in
00:06 - functions and modules in Python so the
00:10 - Python interpreter has a number of
00:13 - built-in functions modules and type that
00:17 - are always available that means you can
00:19 - use them at any time and we have already
00:22 - used some of the built-in functions in
00:25 - Python so first of all we have used the
00:29 - print built-in function we have already
00:31 - used the input built-in function we have
00:35 - already used the int which is used to
00:37 - typecast a float or a string into an
00:41 - integer right we have already used a
00:44 - built-in function called float which is
00:46 - used to convert an integer to a float
00:49 - value or a string to a float value now
00:53 - python has a list of these inbuilt
00:55 - function and you can find this list by
00:58 - going to the Python dot o-- r-- g--
01:00 - website and then clicking on that docs
01:04 - section and you can choose the version
01:06 - you have installed so we have installed
01:08 - the latest version which is 3.7.0 and
01:12 - you can even choose your language which
01:15 - are available here now when you click on
01:17 - this link which says library references
01:19 - you will be able to see this page which
01:21 - says Python standard library and then
01:24 - when you scroll down here you will be
01:27 - able to see the introduction about
01:28 - Python and the second section here is
01:31 - about built-in functions so I'm going to
01:33 - click on this built-in function link and
01:36 - here you will be able to see all the
01:38 - built-in functions in Python so this is
01:41 - the list of all the built-in functions
01:43 - which you can use in python and if you
01:47 - want to know more about these functions
01:49 - for example I want to know what this max
01:51 - function does I can click on this
01:54 - function and then you can get the help
01:56 - about this function so what this
01:58 - function does and how it can be used in
02:01 - Python all the information is given here
02:05 - now let's go to the terminal and let's
02:08 - see how we can use some of these
02:11 - built-in functions so first of all how
02:13 - you
02:13 - lists out all these built-in functions
02:16 - and types in Python there is a built in
02:20 - function to list out all the built-in
02:22 - functions and types which is dir and
02:25 - then double underscore and then you
02:28 - write built-ins and then once again
02:31 - double underscore and then close the
02:33 - parentheses and then press ENTER and
02:35 - it's going to give you the list of all
02:37 - the buildings available in Python so for
02:41 - example from this list we have already
02:43 - used this function called float print
02:46 - and then we have already used this
02:48 - function int and input also so let's use
02:51 - some more functions so in the previous
02:53 - videos I have shown you how to calculate
02:55 - the power of a number so you use these
02:58 - double asterisks in order to calculate
03:01 - the power of any number and you can see
03:04 - you get the power of 2 to the power 10
03:06 - now Python also have a built-in function
03:10 - called P or W here you can give as a
03:14 - first argument the number and as the
03:16 - second argument you can provide a number
03:18 - which you want to use as a power and
03:21 - when I press ENTER it gives me the same
03:24 - result let's use some other built-in
03:27 - function for example le n le n you can
03:31 - use to find out the length of any string
03:34 - so I can write le n and inside the
03:36 - parentheses I can just write any string
03:39 - here for example hello and it will give
03:42 - me the length of the string so this
03:45 - string hello have five letters inside it
03:48 - that's why it's giving me length 5 now
03:51 - there is a built-in function called help
03:53 - using which you can get some help about
03:56 - any function so I can write help here
04:00 - and inside the parentheses I can just
04:03 - write the function name so for example I
04:06 - want to know what this max function does
04:09 - so I can just write max here and then
04:12 - press Enter so it gives me the signature
04:14 - of Max so how it's used and then it will
04:17 - provide me some description about the
04:19 - function so what it does so you can see
04:22 - here it returns the biggest item right
04:25 - so I can just write
04:28 - here and inside the parentheses I can
04:30 - give the list of items here for example
04:33 - 1 2 8 9 4 & 5 and when I press enter is
04:40 - going to give me the maximum value out
04:42 - of this list so you can use this help
04:45 - built-in function in order to know more
04:47 - about all the other built-in functions
04:50 - now till now we have talked about the
04:52 - built-in functions which are available
04:54 - in Python now let's talk about some of
04:57 - the built-in modules which are available
04:59 - in Python now what is a module I'm going
05:02 - to describe in the later videos but for
05:05 - now let's see how to import a built-in
05:08 - module in Python and how to use them so
05:12 - there is a built-in module called math
05:14 - and to import it you just use a keyword
05:17 - called import and then the module name
05:22 - for example mat and press enter and it's
05:26 - going to import this module into our
05:29 - interpreter now you can use this math
05:32 - keyword and then you can write dot and
05:35 - wait for some seconds and you can see it
05:38 - gives me all the lists which are
05:40 - available inside this math module so
05:43 - let's say I want to find out the square
05:45 - root of any number I can use a function
05:49 - called sq RT here and then this gives me
05:54 - the square root of a number so for
05:57 - example I want to find out the square
05:59 - root of 100 and then press Enter it
06:02 - gives me the answer 10 now once again as
06:05 - I said you can use a built-in function
06:07 - called help in order to know the
06:10 - signature of this function so I can just
06:13 - write Matt dot s Q R T and then press
06:17 - ENTER and it's going to give me some
06:19 - help about this function so you can see
06:22 - it returns the square root of x and the
06:25 - signature looks like this now if you
06:28 - want to print all the methods and types
06:31 - available inside this built-in module
06:34 - you can once again use this built-in
06:37 - function dir and then in the parentheses
06:40 - right
06:41 - the name of the module so this time we
06:43 - will write math here and then press
06:45 - ENTER and it gives me the list of all
06:48 - the available functions available inside
06:51 - this math module and you can see all
06:54 - these functions which are available
06:56 - inside this module so you can just use a
06:58 - cost function from here PI function from
07:01 - here radiance or tan function from here
07:05 - so this is how you can use built-in
07:06 - functions and modules in Python I hope
07:10 - you've enjoyed this video I will see you
07:12 - in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to the next video on Python tutorial for beginners in this video we will discuss about builtin functions and modules in Python so the Python interpreter has a number of builtin functions modules and type that are always available that means you can use them at any time and we have already used some of the builtin functions in Python so first of all we have used the print builtin function we have already used the input builtin function we have already used the int which is used to typecast a float or a string into an integer right we have already used a builtin function called float which is used to convert an integer to a float value or a string to a float value now python has a list of these inbuilt function and you can find this list by going to the Python dot o r g website and then clicking on that docs section and you can choose the version you have installed so we have installed the latest version which is 3.7.0 and you can even choose your language which are available here now when you click on this link which says library references you will be able to see this page which says Python standard library and then when you scroll down here you will be able to see the introduction about Python and the second section here is about builtin functions so I'm going to click on this builtin function link and here you will be able to see all the builtin functions in Python so this is the list of all the builtin functions which you can use in python and if you want to know more about these functions for example I want to know what this max function does I can click on this function and then you can get the help about this function so what this function does and how it can be used in Python all the information is given here now let's go to the terminal and let's see how we can use some of these builtin functions so first of all how you lists out all these builtin functions and types in Python there is a built in function to list out all the builtin functions and types which is dir and then double underscore and then you write builtins and then once again double underscore and then close the parentheses and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the list of all the buildings available in Python so for example from this list we have already used this function called float print and then we have already used this function int and input also so let's use some more functions so in the previous videos I have shown you how to calculate the power of a number so you use these double asterisks in order to calculate the power of any number and you can see you get the power of 2 to the power 10 now Python also have a builtin function called P or W here you can give as a first argument the number and as the second argument you can provide a number which you want to use as a power and when I press ENTER it gives me the same result let's use some other builtin function for example le n le n you can use to find out the length of any string so I can write le n and inside the parentheses I can just write any string here for example hello and it will give me the length of the string so this string hello have five letters inside it that's why it's giving me length 5 now there is a builtin function called help using which you can get some help about any function so I can write help here and inside the parentheses I can just write the function name so for example I want to know what this max function does so I can just write max here and then press Enter so it gives me the signature of Max so how it's used and then it will provide me some description about the function so what it does so you can see here it returns the biggest item right so I can just write here and inside the parentheses I can give the list of items here for example 1 2 8 9 4 & 5 and when I press enter is going to give me the maximum value out of this list so you can use this help builtin function in order to know more about all the other builtin functions now till now we have talked about the builtin functions which are available in Python now let's talk about some of the builtin modules which are available in Python now what is a module I'm going to describe in the later videos but for now let's see how to import a builtin module in Python and how to use them so there is a builtin module called math and to import it you just use a keyword called import and then the module name for example mat and press enter and it's going to import this module into our interpreter now you can use this math keyword and then you can write dot and wait for some seconds and you can see it gives me all the lists which are available inside this math module so let's say I want to find out the square root of any number I can use a function called sq RT here and then this gives me the square root of a number so for example I want to find out the square root of 100 and then press Enter it gives me the answer 10 now once again as I said you can use a builtin function called help in order to know the signature of this function so I can just write Matt dot s Q R T and then press ENTER and it's going to give me some help about this function so you can see it returns the square root of x and the signature looks like this now if you want to print all the methods and types available inside this builtin module you can once again use this builtin function dir and then in the parentheses right the name of the module so this time we will write math here and then press ENTER and it gives me the list of all the available functions available inside this math module and you can see all these functions which are available inside this module so you can just use a cost function from here PI function from here radiance or tan function from here so this is how you can use builtin functions and modules in Python I hope you've enjoyed this video I will see you in the next video
