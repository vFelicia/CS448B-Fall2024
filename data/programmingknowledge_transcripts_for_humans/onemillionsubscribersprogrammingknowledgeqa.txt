00:01 - hey guys welcome to this channel and
00:03 - guess what we have reached 1 million
00:06 - subscribers on YouTube and I honestly
00:09 - couldn't believe that we have hit 1
00:12 - million mark so to celebrate this mark I
00:16 - have created this question and answers
00:18 - video so earlier today I have asked some
00:22 - of you in my YouTube community to ask
00:25 - some question about myself or regarding
00:29 - my channel so now I am going to answer
00:31 - some of your questions which you have
00:33 - asked so let's take your questions one
00:36 - by one so the first question was what is
00:40 - my name and where do I live so my name
00:43 - is Yogesh Patel and I am currently
00:46 - living in Germany so the next question
00:48 - is what do I do for living and what was
00:52 - my inspiration to start this channel so
00:55 - I'm a software developer by profession
00:58 - and about the inspiration so the
01:00 - inspiration was in 2012 I started
01:04 - creating those videos so the story
01:07 - behind that was in my university I have
01:10 - created some java swing related project
01:14 - and at that time it was really hard on
01:17 - YouTube to search about that particular
01:21 - programming language or programming
01:23 - languages in general so after finishing
01:26 - that project I decided to create a video
01:29 - about it and some of my batch mates
01:31 - wanted to know how I created this
01:34 - project so I started creating the videos
01:37 - regarding how I created this project so
01:40 - the next question is what was the first
01:43 - programming language which I have
01:45 - learned and which programming language
01:48 - do I think is going to dominate in the
01:51 - future so the first programming language
01:54 - which I have learned was C because I was
01:58 - into Hardware programming I started by
02:03 - programming microcontrollers and for
02:05 - programming microcontrollers we all know
02:08 - that the first language we need to
02:11 - used to program microcontroller is C so
02:15 - I started learning C to program some
02:18 - microcontrollers because I wanted to
02:21 - create some hardware project and that's
02:23 - how my programming learning journey
02:25 - began the next part of this question is
02:28 - which language do I think is going to
02:30 - dominate in the future so at this point
02:33 - I think Python is going to dominate in
02:36 - the future because it has everything you
02:39 - can develop anything from embedded
02:42 - systems to web servers to machine
02:46 - learning to graphical user interfaces to
02:50 - mobile apps anything you think of you
02:53 - can develop with Python so I think
02:56 - Python is going to dominate in the near
02:59 - future so the next question is how do I
03:02 - remember all the concepts and send texts
03:05 - about what I'm teaching so the simple
03:08 - answer is practice I learn I practice
03:11 - and that's the most important thing
03:14 - there is no magic in learning you need
03:19 - to learn the hard way and that's what I
03:21 - think you also need to do the next
03:23 - question is which editor do I use so
03:27 - nowadays I'm using Visual Studio code
03:29 - and I'm loving it so the last question
03:32 - is how does programming affects my life
03:34 - is it boring or exciting so the simple
03:38 - answer is yes it's very exciting that's
03:41 - why I'm doing it and nowadays I'm busy
03:44 - playing with my daughter she is one and
03:47 - a half year old and most of my time goes
03:49 - playing with her nowadays that's why I'm
03:52 - not able to create many videos as I want
03:57 - to and at last I just want to thank you
03:59 - guys for loving this channel and
04:02 - providing your support without your
04:04 - support this channel couldn't have
04:06 - reached where it has reached also tell
04:09 - me about your thoughts about this PD
04:11 - will I create more such videos or you
04:14 - don't like these kind of videos and if
04:16 - you have any other questions then you
04:18 - can ask in the YouTube community or in
04:22 - my facebook page or in the comments
04:25 - of any of the videos and I will try to
04:28 - answer them all thanks once again guys
