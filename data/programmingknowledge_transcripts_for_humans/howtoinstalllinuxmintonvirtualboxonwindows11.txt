00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download the Linux Mint
00:05 - ISO file and install it using virtualbox
00:09 - on your windows 11 operating system
00:12 - so let's get started so let's start with
00:14 - the ISO file download of Linux Mint so
00:19 - just go to your favorite browser and
00:21 - search for Linux Mint and the first link
00:23 - which will appear here will be from
00:25 - linuxmint.com so we are going to click
00:28 - on this link
00:29 - and straight away you will see this
00:31 - download button here also you can see
00:33 - the download link at the top so here you
00:36 - can hover over the download and then
00:39 - click on the latest version so we are
00:43 - going to click on this download button
00:44 - here so once you are on the download
00:47 - page you have three variants of Linux
00:50 - Mint you can download
00:52 - one is the cinnamon Edition which looks
00:55 - like this other is the mate Edition
00:58 - which looks like this and then third one
01:02 - is the xfce Edition which looks like
01:06 - this we are going to download and
01:09 - install the cinnamon Edition so just
01:12 - click on this button which says download
01:14 - under cinnamon Edition and then when you
01:17 - scroll down a little you will see the
01:20 - download mirrors so the first one here
01:23 - is the world mirror I will recommend you
01:27 - to choose the mirror which is near to
01:31 - your location so if you live in USA just
01:35 - choose from one of these options
01:38 - so I'm going to uh choose the first
01:41 - option which is the word option for
01:45 - Simplicity but I will recommend you to
01:48 - download the ISO file from the nearest
01:51 - location from your location so you can
01:55 - see it's around 2.8 GB file so it will
01:57 - take some time to download
01:59 - once this file is downloaded I have
02:02 - already downloaded this file so let me
02:03 - cancel this so once the file is
02:06 - downloaded it's going to look like this
02:08 - Linux Mint and then the version then
02:11 - cinnamon hyphen 64 bit dot ISO file
02:15 - so once you have this ISO file we are
02:18 - ready to install it on our virtualbox
02:22 - so just open your virtual box and we are
02:25 - going to create a new virtual machine so
02:27 - click on new button here
02:29 - and then just write
02:32 - Linux Mint here and
02:37 - Linux Mint is not available in the
02:40 - versions here so you can see when you
02:43 - type Linux Mint you have the type
02:46 - selected Linux automatically and
02:49 - automatically the version which is
02:51 - selected is Ubuntu 64-bit
02:53 - the reason for that is the Linux Mint
02:57 - option is not available here so you can
03:00 - see the Ubuntu option and the other
03:05 - options here you can see but there is no
03:10 - Linux Mint option
03:11 - so that's why we are going to choose the
03:16 - nearest uh version which is Ubuntu
03:21 - 64-bit and then click on next here
03:25 - now here you can choose the hardware
03:28 - right so generally what I do is
03:31 - you can see there is this green Mark
03:35 - here and then there is this red mark
03:37 - here so I move it where the green Mark
03:42 - ends and the red mark starts base memory
03:45 - I can allocate here this much amount of
03:48 - memory and then the processors I can
03:52 - allocate four processors for this one
03:55 - now you have this enable EFI special OSS
04:00 - only for now we are going to uh not
04:03 - going to enable this but you can enable
04:07 - this for for example for Windows
04:09 - operating system so I'm going to click
04:12 - on next so here you can choose the
04:14 - virtual hard disk size so depending on
04:17 - how much amount of hard disk available
04:21 - on your host machine in my case the host
04:24 - machine is Windows right so I can easily
04:28 - allocate 100 GB because I have one
04:31 - terabyte of space available on my
04:34 - Windows operating system so I will just
04:36 - move it around 100 GB but it totally
04:40 - depends on how much memory you have
04:42 - so you can choose that here and then you
04:46 - have the pre-allocate full size here I
04:50 - generally don't like to check this
04:52 - checkbox I want my memory to be
04:54 - dynamically allocated and I don't want
04:57 - to pre-allocate the full size so just
04:59 - leave it as unchecked and then click on
05:01 - next
05:02 - here you can see the summary what you
05:05 - have chosen so
05:07 - our type or version is Ubuntu 64-bit
05:10 - base memory is this one processor 4 and
05:14 - then disk size is around 100 GB in my
05:17 - case and then click on finish here
05:19 - once you click on finish your virtual
05:21 - machine is created
05:23 - now click on Linux Mint here and then go
05:26 - to the settings we can just
05:30 - do some more settings in this settings
05:32 - window for your virtual machine in
05:35 - general section you have these four tabs
05:38 - here go to the advanced Tab and then
05:42 - click on shared clipboard here you can
05:46 - just choose bi-directional for shared
05:49 - clipboard and drag and drop
05:51 - so this is going to allow you to copy
05:55 - from your Windows operating system to
05:58 - your Linux Mint operating system and
06:00 - vice versa right so this is for the
06:03 - shared clipboard and you can also drag
06:05 - and drop files from host to your Linux
06:09 - Mint virtual machine so just choose
06:12 - these two options as bi-directional you
06:15 - have system
06:17 - so here I have already chosen my memory
06:20 - and processors but if you haven't chosen
06:22 - yours you have the option to choose it
06:25 - now
06:27 - so now I'm going to move it to display I
06:30 - will leave everything as default here in
06:32 - the storage you have the option to
06:36 - provide the ISO file
06:38 - so if you remember we have downloaded
06:41 - this Linux Mint ISO file so you can
06:44 - click on this empty option here under
06:47 - controller and then click on this disk
06:50 - icon and then click on
06:53 - the choose a disk file so I'm going to
06:57 - click on choose a disk file and then I'm
06:59 - going to just copy the path where my
07:01 - Linux Mint ISO file is located and then
07:04 - paste it here and then select my ISO
07:08 - file for Linux Mint and then click on
07:09 - open
07:10 - which is going to just set this ISO file
07:14 - for my virtual machine so you can see
07:17 - this ISO file is set here so now I can
07:20 - click on OK
07:22 - and once all the settings are done I can
07:25 - start my virtual machine so click on
07:26 - start here so now you can see uh the
07:30 - Linux Mint installation has been started
07:33 - so here you have few options right the
07:37 - first option is start Linux Mint
07:39 - cinnamon 64-bit you have the
07:43 - compatibility mode you have the OEM
07:45 - install and then test memory mode
07:48 - so we are going to choose the first
07:51 - option which is Linux Mint uh the
07:54 - version cinnamon 64-bit just press enter
07:59 - here if you are on some other
08:02 - version you can use your down or up
08:05 - arrow keys to move up or down right so
08:08 - choose the start Linux Mint which is the
08:11 - first option here
08:14 - which is going to start the Linux Mint
08:16 - on your virtualbox
08:19 - so you can see the Linux Mint virtual
08:21 - machine has been started so now you can
08:24 - have the look and feel of your Linux
08:29 - Mint virtual machine so you can see you
08:32 - can click here and then you can open the
08:35 - terminal from here and you can open the
08:37 - folders or files from here right
08:40 - but the Linux Mint installation is not
08:43 - yet finished right so this is just for
08:45 - the look and feel but here you can see
08:47 - the install Linux Mint option with the
08:50 - disk icon so just click on this uh disk
08:53 - icon here which is going to actually
08:55 - start the installation of Linux Mint on
08:59 - your virtualbox
09:02 - so because we haven't given any username
09:05 - or password to log into our Linux Mint
09:09 - so these are the things we are going to
09:12 - do in the installation step so first of
09:15 - all you need to choose the language in
09:17 - the first step I will choose English
09:19 - here and then click on continue here
09:23 - and then you can choose the keyboard
09:26 - layout right so in different countries
09:28 - people use different keyboard layouts so
09:32 - for example I am living in Germany so I
09:34 - will choose the German keyboard layout
09:36 - if you are not sure you can also select
09:39 - detect keyboard layout from here right
09:42 - so let me choose the German language
09:45 - keyboard layout from here
09:48 - and then I'm going to choose the default
09:50 - German one once you have selected your
09:52 - keyboard layout click on continue
09:54 - and then you have this option so
09:58 - multimedia codex I'm going to click on
10:01 - this checkbox and then click on continue
10:03 - and then you have this option so here
10:06 - you can see this computer currently has
10:08 - no detected operating system what would
10:10 - you like to do erase this can install
10:13 - Linux Mint and then second option is do
10:16 - something else
10:17 - just leave this option which says it is
10:20 - disk and install Linux Mint it's not
10:23 - going to delete your host operating
10:27 - system it's just the option for your
10:30 - virtualbox so it's not going to do
10:32 - anything to your Windows operating
10:34 - system or any other host operating
10:36 - system which you are using it's just the
10:39 - step so don't worry about erasing
10:42 - anything just
10:43 - leave it as it is and then click on
10:47 - install now
10:50 - and then you have this option so write
10:54 - the changes to the disk if you continue
10:56 - the changes listed below will be written
10:59 - to the disk so I will click on continue
11:01 - here
11:03 - and now you can choose the location
11:06 - right so this is for the time settings
11:11 - and date settings so just choose the
11:14 - location which is nearer to your
11:16 - location by default Linux Mint is going
11:18 - to detect the nearest location but if
11:23 - it's not selecting that then you can
11:25 - choose it manually from here and then
11:27 - click on continue
11:30 - now at this point you need to give the
11:33 - username and password and the name of
11:36 - your computer
11:37 - so the name I'm going to give here is
11:40 - code bind here and then the computer
11:43 - name will be code bind hyphen virtualbox
11:46 - because we are installing it on
11:49 - virtualbox but generally I don't want
11:51 - this virtualbox extension here so I just
11:55 - change the name to uh the same name I
11:58 - have given here right
12:00 - so the username in my case is code bind
12:03 - you can leave it as what you want
12:07 - and then give the password so I'm going
12:09 - to provide a very simple password and
12:13 - then once again I'm going to provide the
12:15 - password again
12:17 - you might want to have the strong
12:18 - password
12:20 - and then you have this option require my
12:22 - password to log in and then click on
12:24 - continue
12:27 - and then the installation of Linux Mint
12:30 - will start so you need to wait for few
12:33 - uh minutes at this point so that Linux
12:37 - Mint installation can be finished and
12:40 - now after some time you can see the
12:42 - installation has been completed and you
12:44 - will see this kind of window which says
12:46 - installation is finished you can
12:49 - continue testing Linux Mint now but
12:51 - until you restart the computer and it
12:53 - changes you make or documents you save
12:57 - will not be preserved so we are going to
13:00 - restart our Linux Mint so just click on
13:03 - restart Now button which is going to
13:06 - restart your Linux Mint and now it has
13:09 - been restarted so I'm going to give my
13:12 - password which I have given at the time
13:15 - of installation so let me give that
13:17 - password again and then press enter and
13:19 - now I can see my Linux Mint operating
13:23 - system has been started on Virtual box
13:26 - right
13:28 - for the first time you will see this
13:29 - kind of Welcome window which says
13:31 - welcome to Linux Mint and then you can
13:35 - just go through this tour but if you
13:39 - don't want to do that just click on this
13:41 - cross and then
13:44 - you can start using Linux Mint
13:46 - now let me resize this Linux Mint you
13:49 - can see
13:51 - when I resize my virtual box window
13:54 - the desktop size for Linux Mint is not
13:58 - resizing
13:59 - so to resolve this problem you need to
14:03 - click on devices here and then click on
14:06 - insert guest Edition CD image
14:10 - so basically in order to have all the
14:14 - other features like resizing of this
14:18 - desktop according to the size of your
14:21 - virtualbox window you need to install
14:23 - virtualbox guest editions on your
14:27 - virtual machine and this you can do by
14:30 - clicking on device and then click on
14:31 - insert guest additions CD image
14:38 - and after few seconds you will see this
14:41 - kind of pop-up window which says this
14:44 - medium contains software intended to be
14:46 - automatically started just click on run
14:49 - here and then give your Linux mints
14:52 - password so let me
14:53 - give my password here and then click on
14:55 - authenticate
14:57 - and then it will start the installation
15:00 - of virtualbox guest editions so you just
15:03 - need to wait for few seconds until this
15:06 - installation is finished and once the
15:09 - installation of virtualbox gas station
15:11 - is finished you will see this kind of
15:13 - message at the end which says press
15:16 - return to close this window so at this
15:19 - point you just need to press enter key
15:21 - on your keyboard which is going to close
15:23 - this window and now you just need to
15:26 - restart your Linux Mint once again so
15:29 - click on this icon here click on this
15:32 - red button here and then click on
15:34 - shutdown which is going to shut down
15:37 - your Linux Mint virtual machine and from
15:41 - the next time when you restart your
15:43 - Linux Mint so just select Linux Mint
15:45 - here and then click on start and when
15:47 - your Linux Mint starts you can see when
15:50 - you resize your virtual box window the
15:54 - Linux Mint desktop also resizes
15:57 - accordingly right so let me just
16:00 - give my password again
16:02 - and then I can just maximize this and
16:05 - you can see
16:06 - the Linux Mint window also resizes
16:09 - according to the size of my desktop on
16:12 - my host machine right
16:14 - so now you can start using Linux Mint on
16:18 - your virtualbox on your host machine my
16:22 - guess the host machine is Windows 11.
16:25 - so I hope you've enjoyed this video I
16:26 - will see you in the next video

let me cancel this so once the file is downloaded it's going to look like this Linux Mint and then the version then cinnamon hyphen 64 bit dot ISO file so once you have this ISO file we are ready to install it on our virtualbox so just open your virtual box and we are going to create a new virtual machine so click on new button here and then just write Linux Mint here and Linux Mint is not available in the versions here so you can see when you type Linux Mint you have the type selected Linux automatically and automatically the version which is selected is Ubuntu 64bit the reason for that is the Linux Mint option is not available here so you can see the Ubuntu option and the other options here you can see but there is no Linux Mint option so that's why we are going to choose the nearest uh version which is Ubuntu 64bit and then click on next here now here you can choose the hardware right so generally what I do is you can see there is this green Mark here and then there is this red mark here so I move it where the green Mark ends and the red mark starts base memory I can allocate here this much amount of memory and then the processors I can allocate four processors for this one now you have this enable EFI special OSS only for now we are going to uh not going to enable this but you can enable this for for example for Windows operating system so I'm going to click on next so here you can choose the virtual hard disk size so depending on how much amount of hard disk available on your host machine in my case the host machine is Windows right so I can easily allocate 100 GB because I have one terabyte of space available on my Windows operating system so I will just move it around 100 GB but it totally depends on how much memory you have so you can choose that here

in my case and then click on finish here once you click on finish your virtual machine is created now click on Linux Mint here and then go to the settings we can just do some more settings in this settings window for your virtual machine in general section you have these four tabs here go to the advanced Tab and then click on shared clipboard here you can just choose bidirectional for shared clipboard and drag and drop so this is going to allow you to copy from your Windows operating system to your Linux Mint operating system and vice versa right so this is for the shared clipboard and you can also drag and drop files from host to your Linux Mint virtual machine so just choose these two options as bidirectional you have system so here I have already chosen my memory and processors but if you haven't chosen yours you have the option to choose it now so now I'm going to move it to display I will leave everything as default here in the storage you have the option to provide the ISO file so if you remember we have downloaded this Linux Mint ISO file so you can click on this empty option here under controller and then click on this disk icon and then click on the choose a disk

just maximize this and you can see the Linux Mint window also resizes according to the size of my desktop on my host machine right so now you can start using Linux Mint on your virtualbox on your host machine my guess the host machine is Windows 11. so I hope you've enjoyed this video I will see you in the next video
