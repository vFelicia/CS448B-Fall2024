00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video this is John from programming
00:07 - knowledge and in this video guys I'm
00:08 - going to show you and teach you how to
00:10 - use if statements in C programming
00:14 - language so I think from the previous
00:17 - video we have like touched the basic
00:19 - usage of if statement so we have tried
00:23 - if statement with the logical operators
00:27 - so the end the relational operators the
00:33 - you know greater than less than or less
00:36 - than or equal to in other relational
00:40 - operators okay but in this particular
00:42 - video guys I'm going to go deeper with
00:45 - the if statement and how we can apply if
00:50 - statement in our C program and of course
00:53 - guys I want to show you the practical
00:54 - approach on how to how you can implement
00:57 - if statement in a c program so basically
01:00 - guys if statements in C is used to
01:04 - control the program flow based on some
01:08 - conditions so it is used to execute some
01:11 - statement code block if the expression
01:13 - is evaluated to true so otherwise it
01:17 - will get skipped and we will try to
01:20 - implement a simple or basic program
01:25 - utilizing the if statement so actually
01:28 - guess there are four different types of
01:29 - if statement in C so this our you know
01:33 - simple if statement we also have if-else
01:37 - statement we also have nested if-else
01:41 - statement and we also have else if
01:44 - ladder in c programming language but for
01:49 - now let's just focus on the simple if
01:51 - statement so basically the structure of
01:56 - if statement is just like this so we
02:02 - have this particular format or basic
02:06 - format if statement in C we have F
02:09 - keyword and then open and close
02:12 - parenthesis
02:13 - and then inside of this open and close
02:16 - parentheses is the best expression okay
02:21 - or the condition and then of course we
02:26 - should you know add curly braces open
02:29 - and close curly braces and then of
02:31 - course the statement to execute whenever
02:35 - the test expression or condition is met
02:38 - or in this particular case if this
02:41 - particular condition is evaluated in to
02:44 - true okay so now let's try to implement
02:49 - the practical approach of an if
02:51 - statement so say for example you are
02:54 - developing a program or a software for a
02:58 - particular bar okay and then that
03:02 - particular bar only accepts customers
03:06 - that are over 18 years old and those
03:09 - customers that are below 18 years old
03:12 - are not allowed to enter the
03:14 - establishment or the bar itself and we
03:16 - can create a very simple program for
03:18 - that and our program will accept the age
03:21 - of the customer and then it will
03:24 - evaluate the age and it will display a
03:27 - message based on that particular age so
03:30 - the first thing that we're going to
03:32 - declare here is the variable age which
03:35 - has the type of int and of course we
03:39 - need to display something on to the
03:41 - screen that says to input a number that
03:45 - pertains to the age of the customer so
03:49 - in order for us to do that we need to
03:52 - use the method printf and then in here
03:56 - we can say enter the customers the
04:02 - customer or enter the age of the
04:06 - customer okay then you can add colon and
04:10 - then space so we can have like this
04:12 - space for our input age now we have this
04:18 - output and we need something to accept a
04:24 - number from our user so we can use the
04:27 - method I think we already use this
04:29 - before the scan F right so in here we
04:34 - need to specify the format specifier for
04:37 - RH which has % D which which pertains to
04:45 - the values that are of type in okay and
04:50 - then of course after this we need to add
04:53 - the comma and of course the variable H
04:58 - and of course we need to end this line
05:01 - with a semicolon but the proper way of
05:04 - doing this is to add an upper son
05:07 - ampersand symbol okay so basically what
05:11 - we're doing here is just we're getting
05:12 - the address of age and assigned value
05:15 - that particular address using the value
05:21 - that has been inputted by the user
05:23 - okay and of course we can now apply our
05:27 - if statement with this particular age so
05:30 - the first thing that we're going to
05:32 - check if the age is greater than 18 a so
05:38 - we can just copy and paste this age
05:41 - variable and then we can add the logical
05:47 - operator greater than so basically what
05:50 - we're doing here is to check if the age
05:53 - is greater than 18 okay so there you go
05:58 - and then of course the statements
06:02 - statements to execute if condition is
06:09 - true okay so basically what we can do
06:13 - here is to print the age the age is
06:23 - greater than 18 okay
06:31 - and basically it says or it means that
06:35 - the customer can enter the premises or
06:38 - the bar itself paid
06:40 - and of course we can also check if the
06:46 - user or the age of the customer is equal
06:51 - to 18 and could also check that by using
06:54 - the logical operator or the relational
06:57 - operator equals and equal equal symbol
07:01 - so this is just testing the age if it is
07:06 - equal to the value 18 so the first one
07:10 - is for testing the value of age if it is
07:13 - greater than 18 and the second one if it
07:15 - is equal to 18 and then of course we
07:18 - need to display the corresponding output
07:22 - so the age is equal to 18 okay
07:29 - and then of course we can add another
07:31 - one for this so we can just copy and
07:34 - paste for this one we need to check if
07:39 - the age is less than 18 so this is
07:43 - another logical operator that we have
07:46 - discussed from the previous videos okay
07:48 - so greater than equal and then of course
07:51 - less than 18 and of course we can output
07:56 - here like mine or is not allowed Hey
08:02 - that's because the age of the customer
08:05 - is less than 18 and the general rule
08:10 - when it comes to bar as minors are not
08:14 - allowed so basically what we're doing
08:15 - here is very simple program for that
08:18 - particular bar okay now we can try to
08:22 - run our program we can just you know
08:25 - build okay and then we can run our
08:29 - program and we have we can enter the age
08:34 - of the customer so for example the age
08:37 - of the customer is 18 so the age is
08:42 - equal to 18 okay so as you can see this
08:47 - is the only output or this this is the
08:51 - only statement that has been executed
08:53 - the
08:53 - equal to 18 because the other one the
08:58 - other condition is not being met or not
09:02 - evaluated to true pay because the age is
09:07 - equal to 18 and of course this is
09:13 - greater than 18 and of course this is
09:15 - less than 18 so we can try another one
09:19 - so for example the age is 19 so the age
09:26 - is greater than 18 and of course again
09:30 - this is the only statement that has been
09:34 - executed because it the condition
09:38 - evaluated to true this is evaluated to
09:42 - false because the age is not equal to 18
09:46 - and this one is evaluated to false also
09:50 - because the age is not less than to 18
09:54 - okay so you can try this one more time
09:58 - to check for the for example the age of
10:02 - the customer is 16 so the output is the
10:10 - miner is not allowed okay that's the
10:14 - practical way of using if statement in C
10:17 - programming language so I think that's
10:20 - all there is to it guys for this video
10:21 - and in the next video we are going to
10:23 - upgrade our program and to include the
10:27 - else statement for this particular
10:30 - program so thank you for watching guys
10:33 - and see you in the next video

hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys I'm going to show you and teach you how to use if statements in C programming language so I think from the previous video we have like touched the basic usage of if statement so we have tried if statement with the logical operators so the end the relational operators the you know greater than less than or less than or equal to in other relational operators okay but in this particular video guys I'm going to go deeper with the if statement and how we can apply if statement in our C program and of course guys I want to show you the practical approach on how to how you can implement if statement in a c program so basically guys if statements

is the best expression okay or the condition and then of course we should you know add curly braces open and close curly braces and then of course the statement to execute whenever the test expression or condition is met or in this particular case if this particular condition is evaluated in to true okay so now let's try to implement the practical approach of an if statement so say for example you are developing a program or a software for a particular bar okay and then that particular bar only accepts customers that are over 18 years old and those customers that are below 18 years old are not allowed to enter the establishment or the bar itself and we can create a very simple program for that and our program will accept the age of the customer and then it will evaluate the age and it will display a message based on that particular age so the first thing that we're going to declare here is the variable age which has the type of int and of course we need to display something on to the screen that says to input a number that pertains to the age of the customer so in order for us to do that we need to use the method printf and then in here we can say enter the customers the customer or enter the age of the customer okay then you can add colon and then space so we can have like this space for our input age now we have this output and we need something to accept a number from our user so we can use the method I think we already use this before the scan F right so in here we need to specify the format specifier for RH which has % D which which pertains to the values that are of

variable and then we can add the logical operator greater than so basically what we're doing here is to check if the age is greater than 18 okay so there you go and then of course the statements statements to execute if condition is true okay so basically what we can do here is to print the age the age is greater than 18 okay and basically it says or it means that the customer can enter the premises or the bar itself paid and of course we can also check if the user or the age of the customer is equal to 18 and could also check that by using the logical operator or the relational operator equals and equal equal symbol so this is just testing the age if it is equal to the value 18 so the first one is for testing the value of age if it is greater than 18 and the second one if it is equal to 18 and then of course we need to display the corresponding output so the age is equal to 18 okay and then of course we can add another one for this so we can just copy and paste for this one we need to check if the age is less than 18 so this is another logical operator that we have discussed from the previous videos okay so greater than equal and then of course less than 18 and of course we can output here like mine or is not allowed Hey that's because the age of the customer is less than 18 and the general rule when it comes to bar as minors are not allowed so basically what we're doing here is very simple program for that particular bar okay now we can try to run our program we can just you know build okay and then we can run our program and we have we can enter the age of the customer so for example the age of the customer is 18 so the age is equal to 18 okay so as you can see this is the only output or this this is the only statement that has been executed the equal to 18 because the other one the other condition is not being met or not evaluated to true pay because the age is equal to 18 and of course this is greater than 18 and of course this is less than 18 so we can try another one so for example the age is 19 so the age is greater than 18 and of course again this is the only statement that has been executed because it the condition evaluated to true this is evaluated to false because the age is not equal to 18 and this one is evaluated to false also because the age is not less than to 18 okay so you can try this one more time to check for the for example the age of the customer is 16 so the output is the miner is not allowed okay that's the practical way of using if statement in C programming language so I think that's all there is to it guys for this video and in the next video we are going to upgrade our program and to include the else statement for this particular program so thank you for watching guys and see you in the next video
