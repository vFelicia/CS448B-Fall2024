00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can solve a problem which
00:04 - appears while compiling your C or C plus
00:07 - plus programs which says no such file or
00:10 - directory
00:12 - so let's say I want to uh compile
00:16 - this main dot CPP file so I have created
00:19 - this main dot CPP file on my computer
00:24 - and I have written this program now I
00:28 - want to run this program so I will write
00:30 - this G plus plus command and then hyphen
00:33 - o and give the name of my output file
00:37 - for example main dot exe file
00:41 - and then I need to give the name of my
00:45 - CPP file but for some reason I just
00:49 - missed the name of my C plus file and I
00:54 - give the wrong extension for example
00:57 - instead of CPP file I just write main
01:01 - dot C right and when I press enter
01:06 - it says no such file or directory this
01:10 - problem occurs when you don't provide a
01:13 - correct file name while you compile your
01:17 - C or C plus plus program so you need to
01:20 - make sure that you are in the correct
01:23 - directory in which you want to run your
01:28 - C plus plus program right
01:31 - so my my C plus plus program is in my c
01:36 - apps directory so I am in the correct
01:38 - folder but I have provided the wrong
01:42 - file name right
01:45 - also
01:47 - let us say my extension is
01:50 - CPP right which is the extension of this
01:52 - file dot cpb but the file name I provide
01:57 - here is wrong so I can just say main dot
02:01 - CPP
02:03 - this is also going to show me this kind
02:06 - of error or if I have some space in the
02:11 - name of the file it's going to show me
02:13 - the same error right
02:16 - so to solve this error you need to go to
02:19 - the folder where you want to run your C
02:24 - plus plus or C file
02:27 - as in my case I am in my c apps folder
02:31 - and there is this main.cpp file but from
02:35 - this command line how you can make sure
02:38 - on your Windows operating system that
02:41 - what are the files available in the
02:43 - current directory you can give this
02:45 - command d i r command so just write dir
02:49 - and then press enter
02:50 - and once you write dir it's going to
02:54 - show you all the files which are present
02:57 - in your folder so the file name is main
03:01 - dot CPP file right right now I am
03:06 - opening my Powershell
03:08 - same you can do on the
03:14 - normal command prompt or The Terminal
03:17 - right so I can just right click here
03:19 - where my main dot CPP file or main.c
03:23 - file or whatever your COC program file
03:26 - name is just go to the directory right
03:29 - click there
03:30 - and then click on show more options if
03:34 - you don't see these options and then
03:36 - click on open in terminal
03:40 - and then just write dir to know the file
03:43 - content and you can see the file
03:46 - contents are main.cpp so the file name
03:49 - is main.cpb
03:51 - so if you are not sure just give the d i
03:54 - r command and you will see the file name
03:56 - there then you can simply write G plus
03:59 - plus and then hyphen o the name of your
04:04 - exe file which will be the output file
04:08 - which you will run after compiling your
04:11 - C plus plus program and then the name of
04:14 - your file which is main dot CPP right
04:19 - if you open the Powershell and you can
04:22 - just write main here and then press the
04:26 - Tab Key the Powershell also is going to
04:29 - auto complete your file name so if you
04:35 - have doubt just write first few letter
04:37 - of your file and then press Tab Key on
04:41 - your keyboard on your Windows operating
04:44 - system and the Powershell is going to
04:46 - auto complete your
04:49 - command right press enter
04:52 - and once you press enter it's going to
04:56 - create this main.exe file for you right
04:59 - so let me do it in my visual studio code
05:04 - editor also and let me remove this
05:07 - uh exe file
05:09 - let me move it to recycle bin
05:12 - and then I give the command G plus plus
05:16 - hypheno main.exe now I give the right
05:20 - name here which is main.cpp and then
05:24 - press enter
05:25 - and you can see it creates this main.exe
05:29 - file I can run this main.exe file by
05:32 - just writing main dot e x e and then
05:37 - press tab here okay when you press tab
05:40 - on Powershell it's going to add dot
05:43 - backslash automatically for you
05:46 - this is how you run your exe file on
05:50 - Powershell if you run command prompt so
05:53 - from here on Visual Studio code I can
05:56 - even open command prompt
06:00 - and on command prompt you can just give
06:03 - the name of your exe file directly and
06:06 - then press enter and you can run your
06:09 - program or you can
06:11 - open CMD here
06:14 - and then go to your
06:17 - folder and from there also you can run
06:21 - your file in a similar way so this is
06:23 - how you can solve this problem on your
06:27 - Windows operating system I hope you've
06:30 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
06:31 - the next video
