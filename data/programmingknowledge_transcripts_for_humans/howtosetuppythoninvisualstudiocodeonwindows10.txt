00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can set up Python
00:04 - development environment on your Visual
00:06 - Studio code editor so I'm going to go
00:10 - step by step first of all I'm going to
00:12 - show you how you can install Python and
00:14 - then I'm going to show you how you can
00:16 - install Visual Studio code and then I'm
00:19 - going to show you how you can set up
00:20 - Python on Visual Studio code so if you
00:24 - already have Visual Studio code or
00:26 - Python you can skip these installations
00:28 - steps and directly go to the you know
00:31 - integration step so for installing
00:34 - Python you just need to search for
00:36 - Python and the first link which will
00:38 - appear here will be from python or g i'm
00:40 - going to click on that link and i will
00:43 - scroll down a little here I can see the
00:45 - download section and the version I want
00:48 - to download here is three point six
00:50 - point four which is the latest version
00:52 - so I'm going to click on that and we are
00:55 - going to go to on the download page so
00:58 - inside the download page I'm going to
01:00 - scroll down a little and here we can see
01:04 - different file formats for installing
01:07 - python on our Windows operating system
01:09 - so what I'm going to choose is this one
01:12 - which is the executable installer which
01:15 - is really easy to install so just choose
01:19 - the version windows x86 64 is equal to
01:23 - be install right and now once this
01:28 - executable file is downloaded we are
01:31 - going to just install it like a normal
01:34 - executable file so now this executable
01:37 - file is downloaded so I'm going to click
01:39 - on this executable file
01:42 - let me just minimize the browser so now
01:47 - the Python installation wizard has been
01:48 - started and you can see this is the
01:50 - default location where Python will be
01:52 - installed and in order to add python
01:54 - part to our environment variable you
01:57 - just need to check this option which
02:00 - says add python 3.62 parts now I would
02:03 - like to install python in a different
02:06 - part because this is a little bit
02:09 - confusing part for me so this will be
02:12 - installed in
02:13 - Abdi the local programs peyten and then
02:18 - Python 3.6 right so I would just want to
02:21 - change the location so I will just
02:23 - select the customize installation for me
02:25 - but most of the people prefers default
02:29 - location and that's okay for them also
02:31 - okay and here I will just leave
02:35 - everything as default and click Next
02:37 - here and this is what I wanted to change
02:40 - so I just wanted to install Python in my
02:44 - C directory so I will just remove
02:46 - everything from here and then I wanted
02:50 - to install this Python in my C directory
02:55 - and then Python I want to make this
02:58 - directory Python so I want to make this
03:00 - directory Python and inside this
03:02 - directory I want to install the Python
03:06 - right so C and I'm going to just create
03:09 - a new directory here or new folder here
03:12 - with the name Python and then I'm I will
03:15 - press Enter so this directory is created
03:19 - and then inside my python directory this
03:24 - directory will be created right so I
03:26 - will just click install after stating my
03:31 - installation path and then just say yes
03:35 - is going to start the installation for
03:38 - python 3.6 right so now I can see this
03:42 - message which say setup was successful
03:44 - that means python is installed
03:45 - successfully on my system so i'm going
03:47 - to just click close and i'm going to go
03:51 - to my Start menu and here I will just
03:54 - click on all apps and in all apps I can
03:59 - see this Python Idol IDE is installed
04:03 - and then python 3.6 module docks are
04:07 - installed and then python 3.6 manual is
04:10 - installed and you can see python 3.6
04:14 - command line is also installed right so
04:18 - what i will do is i will just click on
04:21 - this option which is python 3.6 64 bit
04:24 - and you can see
04:27 - peyten you know terminal is started
04:30 - right so I can just write print the
04:34 - world and then press ENTER which is
04:36 - going to print hello world for me one
04:39 - thing I want to do is I want to set my
04:41 - environment variable for Python so I
04:44 - will go inside my Python directory and
04:45 - inside my Python directory I will go
04:47 - inside my Python 3/6 directory and then
04:51 - I will just copy this part and then once
04:55 - again right-click on the Start menu and
04:57 - then I will just go to system here and
05:01 - once the system settings the opens I
05:06 - will just go to advanced system settings
05:08 - and in the advanced system setting
05:10 - environment variables and here I'm going
05:13 - to add this environment variable to path
05:15 - so I will just select path system
05:18 - variable and I will say add it and then
05:21 - I will say new and then paste this path
05:24 - which I have copied which is C backslash
05:27 - Python backslash Pythian 36 and then
05:30 - press Enter click OK ok and then click
05:34 - OK which is going to set my Python part
05:38 - in the environment variables right I
05:40 - want to open the command prompt and just
05:45 - validate if python is set successfully
05:48 - so I'm going to just open the command
05:50 - prompt and here I will just write Python
05:54 - here and then press enter and you can
05:56 - see python 3 point 6 point 4 version is
05:59 - installed and i can see the python
06:02 - command line here ok so once everything
06:05 - is set we are ready to install visual
06:08 - studio code so the second thing we are
06:11 - going to install visual studio code so
06:13 - just search for visual studio code and
06:15 - hopefully the first link which will
06:17 - appear here will be from code dot visual
06:21 - studio comm so i'm going to click on
06:23 - this link so you can see you will see
06:26 - this option which says download wind for
06:28 - windows and once you click on this
06:30 - button alongside this download for
06:34 - windows button you will see the windows
06:37 - 64-bit option and i want to install the
06:40 - installer
06:41 - so just press the button just in front
06:44 - of installer is going to download the
06:47 - Installer which is Visual Studio code
06:49 - installer for you which is a executable
06:51 - file so now the Visual Studio code a exe
06:54 - is downloaded on my system so I'm going
06:56 - to click on this and then I'm going to
06:59 - minimize the browser which is going to
07:00 - start the Installer
07:01 - I will first of all say yes and then
07:05 - this is going to start the Visual Studio
07:07 - code installer I will just say next and
07:10 - I agree the terms and condition and then
07:14 - click Next and this will be the default
07:16 - location I don't want to change it so
07:18 - click Next and then click Next and then
07:21 - once again create click Next if you want
07:24 - to create the desktop icon you can check
07:26 - on this option and I'm going to click
07:28 - Next and then click install which is
07:31 - going to start installing the Visual
07:33 - Studio code it's really a
07:34 - straightforward process so you don't
07:37 - have to worry about it so now Visual
07:41 - Studio code is installed on my Windows
07:43 - operating system so I will just leave
07:45 - this checkbox checked which is going to
07:47 - launch the Visual Studio code and I'm
07:49 - going to click finish which is going to
07:51 - start Visual Studio code on my Windows
07:54 - 10 operating system and now you can see
07:56 - Visual Studio code has been started on
07:58 - my Windows 10 operating system and if
08:01 - you are not familiar with Visual Studio
08:03 - code here is where you will edit your
08:08 - file so when you click on this option
08:10 - you will be able to open any folder of
08:13 - your choice or you can create a new
08:16 - folder this is the search option so if
08:18 - you want to search inside folder some
08:20 - files or some words you can search using
08:24 - this search option this is for git
08:27 - integration the third option is forget
08:29 - integration or source code integration
08:32 - for example version controlling and
08:35 - other things right fourth option is for
08:38 - debugging which we are going to use for
08:41 - Python then the last option is for
08:44 - installing the extensions right so what
08:47 - I'm going to do is I'm going to click on
08:50 - this extension option option which is
08:52 - the last option so click on this
08:55 - option and here search for peyten
08:58 - okay so search for Python most probably
09:01 - the first result which will appear here
09:03 - will be Python option and you can see
09:07 - around 6 million downloads of this
09:09 - python extension has been done till now
09:12 - so this is from Microsoft
09:14 - so with this is the official Python
09:17 - extension from Microsoft so we are going
09:19 - to install this so just click on this
09:21 - install option this is going to install
09:23 - this extension on your Visual Studio
09:25 - code and once this extension is
09:28 - installed on your Visual Studio code
09:30 - editor
09:31 - you need to reload your Visual Studio
09:34 - code so you can see this option which
09:36 - says reload so just click on there that
09:38 - option and then it's going to reload
09:41 - your Visual Studio code so now Visual
09:44 - Studio code is reloaded and now this
09:46 - Python extension is installed on our
09:49 - system so now let's create Python folder
09:53 - on our desktop let's say and then we are
09:56 - going to open this folder so I'm going
09:59 - to create a Python folder on my desktop
10:01 - Python right and then I'm going to open
10:05 - this folder using this open folder
10:08 - option and I want to navigate to desktop
10:11 - and then Python and then select folder
10:14 - so this folder will be opened in my
10:18 - Visual Studio code editor okay so once
10:21 - this opens we are going to just create a
10:24 - new python file so i'm going to just
10:27 - click on this option which says new file
10:29 - or you can right-click and then say new
10:32 - file here and then I'm going to just say
10:36 - hello dot py which is the extension for
10:39 - python right which is going to tell
10:42 - Visual Studio code that it's a python
10:44 - file and now I'm going to just say print
10:47 - and then inside the parentheses I'm
10:50 - going to just write hello world and then
10:54 - I'm going to save my python file and it
10:57 - says linty py lint is not installed so
11:01 - this is also an extension which you can
11:03 - install from here so when you search for
11:06 - py lint you will be able to
11:08 - tall violent extension but for now I
11:11 - want don't want to install it so I will
11:14 - see this warning for now but later I
11:17 - will install it for sure right so I will
11:19 - just close this option and I will save
11:22 - my Python file and now to run my file
11:24 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
11:26 - to this debug section so just click on
11:29 - this debug section and here you just
11:32 - need to click on this green button you
11:35 - can notice here that there is no
11:37 - configuration right now so I will just
11:39 - click on this start debugging button and
11:42 - now when I click on this option it will
11:45 - just show me this warning I'll say allow
11:48 - access and now it says failed to launch
11:51 - the Python process please validate the
11:53 - path Python ok so I will just open the
11:56 - launch dot JSON file so just click on
12:00 - this option which says open launch dot
12:03 - Jason which is going to open the launch
12:06 - dot dot JSON file now if you don't know
12:08 - where this file is located on your
12:11 - folder you can just go here click on
12:14 - here and then go inside your dot vs code
12:19 - folder ok so inside your dot PS code
12:22 - folder you will be able to see launch
12:24 - launch dot jason file so you can see the
12:28 - name of the configuration is python and
12:31 - then stop on entry this is the debug
12:35 - option and then this is the Python path
12:38 - right so this Python path we can set in
12:42 - the settings dot Jason right so you can
12:45 - when you hover over this it says
12:47 - defaults to value in settings dot Jason
12:51 - right so what we are going to do is we
12:54 - are going to just go to the settings dot
12:56 - Jason which is the setting file for
12:57 - Visual Studio code so I'm going to go to
12:59 - files and then preferences and then just
13:02 - click on settings now this is going to
13:05 - open the settings for you on the left
13:07 - hand side you have the default setting
13:10 - and on the right hand side you have the
13:12 - user setting right so here search for
13:15 - Python path okay so this Python path is
13:21 - by default let
13:22 - see it's said to Python and we want to
13:26 - set this Python path to the Python
13:30 - executable location so I'm going to just
13:32 - copy this line and inside these curly
13:35 - brackets I'm going to paste this line
13:37 - and instead of this Python value I'm
13:40 - going to use the default location where
13:42 - python is installed which is c backslash
13:45 - python backslash 36 right so just copy
13:49 - this path and paste it here and then you
13:54 - will see little bit little error here so
13:57 - instead of backslash you just need to
14:00 - use the forward slash for windows and
14:03 - once again the forward slash and then
14:05 - once again the forward slash and then
14:07 - just write Python thought Exe okay and
14:12 - just save this settings dot JSON file
14:15 - and then you can just close the settings
14:18 - user settings and you can even close
14:21 - this launch dot JSON file okay so once
14:25 - it's closed once again we will try to
14:28 - run our python script using this start
14:32 - debugging option and once you just click
14:36 - on this green button you will see the
14:41 - debugging has been started right so when
14:44 - you just click on this green button it
14:46 - will print hello world on this debug
14:48 - console right and then for example you
14:53 - can just say X is equal to for example 9
14:57 - plus 6 and then also you can say Y is
15:01 - equal to 5 plus 9 let's say and then
15:07 - save your code and let's say I just put
15:10 - the breakpoint on the second line and
15:12 - then I'm going to just start debugging
15:15 - once again
15:16 - so once debugging has been started it
15:19 - will start from the first line because
15:21 - in launch dot JSON so let's go to the
15:24 - launch not chasing and you can see the
15:28 - option for a stop on entry is true so
15:32 - when you will just click false here or
15:35 - when you just write false here
15:37 - save this and once again when we just
15:40 - start the debugging it'll just start on
15:44 - the second line right so I'm going to
15:46 - start debugging once again and this time
15:49 - it goes on the breakpoint you can see
15:51 - right and here in the variables you will
15:55 - be able to see the value of x because
15:57 - this line has been executed we can go to
16:00 - the next line and now the value of y is
16:03 - set and when we go on the next line it
16:07 - will print hello world here okay so this
16:10 - is how you can set the Python
16:13 - development environment on Visual Studio
16:15 - code I hope you enjoyed this video
16:17 - please wait come to subscribe and bye
16:19 - for now

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up Python development environment on your Visual Studio code editor so I'm going to go step by step first of all I'm going to show you how you can install Python and then I'm going to show you how you can install Visual Studio code and then I'm going to show you how you can set up Python on Visual Studio code so if you already have Visual Studio code or Python you can skip these installations steps and directly go to the you know integration step so for installing Python you just need to search for Python and the first link which will appear here will be from python or g i'm going to click on that link and i will scroll down a little here I can see the download section and the version I want to download here is three point six point four which is the latest version so I'm going to click on that and we are going to go to on the download page so inside the download page I'm going to scroll down a little and here we can see different file formats for installing python on our Windows operating system so what I'm going to choose is this one which is the executable installer which is really easy to install so just choose the version windows x86 64 is equal to be install right and now once this executable file is downloaded we are going to just install it like a normal executable file so now this executable file is downloaded so I'm going to click on this executable file let me just minimize the browser so now the Python installation wizard has been started and you can see this is the default location where Python will be installed and in order to add python part to our environment variable you just need to check this option which says add python 3.62 parts now I would like to install python in a different part because this is a little bit confusing part for me so this will be installed in Abdi the local programs peyten and then Python 3.6 right so I would just want to change the location so I will just select the customize installation for me but most of the people prefers default location and that's okay for them also okay and here I will just leave everything as default and click Next here and this is what I wanted to change so I just wanted to install Python in my C directory so I will just remove everything from here and then I wanted to install this Python in my C directory and then Python I want to make this directory Python so I want to make this directory Python and inside this directory I want to install the Python right so C and I'm going to just create a new directory here or new folder here with the name Python and then I'm I will press Enter so this directory is created and then inside my python directory this directory will be created right so I will just click install after stating my installation path and then just say yes is going to start the installation for python 3.6 right so now I can see this message which say setup was successful that means python is installed successfully on my system so i'm going to just click close and i'm going to go to my Start menu and here I will just click on all apps and in all apps I can see this Python Idol IDE is installed and then python 3.6 module docks are installed and then python 3.6 manual is installed and you can see python 3.6 command line is also installed right so what i will do is i will just click on this option which is python 3.6 64 bit and you can see peyten you know terminal is started right so I can just write print the world and then press ENTER which is going to print hello world for me one thing I want to do is I want to set my environment variable for Python so I will go inside my Python directory and inside my Python directory I will go inside my Python 3/6 directory and then I will just copy this part and then once again rightclick on the Start menu and then I will just go to system here and once the system settings the opens I will just go to advanced system settings and in the advanced system setting environment variables and here I'm going to add this environment variable to path so I will just select path system variable and I will say add it and then I will say new and then paste this path which I have copied which is C backslash Python backslash Pythian 36 and then press Enter click OK ok and then click OK which is going to set my Python part in the environment variables right I want to open the command prompt and just validate if python is set successfully so I'm going to just open the command prompt and here I will just write Python here and then press enter and you can see python 3 point 6 point 4 version is installed and i can see the python command line here ok so once everything is set we are ready to install visual studio code so the second thing we are going to install visual studio code so just search for visual studio code and hopefully the first link which will appear here will be from code dot visual studio comm so i'm going to click on this link so you can see you will see this option which says download wind for windows and once you click on this button alongside this download for windows button you will see the windows 64bit option and i want to install the installer so just press the button just in front of installer is going to download the Installer which is Visual Studio code installer for you which is a executable file so now the Visual Studio code a exe is downloaded on my system so I'm going to click on this and then I'm going to minimize the browser which is going to start the Installer I will first of all say yes and then this is going to start the Visual Studio code installer I will just say next and I agree the terms and condition and then click Next and this will be the default location I don't want to change it so click Next and then click Next and then once again create click Next if you want to create the desktop icon you can check on this option and I'm going to click Next and then click install which is going to start installing the Visual Studio code it's really a straightforward process so you don't have to worry about it so now Visual Studio code is installed on my Windows operating system so I will just leave this checkbox checked which is going to launch the Visual Studio code and I'm going to click finish which is going to start Visual Studio code on my Windows 10 operating system and now you can see Visual Studio code has been started on my Windows 10 operating system and if you are not familiar with Visual Studio code here is where you will edit your file so when you click on this option you will be able to open any folder of your choice or you can create a new folder this is the search option so if you want to search inside folder some files

settings dot Jason right so what we are going to do is we are going to just go to the settings dot Jason which is the setting file for Visual Studio code so I'm going to go to files and then preferences and then just click on settings now this is going to open the settings for you on the left hand side you have the default setting and on the right hand side you have the user setting right so here search for Python path okay so this Python path is by default let see it's said to Python and we want to set this Python path to the Python executable location so I'm going to just copy this line and inside these curly brackets I'm going to paste this line and instead of this Python value I'm going to use the default location where python is installed which is c backslash python backslash 36 right so just copy this path and paste it here and then you will see little bit little error here so instead of backslash you just need to use the forward slash for windows and once again the forward slash and then once again the forward slash and then just write Python thought Exe okay and just save this settings dot JSON file and then you can just close the settings user settings and you can even close this launch dot JSON file okay so once it's closed once again we will try to run our python script using this start debugging option and once you just click on this green button you will see the debugging has been started right so when you just click on this green button it will print hello world on this debug console right and then for example you can just say X is equal to for example 9 plus 6 and then also you can say Y is equal to 5 plus 9 let's say and then save your code and let's say I just put the breakpoint on the second line and then I'm going to just start debugging once again so once debugging has been started it will start from the first line because in launch dot JSON so let's go to the launch not chasing and you can see the option for a stop on entry is true so when you will just click false here or when you just write false here save this and once again when we just start the debugging it'll just start on the second line right so I'm going to start debugging once again and this time it goes on the breakpoint you can see right and here in the variables you will be able to see the value of x because this line has been executed we can go to the next line and now the value of y is set and when we go on the next line it will print hello world here okay so this is how you can set the Python development environment on Visual Studio code I hope you enjoyed this video please wait come to subscribe and bye for now
