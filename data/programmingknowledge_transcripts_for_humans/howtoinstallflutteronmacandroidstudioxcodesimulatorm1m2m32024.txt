00:01 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install and set up
00:04 - flutter on your Mac operating system I'm
00:07 - going to show you how you can uh create
00:11 - your flutter app in Android studio and
00:13 - I'm also going to show you how you can
00:15 - run your flutter app in virtual Android
00:20 - emulator and virtual iOS emulator so
00:25 - let's get started and let's see how we
00:26 - can do it so first of all open your
00:28 - favorite browser and search for install
00:31 - flutter and the first link which will
00:33 - appear here will be from docs. flutter.
00:36 - deev for SL get started for slash
00:40 - install so I'm going to click on this
00:42 - link if you lend to the homepage of
00:44 - flutter click on get started and you
00:47 - will land on this page here you can
00:50 - choose Mac OS and then you have few
00:54 - options so if you want to develop an IOS
00:57 - app using flutter you can choose this
00:59 - option
01:00 - and if you want to create an Android app
01:03 - with flutter you can choose this option
01:05 - I'm going to show you both the ways so
01:08 - let's start with the iOS option here so
01:11 - I'm going to click on iOS here and then
01:15 - you have the getting started
01:17 - documentation for Mac OS so here you can
01:21 - see all these Hardware requirements and
01:24 - software requirements and when I scroll
01:27 - down what I need here for my flutter iOS
01:31 - development is this tool which is called
01:34 - xcode we are going to see how we can
01:37 - install X code in a moment but let's
01:40 - scroll down a little and let's see what
01:43 - else we need so in order to develop our
01:47 - flutter app we can use Visual Studio
01:49 - code Android Studio or intellig idea in
01:53 - this video I'm going to show you a demo
01:55 - of Android Studio so we are going to
01:58 - also download the Android studio and
02:01 - then when I scroll down a little I can
02:04 - also see uh install flutter
02:07 - SDK so you can install flutter SDK using
02:10 - visual studio code and you can install
02:14 - the flutter SDK zip file which is a
02:18 - standalone zip file so we are going to
02:20 - choose this option which says download
02:22 - and install and we are not going to
02:24 - choose this VSS code to install right so
02:27 - just click on download and install
02:30 - here so let's start with the SDK
02:34 - installation so when you click on
02:36 - download and install under flutter SDK
02:40 - you have two options here first one is
02:42 - for Intel processors and other one is
02:45 - for apple silicon chips for example M1
02:49 - M2 or M3 chip I have a Macbook which
02:52 - support apple silicon so I'm going to
02:54 - click on this option and once you click
02:58 - on this option this zip file is going to
03:01 - download so it's around 1.1 gbyte file
03:05 - so just wait for few seconds until this
03:08 - file is downloaded and once this ZIP
03:10 - file is downloaded you can see it will
03:13 - look like this now when you uh scroll
03:16 - down a little in this documentation it
03:19 - recommends us to create this development
03:22 - folder under your home directory and
03:25 - then it recommends us that we extract
03:29 - our flutter zip file in this development
03:32 - folder so first of all we are going to
03:35 - open our terminal and once you open the
03:38 - terminal as you can see it recommends us
03:41 - to create this development folder under
03:44 - your home directory so when you open
03:47 - your uh terminal you are directly in
03:50 - your home directory and when you write
03:53 - PWD here the home directly uh path looks
03:57 - like this for/ users for slash your
04:00 - username right under this we need to
04:03 - create the development folder to create
04:07 - the development folder just write
04:09 - mkdir and then development and then
04:12 - press enter and then you will be able to
04:16 - see this development folder under your
04:19 - home directory so you can see that this
04:22 - development folder is
04:24 - created so just copy this command but we
04:27 - need to change this command a little so
04:30 - I'm going to copy this command and paste
04:32 - it here let me just maximize this
04:34 - terminal and here we need to make few
04:38 - changes so because our uh flutter zip
04:43 - file is located in the downloads folder
04:46 - and not in the development folder so
04:48 - instead of this what we need to do is we
04:52 - need to just write till they for slash
04:56 - downloads for Slash the name of your
04:58 - flutter file
05:00 - right so if you write uh flutter and
05:02 - then press tab on your keyboard it's
05:05 - going to autoc complete your file name
05:09 - right so the command in our case is this
05:12 - unzip SL till SL downloads SL flutter
05:17 - Mac OS and whatever the version of uh
05:21 - flutter you have downloaded so this
05:24 - might change in your case and that's why
05:28 - I'm saying that that you can use the
05:30 - autocomplete feature of your Mac
05:32 - terminal so I'm going to just press
05:34 - enter here and you can see it's
05:37 - unzipping this uh ZIP file once this ZIP
05:41 - file is unzipped in the development
05:43 - folder let me clear the terminal and L
05:47 - CD into our development folder and here
05:51 - when you do LS you will be able to see
05:54 - this flutter folder here so when you uh
05:57 - just go to your uh MacBook desktop you
06:00 - can see this go option here just click
06:03 - on home folder which is going to open
06:06 - your home folder in your home folder you
06:08 - will be able to see this development
06:10 - folder and then under development you
06:12 - have this flutter folder and under
06:15 - flutter you have all these files in the
06:17 - next step we need to add the flutter
06:19 - path to our environment
06:21 - variables so if you're using newer
06:25 - versions of Mac it supports zsh on your
06:30 - terminal so what you need to do is you
06:33 - just need to add this uh flutter bin
06:36 - path in your zsh n file or you can also
06:42 - do the same in your zshrc file so if you
06:47 - already have zshrc file then you can add
06:52 - this path to zshrc file also so in my
06:57 - case zshrc File is already uh present so
07:02 - let me uh just write CD here so I'm in
07:05 - my home folder and when I write LS space
07:10 - hyphen Al you will be able to see that
07:14 - uh I have this zshrc file right so you
07:18 - can add this path into the zshrc file
07:23 - also if you don't have the zsh N file if
07:28 - you don't have zsh n or zshrc file just
07:33 - create this zsh n file and then just
07:37 - paste this path there in my case I'm
07:41 - going to open the zshrc file so I'm
07:45 - going to just write open then dot zshrc
07:50 - here and then press enter which is going
07:53 - to open my zshrc which already contains
07:57 - some other exports
08:00 - I'm going to just add this new export at
08:03 - the bottom of this file which is export
08:07 - path is equal to home/ development SL
08:10 - flutter SL bin colon dollar path as you
08:16 - might already remember
08:18 - that you can see this path here right so
08:22 - this is our home folder and then for/
08:25 - development and our flutter directory
08:28 - resides in the development folder and we
08:31 - are going to put this path into our
08:35 - zshrc which is the bin path inside this
08:39 - bin path there is this flutter binary
08:42 - which we are going to use once this
08:45 - environment variable is set so once you
08:48 - have added this path just save your file
08:51 - by pressing command s and then close
08:54 - your file so once you saved your file
08:57 - just close your terminal so just close
09:00 - your terminal then open a new instance
09:03 - of your uh terminal and once the
09:05 - terminal is open you can run the flutter
09:08 - command so I'm going to just write uh
09:11 - flutter here and then space hyphen
09:13 - hyphen version and then press enter and
09:16 - it's going to show me the version of
09:18 - flutter I have so you can see uh it has
09:22 - shown me this kind of uh welcome to
09:25 - flutter uh text here and it's going to
09:28 - also show me the flutter version which I
09:30 - have installed once you see this kind of
09:33 - output when you give flutter version
09:35 - command that means we have set the right
09:39 - environment variable for our flutter
09:42 - binary now once we have flutter
09:47 - installed then let's move to the next
09:50 - steps so I'm going to scroll up a little
09:54 - and we are going to uh install the X
09:57 - code so first of all you need to open
09:58 - the app app store you can find the App
10:01 - Store icon on the doc this is the App
10:04 - Store icon so just click on that or you
10:06 - can also search for App Store in your
10:10 - Launchpad and then click on that and App
10:13 - Store will start from here just search
10:16 - for xcode and then press enter which is
10:19 - going to search for xcode and the result
10:23 - which we are uh looking for is this one
10:26 - which is called excode developer tools
10:30 - here I'm going to click on this uh
10:32 - download button so in my case it shows
10:36 - this warning which ISS download the
10:37 - older version of xcode the current
10:39 - version requires Mac OS 13.5 or later
10:43 - but you can download the last compatible
10:45 - version because right now if I click on
10:48 - the Apple logo and then click on about
10:51 - uh this Mac I have the 13 version not
10:55 - the 13.5 so I can uh download the older
10:59 - version if you have the latest version
11:01 - of Mac OS uh you can download the latest
11:04 - version of uh compatible xcode here I'm
11:08 - going to click on download button which
11:10 - is going to start the download of the X
11:13 - code so you can see uh this download has
11:17 - been started it's around 7 GB uh of
11:21 - download so it will take some time for
11:24 - the download to complete you can also go
11:27 - to the Launchpad and see the download
11:29 - process here you can see this download
11:32 - is going on so it's going to download
11:36 - around 7 7 GB of uh data so it'll take
11:40 - some time so just wait for the download
11:42 - to finish so once the download is
11:45 - complete it's going to start the
11:46 - installation process as you can see when
11:48 - I hover over this circle installation
11:52 - process is about 2% complete so now the
11:56 - xcode is installed on my Mac operating
11:58 - Sy system once it's installed you will
12:00 - be able to see open button in front of
12:04 - xcode also in the launch pad you will be
12:07 - able to see this xcode icon so I'm going
12:10 - to click on this xcode icon let me
12:12 - minimize this app store and then it's
12:16 - going to start the xcode so for the
12:18 - first time when xcode starts on your Mac
12:21 - operating system it's going to ask to
12:23 - agree with the license terms and
12:25 - conditions so if you want you can read
12:27 - these license terms and condition and
12:29 - then click on agree and then give your
12:32 - MacBooks password which you use to log
12:35 - to your Mac operating system and then
12:37 - press okay and then you will be able to
12:39 - see this kind of window which says
12:41 - select the platforms which you would
12:43 - like to develop for for now I want to
12:47 - use it for Mac OS and iOS development
12:51 - later I can also install the toolkit for
12:55 - watch Os or TV OS but for now I don't
12:58 - want that so so I will just uh leave it
13:00 - as default and then click on install
13:02 - which is going to start the installation
13:04 - of additional components and you can see
13:07 - the progress bar of the installation so
13:10 - at this point I just need to wait for
13:12 - this progress bar to reach to the 100%
13:14 - Mark and once that's done xcode is going
13:18 - to launch in few seconds so you can see
13:21 - uh xcode has been
13:23 - started first of all it says what's new
13:26 - in xcode xcode Cloud Swift UI and it's
13:31 - going to give you the list of all the
13:34 - features I can click on continue here
13:37 - and now xcode has been started once you
13:40 - have xcode let's also install Android
13:43 - Studio so first of all open your
13:45 - favorite browser and search for Android
13:47 - studio and the first link which will
13:49 - appear here will be from
13:52 - developer.android.com we going to click

14:31 - operating system with Intel chip then
14:34 - you can click on this button if you are
14:36 - using the Mac operating system with the
14:39 - Apple chip for example M1 M2 M3 or any
14:43 - other Apple chip then click on this
14:46 - button so I have a MacBook with an apple
14:49 - chip so I'm going to click on this apple
14:51 - chip uh button here which is going to
14:54 - start the download of this DMG file so
14:58 - you can see uh at the time of uh making
15:01 - this video this file is around 1.1
15:04 - gigabyte files which is going to take
15:06 - some time to download so just wait for
15:09 - the download to complete here so once
15:12 - this DMG file is downloaded I'm going to
15:14 - click on this DMG file and then I'm
15:17 - going to minimize this
15:19 - browser so as you can see on this window
15:22 - the installation process is really
15:24 - simple you just need to drag this
15:26 - Android Studio icon into your
15:28 - applications folder so if you are using
15:31 - your MacBook and it's trackpad you just
15:35 - need to press command key on your
15:37 - keyboard and then select Android studio
15:39 - and then drag and drop this uh icon on
15:43 - your applications folder which is going
15:45 - to copy Android Studio into your
15:49 - applications folder you can see this
15:52 - copying is done now once the copying is
15:55 - done the Android Studio is installed on
15:58 - on our Mac operating system and then you
16:01 - can click on the Launchpad and then
16:04 - search for Android Studio here so I'm
16:06 - going to just uh search for Android
16:09 - Studio you can see this icon is
16:11 - available here so I'm going to click on
16:13 - this Android Studio icon which is going
16:15 - to start the Android Studio on our Mac
16:19 - operating system so first of all you
16:21 - will see this kind of window which says
16:23 - import Android Studio settings so if you
16:26 - are uh starting and Android Studio for
16:29 - the first time I will recommend you to

16:35 - not import settings here and then click
16:38 - on
16:39 - okay and then you will see this kind of
16:43 - uh window which says help improve
16:45 - Android Studio I don't want to share any
16:48 - uh data with uh Google so I'm going to
16:50 - click on don't send
16:52 - here and you can see this kind of
16:55 - Android Studio Setup Wizard so at this
16:58 - point I'm going to click on next here
17:01 - and then I'm going to choose the
17:03 - standard installation type you can also
17:06 - choose the custom one but uh I will
17:09 - recommend you to choose the standard one
17:11 - for now and then click on next and then
17:15 - you will see all these settings so you
17:18 - can verify all these settings here and
17:21 - then if you are happy with all those
17:23 - settings click on next and then on this
17:26 - next window you will see this license
17:28 - agreement so if you want you can read
17:31 - these license terms and conditions and
17:33 - if you agree with those license terms
17:36 - and conditions click on accept here and
17:39 - also select the second uh item here in
17:42 - this list which is the SDK arm and then
17:46 - accept here also okay so you need to
17:49 - accept in both the sections one for
17:53 - Android SDK license and other for
17:55 - Android SDK armed DBT
17:59 - license once you see this finish button
18:01 - click on finish which is going to start
18:04 - the download of all the components which
18:08 - Android Studio requires for its
18:11 - installation so this setting up of
18:13 - components uh will only happen once when
18:16 - you start your Android Studio for the
18:19 - first time so at this point you just
18:21 - need to wait for a few seconds until
18:25 - this installation of all those
18:27 - components uh is going on and now as you
18:30 - can see after a few seconds I can see
18:32 - this finish button here so I'm going to
18:34 - click on this finish button which is
18:37 - going to start Android Studio on my Mac
18:40 - operating system so once your Android
18:42 - Studio starts we are going to go to the
18:44 - plugins section here and then we are
18:47 - going to search for flutter here and you
18:51 - will see this result for flutter so I'm
18:53 - going to click on install and then click
18:56 - on accept which is going to in install
18:58 - this flutter plug-in in addition it's
19:02 - also going to add the support for DOT so
19:05 - dot will also be installed so I'm going
19:07 - to click on install here and then it's
19:10 - going to install flutter and also it's
19:13 - going to install the dot programming
19:15 - language once this is downloaded it's
19:18 - asking me to relaunch the Android Studio
19:21 - so I'm going to just click on restart
19:23 - IDE and then click on restart which is
19:26 - going to restart my Android Studio
19:29 - IDE once my Android Studio IDE starts I
19:33 - can see this new Option here for
19:36 - creating a new flutter project so once
19:39 - you have installed the flutter plug-in
19:42 - here let's open our terminal and let's
19:45 - run this command which is called
19:49 - flutter doctor command and then press
19:51 - enter and it's going to show you uh the
19:54 - status of all uh the tools so so when I
19:58 - run flutter doctor command I can see
20:02 - under Android tool chain that the
20:05 - command line tools component is missing
20:09 - here right so let's see how we can solve
20:12 - this problem so for this open your
20:15 - Android studio and then if you see this
20:19 - kind of interface then select more
20:23 - actions and then select SDK manager and
20:27 - then select Android's SDK option here
20:31 - and you will be able to see this SDK
20:33 - tools option and here you can see uh the
20:38 - flutter doctor command is complaining
20:42 - about this option which says Android SDK
20:45 - command line tools which is not
20:48 - installed yet so we are going to just uh
20:50 - check this checkbox and then click on
20:54 - apply and then click on okay which is
20:57 - going to install the the Android SDK
20:59 - command line tool once that's done just
21:02 - click on finish and now you can see this
21:05 - is installed and we can run the command
21:09 - once again so I'm going to click on okay
21:12 - and then once we run the flutter doctor
21:15 - command once again you can see that
21:18 - error is gone so now I have one more
21:22 - warning here but I don't see this
21:25 - command line tools component is missing
21:27 - at right so now I have one more warning
21:30 - here which says some Android license not
21:34 - accepted so for this I'm going to run
21:37 - this command which is suggested here so
21:39 - for this I'm going to run this command
21:41 - which is flutter doctor space hyphen
21:45 - hyphen Android hyphen license you can
21:48 - see this command I have already typed
21:50 - which is flutter do Android license
21:53 - press
21:54 - enter and then press y here and then
21:58 - press enter and once again press Y and
22:01 - then press enter and then just keep on
22:03 - pressing y until this license terms and
22:06 - conditions uh is accepted right so once
22:10 - you see that all SDK package license
22:14 - accepted I can run the flutter doctor
22:16 - command once again and this time I can
22:19 - see that Android tool chain is now fully
22:23 - installed so now when I run the flutter
22:26 - doctor command I can see uh this xcode
22:30 - error which says and it says xcode
22:33 - installation is incomplete a full
22:35 - installation is necessary for iOS and
22:38 - Mac OS development so to solve this we
22:41 - just need to open the X code I'm going
22:43 - to just search for xcode and then open
22:46 - this xcode once this xcode opens you
22:50 - will see the xcode menu at the top just
22:53 - click on xcode here and then select
22:56 - settings here if you see preferences
22:59 - option you can select the preferences
23:01 - option here once you do that just select
23:06 - locations tab here so select location
23:09 - Tab and here if you see uh this command
23:12 - line tool empty then select the version
23:16 - of xcode and it's going to ask you uh to
23:19 - provide your MacBooks password which you
23:22 - use to log to your Macbook so I'm going
23:24 - to just uh provide that password and now
23:27 - I can see that this xcode version is
23:30 - selected now let's run this uh flutter
23:34 - doctor command once again and now that
23:37 - error which we were seeing is gone right
23:41 - so now we have successfully installed
23:44 - the essential uh tools for Android
23:47 - development and also the essential tools
23:50 - for the iOS development earlier we were
23:54 - seeing this xcode related error now we
23:57 - are just seeing this coka pad not
24:01 - installed that we will uh not require
24:04 - for now so I'm going to leave it as it
24:06 - is but other tools are installed right
24:10 - so now what I'm going to do is we have
24:12 - already installed the flutter plug-in
24:15 - here so I can see this new flutter
24:17 - project option so I'm going to click on
24:19 - this option and then from the left hand
24:22 - side menu if you see uh this kind of uh
24:26 - option which is Select Ed for new
24:28 - project just select flutter here first
24:31 - so select flutter and you will see the
24:33 - path of your flutter SDK here click on
24:36 - next and then give any name to your
24:38 - flutter project so I'm going to give the
24:40 - name
24:43 - mycore flutter uncore app here and you
24:47 - need to give this name all in small
24:49 - letters separated by underscores in the
24:51 - organization you can leave it as uh
24:54 - default but later you might want to
24:55 - change this organization right we are
24:58 - just testing so we can leave all the
25:00 - other things as default and then click
25:02 - on create which is going to create our
25:05 - flutter project once this flutter
25:07 - project is uh created you will be able
25:10 - to see this kind of uh flutter project
25:13 - with your project name if you see uh
25:17 - here Android option instead of project
25:20 - so just click on this drop down menu and
25:22 - then select project here okay now once
25:25 - your flutter project is created to run
25:29 - your flutter app in the default Android
25:33 - emulator what you can do is in this uh
25:37 - device section right now no device is
25:39 - selected just click on this drop- down
25:42 - menu and then you have this Chrome web
25:45 - Mac OS desktop and you also have IOS
25:49 - simulator option here and you also have
25:52 - the Android emulator so one Android
25:55 - emulator is the default emul emulator
25:58 - which comes with Android Studio you can
26:00 - also install the new Android emulator
26:04 - okay so first of all we are going to run
26:08 - our app in the Android emulator so just
26:11 - select open Android emulator which is
26:14 - given here and once this device is
26:16 - selected here click on this run button
26:19 - which is going to first build your
26:21 - project and then it's going to launch
26:24 - your app into the Android emulator so
26:27 - you need wait for some time until you
26:30 - can see this process is finished here
26:33 - right so right now it's running the
26:35 - gradal task and then from here you can

26:41 - running I'm going to stop this and then
26:43 - I'm going to once again relaunch this so
26:47 - it's going to be stopped and you can see
26:48 - lost connection I'm going to click on uh
26:51 - start again which is going to start this
26:55 - Android emulator right and then when you
26:58 - run your uh application by using this
27:02 - run button your application will be
27:05 - launched in this uh emulator so you can
27:08 - see now our application is launched in
27:12 - this Android emulator sometimes it's
27:15 - hidden uh in this menu so you can uh
27:19 - just uh click on this uh running device
27:22 - option on the right hand side and it's
27:24 - going to open your Android m ulator now
27:28 - let's stop this and then let's try to
27:32 - run this app on the iOS device so now
27:36 - this time I'm going to select the open
27:39 - iOS simulator option so just select open
27:42 - iOS simulator which is going to open the
27:45 - iOS
27:46 - simulator because we have installed the
27:49 - xcode and xcode Tool chain this iOS uh
27:54 - simulator comes with that once this iOS
27:56 - simulator starts starts then from this
27:59 - list just select the iOS simulator which
28:02 - you have started so in our case we have
28:04 - started this iPhone 14 pro Max iOS
28:07 - simulator so I'm going to select this
28:10 - and once you see iPhone simulator
28:13 - selected here click on run again and
28:15 - it's going to launch your app into the
28:18 - iOS simulator just wait for a few
28:19 - seconds here now I can see my app is
28:23 - launched in the iOS simulator and I can
28:26 - click on Plus here and it increments the
28:30 - number so I can also test my application
28:33 - in the iOS simulator right so this is
28:37 - how you can set up the flutter using
28:40 - Android studio on the iOS simulator and
28:44 - the Android simulator on your Mac
28:47 - operating system I hope youve enjoyed
28:49 - this video and I will see you in the
28:51 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and set up flutter on your Mac operating system I'm going to show you how you can uh create your flutter app in Android studio and I'm also going to show you how you can run your flutter app in virtual Android emulator and virtual iOS emulator so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all open your favorite browser and search for install flutter and the first link which will appear here will be from docs. flutter. deev for SL get started for slash install so I'm going to click on this link if you lend to the homepage of flutter click on get started and you will land on this page here you can choose Mac OS and then you have few options so if you want to develop an IOS app using flutter you can choose this option and if you want to create an Android app with flutter you can choose this option I'm going to show you both the ways so let's start with the iOS option here so I'm going to click on iOS here and then you have the getting started documentation for Mac OS so here you can see all these Hardware requirements and software requirements and when I scroll down what I need here for my flutter iOS development is this tool which is called xcode we are going to see how we can install X code in a moment but let's scroll down a little and let's see what else we need so in order to develop our flutter app we can use Visual Studio code Android Studio or intellig idea in this video I'm going to show you a demo of Android Studio so we are going to also download the Android studio and then when I scroll down a little I can also see uh install flutter SDK so you can install flutter SDK using visual studio code and you can install the flutter SDK zip file which is a standalone zip file so we are going to choose this option which says download and install and we are not going to choose this VSS code to install right so just click on download and install here so let's start with the SDK installation so when you click on download and install under flutter SDK you have two options here first one is for Intel processors and other one is for apple silicon chips for example M1 M2 or M3 chip I have a Macbook which support apple silicon so I'm going to click on this option and once you click on this option this zip file is going to download so it's around 1.1 gbyte file so just wait for few seconds until this file is downloaded and once this ZIP file is downloaded you can see it will look like this now when you uh scroll down a little in this documentation it recommends us to create this development folder under your home directory and then it recommends us that we extract our flutter zip file in this development folder so first of all we are going to open our terminal and once you open the terminal as you can see it recommends us to create this development folder under your home directory so when you open your uh terminal you are directly in your home directory and when you write PWD here the home directly uh path looks like this for/ users for slash your username right under this we need to create the development folder to create the development folder just write mkdir and then development and then press enter and then you will be able to see this development folder under your home directory so you can see that this development folder is created so just copy this command but we need to change this command a little so I'm going to copy this command and paste it here let me just maximize this terminal and here we need to make few changes so because our uh flutter zip file is located in the downloads folder and not in the development folder so instead of this what we need to do is we need to just write till they for slash downloads for Slash the name of your flutter file right so if you write uh flutter and then press tab on your keyboard it's going to autoc complete your file name right so the command in our case is this unzip SL till SL downloads SL flutter Mac OS and whatever the version of uh flutter you have downloaded so this might change in your case and that's why I'm saying that that you can use the autocomplete feature of your Mac terminal so I'm going to just press enter here and you can see it's unzipping this uh ZIP file once this ZIP file is unzipped in the development folder let me clear the terminal and L CD into our development folder and here when you do LS you will be able to see this flutter folder here so when you uh just go to your uh MacBook desktop you can see this go option here just click on home folder which is going to open your home folder in your home folder you will be able to see this development folder and then under development you have this flutter folder and under flutter you have all these files in the next step we need to add the flutter path to our environment variables so if you're using newer versions of Mac it supports zsh on your terminal so what you need to do is you just need to add this uh flutter bin path in your zsh n file or you can also do the same in your zshrc file so if you already have zshrc file then you can add this path to zshrc file also so in my case zshrc File is already uh present so let me uh just write CD here so I'm in my home folder and when I write LS space hyphen Al you will be able to see that uh I have this zshrc file right so you can add this path into the zshrc file also if you don't have the zsh N file if you don't have zsh n or zshrc file just create this zsh n file and then just paste this path there in my case I'm going to open the zshrc file so I'm going to just write open then dot zshrc here and then press enter which is going to open my zshrc which already contains some other exports I'm going to just add this new export at the bottom of this file which is export path is equal to home/ development SL flutter SL bin colon dollar path as you might already remember that you can see this path here right so this is our home folder and then for/ development and our flutter directory resides in the development folder and we are going to put this path into our zshrc which is the bin path inside this bin path there is this flutter binary which we are going to use once this environment variable is set so once you have added this path just save your file by pressing command s and then close your file so once you saved your file just close your terminal so just close your terminal then open a new instance of your uh terminal and once the terminal is open you can run the flutter command so I'm going to just write uh flutter here and then space hyphen hyphen version and then press enter and it's going to show me the version of flutter I have so you can see uh it has shown me this kind of uh welcome to flutter uh text here and it's going to also show me the flutter version which I have installed once you see this kind of output when you give flutter version command that means we have set the right environment variable for our flutter binary now once we have flutter installed then let's move to the next steps so I'm going to scroll up a little and we are going to uh install the X code so first of all you need to open the app app store you can find the App Store icon on the doc this is the App Store icon so just click on that or you can also search for App Store in your Launchpad and then click on that and App Store will start from here just search for xcode and then press enter which is going to search for xcode and the result which we are uh looking for is this one which is called excode developer tools here I'm going to click on this uh download button so in my case it shows this warning which ISS download the older version of xcode the current version requires Mac OS 13.5 or later but you can download the last compatible version because right now if I click on the Apple logo and then click on about uh this Mac I have the 13 version not the 13.5 so I can uh download the older version if you have the latest version of Mac OS uh you can download the latest version of uh compatible xcode here I'm going to click on download button which is going to start the download of the X code so you can see uh this download has been started it's around 7 GB uh of download so it will take some time for the download to complete you can also go to the Launchpad and see the download process here you can see this download is going on so it's going to download around 7 7 GB of uh data so it'll take some time so just wait for the download to finish so once the download is complete it's going to start the installation process as you can see when I hover over this circle installation process is about 2% complete so now the xcode is installed on my Mac operating Sy system once it's installed you will be able to see open button in front of xcode also in the launch pad you will be able to see this xcode icon so I'm going to click on this xcode icon let me minimize this app store and then it's going to start the xcode so for the first time when xcode starts on your Mac operating system it's going to ask to agree with the license terms and conditions so if you want you can read these license terms and condition and then click on agree and then give your MacBooks password which you use to log to your Mac operating system and then press okay and then you will be able to see this kind of window which says select the platforms which you would like to develop for for now I want to use it for Mac OS and iOS development later I can also install the toolkit for watch Os or TV OS but for now I don't want that so so I will just uh leave it as default and then click on install which is going to start the installation of additional components and you can see the progress bar of the installation so at this point I just need to wait for this progress bar to reach to the 100% Mark and once that's done xcode is going to launch in few seconds so you can see uh xcode has been started first of all it says what's new in xcode xcode Cloud Swift UI and it's going to give you the list of all the features I can click on continue here and now xcode has been started once you have xcode let's also install Android Studio so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Android studio and the first link which will appear here will be from developer.android.com we going to click on this uh link and when this web page opens you will be able to see straight away this download button on this uh web page so we are going to click on this download button which is going to show you uh this kind of terms and conditions page you can read about these terms and conditions here and then scroll down at the very bottom where you need to agree with these terms and conditions so if you agree just check this check box and then you will see two buttons here so if you are using the MacBook or Mac operating system with Intel chip then you can click on this button if you are using the Mac operating system with the Apple chip for example M1 M2 M3 or any other Apple chip then click on this button so I have a MacBook with an apple chip so I'm going to click on this apple chip uh button here which is going to start the download of this DMG file so you can see uh at the time of uh making this video this file is around 1.1 gigabyte files which is going to take some time to download so just wait for the download to complete here so once this DMG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this DMG file and then I'm going to minimize this browser so as you can see on this window the installation process is really simple you just need to drag this Android Studio icon into your applications folder so if you are using your MacBook and it's trackpad you just need to press command key on your keyboard and then select Android studio and then drag and drop this uh icon on your applications folder which is going to copy Android Studio into your applications folder you can see this copying is done now once the copying is done the Android Studio is installed on on our Mac operating system and then you can click on the Launchpad and then search for Android Studio here so I'm going to just uh search for Android Studio you can see this icon is available here so I'm going to click on this Android Studio icon which is going to start the Android Studio on our Mac operating system so first of all you will see this kind of window which says import Android Studio settings so if you are uh starting and Android Studio for the first time I will recommend you to just leave this uh radio button on do not import settings here and then click on okay and then you will see this kind of uh window which says help improve Android Studio I don't want to share any uh data with uh Google so I'm going to click on don't send here and you can see this kind of Android Studio Setup Wizard so at this point I'm going to click on next here and then I'm going to choose the standard installation type you can also choose the custom one but uh I will recommend you to choose the standard one for now and then click on next and then you will see all these settings so you can verify all these settings here and then if you are happy with all those settings click on next and then on this next window you will see this license agreement so if you want you can read these license terms and conditions and if you agree with those license terms and conditions click on accept here and also select the second uh item here in this list which is the SDK arm and then accept here also okay so you need to accept in both the sections one for Android SDK license and other for Android SDK armed DBT license once you see this finish button click on finish which is going to start the download of all the components which Android Studio requires for its installation so this setting up of components uh will only happen once when you start your Android Studio for the first time so at this point you just need to wait for a few seconds until this installation of all those components uh is going on and now as you can see after a few seconds I can see this finish button here so I'm going to click on this finish button which is going to start Android Studio on my Mac operating system so once your Android Studio starts we are going to go to the plugins section here and then we are going to search for flutter here and you will see this result for flutter so I'm going to click on install and then click on accept which is going to in install this flutter plugin in addition it's also going to add the support for DOT so dot will also be installed so I'm going to click on install here and then it's going to install flutter and also it's going to install the dot programming language once this is downloaded it's asking me to relaunch the Android Studio so I'm going to just click on restart IDE and then click on restart which is going to restart my Android Studio IDE once my Android Studio IDE starts I can see this new Option here for creating a new flutter project so once you have installed the flutter plugin here let's open our terminal and let's run this command which is called flutter doctor command and then press enter and it's going to show you uh the status of all uh the tools so so when I run flutter doctor command I can see under Android tool chain that the command line tools component is missing here right so let's see how we can solve this problem so for this open your Android studio and then if you see this kind of interface then select more actions and then select SDK manager and then select Android's SDK option here and you will be able to see this SDK tools option and here you can see uh the flutter doctor command is complaining about this option which says Android SDK command line tools which is not installed yet so we are going to just uh check this checkbox and then click on apply and then click on okay which is going to install the the Android SDK command line tool once that's done just click on finish and now you can see this is installed and we can run the command once again so I'm going to click on okay and then once we run the flutter doctor command once again you can see that error is gone so now I have one more warning here but I don't see this command line tools component is missing at right so now I have one more warning here which says some Android license not accepted so for this I'm going to run this command which is suggested here so for this I'm going to run this command which is flutter doctor space hyphen hyphen Android hyphen license you can see this command I have already typed which is flutter do Android license press enter and then press y here and then press enter and once again press Y and then press enter and then just keep on pressing y until this license terms and conditions uh is accepted right so once you see that all SDK package license accepted I can run the flutter doctor command once again and this time I can see that Android tool chain is now fully installed so now when I run the flutter doctor command I can see uh this xcode error which says and it says xcode installation is incomplete a full installation is necessary for iOS and Mac OS development so to solve this we just need to open the X code I'm going to just search for xcode and then open this xcode once this xcode opens you will see the xcode menu at the top just click on xcode here and then select settings here if you see preferences option you can select the preferences option here once you do that just select locations tab here so select location Tab and here if you see uh this command line tool empty then select the version of xcode and it's going to ask you uh to provide your MacBooks password which you use to log to your Macbook so I'm going to just uh provide that password and now I can see that this xcode version is selected now let's run this uh flutter doctor command once again and now that error which we were seeing is gone right so now we have successfully installed the essential uh tools for Android development and also the essential tools for the iOS development earlier we were seeing this xcode related error now we are just seeing this coka pad not installed that we will uh not require for now so I'm going to leave it as it is but other tools are installed right so now what I'm going to do is we have already installed the flutter plugin here so I can see this new flutter project option so I'm going to click on this option and then from the left hand side menu if you see uh this kind of uh option which is Select Ed for new project just select flutter here first so select flutter and you will see the path of your flutter SDK here click on next and then give any name to your flutter project so I'm going to give the name mycore flutter uncore app here and you need to give this name all in small letters separated by underscores in the organization you can leave it as uh default but later you might want to change this organization right we are just testing so we can leave all the other things as default and then click on create which is going to create our flutter project once this flutter project is uh created you will be able to see this kind of uh flutter project with your project name if you see uh here Android option instead of project so just click on this drop down menu and then select project here okay now once your flutter project is created to run your flutter app in the default Android emulator what you can do is in this uh device section right now no device is selected just click on this drop down menu and then you have this Chrome web Mac OS desktop and you also have IOS simulator option here and you also have the Android emulator so one Android emulator is the default emul emulator which comes with Android Studio you can also install the new Android emulator okay so first of all we are going to run our app in the Android emulator so just select open Android emulator which is given here and once this device is selected here click on this run button which is going to first build your project and then it's going to launch your app into the Android emulator so you need wait for some time until you can see this process is finished here right so right now it's running the gradal task and then from here you can see uh right now this emulator is running I'm going to stop this and then I'm going to once again relaunch this so it's going to be stopped and you can see lost connection I'm going to click on uh start again which is going to start this Android emulator right and then when you run your uh application by using this run button your application will be launched in this uh emulator so you can see now our application is launched in this Android emulator sometimes it's hidden uh in this menu so you can uh just uh click on this uh running device option on the right hand side and it's going to open your Android m ulator now let's stop this and then let's try to run this app on the iOS device so now this time I'm going to select the open iOS simulator option so just select open iOS simulator which is going to open the iOS simulator because we have installed the xcode and xcode Tool chain this iOS uh simulator comes with that once this iOS simulator starts starts then from this list just select the iOS simulator which you have started so in our case we have started this iPhone 14 pro Max iOS simulator so I'm going to select this and once you see iPhone simulator selected here click on run again and it's going to launch your app into the iOS simulator just wait for a few seconds here now I can see my app is launched in the iOS simulator and I can click on Plus here and it increments the number so I can also test my application in the iOS simulator right so this is how you can set up the flutter using Android studio on the iOS simulator and the Android simulator on your Mac operating system I hope youve enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
