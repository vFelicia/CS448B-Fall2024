00:00 - hello guys now in this video we will be
00:02 - talking about our task two okay so let
00:04 - me discuss with you what we'll be doing
00:06 - in our this task so basically we will be
00:08 - connecting our remote machine with the
00:11 - SSH using bash script okay we will
00:13 - create a script with the help of this we
00:15 - will connect to that particular machine
00:16 - so we uh first of all let me tell you
00:19 - how you can create your virtual machine
00:20 - so actually I have there is a link for
00:24 - you I will add this link in our uh
00:26 - description then there is a tutorial to
00:28 - create a virtual machine you can easily
00:29 - do it okay and I have actually already
00:32 - created the machine so here is my public
00:35 - IP address I will copy this IP address
00:37 - and now I will create the script okay
00:40 - so let me open the vs code and I will
00:43 - just create the file 0 7 task two dot sh
00:48 - okay but before that I will tell you
00:50 - like
00:51 - if you want to do it on yourself you can
00:54 - easily do it okay
00:56 - so if you do it yourself and that will
00:58 - be very good for you so because you will
01:00 - get a more confidence as well you will
01:02 - learn more quickly so let me I will just
01:04 - give you the basic idea what we will be
01:06 - doing so I will take the username and
01:09 - the password okay not username and the
01:12 - IP and then I will use the SSH command
01:14 - to connect with that machine so this is
01:16 - the overall idea and if you want to take
01:18 - input from the parameter then also you
01:20 - can
01:22 - do it okay
01:24 - so first of all let's take the input I
01:27 - will prompt the user to enter the
01:29 - username first
01:31 - user name and then here I will create
01:34 - the username variable then I read hyphen
01:37 - P enter the
01:39 - IP
01:41 - so if I create the IP variable
01:43 - SSH command SSH dollar username we need
01:47 - to do dollar username
01:49 - dollar
01:52 - IB
01:54 - okay so this is the uh command which we
01:58 - we will use okay otherwise we can do
02:01 - with the passing parameters also you we
02:03 - will do it that also
02:05 - so now I will need to give the
02:07 - permission to this file 0 7 now we'll
02:12 - execute this file 0 7
02:14 - and I will enter the username as ayush
02:17 - and my IP is not this one
02:21 - here okay
02:24 - and my IP is this
02:27 - and it will ask me to enter the password
02:29 - so I will enter the password
02:33 - okay
02:34 - so here you can see I use I use the name
02:37 - of the vmh also if that's why it's
02:39 - showing like this I will do LS here so
02:41 - nothing is there who am I so name of the
02:44 - user I use here also so in this way you
02:47 - can connect with the uh remote machine
02:50 - using our bash script okay so you can do
02:53 - exit to exit come out of the machine and
02:57 - now we will see how we can uh connect
02:59 - with the uh using like parameters okay
03:03 - so what I will do I will just comment
03:05 - out these all and I will create a
03:08 - valuable username and it will be equal
03:12 - to the dollar one okay the first
03:14 - parameter then the IP will be equal to
03:17 - the dollar two okay we will save this
03:20 - script and I will just pass the
03:24 - parameters like I wish for username and
03:26 - IP for
03:28 - this okay two four seven
03:31 - hit enter
03:33 - and it will ask me to enter the password
03:38 - now we are good to go and again let's
03:42 - check who am I I wish okay so in this
03:45 - way you can connect with the remote
03:47 - machine easily you can use environment
03:49 - variables not environment variable you
03:51 - can pass parameters you can use
03:54 - variables okay whatever thing you want
03:56 - to do so I hope you liked it so this is
03:59 - a way to learn new things by while doing
04:01 - some new things like create I will like
04:05 - in future
04:06 - uh I will come up with more task okay
04:09 - so that's all for today's guys and I
04:11 - hope you have used all the concept which
04:13 - you have learned till now so that's all
04:15 - and I meet you in the next video thank
04:17 - you for watching

hello guys now in this video we will be talking about our task two okay so let me discuss with you what we'll be doing in our this task so basically we will be connecting our remote machine with the SSH using bash script okay we will create a script with the help of this we will connect to that particular machine so we uh first of all let me tell you how you can create your virtual machine so actually I have there is a link for you I will add this link in our uh description then there is a tutorial to create a virtual machine you can easily do it okay and I have actually already created the machine so here is my public IP address I will copy this IP address and now I will create the script okay so let me open the vs code and I will just create the file 0 7 task two dot sh okay but before that I will tell you like if you want to do it on yourself you can easily do it okay so if you do it yourself and that will be very good for you so because you will get a more confidence as well you will learn more quickly so let me I will just give you the basic idea what we will be doing so I will take the username and the password okay not username and the IP and then I will use the SSH command to connect with that machine so this is the overall idea and if you want to take input from the parameter then also you can do it okay so first of all let's take the input I will prompt the user to enter the username first user name and then here I will create the username variable then I read hyphen P enter the IP so if I create the IP variable SSH command SSH dollar username we need to do dollar username dollar IB okay so this is the uh command which we we will use okay otherwise we can do with the passing parameters also you we will do it that also so now I will need to give the permission to this file 0 7 now we'll execute this file 0 7 and I will enter the username as ayush and my IP is not this one here okay and my IP is this and it will ask me to enter the password so I will enter the password okay so here you can see I use I use the name of the vmh also if that's why it's showing like this I will do LS here so nothing is there who am I so name of the user I use here also so in this way you can connect with the uh remote machine using our bash script okay so you can do exit to exit come out of the machine and now we will see how we can uh connect with the uh using like parameters okay so what I will do I will just comment out these all and I will create a valuable username and it will be equal to the dollar one okay the first parameter then the IP will be equal to the dollar two okay we will save this script and I will just pass the parameters like I wish for username and IP for this okay two four seven hit enter and it will ask me to enter the password now we are good to go and again let's check who am I I wish okay so in this way you can connect with the remote machine easily you can use environment variables not environment variable you can pass parameters you can use variables okay whatever thing you want to do so I hope you liked it so this is a way to learn new things by while doing some new things like create I will like in future uh I will come up with more task okay so that's all for today's guys and I hope you have used all the concept which you have learned till now so that's all and I meet you in the next video thank you for watching
