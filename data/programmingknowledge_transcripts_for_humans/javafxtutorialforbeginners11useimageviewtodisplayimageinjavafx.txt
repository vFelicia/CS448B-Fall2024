00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how we can use images
00:07 - in Java FX so we will see how we can use
00:13 - image view to add images and we will
00:16 - also see how we can add images or icons
00:19 - to your buttons or labels so let's get
00:23 - started
00:23 - I will use the same project which I have
00:26 - created in the last video so I have
00:29 - created in the last video this Login
00:31 - project and I'm going to open this login
00:35 - dot F XML which I have created using the
00:38 - scene builder and this was the layout
00:43 - which I have created in the last video
00:45 - ok so I will go to the Eclipse IDE and
00:49 - first of all I will create some
00:52 - resources for the images right so I will
00:55 - go to my source package and I will
00:58 - create a new package here and I will
01:01 - name it as IMG for images right and I
01:05 - will click finish and inside the images
01:08 - package I can transfer some aged images
01:12 - right so I have this image of JavaFX
01:16 - logo and I can drag and drop into this
01:19 - image folder okay and just say copy file
01:24 - and click OK so now my image folder has
01:28 - this one PNG file right now we will go
01:32 - to the scene builder and there is a
01:34 - control called image view so let's
01:37 - search for the image view which we can
01:40 - drag and drop into our scene and inside
01:44 - this image view we can give the source
01:48 - of the image right you may see here
01:51 - there is a property here which is the
01:54 - first property which says image and you
01:56 - can you know search for your image and
01:59 - give the path of your image from here
02:02 - but we are not going to use this we are
02:06 - going to use the relative path which we
02:08 - have created ok so just drag and drop
02:11 - this image view and resize it
02:12 - accordingly
02:13 - to your requirement and save your f XML
02:18 - file so just save and go to your Eclipse
02:21 - IDE and open your login dot F XML and
02:25 - this is the image view which we have
02:27 - created it has the height of 150 and
02:31 - width of 200 right so what I'm going to
02:34 - do is I'm going to create this image
02:37 - element something like this so I will
02:39 - delete this forward slash from here and
02:41 - I will add this ending tag for image
02:46 - right and I will just press Enter and in
02:49 - between this image tag I can add one
02:52 - more element which is called image okay
02:57 - and inside this image element I can
03:00 - provide the source for the image so I
03:03 - will just add this element with capital
03:07 - I image and then I can provide URL is
03:12 - equal to the source of your image and
03:17 - just close it okay so the source for
03:21 - your image is inside your image folder
03:24 - so you can do something like this you
03:27 - can just write IMG slash the name of
03:30 - your image my image name is Java FX dot
03:34 - PNG now save your code and run it and
03:40 - now I can see this image is shown here
03:43 - right now for example you want to resize
03:45 - this image to smaller or bigger size
03:48 - right so how you can do it so right now
03:51 - our height is 150 and width is 200 here
03:57 - in the image view so you can change it
04:00 - for example I want 350 by 500 okay just
04:05 - save it and run it once again and now
04:09 - your image is resized to the size you
04:11 - have given here okay and for example I
04:15 - want to have a smaller image so I can
04:18 - give 50 by 100 save it and run it once
04:24 - again and now I have the small
04:27 - our image here right now for example I
04:31 - want to add the image to the button so I
04:35 - have this login button
04:37 - and I want to add some image to this
04:39 - button so how can I do it so what I can
04:42 - do here is I can go to my button element
04:46 - this is my button element and inside
04:50 - this button element I can add element
04:54 - called graphic so add this element and
04:58 - between this graphic element I'm going
05:01 - to add this image view element so just
05:04 - add image view and just close it and in
05:10 - between this image view I can just have
05:14 - the same code like this so just copy the
05:17 - same code from here and paste it here so
05:22 - what I have done here inside the button
05:24 - element I have added first of all this
05:26 - graphic element and using this graphic
05:29 - element I can use the image view inside
05:33 - this graphic element to show my image
05:35 - right so I can use this so something
05:40 - like this which is same as we have done
05:43 - in the last element here and save your
05:46 - code and run it once again and you can
05:50 - see here the image is added to the
05:53 - button but if you can see the image size
05:57 - is its original size so it's not resized
06:01 - because we haven't provided any size to
06:04 - the image view yet so you can see here
06:07 - our image view has no element so to
06:10 - resize your image you need to give these
06:14 - two attributes to your image view
06:17 - element one is fit height and other is
06:21 - fit width okay so for example I will
06:24 - give the same fit height and fit width
06:27 - parameter and fit height is 50 for us
06:31 - and fit width is 100 right now
06:34 - okay so run the code once again and now
06:38 - you can see the image is
06:40 - resized and now it looks good on this
06:44 - button okay so same you can do for
06:47 - labels or if you have some other
06:51 - controls you can add images to those
06:54 - controls like this okay
06:57 - so if you have a label it will be the
07:00 - same code like this okay
07:03 - now for example you want to add an image
07:07 - from online source so instead of using
07:11 - this local resource you can also use
07:15 - here the online resource for example you
07:19 - have some image somewhere located on
07:21 - internet for example I have this image
07:23 - on my website and I can see here and I
07:27 - just need to use the URL just copy the
07:30 - URL go to your code and instead of using
07:34 - this local path you can just paste your
07:38 - resource path which is online so my
07:42 - picture is on the website easy online
07:46 - converter comm slash images slash logo 1
07:50 - dot PNG right save the code and run it
07:53 - once again and now I can see this logo
07:56 - here on the button right so in this way
07:59 - also you can add images to your controls
08:02 - in JavaFX so I hope you enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use images in Java FX so we will see how we can use image view to add images and we will also see how we can add images or icons to your buttons or labels so let's get started I will use the same project which I have created in the last video so I have created in the last video this Login project and I'm going to open this login dot F XML which I have created using the scene builder and this was the layout which I have created in the last video ok so I will go to the Eclipse IDE and first of all I will create some resources for the images right so I will go to my source package and I will create a new package here and I will name it as IMG for images right and I will click finish and inside the images package I can transfer some aged images right so I have this image of JavaFX logo and I can drag and drop into this image folder okay and just say copy file and click OK so now my image folder has this one PNG file right now we will go to the scene builder and there is a control called image view so let's search for the image view which we can drag and drop into our scene and inside this image view we can give the source of the image right you may see here there is a property here which is the first property which says image and you can you know search for your image and give the path of your image from here but we are not going to use this we are going to use the relative path which we have created ok so just drag and drop this image view and resize it accordingly to your requirement and save your f XML file so just save and go to your Eclipse IDE and open your login dot F XML and this is the image view which we have created it has the height of 150 and width of 200 right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create this image element something like this so I will delete this forward slash from here and I will add this ending tag for image right and I will just press Enter and in between this image tag I can add one more element which is called image okay and inside this image element I can provide the source for the image so I will just add this element with capital I image and then I can provide URL is equal to the source of your image and just close it okay so the source for your image is inside your image folder so you can do something like this you can just write IMG slash the name of your image my image name is Java FX dot PNG now save your code and run it and now I can see this image is shown here right now for example you want to resize this image to smaller or bigger size right so how you can do it so right now our height is 150 and width is 200 here in the image view so you can change it for example I want 350 by 500 okay just save it and run it once again and now your image is resized to the size you have given here okay and for example I want to have a smaller image so I can give 50 by 100 save it and run it once again and now I have the small our image here right now for example I want to add the image to the button so I have this login button and I want to add some image to this button so how can I do it so what I can do here is I can go to my button element this is my button element and inside this button element I can add element called graphic so add this element and between this graphic element I'm going to add this image view element so just add image view and just close it and in between this image view I can just have the same code like this so just copy the same code from here and paste it here so what I have done here inside the button element I have added first of all this graphic element and using this graphic element I can use the image view inside this graphic element to show my image right so I can use this so something like this which is same as we have done in the last element here and save your code and run it once again and you can see here the image is added to the button but if you can see the image size is its original size so it's not resized because we haven't provided any size to the image view yet so you can see here our image view has no element so to resize your image you need to give these two attributes to your image view element one is fit height and other is fit width okay so for example I will give the same fit height and fit width parameter and fit height is 50 for us and fit width is 100 right now okay so run the code once again and now you can see the image is resized and now it looks good on this button okay so same you can do for labels or if you have some other controls you can add images to those controls like this okay so if you have a label it will be the same code like this okay now for example you want to add an image from online source so instead of using this local resource you can also use here the online resource for example you have some image somewhere located on internet for example I have this image on my website and I can see here and I just need to use the URL just copy the URL go to your code and instead of using this local path you can just paste your resource path which is online so my picture is on the website easy online converter comm slash images slash logo 1 dot PNG right save the code and run it once again and now I can see this logo here on the button right so in this way also you can add images to your controls in JavaFX so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
