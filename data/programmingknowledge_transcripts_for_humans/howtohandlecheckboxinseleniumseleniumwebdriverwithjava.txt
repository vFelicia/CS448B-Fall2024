00:00 - hello everyone this is varsha and
00:02 - welcome to programming knowledge so
00:03 - today we're going to understand how to
00:05 - handle these check boxes in selenium
00:07 - webdriver
00:08 - so let's get started
00:15 - now check boxes are widely used on our
00:17 - web pages to offer multiple choices
00:20 - of an option to the user it is basically
00:22 - a gui that allows the user to make
00:25 - certain choices for the given options
00:27 - okay now the user may get a list of
00:29 - choices and the check box records the
00:31 - choices made by the user
00:33 - the user can select either single choice
00:35 - uh or multiple choices
00:37 - okay so the user can make single choices
00:39 - or multiple choices out of the given
00:41 - list
00:42 - depending on their requirement okay so
00:44 - first we will learn how to handle these
00:46 - check boxes
00:47 - and then we will learn how to validate
00:49 - them
00:50 - now the user will select the options
00:52 - according to their requirement
00:54 - but as a quality engineer when you are
00:56 - becoming a software tester
00:58 - what will you do with the with these
01:00 - choices you're going to validate these
01:01 - choices
01:02 - okay that's what your work is right as
01:04 - an automation tester
01:05 - you perform test cases right so how
01:08 - we're going to handle the checkbox that
01:10 - we're going to learn first
01:11 - and then we're going to perform some
01:12 - validations on the checkboxes
01:15 - okay so here uh we will understand the
01:17 - validation
01:18 - through three commands that is the is
01:20 - displayed
01:21 - is enabled and is selected we have
01:23 - covered these three commands in the
01:24 - previous tutorials
01:26 - and i have also explained the difference
01:29 - between these three
01:30 - commands okay so now uh this is the page
01:33 - that we're going to automate today
01:35 - here you can see we have the check boxes
01:38 - now you must be thinking how do we
01:39 - handle these check boxes right
01:41 - it's very easy simply just clicking on
01:44 - these check boxes
01:45 - it gets checked and if you click again
01:47 - it is unchecked right
01:48 - that's what we're going to do to handle
01:50 - these check boxes so just open your
01:52 - intelligent idea ide
01:54 - so here i have already created a
01:56 - selenium tutorial
01:57 - 18 java class in package com.tutorials
02:01 - of selenium
02:02 - and here we have written the three basic
02:04 - commands that we write in all the
02:06 - programs
02:07 - okay that is first launching the chrome
02:09 - browser to launch the chrome browser we
02:11 - write system.set property
02:13 - in which we involve the key that is the
02:16 - webdriver.com.driver and the value is
02:18 - the
02:18 - executable file next we have written web
02:21 - driver driver is equal to new chrome
02:23 - driver which launches the
02:24 - chrome browser now we have to navigate
02:27 - to the url
02:28 - through driver.get command this is the
02:30 - page that we're going to navigate to so
02:32 - i have copied this url in
02:34 - driver.getcommand
02:35 - and then we are maximizing the browser
02:38 - so let's just execute this
02:41 - i'll run this here you can see my chrome
02:44 - browser's launched
02:47 - it's maximized it's navigated and it's
02:50 - maximized okay
02:51 - so basically these three commands are
02:53 - working properly
02:55 - now let's handle the check
02:58 - boxes okay
03:02 - now to handle the check boxes generally
03:04 - what you do
03:05 - you just click on it right that's what
03:08 - we're going to do
03:09 - we're going to perform the click
03:10 - operation over here first let's inspect
03:12 - this
03:13 - i'll just go on selectors up and i'll
03:16 - just copy this relative x path
03:19 - i will write driver dot
03:22 - find element y dot x path
03:26 - and i'll specify the x path over here
03:32 - okay so i will let me store this in a uh
03:35 - web element
03:36 - type of a variable i'll name it as
03:39 - spokes
03:40 - because it's a sports checkbox okay now
03:43 - what operation do we need to perform
03:45 - over here
03:46 - we need to click this so i will write
03:49 - sports dot click command okay
03:52 - let us execute this okay so my chrome
03:55 - browser is launched
03:58 - it's navigated it's maximized
04:03 - and here you can see the spots is
04:05 - checked
04:07 - okay next again
04:10 - we will inspect this element that is the
04:13 - reading element checkbox
04:15 - here it is so i will copy the relative x
04:18 - path
04:20 - and again i will write web element i
04:23 - will
04:24 - write it as reading
04:27 - is equal to driver dot fine element
04:31 - by dot x path and i will specify the x
04:34 - path over here
04:35 - okay now what operation do i need to
04:38 - perform over here is
04:40 - click so i'll simply just click this i
04:43 - will give some time limit over here so
04:45 - that we can see the execution properly
04:49 - let me execute this again
04:53 - so you have my chrome brush is launched
04:56 - navigate and maximize and here you can
04:58 - see the sports is clicked
04:59 - the reading is also clicked okay
05:02 - so now the third web element so i'll
05:05 - write web element dot
05:07 - sorry web element and i will specify the
05:10 - variable over here as
05:11 - music is equal to driver dot find
05:14 - element by
05:15 - dot x path and
05:19 - i will just inspect this element
05:22 - and here it is so i will just copy this
05:25 - x path
05:26 - and i will paste it over here
05:32 - now what operation i need to perform
05:33 - over here is click operation right so i
05:35 - will just write music
05:36 - dot click
05:39 - let's specify some time over here so
05:42 - that
05:43 - we can see the execution properly
05:48 - i'll execute this so here
05:51 - my chrome browser is launched it's
05:54 - navigated
05:55 - it's maximized and here you can see
05:57 - sports is checked
05:58 - reading is checked music is also checked
06:02 - okay now while handling these check
06:05 - boxes
06:06 - that is check and uncheck right so we
06:08 - have learned how to check these check
06:09 - boxes
06:10 - let's learn how to uncheck them so if
06:12 - the check box is checked
06:14 - simply by clicking it again it will
06:16 - uncheck right so that's what we're going
06:17 - to perform it again
06:19 - so if we write uncheck so here i have
06:21 - written uncheck
06:22 - and what i'll do is i will click all
06:24 - these elements again so i'll just write
06:26 - spots dot
06:28 - click and then i will specify some time
06:32 - red dot sleep then again i'm going to
06:36 - write
06:40 - reading dot click and and then i will
06:43 - specify some time
06:46 - click and then i will specify some time
06:47 - over here sorry thread dot sleep
06:53 - again i'll write music dot click
06:56 - just by clicking them again i'm going to
06:59 - uncheck it okay
07:01 - so i'll write red dot
07:06 - sleep over here also
07:09 - now why i'm re writing thread dot sleep
07:11 - is because i want to see the execution
07:14 - of the
07:14 - code properly okay so i am giving a
07:16 - waiting time over here basically
07:19 - so let's execute this and my chrome
07:21 - browser is launched
07:23 - it's navigated it's maximized
07:26 - sports is checked reading is checked
07:30 - music is checked sports is unchecked
07:32 - reading is unchecked
07:33 - and music is unchecked okay so here we
07:36 - have learnt
07:37 - how to handle our checkbox so we can use
07:40 - the click operation to handle the check
07:42 - box if we click it once
07:44 - it will be checked if we click it again
07:46 - it is unchecked okay
07:47 - now let's learn the validation part
07:51 - now in validation i have explained three
07:54 - commands in the previous tutorials
07:56 - so if you have seen all the tutorials
07:58 - before i have also explained the
08:00 - difference between is selected is
08:01 - enabled
08:02 - and is displayed okay so these are the
08:06 - three commands that we're going to use
08:07 - for validation
08:08 - first is display that is it returns true
08:11 - or false
08:12 - if the element is
08:15 - is displayed
08:22 - then we have the is selected then we
08:24 - have the
08:25 - is selected which returns true or false
08:28 - if the element is
08:31 - selected okay
08:35 - and next is is enabled so uh these three
08:39 - function returns boolean values that is
08:41 - true or false
08:42 - so returns true or false if the element
08:46 - is enabled okay
08:50 - so these are the three commands for
08:52 - validation
08:54 - and your let's validate it
08:58 - so first uh i have explained how to
09:01 - handle it so first we are clicking the
09:03 - element like over here we are writing
09:04 - sports dot click so it is clicked
09:07 - okay next we are unchecking it so it is
09:09 - clicked again it's unchecked
09:11 - now here i'll first use the
09:14 - is displayed okay
09:18 - i'll just write spots
09:22 - dot is displayed
09:25 - okay and i'll store this in a boolean
09:29 - type of a variable
09:33 - so boolean bowl 1 is equal to sports dot
09:36 - is displayed and we're going to print
09:39 - this
09:41 - now if this boolean variable is
09:43 - displayed okay
09:45 - now if this bool one comes true and if
09:47 - it is displayed it is true
09:51 - then we're going to write sports dot
09:53 - click
09:54 - okay let's execute this
09:59 - since it will show true because the
10:00 - element is displayed on the web page
10:02 - okay here my chrome browser's launched
10:07 - it's maximized and you can see sports is
10:09 - selected reading is selected music is
10:11 - selected
10:12 - sports is unselected reading is
10:14 - unselected and music is also unselected
10:17 - and again this post is selected the
10:19 - reason behind that is because the
10:20 - boolean value is printing true
10:22 - and since we have given a condition over
10:24 - here if the boolean value is true
10:26 - the spots will be clicked okay
10:29 - similarly let's go for
10:32 - is selected
10:36 - okay so your if i write boolean
10:40 - volt2 is equal to let's go for reading
10:43 - dot
10:45 - it's selected
10:49 - and next i'm going to write
10:53 - system.out.println and i'm going to
10:54 - print this
10:56 - value okay
10:59 - now let me give a condition now if
11:01 - boolean 2
11:03 - is equal to is equal equal to false
11:06 - now if it is false if it is not selected
11:10 - then we're going to write reading dot
11:14 - click okay now let's execute this
11:18 - okay so my chrome browser is launched
11:21 - it's navigated
11:23 - it's maximized
11:27 - and you can see his post is clicked
11:29 - reading is clicked
11:30 - music is clicked sports is unclicked
11:33 - reading is unclicked and music is also
11:35 - unclicked
11:37 - and again this post is clicked and the
11:38 - reading is also click the reason why it
11:40 - is clicked because i have given
11:42 - over here the condition is like bool two
11:44 - is equal equal to false and here the
11:46 - output for
11:47 - uh when we are writing reading dot is
11:49 - selected the output is false why
11:51 - because once we clicked it and after
11:54 - that
11:54 - again we are unchecking it right so if
11:56 - selected retrieves false if the element
11:59 - is not selected
12:00 - so here the element is not selected at
12:02 - this point of time so the
12:04 - value of bulldo is false and since it
12:07 - falls then it's clicking it again
12:09 - okay now let's let's go for is enabled
12:14 - now again i'll write boolean bool 3 is
12:18 - equal to
12:20 - music dot is enabled
12:24 - okay next we're going to print it so
12:27 - i'll write
12:29 - p and here again i will give a condition
12:33 - condition will be if o 3
12:36 - is equal equal to true
12:41 - if the value is true then music
12:45 - dot click just click the music
12:49 - checkbox so let's execute this
12:52 - okay so my chrome browser is launched
12:55 - it's maximized and here sports is
12:57 - clicked
12:58 - reading is clicked music is clicked
13:01 - sports is unchecked reading is unchecked
13:02 - and music is also unchecked
13:04 - and then again the spouse is checked
13:06 - reading is checked and the music is also
13:08 - checked the music is checked because the
13:11 - value of
13:11 - uh is enabled is true okay and i have
13:15 - given the condition over here as both 3
13:17 - is equal equal to 3
13:18 - so boot 3 is equal equal to true so
13:20 - that's the reason why it's clicking the
13:22 - music element
13:25 - so here we have learned how to handle
13:27 - the check boxes
13:28 - and here we have learned how to validate
13:30 - these check boxes okay
13:32 - so uh this is it for this video i hope
13:35 - that you learned something new
13:37 - so try these programs on your own and if
13:38 - you face any problem
13:40 - you can check out the uh github link
13:43 - that is given in the description
13:45 - uh also if you have any questions or any
13:47 - feedback use the comment section below
13:49 - in the next video we will learn about
13:51 - the radio buttons and
13:53 - join me in this video series and let's
13:55 - explore the automation testing and if
13:56 - you like this video
13:58 - hit the like button and also don't
13:59 - forget to subscribe our channel
14:01 - and ring that bell icon so that you
14:03 - don't miss the next video thanks for
14:04 - watching this video and i will see you
14:06 - in the next one

hello everyone this is varsha and welcome to programming knowledge so today we're going to understand how to handle these check boxes in selenium webdriver so let's get started now check boxes are widely used on our web pages to offer multiple choices of an option to the user it is basically a gui that allows the user to make certain choices for the given options okay now the user may get a

of the given list depending on their requirement okay so first we will learn how to handle these check boxes and then we will learn how to validate them now the user will select the options according to their requirement but as a quality engineer when you are becoming a software tester what will you do with the with these choices you're going to validate these choices okay that's what your work is right as an automation tester you perform test cases right so how we're going to handle the checkbox that we're going to learn first and then we're going to perform some validations on the checkboxes okay so here uh we will understand the validation through three commands that is the is displayed is enabled and is selected we have covered these three commands in the previous tutorials and i have also explained the difference between these three commands okay so now uh this is the page that we're going to automate today here you can see we have the check boxes now you must be thinking how do we handle these check boxes right it's very easy simply just clicking on these check boxes it gets checked and if you click again it is unchecked right that's what we're going to do to handle these check boxes so just open your intelligent idea ide so here i have already created a selenium tutorial 18 java class in package com.tutorials of selenium and here we have written the three basic commands that we write in all the programs okay that is first launching the chrome browser to launch the chrome browser we write system.set property in which we involve the key that is the webdriver.com.driver and the value is the executable file next we have written web driver driver is equal to new chrome driver which launches the chrome browser now we have to navigate to the url through driver.get command this is the page that we're going to navigate to so i have copied this url in driver.getcommand and then we are maximizing the browser so let's just execute this i'll run this here you can see my chrome browser's launched it's maximized it's navigated and it's maximized okay so basically these three commands are working properly now let's handle the check boxes okay now to handle the check boxes generally what you do you just click on it right that's what we're going to do we're going to perform the click operation over here first let's inspect this i'll just go on selectors up and i'll just copy this relative x path i will write driver dot find element y dot x path and i'll specify the x path over here okay so i will let me store this in a uh web element type of a variable i'll name it as spokes because it's a sports checkbox okay now what operation do we need to perform over here we need to click this so i will write sports dot click command okay let us execute this okay so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the spots is checked okay next again we will inspect this element that is the reading element checkbox here it is so i will copy the relative x path and again i will write web element i will write it as reading is equal to driver dot fine element by dot x path and i will specify the x path over here okay now what operation do i need to perform over here is click so i'll simply just click this i will give some time limit over here so that we can see the execution properly let me execute this again so you have my chrome brush is launched navigate and maximize and here you can see the sports is clicked the reading is also clicked okay so now the third web element so i'll write web element dot sorry web element and i will specify the variable over here as music is equal to driver dot find element by dot x path and i will just inspect this element and here it is so i will just copy this x path and i will paste it over here now what operation i need to perform over here is click operation right so i will just write music dot click let's specify some time over here so that we can see the execution properly i'll execute this so here my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see sports is checked reading is checked music is also checked okay now while handling these check boxes that is check and uncheck right so we have learned how to check these check boxes let's learn how to uncheck them so if the check box is checked simply by clicking it again it will uncheck right so that's what we're going to perform it again so if we write uncheck so here i have written uncheck and what i'll do is i will click all these elements again so i'll just write spots dot click and then i will specify some time red dot sleep then again i'm going to write reading dot click and and then i will specify some time click and then i will specify some time over here sorry thread dot sleep again i'll write music dot click just by clicking them again i'm going to uncheck it okay so i'll write red dot sleep over here also now why i'm re writing thread dot sleep is because i want to see the execution of the code properly okay so i am giving a waiting time over here basically so let's execute this and my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized sports is checked reading is checked music is checked sports is unchecked reading is unchecked and music is unchecked okay so here we have learnt how to handle our checkbox so we can use the click operation to handle the check box if we click it once it will be checked if we click it again it is unchecked okay now let's learn the validation part now in validation i have explained three commands in the previous tutorials so if you have seen all the tutorials before i have also explained the difference between is selected is enabled and is displayed okay so these are the three commands that we're going to use for validation first is display that is it returns true or false if the element is is displayed then we have the is selected then we have the is selected which returns true or false if the element is selected okay and next is is enabled so uh these three function returns boolean values that is true or false so returns true or false if the element is enabled okay so these are the three commands for validation and your let's validate it so first uh i have explained how to handle it so first we are clicking the element like over here we are writing sports dot click so it is clicked okay next we are unchecking it so it is clicked again it's unchecked now here i'll first use the is displayed okay i'll just write spots dot is displayed okay and i'll store this in a boolean type of a variable so boolean bowl 1 is equal to sports dot is displayed and we're going to print this now if this boolean variable is displayed okay now if this bool one comes true and if it is displayed it is true then we're going to write sports dot click okay let's execute this since it will show true because the element is displayed on the web page okay here my chrome browser's launched it's maximized and you can see sports is selected reading is selected music is selected sports is unselected reading is unselected and music is also unselected and again this post is selected the reason behind that is because the boolean value is printing true and since we have given a condition over here if the boolean value is true the spots will be clicked okay similarly let's go for is selected okay so your if i write boolean volt2 is equal to let's go for reading dot it's selected and next i'm going to write system.out.println and i'm going to print this value okay now let me give a condition now if boolean 2 is equal to is equal equal to false now if it is false if it is not selected then we're going to write reading dot click okay now let's execute this okay so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and you can see his post is clicked reading is clicked music is clicked sports is unclicked reading is unclicked and music is also unclicked and again this post is clicked and the reading is also click the reason why it is clicked because i have given over here the condition is like bool two is equal equal to false and here the output for uh when we are writing reading dot is selected the output is false why because once we clicked it and after that again we are unchecking it right so if selected retrieves false if the element is not selected so here the element is not selected at this point of time so the value of bulldo is false and since it falls then it's clicking it again okay now let's let's go for is enabled now again i'll write boolean bool 3 is equal to music dot is enabled okay next we're going to print it so i'll write p and here again i will give a condition condition will be if o 3 is equal equal to true if the value is true then music dot click just click the music checkbox so let's execute this okay so my chrome browser is launched it's maximized and here sports is clicked reading is clicked music is clicked sports is unchecked reading is unchecked and music is also unchecked and then again the spouse is checked reading is checked and the music is also checked the music is checked because the value of uh is enabled is true okay and i have given the condition over here as both 3 is equal equal to 3 so boot 3 is equal equal to true so that's the reason why it's clicking the music element so here we have learned how to handle the check boxes and here we have learned how to validate these check boxes okay so uh this is it for this video i hope that you learned something new so try these programs on your own and if you face any problem you can check out the uh github link that is given in the description uh also if you have any questions or any feedback use the comment section below in the next video we will learn about the radio buttons and join me in this video series and let's explore the automation testing and if you like this video hit the like button and also don't forget
