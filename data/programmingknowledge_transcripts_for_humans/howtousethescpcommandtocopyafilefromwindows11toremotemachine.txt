00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can transfer files between
00:04 - your windows 11 operating system and a
00:08 - remote server so let's say you have a
00:12 - Linux machine which is running remotely
00:16 - and you want to transfer file from your
00:20 - Windows operating system to that machine
00:23 - or if you want to transfer file from
00:26 - your remote machine to your Windows
00:28 - operating system how you can do it using
00:32 - SCP command SCP stands for secure copy
00:36 - protocol and it's a protocol which is
00:39 - popularly used to copy your files
00:43 - between two different operating systems
00:47 - so now Windows also supports SCP
00:51 - commands by default so when you open
00:54 - Powershell on your Windows operating
00:56 - systems let me open the Powershell
00:59 - command line utility just search for
01:02 - Powershell and it's going to open this
01:04 - kind of
01:06 - or terminal and let me open
01:09 - a remote machine so let's say this is my
01:13 - remote machine on this machine I have
01:16 - open SSH server running and this machine
01:20 - also supports SCP commands right so the
01:25 - only thing which you need to transfer
01:28 - files between your windows 11 operating
01:31 - system and your remote operating system
01:34 - is the IP address of your remote
01:37 - operating system so I need to know the
01:40 - IP address of my remote machine and the
01:43 - username of your remote machine and you
01:47 - should have the password for logging
01:51 - into your remote machine if it requires
01:54 - some kind of password to transfer those
01:57 - files right
01:59 - so this is my remote machine on the
02:02 - right hand side this is the Powershell
02:04 - which is available on Windows 11. if you
02:09 - run SCP command on this Powershell and
02:12 - then press enter and if you see this
02:15 - kind of usage uh
02:18 - help output then the windows supports
02:22 - SCP so as I said it comes by default
02:26 - with Powershell on your windows 11
02:29 - operating system
02:30 - now to know the IP address of the remote
02:34 - machine on my remote machine I can just
02:37 - write if config it can be your Cloud
02:41 - remote machine so
02:44 - um the procedure will be same right now
02:46 - I'm just running this remote machine
02:48 - virtually
02:50 - um on VMware for example but this can be
02:55 - available on some Cloud platform for
03:00 - example AWS or
03:02 - Google Cloud platform right
03:06 - so this is the IP address right and
03:10 - username is code bind in my case it can
03:14 - be uh different in your case so you need
03:16 - to know the username and the IP address
03:19 - right
03:20 - now
03:21 - what files you want to copy so you need
03:24 - to go to the folder where your files are
03:28 - available so first let's try to transfer
03:31 - files from your windows 11 operating
03:33 - system to this remote machine right so
03:36 - you need to know the
03:38 - source and destination also so first of
03:41 - all let me just go to my
03:44 - pictures folder and here I have some
03:48 - pictures right so you can see there is
03:50 - this uh folder with some screenshots and
03:54 - then I have few different pictures here
03:56 - right and I want to transfer let's say
03:59 - first of all the sample one dot JPG file
04:03 - to my remote server so let me just do
04:08 - that so let me create a new directory on
04:10 - my remote server so I'm going to just
04:12 - write mkdir and then I will just name my
04:15 - uh
04:16 - folder as Windows right and then I'm
04:19 - going to see the into windows so as you
04:23 - can see there is nothing in this Windows
04:26 - folder
04:27 - so now I want to copy the sample1.jpg
04:30 - file on this remote machine from my
04:33 - Windows operating system so I can write
04:35 - SCP then your file name which you want
04:39 - to copy then write the name of your file
04:41 - so my file name is sample one dot jpg
04:46 - and then you need to write the remote
04:50 - server destination so first of all you
04:54 - need to write the username so just write
04:57 - username first so code bind is the
05:00 - username at the rate IP address so IP
05:03 - address is this one in my case you need
05:06 - to know the IP address of your remote
05:08 - machine in your case also so
05:12 - [Music]
05:15 - 192.168.152.128 in my case right now
05:18 - after the IP address just give this
05:21 - colon here and then the path where you
05:26 - want to transfer your file on your
05:28 - remote machine so the path is this one
05:31 - so PWD I want to transfer the file to
05:35 - this path home forward slash code bind
05:38 - forward slash Windows right so just give
05:41 - the same path here
05:42 - home forward slash code bind in my case
05:47 - and then
05:49 - Windows okay so give the full path of
05:53 - your destination
05:54 - so basically we are trying to connect to
05:57 - our remote server using username and
06:00 - password and then we are giving the path
06:03 - of the destination so this is the source
06:07 - which we want to copy to the remote
06:10 - destination which is this path here
06:13 - let me just press enter
06:15 - and then it's going to ask you for your
06:18 - remote machine password so this machine
06:20 - have some login password right so give
06:23 - that password here I'm going to give
06:26 - that password and then press enter and
06:28 - then this file will be transferred so
06:31 - now when I see here on my remote machine
06:34 - when I do LS
06:36 - this sample one dot JPG file is
06:39 - available right
06:41 - now if you want to transfer multiple
06:43 - files then you just need to give the
06:47 - name of multiple files so I have already
06:50 - given sample one dot jpg for example I
06:54 - want to also transfer sample 2.jpg right
06:58 - so I'm going to just write sample to dot
07:01 - PNG
07:03 - so you can see the extension of sample 2
07:06 - is PNG so I can do that once again and
07:10 - then once again I'm going to press enter
07:12 - once again provide the password and this
07:16 - time both files are transferred and when
07:19 - I do LS I can see both files here now
07:22 - let's say you want to transfer a
07:23 - directory instead of files you want to
07:26 - transfer directory so this is a
07:29 - screenshot short directory in my
07:31 - pictures folder which contains some
07:33 - images so I can just give this command
07:37 - instead of writing this SCP and then
07:41 - writing the file name so I can give the
07:44 - directory name which is screenshots in
07:47 - my case so Powershell adds these dot
07:51 - backslash you don't need that so just
07:54 - give the name of your directory as I
07:56 - have given here and because this
08:00 - directory contains multiple files you
08:02 - need to give a flag which is hyphen R
08:05 - hyphen R stands for recursive copying
08:10 - for example so because we want to
08:12 - transfer all the files from this
08:14 - directory that's why we need to give
08:16 - this hyphen R flag here okay so let me
08:20 - just press enter once again give my
08:22 - password once again and then press enter
08:25 - and you can see all the files inside my
08:29 - uh screenshot directory has been copied
08:32 - to my remote server so when I do LS here
08:36 - I can see this screenshot directory
08:39 - which is created here when I go to this
08:42 - screenshot directory I can see all the
08:46 - files which are copied so you can see
08:49 - all these files are copied to my remote
08:53 - server okay
08:54 - so this is how you can copy from your
08:57 - Windows operating system to your remote
08:59 - machine
09:00 - now if you want to transfer from your
09:02 - remote machine to your Windows operating
09:05 - system the procedure is also simple for
09:09 - that
09:10 - so let me go back and on my remote
09:13 - machine let me clear the terminal let me
09:16 - do LS and on my remote machine let me
09:18 - create a files so what I'm going to do
09:20 - is I'm going to just write Echo and then
09:25 - I'm going to just write World here and
09:28 - then I'm going to just pipe the output
09:30 - to some file test dot txt for example
09:34 - right and then I'm going to just press
09:36 - enter basically this command is going to
09:39 - create a test.txt file with this text
09:43 - inside it so when I just write cat
09:48 - test dot txt it has this text here right
09:52 - I want to transfer this test.txt from my
09:56 - remote machine to my windows 11
10:00 - operating system
10:02 - so to do that let me just clear the
10:05 - terminal here also and let me show the
10:08 - files inside my pictures directory you
10:12 - can see there is no test.txt here so in
10:15 - order to copy this
10:16 - the command is similar so here
10:21 - after SCP you need to write the
10:25 - source and then space the destination
10:30 - right so first when we were copying from
10:33 - Windows 11 The Source was these
10:36 - directories or files right now if you
10:39 - want to copy from your remote server
10:41 - Source becomes our remote server
10:44 - destination which is this one right so
10:47 - first you need to give code bind at the
10:49 - rate IP address then the destination
10:53 - and then forward slash
10:56 - the name of your file which is test dot
10:59 - txt right and then destination becomes
11:03 - whatever folder
11:05 - in your local computer you want to uh
11:09 - copy this file to right so let's say I
11:12 - want to copy this file to this current
11:14 - folder itself which is the pictures
11:17 - folder I can just give dot here so just
11:19 - write dot here and then press enter and
11:22 - give password once again
11:24 - then your file will be copied from your
11:28 - remote server to the current directory
11:31 - in which you are currently present in so
11:33 - when I do LS once again I can see this
11:37 - test.txt file
11:39 - and when I will open this file for for
11:42 - example when I go to my pictures folder
11:44 - this file is there when I open this it
11:47 - has hello world inside it right so this
11:50 - is how you can copy from your remote
11:52 - machine to your local machine right
11:57 - so this is how you can transfer files
12:00 - and folders between your windows 11
12:03 - operating system and your remote server
12:06 - I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
12:09 - see you in the next video

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can transfer files between your windows 11 operating system and a remote server so let's say you have a Linux machine which is running remotely and you want to transfer file from your Windows operating system to that machine or if you want to transfer file from your remote machine to your Windows operating system how you can do it using SCP command SCP stands for secure copy protocol and it's a protocol which is popularly used to copy your files between two different operating systems so now Windows also supports SCP commands by default

windows supports SCP so as I said it comes by default with Powershell on your windows 11 operating system now to know the IP address of the remote machine on my remote machine I can just write if config it can be your Cloud remote machine so um the procedure will be same right now I'm just running this remote machine virtually um on VMware for example but this can be available on some Cloud platform for example AWS or Google Cloud platform right so this is the IP address right and username is code bind in my case it can be uh different in your case so you need to know the username and the IP address right now what files you want to copy so you need to go to the folder where your files are available so first let's try to transfer files from your windows 11 operating system to this remote machine right so you need to know the source and destination also so first of all let me just go to my pictures folder and here I have some pictures right so you can see there is this uh folder with some screenshots and then I have few different pictures here right and I want to transfer let's say first of all the sample one dot JPG file to my remote server so let me just do that so let me create a new directory on my remote server so I'm going to just write mkdir and then I will just name my uh folder as Windows right and then I'm going to see the into windows so as you can see there is nothing in this Windows folder so now I want to copy the sample1.jpg file on this remote machine from my Windows operating system so I can write SCP then your file name which you want to copy then write the name of your file so my file name is sample one dot jpg and then you need to write the remote server destination so first of all you need to write the username so just write username first so code bind is the username at the rate IP address so IP address is this one in my case you need to know the IP address of your remote machine in your case also so 192.168.152.128 in my case right now after the IP address just give this colon here and then the path where you want to transfer your file on your remote machine so the path is this one so PWD I want to transfer the file to this path home forward slash code bind forward slash Windows right so just give the same path here home forward slash code bind in my case and then Windows okay so give the full path of your destination so basically we are trying to connect to our remote server using username and password and then we are giving the path of the destination so this is the source which we want to copy to the remote

going to just write sample to dot PNG so you can see the extension of sample 2 is PNG so I can do that once again and then once again I'm going to press enter once again provide the password and this time both files are transferred and when I do LS I can see both files here now let's say you want to transfer a directory instead of files you want to transfer directory so this is a screenshot short directory in my pictures folder which contains some images so I can just give this command instead of writing this SCP and then writing the file name so I can give the directory name which is screenshots in my case so Powershell adds these dot backslash you don't need that so just give the name of your directory as I have given here and because this directory contains multiple files you need to give a flag which is hyphen R hyphen R stands for recursive copying for example so because we want to transfer all the files from this directory that's why we need to give this hyphen R flag here okay so let me just press enter once again give my password once again and then press enter and you can see all the files inside my uh screenshot directory has been copied to my remote server so when I do LS here I can see this screenshot directory which is created here when I go to this screenshot directory I can see all the files which are copied so you can see all these files are copied to my remote server okay so this is how you can copy from your Windows operating system to your remote machine now if you want to transfer from your remote machine to your Windows operating system the
