00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:06 - init method in Python and how to use a
00:09 - keyboard called self in Python so I will
00:13 - continue with the class which I have
00:16 - created in the last video and this was
00:19 - the class which we have created and we
00:21 - have used this special keyword passed
00:24 - there and pass we were using to create
00:27 - an empty class now I'm going to remove
00:31 - this pass and I'm going to add a method
00:35 - called init here so I'm going to just
00:38 - write def and then underscore underscore
00:41 - in it and then press enter and you can
00:45 - see this init method is created here so
00:49 - this is like a normal method with double
00:53 - underscore in front and back of this
00:56 - init keyword and you will also see the
00:59 - self keyword is already added as the
01:02 - first argument of this method now this
01:07 - init method serves as a constructor for
01:10 - the class so usually it is used to
01:14 - initialize some attributes or some
01:18 - functions because this is the first
01:21 - method which will be called when you
01:24 - create an instance of a class so here we
01:28 - are creating an instance of a class
01:30 - and this init method will be the first
01:33 - method which will be called when this
01:36 - object or instance will be created so
01:40 - let's check what I am saying so let's
01:42 - say I want to print inside this init
01:45 - method that the underscore underscore
01:49 - init underscore underscore is called and
01:53 - let me run this code so I will change
01:56 - this to car and then run this code and
01:59 - now when I see this result you will see
02:02 - this line is called three times because
02:06 - we have created three instance from the
02:09 - same class okay so every time this
02:12 - instance is created
02:14 - this print is called and that's why this
02:18 - line is printed three times and
02:21 - everything else will be printed after
02:24 - that whatever we were printing for
02:26 - example speed or color of the car will
02:29 - be printed after that now one important
02:32 - thing to notice here is I said in it
02:35 - serves as a constructor it's not a
02:38 - constructor although it would be
02:41 - tempting to call this init method as a
02:43 - constructor actually it's not a
02:46 - constructor but it behaves like a
02:49 - constructor because in it is the closest
02:53 - thing we are going to get in Python to a
02:56 - constructor because it is the first
02:59 - method which is called whenever an
03:02 - instance is created now if you are
03:05 - familiar with other object-oriented
03:07 - programming languages like Java and C++
03:11 - there is a destructor also in those kind
03:15 - of languages with classes now Python
03:18 - doesn't have any destructor because
03:21 - python has an automatic garbage
03:24 - collections so you don't need a
03:26 - destructor in Python because python will
03:29 - take care of anything which should be
03:32 - taken care of now as I said usually init
03:35 - method is used to initialize something
03:38 - so instead of initializing the value of
03:42 - speed and initializing the value of
03:45 - color let me just comment this code
03:48 - first of all so I'm going to select
03:50 - whatever I want to comment and then I
03:52 - can press control forward slash to
03:56 - comment all the line you can also go to
03:58 - code and then use this option which says
04:01 - comment with line comment and you can
04:04 - see the shortcut for that ctrl + /o K so
04:09 - this is going to comment your lines of
04:11 - code and now I want to use the speed as
04:15 - the initialization value so after the
04:18 - self keyword I can give the next
04:22 - parameter which is speed here and then
04:25 - the third parameter
04:27 - is the color here and now to print the
04:30 - value of speed and color I can use once
04:33 - again print and then first of all I'm
04:36 - going to print the speed and then I'm
04:38 - going to print the color attribute and
04:43 - as soon as you do this and when you try
04:46 - to run this program it will give you an
04:48 - error so let me run the program and it
04:50 - will give me the error it says in it
04:53 - missing two required positional argument
04:57 - which is speed and color okay so once
05:00 - you create an init method and provide
05:04 - any arguments other than self self is
05:08 - automatically provided by Python
05:11 - whenever you create an instance of a
05:14 - class but other than self when you write
05:17 - for example speed and color arguments
05:20 - here you need to provide those argument
05:23 - at the initialization of your class so
05:27 - here first we will give the speed inside
05:30 - these parentheses for example 200 and
05:33 - then the color for example red here okay
05:38 - same we need to do for the other two
05:42 - instantiation of the car class so let me
05:46 - do it for the second instance and also
05:50 - for the third instance and now let's run
05:54 - the code once again and let's see what
05:57 - happens so now you can see everything
06:00 - works fine and no error is given to us
06:03 - and you will also see because this print
06:07 - is called first you can see the speed is
06:11 - printed first and then the color and
06:13 - then this line is printed after that and
06:16 - that means we will get the speed color
06:19 - and this line three times for every
06:23 - instance with different values whatever
06:26 - values you have provided for the
06:29 - instantiation of your car class now
06:31 - usually you provide these arguments
06:34 - because you want to initialize the value
06:37 - of speed so let's try to access the
06:40 - value or
06:41 - of the ford object speed and color so
06:45 - let me just uncomment this code and
06:47 - let's run this code and it will give us
06:50 - an error you can see this says that car
06:53 - object has no attribute called speed
06:56 - right so what is the error because we
07:00 - have provided these attribute speed and
07:03 - color but we haven't assigned these
07:05 - values to any attribute inside this car
07:09 - class earlier what we have done is we
07:12 - have assigned the speed value to a speed
07:16 - attribute and the color value to the
07:18 - color attribute but we have already
07:21 - commented those codes so how can we
07:23 - assign the speed and color to the car
07:26 - object so it turns out that you can use
07:30 - the self keyword and then using the self
07:34 - keyword you can assign the value to the
07:36 - current object so self is essentially
07:39 - the current object okay it's similar to
07:43 - using this in C++ or Java if you are
07:47 - familiar with those two languages so you
07:50 - use self dot and then the name of the
07:53 - attribute for example speed in our case
07:56 - is equal to whatever argument you
07:58 - provide for speed so we have provided
08:00 - the same argument which is speed itself
08:03 - once again I can use self to set the
08:07 - value of color here so self dot color is
08:11 - equal to color let me remove this
08:13 - semicolon because it's not required and
08:16 - now when I run this code you will see
08:19 - that there is no error now so because we
08:23 - have now used the self keyword to set
08:27 - the attributes of speed and color so we
08:30 - can easily access the values of the
08:33 - speed and color using any object of the
08:35 - car class so let me once again minimize
08:38 - this so now let's talk about the self
08:41 - keyword here so whenever you create a
08:44 - class the first argument of every method
08:47 - you need to provide this keyword self
08:50 - now it's not necessary to provide this
08:53 - same kevo
08:54 - which itself but it's a convention to
08:56 - write this self as the first parameter
08:59 - the first parameter can be for example
09:02 - ABC it doesn't matter but you need to
09:05 - use this ABC here also as self and it
09:10 - will be totally fine but it's a
09:12 - convention that we use the self keyword
09:15 - in order to indicate that this is the
09:18 - current object so every method you will
09:21 - create you need to give this self
09:23 - keyword as the first argument of your
09:27 - method inside at last now you may also
09:30 - observe that here when I am initializing
09:32 - this class instance I'm not providing
09:36 - any self keyword so even though in the
09:39 - init method I have provided three
09:42 - arguments I am only providing two
09:44 - arguments here so it turns out that you
09:47 - don't need to provide the first argument
09:49 - which is self it will be automatically
09:52 - be provided to your class so you just
09:55 - need to give the next argument whatever
09:59 - argument you give after the self so we
10:01 - have given speed and color after the
10:04 - self argument so we just need to provide
10:07 - those arguments after whatever you use
10:09 - after this keyword called the self so
10:12 - let's do the same thing with our second
10:14 - class which is the rectangle class and
10:16 - here also we have created this empty
10:19 - class so let's remove this pass keyword
10:22 - and instead of this pass keyword we will
10:24 - use this init method which is def
10:28 - underscore underscore init underscore
10:31 - underscore and here after the self we
10:34 - will provide the height as the second
10:37 - argument and the width as the third
10:41 - argument okay and then we are going to
10:45 - initialize the attributes height and
10:48 - width using this self keyword so self
10:50 - dot height is equal to height self dot
10:56 - width is equal to width okay so this is
11:00 - how you can initialize your attribute
11:03 - using this init method and now when you
11:07 - do this
11:07 - you don't need to initialize these
11:10 - values like this you can directly
11:13 - initialize this height and width using
11:16 - these parentheses let me provide these
11:19 - values let's say 20 and 60 for the first
11:23 - rectangle and let's say 50 and 40 for
11:27 - the second rectangle and when we run
11:30 - this code let me just change the file
11:33 - here and then run the code and you will
11:36 - see it will print the area once again
11:38 - here so this init method is used to
11:41 - initialize your attributes or whatever
11:44 - you want to initialize at the start of
11:47 - your class you will do all those
11:51 - initializations inside this init method
11:54 - so this is how you can use init method
11:57 - and self keyword in Python that's it for
12:00 - this video I will see you in the next
12:02 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to the next video on Python tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how to use init method in Python and how to use a keyboard called self in Python so I will continue with the class which I have created in the last video and this was the class which we have created and we have used this special keyword passed there and pass we were using to create an empty class now I'm going to remove this pass and I'm going to add a method called init here so I'm going to just write def and then underscore underscore in it and then press enter and you can see this

created this print is called and that's why this line is printed three times and everything else will be printed after that whatever we were printing for example speed or color of the car will be printed after that now one important thing to notice here is I said in it serves as a constructor it's not a constructor although it would be tempting to call this init method as a constructor

which is speed here and then the third parameter is the color here and now to print the value of speed and color I can use once again print and then first of all I'm going to print the speed and then I'm going to print the color attribute and as soon as you do this and when you try to run this program it will give you an error so let me run the program and it will give me the error it says in it

I am initializing this class instance I'm not providing any self keyword so even though in the init method I have provided three arguments I am only providing two arguments here so it turns out that you don't need to provide the first argument which is self it will be automatically be provided to your class so you just need to give the next argument whatever argument you give after the self so we
