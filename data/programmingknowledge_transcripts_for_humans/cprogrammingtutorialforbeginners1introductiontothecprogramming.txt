00:00 - see programming language is considered
00:02 - as the mother of all programming
00:04 - languages present in the software
00:06 - industry anywhere you go C programming
00:08 - language is the most basic and very
00:10 - important aspect which the recruiters
00:13 - are looking for hi this is jon from
00:15 - programming knowledge and welcome to
00:17 - this video tutorial series where you
00:19 - will learn how to go about programming
00:21 - in C language in this tutorial we will
00:24 - discuss mostly the important parts of C
00:27 - programming language so these are the
00:29 - topics that are included in our C
00:31 - programming language tutorial series so
00:34 - firstly we're going to discuss the
00:35 - history of C and then to be followed by
00:38 - the installation of C so I'm going to
00:40 - guide you through all the steps needed
00:42 - to start about programming in C
00:45 - programming language to be followed by
00:48 - data types and variables of course we're
00:49 - going to discuss the importance of data
00:51 - types and variables in C and to be
00:55 - followed by C tokens to be followed by
00:59 - preprocessor directives and of course
01:01 - we're going to learn the how to write
01:04 - our first program in C programming
01:05 - language and of course to be followed by
01:09 - control structures so as we all know if
01:11 - you are coming from other programming
01:14 - language you already have knowledge on
01:17 - control structures so we're going to
01:19 - discuss that right here and then of
01:21 - course loops we're going to discuss
01:24 - loops and then pointers and to be
01:27 - followed by functions and then we're
01:31 - going to learn about escape sequence in
01:34 - C and after that one will be the data
01:37 - structures and of course we're going to
01:41 - discuss strings followed by structures
01:44 - and Union to be followed by memory
01:47 - allocation and lastly is the sorting
01:50 - algorithms so we're going to discuss
01:52 - that also in this particular tutorial
01:54 - series so now let's talk about the
01:57 - history of C language so history of C
02:01 - language is interesting to know here we
02:04 - are going to discuss a brief history of
02:05 - the C language C programming language
02:08 - was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie
02:11 - at Bell Laboratories of
02:13 - TNT or American telephone and telegraph
02:17 - located in the USA Dennis Ritchie is
02:20 - known as the founder of the C language
02:22 - it was developed to overcome the
02:24 - problems of previous languages such as B
02:27 - dcpl and other languages initially C
02:31 - language was developed to be used in
02:32 - UNIX operating system it inherits many
02:35 - features of previous languages such as B
02:37 - and BCPL C was originally first
02:42 - implemented on the dec pdp-11 computer
02:45 - so pdp-11 is a series of 16-bit mini
02:49 - computers sold by Digital Equipment
02:51 - Corporation from 1970 into the 1990s C
02:56 - programming language is known for its
02:58 - flexibility and versatility allowing
03:01 - maximum control with minimal commands so
03:05 - now let's talk about the features of C
03:08 - language C programming language is the
03:11 - widely used language and it provides
03:13 - many features that we're going to
03:15 - discuss in this particular video number
03:18 - one it is simple C is a simple language
03:21 - in a sense that it provides a structured
03:24 - approach to break the problems in two
03:26 - parts number two machine independent or
03:30 - portable so unlike assembly language C
03:34 - programs can be executed on different
03:36 - machines with some machine specific
03:38 - changes therefore C is a machine
03:41 - independent language three mid-level
03:45 - programming language although C is
03:47 - intended to do a low-level programming
03:49 - it is used to develop system
03:51 - applications such as kernel driver and
03:53 - others it also supports the features of
03:56 - high programming language that is why it
03:58 - is known as mid-level language number
04:02 - four structured programming language C
04:05 - is a structured programming language in
04:07 - a sense that we can break the program
04:08 - into parts using functions so it is easy
04:11 - to understand and modify functions also
04:14 - provide code reusability number five
04:18 - rich library C language provides a lot
04:21 - of built-in functions that make the
04:23 - development faster number six
04:26 - memory management it supports the
04:29 - feature of dynamic memory allocation in
04:31 - C language we can freely allocate the
04:34 - memory at any time by calling the free
04:36 - function number seven speed the
04:40 - compilation time and execution time of C
04:42 - language is fast since there are lesser
04:45 - built-in functions and hence the lesser
04:48 - overhead number eight pointer C provides
04:52 - the feature pointers we can directly
04:54 - interact with the memory by using the
04:56 - pointers we can use pointers for memory
04:59 - structures functions array and others
05:03 - number nine recursion in C we can call
05:08 - the function within the function it
05:10 - provides code reusability for every
05:13 - function recursion enables us to use the
05:16 - approach of backtracking number ten
05:19 - extensible C language is extensible
05:23 - because it can easily adapt new features
05:27 - now that we're done talking about the
05:29 - features and history of C programming
05:31 - language we can now go to the
05:33 - installation of see in Windows operating
05:36 - system now there are multiple ways we
05:39 - can install C programming language in
05:42 - our computer system so the most basic
05:44 - way is to install twrp you see in our
05:47 - computer system also if you are familiar
05:50 - with the Eclipse IDE you can directly
05:54 - download GCC compiler and include C
05:58 - nature to our Eclipse IDE and continue
06:01 - working on executing C programs as I've
06:04 - said guys there are multiple ways of
06:06 - installing C program into our computer
06:08 - system and one way of doing it is to
06:11 - install Toby's turbo C++ or you can use
06:14 - the Eclipse IDE and then include the GCC
06:18 - compiler and also you can do it online
06:21 - there are more other many platforms that
06:23 - can help you develop C program online
06:26 - and then one way of doing it also is
06:29 - also installing code blocks so if you go
06:34 - to your browser and try to search for
06:36 - code blocks and then this is the first
06:39 - link that you
06:40 - we'll get and it will redirect you to
06:44 - code blocks that org and code blocks is
06:47 - an IDE that will help us to write
06:50 - programs especially for C C++ and
06:55 - Fortran ID the good thing about code
06:57 - blocks is it is a cross-platform
07:00 - and open source meaning we can use it
07:03 - freely to develop our C programs so the
07:07 - first thing that we're gonna need guys
07:08 - is to download this of course in order
07:11 - for us to install and start writing or C
07:14 - programs so there are two options here
07:18 - we can download it from this link and of
07:21 - course we can also donate it from this
07:23 - particular link here so let's just try
07:27 - this one the upper one and then there
07:31 - are options to download the binary
07:33 - release we can download the source code
07:36 - and we can also retrieve source code
07:39 - from SVN okay the first thing that we're
07:42 - gonna need now is to download the binary
07:44 - release okay good click on that and here
07:48 - we can see that we can install it on
07:50 - Windows XP Vista Windows 7 Windows 8 and
07:54 - Windows 10 and we can install it also in
07:58 - Linux operating system be it 32 or
08:02 - 64-bit and also we can use it on Mac OSX
08:07 - and because we're using Windows
08:10 - operating system free now so let's just
08:12 - click on that and then here you can see
08:15 - all the options or all the links that we
08:19 - can download the code blocks we can
08:23 - download only the set up we can only or
08:26 - we can also download the nan admin no
08:30 - set up and then we can also code blocks
08:32 - with this meaning W setup so if you want
08:37 - you can download this particular one
08:39 - code blocks and then the current version
08:42 - is seventeen point child being W - set
08:45 - up that X is a and then we can download
08:48 - it from SourceForge
08:50 - or false hub so try
08:54 - and then let's just wait for the
08:57 - download to complete in order for us to
09:00 - install this particular IDE and then
09:02 - after installation of course we can
09:05 - write our first program in C programming
09:09 - language so currently it is 86 point 2
09:12 - MB and then we're just going to wait for
09:14 - a few seconds for the download to
09:16 - complete and I think it won't take that
09:20 - much time and we're halfway there there
09:25 - you go
09:26 - so we can just install this particular
09:28 - IDE so click on this and yes next I
09:45 - agree and then we don't want to touch
09:50 - anything here if you are an advanced
09:53 - user you can try to modify the
09:56 - installation but for now since we're
09:57 - beginners let's try to click on next and
10:01 - then in so this is the destination
10:03 - folder and then install
10:17 - so there you go installation is complete
10:19 - so do you want to run code blocks now of
10:22 - course yes so GNU GCC compiler has been
10:31 - detected so that's okay and file
10:39 - associations we are being asked here if
10:42 - we want to associate C and C++ files for
10:45 - this particular IDE so yes associate
10:49 - code blocks with C or C++ files and then
10:52 - okay so there you have it we now have
10:54 - the installation of code blocks and in
10:57 - the next video guys we're going to start
10:59 - writing our first C program so thank you
11:02 - for watching and see you in the next
11:03 - video thanks

see programming language is considered as the mother of all programming languages present in the software industry anywhere you go C programming language is the most basic and very important aspect which the recruiters are looking for hi this is jon from programming knowledge and welcome to this video tutorial series where you will learn how to go about programming in C language in this tutorial we will discuss mostly the important parts of C programming language so these are the topics that are included in our C programming language tutorial series so firstly we're going to discuss the history of C and then to be followed by the installation of C so I'm going to guide you through all the steps needed to start about programming in C programming language to be followed by data types and variables of course we're going to discuss the importance of data types and variables in C and to be followed by C tokens to be followed by preprocessor directives and of course we're going to
