00:13 - Java project in intellig idea
00:17 - IDE so first of all before installing
00:21 - intellig idea you need to have Oracle
00:25 - Java installed in open 2 because uh
00:29 - intell J idea IDE requires uh in Oracle
00:34 - Java installation on your open to

01:36 - versions or two additions one is
01:39 - Ultimate and one is community ultimate
01:42 - is more advanced and uh you know you can
01:46 - use this commercially to develop
01:48 - commercial um project uh in Java and
01:52 - other languages and other one is
01:55 - Community Edition which is free and open
01:58 - source and you can
02:00 - use this for learning purposes so I'm

02:26 - can right click and extract this folder
02:31 - and uh once this folder is extracted you
02:35 - will be able to run this intellig idea
02:40 - by going inside this folder so this
02:43 - folder is extracted I'm going to go
02:46 - inside this and inside this you will be
02:49 - able to see these folders and the folder
02:53 - which we require is bin and in here we
02:57 - will be able to see uh script called
03:03 - idea. sh okay so we need to run this uh
03:08 - shell script using terminal in order to
03:11 - uh install intell idea so what we are
03:15 - going to do is I'm going to open my
03:18 - terminal and I'm going to go to this um
03:23 - download
03:25 - directory and then uh

07:32 - name is and it's going to open all uh
07:37 - these files we are interested in Source
07:40 - folder because we are going to create
07:43 - our Java file inside this Source okay so
07:49 - what we can do is we can right click to
07:52 - this Source
07:57 - folder and we can just create a package
08:00 - for example
08:04 - for Java file so for example
08:09 - my pack for package
08:13 - name and inside this package we can uh
08:16 - create a new Java class so new Java
08:20 - class and give the name to your uh Java
08:23 - class for
08:24 - example my
08:28 - class and and click okay and it's going
08:32 - to create a new Java class for us in a
08:37 - file called my class. Java okay so this
08:44 - is uh the bare bone class for us and
08:47 - inside this we can uh write the code so
08:51 - inside this class we are going to create
08:53 - our main method so let's uh use uh very
08:58 - uh nice shortcut just write
09:01 - psvm here and give a
09:04 - tab and it's going to create a method
09:07 - for you main method for you right so
09:11 - inside this main method uh what I'm
09:13 - going to do is I'm going to print
09:14 - something so I will just write s out
09:19 - Tab and it's going to give me this code
09:23 - system.out.print line and inside this uh
09:26 - argument uh brackets we we can just
09:29 - write
09:32 - hello world okay and now we can run our
09:36 - program by going to build and we can
09:39 - make
09:40 - our program by clicking make module my
09:44 - first or make project anything you can
09:46 - choose and and now you can run your
09:50 - program by going to this Run tab and
09:53 - click this
09:55 - run option here and you can choose
09:59 - choose your class name my class and it's
10:03 - printing hello world here now after
10:08 - building or and running your program for
10:10 - the first time you will be able to see
10:12 - this uh green button here so whenever
10:14 - you edit your program for example I will
10:17 - just print hello world YouTube for
10:22 - example I edited uh this uh message and
10:25 - I can just click this uh run button so I
10:28 - can see this message hello world YouTube
10:31 - so in this way you can uh download and
10:33 - install intellig idea on your open to
10:36 - operating system and create your first
