With timestamps:

00:00 - today we are going to build a rails
00:01 - authentication app so let's build this
00:04 - so i have run this command rails new
00:06 - rail source app
00:07 - so this would create a rails or app your
00:10 - local machine
00:11 - so the next command you need to type is
00:13 - you need to find
00:15 - you need to move inside this rails new
00:17 - app new new auth app
00:19 - and uh like so
00:23 - this is like this is the command rails
00:25 - auth app so you need to define
00:27 - cd sales or app
00:30 - and you can move you have moved in this
00:32 - directory and you need to find
00:33 - code dot dot so this will open the vs
00:36 - code on your local machine
00:38 - so this is fine uh then you can click
00:41 - here and you click in rails terminal
00:43 - and then you can type real server
00:46 - and this would like most probably
00:50 - uh this would open the like
00:53 - this like this would be on your local
00:55 - host so
00:56 - then you can copy this link and
01:00 - you can copy this thing and then you can
01:03 - open chrome browser
01:06 - and then you can open the chrome browser
01:08 - and it's this url
01:10 - so this is how we have so
01:13 - so now the app is running on your
01:14 - browser so this is fine
01:16 - so we need to define few things before
01:18 - we start our application
01:20 - so you can close the server
01:24 - and you can close the server and it
01:26 - would ask you to terminate the job yes
01:28 - so we need to define the rails g
01:31 - controller
01:32 - so we need to define first we need to
01:35 - define
01:36 - very first thing what you need to do you
01:38 - need to move to your gem file
01:40 - and this is your gem file and you need
01:42 - to
01:43 - uncomment this thing so you need to
01:46 - uncomment this and then you need to type
01:49 - so we need decrypt to store the password
01:52 - in a digested form
01:53 - because we are building an
01:54 - authentication app and we cannot
01:56 - directly store the
01:57 - uh like be uh like user password in a
02:00 - raw form so we need to like
02:02 - basically uh store it in a digested form
02:05 - okay so then we need to define create a
02:09 - controller rails
02:10 - g controller
02:13 - and we need to find sessions
02:17 - okay so basically this is we need to
02:19 - define rails free controller session so
02:21 - this would create a session controller
02:23 - and in the same way
02:27 - uh we need to define
02:29 - [Music]
02:30 - we need to find a user controller
02:34 - and a user model okay so let's
02:37 - move this session and roller dot rb
02:41 - so this is class session controller and
02:43 - application controller
02:45 - and this is end so this is our accession
02:47 - controller and in the same way we define
02:49 - rails
02:50 - g controller
02:53 - users and this would create the user's
02:57 - controller
02:58 - so this is fine and
03:02 - we need to also define rails g model
03:09 - user and which has the email unique
03:13 - and a password in a digested form
03:20 - okay okay so this would create a user
03:24 - model in your
03:25 - machine and this is mine and then you
03:27 - need to type rails db
03:30 - migrate so then we have migrated the
03:33 - database
03:34 - so this looks perfectly fine and
03:38 - so this is fine so we would also have
03:41 - the usage controller
03:43 - this is here it is and we would also
03:45 - have the user model
03:48 - okay so so
03:51 - we need to define few things here
03:52 - validates
03:54 - email so we need to validate the email
03:58 - a few things that is presence
04:02 - presence is equal to true
04:07 - and uniqueness
04:12 - uniqueness is equal to true
04:17 - so this is how we do this we need to
04:19 - define validates
04:21 - email presence is going to be true and
04:22 - uniqueness is equal to true
04:24 - and let's open the console rails console
04:30 - and let's run few commands like
04:33 - we are sure that our model is being
04:34 - created or not so we need to define user
04:37 - dot connection
04:39 - so now it's fine so now let's define
04:42 - user and we have got a user ids integer
04:46 - email is string
04:47 - and a password type just is equal to
04:49 - string so
04:51 - basically this means we are storing the
04:52 - password in a string format but in an
04:54 - encrypted way that is a digested form
04:57 - okay so let's move to new file routes rv
05:02 - and let's create few resources here
05:05 - so we are defining resources because we
05:08 - are telling them that we
05:10 - are using those controllers in those
05:11 - routes because we need to define a map
05:13 - particular url to around so for that one
05:17 - we need to do we need to define
05:19 - resources
05:21 - and we need to find users
05:25 - and resources and we need to define
05:28 - sessions okay
05:32 - so this is how we do it and let's define
05:37 - get get method with sign up
05:43 - which says to
05:47 - users
05:51 - ash new and
05:54 - let's define this as as
05:59 - sign up so
06:03 - and for this we need to define get
06:06 - login okay this is not needed now right
06:09 - now so we can ignore this
06:11 - and let's this is not needed we can
06:13 - ignore this
06:15 - and let's move to this and we need to
06:18 - find the def
06:18 - new and let's end this method
06:22 - okay and we should also uh when we
06:24 - create more value the most probably we
06:26 - are going to create depth create and
06:28 - this and def destroy destroy
06:36 - and end and when we
06:39 - move to this
06:43 - views users and we create a file
06:47 - okay something wrong yeah new file
06:52 - and we need to define new.html.erb
06:56 - and let's define a page sign
06:59 - up so i hope this is fine and yeah so
07:03 - sign up is the page
07:04 - so let's see the flow first so we have a
07:07 - route short rb
07:08 - we say get sign up users new and as sign
07:11 - up
07:12 - and in here we define a signup method
07:14 - new
07:15 - and this has a like default statement of
07:18 - this
07:18 - render new okay so if you want to like
07:22 - have a good
07:22 - overview so this is a default statement
07:24 - it must be rendering so we can skip this
07:27 - as a practice we can skip this and it
07:29 - will definitely
07:30 - render the new.html.erb okay so let's
07:34 - run this
07:36 - and i hope the server is not running so
07:39 - let's exit this
07:42 - rails server
07:47 - and let's define sign up
07:53 - so we have like so it says rendered
07:56 - user.new.
07:58 - with layouts and let's see yeah the
08:00 - signup is there
08:02 - so this is the basic layout so in the
08:04 - same way
08:05 - a very quick we can do this we can also
08:08 - create a few things here
08:09 - also def new we can also create that new
08:13 - end dev create
08:16 - and we can end this method and def
08:19 - destroy
08:20 - so so this is the basic architecture so
08:25 - we are maintaining user model user
08:26 - controller and a session controller
08:28 - for our application so basically these
08:30 - things are needed so this will help you
08:32 - out to like maintain the application
08:35 - so then in the same way we can create
08:38 - few more routes as well
08:40 - so one is like sign up and another is
08:44 - sign in and one is also like login
08:47 - logout so we can maintain those routes
08:50 - and help us so next what we are going to
08:53 - do
08:53 - we are going to create a form here so
08:56 - basically
08:57 - those form is also obviously it is going
08:59 - to
09:00 - have like few things a registration form
09:04 - basically so we are going to register
09:05 - the user here so
09:07 - it will have a method a basically
09:10 - method which is going to be post okay
09:14 - so this is going to be post method and
09:17 - uh and we'll define the action here
09:20 - action is
09:21 - a way like it is being empty here so
09:24 - action is there and we need to define
09:26 - something
09:26 - for that okay so i'll catch in the next
09:28 - tutorial thank you for everyone for
09:30 - watching this thank you
09:34 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

today we are going to build a rails authentication app so let's build this so i have run this command rails new rail source app so this would create a rails or app your local machine so the next command you need to type is you need to find you need to move inside this rails new app new new auth app and uh like so this is like this is the command rails auth app so you need to define cd sales or app and you can move you have moved in this directory and you need to find code dot dot so this will open the vs code on your local machine so this is fine uh then you can click here and you click in rails terminal and then you can type real server and this would like most probably uh this would open the like this like this would be on your local host so then you can copy this link and you can copy this thing and then you can open chrome browser and then you can open the chrome browser and it's this url so this is how we have so so now the app is running on your browser so this is fine so we need to define few things before we start our application so you can close the server and you can close the server and it would ask you to terminate the job yes so we need to define the rails g controller so we need to define first we need to define very first thing what you need to do you need to move to your gem file and this is your gem file and you need to uncomment this thing so you need to uncomment this and then you need to type so we need decrypt to store the password in a digested form because we are building an authentication app and we cannot directly store the uh like be uh like user password in a raw form so we need to like basically uh store it in a digested form okay so then we need to define create a controller rails g controller and we need to find sessions okay so basically this is we need to define rails free controller session so this would create a session controller and in the same way uh we need to define we need to find a user controller and a user model okay so let's move this session and roller dot rb so this is class session controller and application controller and this is end so this is our accession controller and in the same way we define rails g controller users and this would create the user's controller so this is fine and we need to also define rails g model user and which has the email unique and a password in a digested form okay okay so this would create a user model in your machine and this is mine and then you need to type rails db migrate so then we have migrated the database so this looks perfectly fine and so this is fine so we would also have the usage controller this is here it is and we would also have the user model okay so so we need to define few things here validates email so we need to validate the email a few things that is presence presence is equal to true and uniqueness uniqueness is equal to true so this is how we do this we need to define validates email presence is going to be true and uniqueness is equal to true and let's open the console rails console and let's run few commands like we are sure that our model is being created or not so we need to define user dot connection so now it's fine so now let's define user and we have got a user ids integer email is string and a password type just is equal to string so basically this means we are storing the password in a string format but in an encrypted way that is a digested form okay so let's move to new file routes rv and let's create few resources here so we are defining resources because we are telling them that we are using those controllers in those routes because we need to define a map particular url to around so for that one we need to do we need to define resources and we need to find users and resources and we need to define sessions okay so this is how we do it and let's define get get method with sign up which says to users ash new and let's define this as as sign up so and for this we need to define get login okay this is not needed now right now so we can ignore this and let's this is not needed we can ignore this and let's move to this and we need to find the def new and let's end this method okay and we should also uh when we create more value the most probably we are going to create depth create and this and def destroy destroy and end and when we move to this views users and we create a file okay something wrong yeah new file and we need to define new.html.erb and let's define a page sign up so i hope this is fine and yeah so sign up is the page so let's see the flow first so we have a route short rb we say get sign up users new and as sign up and in here we define a signup method new and this has a like default statement of this render new okay so if you want to like have a good overview so this is a default statement it must be rendering so we can skip this as a practice we can skip this and it will definitely render the new.html.erb okay so let's run this and i hope the server is not running so let's exit this rails server and let's define sign up so we have like so it says rendered user.new. with layouts and let's see yeah the signup is there so this is the basic layout so in the same way a very quick we can do this we can also create a few things here also def new we can also create that new end dev create and we can end this method and def destroy so so this is the basic architecture so we are maintaining user model user controller and a session controller for our application so basically these things are needed so this will help you out to like maintain the application so then in the same way we can create few more routes as well so one is like sign up and another is sign in and one is also like login logout so we can maintain those routes and help us so next what we are going to do we are going to create a form here so basically those form is also obviously it is going to have like few things a registration form basically so we are going to register the user here so it will have a method a basically method which is going to be post okay so this is going to be post method and uh and we'll define the action here action is a way like it is being empty here so action is there and we need to define something for that okay so i'll catch in the next tutorial thank you for everyone for watching this thank you bye
