00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - Subs with your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:08 - application and in this video I will
00:11 - show you how to use functions with your
00:14 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:18 - first thing is what is the difference
00:21 - between subs and the
00:23 - functions uh procedurally or basically
00:27 - they both execute the same same kind of
00:31 - uh uh code but the basic difference
00:34 - between subs and function is the subs
00:38 - does not return any value and the
00:41 - function Returns the values now let me
00:45 - demonstrate what I mean by returning the
00:48 - value so I have this basic form and I
00:51 - have taken two text boxes textbox one
00:54 - and text box text box two and I have
00:57 - this button from the last video which
00:59 - have the text text execute sub but I'm
01:01 - going to change this text in this video
01:04 - and I'm going to the text property and I
01:07 - say
01:10 - execute function this time okay now I'm
01:16 - going to double click this button and in
01:19 - the last video we have seen how to
01:22 - execute a sub with the help of this
01:25 - button click event and this was the
01:27 - procedure which we have created which
01:30 - was the sub procedure in this video also
01:33 - we will create a add procedure but with
01:37 - the function procedure so let's create a
01:41 - function just go below
01:44 - your button click sub or you can make
01:48 - function
01:50 - above here also so in between your class
01:55 - starting and Class end you can make the
01:58 - function anywhere you want
02:00 - okay so let me start by creating a
02:04 - function so I will say
02:07 - private and then I will use the
02:11 - notation
02:13 - function and I will uh give the name of
02:16 - the function which is
02:19 - ADD function this time and I will just
02:24 - give the bracket and press enter and you
02:27 - see here it will automatic creates this
02:31 - end function code for you
02:35 - now it also takes so I have told you
02:39 - that the basic difference between sub
02:42 - and the function is that it returns a
02:45 - value so we can uh Define what value we
02:50 - are expecting from the function by just
02:53 - going after this uh parenthesis and
02:57 - write
02:58 - as and what value we are expecting for
03:01 - example we we are expecting
03:06 - integer okay so we can Define here what
03:12 - return value we are expecting from the
03:15 - sub okay and we can pass the parameter
03:18 - to
03:19 - these uh functions as we can pass the
03:24 - parameters as we have seen last time
03:26 - that we can pass the parameter in these
03:29 - brackets
03:30 - in the subs so I'll just copy it and
03:33 - paste those two values which is by value
03:37 - a which is a name of Y value as integer
03:40 - and by Val b as integer okay and we
03:47 - will just copy the last code which what
03:51 - was it was doing is it was taking a and
03:55 - b and adding those two integers and put
03:59 - it in put it put it into this sum
04:04 - integer okay but now the difference here
04:08 - occurs between function and sub that we
04:11 - return so we write return and we will
04:14 - say sum which is the integer right so we
04:20 - already defined here that we are going
04:23 - to
04:24 - return integer here so we are going to
04:28 - return sum which is an integer
04:30 - right and now I will delete this sub
04:35 - which was already there in the button
04:37 - click event once again we I come to the
04:41 - button click event and this time I'm
04:43 - going to call a function called add
04:47 - function but first of all let me create
04:51 - the variable called
04:57 - them result
05:02 - as integer okay and why I have created
05:07 - this
05:09 - because I will store my value which is
05:13 - returned by this function in this
05:15 - variable so I will write result is equal
05:20 - to
05:22 - and I will call this add function from
05:25 - here so I will write add function which
05:30 - appears here
05:32 - automatically and I will pass my
05:36 - values here so uh I will pass the values
05:40 - from the text boxes which I have right
05:43 - so I have text box one and text box two
05:46 - you can see the name from here the name
05:48 - of the text boxes and I will write
05:51 - here text box
05:55 - one
05:57 - dot text
06:01 - comma textbox
06:04 - 2 dot text okay so what I'm doing is
06:10 - what I whatever I will enter in these
06:12 - text boxes what it will do is it will
06:16 - add those two values so I'm passing
06:20 - these two values from here to the
06:23 - function it will add two values
06:26 - and place it in this sum variable and it
06:30 - will return this sum as a function and
06:33 - this return value we are catching in in
06:38 - this integer variable
06:41 - right okay now I want to show the
06:46 - message which contains the result so I
06:48 - will
06:49 - write message
06:52 - box dot
06:54 - show and I will
06:57 - say double quotes
07:04 - the
07:07 - result is and I'll give this ENT sign
07:12 - and I will pass my return variable okay
07:18 - and so this is how this function will
07:22 - execute from here and pass the result in
07:25 - this variable and which this value AI
07:29 - aable in the message box it will give
07:31 - the result once again I will run the
07:33 - program and I will give some integer
07:36 - values here and here and when I run the
07:39 - program it'll give me the addition of
07:42 - those two values right but this time
07:45 - it's by using
07:48 - functions so just remember that the
07:51 - basic difference between subs and
07:53 - function is the function Returns the
07:56 - values and Subs just execute
08:00 - the piece of code and it doesn't return
08:02 - any value okay so I hope you have
08:05 - understood the difference between the
08:06 - two and you have understood the basic
08:09 - concept of functions so please keep
08:11 - watching these videos and please create
08:14 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use Subs with your Visual Basic Windows Form application and in this video I will show you how to use functions with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so first thing is what is the difference between subs and the functions uh procedurally or basically they both execute the same same kind of uh uh code but the basic difference between subs and function is the subs does not return any value and the function Returns the values now let me demonstrate what I mean by returning the value so I have this basic form and I have taken two text boxes textbox one and text box text box two and I have this button from the last video which have the text text execute sub but I'm going to change this text in this video and I'm going to the text property and I say execute function this time okay now I'm going to double click this button and in the last video we have seen how to execute a sub with the help of this button click event and this was the procedure which we have created which was the sub procedure in this video also we will create a add procedure but with the function procedure so let's create a function just go below your button click sub or you can make function above here also so in between your class starting and Class end you can make the function anywhere you want okay so let me start by creating a function so I will say private and then I will use the notation function and I will uh give the name of the function which is ADD function this time and I will just give the bracket and press enter and you see here it will automatic creates this end function code for you now it also takes so I have told you that the basic difference between sub and the function is that it returns a value so we can uh Define what value we are expecting from the function by just going after this uh parenthesis and write as and what value we are expecting for example we we are expecting integer okay so we can Define here what return value we are expecting from the sub okay and we can pass the parameter to these uh functions as we can pass the parameters as we have seen last time that we can pass the parameter in these brackets in the subs so I'll just copy it and paste those two values which is by value a which is a name of Y value as integer and by Val b as integer okay and we will just copy the last code which what was it was doing is it was taking a and b and adding those two integers and put it in put it put it into this sum integer okay but now the difference here occurs between function and sub that we return so we write return and we will say sum which is the integer right so we already defined here that we are going to return integer here so we are going to return sum which is an integer right and now I will delete this sub which was already there in the button click event once again we I come to the button click event and this time I'm going to call a function called add function but first of all let me create the variable called them result as integer okay and why I have created this because I will store my value which is returned by this function in this variable so I will write result is equal to and I will call this add function from here so I will write add function which appears here automatically and I will pass my values here so uh I will pass the values from the text boxes which I have right so I have text box one and text box two you can see the name from here the name of the text boxes and I will write here text box one dot text comma textbox 2 dot text okay so what I'm doing is what I whatever I will enter in these text boxes what it will do is it will add those two values so I'm passing these two values from here to the function it will add two values and place it in this sum variable and it will return this sum as a function and this return value we are catching in in this integer variable right okay now I want to show the message which contains the result so I will write message box dot show and I will say double quotes the result is and I'll give this ENT sign and I will pass my return variable okay and so this is how this function will execute from here and pass the result in this variable and which this value AI aable in the message box it will give the result once again I will run the program and I will give some integer values here and here and when I run the program it'll give me the addition of those two values right but this time it's by using functions so just remember that the basic difference between subs and function is the function Returns the values and Subs just execute the piece of code and it doesn't return any value okay so I hope you have understood the difference between the two and you have understood the basic concept of functions so please keep watching these videos and please create comment and subscribe and bye for now
