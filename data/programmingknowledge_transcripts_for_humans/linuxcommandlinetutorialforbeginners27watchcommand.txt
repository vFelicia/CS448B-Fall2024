00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - letting some online tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video I'm going to
00:05 - show you how you can use watch command
00:07 - in Linux what is an excellent command
00:10 - which can run scripts for command at a
00:13 - regular interval or repeatedly so for
00:18 - example I'm going to give you an example
00:20 - which I have taken in the last video and
00:22 - you have used this free command to know
00:25 - the resources used in our system right
00:28 - and if you use a watch command so any
00:32 - command which you use with watch so I'm
00:34 - going to just try it watch before this
00:37 - command then this command will be
00:40 - executed repeatedly if you use watch
00:43 - before any command right so let's just
00:49 - press ENTER and you can see after every
00:53 - two seconds this command is going to be
00:56 - executed and you can see the resources
00:59 - used will be changed after two second
01:02 - you can see it's changed right so by
01:05 - default the command will be executed at
01:08 - an interval of two seconds right now if
01:12 - you want to make it faster we can do it
01:15 - just press control C to come out of this
01:19 - command so just press control control C
01:22 - and you will come out of this Kamal now
01:25 - for example we want to increase the
01:27 - frequency to execute this command you
01:30 - can use the flag n and then the number
01:35 - of seconds which you want to provide so
01:38 - earlier by default it was 2 for example
01:41 - I want to use 1 second interval so I can
01:43 - just write minus M space 1 and it's
01:46 - going to be executed at an interval of 1
01:49 - second so I am going to press ENTER once
01:51 - again and now it's you know refreshing
01:55 - at a 1 second interval ok now even I can
02:02 - you know increase this frequency in
02:05 - points also so what we can do is I'm
02:07 - going to open press control C once again
02:10 - and instead of one second for example I
02:13 - want
02:13 - who execute this command at an interval
02:16 - of 0.5 second I can just do it by just
02:20 - writing 0.5 here and press Enter and
02:23 - it's going to be executed at 0.5 second
02:26 - you can see every 0.5 second ok so this
02:31 - is how you can use watch command so you
02:33 - can use this watch command with any
02:36 - command or even with the script is going
02:38 - to execute that script repeatedly ok so
02:43 - in the last video we have also seen that
02:46 - DF command which is disk free command
02:48 - right so we can also use this this free
02:52 - command you can just write TF and then
02:55 - press enter and it's going to you know
02:58 - execute this command repeatedly right
03:01 - now nothing is happening here because we
03:04 - are not downloading or uploading
03:05 - anything on our system or from our
03:09 - system for example if you download a big
03:12 - file you will be able to see the used
03:14 - memory and available memory changing so
03:17 - you can use it as a you know watch to
03:22 - watch what kind of memory is used or you
03:26 - can you know think of any command which
03:29 - can be used repeatedly and you can use
03:32 - this command with that command
03:36 - ok so I hope you've enjoyed this video
03:38 - please rate comment and subscribe and
03:40 - bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on letting some online tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can use watch command in Linux what is an excellent command which can run scripts for command at a regular interval or repeatedly so for example I'm going to give you an example which I have taken in the last video and you have used this free command to know the resources used in our system right and if you use a watch command so any command which you use with watch so I'm going to just try it watch before this command then this command will be executed repeatedly if you use watch before any command right so let's just press ENTER and you can see after every two seconds this command is going to be executed and you can see the resources used will be changed after two second you can see it's changed right so by default the command will be executed at an interval of two seconds right now if you want to make it faster we can do it just press control C to come out of this command so just press control control C and you will come out of this Kamal now for example we want to increase the frequency to execute this command you can use the flag n and then the number of seconds which you want to provide so earlier by default it was 2 for example I want to use 1 second interval so I can just write minus M space 1 and it's going to be executed at an interval of 1 second so I am going to press ENTER once again and now it's you know refreshing at a 1 second interval ok now even I can you know increase this frequency in points also so what we can do is I'm going to open press control C once again and instead of one second for example I want who execute this command at an interval of 0.5 second I can just do it by just writing 0.5 here and press Enter and it's going to be executed at 0.5 second you can see every 0.5 second ok so this is how you can use watch command so you can use this watch command with any command or even with the script is going to execute that script repeatedly ok so in the last video we have also seen that DF command which is disk free command right so we can also use this this free command you can just write TF and then press enter and it's going to you know execute this command repeatedly right now nothing is happening here because we are not downloading or uploading anything on our system or from our system for example if you download a big file you will be able to see the used memory and available memory changing so you can use it as a you know watch to watch what kind of memory is used or you can you know think of any command which can be used repeatedly and you can use this command with that command ok so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
