00:00 - now in this video we'll be creating one
00:02 - of the script that is the uh cloning
00:04 - repository okay so basically this is
00:07 - crypto will what way it will do it will
00:08 - basically clone the whatever the
00:10 - depository if you want to clone from the
00:11 - GitHub so basically we will be doing in
00:13 - this particular script so let me just
00:15 - create the file that is the 24
00:16 - underscore
00:19 - uh clone repo dot sh okay now we are
00:23 - good to go we have to just uh
00:26 - so this is the basically a very simple
00:28 - script which we'll be uh doing right now
00:30 - okay so the way let me just tell you the
00:34 - use case how the thing will go like
00:36 - basically we will read the uh like link
00:39 - from the user okay we will use the git
00:42 - command
00:43 - okay and it will basically uh
00:45 - automatically uh create one of the
00:47 - folder inside our repos inside our
00:49 - system okay so this way basically a
00:51 - simple use case which we'll be doing
00:52 - inside this particular video so how we
00:54 - can do it we will use the concept of the
00:56 - local variable uh not local uh low
00:59 - globally Global variable and we will use
01:01 - the functions also
01:03 - okay so how we can do it uh if you want
01:06 - to do it on your own then that is a very
01:08 - good thing so now let me just uh Echo
01:13 - enter the repository link
01:16 - depository link okay so we will ask the
01:19 - user to enter the repository link so we
01:21 - will just read this thing inside the
01:24 - repo link variable okay and I will
01:27 - create the function get repo
01:29 - uh not like this get repo okay and two
01:34 - parentheses Eco and here I'll just Echo
01:39 - getting Repository
01:43 - please wait
01:44 - like this
01:46 - and we can use the command get clone
01:51 - okay and get clone and the reporting
01:54 - will provide
01:56 - okay
01:59 - so now what I will do uh
02:02 - we have to just call this script call
02:04 - the function sorry get report
02:07 - and provide a certain permission to the
02:09 - script CH mode Plus x24
02:12 - clear the screen dot slash 24 okay Enter
02:14 - the deposit to link so let me tell you
02:16 - we will be like
02:18 - uh what we can see cloning this link
02:22 - okay or this repository cell scripting
02:25 - tutorial
02:26 - so let me just go back here and Ctrl
02:30 - shift to B now enter so here you can see
02:33 - cloning depositivity is wait
02:36 - so it is done so now here we can see all
02:40 - those file have been
02:42 - like uh cloned here okay one to ten
02:44 - because we have added only uh till 10.
02:47 - so let me just again uh delete this
02:50 - link okay delete this directory clear
02:54 - the screen
02:55 - okay so uh this is the very simple
02:58 - script which we show right now so now
03:01 - what we can do we can check uh
03:03 - whether the user has entered link or not
03:07 - okay
03:08 - so this thing we can do in our next
03:10 - video okay like we will check about the
03:13 - uh like regular expression and all those
03:15 - things okay in our next video so that's
03:17 - all for today's guide and I hope you in
03:18 - the uh
03:20 - in the next video I'll meet you so thank
03:22 - you for watching
