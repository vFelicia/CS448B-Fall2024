00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - python on your windows 11 operating
00:06 - system
00:07 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:09 - we can do it
00:10 - so first of all we are going to check
00:11 - whether your windows 11 operating system
00:13 - already have a previous version of
00:15 - python or not for this you can just open
00:19 - your
00:20 - search bar and search for cmd or command
00:23 - prompt and then open the command prompt
00:26 - and then you just need to type python
00:28 - here okay when you type python and when
00:31 - you press enter
00:33 - and if it opens uh this microsoft store
00:37 - so you can see on microsoft store
00:40 - the latest version which is available is
00:43 - python 3.9 but we are not going to
00:45 - install python using this microsoft
00:48 - store so when you type python and it
00:50 - doesn't show any
00:52 - repel or terminal
00:54 - for a python then python is most
00:57 - probably not installed on your
00:59 - windows operating system so let's see
01:01 - how we can install python so close your
01:03 - command prompt and then open your
01:05 - favorite browser and search for python
01:07 - download
01:08 - and the first link which will appear
01:10 - here will be from python.org forward
01:12 - slash download so i'm going to click on
01:14 - this link and then straight away on the
01:17 - main download page you will see this
01:20 - download python 3.10 at the time of
01:22 - making this video python 3.10 is the
01:25 - latest version of python
01:27 - available you can also see the previous
01:30 - versions of python here so as we have
01:33 - seen microsoft store was showing us
01:36 - the version 3.9 but the latest version
01:38 - at the time of making this video is 3.10
01:41 - right so i always trust and recommend to
01:44 - download the python from the official
01:46 - website right
01:48 - so once you are on the download page
01:50 - click on this download python
01:52 - button here we're just going to download
01:54 - the python 3.10 exe file you can see
01:58 - this file is downloaded so i'm going to
02:00 - click on this exe file and then i'm
02:02 - going to minimize my browser so now on
02:04 - this first window there are few
02:07 - important things to note
02:09 - so the first thing here is python will
02:12 - be installed at this path on your
02:15 - windows 11 operating system right
02:18 - now what i prefer generally is to
02:21 - install python directly in my c
02:25 - directory and not on this long path
02:29 - so instead of clicking on this install
02:31 - now button i always click on customize
02:35 - installation button but first of all you
02:38 - need to also check this checkbox which
02:41 - says add python whatever version of
02:44 - python you are installing to path
02:46 - what this is going to do is it's going
02:48 - to add the python binary path in your
02:51 - environmental variable on your windows
02:54 - 11 operating system which is going to
02:56 - help you to run python from the command
02:59 - prompt right i'm also going to show you
03:02 - how you can manually set this but just
03:04 - check this check box and then click on
03:07 - customize installation
03:09 - and here just leave everything as
03:12 - default
03:13 - and then click on next and on the next
03:15 - window you can see the advanced options
03:18 - right so if you want to install python
03:20 - for all the users you can check this
03:22 - checkbox
03:23 - and
03:24 - if you want to download the debugging
03:27 - symbols and debug binaries
03:29 - you can also check these check boxes so
03:33 - it's going to also download all the
03:35 - debugging symbols and binaries so it
03:38 - will make your debugging easier right
03:42 - now in the customize installation you
03:45 - can see this location is provided i
03:48 - generally as i said prefer to download
03:52 - python on my c drive directly so i
03:55 - generally create this folder which is
03:58 - called python and then whatever the
04:00 - version i'm installing so i'm installing
04:02 - version 3.10
04:04 - so i generally name the folder python310
04:08 - right if i'm installing the version
04:10 - python 3.9 then i will name this folder
04:13 - python39
04:15 - okay
04:16 - and then i'm going to click on install
04:18 - which is going to install python
04:21 - and in between you will see this warning
04:23 - which says do you want to allow this app
04:25 - to make changes on your device i trust
04:27 - this app so i will click on yes here
04:30 - and then it's going to start the
04:32 - installation process of python on my
04:35 - windows 11 operating system
04:37 - so just wait for this process to
04:39 - complete so now in the end i will see
04:42 - this window which says setup was
04:44 - successful you also have this option
04:47 - disable path length limit which you can
04:50 - do later also i'm not going to click on
04:52 - this option and then i'm going to click
04:54 - on the close button button
04:57 - and once you do that python is
04:59 - successfully installed on your windows
05:01 - 11 operating system
05:03 - now you can check whether all the tools
05:06 - are available for python by clicking on
05:08 - the windows start menu and then you can
05:11 - see the recommended section here so when
05:14 - you click on more under recommended you
05:16 - will see the recently installed tools
05:18 - and you can see python comes with this
05:21 - idle ide which will help you to write
05:24 - python code
05:25 - it also comes with this python terminal
05:28 - which is going to help you to run python
05:29 - commands on your python terminal
05:33 - you can also run the python on the
05:36 - native command prompt or powershell
05:38 - whatever you have right
05:40 - so now let's check first on command
05:43 - prompt if python command is working or
05:45 - not
05:46 - so i'm going to just search for cmd once
05:48 - again and then open the command prompt
05:51 - and once command prompt is open i'm
05:53 - going to just type python space hyphen
05:57 - hyphen
05:58 - version okay
06:00 - and then press enter which is going to
06:02 - show you the version of python you have
06:05 - on your windows 11 operating system so
06:07 - we have installed python 3.10
06:10 - so that's why it's showing us the
06:11 - version of python
06:13 - python also comes with python
06:16 - package manager which is called pip you
06:18 - can also check the version of pip here
06:20 - so i'm going to just write pip
06:23 - version and then press enter and it's
06:26 - going to show me the version of pip
06:28 - which is installed for
06:30 - uh python right so you can see pip
06:34 - 21.2.3 is installed for python 3.10 on
06:38 - my windows 11 operating system
06:41 - also when i type python here and then
06:44 - press enter here it's going to open the
06:46 - python repel repel stands for read eval
06:50 - print loop which in simple terms is
06:53 - going to help you to just type your
06:55 - command and then get the result at the
06:58 - same terminal so let's say i just type 5
07:01 - plus 5 and then press enter it's going
07:03 - to just add these two uh numbers and
07:06 - give me the sum of these two numbers
07:08 - i can also write
07:11 - print here and then in the brackets i
07:14 - can just type
07:15 - hello space
07:17 - world here and then close the bracket
07:20 - and then press enter it's going to print
07:23 - hello world so print is nothing but an
07:26 - inbuilt function in python which is
07:28 - going to help us to print
07:30 - strings and other values right
07:33 - so everything is working fine
07:35 - now in case you don't see uh this python
07:39 - version when you type python version
07:42 - command here
07:43 - then
07:44 - your environmental variable for python
07:47 - is not set
07:49 - so
07:50 - in that case what you can do in that
07:51 - case just go to the location where you
07:53 - have installed python in my case i have
07:55 - installed python in my c drive and if
07:58 - you remember i have installed python in
08:00 - this directory which is called python
08:01 - 310
08:03 - go inside that directory so this is the
08:05 - folder where all your python related
08:07 - files are available right so for now i'm
08:11 - going to minimize this window
08:13 - and what you need to do is you need to
08:15 - set the python environment variable on
08:17 - your windows 11 operating system so what
08:19 - you can do here is you can just write
08:22 - edit
08:24 - e and v and it's going to show you this
08:27 - result which says edit environment
08:29 - variable for your account i'm going to
08:32 - click on this option which is going to
08:34 - open this window if you don't see edit
08:36 - environment variable for your account
08:38 - result then you can open
08:41 - control panel also so this is the long
08:44 - way of
08:45 - reaching to the same point
08:47 - so just open control panel then view by
08:50 - category then click on system and
08:52 - security then click on system and then
08:55 - once system window opens under system
08:58 - you will be able to see advanced system
09:00 - settings so just click on advanced
09:03 - system settings
09:04 - and once this window opens
09:06 - you need to click on the environment
09:09 - variables so once you click on this it's
09:12 - going to open the same window
09:14 - right so you can see the same window is
09:17 - opened okay so you can directly search
09:20 - for environment variables
09:22 - window or you can just navigate it using
09:26 - control panel
09:28 - now here
09:29 - when you click on the path here so just
09:32 - click on path environment variable and
09:35 - then click on edit
09:37 - you will see
09:38 - that this path is added by python
09:41 - installer on your windows 11 operating
09:44 - system so if this path is not available
09:47 - see a colon
09:49 - python 310 or whatever directory you
09:52 - have for your python installation
09:55 - then you need to add that directory
09:57 - manually okay so if you don't see any uh
10:00 - thing related to python in the
10:02 - environment variables then you just need
10:05 - to copy this path like this
10:08 - and then add it you can add it by just
10:10 - clicking on new or just double clicking
10:13 - on this
10:14 - line here and then just paste your path
10:17 - which is essentially the same path which
10:18 - is added by python for me right but if
10:21 - it's not present you can do that also
10:24 - okay
10:25 - so once you you do that
10:28 - you can just click on ok and then click
10:30 - on ok and then click on ok
10:33 - and close everything and then
10:35 - python command is going to work using
10:38 - the command prompt also on your windows
10:40 - 11 operating system
10:42 - now as i said python also comes with
10:45 - other tools so you can again search for
10:49 - python here so you can again search for
10:52 - python here and you can see it comes
10:55 - with its own terminal this is not the
10:58 - command prompt but the python terminal
11:00 - right so you can click on this python
11:02 - terminal
11:03 - i can just increase the font size by
11:06 - right clicking on the top and then click
11:08 - on properties
11:10 - and then click on fonts and then
11:12 - increase the font size so you can see
11:15 - this font in
11:17 - the larger fonts right here also you can
11:20 - type
11:21 - print and then
11:23 - you can type your command for example
11:25 - hello
11:26 - world and then press enter which is
11:29 - going to show you
11:31 - the result or you can just uh do some
11:34 - arithmetic operations and other
11:36 - operations on this
11:38 - python terminal ripple
11:40 - also python comes with the idle ide you
11:44 - can see idle or you can search for idl e
11:48 - and then click on this idle ide
11:51 - this is
11:52 - the ide which comes
11:54 - by default when you install python on
11:56 - your windows operating system here also
11:59 - you can increase the font size uh by
12:02 - just clicking on the options and then
12:04 - click on configure
12:06 - idle
12:07 - and from here you can increase the font
12:09 - size to
12:11 - a bigger value so let's say i just
12:14 - configure it to 20
12:16 - apply click on ok
12:18 - and then font size is changed right here
12:21 - also i can just do some arithmetic
12:23 - operations you can also create a python
12:26 - file using a file and then click on new
12:29 - file
12:30 - and then
12:32 - you can name your file anything so file
12:35 - save as
12:36 - and then you can save your file
12:38 - somewhere i'm going to save my file in
12:40 - documents for example
12:42 - and then i'm going to
12:44 - just name my file as hello dot py and
12:46 - then press enter which is going to save
12:49 - my hello dot py file
12:52 - on this location and here you can write
12:55 - your commands for example print again
12:59 - i'm going to write and you can see
13:01 - python idle also gives you this
13:03 - intellisense so it's going to help you
13:06 - to write your code right hello world
13:10 - once again i'm going to write and then
13:12 - close this parenthesis
13:14 - and then you can save this file by just
13:17 - clicking on
13:18 - save or control s
13:21 - and then you can run it from here so you
13:23 - can click on
13:25 - run and then click on run module
13:28 - and then it's going to show you the
13:31 - result of this file so this is how you
13:34 - can download and install and use python
13:37 - on your windows 11 operating system i
13:40 - hope you've enjoyed this video and i
13:41 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install python on your windows 11 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all we are going to check whether your windows 11 operating system already have a previous version of python or not for this you can just open your search bar and search for cmd or command prompt and then open the command prompt and then you just need to type python here okay when you type python and when you press enter and if it opens uh this microsoft store so you can see on microsoft store the latest version which is available is python 3.9 but we are not going to install python using this microsoft store so when you type python and it doesn't show any repel or terminal for a python then python is most probably not installed on your windows operating system so let's see how we can install python so close your command prompt and then open your favorite browser and search for python download and the first link which will appear here will be from python.org forward slash download so i'm going to click on this link and then straight away on the main download page you will see this download python 3.10 at the time of making this video python 3.10 is the latest version of python available you can also see the previous versions of python here so as we have seen microsoft store was showing us the version 3.9 but the latest version at the time of making this video is 3.10 right so i always trust and recommend to download the python from the official website right so once you are on the download page click on this download python button here we're just going to download the python 3.10 exe file you can see this file is downloaded so i'm going to click on this exe file and then i'm going to minimize my browser so now on this first window there are few important things to note so the first thing here is python will be installed at this path on your windows 11 operating system right now what i prefer generally is to install python directly in my c directory and not on this long path so instead of clicking on this install now button i always click on customize installation button but first of all you need to also check this checkbox which says add python whatever version of python you are installing to path what this is going to do is it's going to add the python binary path in your environmental variable on your windows 11 operating system which is going to help you to run python from the command prompt right i'm also going to show you how you can manually set this but just check this check box and then click on customize installation and here just leave everything as default and then click on next and on the next window you can see the advanced options right so if you want to install python for all the users you can check this checkbox and if you want to download the debugging symbols and debug binaries you can also check these check boxes so it's going to also download all the debugging symbols and binaries so it will make your debugging easier right now in the customize installation you can see this location is provided i generally as i said prefer to download python on my c drive directly so i generally create this folder which is called python and then whatever the version i'm installing so i'm installing version 3.10 so i generally name the folder python310 right if i'm installing the version python 3.9 then i will name this folder python39 okay and then i'm going to click on install which is going to install python and in between you will see this warning which says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device i trust this app so i will click on yes here and then it's going to start the installation process of python on my windows 11 operating system so just wait for this process to complete so now in the end i will see this window which says setup was successful you also have this option disable path length limit which you can do later also i'm not going to click on this option and then i'm going to click on the close button button and once you do that python is successfully installed on your windows 11 operating system now you can check whether all the tools are available for python by clicking on the windows start menu and then you can see the recommended section here so when you click on more under recommended you will see the recently installed tools and you can see python comes with this idle ide which will help you to write python code it also comes with this python terminal which is going to help you to run python commands on your python terminal you can also run the python on the native command prompt or powershell whatever you have right so now let's check first on command prompt if python command is working or not so i'm going to just search for cmd once again and then open the command prompt and once command prompt is open i'm going to just type python space hyphen hyphen version okay and then press enter which is going to show you the version of python you have on your windows 11 operating system so we have installed python 3.10 so that's why it's showing us the version of python python also comes with python package manager which is called pip you can also check the version of pip here so i'm going to just write pip version and then press enter and it's going to show me the version of pip which is installed for uh python right so you can see pip 21.2.3 is installed for python 3.10 on my windows 11 operating system also when i type python here and then press enter here it's going to open the python repel repel stands for read eval print loop which in simple terms is going to help you to just type your command and then get the result at the same terminal so let's say i just type 5 plus 5 and then press enter it's going to just add these two uh numbers and give me the sum of these two numbers i can also write print here and then in the brackets i can just type hello space world here and then close the bracket and then press enter it's going to print hello world so print is nothing but an inbuilt function in python which is going to help us to print strings and other values right so everything is working fine now in case you don't see uh this python version when you type python version command here then your environmental variable for python is not set so in that case what you can do in that case just go to the location where you have installed python in my case i have installed python in my c drive and if you remember i have installed python in this directory which is called python 310 go inside that directory so this is the folder where all your python related files are available right so for now i'm going to minimize this window and what you need to do is you need to set the python environment variable on your windows 11 operating system so what you can do here is you can just write edit e and v and it's going to show you this result which says edit environment variable for your account i'm going to click on this option which is going to open this window if you don't see edit environment variable for your account result then you can open control panel also so this is the long way of reaching to the same point so just open control panel then view by category then click on system and security then click on system and then once system window opens under system you will be able to see advanced system settings so just click on advanced system settings and once this window opens you need to click on the environment variables so once you click on this it's going to open the same window right so you can see the same window is opened okay so you can directly search for environment variables window or you can just navigate it using control panel now here when you click on the path here so just click on path environment variable and then click on edit you will see that this path is added by python installer on your windows 11 operating system so if this path is not available see a colon python 310 or whatever directory you have for your python installation then you need to add that directory manually okay so if you don't see any uh thing related to python in the environment variables then you just need to copy this path like this and then add it you can add it by just clicking on new or just double clicking on this line here and then just paste your path which is essentially the same path which is added by python for me right but if it's not present you can do that also okay so once you you do that you can just click on ok and then click on ok and then click on ok and close everything and then python command is going to work using the command prompt also on your windows 11 operating system now as i said python also comes with other tools so you can again search for python here so you can again search for python here and you can see it comes with its own terminal this is not the command prompt but the python terminal right so you can click on this python terminal i can just increase the font size by right clicking on the top and then click on properties and then click on fonts and then increase the font size so you can see this font in the larger fonts right here also you can type print and then you can type your command for example hello world and then press enter which is going to show you the result or you can just uh do some arithmetic operations and other operations on this python terminal ripple also python comes with the idle ide you can see idle or you can search for idl e and then click on this idle ide this is the ide which comes by default when you install python on your windows operating system here also you can increase the font size uh by just clicking on the options and then click on configure idle and from here you can increase the font size to a bigger value so let's say i just configure it to 20 apply click on ok and then font size is changed right here also i can just do some arithmetic operations you can also create a python file using a file and then click on new file and then you can name your file anything so file save as and then you can save your file somewhere i'm going to save my file in documents for example and then i'm going to just name my file as hello dot py and then press enter which is going to save my hello dot py file on this location and here you can write your commands for example print again i'm going to write and you can see python idle also gives you this intellisense so it's going to help you to write your code right hello world once again i'm going to write and then close this parenthesis and then you can save this file by just clicking on save or control s and then you can run it from here so you can click on run and then click on run module and then it's going to show you the result of this file so this is how you can download and install and use python on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
