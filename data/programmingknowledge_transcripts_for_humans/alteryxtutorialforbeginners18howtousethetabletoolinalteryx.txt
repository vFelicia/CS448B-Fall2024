00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to the
00:02 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
00:04 - going to talk about
00:06 - a new tab
00:08 - that is the reporting tab in our tricks
00:11 - so uh this tab might not be by default
00:14 - present in your ultrix designer view so
00:16 - what we're going to do is actually
00:19 - see that how can we add the few tabs
00:21 - that are supported by alteryx okay
00:23 - so uh what we are going to do first of
00:25 - all let's just go to this option this
00:28 - plus icon
00:29 - which would automatically give you an
00:31 - option to add or remove the tools so
00:33 - let's just click on that this would open
00:35 - up the configure tool palette that means
00:37 - all the tools that are actually
00:39 - supported by aldrix but are not being
00:41 - shown on your screen right now
00:43 - so here if you just go uh and check
00:45 - there are many of the tools that are
00:47 - actually supported by ultrex okay
00:50 - so from here what i'm gonna do is i'm
00:52 - just going to support this
00:54 - check on this reporting tab
00:57 - so this would give me a bunch of other
00:59 - tools that i'm gonna use
01:02 - uh like email image insight interactive
01:04 - chart layout
01:06 - map legend overlay render report
01:09 - and table okay so let's just click on ok
01:12 - once we do that this is the reporting
01:14 - tab that would be present in front of us
01:16 - and these are the tools supported by the
01:18 - reporting tab
01:20 - in this video we are going to take a
01:21 - look at the table tool and the
01:23 - interactive chart tool which are of very
01:26 - important
01:27 - in this whole workflow building thing
01:30 - okay
01:31 - so first of all let's just bring up the
01:33 - table tool
01:36 - now uh i have already used the input
01:38 - data tool to get my data set
01:40 - let us just understand the usage of the
01:43 - table tool as the name suggests table
01:45 - tool is used to create a data table or a
01:48 - pivot table to output the report through
01:51 - the render tool okay so as you can see
01:54 - this is the render tool if you want to
01:56 - output the report the render tool is
01:58 - what we are going to use
02:00 - so uh if we just talk about this tool we
02:02 - first have the table mode which means
02:04 - you can select the basic table or the
02:05 - pivot table
02:06 - pivot table is
02:09 - basically used when we are using the
02:11 - data from the crosstab tool
02:13 - in case you have not seen the video the
02:14 - crosstab tool i would recommend you to
02:16 - first go and watch it and then you would
02:19 - be able to understand it easier
02:21 - uh that what i'm trying to say okay so
02:23 - i'm just going to go with the basic
02:24 - table
02:26 - next option we have is the group by
02:28 - option that means the fields through
02:30 - which you want to group by these um
02:32 - values if there is anything so what i'm
02:35 - gonna do is i'm just gonna group by
02:36 - category
02:38 - and sub category okay
02:40 - next we have is the value of a table bit
02:44 - which is basically
02:46 - how you want to
02:48 - adjust your table so automatic that
02:50 - means the minimum width percentage you
02:52 - want a particular percentage fixed you
02:54 - want a particular fixed value okay so
02:56 - i'm just gonna go with automatic
02:58 - right next we have is the
03:03 - column headings if you want to show the
03:05 - column headings or not
03:08 - uh then we have the option of a bar
03:10 - graph
03:11 - so if you want to create a bar graph
03:15 - just a second let me just adjust it a
03:16 - little bit
03:20 - yeah
03:21 - so if you want uh to create a bar graph
03:23 - that means you can specify the data
03:25 - field for which the bar graph needs to
03:27 - be created in the table
03:30 - and this paragraph option is only
03:32 - available for the basic table in case
03:34 - you have selected the pivot table over
03:35 - here then this option would not be
03:37 - available
03:38 - now you can just click on the settings
03:40 - to modify the style of the graph
03:43 - like its weight scale its base value
03:45 - label bars colors etc but i'm not just
03:48 - going to go into very much deep into
03:50 - this bar graph option right now right
03:52 - now we are just going to focus on the
03:53 - table tool okay
03:56 - next is show column headings which is of
03:58 - course let me just uncheck this bar
04:00 - graph so that would be
04:02 - available to us if you want to show the
04:04 - column headings
04:05 - then we have the per column of the
04:06 - methodology configuration option
04:09 - if the table mode is basic then we can
04:12 - configure the columns and if the table
04:15 - mode is the pivot
04:16 - mode then we need to configure the
04:18 - methodologies so in case we have
04:20 - selected basic mode so we are getting
04:23 - the option as per column configuration
04:25 - now we can use
04:27 - it to select the data fields that we
04:29 - want to include in the table
04:31 - using these up and down arrows that are
04:33 - present over here we can just set their
04:36 - order
04:37 - uh we can just rename these fields as
04:39 - well so what i'm gonna do is i'm just
04:40 - gonna uncheck some of these fields
04:44 - okay and i'm just going to go with the
04:50 - only few fields over here okay
04:53 - uh category subcategory product name
05:00 - like this okay
05:02 - i am just uh interested in these fields
05:05 - only okay
05:07 - now if you want uh to configure the
05:09 - attributes of a particular field you can
05:11 - just select that particular field and
05:12 - these attributes would be available for
05:14 - you if you want to get a new name for
05:16 - the field so
05:18 - insert the consumer name i'm just going
05:20 - to go with the name
05:22 - if you want to select its width its
05:24 - alignment its borders prefix suffix
05:27 - anything you want to select you can just
05:29 - select
05:31 - uh this dec places for the number of the
05:33 - decimal places so if you just select
05:35 - some numerical value lets say the sales
05:37 - value so this field would be um
05:40 - enabled okay
05:41 - and like in the prefix i want a dollar
05:44 - symbol to show me that this was the
05:47 - dollar amount and in the end i want to
05:51 - i don't want any suffix just for the
05:52 - prefix i want the dollar okay
05:55 - for the sales
05:56 - and
05:57 - that's it if you want to create some of
05:59 - the column rules you can just create the
06:00 - column rules which basically uh says
06:03 - that what you want to do if you want to
06:05 - apply some kind of a formatting
06:08 - for it so
06:09 - the sales rule one is
06:11 - you apply to the data when
06:14 - the
06:15 - sales is
06:17 - greater than equal to a thousand dollars
06:22 - you can just say
06:25 - the
06:25 - background color
06:27 - must be kind of like green
06:30 - so if the sales value is greater than a
06:32 - thousand dollar i want a green uh
06:34 - background color okay
06:36 - so this is the rule that i have applied
06:40 - okay
06:41 - now
06:42 - next two options we have is the default
06:44 - table settings that means the
06:46 - style options that we want our table to
06:49 - contain would be changed over here
06:51 - or if you want to create a rule for
06:54 - to be applied to all the columns of the
06:56 - data that you can apply using this
06:58 - create row rule option
07:01 - so these are the options that you can
07:03 - control or configure in this table tool
07:07 - now once you are happy with the changes
07:09 - that you have made you can click on run
07:13 - and
07:14 - yes
07:15 - so here is how the output is looking
07:19 - we have categorized them or we have
07:21 - grouped them on the basis of category
07:23 - and subcategory
07:25 - uh and this is the table
07:28 - this is the table that we have got over
07:30 - here
07:30 - just a second
07:36 - okay
07:37 - now
07:38 - uh
07:40 - if you want
07:41 - to get
07:43 - to show this table how would you be able
07:46 - to show it
07:47 - so for that what we need to do is
07:51 - to view the individual records and see
07:54 - whether the changes that you have made
07:56 - in the table are been actually made or
07:58 - not we can simply use a browse tool that
08:01 - is present in the in-out tab okay
08:03 - so once we have used the browse tool and
08:05 - run the workflow this is the kind of the
08:06 - output that we would be getting as you
08:08 - can see the number of the fields have
08:10 - been reduced drastically
08:13 - we are now only getting the fields uh
08:15 - which we actually
08:17 - uh
08:18 - modified right and if you just want to
08:21 - scroll up and down to get a better view
08:23 - that also you can get
08:26 - here you can see in the sales the prefix
08:28 - is added that is a dollar symbol
08:30 - and whenever the sales quantity is more
08:33 - than a thousand dollars we are getting
08:34 - the color the background color as green
08:37 - this was the rule that we created for
08:39 - this values right so you can see all
08:41 - these values are colored in green now so
08:44 - this is how the whole field or the whole
08:46 - table tool is looking
08:49 - now uh let us talk about how can you
08:51 - actually render this table okay
08:55 - now here what we have done is created a
08:57 - copy of these uh two things the basic
09:00 - table and the data
09:03 - in order to render it we go to the
09:04 - reporting tab and grab the render tool
09:06 - the render tool is actually used to
09:09 - render or transform the report snippets
09:11 - into the presentation quality reports
09:14 - into a variety of formats now the
09:16 - formats supported by it are these html
09:18 - compressor pdf rdf word excel png image
09:22 - or a specific output file so from this
09:24 - you need to select the specific output
09:26 - file option in the output file you can
09:28 - just click on this save file
09:31 - and select the format in which you want
09:33 - to save the file i am going with the
09:34 - excel and here you need to type a name
09:36 - so let me just grab the name that is
09:40 - report
09:41 - table
09:42 - over here and click on save now once you
09:45 - do that uh the
09:48 - path would be taken
09:50 - you can just select these different
09:53 - options like if you want a header you
09:54 - want a footer
09:56 - for the table or not
09:58 - that you can just select okay the page
10:00 - of this
10:02 - paper size the orientation for the
10:03 - report as well
10:05 - then click on run
10:07 - once you do that
10:08 - uh
10:09 - the rendering
10:11 - needs to be completed
10:13 - so let's see when it's completed
10:15 - you can just go to this location where
10:17 - you have saved the file and
10:20 - you would see that the changes have been
10:22 - made so here is the report table
10:24 - that we just created the excel sheet and
10:27 - this is how it is looking
10:28 - uh it has been rendered as it is we
10:31 - required like all the changes all the
10:33 - rules have been applied so that's all
10:35 - for the render tool and that's all for
10:37 - this video as well thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a new tab that is the reporting tab in our tricks so uh this tab might not be by default present in your ultrix designer view so what we're going to do is actually see that how can we add the few tabs that are supported by alteryx okay so uh what we are going to do first of all let's just go to this option this plus icon which would automatically give you an option to add or remove the tools so let's just click on that this would open up the configure tool palette that means all the tools that are actually supported by aldrix but are not being shown on your screen right now so here if you just go uh and check there are many of the tools that are actually supported by ultrex okay so from here what i'm gonna do is i'm just going to support this check on this reporting tab so this would give me a bunch of other tools that i'm gonna use uh like email image insight interactive chart layout map legend overlay render report and table okay so let's just click on ok once we do that this is the reporting tab that would be present in front of us and these are the tools supported by the reporting tab in this video we are going to take a look at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are of very important in this whole workflow building thing okay so first of all let's just bring up the table tool now uh i have already used the input data tool to get my data set let us just understand the usage of the table tool as the name suggests table tool is used to create a data table or a pivot table to output the report through the render tool okay so as you can see this is the render tool if you want to output the report the render tool is what we are going to use so uh if we just talk about this tool we first have the table mode which means you can select the basic table or the pivot table pivot table is basically used when we are using the data from the crosstab tool in case you have not seen the video the crosstab tool i would recommend you to first go and watch it and then you would be able to understand it easier uh that what i'm trying to say okay so i'm just going to go with the basic table next option we have is the group by option that means the fields through which you want to group by these um values if there is anything so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna group by category and sub category okay next we have is the value of a table bit which is basically how you want to adjust your table so automatic that means the minimum width percentage you want a particular percentage fixed you want a particular fixed value okay so i'm just gonna go with automatic right next we have is the column headings if you want to show the column headings or not uh then we have the option of a bar graph so if you want to create a bar graph just a second let me just adjust it a little bit yeah so if you want uh to create a bar graph that means you can specify the data field for which the bar graph needs to be created in the table and this paragraph option is only available for the basic table in case you have selected the pivot table over here then this option would not be available now you can just click on the settings to modify the style of the graph like its weight scale its base value label bars colors etc but i'm not just going to go into very much deep into this bar graph option right now right now we are just going to focus on the table tool okay next is show column headings which is of course let me just uncheck this bar graph so that would be available to us if you want to show the column headings then we have the per column of the methodology configuration option if the table mode is basic then we can configure the columns and if the table mode is the pivot mode then we need to configure the methodologies so in case we have selected basic mode so we are getting the option as per column configuration now we can use it to select the data fields that we want to include in the table using these up and down arrows that are present over here we can just set their order uh we can just rename these fields as well so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna uncheck some of these fields okay and i'm just going to go with the only few fields over here okay uh category subcategory product name like this okay i am just uh interested in these fields only okay now if you want uh to configure the attributes of a particular field you can just select that particular field and these attributes would be available for you if you want to get a new name for the field so insert the consumer name i'm just going to go with the name if you want to select its width its alignment its borders prefix suffix anything you want to select you can just select uh this dec places for the number of the decimal places so if you just select some numerical value lets say the sales value so this field would be um enabled okay and like in the prefix i want a dollar symbol to show me that this was the dollar amount and in the end i want to i don't want any suffix just for the prefix i want the dollar okay for the sales and that's it if you want to create some of the column rules you can just create the column rules which basically uh says that what you want to do if you want to apply some kind of a formatting for it so the sales rule one is you apply to the data when the sales is greater than equal to a thousand dollars you can just say the background color must be kind of like green so if the sales value is greater than a thousand dollar i want a green uh background color okay so this is the rule that i have applied okay now next two options we have is the default table settings that means the style options that we want our table to contain would be changed over here or if you want to create a rule for to be applied to all the columns of the data that you can apply using this create row rule option so these are the options that you can control or configure in this table tool now once you are happy with the changes that you have made you can click on run and yes so here is how the output is looking we have categorized them or we have grouped them on the basis of category and subcategory uh and this is the table this is the table that we have got over here just a second okay now uh if you want to get to show this table how would you be able to show it so for that what we need to do is to view the individual records and see whether the changes that you have made in the table are been actually made or not we can simply use a browse tool that is present in the inout tab okay so once we have used the browse tool and run the workflow this is the kind of the output that we would be getting as you can see the number of the fields have been reduced drastically we are now only getting the fields uh which we actually uh modified right and if you just want to scroll up and down to get a better view that also you can get here you can see in the sales the prefix is added that is a dollar symbol and whenever the sales quantity is more than a thousand dollars we are getting the color the background color as green this was the rule that we created for this values right so you can see all these values are colored in green now so this is how the whole field or the whole table tool is looking now uh let us talk about how can you actually render this table okay now here what we have done is created a copy of these uh two things the basic table and the data in order to render it we go to the reporting tab and grab the render tool the render tool is actually used to render or transform the report snippets into the presentation quality reports into a variety of formats now the formats supported by it are these html compressor pdf rdf word excel png image or a specific output file so from this you need to select the specific output file option in the output file you can just click on this save file and select the format in which you want to save the file i am going with the excel and here you need to type a name so let me just grab the name that is report table over here and click on save now once you do that uh the path would be taken you can just select these different options like if you want a header you want a footer for the table or not that you can just select okay the page of this paper size the orientation for the report as well then click on run once you do that uh the rendering needs to be completed so let's see when it's completed you can just go to this location where you have saved the file and you would see that the changes have been made so here is the report table that we just created the excel sheet and this is how it is looking uh it has been rendered as it is we required like all the changes all the rules have been applied so that's all for the render tool and that's all for this video as well thanks for watching
