00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:05 - install a command-line tool for Windows
00:07 - which is better than the native windows
00:11 - command-line tool which is called
00:13 - commander now if you have you know used
00:17 - command-line tool on Windows ever it
00:20 - looks like this so I am using Windows 8
00:23 - and it looks like this and if you are a
00:26 - developer or if you want to use a
00:30 - command line for your work then using
00:36 - this command line tool is not you know
00:38 - satisfactory I would say for example you
00:41 - are building a node application and you
00:44 - need to run node commands here and this
00:48 - works fine but for a developer they want
00:52 - more than this kind of boring
00:55 - command-line tool now you can say
00:58 - Windows 10 has already been there and
01:01 - their command line tool is little bit
01:05 - better but it's not so much better that
01:09 - we can love it for example so let's see
01:13 - what command line tool I'm going to show
01:17 - you and let's see what's the difference
01:18 - between them so what we are going to do
01:21 - is we are going to download and install
01:24 - a free command line tool which is called
01:26 - CMD ER and we say it command tool okay
01:32 - so just I type CMD ER commander and the
01:37 - first link which will appear here will
01:38 - be commander dotnet right so just click
01:42 - this link and this tool is free command
01:46 - line tool so you can use it for free and
01:48 - in here you can see the first look of it
01:53 - it will look like this and to download
01:57 - it you can just click this download
02:00 - button now there are two you know
02:03 - versions of it one is the download mini
02:06 - version which is 6 megabyte and if you
02:09 - are interested in the whole
02:12 - functionality then you can
02:13 - you know download this 80 megabyte
02:17 - download installable file okay so it's a
02:21 - zip file so it's not an installer it's a
02:24 - zip file so you just need to extract it
02:26 - and you just need to you know run the
02:30 - command line tool from there okay so let
02:34 - me save this zip file and once this zip
02:38 - file will be downloaded it will take
02:41 - around one minute on my PC it can take
02:43 - more or less time depending upon the
02:45 - speed of your computer and once it's
02:48 - downloaded we will see how it works okay
02:51 - so now the download of this zip file is
02:55 - complete and I have already extracted
02:57 - this zip file this file will look like
03:00 - this so you just need to extract it in
03:03 - the folder of your choice okay after
03:06 - extracting it you will see this
03:08 - executable file which says commander dot
03:12 - exe you just need to double-click it
03:14 - very simple stuff and I'm going to
03:17 - minimize everything and by the mean time
03:19 - it will start okay now here you can see
03:24 - unlock and continue command and visit
03:27 - home page and exit and it says that some
03:33 - of the dll's are missing you don't need
03:35 - to worry about them you can just say
03:38 - ignore and continue for now okay and
03:41 - then just skip this version for now ok
03:45 - and now it will open this command line
03:48 - too and you can see when you you know
03:52 - start this command line tool the
03:54 - difference between these two command
03:56 - line tools right so you know when at the
04:01 - time when you open it it will look like
04:03 - this very sleek and you know you will
04:07 - love it from the first step itself you
04:11 - can you know follow or execute any
04:15 - command which you can run on Windows and
04:19 - even which you can run on your Linux or
04:23 - UNIX command line tool for example
04:26 - l s- l and list all the you know files
04:33 - and the permissions of your files and
04:36 - folders right or a CD or mkdir or many
04:41 - command line commands it can execute and
04:46 - the best thing what I like about this
04:50 - command line tool is for example if you
04:52 - want to open to command line you know
04:56 - command line or command prompts what you
04:59 - need to do is you need to open the
05:02 - command prompt - or you know two
05:05 - terminals for to command line you know
05:08 - commands if you want to run in parallel
05:11 - right for example in case of you
05:14 - need to run the daemon in
05:17 - background and then you need to execute
05:19 - the shell itself right and in that
05:23 - case you need to open two terminals at
05:26 - the same time and it's not I mean very
05:30 - elegant in case of commander what you
05:34 - need to do is you can just right click
05:36 - on this icon at the top and you can just
05:39 - say new console it will give you this
05:42 - option you can say start and we'll start
05:45 - a new terminal you can see side by side
05:48 - right so you can navigate between them
05:52 - like this you just need to press these
05:55 - tabs and you can open multiple terminals
05:59 - like this on commander this is the
06:01 - feature which I like this command-line
06:05 - tool also comes with SSH so if you want
06:10 - to you know control a remote PC or a
06:15 - Linux operating system it will help you
06:18 - so just SSH and whatever is the IP
06:21 - address of your PC then you will be able
06:26 - to you know access this that PC so you
06:28 - can see when I press SSH and it gives me
06:32 - one bunch of the options right and yeah
06:38 - so you can
06:40 - you can just use it and see if it's good
06:44 - for you or you want to stick with the
06:46 - old command-line tool it's on your you
06:50 - know choice but I am you know lately
06:53 - using this command line tool and I am
06:55 - loving it so I wanted to share with you
06:58 - so that's it I hope you enjoyed this
07:00 - video please recommend subscribe and bye
07:03 - for now
