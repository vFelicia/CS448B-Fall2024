00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - docker tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will talk about how does docker
00:08 - works and we will see some commands
00:10 - related to docker and docker images so
00:14 - as I have told you in the earlier videos
00:16 - also you can build your docker images
00:19 - that holds your applications using
00:22 - docker files and then you can create
00:25 - your docker containers from those docker
00:29 - images to run your applications and then
00:33 - you can share your docker images via
00:37 - docker hub or via your private registry
00:41 - now if you want to see this docker flow
00:45 - in the form of a diagram you can see
00:49 - this diagram here so you can create a
00:52 - docker file which we are going to see
00:54 - how we can create a docker file in the
00:57 - later videos so docker file is a file
01:00 - from which you can build your
01:04 - applications into docker images so what
01:09 - happens is you pull some images which
01:12 - are already there on the docker hub and
01:15 - you use those images with your
01:19 - application and you write all that code
01:24 - or that script inside your docker file
01:28 - so how will your application run inside
01:31 - a container you write everything in a
01:35 - docker file and then you build your
01:39 - docker file which will create a docker
01:42 - image and when you run your docker image
01:45 - it will be converted to a docker
01:48 - container now let's see some commands
01:52 - related to docker so the first command
01:55 - which I want to show you is the docker
01:58 - search command so you just write docker
02:01 - search and then you give your options
02:04 - for example whatever image you want to
02:09 - fetch from your docker hub
02:13 - you can just write that image name for
02:17 - example I just write Ubuntu here so you
02:22 - can search all the images which are
02:25 - there related to open to on docker hub
02:29 - using this command so docker search
02:31 - Ubuntu so when you give docker search
02:34 - open to you will see this kind of result
02:37 - in the form of our table and the first
02:41 - column here is the name the second
02:45 - column here is the description third is
02:48 - the number of stars and if the image
02:52 - have more number of stars then it's more
02:55 - popular also you have the column for
02:59 - official so if you see okay under
03:04 - official for a particular image so for
03:08 - example this first image with the name
03:10 - open - is the official image on docker
03:13 - hub and you can also see some
03:16 - description here so clearly this first
03:19 - image which is an official image also is
03:22 - the most popular image on docker hub
03:25 - about open - now let's see some options
03:29 - which are related to docker search so
03:32 - I'm going to just write docker search
03:35 - here and then I can give the filter
03:38 - option which we use to filter our
03:41 - results so I'm going to just write a
03:44 - filter here so let's say we want to
03:47 - filter our result on the basis of stars
03:50 - an image have on the docker hub so I can
03:54 - just write stars here is equal to 3 and
03:59 - then the name of an image I am searching
04:01 - for so for example I'm searching for
04:04 - Ubuntu here so I will just write open -
04:06 - and this example will display the images
04:11 - with the name open - and which have at
04:14 - least 3 stars I'm going to just press
04:17 - ENTER so you can see all the result of
04:20 - the images which have at least 3 stars
04:23 - now if you give here let's say in
04:27 - number of star is equal to hundred so
04:30 - it's going to search for all the images
04:33 - which have at least hundred stars now if
04:37 - you want to give more than one filter
04:39 - you can add this filter option once
04:43 - again so you can just right - - filter
04:47 - and then the next filter so the first
04:51 - filter we have here is for the stars and
04:56 - the second filter I have added here is
04:59 - for the official image so I just want
05:03 - all the images which are official so
05:07 - that's why I have just given this filter
05:10 - which is is official is equal to true
05:12 - and then I'm going to just press ENTER
05:14 - and I will only see the official images
05:19 - which are present on the docker hub and
05:21 - which have more than hundred stars in a
05:26 - similar way I can also search for
05:29 - automated image which are not official
05:32 - but which are there by some users which
05:37 - are there on docker hub right so it's
05:41 - going to show you all the images which
05:44 - are not official but automated now there
05:47 - is this option which is called no trunk
05:50 - also which is going to show you the
05:52 - description without truncating this
05:55 - description so right now you can see in
05:57 - the description you see this description
06:00 - and these three dots so that means this
06:04 - description have more content in the
06:08 - description so I can just give this
06:11 - option which is no trunk which is not
06:14 - going to truncate this description it's
06:17 - going to show you the full description
06:20 - here so sometimes this option can get
06:25 - really messy if the description is
06:28 - really large so just use it wisely
06:33 - now instead of for this - - filter you
06:36 - can also simply write hyphen F for the
06:41 - filter option so either you can just
06:44 - give the full filter option or you can
06:46 - just give - F for the filter and the
06:50 - result will be the same now the next
06:53 - command which I'm going to show you here
06:55 - is the docker images so I'm going to
06:58 - just write docker images and this
07:02 - command we use to list out all the local
07:06 - images you have on your hosts so when
07:11 - you give this command docker images it's
07:13 - going to give you all the images which
07:16 - you have on your hosts as I said and
07:18 - right now I only have one image which is
07:23 - hello world image which we have pulled
07:26 - in the previous videos when I have shown
07:29 - you how to install docker on your
07:32 - various operating system so right now I
07:35 - only have a one docker image which is
07:38 - hello world now there are some options
07:42 - which are related to docker images so we
07:46 - are going to see all those options one
07:48 - by one so with this docker images option
07:53 - you can give the name of the image now
07:56 - let's say I give here the option Java so
08:02 - you can list the images using the name
08:05 - or the tag so when you give this docker
08:08 - images Java command is going to search
08:11 - all the images related to Java and you
08:14 - can see there is no image which is
08:18 - related to Java on my host machine so
08:23 - let's pull that Java image from the
08:26 - docker hub so I'm going to just write
08:29 - docker here and then pull so the pull
08:34 - command you can use to pull an image or
08:36 - a repository from docker hub or from
08:39 - your private repository so I'm going to
08:42 - just pull the Java image from the docker
08:46 - hub so you can see when you give this
08:48 - docker pull Java command it's going to
08:51 - pull always the latest tagged
08:55 - image from the docker hub and in the
08:58 - output also you can see using default
09:00 - tag so the default tag is always the
09:03 - last test tag that's why it's going to
09:06 - pull the latest Java image so now you
09:11 - can see this Java image with the latest
09:15 - tag is downloaded on my host so let me
09:21 - clear the terminal and now I'm going to
09:25 - give the docker images command once
09:28 - again so docker images and now I have
09:34 - the Java image with the tag latest and
09:38 - the HelloWorld image with the tag latest
09:42 - so now I can use the docker images and
09:47 - then the name of the image also so I can
09:50 - search based on the name of the image
09:54 - also so I can just write docker images
09:57 - Java which is going to just give me the
10:01 - images which are related to Java I can
10:05 - also search with the image name and the
10:09 - tag so let's say I want to search for
10:11 - the Java image which have the tag let's
10:15 - say it which is not present on my host
10:20 - so it's going to give you the empty
10:23 - result without any image if you give the
10:28 - tag which is present so the latest tag
10:32 - is present on my host so it's going to
10:37 - give you the Java image with that latest
10:41 - tag so let me give the docker images
10:44 - command once again and you can see by
10:47 - default in the result you will see the
10:49 - name of the repository or an image then
10:52 - the tag of that image and then the image
10:56 - ID this ID is very useful when you have
11:00 - a multiple image related to let's say
11:05 - Java so you can use this image ID to
11:08 - remove the
11:08 - image or work with that image so that's
11:13 - why this ID is important also you can
11:17 - see when this image is created and the
11:21 - size of the image so the different
11:24 - images with different tag have different
11:27 - sizes so sometimes you want the images
11:30 - with the lesser size or sometimes you
11:35 - want the images which have the full
11:38 - feature so in that case you can use a
11:41 - different kind of image with different
11:45 - tag which suits your requirement for
11:48 - your application so that's it for this
11:50 - video in the next video we will see some
11:53 - more features about docker so stay tuned
11:56 - and I will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to the next video on docker tutorial for beginners in this video we will talk about how does docker works and we will see some commands related to docker and docker images so as I have told you in the earlier videos also you can build your docker images that holds your applications using docker files and then you can create your docker containers from those docker images to run your applications and then you can share your docker images via docker hub or via your private registry now if you want to see this docker flow in the form of a diagram you can see this diagram here so you can create a docker file which we are going to see how we can create a docker file in the later videos so docker file is a file from which you can build your applications into docker images so what happens is you pull some images which are already there on the docker hub and you use those images with your application and you write all that code or that script inside your docker file so how will your application run inside a container you write everything in a docker file and then you build your docker file which will create a docker image and when you run your docker image it will be converted to a docker container now let's see some commands related to docker so the first command which I want to show you is the docker search command so you just write docker search and then you give your options for example whatever image you want to fetch from your docker hub you can just write that image name for example I just write Ubuntu here so you can search all the images which are there related to open to on docker hub using this command so docker search Ubuntu so when you give docker search open to you will see this kind of result in the form of our table and the first column here is the name the second column here is the description third is the number of stars and if the image have more number of stars then it's more popular also you have the column for official so if you see okay under official for a particular image so for example this first image with the name open is the official image on docker hub and you can also see some description here so clearly this first image which is an official image also is the most popular image on docker hub about open now let's see some options which are related to docker search so I'm going to just write docker search here and then I can give the filter option which we use to filter our results so I'm going to just write a filter here so let's say we want to filter our result on the basis of stars an image have on the docker hub so I can just write stars here is equal to 3 and then the name of an image I am searching for so for example I'm searching for Ubuntu here so I will just write open and this example will display the images with the name open and which have at least 3 stars I'm going to just press ENTER so you can see all the result of the images which have at least 3 stars now if you give here let's say in number of star is equal to hundred so it's going to search for all the images which have at least hundred stars now if you want to give more than one filter you can add this filter option once again so you can just right filter and then the next filter so the first filter we have here is for the stars and the second filter I have added here is for the official image so I just want all the images which are official so that's why I have just given this filter which is is official is equal to true and then I'm going to just press ENTER and I will only see the official images which are present on the docker hub and which have more than hundred stars in a similar way I can also search for automated image which are not official but which are there by some users which are there on docker hub right so it's going to show you all the images which are not official but automated now there is this option which is called no trunk also which is going to show you the description without truncating this description so right now you can see in the description you see this description and these three dots so that means this description have more content in the description so I can just give this option which is no trunk which is not going to truncate this description it's going to show you the full description here so sometimes this option can get really messy if the description is really large so just use it wisely now instead of for this filter you can also simply write hyphen F for the filter option so either you can just give the full filter option or you can just give F for the filter and the result will be the same now the next command which I'm going to show you here is the docker images so I'm going to just write docker images and this command we use to list out all the local images you have on your hosts so when you give this command docker images it's going to give you all the images which you have on your hosts as I said and right now I only have one image which is hello world image which we have pulled in the previous videos when I have shown you how to install docker on your various operating system so right now I only have a one docker image which is hello world now there are some options which are related to docker images so we are going to see all those options one by one so with this docker images option you can give the name of the image now let's say I give here the option Java so you can list the images using the name or the tag so when you give this docker images Java command is going to search all the images related to Java and you can see there is no image which is related to Java on my host machine so let's pull that Java image from the docker hub so I'm going to just write docker here and then pull so the pull command you can use to pull an image or a repository from docker hub or from your private repository so I'm going to just pull the Java image from the docker hub so you can see when you give this docker pull Java command it's going to pull always the latest tagged image from the docker hub and in the output also you can see using default tag so the default tag is always the last test tag that's why it's going to pull the latest Java image so now you can see this Java image with the latest tag is downloaded on my host so let me clear the terminal and now I'm going to give the docker images command once again so docker images and now I have the Java image with the tag latest and the HelloWorld image with the tag latest so now I can use the docker images and then the name of the image also so I can search based on the name of the image also so I can just write docker images Java which is going to just give me the images which are related to Java I can also search with the image name and the tag so let's say I want to search for the Java image which have the tag let's say it which is not present on my host so it's going to give you the empty result without any image if you give the tag which is present so the latest tag is present on my host so it's going to give you the Java image with that latest tag so let me give the docker images command once again and you can see by default in the result you will see the name of the repository or an image then the tag of that image and then the image ID this ID is very useful when you have a multiple image related to let's say Java so you can use this image ID to remove the image or work with that image so that's why this ID is important also you can see when this image is created and the size of the image so the different images with different tag have different sizes so sometimes you want the images with the lesser size or sometimes you want the images which have the full feature so in that case you can use a different kind of image with different tag which suits your requirement for your application so that's it for this video in the next video we will see some more features about docker so stay tuned and I will see you in the next video
