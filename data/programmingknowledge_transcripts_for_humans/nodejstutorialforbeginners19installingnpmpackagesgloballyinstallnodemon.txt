00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - node.js tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:06 - install and download node modules
00:09 - globally on your operating system right
00:13 - so till now what we have seen is how to
00:16 - you know install node modules locally so
00:20 - whenever you install a module a
00:22 - directory called node module is created
00:26 - and then your you know
00:28 - module is installed inside this
00:30 - directory right but if you want to use
00:33 - the node module in different project the
00:36 - same node module you want to use in
00:39 - different projects then you need to
00:41 - install a node module globally this is
00:45 - not a good practice unless it's you know
00:49 - a module which helps you to develop your
00:52 - you know project but sometimes some
00:56 - modules when you installed globally
00:58 - helps you in the development and one
01:01 - such module is node Mon right so first
01:06 - of all I'm going to open the terminal
01:08 - inside my visual studio quotes so I will
01:12 - just write tog the integrated terminal
01:17 - and it's going to open it and I'm going
01:20 - to run my app first of all so I will
01:22 - just write and note app dot J's right
01:27 - and this is the app we were making in
01:31 - the previous videos for routing yeah
01:34 - different request okay so what is node
01:38 - one first of all so node Mon you can go
01:42 - to the NPM website and search for node 1
01:45 - and node 1 allows you to you know
01:49 - develop your project in such a way that
01:52 - whenever you run your project with node
01:56 - Mon command of the installing node moon
01:59 - it will watch your file so whenever you
02:02 - change your stuff in your project it's
02:06 - going to you know watch for the changes
02:09 - and as soon as you press the Save button
02:11 - is going to restart
02:13 - your server so right now what we do is
02:16 - when we make some changes for example I
02:19 - add a comma here I need to stop my
02:21 - server from here and save my code and
02:25 - restart my server in order to you know
02:28 - let the changes happen right but in the
02:31 - development this can be really I mean
02:34 - tiring to restart and stop and restart
02:37 - your server so note Mon whenever you
02:41 - install it globally will help you to
02:44 - watch your files if you change your file
02:47 - it's going to restart the node server
02:51 - automatically so first of all let's see
02:53 - how we can install node Mon okay so the
02:58 - command to install the node Mon is NPM
03:01 - install so just write NPM install and
03:05 - then node Mon and then give a flag - gee
03:12 - now flag - G stands for global flag so
03:17 - whatever command or whatever module you
03:21 - install with - G flag it will be
03:24 - installed globally so it's not going to
03:27 - installed in your node module folder
03:29 - inside your you know project it's not
03:33 - going to install here but it's going to
03:37 - installed globally on your operating
03:39 - system so whenever you want to use this
03:43 - node Mon module from other project also
03:46 - you can use it right so it's not going
03:49 - to be installed locally but globally so
03:52 - just give this command NPM install node
03:54 - Mon - G and press Enter which is going
03:57 - to install this node Mon if you are on
04:00 - Linux operating system you may have to
04:03 - give sudo command sudo access to install
04:08 - this because the directory where this
04:10 - global module will be installed is
04:14 - protected for the root user right so if
04:17 - you are on linux operating system just
04:19 - run this command with sudo ok so once
04:23 - this you know module is installed you
04:26 - can see here
04:27 - it's not installed here nothing is here
04:29 - in my node modules right but it's
04:32 - installed at a specific location on
04:35 - Windows this location is this one so I'm
04:40 - going to just paste this command in the
04:43 - description so just copy this command
04:46 - and open your folder Explorer and then
04:49 - just paste this command like this okay
04:52 - in here and then press ENTER and it will
04:55 - be you know showing you the location
05:00 - where your global module is installed so
05:03 - you can see node 1 is already there
05:06 - I have other global module called node
05:08 - inspector which I have already
05:10 - previously installed right so this is
05:13 - the global location your user name and
05:15 - in app data roaming there will be a
05:20 - folder called NPM slash node modules so
05:24 - this is the global location of node
05:26 - modules and every project you will make
05:29 - will be able to see this module right so
05:33 - I'm going to give this command in the
05:35 - description so you can also see this ok
05:38 - so once the node 1 is you know installed
05:42 - you can see in the documentation also
05:45 - you can install it globally like this
05:47 - then you just need to write node 1 and
05:50 - the name of your app dot JS file so just
05:54 - write instead of node just write node
05:57 - Mon here okay so let me just clear it a
06:02 - little bit so we can see it clearly so
06:06 - here we are going to give node Mon
06:09 - command instead of node give node Mon
06:12 - this command node Mon and then the app
06:16 - dot JS file name so app dot chase right
06:20 - and then press enter and you can see
06:24 - your server on the browser which we have
06:27 - made so we are right now in the home
06:29 - page and for example I want to change
06:32 - this routing instead of about us I want
06:37 - to use for example instead of about I
06:39 - want
06:40 - just write about us here so I want to
06:43 - show the about page on this URL about -
06:48 - us okay and I'm going to save it and as
06:51 - soon as I save it you can see the node
06:56 - mon server sees that I have saved a file
06:59 - so it has restarted the server again so
07:03 - you can see we starting due to changes
07:06 - starting node AB dot J's right so the
07:10 - server is restarted whenever I press the
07:13 - Save button right or for example I will
07:16 - just go here file and I will just press
07:19 - save right and you can see it restart
07:22 - when I you know save my code okay and
07:26 - then I can go to my browser and when I
07:31 - just say about here instead of this
07:36 - about and it's going to give me 4 0 4
07:40 - because I have already changed the URL
07:42 - to about us so I will just give about us
07:46 - this time
07:47 - it should be about up up I have given
07:51 - here right so I will just say about up
07:54 - and I can see the about page right
07:58 - ideally it should be like this about us
08:01 - and I will just say save it's going to
08:04 - restart and this time when i refresh it
08:07 - now it shows me 4 0 4 and when I say
08:12 - about us it gives me about page right so
08:16 - this makes your development really easy
08:18 - when ever you want to you know
08:20 - frequently change your code on your
08:23 - project right so in this way you can
08:26 - install global modules on in your
08:28 - operating system and in this way you can
08:31 - use known one with your node GS server
08:33 - so I hope you have enjoyed this video
08:35 - please welcome and subscribe and bye for
08:37 - now
