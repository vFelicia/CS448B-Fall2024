00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install and use NG rock
00:04 - on your Ubuntu operating system
00:06 - so for those of you who don't know what
00:09 - is NG Rock and g-rock is a tool that
00:12 - provides a secure tunneling to your
00:15 - local development environment or server
00:17 - so basically it allows you to expose a
00:21 - local server for example you are running
00:25 - a local server on your Ubuntu operating
00:28 - system
00:29 - and you want to expose it to the
00:31 - internet
00:32 - so basically it allows you to expose
00:35 - your local server that is making it
00:38 - accessible for testing or debugging
00:41 - purposes right so if you have a
00:43 - application which is running locally on
00:46 - localhost on your Ubuntu operating
00:50 - system you can expose it on internet and
00:54 - test it over internet right
00:57 - so let's see how we can install NG Rock
01:01 - so first of all open your favorite
01:03 - browser and search for NG Rock and the
01:05 - first link which will appear here will
01:07 - be NG Rock
01:08 - and when you go inside this website you
01:12 - will be able to see this download
01:15 - button here now NG Rock has a pricing
01:20 - model also
01:22 - so for developers which are bringing the
01:26 - new projects to life it's uh free to use
01:29 - that means we can test our applications
01:33 - and in testing phase we can use it for
01:37 - free but if you want to use it regularly
01:41 - or for Enterprise use you need to pay so
01:44 - we are going to use the
01:46 - free version here
01:47 - so just click on download here and then
01:50 - click on Linux
01:52 - and there are few different ways of
01:54 - installing uh NG rock on your Ubuntu
01:59 - operating system so when you will scroll
02:01 - down you can see this method install
02:03 - ngoc via snap so if you are running the
02:07 - latest version of Ubuntu it comes with
02:10 - the snap package manager and using this
02:15 - snap package manager you can install NG
02:18 - Rock very easily by using this single
02:21 - command which is snap install NG Rock
02:23 - which is uh what we are going to use
02:27 - so let me open the terminal just press
02:29 - Ctrl alt t for that
02:31 - and then here we are going to give this
02:35 - command which is snap install and G Rock
02:37 - but we are going to run it with the
02:40 - pseudo privileges so I'm going to just
02:42 - write sudo
02:44 - snap install
02:47 - NG Rock here and then give my ubuntu's
02:51 - password and then press enter
02:53 - which is going to
02:55 - install NG rock on your Ubuntu operating
02:58 - system so just wait for few seconds
03:03 - and once NG rock is installed you need
03:06 - to log into the ngrok website to get the
03:11 - authentication token right
03:13 - once you get this authentication token
03:16 - you can test it via
03:18 - this command which is NG Rock HTTP 80.
03:24 - so let's check it first and let's see
03:26 - what it does so I'm going to give this
03:28 - command
03:30 - and you can see it has already started
03:33 - the tunnel for my local host and now I
03:37 - can use my local host on this URL which
03:42 - is this one right so I can just copy
03:46 - this URL and open it on my browser
03:51 - and once I open it on my browser it's
03:55 - going to uh just show me this kind of
03:58 - interface and what it says it says
04:01 - error NG Rock because we haven't
04:04 - authenticated the NG rock using the NG
04:07 - rock out token right so for that you can
04:11 - click on the sign up
04:13 - button which is on the NG Rock download
04:17 - website itself you can see add
04:20 - authentication and you have the sign up
04:22 - button or you can click on this button
04:27 - also which is also going to just
04:29 - redirect you to sign up page here you
04:32 - need to give three things
04:34 - name email and password which is simple
04:36 - so let me create a new account here and
04:39 - once you give your email and password
04:43 - you will be redirected to this page
04:47 - which says welcome to NG Rock here you
04:49 - can add your role so for example I'm
04:52 - going to select app developer and then I
04:56 - will use NG Rock to access the software
04:59 - for example and then my own network here
05:03 - and then for my Developers for customers
05:07 - myself so I want to use it for myself
05:10 - right so I will just select myself and
05:12 - then click on continue
05:14 - and then you have this kind of interface
05:18 - here right
05:19 - so you can see now here that there is
05:24 - this command which is available which is
05:27 - NG Rock config add authentication and
05:31 - then you can give this authentication
05:33 - token so just copy this command and then
05:37 - paste it on your terminal which is going
05:40 - to
05:40 - authenticate your NG Rock right so I'm
05:45 - going to clear the terminal and then
05:48 - give this command and then press enter
05:51 - which is going to give me this kind of
05:53 - output which says authentication saved
05:56 - to configuration and this is the path to
06:00 - your NCO configuration so uh if you want
06:04 - to see your configuration file it's in
06:08 - this location
06:10 - so once again we are going to give this
06:13 - command which is ngoc HTTP 80 which
06:16 - means that means we are exposing Port 80
06:19 - for our Local Host to the outside
06:23 - internet using NG Rock so I'm going to
06:25 - press once again enter and now this time
06:28 - it says you need to verify your account
06:31 - so there is this authentication email
06:35 - which will be sent to your email address
06:37 - and you need to click on verify before
06:41 - running this command so I just verified
06:44 - my email account by clicking on the URL
06:47 - which is sent by NG Rock and once again
06:49 - let me clear the terminal and run that
06:52 - command once again
06:53 - and this time it works so before using
06:57 - NG rock you need to authenticate your NG
07:01 - rock with your out token using this
07:05 - command which I have shown you which is
07:07 - NG Rock config add authentication and
07:10 - then your authentication token
07:13 - so you can see you are online now I can
07:17 - click on this uh URL so I'm going to
07:21 - just press control and then click on
07:23 - this URL which is going to open the URL
07:26 - on my default browser and now my Local
07:32 - Host Port 80 is exposed to internet so
07:36 - now everything is working but what's the
07:39 - Practical use of exposing this
07:41 - so let's say I'm a developer I have
07:44 - created a very simple server
07:47 - so I have the sample node.js server
07:50 - which is running on Port 3000.
07:54 - you can find this basic node.js code
07:57 - anywhere basically what it does is it
08:01 - runs on localhost Port 3000 and when I
08:04 - open this uh localhost Port 3008 Prince
08:08 - hello world and I want to expose this
08:12 - server which is running on my Local Host
08:14 - you can see
08:16 - 127.0.0.1 colon 3000 I want to expose
08:21 - this to the Internet so using the
08:26 - internet I want to just give this uh URL
08:31 - for my local server which is running
08:34 - locally to my friend to test it right
08:37 - on his computer
08:40 - so what I can do here is now
08:43 - so let me just press Ctrl C to come out
08:46 - of the NG Rock and here once again
08:49 - instead of Port 80 I can write 3000 here
08:55 - so NG Rock HTTP 3000 because I want to
09:00 - now expose the port 3000 where my server
09:04 - is running on the Local Host that's why
09:07 - I'm just giving 3000 here and then press
09:09 - enter and now my port 3000 is exposed to
09:14 - internet
09:16 - you have this URL here
09:19 - so now
09:20 - when I click on this URL
09:24 - you will see uh this kind of message and
09:27 - then I can click on visit website and
09:31 - you can see
09:33 - my localhost server which is running on
09:36 - Port 3000 is now available
09:39 - via this URL to others if I share this
09:44 - URL with my friend he can use this URL
09:48 - and test my local server which is
09:52 - running locally on my Ubuntu operating
09:56 - system and see how it's responding
10:00 - so in the development phase this tool is
10:04 - very useful when you want to share or
10:07 - test or expose your local application to
10:11 - internet to test something or debug
10:14 - something
10:15 - so that's how you can install and use NG
10:18 - rock on your Ubuntu operating system I
10:21 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
10:22 - will see you in the next video
