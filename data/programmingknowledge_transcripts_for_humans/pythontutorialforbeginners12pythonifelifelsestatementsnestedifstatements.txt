00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video in
00:02 - python tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video I've shown you how to use if
00:06 - statements and L statements in Python
00:09 - now in this video I'm going to show you
00:12 - how to use L if statement with if-else
00:15 - statements and how to use nested if
00:18 - statements in Python so let's get
00:21 - started so what I'm going to do is I'm
00:23 - going to declare a variable and I'm
00:25 - going to ask the user to enter some name
00:29 - so I'm going to just write and the name
00:34 - here and when the user enters this name
00:38 - I want to compare this name with some
00:42 - predefined names so in the last video we
00:45 - have already seen how to use if
00:47 - statement so I can just write name is
00:51 - equal to and I can compare it with some
00:53 - names so let's compare it with a name
00:55 - called max here and I will give the
00:58 - Kulin here and once the name matches
01:01 - this name I'm going to print the name so
01:04 - I'm going to just write name and third
01:07 - is and whatever the name provided by the
01:11 - user so I will just use this name
01:13 - variable here this we have already seen
01:17 - in the last video now in Python you can
01:20 - also use a L if statement and the
01:23 - signature of L is if statement is you
01:26 - can just write L if here and then you
01:29 - can provide some other condition which
01:32 - returns boolean so I can once again here
01:36 - right if the name matches some other
01:40 - name for example Leo and once again I'm
01:43 - going to just print the name entered by
01:46 - the user and this L if condition I can
01:50 - use any number of time after the if let
01:54 - me match this name to some other
01:57 - different names for example Roy and the
02:01 - last name will be a li so if the name
02:05 - matches max this statement will be
02:08 - executed if the name matches Leo this
02:12 - statement will be exist
02:13 - if the name matches Roy this statement
02:16 - will be executed and if the name matches
02:18 - le this statement will be executed now
02:21 - if the name entered by the user does not
02:24 - matches any of these names then we can
02:28 - use else statements so we can just write
02:32 - else here and we can just print a
02:36 - message here so the name entered is
02:38 - invalid so this message will be printed
02:41 - when the name entered by the user does
02:44 - not match any of the name I am checking
02:47 - here so let's run the code and let's see
02:50 - what happens so now my code is running
02:53 - and I'm going to give the name of max
02:55 - here for example and then press Enter
02:58 - and it prints this message which says
03:01 - the name entered is max using this
03:04 - statement now once again when I run the
03:07 - program and this name matches let's say
03:12 - some other name le and then when I press
03:15 - ENTER it prints the name entered is Ali
03:18 - which means this statement is executed
03:21 - and let me run the program once again
03:25 - and when I give some random string here
03:28 - it prints the name entered is invalid
03:32 - now let's say the name entered by the
03:34 - user is max and this condition evaluates
03:38 - to true then this statement will be
03:40 - executed and the other conditions which
03:43 - we have given using Elif statement will
03:47 - not be evaluated so let's say we will
03:51 - write max here also so this condition
03:54 - and this condition is same rights
03:57 - checking for the same name and when I
03:59 - run the program and when I write max
04:02 - here only one statement is printed which
04:05 - is this one so we can see when this
04:08 - condition returns true only one
04:11 - statement is executed and none of the
04:14 - other conditions are even evaluated now
04:18 - the important thing to note here is you
04:20 - cannot start with L if statement you
04:24 - need to start with the if
04:27 - statement so you need to write a if
04:29 - statement and check the condition first
04:31 - and then only you will be able to write
04:34 - L if condition now it's possible to use
04:38 - multiple if condition and then this l if
04:43 - will become the part of this if
04:45 - condition and this will be the separate
04:48 - if condition so when I run the code once
04:52 - again and when I write Maxia is going to
04:56 - print two statements one is using this
05:00 - and other is using this because this if
05:04 - condition and this if condition are two
05:07 - different if conditions and once you use
05:10 - L if so I'm going to use LF here then
05:14 - this LF is the part of this if condition
05:18 - so this is how you can use if statement
05:21 - with L if statement and as statement now
05:25 - let's see how to use the nested if
05:28 - statement so I'm going to declare a
05:31 - variable called X and the value I will
05:34 - assign to X is 10 and then I'm going to
05:37 - write an if condition and here I'm going
05:40 - to just evaluate whether X is less than
05:44 - 0 and when X is less than 0 I am going
05:48 - to just print that X is negative else if
05:52 - the value is not less than 0 so I'm
05:56 - going to just write else then I'm going
05:58 - to just print X is positive now let's
06:02 - say I also want to evaluate if the x
06:04 - value is even number or an odd number if
06:08 - the x value is positive so under the
06:12 - else I can once again write if and then
06:16 - we can just evaluate this condition that
06:21 - if X modulo 2 is equal to 0 which means
06:28 - that when X modulo 2 returns us 0 that
06:33 - means it's our even number so we can
06:36 - print X is even otherwise in the
06:40 - condition I can just write else X is odd
06:45 - so in this if condition I'm checking if
06:48 - the value of x is less than zero or not
06:51 - and if this condition is not satisfied
06:53 - then I am checking whether X is a even
06:58 - number or X is an odd number so if you
07:01 - remember indentation here is very
07:04 - important so this if condition falls
07:08 - under the else condition right so this
07:12 - if condition and this else is the part
07:16 - of the else statement so because we have
07:19 - provided this force space indent here
07:22 - whatever code you write with this indent
07:26 - is a block of code and what we are
07:29 - essentially doing here is we are nesting
07:31 - one if-else condition inside the other
07:35 - if-else condition you can also reverse
07:37 - this condition checking and you can also
07:39 - say if X is greater than or equal to 0
07:44 - then the value of X is positive
07:48 - otherwise the value of x is negative and
07:51 - this statement you can write under the
07:56 - if condition also and this is also a
07:59 - nested if-else statement and let me run
08:02 - this program and you can see x is a
08:06 - positive value because x is equal to 10
08:09 - and x is a even values so once this
08:13 - condition is true this statement will be
08:17 - printed and whatever if condition is
08:20 - there inside the parent if statement
08:23 - that will also be executed and this
08:26 - condition is checked first of all and
08:28 - obviously this condition is true in this
08:31 - case when X is equal to 10 because when
08:34 - you do X modulo 2 its going to give us
08:36 - the remainder 0 and that's why X is even
08:41 - value and that's why it's printing X is
08:44 - even here so it's totally possible to
08:47 - use one FL statement inside the other FL
08:51 - statement and this type of FL statement
08:54 - are called nested if-else statements so
08:58 - that's it for this video I hope you have
09:01 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
09:03 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to the next video in python tutorial for beginners in the last video I've shown you how to use if statements and L statements in Python now in this video I'm going to show you how to use L if statement with ifelse statements and how to use nested if statements in Python so let's get started so what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare a variable and I'm going to ask the user to enter some name so I'm going to just write and the name here and when the user enters this name I want to compare this name with some predefined names so in the last video we have already seen how to use if statement so I can just write name is equal to and I can compare it with some names so let's compare it with a name called max here and I will give the Kulin here and once the name matches this name I'm going to print the name so I'm going to just write name and third is and whatever the name provided by the user so I will just use this name variable here this we have already seen in the last video now in Python you can also use a L if statement and the signature of L is if statement is you can just write L if here and then you can provide some other condition which returns boolean so I can once again here right if the name matches some other name for example Leo and once again I'm going to just print the name entered by the user and this L if condition I can use any number of time after the if let me match this name to some other different names for example Roy and the last name will be a li so if the name matches max this statement will be executed if the name matches Leo this statement will be exist if the name matches Roy this statement will be executed and if the name matches le this statement will be executed now if the name entered by the user does not matches any of these names then we can use else statements so we can just write else here and we can just print a message here so the name entered is invalid so this message will be printed when the name entered by the user does not match any of the name I am checking here so let's run the code and let's see what happens so now my code is running and I'm going to give the name of max here for example and then press Enter and it prints this message which says the name entered is max using this statement now once again when I run the program and this name matches let's say some other name le and then when I press ENTER it prints the name entered is Ali which means this statement is executed and let me run the program once again and when I give some random string here it prints the name entered is invalid now let's say the name entered by the user is max and this condition evaluates to true then this statement will be executed and the other conditions which we have given using Elif statement will not be evaluated so let's say we will write max here also so this condition and this condition is same rights checking for the same name and when I run the program and when I write max here only one statement is printed which is this one so we can see when this condition returns true only one statement is executed and none of the other conditions are even evaluated now the important thing to note here is you cannot start with L if statement you need to start with the if statement so you need to write a if statement and check the condition first and then only you will be able to write L if condition now it's possible to use multiple if condition and then this l if will become the part of this if condition and this will be the separate if condition so when I run the code once again and when I write Maxia is going to print two statements one is using this and other is using this because this if condition and this if condition are two different if conditions and once you use L if so I'm going to use LF here then this LF is the part of this if condition so this is how you can use if statement with L if statement and as statement now let's see how to use the nested if statement so I'm going to declare a variable called X and the value I will assign to X is 10 and then I'm going to write an if condition and here I'm going to just evaluate whether X is less than 0 and when X is less than 0 I am going to just print that X is negative else if the value is not less than 0 so I'm going to just write else then I'm going to just print X is positive now let's say I also want to evaluate if the x value is even number or an odd number if the x value is positive so under the else I can once again write if and then we can just evaluate this condition that if X modulo 2 is equal to 0 which means that when X modulo 2 returns us 0 that means it's our even number so we can print X is even otherwise in the condition I can just write else X is odd so in this if condition I'm checking if the value of x is less than zero or not and if this condition is not satisfied then I am checking whether X is a even number or X is an odd number so if you remember indentation here is very important so this if condition falls under the else condition right so this if condition and this else is the part of the else statement so because we have provided this force space indent here whatever code you write with this indent is a block of code and what we are essentially doing here is we are nesting one ifelse condition inside the other ifelse condition you can also reverse this condition checking and you can also say if X is greater than or equal to 0 then the value of X is positive otherwise the value of x is negative and this statement you can write under the if condition also and this is also a nested ifelse statement and let me run this program and you can see x is a positive value because x is equal to 10 and x is a even values so once this condition is true this statement will be printed and whatever if condition is there inside the parent if statement that will also be executed and this condition is checked first of all and obviously this condition is true in this case when X is equal to 10 because when you do X modulo 2 its going to give us the remainder 0 and that's why X is even value and that's why it's printing X is even here so it's totally possible to use one FL statement inside the other FL statement and this type of FL statement are called nested ifelse statements so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
