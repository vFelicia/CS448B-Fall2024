00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use alert dialog box on our
00:09 - Android activity alert dialogue box you
00:13 - can use to alert the user for some
00:17 - action for example uh by clicking some
00:20 - button user can decide if you want to uh
00:24 - you know close your application or not
00:27 - so let's get started and uh I I will
00:30 - just take a button to open this alert
00:33 - dialogue and I will change the name of
00:36 - this button as alert for example now I'm
00:40 - going to go to my uh main activity. Java
00:45 - and in here I'm going to create a button
00:48 - variable so
00:52 - private
00:56 - static
00:58 - button
01:01 - button
01:02 - underscore SPM for button submit okay
01:06 - and now we are going to create a method
01:10 - which we will call on button click
01:13 - events
01:15 - so
01:18 - public
01:20 - void
01:23 - on
01:25 - button
01:28 - click
01:32 - listener and in here inside this method
01:36 - I'm going to cast my
01:39 - button submit variable which is uh this
01:43 - variable which I have
01:45 - declared and I will assign the ID to it
01:51 - so
01:52 - button
01:54 - find view by ID r. ID do
02:00 - the ID of the button okay now I'm going
02:04 - to use this uh button to set uh onclick
02:10 - event okay so button
02:13 - dot set onclick listener and inside this
02:18 - uh function we will create a
02:22 - new onclick
02:24 - listener and inside this onclick
02:27 - listener we are going to create uh alert
02:31 - dialogue okay so let's create alert
02:35 - dialogue alert
02:38 - dialogue and we will name it as
02:42 - uh alert for example alert variable so
02:46 - alert dialog.
02:49 - Builder with capital
02:56 - B and we name it as
03:03 - a builder for example is equal to
03:08 - new alert
03:14 - Builder alert
03:17 - dialogue.
03:19 - Builder and we are going to create this
03:23 - alert dialog box on this activity so we
03:27 - will just assign it to this class
03:30 - and
03:32 - now in here we are going to create a
03:37 - message for this Builder so I'm going to
03:41 - copy this uh variable which is a
03:45 - builder and then we will call set
03:50 - message method on this Builder so
03:55 - set
03:57 - message and inside this set message we
04:01 - can uh you know call some uh
04:06 - uh message inside this set message so in
04:10 - double Cotes for example we can display
04:12 - a message do
04:15 - you want
04:19 - to
04:20 - close this app
04:24 - okay and if the user want he can close
04:28 - it so uh we will provide the some a
04:33 - method to this alert box for example
04:39 - set cancel lab and this should this
04:45 - alert box should not be cancelable so we
04:48 - will just set it as
04:50 - false and
04:53 - then so let's uh shift it to the next
04:57 - line so that we can see it better
05:00 - and
05:02 - then after this we have set the cancel
05:07 - uh button to false and then now we are
05:11 - going to set the positive button for
05:14 - example yes if uh in condition if that
05:19 - condition arises that uh we want to
05:22 - display yes or no uh condition or button
05:25 - on this alert dialogue box then uh how
05:29 - we can do it so
05:31 - set positive button and in this uh it
05:36 - takes some arguments so when you hover
05:39 - over this U method you will be able to
05:43 - see that it can take some argument or
05:48 - you can just directly hover over this
05:50 - and uh click inside this method and it
05:54 - will show what are the argument it it
05:58 - takes so the first argument it takes is
06:01 - the title or text of this uh yes button
06:05 - so we we will just give yes to
06:09 - it and the second uh argument which it
06:13 - takes is the on click list now because
06:16 - it's a button so that we can set on
06:20 - click listen on this button so we can
06:22 - set positive button and negative button
06:26 - for two condition if the condition is
06:28 - true or condition is false okay so the
06:33 - next is the new on click
06:39 - listener and in this on click listener
06:42 - it will create a onclick method for you
06:45 - automatically and in here you just need
06:47 - to call Finish okay Finish method just
06:53 - uh closes your app gracefully so if the
06:55 - user wants to close the app he can click
06:59 - this yes yes button and it will close
07:01 - your app gracefully otherwise just go uh
07:05 - outside this set positive button and
07:08 - just go below that and Dot set negative
07:12 - button and we can set negative condition
07:15 - also and the first argument of this is
07:18 - the text on this button second argument
07:21 - is the onclick method so new onclick
07:26 - listener and in here also we can uh call
07:31 - a method to cancel this dialogue box so
07:35 - in here you can see this dialogue
07:37 - variable inside this onclick U uh method
07:42 - so just call this dialog do cancel and
07:45 - this will close your alert right and now
07:50 - outside this uh negative button I will
07:52 - just
07:56 - give this semicolon here so that that we
08:01 - can close this method so what we have uh
08:04 - done basically here is we have uh
08:08 - created a method and inside this method
08:12 - we have created a button variable and we
08:16 - have casted it and we have taken the ID
08:19 - of this button and then we call uh on
08:23 - this button set on this onclick listener
08:27 - new onclick listener and inside this on
08:29 - click of this main button we have uh
08:32 - created our builder for the alert uh
08:36 - dialogue right and on this alert Builder
08:40 - variable here we have called set message
08:43 - so this is the message it's going to uh
08:45 - display the second method we have called
08:48 - is set cancellable so it's uh not going
08:52 - to show any cancel button so we have set
08:55 - it to false then we have called set
08:58 - positive so this is the positive button
09:00 - it's going to show this alert dialogue
09:03 - and the text it's going to show is yes
09:05 - and on click uh event of this uh button
09:10 - we are just closing our app gracefully
09:14 - otherwise we have set the negative
09:17 - button for the negative condition and we
09:20 - will uh just close this app uh close
09:23 - this alert dialogue Box by calling this
09:27 - button uh this method called dialog.
09:30 - cancel
09:31 - okay and I think uh in here where I have
09:35 - defined alert dialog. Builder aore
09:38 - Builder is equal to new alert dialogue
09:41 - in here I must
09:44 - uh remove this uh brackets from here and
09:49 - instead of this we can just
09:53 - call we can just call the name of our
09:56 - activity class which is Main activity
10:00 - and then we can call this on Main
10:03 - activity so in here after
10:06 - Builder just before
10:09 - this this you just need to write main
10:13 - activity do this okay so now we have
10:16 - created our Builder right just below
10:20 - this uh Builder method or build a code
10:25 - just below this we are going to create
10:27 - our alert dialog now so alert
10:32 - dialogue and we will name it as
10:37 - alert is equal to and now we will
10:42 - uh take our builder for the alert
10:45 - dialogue and we will create a new alert
10:48 - so alert Builder do create right after
10:54 - this this from this alert dialogue
10:57 - instance you can can set the title on
11:00 - this uh alert box for
11:05 - example
11:08 - alert and then you can call show method
11:13 - to show this alert dialog box so alert
11:16 - dot show okay so now your code is
11:22 - complete so we can uh call this method
11:25 - inside our on create method so this is
11:29 - was our method uh so just copy this
11:32 - method and inside your on create method
11:36 - you can call this method so just paste
11:39 - this method inside your on create method
11:42 - now I'm going to run my
11:44 - application so my application is running
11:49 - now and this is my alert button so when
11:52 - I click this alert button
11:55 - here a new alert dialogue box appears
11:59 - right the title of this alert is alert
12:02 - which we have set and uh this is the
12:05 - message which we have set do you want to
12:07 - close this app right and there are two
12:10 - buttons no and yes for example we click
12:13 - no button nothing happens just uh uh
12:16 - this alert dialog box uh closes right
12:20 - now once again I'm going to open this
12:22 - alert dialogue and this time I will
12:25 - click this yes and when I click yes it
12:28 - gracefully uh closes my app right once
12:32 - again I will uh start my app open it no
12:36 - nothing happens it just closes the alert
12:39 - dialogue and yes it closes my app so in
12:43 - this way you can use alert dialogue in
12:47 - your Android activity I hope you enjoyed

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use alert dialog box on our Android activity alert dialogue box you can use to alert the user for some action for example uh by clicking some button user can decide if you want to uh you know close your application or not so let's get started and uh I I will just take a button to open this alert dialogue and I will change the name of this button as alert for example now I'm going to go to my uh main activity. Java and in here I'm going to create a button variable so private static button button underscore SPM for button submit okay and now we are going to create a method which we will call on button click events so public void on button click listener and in here inside this method I'm going to cast my button submit variable which is uh this variable which I have declared and I will assign the ID to it so button find view by ID r. ID do the ID of the button okay now I'm going to use this uh button to set uh onclick event okay so button dot set onclick listener and inside this uh function we will create a new onclick listener and inside this onclick listener we are going to create uh alert dialogue okay so let's create alert dialogue alert dialogue and we will name it as uh alert for example alert variable so alert dialog. Builder with capital B and we name it as a builder for example is equal to new alert Builder alert dialogue. Builder and we are going to create this alert dialog box on this activity so we will just assign it to this class and now in here we are going to create a message for this Builder so I'm going to copy this uh variable which is a builder and then we will call set message method on this Builder so set message and inside this set message we can uh you know call some uh uh message inside this set message so in double Cotes for example we can display a message do you want to close this app okay and if the user want he can close it so uh we will provide the some a method to this alert box for example set cancel lab and this should this alert box should not be cancelable so we will just set it as false and then so let's uh shift it to the next line so that we can see it better and then after this we have set the cancel uh button to false and then now we are going to set the positive button for example yes if uh in condition if that condition arises that uh we want to display yes or no uh condition or button on this alert dialogue box then uh how we can do it so set positive button and in this uh it takes some arguments so when you hover over this U method you will be able to see that it can take some argument or you can just directly hover over this and uh click inside this method and it will show what are the argument it it takes so the first argument it takes is the title or text of this uh yes button so we we will just give yes to it and the second uh argument which it takes is the on click list now because it's a button so that we can set on click listen on this button so we can set positive button and negative button for two condition if the condition is true or condition is false okay so the next is the new on click listener and in this on click listener it will create a onclick method for you automatically and in here you just need to call Finish okay Finish method just uh closes your app gracefully so if the user wants to close the app he can click this yes yes button and it will close your app gracefully otherwise just go uh outside this set positive button and just go below that and Dot set negative button and we can set negative condition also and the first argument of this is the text on this button second argument is the onclick method so new onclick listener and in here also we can uh call a method to cancel this dialogue box so in here you can see this dialogue variable inside this onclick U uh method so just call this dialog do cancel and this will close your alert right and now outside this uh negative button I will just give this semicolon here so that that we can close this method so what we have uh done basically here is we have uh created a method and inside this method we have created a button variable and we have casted it and we have taken the ID of this button and then we call uh on this button set on this onclick listener new onclick listener and inside this on click of this main button we have uh created our builder for the alert uh dialogue right and on this alert Builder variable here we have called set message so this is the message it's going to uh display the second method we have called is set cancellable so it's uh not going to show any cancel button so we have set it to false then we have called set positive so this is the positive button it's going to show this alert dialogue and the text it's going to show is yes and on click uh event of this uh button we are just closing our app gracefully otherwise we have set the negative button for the negative condition and we will uh just close this app uh close this alert dialogue Box by calling this button uh this method called dialog. cancel okay and I think uh in here where I have defined alert dialog. Builder aore Builder is equal to new alert dialogue in here I must uh remove this uh brackets from here and instead of this we can just call we can just call the name of our activity class which is Main activity and then we can call this on Main activity so in here after Builder just before this this you just need to write main activity do this okay so now we have created our Builder right just below this uh Builder method or build a code just below this we are going to create our alert dialog now so alert dialogue and we will name it as alert is equal to and now we will uh take our builder for the alert dialogue and we will create a new alert so alert Builder do create right after this this from this alert dialogue instance you can can set the title on this uh alert box for example alert and then you can call show method to show this alert dialog box so alert dot show okay so now your code is complete so we can uh call this method inside our on create method so this is was our method uh so just copy this method and inside your on create method you can call this method so just paste this method inside your on create method now I'm going to run my application so my application is running now and this is my alert button so when I click this alert button here a new alert dialogue box appears right the title of this alert is alert which we have set and uh this is the message which we have set do you want to close this app right and there are two buttons no and yes for example we click no button nothing happens just uh uh this alert dialog box uh closes right now once again I'm going to open this alert dialogue and this time I will click this yes and when I click yes it gracefully uh closes my app right once again I will uh start my app open it no nothing happens it just closes the alert dialogue and yes it closes my app so in this way you can use alert dialogue in your Android activity I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
