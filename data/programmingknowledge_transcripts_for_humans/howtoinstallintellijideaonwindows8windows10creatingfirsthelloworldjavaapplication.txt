09:21 - folder right now there is no file inside
09:25 - this Source folder but we can uh you
09:27 - know create one file in inside the

09:32 - file so right click on it and then we
09:35 - are going to create a new Java class
09:37 - here and we will name our uh Java class
09:41 - as for example app and then click okay
09:45 - so this is going to create a new Java
09:49 - class for you which is app now you can
09:52 - see the font here looks a little bit
