00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:02 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - video so in this video we're going to
00:06 - continue working on with our initialized
00:09 - at page P file so this is actually the
00:13 - part three of our PHP rest tutorial in
00:16 - API or I mean in PHP so now let's just
00:21 - continue working on with this initialize
00:24 - that PHP file so we have defined our
00:28 - site rule and then we supplied the
00:35 - directory that our directory of our
00:41 - project so now let's just define the
00:46 - include path or our files
00:50 - so that's defined and then I
00:55 - nc then path so it will just load all
01:02 - the necessary files in our include
01:06 - folders okay so ing path and then we
01:13 - need to bring in the site root okay and
01:17 - then the directory separator
01:19 - and of course the folder includes okay
01:28 - so basically we're just saying here that
01:31 - we want to go or we want to define the
01:34 - include path as the site root which is
01:39 - 164 and then triple W and then PHP rest
01:46 - and of course the includes directory
01:51 - which is we have created the config dot
01:54 - PHP file okay and of course we also need
01:59 - to do the same with our core directory
02:02 - okay so basically we're just defining
02:07 - here different directories in our
02:11 - project so it will make
02:13 - more sense later on when we try to
02:15 - include all this files or all the files
02:18 - and under this directories so called
02:23 - path and and it should be instead of
02:28 - using include it should be core okay so
02:35 - since we have this lines already we can
02:38 - just load the config file first so to do
02:46 - that we need to require once ok by using
02:54 - the constant ing path that we have
02:59 - defined above and then the directory
03:03 - separator and then the file or the
03:09 - actual file for our config which is
03:12 - config data HP ok and of course we can
03:17 - also include the core classes here
03:26 - so let us say required ones and then the
03:34 - core class which is our constant and
03:39 - then directory separator and of course
03:42 - say for example we have session or any
03:50 - other classes from our core directory so
03:53 - so for example we will create another
03:54 - one here say post post that PHP ok so in
04:04 - our initialize that paid page we will
04:06 - just say or path and then directories
04:11 - operate or and of course the post at PHP
04:15 - a so after that we need to go to our
04:21 - post add page B file and configure the
04:24 - actual content
04:27 - of our post so basically we're just
04:31 - going to create a class here so the HP
04:34 - and class post and in here we need to
04:42 - add the database stuff here so that will
04:48 - be private and then the connection and
04:52 - we also have private and table which
04:57 - will be post okay and then of course we
05:01 - need to add also the post properties so
05:07 - that will be public I mean public
05:11 - category ID public vagary name public
05:25 - title of our post and body of a post and
05:34 - the author or authors were post and also
05:40 - the date that the post has been created
05:44 - so there you go and of course we need to
05:48 - initialize this class or particular
05:50 - class by using the construct or with the
05:58 - DB connection okay so that will be
06:03 - public function and then construct and
06:09 - of course we need to supply the database
06:12 - connection here and we need to set the
06:15 - connection or the attribute of this
06:19 - particular class connection to the
06:22 - database connection that we have
06:24 - supplied in our construct method or
06:28 - function okay so here we go and below
06:34 - this construct a construct method we
06:36 - need to have the function to actually
06:40 - read the record from our database so
06:44 - public function and read okay so this is
06:49 - for getting the posts from our database
06:56 - and in here we need to create the actual
07:00 - query of our read function so that will
07:04 - be a query and then the Select statement
07:10 - okay
07:11 - so we're just going to have this
07:15 - formatted so it is easy to read so
07:22 - select and then see that name as
07:29 - category name and P that I did this is
07:36 - for between category name or the
07:39 - category and of course the post so we
07:44 - that category ID the gray ID here and
07:51 - post title post body and of course the
08:00 - post also or author of our post and date
08:07 - okay and in here we need to specify the
08:14 - table which are what table yeah this
08:26 - table which has we have initialized it
08:34 - into post and then the name which is P
08:42 - or the alias of our table is e and then
08:49 - left join
08:56 - categories so this will involve two
08:59 - tables the post and categories so alias
09:05 - of categories C and on e that category
09:13 - ID equals C that ID and then we need to
09:20 - have this ordered by ordered by P
09:30 - decorated rated at it should be created
09:35 - ad descending to actually get the the
09:46 - latest post and we need to close this
09:54 - here okay
09:57 - and in here we need to prepare the
10:03 - statement we prepared a statement or
10:08 - prepare statement okay
10:12 - and that's stmd and then using the
10:17 - connection that we have
10:19 - and of course prepare method and the app
10:25 - shell query of our post and execute
10:31 - theory by calling STM T and then using
10:36 - the execute function okay
10:41 - and then we're just going to return the
10:46 - STM T for an hour
10:48 - or the statement okay so save this and
10:51 - then we also need to add another file or
10:59 - another directory year so no not there
11:05 - order directory for our API so in our
11:10 - API we need to have the read that page P
11:15 - file okay and then in the next video
11:21 - we're going to work with the read that
11:23 - PHP file and continue working on with
11:26 - our project so I know this won't make
11:28 - sense for now but bear with bear with me
11:30 - we will just create all the necessary
11:33 - functions are all the necessary features
11:36 - for us to create the page B REST API in
11:40 - PHP so thank you for watching and see
11:43 - you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so in this video we're going to continue working on with our initialized at page P file so this is actually the part three of our PHP rest tutorial in API or I mean in PHP so now let's just continue working on with this initialize that PHP file so we have defined our site rule and then we supplied the directory that our directory of our project so now let's just define the include path or our files so that's defined and then I nc then path so it will just load all the necessary files in our include folders okay so ing path and then we need to bring in the site root okay and then the directory separator and of course the folder includes okay so basically we're just saying here that we want to go or we want to define the include path as the site root which is 164 and then triple W and then PHP rest and of course the includes directory which is we have created the config dot PHP file okay and of course we also need to do the same with our core directory okay so basically we're just defining here different directories in our project so it will make more sense later on when we try to include all this files or all the files and under this directories so called path and and it should be instead of using include it should be core okay so since we have this lines already we can just load the config file first so to do that we need to require once ok by using the constant ing path that we have defined above and then the directory separator and then the file or the actual file for our config which is config data HP ok and of course we can also include the core classes here so let us say required ones and then the core class which is our constant and then directory separator and of course say for example we have session or any other classes from our core directory so so for example we will create another one here say post post that PHP ok so in our initialize that paid page we will just say or path and then directories operate or and of course the post at PHP a so after that we need to go to our post add page B file and configure the actual content of our post so basically we're just going to create a class here so the HP and class post and in here we need to add the database stuff here so that will be private and then the connection and we also have private and table which will be post okay and then of course we need to add also the post properties so that will be public I mean public category ID public vagary name public title of our post and body of a post and the author or authors were post and also the date that the post has been created so there you go and of course we need to initialize this class or particular class by using the construct or with the DB connection okay so that will be public function and then construct and of course we need to supply the database connection here and we need to set the connection or the attribute of this particular class connection to the database connection that we have supplied in our construct method or function okay so here we go and below this construct a construct method we need to have the function to actually read the record from our database so public function and read okay so this is for getting the posts from our database and in here we need to create the actual query of our read function so that will be a query and then the Select statement okay so we're just going to have this formatted so it is easy to read so select and then see that name as category name and P that I did this is for between category name or the category and of course the post so we that category ID the gray ID here and post title post body and of course the post also or author of our post and date okay and in here we need to specify the table which are what table yeah this table which has we have initialized it into post and then the name which is P or the alias of our table is e and then left join categories so this will involve two tables the post and categories so alias of categories C and on e that category ID equals C that ID and then we need to have this ordered by ordered by P decorated rated at it should be created ad descending to actually get the the latest post and we need to close this here okay and in here we need to prepare the statement we prepared a statement or prepare statement okay and that's stmd and then using the connection that we have and of course prepare method and the app shell query of our post and execute theory by calling STM T and then using the execute function okay and then we're just going to return the STM T for an hour or the statement okay so save this and then we also need to add another file or another directory year so no not there order directory for our API so in our API we need to have the read that page P file okay and then in the next video we're going to work with the read that PHP file and continue working on with our project so I know this won't make sense for now but bear with bear with me we will just create all the necessary functions are all the necessary features for us to create the page B REST API in PHP so thank you for watching and see you in the next video
