00:11 - know what is VirtualBox virtual box is
00:14 - an application using which you can run
00:17 - different operating system virtually on
00:21 - your host operating system so for
00:24 - example I am running Windows as my host
00:27 - operating system and I have VirtualBox
00:30 - on my Windows operating system and I
00:33 - want to run Ubuntu 18.4 on that Windows
00:39 - operating system using VirtualBox the
00:42 - VirtualBox will enable me to do this so
00:45 - let's see how we can do it so if you
00:48 - don't know how to install VirtualBox you
00:51 - can go to this website which is
00:53 - VirtualBox dot o-r-g and then you can go
00:56 - to the download section or you can just
01:00 - click this button which says download
01:02 - VirtualBox and then you just need to
01:05 - click on this which says windows host or
01:07 - if you are on Mac then you can choose
01:09 - the OS X host or if you are on Linux
01:13 - then you can choose the Linux version so
01:15 - just click on that and then just follow
01:17 - the installation steps which are pretty
01:20 - easy to follow and you just need to
01:23 - click some next buttons and VirtualBox
01:25 - will be installed on your windows
01:27 - operating system now the next thing we
01:29 - need to have in order to install Ubuntu
01:32 - 18.04 on our Virtual Box is the ISO file
01:37 - of Ubuntu so just visit on this website
01:42 - which is ubuntu.com and you can see
01:45 - Ubuntu 18.4 LTS is out now so you can
01:51 - just click on this button which says
01:53 - download 18.4 now or you can go to the
01:58 - download section and then choose the
02:00 - desktop option and then also you will be
02:03 - able to see Ubuntu 18.4 so what I'm
02:07 - going to do is I'm going to click on
02:09 - downloads and here I'm going to click on
02:13 - Ubuntu desktop and here we can see
02:15 - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS world so now I will
02:19 - directly click on the download button
02:21 - and here you will be encouraged to
02:24 - donate to open to website but I don't
02:26 - want to do it for now so I'm going to
02:29 - just move everything to $0
02:32 - and you can see and now the cost is $0
02:35 - and then I can click on this button
02:37 - which says not now take me to the
02:39 - download and now you can see the
02:41 - download of the Ubuntu 18.4 desktop AMD
02:46 - 64 dot iOS so file will start now it's
02:50 - around 1 point 8 gigabyte file so it
02:53 - will take some time to download so you
02:56 - can just click on OK and download this
02:58 - file I have already downloaded it for
03:00 - this file so I'm going to click cancel
03:02 - but in your case you need to download
03:04 - this file and after downloading this
03:06 - file is going to look like this so I'm
03:09 - going to minimize everything and you can
03:11 - see it will look like this with an
03:13 - extension is so now if you have
03:15 - downloaded this file you can directly
03:17 - move to the Virtual Box manager so when
03:22 - you open VirtualBox it's going to look
03:23 - like this and in here we are going to
03:25 - create a new virtual machine so just
03:28 - click on new here on the top and just
03:31 - write the name of your machine so we are
03:34 - installing ubuntu so I'm going to just
03:37 - type ubuntu here and I'm going to also
03:40 - going to just say open to 18.4 here
03:43 - whatever name you want to give you can
03:45 - give it from here
03:47 - the type is Linux obviously and the
03:49 - version is Ubuntu 64-bit so you can see
03:53 - there are lots and lots of different
03:55 - operating system and their versions are
03:58 - there we just need to choose open to
04:00 - 64-bit and then we can just click Next
04:04 - here these are the memory size
04:07 - requirement so if you don't have any
04:10 - problem I will extend it to around the
04:15 - green line here so up to the green line
04:18 - whatever it requires and I'm going to
04:20 - click Next so now in this next section
04:23 - you will be asked to provide the hard
04:26 - disk
04:26 - and if you don't have the good reason to
04:29 - change it I will leave it as default
04:31 - which is create a virtual hard disk now
04:33 - so I'm going to just click create and in
04:37 - here you will see a few options for hard
04:39 - disk file type I'm going to leave it as
04:42 - default also which is VirtualBox disk
04:44 - image and I'm going to click Next and in
04:48 - the next window you will be asked to
04:49 - provide storage on physical hard disks
04:52 - so we are going to choose this option
04:53 - which says dynamically allocated if you
04:56 - want to see the details of what is the
04:59 - difference between dynamically or
05:00 - allocated memory and the fixed size you
05:03 - can read here but the better is this
05:07 - option which says dynamically allocated
05:09 - and I always use it and I'm going to
05:12 - click Next and on this next window you
05:14 - will see the file location and the size
05:18 - so if you don't have the good reason to
05:20 - change it I will leave it as default the
05:23 - location and for the size I can increase
05:26 - it up to according to my system
05:29 - requirement so for example I want around
05:32 - 60 gigabyte of memory so I'm going to
05:35 - just move it to 60 around 60 but it's
05:39 - totally dependent on you so whatever
05:41 - amount of size you want to have you can
05:44 - just increase this size and now I'm
05:47 - going to just click on create' which is
05:50 - going to create this virtual machine
05:52 - here but don't start this machine yet we
05:55 - need to do some settings here also so
05:58 - just choose this virtual machine which
06:00 - is Ubuntu 18.04 and I'm going to click
06:03 - on settings here which is going to open
06:06 - the settings for this virtual machine so
06:08 - on the top you will see general settings
06:11 - here in the Advanced tab you can just
06:15 - choose this option which says a
06:17 - bidirectional
06:18 - for shared clipboard and drag-drop also
06:22 - bidirectional this will enable you to
06:24 - copy from your host machine to your
06:27 - virtual machine which is Ubuntu now the
06:30 - next section is the system so I'm going
06:32 - to choose a system here and here you can
06:35 - change the base memory of your open to
06:38 - operating system so for now I
06:41 - leave it as default but in the future if
06:43 - you want to change it you can change it
06:45 - from here the next step is for processor
06:47 - so by default VirtualBox will allocate
06:50 - one CPU to your virtual machine but you
06:53 - can increase it from here so for now I
06:56 - will increase it to 4 CPUs and then I
06:59 - can go to display here here you can do
07:02 - the display settings for now I don't
07:03 - want to change it I will directly go to
07:06 - the storage section and this is the
07:09 - important section so in the storage you
07:11 - just need to choose this option which
07:13 - says empty so under the controller you
07:16 - will see this empty disk option here so
07:19 - choose this option and then you just
07:22 - need to click on the CD icon so just
07:25 - choose the CD icon and then click on
07:29 - choose virtual optical disk file and in
07:32 - here you just need to give the path of
07:33 - your ISO file so I'm going to copy the
07:36 - path and paste it here and then I will
07:39 - choose the ISO file which I have
07:41 - downloaded ok so this is the file I have
07:44 - downloaded from the window website so
07:46 - I'm going to just choose it and then
07:48 - click OK
07:49 - so once you are finished with the
07:51 - settings now we are ready to run our
07:54 - virtual machine so just choose your
07:56 - virtual machine and click on the start
07:58 - button which is going to start the
07:59 - installation of your Ubuntu and now you
08:02 - can see the installation for Ubuntu
08:04 - 18.04 has been started now in the first
08:07 - step you will choose the language in
08:09 - which you want to install ubuntu so I
08:11 - want to install Ubuntu in English so I
08:14 - will choose this option which says
08:15 - English and then you can just click on
08:18 - install Ubuntu button here so I'm going
08:21 - to just click install Ubuntu now in the
08:23 - next step you will be asked to provide
08:25 - the keyboard layout for your Ubuntu
08:28 - operating system so each country have
08:31 - their different keyboard layout so I am
08:34 - going to choose the German keyboard
08:36 - layout because I want the German
08:38 - keyboard layout so I will just scroll
08:41 - down a little and then I will choose
08:43 - German here and also for German there
08:47 - are different kind of keyboard layout so
08:49 - I will do
08:50 - the default keyboard layout which is
08:53 - German so whatever country you are
08:54 - living in you can choose the keyboard
08:56 - layout of that country and then click
08:59 - continue now in the next step it asks me
09:02 - what apps would you like to install to
09:05 - start with so I will just choose the
09:07 - normal installation and I will just
09:10 - choose download updates while installing
09:12 - Ubuntu and I will also choose this
09:14 - option which says install third-party

09:34 - a option which you just need to leave
09:37 - default and then click on Install Now
09:39 - and now it will give you this kind of
09:42 - question write the changes to this so I

09:48 - it as default and I'm going to just
09:50 - click continue and in here you can
09:52 - provide the credentials whatever
09:53 - credentials you want to provide to your
09:55 - open to operating system so for example
09:58 - I want to give the name code bind here
10:01 - and then the computer's name will be
10:05 - code binding - VirtualBox so I can even
10:08 - change this also I don't want our
10:10 - children tore code bind so I can remove
10:13 - it and this is the pick a user name so
10:16 - this will be the user name of your
10:17 - window operating system and then you can
10:20 - provide the password which you will use
10:22 - to login to your ribbon to operating
10:25 - system so for now I will provide a
10:27 - really weak password but you are free to
10:30 - choose the strong password and then
10:32 - confirm your password and then click
10:34 - continue so now you can see the
10:36 - installation of Ubuntu operating system
10:37 - has been started so in this step you
10:40 - just need to wait for the installation
10:41 - to complete so I will just pause the
10:43 - video until the installation is complete
10:47 - and now you can see this message which
10:50 - says installation is complete you need

11:11 - installation medium then reboot so I'm
11:13 - going to just close this window from
11:16 - here and restart my ubuntu from my
11:19 - VirtualBox so I am going to just say
11:21 - power of the machine which is going to
11:25 - close this window and now I'm going to
11:28 - choose Ubuntu 18.4 once again and I'm
11:31 - going to start it from this button and
11:33 - you can see it's starting my virtual
11:36 - machine and now I can see that Ubuntu
11:39 - 18.4 has been restarted and this is the
11:42 - username which I have given so I'm going
11:45 - to click on the username and now I will
11:48 - give the password which I have given in
