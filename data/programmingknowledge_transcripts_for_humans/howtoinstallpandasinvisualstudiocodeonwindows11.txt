00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install and use pandas
00:06 - with your Visual Studio code editor on
00:08 - your Windows operating system so let's
00:10 - get started so first of all open your
00:13 - Visual Studio code editor and then we
00:15 - are going to create a project you can
00:17 - create a project folder anywhere on your
00:20 - Windows operating system I'm going to
00:22 - use my documents folder to create this
00:25 - project and inside my documents folder
00:28 - I'm going to create a folder called
00:31 - Panda's app
00:34 - and I'm going to open this pandas app in
00:38 - Visual Studio code by clicking on open
00:40 - folder
00:42 - and then I'm going to select this pandas
00:44 - app folder and then click on ADD which
00:47 - is going to add this pandas folder in my
00:50 - workspace right now here I can create a
00:54 - new python file to test my pandas code
00:59 - so I'm going to name my file as test Dot
01:03 - py
01:04 - and here I'm going to write a very
01:06 - simple pandas code to test it right
01:11 - so you can see for now it says import
01:14 - pandas could not be resolved and let's
01:17 - see how we can install pandas so that we
01:20 - can run our pandas project
01:23 - so to uh to that just click on Terminal
01:27 - and open a new terminal
01:29 - and from here you can select which kind
01:32 - of terminal you want to open let's say I
01:35 - want to open command prompt terminal I
01:37 - don't want to use Powershell for now and
01:40 - you can see
01:42 - CMD here right that means command prompt
01:45 - is open
01:46 - now we are going to create a virtual
01:49 - environment for our project virtual
01:52 - environment helps us to install pip
01:56 - packages locally
01:58 - so for example if you just want to
02:00 - install pandas just for this project
02:04 - virtual environment will help you to do
02:06 - that
02:07 - to create a virtual environment you give
02:10 - this command just write python hyphen M
02:15 - VM and then the name of your virtual
02:18 - environment I'm going to name my virtual
02:21 - environment as my n you can rename this
02:26 - environment anything so if you want to
02:30 - name it as python project or anything
02:32 - you can do that let me press enter here
02:36 - as soon as I press enter you will be
02:39 - able to see that there is this my end
02:42 - folder which is created here
02:45 - this means that virtual environment with
02:48 - the name my end has been created for my
02:53 - project inside my project directory
02:57 - now in order to activate the
03:01 - virtual n you will be able to see this
03:03 - activate file inside the scripts file
03:07 - under your virtual and folder
03:10 - so you just need to activate it so just
03:15 - type the name of your virtual
03:16 - environment
03:17 - then just write forward slash and then
03:20 - write script and then once again forward
03:24 - slash and then type activate and then
03:28 - press enter
03:29 - and this is going to activate your
03:31 - virtual environment now in order to
03:33 - verify that virtual environment has been
03:37 - activated or not you can see once the
03:40 - virtual environment is activated in
03:42 - front of your path you will see the name
03:46 - of your virtual environment after you
03:49 - activate it before the activation you
03:51 - don't see the name of the virtual
03:53 - environment before this path right now
03:56 - as soon as I activated it I can see this
03:59 - virtual environment
04:01 - in front of my path right
04:04 - that means this virtual environment has
04:07 - been activated
04:09 - now in order to install the pandas
04:12 - package just type pip
04:15 - install and then pandas or any other pip
04:20 - package you want to install in your
04:24 - project you just need to write pip
04:26 - install and the name of that project so
04:29 - my
04:30 - package name is Panda so I'm going to
04:33 - just write pip install pandas and then
04:35 - press enter which is going to start the
04:37 - process of installing this pandas
04:40 - package locally in my project so just
04:45 - wait for this process to complete and
04:47 - once the package is installed you will
04:51 - be able to see the command successfully
04:54 - install these packages
04:57 - now because pandas have other
04:59 - dependencies like numpy and other
05:03 - packages that's why additional packages
05:06 - will be installed in addition to pandas
05:09 - but the important thing is pandas is
05:12 - already installed right
05:15 - once your package is installed you can
05:18 - run your python script
05:20 - so I have already written some test code
05:24 - to test my pandas code so the only thing
05:28 - which remains is to run it so I'm going
05:30 - to just type Python and the name of my
05:33 - file which is test Dot py and you can
05:37 - see that my python code is running
05:41 - successfully right
05:43 - so you can see uh the response has been
05:46 - printed here that means everything is
05:49 - working fine uh in my code and from now
05:53 - on I can start using pandas in my python
05:57 - project
05:58 - so this is how you can install and use
06:00 - pandas in your Visual Studio code on
06:04 - your Windows operating system I hope
06:06 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
06:08 - you in the next video
