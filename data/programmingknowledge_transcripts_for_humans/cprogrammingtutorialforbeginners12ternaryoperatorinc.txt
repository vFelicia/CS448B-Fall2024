00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video this is John from programming
00:07 - knowledge and in this video guys we're
00:09 - going to learn how to use ternary
00:12 - operators in C so basically against the
00:16 - ternary operator is used to execute code
00:19 - based on the result of a binary
00:23 - condition so when we say ternary
00:26 - operators it is used to execute code
00:30 - based on binary condition okay and it
00:36 - takes in a binary condition as input and
00:39 - which makes it similar to an else
00:42 - control flow block
00:44 - so for example guys from our previous
00:48 - tutorial we have discussed how to use if
00:52 - else statement okay so we have this kind
00:58 - of structure so for example we want to
01:00 - use this structure or code to get the
01:05 - maximum two values or two variables so
01:12 - if you want to like return the max value
01:16 - all you have to do is compare the two
01:20 - variables a and B so for example if a is
01:25 - greater than B then of course a or max
01:30 - will be assigned to a otherwise the max
01:36 - number will be the value of variable B
01:41 - okay so the ternary operator guys
01:45 - instead of using if-else like this this
01:49 - is too long for a simple you know
01:53 - checking of value condition so the
01:57 - binary or ternary operator uses only
02:01 - single line or we can use the ternary
02:03 - operators in a single line and it
02:07 - returns a value so behaving similar to a
02:10 - function okay so let's try
02:13 - to see the syntax of the ternary
02:17 - operators in C so basically the syntax
02:20 - is like this result and then binary
02:25 - condition and then you have to add the
02:28 - question mark and then you have like the
02:32 - value when the binary condition is true
02:37 - otherwise the value of you know value to
02:43 - be returned if the binary condition is
02:46 - false so we have to take note guys that
02:50 - the ternary cannot be used to execute
02:53 - code so it must be either returned in
02:57 - the function or set equal to a variable
03:02 - so you cannot use this something like
03:05 - this so you cannot leave your ternary
03:08 - operator like this so it should be equal
03:12 - to or be set equal to e variable okay
03:15 - something like this or you can use it as
03:18 - a return in the particular function okay
03:22 - so let's try to implement a ternary
03:27 - operator so for example you want to
03:31 - check the max value so the long version
03:34 - is this if a is greater than B then
03:38 - assign the value of A to D max and then
03:43 - otherwise assign the value of B to the
03:46 - Max variable so as I've said we can you
03:51 - know make this a little shorter by using
03:54 - the ternary operators so in order for us
03:57 - to do that we just need to suffer
04:01 - example get the variable Max and then
04:04 - the binary condition s a is a greater
04:09 - than B a so we can add the question mark
04:15 - there you go question mark and then the
04:19 - value to be returned if the binary
04:23 - condition is true so
04:26 - of course if a is greater than B then
04:28 - the max value is a right otherwise the
04:36 - value is B or the return or the max
04:40 - value is the value of variable B as I
04:46 - said guys this is the explanation of
04:52 - conditional or ternary operators in C so
04:57 - we have this variable and then we have
05:00 - the expression or the condition and then
05:04 - you have to add the question mark and
05:06 - then the value if true so it will return
05:10 - the resultant value into the variable
05:13 - and it will assign this value to this
05:16 - variable otherwise if the expression is
05:20 - false then the resultant value of you
05:25 - know the false then it will be returned
05:27 - as the value of the variable that we
05:30 - have added okay so we can check this
05:33 - right now we can remove this this is the
05:36 - long version and we can try to print
05:42 - this display the result the max value
05:48 - yes and then format specifier which is
05:53 - producing int so percent B and then of
05:56 - course the Maps variable okay let's just
06:04 - remove this so clean and build or build
06:11 - and run our application so let's try
06:16 - this oh we don't have like the value for
06:26 - a and B so let's try to assign values to
06:30 - this variable so for example a equals 15
06:35 - and B was 16
06:39 - okay so clean and build our application
06:44 - and we'll try to get the output so the
06:53 - max value is 16 okay so we have here the
07:01 - B variable 16 so that's the value of Max
07:07 - variable that is being assigned because
07:10 - this particular condition returns false
07:15 - so that's why the value of B variable is
07:19 - being assigned to the max variable so we
07:22 - can also try this with the other you
07:27 - know if the a is greater than B so like
07:31 - 20 so obviously a is greater than B so
07:37 - let's try this accept this for now and
07:41 - then build and run our application so
07:47 - let's try this so there you go the max
07:52 - value is 20 so this condition returns
07:59 - true because a which is the value is 20
08:04 - and that's greater than B because b is
08:09 - the value a 16 so it returns the value
08:13 - of a so like this so it ignores the
08:18 - second part which is the B because it
08:22 - returns true and then of course after
08:26 - after evaluation the value of B is being
08:30 - assigned to the max variable that we
08:33 - have here so it printed out that the max
08:36 - value s percent D and then which is 20
08:41 - so let's try let's try this one more
08:43 - time
08:47 - just so you can see the output so the
08:49 - max value is 20 hey so this is quite
08:54 - useful if we only want to check a
08:59 - certain value so like if you're planning
09:02 - to use if-else then you might want to
09:06 - use the ternary operators which is like
09:09 - this so it will just save you time it
09:14 - will save you of code space and I think
09:19 - it's clear rather than using the F and
09:24 - Alice statement so this is pretty
09:27 - straight forward
09:28 - when it comes to checking the value and
09:30 - assigning the value to the max worry
09:34 - about okay so you just have to remember
09:36 - that it cannot be used to execute code
09:39 - you just have to set this equal to a
09:43 - variable or you can use this as return
09:46 - value of a function okay
09:50 - so I hope that's clear and I think
09:52 - that's all there is to it for this
09:54 - tutorial guys and if you have questions
09:56 - please let us know in the comment
09:58 - section below thank you for watching and
10:00 - see in the next video

hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're going to learn how to use ternary operators in C so basically against the ternary operator is used to execute code based on the result of a binary condition so when we say ternary operators it is used to execute code based on binary condition okay and it takes in a binary condition as input and which makes it similar to an else control flow block so for example guys from our previous tutorial we have discussed how to use if else statement okay so we have this kind of structure so for example we want to use this structure or code to get the maximum two values or two variables so if you want to like return the max value all you have to do is compare the two variables a and B so for example if a is greater than B then of course a or max will be assigned to a otherwise the max number will be the value of variable B okay so the ternary operator guys instead of using ifelse like this this is too long for a simple you know checking of value condition so the binary or ternary operator uses only single line or we can use the ternary operators in a single line and it returns a value so behaving similar to a function okay so let's try to see the syntax of the ternary operators in C so basically the syntax is like this result and then binary condition and then you have to add the question mark and then you have like the value when the binary condition is true otherwise the value of you know value to be returned if the binary condition is false so we have to take note guys that the ternary cannot be used to execute code so it must be either returned in the function or set equal to a variable so you cannot use this something like this so you cannot leave your ternary operator like this so it should be equal to or be set equal to e variable okay something like this or you can use it as a return in the particular function okay so let's try to implement a ternary operator so for example you want to check the max value so the long version is this if a is greater than B then assign the value of A to D max and then otherwise assign the value of B to the Max variable so as I've said we can you know make this a little shorter by using the ternary operators so in order for us to do that we just need to suffer example get the variable Max and then the binary condition s a is a greater than B a so we can add the question mark there you go question mark and then the value to be returned if the binary condition is true so of course if a is greater than B then the max value is a right otherwise the value is B or the return or the max value is the value of variable B as I said guys this is the explanation of conditional or ternary operators in C so we have this variable and then we have the expression or the condition and then you have to add the question mark and then the value if true so it will return the resultant value into the variable and it will assign this value to this variable otherwise if the expression is false then the resultant value of you know the false then it will be returned as the value of the variable that we have added okay so we can check this right now we can remove this this is the long version and we can try to print this display the result the max value yes and then format specifier which is producing int so percent B and then of course the Maps variable okay let's just remove this so clean and build or build and run our application so let's try this oh we don't have like the value for a and B so let's try to assign values to this variable so for example a equals 15 and B was 16 okay so clean and build our application and we'll try to get the output so the max value is 16 okay so we have here the B variable 16 so that's the value of Max variable that is being assigned because this particular condition returns false so that's why the value of B variable is being assigned to the max variable so we can also try this with the other you know if the a is greater than B so like 20 so obviously a is greater than B so let's try this accept this for now and then build and run our application so let's try this so there you go the max value is 20 so this condition returns true because a which is the value is 20 and that's greater than B because b is the value a 16 so it returns the value of a so like this so it ignores the second part which is the B because it returns true and then of course after after evaluation the value of B is being assigned to the max variable that we have here so it printed out that the max value s percent D and then which is 20 so let's try let's try this one more time just so you can see the output so the max value is 20 hey so this is quite useful if we only want to check a certain value so like if you're planning to use ifelse then you might want to use the ternary operators which is like this so it will just save you time it will save you of code space and I think it's clear rather than using the F and Alice statement so this is pretty straight forward when it comes to checking the value and assigning the value to the max worry about okay so you just have to remember that it cannot be used to execute code you just have to set this equal to a variable or you can use this as return value of a function okay so I hope that's clear and I think that's all there is to it for this tutorial guys and if you have questions please let us know in the comment section below thank you for watching and
