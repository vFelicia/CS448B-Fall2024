00:00 - hello guys welcome to the fifth video
00:02 - tutorial on PHP programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we are going
00:07 - to see how to use and declare variables
00:11 - in
00:12 - PHP so till now in the last video I've
00:16 - shown you how to write your hello world
00:18 - first program and how to provide comment
00:21 - to your program right and by the way
00:25 - make sure that your Apache server is
00:27 - running using your control panel Sam
00:30 - control panel and you are able to see
00:34 - this Parent Directory in my case this
00:37 - was YouTube which I have made in my HD
00:40 - doc folder right and in the last video I
00:43 - have made one PHP file to test my Hello
00:47 - World program okay now in this video I'm
00:50 - going to make a new file so I will just
00:53 - click new I will save it as
00:58 - variable
01:00 - variable. PHP
01:03 - okay and once again when I refresh my
01:07 - program I will be able to see this
01:09 - variable. PHP but right now it's blank
01:13 - okay so first of all I will just write
01:18 - my
01:25 - skeleton and it will end like this
01:30 - right and let's see how variable Works
01:34 - in PHP okay so in PHP variable or PHP
01:41 - variables must begin with end sign okay
01:46 - so if you are used to uh uh some other
01:50 - variable declaration if you have learned
01:52 - C or C++ or Java and or any other um
01:56 - programming language you're used to uh
01:59 - using
02:00 - data type of the variable first and then
02:03 - the name and then you can assign the
02:06 - value to it but in PHP all variabl start
02:11 - with this end symbol and they don't
02:14 - start with any data type PHP interprets
02:18 - their value by the initialization they
02:21 - get okay and so let's see how we can
02:27 - declare a variable first of all what is
02:30 - a variable a variable
02:33 - is a container for some value okay so
02:37 - value variable is something that stores
02:40 - your value okay so in PHP we just need
02:44 - to Define this end and then the name of
02:47 - your variable so for example I can name
02:50 - my variable
02:52 - as
02:54 - um value for
02:57 - example and I can initialize this value
03:01 - by a number or a string so I will
03:04 - initialize this value by a number for
03:07 - example and by this
03:10 - initialization your variable knows or
03:13 - PHP knows that this variable which is
03:16 - value is of type
03:19 - integer right in the same way for
03:23 - example I can uh declare
03:27 - a um name for example this is the name
03:31 - of my variable and I can initialize this
03:37 - by a string so I can just
03:42 - write
03:48 - programming programming knowledge okay
03:51 - so by this
03:52 - initialization PHP knows that name is a
03:56 - string uh variable and by this initial
03:59 - initialization PHP knows that our value
04:02 - is a integer initialization or integer
04:06 - value right
04:08 - so unlike other languages PHP doesn't
04:12 - provide any data type right it only
04:16 - start with uh this end symbol
04:20 - and it is decided by the initialization
04:23 - of the variable what type it is okay now
04:29 - PHP variables are case sensitive so you
04:33 - can see that this variable with a
04:36 - capital b o is not equal
04:39 - to this this one I just need to change
04:43 - this this should be small B okay so let
04:47 - me change this so This boo which starts
04:52 - with with capital B is not equal to this
04:55 - boo which which start with with uh small
04:59 - B
05:00 - and this is even not equal to this boo
05:03 - so PHP variables are case sensitive okay
05:07 - now global and locally scoped variable
05:11 - Global variable can you can use it
05:14 - anywhere in the program and the local
05:16 - variable we can use inside a function or
05:20 - a class that we will see later okay and
05:24 - some of the variable names are reserved
05:27 - in PHP like
05:30 - post underscore Post in capital letters
05:34 - underscore get in capital letters these
05:36 - are form variables and in a similar way
05:39 - some server variables are reserved so
05:42 - you cannot declare a variable which is
05:46 - same as this server right in
05:50 - capital so some of the variables are
05:52 - reserved in PHP right
05:57 - now we move for further let's see the
06:01 - usage of of uh this variable so I have
06:06 - already shown you whatever you provide
06:09 - the value of variable it's called that
06:15 - variable so if you initialize uh a
06:18 - variable with a numerical value it will
06:21 - be called a numerical variable and if
06:25 - you initialize
06:27 - your variable by a string value
06:30 - it will be called string variable okay
06:33 - and these variables you can uh perform
06:37 - some multiplication or arithmetic
06:40 - operations but on string values you
06:43 - cannot do the these values because
06:45 - string you cannot uh multiply or divide
06:49 - or add add them together right so let's
06:53 - see this this also so for example I want
06:57 - to multiply this by
07:01 - by some values so I can write
07:06 - and and then the value is equal
07:10 - to and so whenever you use this value
07:15 - you need to initialize this by end so
07:18 - you know that this is a value right so
07:21 - you can do it like this you don't need
07:25 - to provide any space in in between and
07:30 - you can multiply this value by for
07:35 - example eight like this okay it will be
07:39 - completely valid but so let's try and
07:42 - run the program I will save it
07:46 - and I'll just refresh this and right now
07:51 - there is nothing printed and no error is
07:54 - coming that's uh that means our variable
07:57 - is uh I mean not giving any any error
08:00 - right no result because we are not
08:02 - printing anything right now that's why
08:04 - we are not seeing any result but it's
08:06 - not giving any error right but on the
08:10 - same on the other hand for example I
08:14 - want to multiply this name variable
08:17 - which is a string variable by the
08:21 - initialization so I can do something
08:24 - like
08:25 - this and I want to multiply by this
08:30 - Name by 8 for
08:35 - example this will not be be valid
08:38 - because your variable is a string and
08:40 - you cannot multiply it by by some number
08:44 - so whenever I try to run this it will
08:48 - show me error use of undefined name
08:50 - assume name in this okay so in this way
08:55 - it will show or throw an error whenever
08:58 - you
09:00 - perform some invalid operations
09:03 - right so you can only do arithmetic
09:08 - operation on numerical values okay so
09:11 - this is this one it will show an invalid
09:15 - expression right now I've already shown
09:19 - you in the last video what Eco does eco
09:22 - is uh a command or a function you can
09:27 - use to Output the p parameter pass to it
09:31 - okay so the typical uses of for this is
09:36 - to send data to the client browser okay
09:40 - so we have seen this example but we will
09:43 - see this in detail also and its syntax
09:46 - is like this void Eco and it takes the
09:50 - string argument right
09:53 - and by default uh the functions in the
09:58 - PHP takes argument in parenthesis but
10:02 - because it's a inbuilt parameter or
10:06 - inbuilt function in PHP you don't need
10:09 - to give these parentheses in case of
10:12 - this Echo and let's see what how we can
10:16 - use echo in PHP so for example if you
10:21 - want to Echo the value of uh this bar so
10:26 - I can just use this Echo like
10:31 - this Echo and in the double quotes you
10:36 - can just pass this name with including
10:40 - this and
10:41 - symbol okay and end with semicolon and
10:45 - save this and run it once again and I
10:49 - can see the name programming knowledge
10:51 - here right in a similar
10:56 - way I can print for example I want to
11:00 - print this value and this value side by
11:03 - side what I can do here is I can just
11:08 - use it like
11:09 - this you don't even need to use these uh
11:14 - double Cotes here and you just need to
11:16 - use this comma and you can print these
11:20 - two values side by side by using
11:23 - separated by this comma also okay and
11:26 - when I run the program it will give the
11:29 - result hopefully like this you see
11:32 - programming knowledge and the value is
11:35 - 200 because we have multiplied our value
11:38 - by 8 so 25 multip by 8 is 200 and 200
11:43 - will be printed here okay and in the
11:47 - case of variable if you want to print
11:50 - only the variable you don't need to use
11:52 - these double quotes but if even you use
11:55 - this double quotes it uh will not make
11:59 - make much of a difference okay
12:03 - now for example if you want to print
12:06 - this value in addition with some uh
12:11 - your your um uh your values for example
12:15 - your strings you can do it like
12:18 - this
12:20 - Echo and for example you want to
12:24 - give uh
12:26 - 25 multiplied by
12:29 - 8 is equal to and you want to give this
12:34 - value right whatever is the value of
12:37 - your value so you can just write comma
12:40 - and the value and it will give you the
12:43 - result okay I will just comment these
12:46 - out so that only the value of this will
12:50 - be printed so I will save it and once I
12:55 - run this I see this result 25 5 into 8
12:59 - is equal to 200 so this is the value and
13:03 - this is the string we have printed okay
13:06 - so this will be the static value this is
13:09 - just a string we have U uh we we wanted
13:13 - to print but this is the value actual
13:15 - value you are printing here
13:18 - right you can even print uh the same
13:22 - thing without using commas so you can
13:27 - just exclude INE comma here and you can
13:30 - just include this inside your double
13:33 - quotes and the result will be the same
13:37 - so I will just comment this out save it
13:40 - and let's refresh our program and the
13:44 - result is same
13:46 - right so you can use this uh value to
13:51 - print like this using comma separator or
13:54 - you can use it like this but for example
13:59 - if you want to Echo in something in
14:03 - uh something using single codes for
14:07 - example I will Echo the same value using
14:11 - single quotes single quotation is just
14:14 - like this not the double quotation I'll
14:17 - remove these double
14:19 - quotations then what will happen
14:22 - whatever you include in single codes
14:24 - let's see first of all the result I will
14:27 - comment this out and save
14:29 - it and once again run
14:33 - this you only will be able to see this
14:36 - value that means whatever you print or
14:40 - whatever you write in single code the
14:43 - value of that will be taken literally
14:46 - literally means whatever you will
14:48 - include inside your single code it will
14:51 - it will be printed as it is it will not
14:54 - render this variable as the value 200 it
14:58 - will will be printed like this but on
15:00 - the other hand when you use double
15:02 - quotes your value will be rendered from
15:05 - here whatever is the value finalized
15:07 - value of it and it will printed so
15:10 - always use single code when you want to
15:13 - print something literally as it is and
15:16 - you can use double codes whenever you
15:18 - want to print the value of the variable
15:22 - or something like this so in this way
15:25 - you can
15:26 - use variables and Echo function in your
15:31 - PHP programming I hope you have enjoyed

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the fifth video tutorial on PHP programming for beginners and in this video we are going to see how to use and declare variables in PHP so till now in the last video I've shown you how to write your hello world first program and how to provide comment to your program right and by the way make sure that your Apache server is running using your control panel Sam control panel and you are able to see this Parent Directory in my case this was YouTube which I have made in my HD doc folder right and in the last video I have made one PHP file to test my Hello World program okay now in this video I'm going to make a new file so I will just click new I will save it as variable variable. PHP okay and once again when I refresh my program I will be able to see this variable. PHP but right now it's blank okay so first of all I will just write my skeleton and it will end like this right and let's see how variable Works in PHP okay so in PHP variable or PHP variables must begin with end sign okay so if you are used to uh uh some other variable declaration if you have learned C or C++ or Java and or any other um programming language you're used to uh using data type of the variable first and then the name and then you can assign the value to it but in PHP all variabl start with this end symbol and they don't start with any data type PHP interprets their value by the initialization they get okay and so let's see how we can declare a variable first of all what is a variable a variable is a container for some value okay so value variable is something that stores your value okay so in PHP we just need to Define this end and then the name of your variable so for example I can name my variable as um value for example and I can initialize this value by a number or a string so I will initialize this value by a number for example and by this initialization your variable knows or PHP knows that this variable which is value is of type integer right in the same way for example I can uh declare a um name for example this is the name of my variable and I can initialize this by a string so I can just write programming programming knowledge okay so by this initialization PHP knows that name is a string uh variable and by this initial initialization PHP knows that our value is a integer initialization or integer value right so unlike other languages PHP doesn't provide any data type right it only start with uh this end symbol and it is decided by the initialization of the variable what type it is okay now PHP variables are case sensitive so you can see that this variable with a capital b o is not equal to this this one I just need to change this this should be small B okay so let me change this so This boo which starts with with capital B is not equal to this boo which which start with with uh small B and this is even not equal to this boo so PHP variables are case sensitive okay now global and locally scoped variable Global variable can you can use it anywhere in the program and the local variable we can use inside a function or a class that we will see later okay and some of the variable names are reserved in PHP like post underscore Post in capital letters underscore get in capital letters these are form variables and in a similar way some server variables are reserved so you cannot declare a variable which is same as this server right in capital so some of the variables are reserved in PHP right now we move for further let's see the usage of of uh this variable so I have already shown you whatever you provide the value of variable it's called that variable so if you initialize uh a variable with a numerical value it will be called a numerical variable and if you initialize your variable by a string value it will be called string variable okay and these variables you can uh perform some multiplication or arithmetic operations but on string values you cannot do the these values because string you cannot uh multiply or divide or add add them together right so let's see this this also so for example I want to multiply this by by some values so I can write and and then the value is equal to and so whenever you use this value you need to initialize this by end so you know that this is a value right so you can do it like this you don't need to provide any space in in between and you can multiply this value by for example eight like this okay it will be completely valid but so let's try and run the program I will save it and I'll just refresh this and right now there is nothing printed and no error is coming that's uh that means our variable is uh I mean not giving any any error right no result because we are not printing anything right now that's why we are not seeing any result but it's not giving any error right but on the same on the other hand for example I want to multiply this name variable which is a string variable by the initialization so I can do something like this and I want to multiply by this Name by 8 for example this will not be be valid because your variable is a string and you cannot multiply it by by some number so whenever I try to run this it will show me error use of undefined name assume name in this okay so in this way it will show or throw an error whenever you perform some invalid operations right so you can only do arithmetic operation on numerical values okay so this is this one it will show an invalid expression right now I've already shown you in the last video what Eco does eco is uh a command or a function you can use to Output the p parameter pass to it okay so the typical uses of for this is to send data to the client browser okay so we have seen this example but we will see this in detail also and its syntax is like this void Eco and it takes the string argument right and by default uh the functions in the PHP takes argument in parenthesis but because it's a inbuilt parameter or inbuilt function in PHP you don't need to give these parentheses in case of this Echo and let's see what how we can use echo in PHP so for example if you want to Echo the value of uh this bar so I can just use this Echo like this Echo and in the double quotes you can just pass this name with including this and symbol okay and end with semicolon and save this and run it once again and I can see the name programming knowledge here right in a similar way I can print for example I want to print this value and this value side by side what I can do here is I can just use it like this you don't even need to use these uh double Cotes here and you just need to use this comma and you can print these two values side by side by using separated by this comma also okay and when I run the program it will give the result hopefully like this you see programming knowledge and the value is 200 because we have multiplied our value by 8 so 25 multip by 8 is 200 and 200 will be printed here okay and in the case of variable if you want to print only the variable you don't need to use these double quotes but if even you use this double quotes it uh will not make make much of a difference okay now for example if you want to print this value in addition with some uh your your um uh your values for example your strings you can do it like this Echo and for example you want to give uh 25 multiplied by 8 is equal to and you want to give this value right whatever is the value of your value so you can just write comma and the value and it will give you the result okay I will just comment these out so that only the value of this will be printed so I will save it and once I run this I see this result 25 5 into 8 is equal to 200 so this is the value and this is the string we have printed okay so this will be the static value this is just a string we have U uh we we wanted to print but this is the value actual value you are printing here right you can even print uh the same thing without using commas so you can just exclude INE comma here and you can just include this inside your double quotes and the result will be the same so I will just comment this out save it and let's refresh our program and the result is same right so you can use this uh value to print like this using comma separator or you can use it like this but for example if you want to Echo in something in uh something using single codes for example I will Echo the same value using single quotes single quotation is just like this not the double quotation I'll remove these double quotations then what will happen whatever you include in single codes let's see first of all the result I will comment this out and save it and once again run this you only will be able to see this value that means whatever you print or whatever you write in single code the value of that will be taken literally literally means whatever you will include inside your single code it will it will be printed as it is it will not render this variable as the value 200 it will will be printed like this but on the other hand when you use double quotes your value will be rendered from here whatever is the value finalized value of it and it will printed so always use single code when you want to print something literally as it is and you can use double codes whenever you want to print the value of the variable or something like this so in this way you can use variables and Echo function in your PHP programming I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
