00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video
00:02 - tutorial on connecting and using
00:06 - Microsoft access database with your
00:08 - Visual Basic windows for application
00:11 - project so let's get
00:14 - started I have this database here and
00:17 - first of all if you don't even know how
00:20 - to create a database in Access I have
00:24 - created uh a playlist for uh the
00:26 - beginners which you can refer to so just
00:30 - go to my channel which is programming
00:32 - knowledge and in here go to playlist tab
00:36 - here so click this playlist Tab and you
00:39 - will be able to find Microsoft Access
00:42 - tutorial for beginners so just click
00:44 - that and you can see some videos here
00:47 - and in here I I have shown you how you
00:50 - can create databases and how you can use
00:54 - databases and how you can query
00:56 - databases so it's a complete package for
00:59 - beginners if you don't even know how to
01:02 - create uh access database okay so once
01:06 - you know how to create an uh access
01:09 - database I have already created this
01:12 - database and my database name is employe
01:16 - data okay and I have some um columns
01:22 - here which are employ ID Eid first name
01:26 - last name date of birth Country phone
01:29 - and pay and I also have some data in
01:32 - this table of my database and which is
01:36 - from employe from employe ID 1 to
01:38 - employee ID 13 okay so now once you have
01:42 - your database created and you have some
01:45 - data in it you can just go to your
01:48 - visual studio and you can create a new
01:52 - Visual Basic project so what I'm going
01:55 - to do is I will click this new project
01:57 - and I'm going to make Windows Form
02:01 - application and in here I will change
02:03 - the name of my project
02:06 - as access
02:11 - DB tutorial and I will click
02:15 - okay this will create a project for
02:19 - us and I think you might uh know the
02:24 - basics of Visual Basic this is the
02:27 - solution Explorer and this is uh
02:30 - toolbox and what is uh most important to
02:34 - connect your database with your Visual
02:37 - Studio project is this section
02:41 - called data source okay so if you don't
02:45 - see this uh section here you can go to
02:49 - view and go to other windows and you can
02:52 - find this data source from here also
02:55 - right so now just go to this data source
03:00 - and we are going to create a new data
03:04 - source from here okay so I will say new
03:08 - data source just click this uh small
03:11 - icon on the
03:13 - left and this will open this uh wizard
03:17 - for you database wizard just select this
03:20 - database here and click next and once
03:23 - again click data data set here and click
03:28 - next and now you need to create the
03:32 - connection with your access database
03:35 - okay right now I don't have any
03:37 - connection right so for making the
03:40 - connection with your exess database you
03:43 - know need to know where your database is
03:47 - in your computer so for example this
03:51 - database which is employee info database
03:55 - is
03:56 - present in my somewhere in in my uh
04:00 - computer and in my access database
04:04 - folder so this is the path to my
04:07 - database file okay so just uh search for
04:12 - wherever you have created and saved your
04:16 - database the path you must know okay
04:19 - once again I will go to my Visual Basic
04:23 - uh Reser here and I will say new
04:28 - connection and we we are going to change
04:32 - the connection and we will choose here
04:35 - Microsoft access database file okay
04:39 - select this first option here and click
04:43 - okay and this will open this add
04:46 - connections here and you can now browse
04:49 - to uh the location where you have your
04:53 - database okay so just copy the path here
04:58 - go to your project paste your path here
05:01 - and you will reach to the destination of
05:04 - your database so select your database
05:07 - here and click open and for checking the
05:11 - connection with your database if your uh
05:14 - connection is uh successful or not you
05:17 - can click this test
05:19 - connection and if you see this test
05:22 - connection succeed then you are
05:25 - connected to your database now click
05:28 - okay
05:30 - and you will be able to see this
05:32 - employee or whatever your database name
05:36 - accdb
05:37 - connection next you will click the next
05:41 - button and you will see this message so
05:44 - read this message carefully the
05:46 - connection you selected users local
05:48 - database file that is not in the current
05:52 - project so it's saying
05:55 - that the connection you have created
05:57 - with the access database
06:00 - it's not present in your working
06:02 - directory of your project okay so my
06:05 - project for example is located in in
06:10 - somewhere in my visual studio folder and
06:14 - there are there is a folder there called
06:17 - projects and my project is here so where
06:22 - is my project I will search for
06:27 - it and in case you will not find your
06:30 - project you recently created you can
06:33 - just go to go back to your Visual Studio
06:35 - 2010 or whatever version you have and go
06:38 - to the backup files here because you
06:40 - haven't saved your project till now it
06:43 - will be in your backup files so here you
06:45 - have access DB tutorial so this is my
06:50 - database and here right now I don't have
06:54 - anything right which is uh this so I'm
06:59 - this is this wizard is asking me if this
07:03 - database is present in my project folder
07:07 - or not so this is not present right so I
07:11 - will say yes and if you click yes
07:14 - button Visual Basic or Visual Studio
07:17 - will copy your database to your working
07:21 - project so I will click yes or if you
07:25 - don't need to copy this database to your
07:28 - project you can click no And the
07:30 - connection will be fine there will be no
07:32 - difficulty but I will say yes for
07:36 - now and now it will create a connection
07:40 - string which is called employee info
07:42 - connection string I will uh leave it as
07:45 - default and click next and now you will
07:48 - be able to see the tables here
07:52 - so if you want you can select all the
07:57 - columns you want to show in your or you
08:01 - want to use in your project so I will
08:03 - just select this top button or the top
08:07 - check what check box and it will click
08:11 - all the all the check boxes and I will
08:15 - click
08:17 - finish so now I have one data source
08:21 - which is connected to Microsoft access
08:25 - database
08:27 - okay now first thing I will do is I will
08:30 - save my project so I will click this
08:32 - button save all and it will give me save
08:35 - project uh option and all the things are
08:39 - default I will click save and as soon as
08:42 - I click save my project will be saved
08:46 - here okay so now my project is saved I
08:50 - can check it whether it's present in my
08:53 - project folder or not so once you save
08:56 - it will go into Visual Basic projects
08:58 - and you can see here access database
09:00 - tutorial project and once again when I
09:03 - go inside this folder you will be able
09:05 - to see this employee info uh connection
09:09 - or database here in this folder so
09:12 - that's what I meant by uh copying your
09:16 - database into your working project okay
09:20 - now that's
09:21 - done now just go to this data source
09:25 - here what just and you can just pin it
09:29 - this here so you will be able to see it
09:33 - always and what you need to do is just
09:35 - click this database name here which is
09:38 - employee data in my case and the when
09:42 - you click this
09:43 - small combo box button here you will see
09:47 - data grid View and details so just
09:50 - select details for now select this
09:52 - details so I have selected there will be
09:55 - no change uh here you will be able to
09:58 - see but details is selected right now
10:01 - okay now what you need to do is just
10:05 - select
10:07 - your database and drag and drop into
10:11 - your form okay so what you need to do
10:15 - you just need to select this database
10:17 - and drag and drop into the form okay so
10:22 - I dragged and drop into the form and as
10:25 - soon as you drop this database into your
10:28 - form you will be able to see all these
10:31 - text boxes and labels with the real name
10:35 - of your columns which you have here so I
10:38 - have Eid first name last name do date of
10:41 - birth which is do Country phone and pay
10:44 - you will be a able to see all here
10:48 - Eid first name last name do OB
10:51 - Country phone and pay and this Visual
10:56 - Basic even recognizes uh that this do is
11:01 - a
11:02 - datetime data type so if you see here
11:05 - this do is the date of birth right and
11:10 - this when I go to the design view this
11:14 - do is a date time data type so it
11:17 - recognizes that it's a date time data
11:19 - type it will give you this date time
11:22 - tool for you okay so I will give you the
11:26 - demonstration for that but let's make
11:30 - our form a little bit bigger you will be
11:32 - able to see these um connection binding
11:35 - source connection uh data table adopter
11:38 - and all the these things here also now
11:41 - for example I want a
11:44 - table in my form and I want to see all
11:48 - all the data which is in
11:51 - my in my database table access database
11:55 - table right so what I'm going to do is I
11:57 - will uh go to my toolbox which is this
12:01 - one and I will select datag grid view
12:04 - here and as soon as I select my data
12:07 - grid view let me just resize it so I can
12:12 - see my
12:16 - data okay so I resize it and once you
12:20 - have resized it just go to this small
12:23 - little button triangle button here and
12:27 - right now there is no data source so you
12:29 - need to choose data source go here
12:32 - choose data source and you will be able
12:35 - to see your employee data binding Source
12:37 - or whatever name of your database you
12:40 - will be able to see The Binding source
12:43 - for that so my database name is employee
12:47 - data so I will select this and as soon
12:49 - as you select this you will be able to
12:51 - see all the columns from your database
12:54 - in
12:55 - your data grid view or table you can you
12:58 - can also select this enable column
13:01 - rendering and just you will be able to
13:06 - see this here now once you have done you
13:09 - have everything you have table you have
13:13 - text boxes to enter the data and you
13:15 - have labels to indicate which data
13:18 - represent what now you can run your data
13:21 - or you run your
13:23 - project and you will be able to see all
13:26 - the data which is present in my database
13:30 - which is from employee ID 1 to 13 in
13:34 - here in this table I can even navigate
13:38 - through the uh this table by clicking
13:42 - this button move next so this will move
13:45 - next next next next next like this right
13:49 - and move previous you can even go to the
13:53 - last data and First Data by clicking
13:56 - these buttons you can add
13:59 - an employee also or you can add a new
14:01 - data by clicking this plus sign and as
14:05 - soon as you click this button your
14:08 - cursor go goes to here so right now I
14:11 - have 13 employee I will add the 14th
14:13 - employee
14:15 - 14 and the name is
14:18 - uh Paul for
14:21 - example um some
14:25 - surname and the date of birth I can

14:44 - 4 5 6 7 8 9 okay and pay is for
14:50 - example 40 40 per hour okay and once you
14:56 - have entered your data you you can just
14:59 - click the save data and you will be able
15:02 - to see your data here
15:05 - right
15:07 - now if you might be wondering if this
15:10 - data you changed is is edited here also
15:16 - so let me refresh my data and you will
15:19 - see if you see that your data is not
15:23 - refreshing here then probably you are
15:27 - opening the wrong
15:29 - database so as I have told you your
15:34 - database is uh your database location
15:38 - was here in what wherever you have saved
15:40 - your database but once you have clicked
15:43 - that yes button when I was running the
15:46 - wizard it has copied your database in
15:50 - your project folder right so project
15:54 - access database in here I have bin
15:58 - folder
15:59 - go to bin go to debug and your database
16:03 - is this one right your database is
16:05 - copied to this debug folder of yours so
16:11 - this database is copied to this debug
16:15 - folder so now the working copy of exess
16:18 - database is not the original place or
16:22 - original folder at which you have saved
16:24 - your database but your project folder
16:27 - and in that bin and debug folder this is
16:30 - your database and when I open this
16:32 - database right click and open or open
16:35 - with access Microsoft Access now you
16:39 - will be able to see your database and
16:42 - all the changes I will say enable
16:46 - Okay and I will open this table and you
16:49 - see the 14th employee is added here so
16:52 - just remember here remember this that
16:55 - your database is copied to your working
16:59 - directory of your Visual Basic project
17:02 - okay once again I want to add a new
17:05 - employee add 15 employee ID 15 some name
17:10 - some
17:11 - surname and date of birth for example I
17:14 - will choose country I will choose UK for
17:18 - example phone once again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

17:32 - and my data is added here and once you
17:35 - go to your database once again refresh
17:38 - it and your data you will be able to see
17:41 - in this access database also okay and
17:45 - you can even delete your data by
17:47 - clicking this cross
17:50 - button so in this way you can connect uh
17:54 - the access database to your Visual Basic
17:58 - Windows Form application project now in
18:01 - the next video I will also show you how
18:04 - you can add save previous next buttons
18:08 - because the buttons you have added right
18:11 - now when you double click them so double
18:15 - click this and you will go to the
18:17 - project you will not be able to see what
18:20 - is the code behind all these uh buttons
18:23 - okay so I will show you how you can
18:26 - write a codes manually to copy or to
18:31 - emulate the same functionality of this
18:33 - next previous buttons add data or save

hello guys welcome to the first video tutorial on connecting and using Microsoft access database with your Visual Basic windows for application project so let's get started I have this database here and first of all if you don't even know how to create a database in Access I have created uh a playlist for uh the beginners which you can refer to so just go to my channel which is programming knowledge and in here go to playlist tab here so click this playlist Tab and you will be able to find Microsoft Access tutorial for beginners so just click that and you can see some videos here and in here I I have shown you how you can create databases and how you can use databases and how you can query databases so it's a complete package for beginners if you don't even know how to create uh

employ ID Eid first name last name date of birth Country phone and pay and I also have some data in this table of my database and which is from employe from employe ID 1 to employee ID 13 okay so now once you have your database created and you have some data in it you can just go to your visual studio and you can create a new Visual Basic project so what I'm going to do is I will click this new project and I'm going to make Windows Form application and in here I will change the name of my project as access DB tutorial and I will click okay this will create a project for us and I think you might uh know the basics of Visual Basic this is the solution Explorer and this is uh toolbox and what is uh most important to connect your database with your Visual Studio project is this section called data source okay so if you don't see this uh section here you can go to view and go to other windows and you can find this data source from here also right so now just go to this data source and we are going to create a new data source from here okay so I will say new data source just click this uh small icon on the left and this will open this uh wizard for you database wizard just select this database here and click next and once again click data data set here and click next and now you need to create the connection with your access database okay right now I don't have any connection right so for making the connection with your exess database you know need to know where your database is in your computer so for example this database which is employee info database is present in my somewhere in in my uh computer and in my access database folder so this is the path to my database file okay so just uh search for wherever you have created and saved your database the path you must know okay once again I will go to my Visual Basic uh Reser here and I will say new connection and we we are going to change the connection and we will choose here Microsoft access database file okay select this first option here and click okay and this will open this add connections here and you can now browse to uh the location where you have your database okay so just copy the path here go to your project paste your path here and you will reach to the destination of your database so select your database here and click open and for checking the connection with your database if your uh connection is uh successful or not you can click this test connection and if you see this test connection succeed then you are connected to your database now click okay and you will be able to see this employee or whatever your database name accdb connection next you will click the next button and you will see this message so read this message carefully the connection you selected users local database file that is not in the current project so it's saying that the connection you have created with the access database it's not present in your working directory of your project okay so my project for example is located in in somewhere in my visual studio folder and there are there is a folder there called projects and my project is here so where is my project I will search for it and in case you will not find your project you recently created you can just go to go back to your Visual Studio 2010 or whatever version you have and go to the backup files here because you haven't saved your project till now it will be in your backup files so here you have access DB tutorial so this is my database and here right now I don't have anything right which is uh this so I'm this is this wizard is asking me if this database is present in my project folder or not so this is not present right so I will say yes and if you click yes button Visual Basic or Visual Studio will copy your database to your working project so I will click yes or if you don't need to copy this database to your project you can click no And the connection will be fine there will be no difficulty but I will say yes for now and now it will create a connection string which is called employee info connection string I will uh leave it as default and click next and now you will be able to see the tables here so if you want you can select all the columns you want to show in your or you want to use in your project so I will just select this top button or the top check what check box and it will click all the all the check boxes and I will click finish so now I have one data source which is connected to Microsoft access database okay now first thing I will do is I will save my project so I will click this button save all and it will give me save project uh option and all the things are default I will click save and as soon as I click save my project will be saved here okay so now my project is saved I can check it whether it's present in my project folder or not so once you save it will go into Visual Basic projects and you can see here access database tutorial project and once again when I go inside this folder you will be able to see this employee info uh connection or database here in this folder so that's what I meant by uh copying your database into your working project okay now that's done now just go to this data source here what just and you can just pin it this here so you will be able to see it always and what you need to do is just click this database name here which is employee data in my case and the when you click this small combo box button here you will see data grid View and details so just select details for now select this details so I have selected there will be no change uh here you will be able to see but details is selected right now okay now what you need to do is just select your database and drag and drop into your form okay so what you need to do you just need to select this database and drag and drop into the form okay so I dragged and drop into the form and as soon as you drop this database into your form you will be able to see all these text boxes and labels with the real name of your columns which you have here so I have Eid first name last name do date of birth which is do Country phone and pay you will be a able to see all here Eid first name last name do OB Country phone and pay and this Visual Basic even recognizes uh that this do is a datetime data type so if you see here this do is the date of birth right and this when I go to the design view this do is a date time data type so it recognizes that it's a date time data type it will give you this date time tool for you okay so I will give you the demonstration for that but let's make our form a little bit bigger you will be able to see these um connection binding source connection uh data table adopter and all the these things here also now for example I want a table in my form and I want to see all all the data which is in my in my database table access database table right so what I'm going to do is I will uh go to my toolbox which is this one and I will select datag grid view here and as soon as I select my data grid view let me just resize it so I can see my data okay so I resize it and once you have resized it just go to this small little button triangle button here and right now there is no data source so you need to choose data source go here choose data source and you will be able to see your employee data binding Source or whatever name of your database you will be able to see The Binding source for that so my database name is employee data so I will select this and as soon as you select this you will be able to see all the columns from your database in your data grid view or table you can you can also select this enable column rendering and just you will be able to see this here now once you have done you have everything you have table you have text boxes to enter the data and you have labels to indicate which data represent what now you can run your data or you run your project and you will be able to see all the data which is present in my database which is from employee ID 1 to 13 in here in this table I can even navigate through the uh this table by clicking this button move next so this will move next next next next next like this right and move previous you can even go to the last data and First Data by clicking these buttons you can add an employee also or you can add a new data by clicking this plus sign and as soon as you click this button your cursor go goes to here so right now I have 13 employee I will add the 14th employee 14 and the name is uh Paul for example um some surname and the date of birth I can choose the date of birth from here so I will select first of all year year is 1980 April for example February country is USA for example phone number is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 okay and pay is for example 40 40 per hour okay and once you have entered your data you you can just click the save data and you will be able to see your data here right now if you might be wondering if this data you changed is is edited here also so let me refresh my data and you will see if you see that your data is not refreshing here then probably you are opening the wrong database so as I have told you your database is uh your database location was here in what wherever you have saved your database but once you have clicked that yes button when I was running the wizard it has copied your database in your project folder right so project access database in here I have bin folder go to bin go to debug and your database is this one right your database is copied to this debug folder of yours so this database is copied to this debug folder so now the working copy of exess database is not the original place or original folder at which you have saved your database but your project folder and in that bin and debug folder this is your database and when I open this database right click and open or open with access Microsoft Access now you will be able to see your database
