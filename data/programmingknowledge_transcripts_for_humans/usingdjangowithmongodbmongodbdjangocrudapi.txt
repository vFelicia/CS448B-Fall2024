With timestamps:

00:00 - so basically in today's tutorial we are
00:01 - going to connect the django
00:03 - with mongodb and i will illustrate
00:06 - all the process how you can uh create a
00:09 - mongodb
00:10 - database and how you can connect that
00:11 - mongodb database with your django
00:13 - application
00:14 - so let's get started with today's
00:16 - tutorial the first thing we need to do
00:18 - we can open our code editor and then we
00:21 - need to type the command
00:23 - pip install
00:27 - django so this will install the django
00:30 - on our local machine
00:31 - and with this command we can create a
00:33 - django project as well as the django app
00:35 - on our machine
00:37 - then then i would like to tell you that
00:40 - till the time this is being installed on
00:42 - my machine what you can do
00:44 - yeah here you can see that it is
00:46 - installed in django on my machine
00:48 - and you can install django with the
00:50 - simple command pip install django
00:52 - and then we have a mongodb plus i will
00:55 - show you how the
00:56 - we can go here you can refer to this
00:58 - website uh first this is the
01:00 - website for django i've already told you
01:02 - how you can install django
01:04 - then this is the website from here you
01:06 - can install the mongodb community
01:08 - edition and this works as a interface
01:11 - with you
01:12 - with the mongodb database as a user
01:14 - interface
01:15 - uh very similar to phpmyadmin
01:19 - which is used for sql then this is the
01:22 - package we are going to use
01:23 - this package has a very similar name
01:25 - jungle
01:26 - the word jungle is derived from uh like
01:28 - uh this is used to connect django with
01:31 - mongodb
01:32 - so jungle is the package we are going to
01:34 - use so let's get back to our code editor
01:37 - so first what you can do you can
01:40 - connect here to the uh connect to the
01:43 - local host server
01:44 - using this mongodb compass community
01:46 - edition
01:47 - and you can click on the connect button
01:50 - then this would connect to the local
01:51 - host
01:52 - now here you can see that it has been
01:54 - connected to the local host
01:56 - now what you can do you can create your
01:58 - own database
01:59 - so let's click on here uh so first
02:03 - let's continue with installation part so
02:05 - after installing uh
02:06 - after installing django you can install
02:09 - it
02:11 - install jungle
02:14 - so this is the command we are going to
02:15 - use to connect with the
02:17 - package this is the package we are going
02:19 - to use to connect django with the
02:20 - mongodb database
02:22 - so it's very easy so till the time it's
02:25 - being installed
02:26 - yeah it's a very easy process and next
02:29 - what we can do then we can create a
02:32 - django project
02:33 - and then we would i will show you how
02:35 - you can make a migration in your app
02:38 - then how the how we when you can change
02:40 - see the changes detected in the
02:42 - mongodb database so let's what we
02:45 - what we can do uh next what i have
02:48 - so then you have to make some uh changes
02:51 - in your settings dot py
02:52 - file i'll also come to that then you can
02:55 - see the changes on the mongodb com
02:57 - compass so that's very easy so let's
03:00 - create our django project
03:01 - so i'll type django admin
03:05 - start project
03:08 - a demo project
03:11 - so i'll create a project
03:15 - then what you can do you can open a
03:17 - folder
03:19 - and i have created this project on my
03:21 - desktop
03:22 - so here i can open it so
03:26 - now the project is open on my vs code
03:29 - so next thing you can do you will i'll
03:32 - navigate you to the
03:33 - settings dot py file so you can press
03:36 - ctrl dot p
03:37 - and if settings dot pi file so this
03:40 - would
03:41 - simply direct you to the settings dot py
03:43 - file
03:44 - and here you can see that there is a
03:46 - section for databases
03:48 - so we would be doing this and i will
03:50 - open my terminal as well
03:52 - so we would be connecting this uh so
03:55 - what we can do
03:56 - uh first since we have installed jungle
03:59 - now what we can do first uh we will
04:02 - create a database i will show you
04:04 - like from here you can disconnect and
04:06 - connect
04:07 - so i'll show you again very first you
04:09 - disconnect then you can click on connect
04:12 - so this would connect you to the
04:13 - localhost database and
04:15 - now click on create database and type
04:18 - demo database
04:22 - remove database and you can give a
04:24 - collection name
04:25 - a demo election
04:29 - so i would click on create database
04:32 - so here you can just copy the you can
04:35 - keep this as a referral demo database
04:37 - so and demo collection so i click on
04:40 - create database
04:41 - so here you can see a database has been
04:43 - created and
04:44 - which is having a just a demo collection
04:47 - right now
04:48 - but what we can do uh we will
04:51 - connect to our project and then run the
04:54 - app
04:54 - so i'll sorry run the migration so what
04:57 - you can do you can simply copy this
05:00 - and you can paste this code i'll comment
05:02 - this
05:03 - out databases so i'll put triple quotes
05:05 - here
05:06 - so this would basically come in this
05:08 - section double quotes
05:10 - and now i would miss this you can do one
05:13 - thing
05:14 - you can remove this client part because
05:16 - you are right now dealing with the local
05:18 - host and by default it would detect this
05:21 - so now you need to define your database
05:24 - name
05:25 - so i would define my database oh sorry
05:28 - so my database name is this this is my
05:32 - database demo database so i'll
05:35 - move to this here and i'll type demo
05:38 - data
05:39 - base okay so this looks perfect
05:44 - now uh since i'm my connection is on so
05:47 - i'll type
05:48 - a python manage
05:54 - dot ui make
05:57 - migrations
06:00 - and this would make the migrations in my
06:04 - database so so it says no change is
06:07 - detected
06:08 - so uh now i can type python manage.py
06:12 - migrate so here you can see
06:16 - the all the ibra migrations uh are being
06:19 - applied
06:20 - so here you can see the migration has
06:21 - been applied now i will move to my
06:23 - database and i'll click on the refresh
06:25 - button
06:26 - and here you can see and i click on the
06:28 - demo database perfect
06:30 - so i have got all the migrations of the
06:32 - django here
06:33 - in my mongodb database so
06:37 - this looks perfectly fine so you can
06:40 - create your models and then run the
06:42 - previous two command that is migrate and
06:44 - migrations
06:45 - and then you are get to go with this a
06:48 - project running
06:49 - so thank you guys for watching this
06:51 - video so i'll catch up in the next
06:53 - tutorial
06:54 - so here you can see i have made the
06:55 - project uh you can also do one thing
06:58 - you can type python manage
07:02 - dot ui run
07:05 - server so this would run the app on your
07:09 - local machine
07:10 - so you can simply copy this
07:15 - and you can place this on your browser
07:21 - and here you can see your django project
07:23 - is perfectly running so everything looks
07:25 - perfect
07:26 - so this is how i made the settings in my
07:28 - database uh this is the
07:30 - mongodb collections what i've got and
07:32 - this the project is already running
07:34 - but now we are trying to implement crud
07:36 - operations the basically there are four
07:38 - card operations that is create read
07:40 - update and delete and we are going to
07:42 - implement this using mongodb so first
07:44 - thing you can do is you can
07:45 - open this mongodb compass community
07:47 - edition and you can click on connect
07:50 - when you click on connect you can last
07:52 - in the last video i showed you how we
07:53 - created a demo database here
07:55 - then you can open the demo database and
07:58 - here you can see all the migrations
08:00 - the demo database has all the migrations
08:02 - we had done so you can refer to the
08:03 - previous tutorial how we connected
08:05 - mongodb to django it's very simple
08:07 - and it's very quick enough so i can also
08:10 - give you a quick view
08:11 - uh in settings dot py file you need to
08:15 - uh go into setting dot py file and what
08:18 - you need to do where you need to
08:19 - make sure that this database engine is
08:22 - jungle and
08:23 - uh you have to install a dem uh you have
08:25 - to make a demo database
08:27 - and the name of that database is very
08:29 - much the same demo database and you have
08:31 - to install a package called jungle
08:33 - so it can be easily installed by the by
08:36 - typing the command pim install jungle uh
08:38 - for
08:39 - for any like if you want to see it as a
08:41 - demo purpose you can refer to the
08:42 - previous video
08:44 - uh now what we are going to prevent the
08:46 - crowd operations so we will
08:48 - go step by step and we will see how we
08:50 - can
08:51 - uh create a app and then how we can
08:53 - implement the
08:54 - uh how we can implement the uh thread
08:57 - operation in that app
08:59 - so what you can do you can simply copy
09:01 - this or you can
09:02 - type on your vs code python
09:06 - manage dot py start
09:09 - app demo app so
09:12 - this would uh start a demo app
09:16 - inside your current project directory
09:18 - and now what you can do
09:21 - instead uh until the time it's been
09:23 - created creating a demo app i can show
09:26 - you further commands
09:27 - uh this is the one like uh
09:30 - i'll show you uh we are going to
09:32 - implement a database model
09:34 - so this how we make a database model we
09:37 - will make
09:37 - then we will create a super user and
09:40 - this is a administration i will show you
09:43 - that
09:43 - and i'll simply show you so
09:48 - okay so let's uh get back to our
09:51 - tutorial
09:51 - see the demo app has been created you
09:53 - can see the folder here demo app
09:55 - and it has a file called module.pyfi
09:58 - since i have created
09:59 - an app demo app i need to make sure i
10:02 - add this application here
10:04 - demo app okay now what you need to do
10:07 - i've already connected to my database
10:09 - and the next thing i'm going to do i'll
10:11 - move to modules.pi file
10:13 - and i need to create my models here so
10:15 - simply i'll create a model
10:17 - and i'll make create a basic model see
10:20 - this one
10:21 - uh i'll copy this and paste it here
10:25 - instead of this i'll do class to do
10:29 - and this is the this is instead of first
10:31 - name i'll type
10:32 - task and instead of the second
10:36 - last name i'll do this to description
10:38 - this
10:39 - grip so this is the description i'm
10:42 - going to have
10:43 - task is your model is not category and
10:45 - this is the description here i can
10:47 - increase the description to 100
10:50 - perfect uh yeah okay
10:53 - now i have increased the description to
10:55 - 100 and now what we can do
10:58 - inside my dot py file i can register
11:01 - this
11:02 - and for that i need to do what i need to
11:04 - do i need to
11:05 - first import models from dot models
11:08 - import
11:09 - everything so i from dot models import
11:11 - star and
11:12 - here you can see that i have registered
11:15 - i can register a model here
11:17 - so i i can copy this and paste it here
11:21 - uh yeah so here you can see uh i can uh
11:24 - you know import that model and register
11:26 - here as an admin so i can implement the
11:28 - third operation so i'll
11:30 - simply type to do so to do is the model
11:34 - which i have to register and
11:37 - i will create a super user at the same
11:39 - time python manage dot
11:41 - py create super
11:45 - user so this is the type of command i
11:47 - have to type to
11:48 - create the super user so it will ask me
11:52 - to like a username so here you can
11:55 - give a username as admin you can leave
11:58 - this email address
11:59 - password you have to give a very simple
12:01 - one
12:02 - uh and then again you can give a
12:04 - password the make sure it's an easy one
12:06 - just for the demo purpose and
12:08 - you can continue that and now so this
12:11 - password seems to be too common but you
12:13 - type y
12:14 - that is yes and it will create the super
12:16 - user
12:17 - now since i created the model database
12:19 - model and i also listed
12:21 - that so now what i will do i will
12:23 - migrate this database
12:25 - python manage
12:28 - sorry python manage
12:32 - dot py make migrations
12:36 - and now what i'll do so here you can see
12:39 - it shows that
12:40 - create model to do now i'll migrate this
12:42 - python
12:43 - manage dot py sorry
12:47 - python manage dot p y uh
12:50 - my grade now i will migrate this
12:52 - database
12:54 - so yeah here you can see so
12:57 - uh i have made this and now what i'm
13:00 - going to do
13:01 - i'll go to my demo database and i'll
13:03 - refresh this
13:05 - okay so here you can see
13:08 - that i have got a demo app to do here
13:11 - here you can see
13:12 - demo app to do now what i'll do
13:15 - i'll run this app python
13:18 - manage dot py
13:22 - manage dot py run server
13:27 - okay now the app will start and start at
13:30 - the local host so i'll move to my local
13:32 - host
13:32 - so like we have created the model profit
13:34 - we have registered
13:35 - as admin perfect and now uh
13:38 - okay this seems to be something else
13:40 - sorry uh yeah
13:42 - now i have created an app which i told
13:45 - you
13:45 - that and then we registered the app
13:47 - inside the installed apps directory as
13:48 - well
13:49 - so we are going in the right direction
13:50 - now i'm at my local host i'll refresh
13:52 - this
13:53 - and you can see that i have my app
13:55 - successfully running
13:57 - now i will go to the admin slash
14:00 - admin so simply we refer to the
14:04 - documentation for the quick illustration
14:06 - of this and
14:07 - the you need to type in the username and
14:09 - password you have set
14:11 - and what you need to do then you can log
14:14 - in here
14:15 - and here you can see i have to do's so
14:18 - you can add a to-do here simply we are
14:21 - going to implement the crowd operations
14:22 - so
14:24 - to do number one
14:27 - so a hello world i'll type simply type
14:31 - hello world
14:32 - anything you can give hello world and
14:35 - now i'll save this
14:37 - uh let me i'll either i'll do save and
14:39 - add another or i can save this
14:41 - yeah so this has been saved and here you
14:44 - can see the object says
14:46 - yeah this is i have the object okay so
14:49 - i'm clicking on save again yeah but now
14:51 - when i move to my database i click on
14:53 - this demo have to do
14:54 - and here you can see
14:58 - that you have this data in the json
15:00 - format so perfectly
15:01 - fine so here you can see that i have the
15:03 - data in the
15:04 - json format uh since it's mongodb
15:08 - okay uh i'll quickly show you yeah you
15:10 - can see this in the
15:12 - uh json format so and this is the
15:15 - uh you can also click on this button so
15:17 - this would show you in the tabular form
15:19 - and this will show you in the json form
15:21 - it's perfectly fine
15:22 - so let's implement some few operations
15:24 - on that again now i click to do to do
15:26 - app
15:26 - project and i get to number one edited
15:31 - so i click save so this has been edited
15:35 - so when i move to my database i'll click
15:37 - on refresh
15:39 - i'll click here refresh button yeah now
15:41 - it says doodle number one edited
15:43 - now simply i can add another view so
15:47 - to do number two
15:51 - number two and i'll give the same
15:53 - description yeah and
15:54 - then i can move to my database refresh
15:57 - i'll get another one
15:58 - and now i can delete one so that's makes
16:01 - a
16:02 - last purpose of our project i'll delete
16:04 - this yes i'm sure
16:06 - i'll delete this and i'm gonna move to
16:08 - my database i found it deleted
16:10 - so that's perfectly fine how we
16:12 - implement the create operations
16:13 - so thank you guys thank you so much for
16:15 - joining us in this tutorial
16:17 - so this was the quick purpose you can
16:19 - simply create a doodle app
16:20 - and with the database

Cleaned transcript:

so basically in today's tutorial we are going to connect the django with mongodb and i will illustrate all the process how you can uh create a mongodb database and how you can connect that mongodb database with your django application so let's get started with today's tutorial the first thing we need to do we can open our code editor and then we need to type the command pip install django so this will install the django on our local machine and with this command we can create a django project as well as the django app on our machine then then i would like to tell you that till the time this is being installed on my machine what you can do yeah here you can see that it is installed in django on my machine and you can install django with the simple command pip install django and then we have a mongodb plus i will show you how the we can go here you can refer to this website uh first this is the website for django i've already told you how you can install django then this is the website from here you can install the mongodb community edition and this works as a interface with you with the mongodb database as a user interface uh very similar to phpmyadmin which is used for sql then this is the package we are going to use this package has a very similar name jungle the word jungle is derived from uh like uh this is used to connect django with mongodb so jungle is the package we are going to use so let's get back to our code editor so first what you can do you can connect here to the uh connect to the local host server using this mongodb compass community edition and you can click on the connect button then this would connect to the local host now here you can see that it has been connected to the local host now what you can do you can create your own database so let's click on here uh so first let's continue with installation part so after installing uh after installing django you can install it install jungle so this is the command we are going to use to connect with the package this is the package we are going to use to connect django with the mongodb database so it's very easy so till the time it's being installed yeah it's a very easy process and next what we can do then we can create a django project and then we would i will show you how you can make a migration in your app then how the how we when you can change see the changes detected in the mongodb database so let's what we what we can do uh next what i have so then you have to make some uh changes in your settings dot py file i'll also come to that then you can see the changes on the mongodb com compass so that's very easy so let's create our django project so i'll type django admin start project a demo project so i'll create a project then what you can do you can open a folder and i have created this project on my desktop so here i can open it so now the project is open on my vs code so next thing you can do you will i'll navigate you to the settings dot py file so you can press ctrl dot p and if settings dot pi file so this would simply direct you to the settings dot py file and here you can see that there is a section for databases so we would be doing this and i will open my terminal as well so we would be connecting this uh so what we can do uh first since we have installed jungle now what we can do first uh we will create a database i will show you like from here you can disconnect and connect so i'll show you again very first you disconnect then you can click on connect so this would connect you to the localhost database and now click on create database and type demo database remove database and you can give a collection name a demo election so i would click on create database so here you can just copy the you can keep this as a referral demo database so and demo collection so i click on create database so here you can see a database has been created and which is having a just a demo collection right now but what we can do uh we will connect to our project and then run the app so i'll sorry run the migration so what you can do you can simply copy this and you can paste this code i'll comment this out databases so i'll put triple quotes here so this would basically come in this section double quotes and now i would miss this you can do one thing you can remove this client part because you are right now dealing with the local host and by default it would detect this so now you need to define your database name so i would define my database oh sorry so my database name is this this is my database demo database so i'll move to this here and i'll type demo data base okay so this looks perfect now uh since i'm my connection is on so i'll type a python manage dot ui make migrations and this would make the migrations in my database so so it says no change is detected so uh now i can type python manage.py migrate so here you can see the all the ibra migrations uh are being applied so here you can see the migration has been applied now i will move to my database and i'll click on the refresh button and here you can see and i click on the demo database perfect so i have got all the migrations of the django here in my mongodb database so this looks perfectly fine so you can create your models and then run the previous two command that is migrate and migrations and then you are get to go with this a project running so thank you guys for watching this video so i'll catch up in the next tutorial so here you can see i have made the project uh you can also do one thing you can type python manage dot ui run server so this would run the app on your local machine so you can simply copy this and you can place this on your browser and here you can see your django project is perfectly running so everything looks perfect so this is how i made the settings in my database uh this is the mongodb collections what i've got and this the project is already running but now we are trying to implement crud operations the basically there are four card operations that is create read update and delete and we are going to implement this using mongodb so first thing you can do is you can open this mongodb compass community edition and you can click on connect when you click on connect you can last in the last video i showed you how we created a demo database here then you can open the demo database and here you can see all the migrations the demo database has all the migrations we had done so you can refer to the previous tutorial how we connected mongodb to django it's very simple and it's very quick enough so i can also give you a quick view uh in settings dot py file you need to uh go into setting dot py file and what you need to do where you need to make sure that this database engine is jungle and uh you have to install a dem uh you have to make a demo database and the name of that database is very much the same demo database and you have to install a package called jungle so it can be easily installed by the by typing the command pim install jungle uh for for any like if you want to see it as a demo purpose you can refer to the previous video uh now what we are going to prevent the crowd operations so we will go step by step and we will see how we can uh create a app and then how we can implement the uh how we can implement the uh thread operation in that app so what you can do you can simply copy this or you can type on your vs code python manage dot py start app demo app so this would uh start a demo app inside your current project directory and now what you can do instead uh until the time it's been created creating a demo app i can show you further commands uh this is the one like uh i'll show you uh we are going to implement a database model so this how we make a database model we will make then we will create a super user and this is a administration i will show you that and i'll simply show you so okay so let's uh get back to our tutorial see the demo app has been created you can see the folder here demo app and it has a file called module.pyfi since i have created an app demo app i need to make sure i add this application here demo app okay now what you need to do i've already connected to my database and the next thing i'm going to do i'll move to modules.pi file and i need to create my models here so simply i'll create a model and i'll make create a basic model see this one uh i'll copy this and paste it here instead of this i'll do class to do and this is the this is instead of first name i'll type task and instead of the second last name i'll do this to description this grip so this is the description i'm going to have task is your model is not category and this is the description here i can increase the description to 100 perfect uh yeah okay now i have increased the description to 100 and now what we can do inside my dot py file i can register this and for that i need to do what i need to do i need to first import models from dot models import everything so i from dot models import star and here you can see that i have registered i can register a model here so i i can copy this and paste it here uh yeah so here you can see uh i can uh you know import that model and register here as an admin so i can implement the third operation so i'll simply type to do so to do is the model which i have to register and i will create a super user at the same time python manage dot py create super user so this is the type of command i have to type to create the super user so it will ask me to like a username so here you can give a username as admin you can leave this email address password you have to give a very simple one uh and then again you can give a password the make sure it's an easy one just for the demo purpose and you can continue that and now so this password seems to be too common but you type y that is yes and it will create the super user now since i created the model database model and i also listed that so now what i will do i will migrate this database python manage sorry python manage dot py make migrations and now what i'll do so here you can see it shows that create model to do now i'll migrate this python manage dot py sorry python manage dot p y uh my grade now i will migrate this database so yeah here you can see so uh i have made this and now what i'm going to do i'll go to my demo database and i'll refresh this okay so here you can see that i have got a demo app to do here here you can see demo app to do now what i'll do i'll run this app python manage dot py manage dot py run server okay now the app will start and start at the local host so i'll move to my local host so like we have created the model profit we have registered as admin perfect and now uh okay this seems to be something else sorry uh yeah now i have created an app which i told you that and then we registered the app inside the installed apps directory as well so we are going in the right direction now i'm at my local host i'll refresh this and you can see that i have my app successfully running now i will go to the admin slash admin so simply we refer to the documentation for the quick illustration of this and the you need to type in the username and password you have set and what you need to do then you can log in here and here you can see i have to do's so you can add a todo here simply we are going to implement the crowd operations so to do number one so a hello world i'll type simply type hello world anything you can give hello world and now i'll save this uh let me i'll either i'll do save and add another or i can save this yeah so this has been saved and here you can see the object says yeah this is i have the object okay so i'm clicking on save again yeah but now when i move to my database i click on this demo have to do and here you can see that you have this data in the json format so perfectly fine so here you can see that i have the data in the json format uh since it's mongodb okay uh i'll quickly show you yeah you can see this in the uh json format so and this is the uh you can also click on this button so this would show you in the tabular form and this will show you in the json form it's perfectly fine so let's implement some few operations on that again now i click to do to do app project and i get to number one edited so i click save so this has been edited so when i move to my database i'll click on refresh i'll click here refresh button yeah now it says doodle number one edited now simply i can add another view so to do number two number two and i'll give the same description yeah and then i can move to my database refresh i'll get another one and now i can delete one so that's makes a last purpose of our project i'll delete this yes i'm sure i'll delete this and i'm gonna move to my database i found it deleted so that's perfectly fine how we implement the create operations so thank you guys thank you so much for joining us in this tutorial so this was the quick purpose you can simply create a doodle app and with the database
