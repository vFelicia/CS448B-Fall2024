00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to teach you about
00:05 - variables so what is a variable or what
00:08 - are
00:09 - variables variables are the placeholder
00:15 - for some data so for example you want to
00:21 - uh hold some value in side some variable
00:26 - how you can do it I will tell you right
00:29 - now so this is our basic uh program
00:33 - which we have written last time and how
00:35 - you can declare a variable for example
00:38 - you want to declare a variable of data
00:41 - type integer so just declare the data
00:46 - type of variable first just write int
00:49 - for declaring
00:50 - integer and then declare the name of the
00:54 - variable so in our case we can name our
00:58 - variable as X for
01:01 - example and then you can just give a
01:06 - semicolon and this is the Declaration of
01:10 - the variable the another way of
01:12 - declaring variable is to initialize the
01:16 - variable with a value
01:20 - so the way you can initialize uh the
01:24 - value or variable with a value is just
01:27 - write the name of the variable and just
01:30 - write equal to and just give some value
01:33 - to it for example 9 and just give semi
01:37 - equal in here or you can uh initialize
01:42 - your variable at the time of Declaration
01:44 - like here at the top
01:47 - just give equal to here and just give
01:51 - the value of the variable so this and
01:58 - this declar varation is same there is no
02:01 - difference so you can either initialize
02:04 - your variable like this or you you can
02:06 - initialize your variable like this okay
02:10 - or you
02:11 - can if you have to uh initialize
02:15 - multiple variable there are is there is
02:19 - there are two ways to um declare those
02:22 - variabl for example I want to declare
02:25 - second variable so I will write
02:28 - int y or Z is equal
02:32 - to
02:34 - 10 and just close it with semic so this
02:38 - is second variable in the second line or
02:42 - you can declare this variable second
02:45 - variable by a comma and just write z
02:51 - equal to 10 so this and this declaration
02:56 - is also same so in this way you can
02:59 - declare variables so if you want to uh
03:03 - declare multiple variable you can just
03:06 - give a comma and
03:08 - declare multiple variables also okay and
03:12 - initialization you can do it like this
03:17 - now there are some basic type of
03:19 - variables there are so many uh types of
03:23 - variable that uh this uh page or this
03:28 - whole page will not not uh be able to uh
03:32 - show all the types of variable you can
03:35 - Define your variables also but the few
03:39 - basic variable I'm going to talk about
03:42 - here so first
03:44 - variable data type is int which is very
03:49 - basic type of variable you can declare
03:53 - care which holds the character so I will
03:58 - name my care variable
04:04 - as CHR for example is equal to it holds
04:09 - a single character right so it just give
04:14 - the single code and then colon and it
04:18 - can hold
04:20 - a or b or c just a single character so
04:25 - this is another type of variable called
04:28 - care and by the name itself it shows
04:30 - that it can hold a character but only a
04:33 - single character it can be one or two it
04:37 - doesn't matter but it just has to be one
04:41 - by
04:42 - okay the SEC third type of variable you
04:47 - can declare is
04:50 - Bool and you can
04:54 - give your name
04:57 - as BL is equal
05:01 - to true
05:05 - or false okay so you can initialize or
05:09 - you can give the value to the W variable
05:12 - as true or false okay so you can just
05:15 - write true here or false here and then
05:18 - it will be initialized or you can give
05:22 - zero or one so zero for false and one
05:27 - for true so you can declare this
05:30 - variable as uh true or false or one or
05:34 - two also okay
05:36 - so true
05:39 - okay now the fourth type of variable
05:44 - there are list of variable you can
05:46 - declare but uh this is also a very
05:50 - important variable data type which is
05:56 - called float and this what will it do is
06:02 - let me declare first it will contain a
06:06 - decimal point values so for example you
06:09 - want to Define
06:11 - 6 32
06:14 - then the float will come handy so what
06:19 - is the difference between integer and
06:21 - Float values integer you can just Define
06:24 - the whole values not points or anything
06:27 - else and the float value will hold the
06:32 - decimal points also
06:34 - okay and there is one more type of
06:38 - variable
06:40 - called
06:41 - double and with this double you can
06:45 - hold even much more decimal values than
06:50 - float so you can say that double is a
06:54 - big brother of this float okay so you
06:58 - can declare
07:00 - if you have a very big value you can
07:02 - hold it in double or if you have a small
07:06 - floating point value then you can use
07:09 - float so these are the some of the basic
07:13 - variables you can declare now I will
07:15 - show you how you can use these variables
07:18 - okay so for example I have these two
07:21 - integer which have some values and for
07:26 - example I want to uh show the sum of
07:29 - these two variable so I will declare a
07:32 - third variable called
07:34 - sum and I will
07:36 - say just semicolon and
07:40 - sum equal
07:42 - to
07:44 - X Plus Zed okay and what this will do is
07:50 - it will see what is the value of x which
07:55 - is 9 and what is the value of Zed which
07:58 - is 10 and and then it will add these two
08:00 - values and place it into a new variable
08:04 - called sum and let's print this value
08:07 - now so I will write C
08:11 - out and then this
08:16 - insertion and then I will
08:20 - say the sum
08:25 - is is and then once more this insertion
08:29 - and then say sum and once
08:35 - more insertion
08:38 - operator and I will end the line so I
08:41 - will
08:42 - say endl okay so what this will print is
08:48 - it will print the sum is and let me add
08:53 - equal to is equal to the sum which is 90
08:57 - 9 + 10 right
08:59 - so let's build our program just build it
09:03 - and I will run it and you can see the
09:06 - sum is 19 here okay you can change the
09:11 - value here for example
09:15 - 56 576 or some value here and build it
09:22 - and run the program and it will show the
09:25 - sum in the same way if you want to sub
09:29 - ract the values you can
09:37 - say
09:39 - subtract is equal to but you need
09:41 - to declare it with a data type and you
09:47 - can say x minus
09:52 - Z okay so this will hold the subtraction
09:55 - of x minus y so this will minus X which
09:59 - is
10:01 - 4847 minus
10:03 - 576 and once again if you want
10:07 - to so the show the subtraction we can
10:11 - say
10:17 - the subtraction
10:20 - substraction
10:22 - is just copy this variable and place it
10:27 - here and I think the spelling is wrong
10:31 - here but who gues just build your
10:34 - program and run the program and now you
10:37 - can see the sum and the subtraction of
10:42 - your X and
10:44 - Y so in this way you can use variable to
10:48 - hold the values right so variables are
10:54 - very basic concepts in C++ and you need
10:58 - to know what are variable in order to
11:01 - learn further in C++ so I hope you have
11:06 - understood this B basic concept of C++ I
11:11 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
11:13 - write comment and subscribe and bye for
11:15 - now

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to teach you about variables so what is a variable or what are variables variables are the placeholder for some data so for example you want to uh hold some value in side some variable how you can do it I will tell you right now so this is our basic uh program which we have written last time and how you can declare a variable for example you want to declare a variable of data type integer so just declare the data type of variable first just write int for declaring integer and then declare the name of the variable so in our case we can name our variable as X for example and then you can just give a semicolon and this is the Declaration of the variable the another way of declaring variable is to initialize the variable with a value so the way you can initialize uh the value or variable with a value is just write the name of the variable and just write equal to and just give some value to it for example 9 and just give semi equal in here or you can uh initialize your variable at the time of Declaration like here at the top just give equal to here and just give the value of the variable so this and this declar varation is same there is no difference so you can either initialize your variable like this or you you can initialize your variable like this okay or you can if you have to uh initialize multiple variable there are is there is there are two ways to um declare those variabl for example I want to declare second variable so I will write int y or Z is equal to 10 and just close it with semic so this is second variable in the second line or you can declare this variable second variable by a comma and just write z equal to 10 so this and this declaration is also same so in this way you can declare variables so if you want to uh declare multiple variable you can just give a comma and declare multiple variables also okay and initialization you can do it like this now there are some basic type of variables there are so many uh types of variable that uh this uh page or this whole page will not not uh be able to uh show all the types of variable you can Define your variables also but the few basic variable I'm going to talk about here so first variable data type is int which is very basic type of variable you can declare care which holds the character so I will name my care variable as CHR for example is equal to it holds a single character right so it just give the single code and then colon and it can hold a or b or c just a single character so this is another type of variable called care and by the name itself it shows that it can hold a character but only a single character it can be one or two it doesn't matter but it just has to be one by okay the SEC third type of variable you can declare is Bool and you can give your name as BL is equal to true or false okay so you can initialize or you can give the value to the W variable as true or false okay so you can just write true here or false here and then it will be initialized or you can give zero or one so zero for false and one for true so you can declare this variable as uh true or false or one or two also okay so true okay now the fourth type of variable there are list of variable you can declare but uh this is also a very important variable data type which is called float and this what will it do is let me declare first it will contain a decimal point values so for example you want to Define 6 32 then the float will come handy so what is the difference between integer and Float values integer you can just Define the whole values not points or anything else and the float value will hold the decimal points also okay and there is one more type of variable called double and with this double you can hold even much more decimal values than float so you can say that double is a big brother of this float okay so you can declare if you have a very big value you can hold it in double or if you have a small floating point value then you can use float so these are the some of the basic variables you can declare now I will show you how you can use these variables okay so for example I have these two integer which have some values and for example I want to uh show the sum of these two variable so I will declare a third variable called sum and I will say just semicolon and sum equal to X Plus Zed okay and what this will do is it will see what is the value of x which is 9 and what is the value of Zed which is 10 and and then it will add these two values and place it into a new variable called sum and let's print this value now so I will write C out and then this insertion and then I will say the sum is is and then once more this insertion and then say sum and once more insertion operator and I will end the line so I will say endl okay so what this will print is it will print the sum is and let me add equal to is equal to the sum which is 90 9 + 10 right so let's build our program just build it and I will run it and you can see the sum is 19 here okay you can change the value here for example 56 576 or some value here and build it and run the program and it will show the sum in the same way if you want to sub ract the values you can say subtract is equal to but you need to declare it with a data type and you can say x minus Z okay so this will hold the subtraction of x minus y so this will minus X which is 4847 minus 576 and once again if you want to so the show the subtraction we can say the subtraction substraction is just copy this variable and place it here and I think the spelling is wrong here but who gues just build your program and run the program and now you can see the sum and the subtraction of your X and Y so in this way you can use variable to hold the values right so variables are very basic concepts in C++ and you need to know what are variable in order to learn further in C++ so I hope you have understood this B basic concept of C++ I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
