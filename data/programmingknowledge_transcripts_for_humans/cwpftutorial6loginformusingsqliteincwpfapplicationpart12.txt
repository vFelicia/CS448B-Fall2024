00:08 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:10 - last video I have shown you how to
00:12 - download and
00:14 - install the new dll files for connecting
00:18 - esite with your wpfc
00:20 - application earlier in the video number
00:24 - second and no third and fourth video
00:28 - number third and fourth I have shown you
00:29 - how how to connect your database using
00:32 - finish uh. esite library but uh in the
00:38 - last video I shown you how to download
00:40 - and install this new library called
00:43 - system.
00:45 - datalite Library which we are going to
00:48 - use because it's much flexible than
00:53 - finisher do escolite
00:56 - library so in the last video I've shown
00:58 - you how to install all that new library
01:02 - so if you don't
01:03 - know uh and if you haven't seen this
01:08 - last video and you are just have just
01:10 - seen the third and fourth video then I'm
01:15 - not using those Library finisher
01:18 - libraries I'm using the these
01:23 - escolite new library which is called
01:25 - system. dat. esite dll files
01:30 - now in this video I will show you how to
01:32 - create a login page but before that if
01:36 - you have done installing
01:40 - these system. data. esite you need to
01:43 - change some settings in your projects so
01:49 - what setting you need to change I will
01:51 - show you first so just right click your
01:56 - project and click this property
02:01 - here and in here you need to
02:04 - change these
02:06 - properties
02:08 - so go to Target framework and instead of
02:12 - using NET Framework for client profile
02:16 - we are going to use NET Framework
02:20 - 4 from here it will give a warning just
02:25 - say
02:27 - Yes And once you
02:31 - have clicked yes it will generate this
02:35 - app.config
02:37 - file so when you do the
02:40 - [Music]
02:42 - settings NET Framework 4 then it will
02:45 - create this app.config file
02:48 - automatically and it will disappear your
02:52 - older opened file so once again you can
02:55 - open those files from
02:57 - here and this
03:00 - app.config is a new file so just open
03:03 - this file from here and what we are
03:07 - going to do here
03:12 - is instead of this code which is a
03:16 - startup code in this app.config file I
03:19 - will just make it bigger so you can see
03:21 - it better
03:23 - so this app.config file contains this
03:27 - startup code for this framework NET
03:31 - Framework 4 version 4 so just instead of
03:37 - this startup code here which is in
03:41 - between this startup tags here and here
03:46 - just remove this code from here so I
03:50 - remove that code and in this
03:53 - configuration tag in between I will add
03:57 - a new startup code which is like this
04:01 - so if you want just pause the video and
04:05 - copy this code I have written this
04:08 - startup start and end code and here I
04:12 - have given this line called use Legacy
04:16 - V2
04:18 - runtime activation policy is equal to
04:21 - true in the double
04:24 - quotes and in this startup code tag I I
04:29 - have given a tag called supported
04:33 - runtime version is equal to
04:37 - v4.0 in the double
04:39 - tag so if you want just pause the video
04:43 - and just
04:44 - copy this code here in the app.config
04:49 - file once you have done that you are now
04:54 - ready to write your login page
04:58 - code
05:00 - so I think by now you are familiar with
05:05 - the esite database how to create this
05:08 - escolite database and if you don't know
05:12 - how to create this esite database you
05:16 - can just uh go to my site database
05:20 - tutorial I have this in my playlist just
05:23 - search for them and you can see that and
05:27 - you can can create your own data datase
05:30 - so what I have done is I have created a
05:34 - database which is called database.
05:38 - DB here and I'm opening this database in
05:42 - my escolite manager which is a plug-in
05:45 - from
05:46 - Firefox and I have created a table in
05:49 - this database. DB called employee
05:54 - info and I have create given 1 2 3 4 5 6
06:00 - columns in this database first is Eid
06:05 - which is employee ID second is name
06:09 - third column is surname fourth column is
06:11 - age fifth is username and sixth is for
06:17 - password so this username and password
06:20 - we are going to
06:22 - use for making our login
06:28 - page so so I have done this
06:31 - simple uh database and I have created
06:34 - this simple employee table with these
06:38 - six
06:39 - columns and now we are going to use this
06:44 - database.
06:45 - dbnr
06:48 - file so now what I will do
06:53 - is I will go to my WPF
06:57 - application and
07:01 - I will
07:03 - take two text boxes from here
07:07 - so text box
07:11 - one and text box
07:16 - two and I will just make it a little bit
07:19 - smaller so I can give a label also so I
07:24 - will take two labels from here
07:28 - also
07:30 - label
07:32 - one and label
07:36 - two and this label I will change it
07:42 - as usern
07:45 - name and second name I will change it
07:51 - as
07:54 - password and this
07:58 - first text text box name I will give it
08:02 - as
08:04 - user
08:06 - name and second text box I will name it
08:13 - as
08:15 - password
08:17 - okay or I will just name it as
08:22 - txt underscore password so it will be
08:26 - more appropriate for the text box here
08:29 - also txt
08:32 - uncor
08:34 - username
08:36 - okay now I will double click this button
08:40 - and in
08:42 - here first of all let's change this
08:45 - button caption
08:47 - also instead of using this test name
08:53 - I'm changing it as
08:58 - login
08:59 - now it's looking better and now I will d
09:04 - double click this login button here and
09:07 - we are
09:08 - just having no code here in the last
09:12 - video I have just added this using
09:15 - system. dat.
09:18 - site for connecting my site library with
09:24 - this WPF
09:26 - application so in here in this code you
09:30 - need to declare your
09:31 - database location
09:35 - first so just below your this public
09:42 - partial class which is your
09:44 - main window partial class just go below
09:49 - there and write this code I will just
09:51 - make it bigger so it will be
09:56 - visible Okay so so declare this first
10:02 - write string and give it a string
10:06 - variable name in my case DB connection
10:09 - string is equal to write this at the
10:12 - rate sign and then give double clotes
10:16 - and inside this double code write data
10:19 - Das source is equal to your database
10:23 - name because my database is in my debug
10:27 - folder of my project object that's why
10:30 - I'm not providing any
10:33 - path if it is outside your debug folder
10:39 - or whe wherever your this exe file is
10:44 - there then you what you can do is just
10:47 - right
10:48 - click and just go to security and just
10:52 - copy this
10:53 - path and you can just paste it here and
10:58 - when it show error just give these
11:00 - double slashes here so because it's in
11:04 - my debug folder I don't need to give the
11:07 - this long
11:14 - path
