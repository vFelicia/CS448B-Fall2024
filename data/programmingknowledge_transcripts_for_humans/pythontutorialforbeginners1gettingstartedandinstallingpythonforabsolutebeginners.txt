00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video
00:02 - tutorial on Python programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:06 - give you a introduction to Python and
00:10 - how you can download and install python
00:12 - on your Windows operating system so
00:15 - let's get started so python is widely
00:19 - used general purpose high level language
00:23 - and it's design philosophy emphasizes
00:26 - code
00:27 - readability and it's uh since allows
00:30 - programmers to express Concept in fewer
00:34 - lines of code than would be possible in
00:38 - language such as C so let me give you a
00:43 - little overview of python first so
00:48 - python is a scripting
00:51 - language and it includes objectoriented
00:55 - uh Concepts also and it's a portable and
00:58 - very powerful language language and it's
01:02 - often called a programming language for
01:06 - beginners because it's really easy to
01:08 - Learn Python and it's really easy to
01:12 - implement if you have little codes or a
01:15 - little concept that you want to
01:17 - implement very fast you can use Python
01:20 - to implement them and it has mixed
01:23 - features like uh programming languages
01:26 - like Java and pearl script
01:30 - beams and what are the uses of python uh
01:35 - it can be used to make system utility
01:39 - that can be used to make guies guis
01:43 - stands for uh graphical user interface
01:47 - and there are some idees which you can
01:50 - use or which there are some platform
01:52 - which you can use uh to create GUI
01:56 - so this these are some of the um
02:00 - platform on which you can make GUI
02:03 - application for example QT uh platform
02:08 - or Windows platform or gtk platform you
02:11 - can make interactive guies using python
02:16 - you can also uh use Python to make
02:20 - internet scripting uh as a internet
02:24 - scripting language and you can also use
02:27 - python as a embedded scripting language
02:30 - even you can use python as a database
02:33 - programming language artificial
02:36 - intelligence and image processing so
02:39 - there are widely used uh you know
02:43 - implementations of python and you can
02:45 - use python in many uh you know many
02:49 - fields so it's very good idea to Learn
02:53 - Python and it's really easy to uh Learn
02:56 - Python that's why you can uh you know
02:59 - you know Learn Python uh if you are a
03:02 - beginner in programming okay so let's uh
03:07 - see how we can install python on our
03:10 - Windows operating system so just open
03:13 - your favorite uh browser and search for
03:17 - Python and the first link here you will
03:19 - find is uh
03:23 - www.python.org
03:24 - this is the official website of python
03:28 - just click here
03:31 - and in here you will be able to see uh
03:34 - the overview of python by
03:37 - browsing uh these tabs but the tab we
03:42 - are interested in right now is this
03:44 - download
03:46 - tab and in here there are two versions
03:50 - one is the very latest version and one
03:53 - was uh little bit slightly older version
03:57 - but very stable version also what we we
03:59 - are going to do is we are going to
04:01 - download this latest version so I'm
04:05 - going to just click this download button
04:07 - and it'll download this python 3.4.1 at
04:13 - the time of making this video this is
04:15 - the latest version uh and once this um
04:20 - download is complete we will be able to
04:22 - install python on our system so now
04:26 - download is complete I will just run
04:28 - this
04:32 - and it's preparing to install
04:36 - and this is the first option or first
04:39 - wizard python set of wizard you will be
04:42 - able to see and for now I just want to
04:46 - uh use install for all users and I will
04:49 - click
04:50 - next and in here there is the default
04:54 - location where python will be installed
04:57 - and this is the name of the folder
04:58 - because it's three uh version 3.4 so the
05:02 - folder name will be python 34 okay just
05:06 - click
05:07 - next and
05:10 - then uh these are all the utilities
05:13 - which will be
05:15 - installed uh if you want to customize
05:17 - you can customize it but I will leave
05:19 - them as default and I will click
05:23 - next and this installation will start
05:27 - and it's saying that it will take
05:28 - several minutes to install python so you
05:31 - need to wait until it's uh process is
05:34 - going on and once the process
05:38 - completes I will uh go through the next
05:41 - steps so let's wait for some time and I
05:44 - will pause the video for
05:46 - now so while this process is going on I
05:50 - will give you brief uh uh of compilation
05:56 - and uh how this Python language uh
06:00 - interprets or compile itself okay
06:05 - so if you have learned any other
06:08 - languages like C C++ or Java uh you know
06:13 - that this language is a compile you know
06:18 - first you need to compile this uh file
06:22 - like Java or some other uh program and
06:25 - then once you compile your program it
06:28 - will uh produce use a executable file
06:32 - and then you can run this executable
06:34 - file and you will be able to see this
06:35 - kind kind of a result but python is a
06:40 - interpreted language that means you
06:44 - don't need to compile your Python
06:48 - program because it's a interpreted
06:50 - language it'll directly you or you will
06:54 - be able to run directly your program and
06:56 - it is a runtime compilation it will do
07:00 - so if if any error
07:02 - occurs you will be able to uh see them
07:05 - only at run time okay so there is no
07:09 - need to compile or there is no feature
07:12 - to compile uh your code in Python it
07:16 - will just execute your program
07:19 - directly so this is the little
07:21 - difference between the programming
07:24 - languages like Java C or
07:27 - C++ uh that in those languages you need
07:32 - to compile your program but in Python
07:35 - instead it's a interpreted language so
07:38 - you don't need to compile this it will
07:41 - be uh executed at
07:43 - runtime okay
07:47 - now our uh installation is finished so I
07:50 - will just click
07:55 - finish now once your installation is
07:57 - complete you will be able to go go to
07:59 - your start menu here and you will be
08:02 - able to see python in these options
08:06 - otherwise you can go to all programs and
08:10 - in here you will be able to see Python
08:13 - and whatever version you have downloaded
08:15 - for python so I can see this folder
08:18 - called python do python space 3.4 which
08:21 - is a version for python I have installed
08:24 - and when I click this folder I can see
08:27 - uh few uh files here so there is
08:32 - something called python command
08:35 - line and I will click this first python
08:38 - command line first and this is a command
08:41 - line uh Tool uh which you can use to
08:45 - execute your python uh scripting
08:47 - language or python programs right so for
08:51 - example I want to execute something here
08:55 - uh what I can do I can just print
08:58 - something something so I will write
09:03 - print and in the
09:05 - brackets in the earlier version before
09:07 - three uh or uh before version three uh
09:11 - you don't need to give these uh brackets
09:14 - to execute your uh message but after
09:18 - version three you need to use these uh
09:21 - brackets in order to uh uh print your
09:24 - message like uh using print function so
09:27 - print is a buil-in function to print
09:30 - your uh string or whatever you uh write
09:34 - in these brackets so I will just use
09:37 - double quotes and I will write
09:42 - hello hello world and when I press enter
09:46 - it will give me hello world right so
09:50 - there are something you will notice when
09:53 - I have printed hello world
09:55 - that first you don't need any semicolon
10:00 - or any ending uh uh ending um
10:04 - declaration in Python so if you have or
10:08 - if you are used to some uh languages
10:10 - like C C++ or Java you know uh that you
10:15 - need to end your line uh using
10:18 - semicolons right but in in your Python
10:23 - program you don't need to use semicolons
10:26 - here and the other thing I have already
10:29 - told you that you don't need to uh
10:32 - compile your program you just hit enter
10:35 - and it will run your program
10:37 - right so this is a command line tool the
10:43 - same functionality you can
10:47 - use a GUI tool also uh to write the
10:50 - program so if you uh want to develop
10:54 - your uh program using command line you
10:57 - can use this python command line I will
10:59 - just close it for now and I can even use
11:03 - or python even provides a GUI which is
11:07 - called
11:08 - idle to program uh python so I will just
11:13 - go to this folder once again and I will
11:16 - click this idle python
11:19 - GUI and it will open the same shell
11:23 - command but it's more interactive and
11:27 - you will be able to see the same
11:30 - uh same uh command line structure here
11:35 - now for starting because I think these
11:39 - fonts are a little bit smaller so I can
11:42 - make them bigger by going into the
11:46 - option configure idle and in here I can
11:49 - change the font size of uh my
11:54 - shell right so for example I want to
11:58 - increase it to 16 so that I can see
12:03 - better and you can also see better let's
12:07 - make it um 18 even so you will be able
12:10 - to see more
12:12 - better okay so once this is
12:15 - done uh in here also you can just write
12:20 - [Music]
12:22 - print and in the brackets you can just
12:25 - give your message for
12:27 - example
12:30 - hello world and whenever I have uh or
12:35 - when I write this you will be able to
12:37 - see different colors for different uh
12:41 - you know structure so because print is a
12:44 - function it will be uh highlighted in
12:47 - different color and hello world is a
12:50 - string so it will be uh highlighted in
12:53 - green color for example so this uh in
12:56 - this way you can read the program uh in
12:59 - a better way and this is why we
13:03 - generally use this python GOI or which
13:06 - is called idle to program okay and I
13:10 - press enter and it gives me once again
13:13 - the result hello world
13:17 - right now I think this that's it for
13:20 - this video in the next video I'm going
13:22 - to show you how to uh use other features
13:26 - of python so stay tuned and please wait
13:29 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the first video tutorial on Python programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to give you a introduction to Python and how you can download and install python on your

you can use python in many uh you know many fields so it's very good idea to Learn Python and it's really easy to uh Learn Python that's why you can uh you know you know Learn Python uh if you are a beginner in programming okay so let's uh see how we can install python on our Windows operating system so just open your favorite uh browser and search for Python and the first link here you will find is uh www.python.org this is the official website of python just click here and in here you will be able to see uh the overview of python by browsing uh these tabs but the tab we are interested in right now is this download tab and in here there are two versions one is the very latest version and one was uh little bit slightly older version but very stable version also what we we are going to do is we are going to download this latest version so I'm going to just click this download button and it'll download this python 3.4.1 at the time of making this video this is the latest version uh and once this um download is complete we will be able to install python on our system so now download is complete I will just run this and it's preparing to install and this is the first option or first wizard python set of wizard you will be able to see and for now I just want to uh use install for all users and I will click next and in here there is the default location where python will be installed and this is the name of the folder because it's three uh version 3.4 so the folder name will be python 34 okay just click next and then uh these are all the utilities which will be installed uh if you want to customize you can customize it but I will leave them as default and I will click next and this installation will start and it's saying that it will take several minutes to install python so you need to wait until it's uh process is going on and once the process completes I will uh go through the next steps so let's wait for some time and I will pause the video for now so while this process is going on I will give you brief uh uh of compilation and uh how this Python language uh interprets or compile itself okay so if you have learned any other languages like C C++ or Java
