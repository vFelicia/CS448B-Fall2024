00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use switch cases in
00:05 - C as we have seen if statement switch
00:09 - statement is also a conditional
00:12 - statement so if any condition is true
00:16 - the code related to that condition will
00:19 - be executed so let's see how we can use
00:22 - switch cases for the starting code what
00:26 - uh I'm doing is I'm making this code for
00:30 - the students who got some
00:33 - marks and on the basis of marks got by
00:37 - student I want to show some messages so
00:41 - what I'm doing is I'm just printing on
00:43 - the screen please enter the student
00:47 - marks and then what I'm doing is I'm
00:50 - taking the input from the user and I'm
00:53 - converting it to the int value by this
00:56 - int. pass and I'm saving it in into this
01:00 - variable called marks now on the basis
01:03 - of user entered marks I want to show
01:06 - some
01:07 - messages so let's see how we can use
01:10 - switch State switch statement to perform
01:14 - our task the switch statement starts
01:17 - from the keyword
01:19 - switch and with this bracket and in this
01:22 - bracket your condition comes now in our
01:26 - case our condition is marks on the basis
01:30 - of marks we are going to print messages
01:33 - right now after
01:37 - this brackets you need to give these two
01:40 - curly braet brackets to open and close
01:43 - switch case statement and inside these
01:47 - curly braces we write the
01:50 - cases which can be possible so for
01:54 - example
01:58 - case 90 if student get 90 marks then I
02:04 - want
02:05 - to write on the
02:08 - screen on Console
02:13 - do
02:17 - right and I will print this message on
02:20 - the screen
02:32 - excellent okay
02:37 - now after every switch case we can use a
02:41 - optional break so I'll
02:45 - right break
02:47 - here so this break what this break does
02:51 - is it whenever some condition is true
02:55 - then this code is performed and it
02:57 - breaks out of the switch statement and
03:01 - it goes directly here and it performs
03:03 - the other code which is written after
03:05 - this switch
03:06 - statement okay so in this way I will
03:09 - just copy this switch statement and
03:14 - paste it three more times and if the
03:17 - student gets for
03:19 - [Music]
03:20 - example 60 marks I will
03:26 - say
03:28 - very good
03:31 - and if the student
03:33 - gets 30
03:36 - marks then I can write
03:42 - need Improvement okay
03:47 - so if the student will get the 90 marks
03:50 - I will uh just show this ex excellent
03:54 - message if the student gets 60 marks I
03:58 - will show very good and if the student
04:00 - gets 30 marks I will show need
04:03 - Improvement and what this break does is
04:07 - if the condition is true it immediately
04:09 - print this message and it will break the
04:13 - switch cases so break we can use to go
04:17 - out of these switch cases now for
04:21 - example the user has entered some values
04:26 - which is not 90 60 or 30 then for
04:32 - dealing with such cases we use
04:39 - default
04:40 - default and what this default does is it
04:45 - catches all the exception or all the
04:49 - values which are not in these condition
04:52 - which are not provided in these cases
04:55 - okay so this is the default case for us
04:59 - and in the default
05:02 - case I will just write for example I
05:06 - will just copy this paste it here and in
05:09 - the default case I will
05:13 - say
05:16 - please
05:17 - enter
05:19 - valid value
05:22 - okay so in the default case this is the
05:26 - default case and in in this default case
05:29 - what
05:30 - whatever which is not in this Cas is
05:34 - whatever condition which is not followed
05:37 - in this case or this case or this case
05:39 - or any other case will fall into this
05:42 - default okay so now let's try and run
05:46 - the
05:47 - code and I will enter the students marks
05:51 - for example 90 and press enter it shows
05:55 - me the message excellent right but for
05:59 - example I will
06:02 - enter the marks
06:04 - 60 it shows me very
06:07 - good and as in the same way when I will
06:11 - enter 30 it will give me need
06:13 - Improvement but let's
06:16 - see what happens when we enter some
06:20 - value which is not belonging to these
06:22 - cases for example
06:23 - 75 and it says please enter the valid
06:27 - values okay so any value which is not 90
06:32 - 60 or 30 or whatever you enter in this
06:36 - cases uh will not be followed and it
06:40 - will directly go into this default case
06:44 - and this message will be
06:46 - printed and in here in a similar way you
06:49 - can write some function or you can call
06:52 - some some functions you can perform some
06:55 - calculation some some code you can write
06:58 - so it's not necessary that you should
07:00 - only print the value you can perform
07:02 - some calculation you can do some maths
07:05 - you can call some functions so anything
07:08 - which you would like you can do it
07:10 - inside this switch
07:13 - cases now for
07:16 - example if you don't want to use break
07:20 - it's also okay but what will happen then
07:26 - is it will not break here your program
07:29 - will not break here but wherever it sees
07:33 - or your your switch case sees the first
07:36 - break and whenever the condition is true
07:38 - it will show this message so for example
07:42 - I will just
07:44 - remove this break and this message and
07:47 - this break and this message then what do
07:50 - you think what will happen in this case
07:54 - because we don't have provided the break
07:57 - and when you enter 90 it will directly
08:00 - show this message which
08:03 - is need Improvement because it doesn't
08:07 - see break here it doesn't see break here
08:10 - and it will see that first break comes
08:13 - here then it will just show need
08:16 - Improvement so this is a small thing
08:21 - which happens in switch statement if it
08:24 - doesn't sees break point it goes to the
08:27 - next case now for example I want to
08:31 - print the same message I can write like
08:39 - this whatever is the
08:44 - marks
08:47 - okay so
08:49 - now I can write
08:54 - marks entered and when I run the program
08:58 - and for for example I will enter
09:01 - 90 it says marks entered 90 which is
09:06 - this message
09:08 - right because it jumps to the next Cas
09:12 - 60 and it sees here is no break it jumps
09:15 - to 30 and it sees yes here is a break so
09:20 - I need to print this right so switch
09:24 - case works like this it goes to the next
09:27 - case if the break is not pro
09:30 - ided so in this way you can use switch
09:34 - cases in cop I hope you have enjoyed

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use switch cases in C as we have seen if statement switch statement is also a conditional statement so if any condition is true the code related to that condition will be executed so let's see how we can use switch cases for the starting code what uh I'm doing is I'm making this code for the students who got some marks and on the basis of marks got by student I want to show some messages so what I'm doing is I'm just printing on the screen please enter the student marks and then what I'm doing is I'm taking the input from the user and I'm converting it to the int value by this int. pass and I'm saving it in into this variable called marks now on the basis of user entered marks I want to show some messages so let's see how we can use switch State switch statement to perform our task the switch statement starts from the keyword switch and with this bracket and in this bracket your condition comes now in our case our condition is marks on the basis of marks we are going to print messages right now after this brackets you need to give these two curly braet brackets to open and close switch case statement and inside these curly braces we write the cases which can be possible so for example case 90 if student get 90 marks then I want to write on the screen on Console do right and I will print this message on the screen excellent okay now after every switch case we can use a optional break so I'll right break here so this break what this break does is it whenever some condition is true then this code is performed and it breaks out of the switch statement and it goes directly here and it performs the other code which is written after this switch statement okay so in this way I will just copy this switch statement and paste it three more times and if the student gets for example 60 marks I will say very good and if the student gets 30 marks then I can write need Improvement okay so if the student will get the 90 marks I will uh just show this ex excellent message if the student gets 60 marks I will show very good and if the student gets 30 marks I will show need Improvement and what this break does is if the condition is true it immediately print this message and it will break the switch cases so break we can use to go out of these switch cases now for example the user has entered some values which is not 90 60 or 30 then for dealing with such cases we use default default and what this default does is it catches all the exception or all the values which are not in these condition which are not provided in these cases okay so this is the default case for us and in the default case I will just write for example I will just copy this paste it here and in the default case I will say please enter valid value okay so in the default case this is the default case and in in this default case what whatever which is not in this Cas is whatever condition which is not followed in this case or this case or this case or any other case will fall into this default okay so now let's try and run the code and I will enter the students marks for example 90 and press enter it shows me the message excellent right but for example I will enter the marks 60 it shows me very good and as in the same way when I will enter 30 it will give me need Improvement but let's see what happens when we enter some value which is not belonging to these cases for example 75 and it says please enter the valid values okay so any value which is not 90 60 or 30 or whatever you enter in this cases uh will not be followed and it will directly go into this default case and this message will be printed and in here in a similar way you can write some function or you can call some some functions you can perform some calculation some some code you can write so it's not necessary that you should only print the value you can perform some calculation you can do some maths you can call some functions so anything which you would like you can do it inside this switch cases now for example if you don't want to use break it's also okay but what will happen then is it will not break here your program will not break here but wherever it sees or your your switch case sees the first break and whenever the condition is true it will show this message so for example I will just remove this break and this message and this break and this message then what do you think what will happen in this case because we don't have provided the break and when you enter 90 it will directly show this message which is need Improvement because it doesn't see break here it doesn't see break here and it will see that first break comes here then it will just show need Improvement so this is a small thing which happens in switch statement if it doesn't sees break point it goes to the next case now for example I want to print the same message I can write like this whatever is the marks okay so now I can write marks entered and when I run the program and for for example I will enter 90 it says marks entered 90 which is this message right because it jumps to the next Cas 60 and it sees here is no break it jumps to 30 and it sees yes here is a break so I need to print this right so switch case works like this it goes to the next case if the break is not pro ided so in this way you can use switch cases in cop I
