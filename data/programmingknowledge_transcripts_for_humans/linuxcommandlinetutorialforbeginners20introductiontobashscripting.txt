00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - we can create a script in uh Linux and
00:10 - uh we will also see how we can execute
00:12 - our script and we will learn how we can
00:15 - write for example our first hello world
00:18 - script now scripting in general is
00:21 - really uh you know deep concept and uh I
00:25 - can make a separate tutorial about
00:28 - scripting itself right so in this uh
00:31 - video I just want to give you the brief
00:33 - introduction about scripting and how you
00:35 - can use scripting so that you can uh
00:38 - build on that knowledge and you can you
00:40 - know learn about scripting in different
00:43 - video or different uh you know so from
00:46 - the different Source right so first of
00:48 - all what is a script a script is a text
00:52 - file that contains a sequence of command
00:55 - for a Linux based operating system so
00:59 - let's see how we can create a script so
01:01 - I'm going to open our terminal first of
01:03 - all and in this terminal first of all
01:06 - let's say we want to create a script on
01:08 - the desktop so I will just change the
01:11 - directory to the desktop and then I will
01:14 - use our Nano editor for creating a
01:18 - script so for creating a script you just
01:21 - need to write Nano and then the script
01:24 - name so for example I will name my
01:26 - script as uh my script itself now it's
01:31 - enough to give this uh name uh my script
01:36 - here but it's a good practice to give an
01:39 - extension of sh here for uh you know
01:43 - just showing the user that it's a script
01:46 - okay so I'm just adding the extension
01:49 - here but if you don't add this extension
01:52 - it'll work fine so it's uh not going to
01:55 - be different if you don't add this
01:57 - extension now first of all uh we need to
02:00 - know where our bash is located on our
02:05 - system so what I'm going to do is before
02:08 - creating a file or uh let's just create
02:10 - a file and then uh we are going to uh
02:13 - see further so Nano and then the name of
02:16 - the script and press enter and it's
02:18 - going to open this uh kind of Editor to
02:22 - you right now first uh line which you
02:26 - write in a script is this uh line which
02:31 - you need to use or it's a good practice
02:33 - uh to use this so first is you need to
02:36 - write hash and then this exclamation
02:39 - mark which is called hashbang and then
02:42 - the location of your bash now what I'm
02:46 - going to do is I'm going to open a
02:49 - different terminal and then we will see
02:52 - the location of our bash uh where is our
02:55 - bash right now what we are going to do
02:59 - is just just to which and then just
03:03 - write bash here okay and then press
03:07 - enter and it gives this answer so this
03:10 - witch command we are going to learn
03:11 - later what is this witch command and
03:13 - what it does is but just open a new
03:16 - terminal and just write which bash and
03:19 - it's going to give you the location
03:21 - where bash is located so this is the
03:23 - location so just uh take this location
03:27 - and after this hashbang which we have
03:30 - written here you need to write this
03:32 - location so forward slash bin slash bash
03:39 - okay which is this location here okay so
03:42 - we just uh needed to know the location
03:45 - and whatever the location is you just
03:47 - need to write here after this hashbang
03:50 - okay and now you can close the other
03:53 - terminal so this tells uh the you know
03:57 - interpreter that uh this is a SC script
03:59 - which is using bash and then as I have
04:03 - told you the script is a sequence of
04:07 - commands so for example I can uh
04:10 - normally write LS for listing for
04:12 - example let's do long listing with this
04:15 - script first of all right so just
04:18 - hashbang and then the long listing which
04:21 - is which you write on the terminal it
04:23 - will list out the you know files or
04:26 - directory on your terminal right now in
04:29 - in order to save it you just need to
04:31 - writ uh crl o and press enter which will
04:34 - save it and then crol X to exit so you
04:38 - can see here our script is created now
04:42 - in order to execute a script first of
04:45 - all let's see when we execute it what
04:47 - happens so normally you need to give the
04:51 - permission execute permission to your
04:53 - script but if you do it without giving
04:56 - the permission let's see what happens so
04:59 - to execute a script you just need to
05:01 - write dot for Slash and then the name of
05:03 - your script something like uh this so my
05:07 - script right so just write my script
05:11 - here Dosh okay and then when you execute
05:15 - it it says permission denied because
05:20 - your script doesn't have the execute
05:23 - permission when you create it okay so in
05:26 - order to give the execute permission you
05:28 - need to just give the execute permission
05:30 - to it so you can just write um CH mod
05:34 - plus X for uh giving the execute
05:37 - permission to user group and uh the
05:39 - others and then your script name for
05:42 - example okay and then press enter and
05:45 - now your script has the execute
05:48 - permission right so in the last three
05:50 - video we have been learning how to give
05:52 - the permission to the script and that's
05:54 - why I'm I was uh you know creating those
05:57 - video to uh you know let you know how
06:00 - you can change the permission of a file
06:02 - now this will change the permission of a
06:04 - file to the execute so you can uh
06:07 - execute uh this script by giving this
06:10 - permission now once again when we do uh
06:13 - dot forward slash and then the script
06:16 - name and press enter what it does is
06:19 - it's going to list out the long listing
06:22 - of your desktop right so you can see let
06:26 - me just make it a little bit bigger and
06:28 - once again executed again and you can
06:31 - see it has done the long listing of uh
06:34 - on the desktop so you can see we have
06:37 - three files on the desktop and each have
06:40 - their own permission so first is the
06:43 - directory other is the file. text and
06:47 - third one is the myscript dosh which
06:50 - have all the execute permission
06:53 - here okay so this is a simple for
06:58 - example hello full script you can write
07:01 - Let's uh modify our script and let's see
07:04 - what else we can do so single command we
07:06 - can um you know you can ask why we need
07:10 - script for executing a single command so
07:13 - let's go to the script again so I will
07:16 - just write Nano and then my script and
07:21 - this is a very basic example I have
07:23 - given you but with this uh scripting you
07:26 - can execute a you know see sequence of
07:29 - command not only one command but for
07:32 - example let's do for example I will do
07:35 - LS and then I'll will Echo something and
07:39 - let's
07:40 - Echo
07:42 - hello world here okay and then I will
07:46 - just save it crl o and press enter and
07:49 - then crl X and once again when I execute
07:52 - this script it first of all list out uh
07:56 - the contents of the directory and then
07:58 - it print prints the hello world which is
08:01 - using the echo Command right I have
08:04 - shown you in the Echo command tutorial
08:07 - that we can also create a variable in U
08:12 - you know for using it in the Echo so for
08:16 - example I will create a variable let's
08:19 - say it's called Uh string is equal to
08:23 - and I will assign something to it let's
08:26 - say hello world itself
08:30 - something like
08:32 - this okay and uh with Echo you can uh
08:36 - just call this variable by using this
08:40 - dollar symbol so just
08:42 - write something like this okay so string
08:47 - and using uh the dollar symbol before
08:49 - the variable name you can Echo it okay
08:52 - so I will just save it and press enter
08:56 - execute uh I will exit it and then once
08:59 - again again execute the command and it's
09:01 - doing the same so you can see here in
09:06 - this script we are performing the you
09:08 - know series of command and this is what
09:11 - scripting is so you can write uh you
09:15 - know sequence of uh you know command
09:17 - here and execute it and scripting is
09:20 - much advanced than this so it has a
09:22 - functions and it has loops and if
09:25 - conditions so um you know it's a
09:28 - different topic to learn scripting but I
09:31 - wanted to know uh let you know that this
09:34 - kind of scripting exists so you can
09:36 - build on this knowledge and learn about
09:38 - scripting because it's really uh you
09:41 - know important if you uh want to pursue
09:45 - your uh career in Linux for example
09:49 - right so I hope you have enjoyed this
09:51 - video please rate comment subscribe and
09:53 - bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can create a script in uh Linux and uh we will also see how we can execute our script and we will learn how we can write for example our first hello world script now scripting in general is really uh you know deep concept and uh I can make a separate tutorial about scripting itself right so in this uh video I just want to give you the brief introduction about scripting and how you can use scripting so that you can uh build on that knowledge and you can you know learn about scripting in different video or different uh you know so from the different Source right so first of all what is a script a script is a text file that contains a sequence of command for a Linux based operating system so let's see how we can create a script so I'm going to open our terminal first of all and in this terminal first of all let's say we want to create a script on the desktop so I will just change the directory to the desktop and then I will use our Nano editor for creating a script so for creating a script you just need to write Nano and then the script name so for example I will name my script as uh my script itself now it's enough to give this uh name uh my script here but it's a good practice to give an extension of sh here for uh you know just showing the user that it's a script okay so I'm just adding the extension here but if you don't add this extension it'll work fine so it's uh not going to be different if you don't add this extension now first of all uh we need to know where our bash is located on our system so what I'm going to do is before creating a file or uh let's just create a file and then uh we are going to uh see further so Nano and then the name of the script and press enter and it's going to open this uh kind of Editor to you right now first uh line which you write in a script is this uh line which you need to use or it's a good practice uh to use this so first is you need to write hash and then this exclamation mark which is called hashbang and then the location of your bash now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a different

you need to just give the execute permission to it so you can just write um CH mod plus X for uh giving the execute permission to user group and uh the others and then your script name for example okay and then press enter and now your script has the execute permission right so in the last three video we have been learning how to give the permission to the script and that's why I'm I was uh you know creating those video to uh you know let you know how you can change the permission of a file now this will change the permission of a file to the execute so you can uh execute uh this script by giving this permission now once again when we do uh dot forward slash and then the script name and press enter what it does is it's going to list out the long listing of your desktop right so you can see let me just make it a little bit bigger and once again executed again and you can see it has done the long listing of uh on the desktop so you can see we have three files on the desktop and each
