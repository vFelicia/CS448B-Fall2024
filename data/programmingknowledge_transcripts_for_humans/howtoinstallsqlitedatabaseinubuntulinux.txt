00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to install escolite
00:04 - database in your Ubuntu Linux operating
00:07 - system so let's get
00:09 - started first of all you need to open
00:11 - your
00:12 - terminal and in your terminal you need
00:15 - to give this command pseudo apt minus
00:19 - get install escal 3 so this will install
00:24 - escolite version three in your system
00:27 - and then space lib escal 3 minus Dev so
00:32 - this uh lib escolite 3 minus Dev will
00:37 - install escolite development library in
00:40 - your system so you can uh develop
00:44 - different programs with your escal
00:46 - database for example if you want C++
00:49 - support for escolite then this Library
00:52 - will provide that so give this command
00:55 - and press enter and it will ask for your
00:58 - password so give your pass
01:00 - password and it will start installing
01:03 - escolite in your
01:16 - system so it's reading the database
01:19 - right
01:22 - now so now eslite 3 is installed in my
01:26 - system so I will clear the terminal
01:31 - and I will check whether escolite is
01:33 - really installed in my system or not so
01:35 - I will give the command
01:38 - esite 3 and press enter and it will give
01:42 - the version of the escolite which is
01:45 - present in your system so if it gives
01:48 - escal version whatever the version is
01:51 - then you know that escal is installed in
01:54 - your system and you will be able to see
01:57 - escal light and then this uh greater
02:00 - than sign and you know that your skite
02:04 - installed in your system now you can
02:07 - create a database and you can do many
02:11 - things by the command line uh in this uh
02:16 - open to operating system and you can uh
02:19 - also make the
02:22 - databases and to quit your database just
02:25 - write dot Qi T and press enter and it
02:29 - will quit from your
02:31 - database so for example uh right now I'm
02:35 - in
02:36 - my root directory so which is uh I will
02:41 - show you in which directory am I am and
02:45 - then I will create a database in that
02:48 - directory so in I right now I'm in my
02:50 - home directory right and for example I
02:55 - want to create a database in this folder
02:58 - which is my home directory then I will
03:00 - just write ski 3 and your database name.
03:03 - DB and press enter and it will create a
03:07 - database. DB in
03:10 - your in your uh folder where you have
03:14 - given the
03:15 - command right and you need to give some
03:19 - tables names and you need to install
03:22 - insert some other table information and
03:27 - then you will be able to use your
03:30 - escolite uh
03:32 - database now to check whether my
03:35 - database name. DB is really created I
03:39 - need to give the command dot d a t b AES
03:45 - databases and press enter and you see
03:49 - here you have
03:51 - the database in this location home and
03:57 - in my open to one folder there is a
04:00 - database called database. DB right and
04:03 - when I see here this database is also
04:07 - present here so I know that my database
04:10 - is created in my home
04:12 - folder and there are some more commands
04:16 - which you need to learn to uh query the
04:18 - database to insert some data into the
04:21 - table to create a table and to update or
04:24 - delete the content in the table that why
04:27 - I will show you in some other video
04:30 - so I hope you have enjoyed this video
