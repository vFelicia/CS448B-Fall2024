00:01 - hello guys are welcome to program
00:03 - acknowledge in the previous video we
00:05 - learned about how to create a basic
00:08 - window and providing image to it
00:11 - providing multiple widget status and a
00:13 - combo box introverts Labor's and buttons
00:16 - etc so let's show the output of it and
00:18 - we'll move on to the next one so this
00:22 - what we have looked in the previous
00:24 - video so if you are not familiar with it
00:26 - go ahead and check that out first or
00:29 - else you'll be lost so in this video
00:33 - we'll be looking into checkboxes radio
00:35 - buttons and the Kingdom message box so
00:39 - let's dive into it so from message box
00:43 - we'll just type in or kinter sorry mm
00:50 - import kinder message box one minute
01:00 - okay so kinder dot message box so it
01:08 - appeared and what will be two hours okay
01:13 - so this is how you can import a message
01:15 - box and let's create some check boxes
01:21 - and radio buttons right so for that you
01:23 - will have to create two more labels that
01:30 - is for gender and the language so which
01:34 - is dive into it one minute so so for the
01:40 - label fourth we'll be using
01:42 - okay we'll just type in over here so use
01:47 - this label
01:52 - copy and paste and rename it as a
02:00 - programming language language and place
02:10 - it somewhere like around 95 and 4 2 nd T
02:20 - right now we'll be using another label
02:22 - so paste it that again and we'll be
02:26 - using as agender 4 radio buttons and
02:32 - we'll also place that somewhere
02:37 - difference of 4 59 maybe and ok so let's
02:46 - see what is the output ok so it is a bit
02:51 - messed over here so as you can see and
02:56 - the buttons are overlapping ok so we
03:00 - look into that first so what we'll do
03:05 - over here is that we'll be changing the
03:07 - position of the button so we'll just
03:12 - move down and change the position of the
03:18 - buttons so we'll just change 5 1 5 that
03:24 - is 130 and Phi 1 5 and 280 I guess this
03:37 - should work so now the buttons have gone
03:43 - a bit down and we'll have to arrange the
03:46 - programming language labels ok so on the
03:52 - label ok for the programming language
03:56 - okay so 95 I will just change it around
04:02 - how about 85 maybe I guess let's check
04:09 - 87 and let's read on this so as you can
04:16 - see it is a bit aligned but we have to
04:19 - place it into the perfect position so
04:23 - let's check 80 okay now it looks a bit
04:29 - better so okay so labels are done and
04:34 - the buttons are placed at a good
04:37 - position so let's dive into creating the
04:40 - widgets right so for creating widgets
04:45 - create a variable C 1 is equal to check
04:52 - button method of kilter root comma text
05:04 - is equal to provide Java comma the
05:13 - variable
05:14 - net which we'll be using is equal to c
05:19 - VAR c 1 so for the check button 1 right
05:25 - and this course c1 being more specific
05:30 - this good or else it can get a bit
05:34 - messed up dot place so place X is equal
05:44 - to 235 and Y is equal to on to 420 right
05:55 - okay let's see whether it works or not
05:59 - save and rerun this so I guess there is
06:06 - no outputs you know I don't know what is
06:08 - the issue with this ok so there is some
06:14 - some
06:15 - arrow so the way table c1 is showing an
06:19 - error okay so as we have done before
06:22 - just mention it over here so we're
06:29 - underscore c1 is equal to a string where
06:35 - right now it will go I guess okay so as
06:41 - you can see this is a checkbox for the
06:45 - Java okay now we'll create another one
06:51 - for Python okay okay let's go down a bit
07:03 - so copy this one paste and change the
07:14 - text python change another c2 and of
07:21 - course since opposition or else it will
07:24 - be disoriented 90 and 420 will be good
07:28 - and we'll go top at the top and mention
07:34 - the c2 one right Wow c2 is equal to the
07:40 - string variable okay so this is the same
07:45 - as the intermediates really just fetch
07:48 - out or get the check box we are using
07:55 - save so these are the check boxes okay
08:06 - now we will just get into the radio
08:09 - button for the gender so for radio
08:13 - button r1 is equal to the radio button
08:23 - root and we just what it takes to
08:29 - it is equal to male comma and a variable
08:44 - for it too so re able is equal to Radio
08:56 - underscore where and we'll be using font
09:11 - or we don't require font and chest of
09:15 - the while a variable for it so here the
09:17 - value a argument will be using a
09:21 - argument called as value so what value
09:24 - you put into the radio button it will be
09:26 - used as an object for example if you
09:29 - want a value as a meal so you need to
09:32 - pass it as a string so value is equal to
09:36 - mention it as the string okay comma
09:41 - sorry dot place and same as X is equal
09:49 - to or 230 comma Y is equal to 420 we'll
10:02 - do the same for
10:11 - the female 1 and female just change it
10:17 - over here are two we have to change it
10:21 - over here too so the value for that will
10:24 - be female and place it like around the
10:30 - 90 and 60 around 60 right okay that's
10:37 - good
10:38 - and we'll be using this variable radio
10:41 - var like we done for the checkboxes
10:44 - radio ah and mentioning mentioning sorry
10:49 - is mentioned it at the top so we'll be
11:00 - seeing like let's go to the top and
11:05 - we'll be providing it over here sorry
11:08 - so radio underscore Y is equal to string
11:23 - right so for the checkboxes what I've
11:27 - noticed is that we don't need to use the
11:31 - get method but eventually we'll be using
11:33 - that but for that we have only two
11:36 - specific one that is Java and Python so
11:39 - you just mention it will do it better so
11:41 - for the vast sea one we are using Java
11:44 - and for the c2 we are using Python right
11:54 - okay so let's print out that also print
12:04 - the language which we'll be using so
12:08 - just before that create a variable valve
12:11 - is equal to sorry valve 3 is equal to
12:17 - that and let's go see one right so we
12:24 - are getting C 1 but we don't have to use
12:28 - you can use it based on your preference
12:30 - but here C 1 is already provided Java
12:33 - and C 2 is also provided as pythons you
12:35 - don't need to get it
12:36 - the value is Java and Python so that and
12:41 - for where so that's I guess that's for
12:49 - valve 3 again and that C 2 for the
12:59 - Python okay so okay so print that too
13:15 - so what we'll do over here is that we'll
13:17 - just pass three throw language is and
13:32 - for that for the gender we'll be using
13:37 - your gender is and sorry we have not
13:43 - used another variable for the radio
13:46 - button but we'll be using as where four
13:49 - is equal to radio dot where dot get okay
13:59 - so it looks in good and we'll be
14:02 - changing it over here as for so so this
14:08 - is the code and let's see what is the
14:10 - output okay so the gender is for the
14:19 - male is missing so let's check that out
14:23 - first
14:24 - oh okay okay okay what is the issue here
14:32 - so I guess there is some kind of placing
14:42 - issue but I can't see one and
15:04 - you
15:23 - okay okay I've got this but uh okay so
15:28 - for the radio button mail we are
15:33 - overlapping it I guess so it is with the
15:44 - 230 and 260 I guess okay so we just
15:48 - provide this as 260 and rerun this okay
15:53 - now that looks good okay so that looks
16:00 - in good and yeah it looks good so long
16:06 - we'll just okay so now we'll just shoot
16:11 - or show the output whether what it
16:13 - prints on the console so demo score user
16:22 - throw out some random digit for the date
16:27 - select the country this Python male so
16:36 - there is an output and the sorry though
16:40 - there is no error and the output is been
16:45 - printed so your gender is May the
16:48 - programming language is Python as we
16:50 - have selected so first name demo user
16:55 - concatenation and the date of birth is
16:57 - this the country is this from the
16:59 - combobox programming language is Python
17:02 - and the gender is male on clicking the
17:04 - sign up button so so for this and we
17:11 - have one more thing left and that is the
17:14 - message box right so for the message box
17:17 - we just need to type in the method that
17:24 - is kinder
17:28 - dot messagebox dot show info not error
17:36 - infrared and provide a title welcome
17:43 - come comma user that is also string so
17:50 - mention it into a string user is
17:56 - successfully signed up close it and
18:10 - let's see what is the output again so
18:14 - this is how you can provide a kingdom
18:16 - message box and it will be more clear
18:20 - when the output is shown so we'll be
18:23 - using another variable so user name
18:33 - sorry name to add some random digit
18:40 - select the country Python female and
18:48 - let's see sign up so this is a kinder
18:56 - message box so as you can see what we
18:59 - have provided over here that is on this
19:02 - first argument is our title sorry sorry
19:05 - for the spelling mistake but it is ok
19:11 - but the purpose has been solved this is
19:14 - the title and this is the user content
19:16 - so user is successfully signed up ok and
19:20 - this is the printed output from the
19:23 - widgets so in this video we have learned
19:27 - about the message box printer message
19:29 - box showing an output into it and how
19:34 - you can use a radio buttons and check
19:36 - box within the Pinto Pinto so this is it
19:40 - for this video guys
19:42 - and thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys are welcome to program acknowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create a basic window and providing image to it providing multiple widget status and a combo box introverts Labor's and buttons etc so let's show the output of it and we'll move on to the next one so this what we have looked in the previous video so if you are not familiar with it go ahead and check that out first or else you'll be lost so in this video we'll be looking into checkboxes radio buttons and the Kingdom message box so let's dive into it so from message box we'll just type in or kinter sorry mm import kinder message box one minute okay so kinder dot message box so it appeared and what will be two hours okay so this is how you can import a message box and let's create some check boxes and radio buttons right so for that you will have to create two more labels that is for gender and the language so which is dive into it one minute so so for the label fourth we'll be using okay we'll just type in over here so use this label copy and paste and rename it as a programming language language and place it somewhere like around 95 and 4 2 nd T right now we'll be using another label so paste it that again and we'll be using as agender 4 radio buttons and we'll also place that somewhere difference of 4 59 maybe and ok so let's see what is the output ok so it is a bit messed over here so as you can see and the buttons are overlapping ok so we look into that first so what we'll do over here is that we'll be changing the position of the button so we'll just move down and change the position of the buttons so we'll just change 5 1 5 that is 130 and Phi 1 5 and 280 I guess this should work so now the buttons have gone a bit down and we'll have to arrange the programming language labels ok so on the label ok for the programming language okay so 95 I will just change it around how about 85 maybe I guess let's check 87 and let's read on this so as you can see it is a bit aligned but we have to place it into the perfect position so let's check 80 okay now it looks a bit better so okay so labels are done and the buttons are placed at a good position so let's dive into creating the widgets right so for creating widgets create a variable C 1 is equal to check button method of kilter root comma text is equal to provide Java comma the variable net which we'll be using is equal to c VAR c 1 so for the check button 1 right and this course c1 being more specific this good or else it can get a bit messed up dot place so place X is equal to 235 and Y is equal to on to 420 right okay let's see whether it works or not save and rerun this so I guess there is no outputs you know I don't know what is the issue with this ok so there is some some arrow so the way table c1 is showing an error okay so as we have done before just mention it over here so we're underscore c1 is equal to a string where right now it will go I guess okay so as you can see this is a checkbox for the Java okay now we'll create another one for Python okay okay let's go down a bit so copy this one paste and change the text python change another c2 and of course since opposition or else it will be disoriented 90 and 420 will be good and we'll go top at the top and mention the c2 one right Wow c2 is equal to the string variable okay so this is the same as the intermediates really just fetch out or get the check box we are using save so these are the check boxes okay now we will just get into the radio button for the gender so for radio button r1 is equal to the radio button root and we just what it takes to it is equal to male comma and a variable for it too so re able is equal to Radio underscore where and we'll be using font or we don't require font and chest of the while a variable for it so here the value a argument will be using a argument called as value so what value you put into the radio button it will be used as an object for example if you want a value as a meal so you need to pass it as a string so value is equal to mention it as the string okay comma sorry dot place and same as X is equal to or 230 comma Y is equal to 420 we'll do the same for the female 1 and female just change it over here are two we have to change it over here too so the value for that will be female and place it like around the 90 and 60 around 60 right okay that's good and we'll be using this variable radio var like we done for the checkboxes radio ah and mentioning mentioning sorry is mentioned it at the top so we'll be seeing like let's go to the top and we'll be providing it over here sorry so radio underscore Y is equal to string right so for the checkboxes what I've noticed is that we don't need to use the get method but eventually we'll be using that but for that we have only two specific one that is Java and Python so you just mention it will do it better so for the vast sea one we are using Java and for the c2 we are using Python right okay so let's print out that also print the language which we'll be using so just before that create a variable valve is equal to sorry valve 3 is equal to that and let's go see one right so we are getting C 1 but we don't have to use you can use it based on your preference but here C 1 is already provided Java and C 2 is also provided as pythons you don't need to get it the value is Java and Python so that and for where so that's I guess that's for valve 3 again and that C 2 for the Python okay so okay so print that too so what we'll do over here is that we'll just pass three throw language is and for that for the gender we'll be using your gender is and sorry we have not used another variable for the radio button but we'll be using as where four is equal to radio dot where dot get okay so it looks in good and we'll be changing it over here as for so so this is the code and let's see what is the output okay so the gender is for the male is missing so let's check that out first oh okay okay okay what is the issue here so I guess there is some kind of placing issue but I can't see one and you okay okay I've got this but uh okay so for the radio button mail we are overlapping it I guess so it is with the 230 and 260 I guess okay so we just provide this as 260 and rerun this okay now that looks good okay so that looks in good and yeah it looks good so long we'll just okay so now we'll just shoot or show the output whether what it prints on the console so demo score user throw out some random digit for the date select the country this Python male so there is an output and the sorry though there is no error and the output is been printed so your gender is May the programming language is Python as we have selected so first name demo user concatenation and the date of birth is this the country is this from the combobox programming language is Python and the gender is male on clicking the sign up button so so for this and we have one more thing left and that is the message box right so for the message box we just need to type in the method that is kinder dot messagebox dot show info not error infrared and provide a title welcome come comma user that is also string so mention it into a string user is successfully signed up close it and let's see what is the output again so this is how you can provide a kingdom message box and it will be more clear when the output is shown so we'll be using another variable so user name sorry name to add some random digit select the country Python female and let's see sign up so this is a kinder message box so as you can see what we have provided over here that is on this first argument is our title sorry sorry for the spelling mistake but it is ok but the purpose has been solved this is the title and this is the user content so user is successfully signed up ok and this is the printed output from the widgets so in this video we have learned about the message box printer message box showing an output into it and how you can use a radio buttons and check box within the Pinto Pinto so this is it for this video guys and thanks for watching
