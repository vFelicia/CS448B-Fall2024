00:00 - hey guys welcome to this video in which
00:01 - we will talk about which programming
00:04 - language you should learn first now
00:07 - first of all I want to say that you
00:10 - should not learn a language in order to
00:13 - get a high paying job because according
00:16 - to me that's a wrong aim to follow
00:19 - according to me the first language
00:22 - should be the one in which you should
00:26 - stay interested or you should remain
00:28 - interested in also the first language
00:31 - should be the one we should not turn
00:34 - people off from programming so the first
00:37 - aim is the interest now every
00:40 - programming language is a good
00:42 - programming language if it gets your
00:45 - work done efficiently so there is no
00:48 - particular good of programming language
00:51 - we are talking about the first
00:53 - programming language to learn to stay
00:56 - interested in the programming so now
00:59 - let's talk about some options so I
01:02 - started learning programming with the C
01:05 - programming language so C was the first
01:08 - programming language which I learned but
01:12 - this was about 10 to 15 years ago and C
01:16 - programming language was the best option
01:18 - at that time the second reason of
01:21 - starting C as my first programming
01:23 - language was I was interested in
01:26 - programming microcontrollers or micro
01:28 - processors and C was the best option for
01:32 - that at that time and I think still is
01:35 - the best option if you are interested in
01:38 - IOT or embedded system or microprocessor
01:41 - or microcontroller programming C and C++
01:44 - are the best options right now according
01:48 - to me now some schools and colleges also
01:51 - teach Java and C++ as the first language
01:54 - which they teach to their students now
01:58 - according to me these languages like C
02:00 - C++ or Java are all good languages but
02:04 - they should not be the first language
02:06 - you should consider to learn if you want
02:09 - to start learning and stay interested in
02:13 - the simple reason is these languages
02:16 - lead to many traps for the people who
02:19 - aren't already familiar with how the
02:22 - computer works so for example if you
02:25 - want to even execute a single line code
02:27 - in these languages you need to follow
02:30 - some complex procedures for example in
02:33 - case of C and C++ you need to install
02:36 - the compiler and in case of Java also
02:40 - you need to install Java and JDK and JRE
02:44 - in order to run your first program in
02:48 - these languages so these languages makes
02:51 - you deal with the compiling and linking
02:55 - so let's say some error occurs in those
02:58 - languages during linking or the
03:00 - compiling stage the errors are not so
03:04 - clear and you might wonder what is
03:06 - happening and a normal programmer start
03:10 - wondering what's happening to me
03:13 - I just want to write a single line of
03:15 - code and this programming language makes
03:19 - me do all sorts of things so sometimes
03:22 - people gets irritated with those
03:25 - procedures and they turn their back to
03:28 - those programming languages so according
03:31 - to me this first programming language
03:33 - should be the one which is simple to
03:36 - write and you should be able to see the
03:38 - result instantly the other reason is the
03:41 - syntax the syntax of those languages are
03:45 - really complex for example if you want
03:47 - to write a single line of Java code you
03:50 - need to create a class before even
03:53 - writing a single line of code so up
03:56 - first programming language should be the
03:58 - one which should not irritate the
04:01 - programmer so our developer or
04:04 - programmer should stay interested in
04:06 - programming for the first time he starts
04:09 - learning programming so if these
04:11 - languages are not the answers what
04:14 - programming language you should learn so
04:17 - the answer according to me is iton
04:20 - programming language and the first
04:22 - reason for this is because python is
04:26 - interpreted
04:27 - rather than compiled a language which
04:30 - means that you should not deal with the
04:33 - compiling and linking of any sorts of
04:37 - code to your linker which means you
04:40 - don't have to deal with some ceremonies
04:42 - like compiling or linking with your code
04:45 - and that means you can just write a
04:48 - single line of code and executed in a
04:51 - special terminal which is called repl or
04:54 - repple which stands for read eval print
04:57 - loop so you can even evaluate a single
05:01 - line of code using this readable print
05:04 - loop environment which is very easy to
05:07 - use so you get instant feedback of your
05:11 - code this means that you can learn
05:14 - faster and develop faster if you have
05:17 - started learning so this doesn't
05:19 - irritate you the next reason is Python
05:23 - is a multi-paradigm programming language
05:25 - so it lets you learn every concept in
05:29 - programming whether it's object-oriented
05:32 - programming or functional programming or
05:34 - procedural programming so it enables you
05:37 - to learn everything in programming now
05:40 - let me show you some other reasons why
05:42 - should you learn Python as your first
05:45 - programming language so as I told you
05:47 - that it is an interpreted language
05:50 - rather than a compiled language so you
05:52 - get the feedback of your code instantly
05:56 - this means you baste lesser time in
05:59 - compiling your code and you get more
06:02 - time in learning that language the
06:05 - second reason is Python is very easy
06:08 - programming language to learn so Python
06:11 - programming language is really simple
06:14 - and easy to learn if you are learning
06:16 - programming for the first time some
06:19 - people say if somebody writes a good
06:22 - Python script it's like reading English
06:25 - language it's so simple so if you want
06:28 - to print hello world it's one line code
06:31 - in other programming languages like C
06:33 - C++ or Java
06:35 - you need to write more than one line of
06:37 - code in order to even print as
06:40 - single hello world on the terminal in
06:43 - Python you just have to write print
06:46 - hello world and it will print hello
06:49 - world on the terminal the next reason is
06:52 - Python is used in diverse application so
06:56 - if you are thinking about learning
06:59 - artificial intelligence or machine
07:01 - learning which are the buzzword right
07:04 - now and also it is predicted that for
07:08 - the next five years at least these
07:11 - technologies will be at the forefront of
07:14 - the next technology revolution so if you
07:17 - are interested in learning those cutting
07:20 - edge technologies like machine learning
07:22 - and artificial intelligence
07:25 - I think Python will be the best option
07:28 - because there are specialized libraries
07:31 - available in Python
07:32 - in order to do a complex calculation in
07:35 - Python for machine learning or
07:37 - artificial intelligence and those
07:39 - libraries are numpy or Sai PI and also
07:44 - given the flexibility of Python
07:46 - programming language and it's machine
07:48 - learning functionality are delivered by
07:51 - the libraries such as Sai kit or Tara's
07:55 - and also Google's new tensorflow
07:58 - libraries so according to me if you are
08:00 - remotely interested in machine learning
08:04 - or artificial intelligence you should
08:07 - choose Python as your first programming
08:10 - language now if you are thinking about
08:12 - becoming a cloud computing expert or
08:15 - DevOps technology expert item is also
08:19 - good language for those technologies
08:22 - also if you want to become a big data
08:25 - expert there are some libraries right
08:27 - now like PI spark which has a high
08:30 - demand in big data industry if you want
08:34 - to develop a IOT device IOT stands for
08:36 - Internet of Things and if you are
08:39 - interested in embedded systems Python
08:42 - scripting will allow you to do your job
08:44 - efficiently so if you are interested in
08:47 - IOT Python is good for that also now if
08:50 - you are interested in web development
08:52 - there are library
08:53 - such as Django or flask which enables
08:56 - you to do the web development if you are
08:59 - interested in creating the graphical
09:01 - user interfaces there are libraries such
09:04 - as pi QT or pi GUI or pi gtk which
09:09 - enables you to create graphical user
09:10 - interfaces using Python language if you
09:14 - are interested in testing and automation
09:17 - also Python is up good programming
09:20 - languages because testing tools like
09:22 - selenium also use Python in order to run
09:26 - those tests and the last reason is
09:28 - increasing demand in industry for Python
09:31 - so as I said this should not be the
09:35 - criteria to learn Python as your first
09:38 - programming language but if you are
09:40 - interested in the industry demand
09:43 - Ayten also fulfils this and also I want
09:47 - to show this graph to you also and this
09:50 - graph is of the overall question Muse
09:53 - each month on stake overflow and the
09:57 - demand of Python is at the top so for
10:00 - the next few years
10:02 - Python will be the most growing language
10:06 - according to me and according to some
10:08 - projections also so that's it you got
10:11 - your answer if you are interested in
10:13 - learning programming and if you are
10:16 - confused about which language you should
10:19 - learn first then Python will be the best
10:22 - option for you to start learning
10:25 - programming I hope you have enjoyed this
10:28 - video and I will see you in the next
10:30 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to this video in which we will talk about which programming language you should learn first now first of all I want to say that you should not learn a language in order to get a high paying job because according to me that's a wrong aim to follow according to me the first language should be the one in which you should stay interested or you should remain interested in also the first language should be the one we should not turn people off from programming so the first aim is the interest now every programming language is a good programming language if it gets your work done efficiently so there is no particular good of programming language we are talking about the first programming language to learn to stay interested in the programming so now let's talk about some
