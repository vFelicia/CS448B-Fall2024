00:00 - hey guys welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge
00:03 - these are that tutorial let's start so
00:07 - before starting first let us discuss
00:09 - what we have seen overall till now we
00:12 - have seen what is Kivi we have seen why
00:13 - Kiwi is used how Kiwi is used and that
00:15 - Vantage's of losing TV over other
00:18 - languages then we saw the setup of Kiwi
00:21 - in the second tutorial followed by we
00:23 - saw how we are opening an app it code
00:25 - explanation and the displaying of text
00:28 - with code explanation and then we have
00:30 - seen creating a button with code
00:31 - explanation so in the last tutorial we
00:34 - ended creating a button which is or full
00:37 - which is of full page now we see how we
00:40 - are going to alter the button in a
00:42 - smaller format so for for doing that we
00:47 - are going to set the button properties
00:49 - in the method for the code now what is
00:53 - the button properties we require we
00:55 - require the position of the button and
00:56 - size of the button for position of the
00:58 - button we use pause which is position
01:01 - POS equals to value comma value these
01:05 - are X and y-axis we define the method
01:07 - which is post equals to value comma
01:09 - value then we use for size of the button
01:12 - size underscore hand followed by the two
01:15 - values which is value comma value which
01:18 - we are going to define in the method let
01:20 - us know go and run this by applying in
01:24 - the code
01:29 - No first I will import the following
01:33 - button and there it is from TV door
01:42 - import then from TV door UI X dot button
01:56 - button no I'm going to kill the class
02:03 - then I'm going to use the app which I
02:07 - have imported now I'm going to open the
02:12 - class file and define the method by D
02:14 - FBI LD and self key word now a skater
02:21 - the class key to the third define the
02:24 - method now I'm going to create the
02:26 - variable called BTN in which I'm going
02:28 - to show the button which I'm going to
02:30 - create right now is button Android the
02:33 - text which is equals to push me under
02:39 - the course No
02:41 - as discussed I'm going to use here the
02:45 - size and the pause which is size and of
02:48 - coherent is the button size and POS is
02:51 - the position of the button no comma size
02:56 - underscore hint here I'm giving equals
03:04 - to and embroidering the point 2 comma
03:09 - point 2 which is the size of the pattern
03:11 - and ps2 open the bracket I'm going to
03:18 - provide let us say 300 comma 250 it will
03:22 - be coming somewhere around here as I
03:25 - have defined three hundred combo 250 so
03:29 - if I'm going to provide some other
03:31 - values according to those values button
03:34 - will be created let's see if I am going
03:36 - one two or like any other values higher
03:39 - button size will be higher
03:41 - I do have given point to come upon - so
03:44 - the button will be smaller and the
03:46 - position accordingly of the screen so
03:48 - 300 turn 250 means it will be coming
03:50 - somewhere around here okay
03:54 - no coming back to the code I'm going to
03:57 - return the button which is by using
03:59 - return to make sure the button is
04:03 - displayed so I am going to use the
04:05 - return it unbuttoned okay no let's run
04:10 - the code by providing it in the main
04:14 - method which is if underscore underscore
04:16 - name underscore underscore equals 2
04:20 - equals 2 inside the first two feely and
04:23 - let's go and ESCO main underscore
04:26 - underscore and I'm going to open the
04:30 - main method now let's run the button app
04:33 - by calling button and bracket don't run
04:43 - so let's know run the court what is the
04:48 - expected output
04:49 - he's like button will be coming over
04:51 - here with the size Oh point 2 comma
04:53 - point 2 which is the length and the
04:55 - bread and the position of the button
04:58 - will be coming in 300 comma 250 size of
05:01 - the screen
05:01 - let's now on the court so here we go as
05:08 - expected the button is created with the
05:11 - size of point 2 comma point 2 along with
05:13 - the 300 comma 250 which is over here if
05:17 - I'm going to provide some other values
05:19 - for the size underscore it hint and the
05:22 - position so it will be coming like as
05:26 - you are providing the size no let's go
05:33 - back and understand the code how it
05:35 - worked
05:39 - as you can see where if like
05:44 - I'm running the button app dot run it's
05:47 - coming on here and it will be coming
05:50 - under the definition method and it's
05:53 - taking the push me which we saw the push
05:55 - me text and the size underscore hint
05:57 - followed by the position this is how the
06:00 - alterations of button are done in the
06:02 - last tutorial we created the button
06:04 - which was in the full screen so you can
06:07 - go back and take a look at the tutorial
06:10 - number two in which I have created the
06:13 - button so this is how it's going to run
06:15 - so we have altered the button using this
06:19 - code the coming tutorials will be seeing
06:22 - other parts of the library thank you for
06:24 - joining with programming knowledge

hey guys welcome to programming knowledge these are that tutorial let's start so before starting first let us discuss what we have seen overall till now we have seen what is Kivi we have seen why Kiwi is used how Kiwi is used and that Vantage's of losing TV over other languages then we saw the setup of Kiwi in the second tutorial followed by we saw how we are opening an app it code explanation and the displaying of text with code explanation and then we have seen creating a button with code explanation so in the last tutorial we ended creating a button which is or full which is of full page now we see how we are going to alter the button in a smaller format so for for doing that we are going to set the button properties in the method for the code now what is the button properties we require we require the position of the button and size of the button for position of the button we use pause which is position POS equals to value comma value these are X and yaxis we define the method which is post equals to value comma value then we use for size of the button size underscore hand followed by the two values which is value comma value which we are going to define in the method let us know go and run this by applying in the code No first I will import the following button and there it is from TV door import then from TV door UI X dot button button no I'm going to kill the class then I'm going to use the app which I have imported now I'm going to open the class file and define the method by D FBI LD and self key word now a skater the class key to the third define the method now I'm going to create the variable called BTN in which I'm going to show the button which I'm going to create right now is button Android the text which is equals to push me under the course No as discussed I'm going to use here the size and the pause which is size and of coherent is the button size and POS is the position of the button no comma size underscore hint here I'm giving equals to and embroidering the point 2 comma point 2 which is the size of the pattern and ps2 open the bracket I'm going to provide let us say 300 comma 250 it will be coming somewhere around here as I have defined three hundred combo 250 so if I'm going to provide some other values according to those values button will be created let's see if I am going one two or like any other values higher button size will be higher I do have given point to come upon so the button will be smaller and the position accordingly of the screen so 300 turn 250 means it will be coming somewhere around here okay no coming back to the code I'm going to return the button which is by using return to make sure the button is displayed so I am going to use the return it unbuttoned okay no let's run the code by providing it in the main method which is if underscore underscore name underscore underscore equals 2 equals 2 inside the first two feely and let's go and ESCO main underscore underscore and I'm going to open the main method now let's run the button app by calling button and bracket don't run so let's know run the court what is the expected output he's like button will be coming over here with the size Oh point 2 comma point 2 which is the length and the bread and the position of the button will be coming in 300 comma 250 size of the screen let's now on the court so here we go as expected the button is created with the size of point 2 comma point 2 along with the 300 comma 250 which is over here if I'm going to provide some other values for the size underscore it hint and the position so it will be coming like as you are providing the size no let's go back and understand the code how it worked as you can see where if like I'm running the button app dot run it's coming on here and it will be coming under the definition method and it's taking the push me which we saw the push me text and the size underscore hint followed by the position this is how the alterations of button are done in the last tutorial we created the button which was in the full screen so you can go back and take a look at the tutorial number two in which I have created the button so this is how it's going to run so we have altered the button using this code the coming tutorials will be seeing other parts of the library thank you for joining with programming knowledge
