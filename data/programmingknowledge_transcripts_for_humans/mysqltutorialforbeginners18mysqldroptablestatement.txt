00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will say that
00:05 - how to drop a table or delete the entire
00:08 - table okay it's very easy to drop a
00:12 - table just open your terminal mask
00:20 - you'll icon you
00:29 - okay next show databases here we have
00:36 - database database so me just use there
00:47 - so Abel's here you can see we have two
00:56 - tables student and TAM I created the
01:01 - temp table because I don't want to
01:04 - delete this front oven because we need a
01:07 - table or further use and let's say
01:12 - select star from temp so as you can see
01:19 - the evil is empty now and it has only
01:24 - one column which is ideal so let me
01:28 - insert some value insert into values
01:37 - let's say one
01:46 - okay as you can see now it has zero one
01:52 - two and three now I do not want to
01:57 - delete these rows but instead of it I
02:02 - want to delete this entire table I don't
02:06 - want this table in my database anymore
02:08 - so I write drop table and then provide
02:15 - the name of the table with the stem okay
02:21 - so let me show you show tables as you
02:29 - can see temp table is no more in our
02:33 - database so just close this open MySQL
02:39 - workbench open so as you can see if we
02:46 - have already deleted the tenth table so
02:49 - let me just create the another one
02:53 - create ever I am
03:01 - Aleksei ID name okay
03:17 - refresh as you can see them already
03:23 - stated is ID in name so you don't need
03:28 - to really assert a value in order to
03:32 - draw up a table if table is empty then
03:37 - you can also delete a table it makes no
03:39 - sense but let me just insert some of the
03:44 - values insert into
03:56 - then you let me just see
04:06 - in
04:08 - one routine
04:16 - and the value is to mix them up
04:23 - okay
04:26 - so select star from damn
04:37 - and as you can see protocols are
04:39 - accepted now there are two method in
04:42 - this MySQL workmen that you can delete
04:46 - or drop a table if you want to delete or
04:50 - drop a table so SQL command so you just
04:55 - need to write drop table and then
05:00 - profitable and when you've had this very
05:04 - time cover will be deleted from your
05:06 - database but you do not want to delete
05:10 - the table why are these SQL statement so
05:15 - what you can do is go to the tables
05:19 - select the table that you want to delete
05:22 - just right-click on it and drop every
05:28 - drop now and it will be doing it ends
05:32 - again okay so thanks for watching
