00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - node.js tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how we can use
00:06 - readable streams in node.js and we have
00:11 - used this method called create restreams
00:14 - to create an object of read streams and
00:18 - then we have called this method on this
00:22 - readable stream object which on data
00:25 - event was you know reading a chunk of
00:29 - data from a file which we have created
00:32 - last time yeah and whenever a chunk of
00:36 - file is read then it's going to be used
00:40 - using this variable chunk in this
00:43 - anonymous function right so if you are
00:45 - not sure what I'm talking about
00:48 - just see the last video to be clear now
00:51 - in this video we will see how we can use
00:53 - a writable streams in no chairs so for
00:57 - example you have some buffer stream
01:01 - coming from somewhere for example from
01:04 - this file itself whatever we read from a
01:09 - big file we have we have created last
01:11 - time we want to write this data which we
01:15 - are reading in chunks to another file in
01:18 - chunks so we are not reading the whole
01:21 - file and then writing to a new file we
01:25 - are reading chunks and also writing
01:28 - chunks so it's not going to block your
01:30 - code okay so let's see how we can create
01:34 - writable streams in nodejs now to create
01:38 - a writable streams I'm going to use this
01:41 - code which I have written in the last
01:43 - video to read the file right and now we
01:46 - will create a writable streams just
01:48 - write var write stream is equal to FS
01:51 - dot create write stream and then we can
01:55 - give the name of the file in which we
01:58 - want to you know send our stream to so
02:01 - for example I can name my file as write
02:07 - by dot txt okay
02:11 - this will be the file in
02:13 - which we want to write our data now to
02:16 - use this right seam is really easy
02:19 - whenever you read this data so here on
02:23 - the data event we are we were reading
02:26 - the data right so in order to write it
02:29 - to a file you can just call this right
02:33 - stream object and then you can call a
02:36 - method called right on it so just simply
02:40 - call a method called right and then it
02:44 - takes a chunk as an argument so you can
02:47 - just pass this argument here and this
02:50 - you know chunk will be written to the
02:53 - right stream object and in turn it will
02:57 - be written to the right file dot txt
03:01 - okay so let's run the code and let's see
03:04 - how it works so I'm going to open a
03:07 - terminal and run my code and it has just
03:12 - printed these lines which indicates
03:15 - chunk of data read you can see and then
03:19 - we can see a file is created here with
03:23 - the name right file it has the same
03:25 - content as our file dot txt have okay so
03:31 - this is essentially just writing the
03:35 - chunk of data as it reads the data from
03:39 - a file now in the previous videos we
03:42 - have also seen how we can write the data
03:45 - using the right file function right now
03:50 - the difference between this right stream
03:51 - dot right and the right file function is
03:56 - in the right file function we were just
03:59 - you know flushing all the data which we
04:03 - have in the buffer and it's not you know
04:07 - going to the file in which we want to
04:10 - write chunk by chunk but we were writing
04:13 - it in in a single shot right but using
04:17 - this method you can you know write the
04:20 - data to a file in chunks whenever you
04:23 - have data right so this is the benefit
04:26 - of this
04:27 - the method or and right streams over the
04:31 - right file method okay so I hope you've
04:34 - enjoyed this video please welcome and
04:35 - subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on node.js tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use readable streams in node.js and we have used this method called create restreams to create an object of read streams and then we have called this method on this readable stream object which on data event was you know reading a chunk of data from a file which we have created last time yeah and whenever a chunk of file is read then it's going to be used using this variable chunk in this anonymous function right so if you are not sure what I'm talking about just see the last video to be clear now in this video we will see how we can use a writable streams in no chairs so for example you have some buffer stream coming from somewhere for example from this file itself whatever we read from a big file we have we have created last time we want to write this data which we are reading in chunks to another file in chunks so we are not reading the whole file and then writing to a new file we are reading chunks and also writing chunks so it's not going to block your code okay so let's see how we can create writable streams in nodejs now to create a writable streams I'm going to use this code which I have written in the last video to read the file right and now we will create a writable streams just write var write stream is equal to FS dot create write stream and then we can give the name of the file in which we want to you know send our stream to so for example I can name my file as write by dot txt okay this will be the file in which we want to write our data now to use this right seam is really easy whenever you read this data so here on the data event we are we were reading the data right so in order to write it to a file you can just call this right stream object and then you can call a method called right on it so just simply call a method called right and then it takes a chunk as an argument so you can just pass this argument here and this you know chunk will be written to the right stream object and in turn it will be written to the right file dot txt okay so let's run the code and let's see how it works so I'm going to open a terminal and run my code and it has just printed these lines which indicates chunk of data read you can see and then we can see a file is created here with the name right file it has the same content as our file dot txt have okay so this is essentially just writing the chunk of data as it reads the data from a file now in the previous videos we have also seen how we can write the data using the right file function right now the difference between this right stream dot right and the right file function is in the right file function we were just you know flushing all the data which we have in the buffer and it's not you know going to the file in which we want to write chunk by chunk but we were writing it in in a single shot right but using this method you can you know write the data to a file in chunks whenever you have data right so this is the benefit of this the method or and right streams over the right file method okay so I hope you've enjoyed this video please welcome and subscribe and bye for now
