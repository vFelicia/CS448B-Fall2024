With timestamps:

00:00 - now in this particular video we are
00:01 - going to cover about a ch group command
00:03 - it basically means the change group
00:05 - or you can say the change group
00:07 - ownership okay from one group to another
00:10 - okay to understand this uh
00:12 - command just think like a basic scenario
00:14 - suppose there is there are the two teams
00:16 - in a company that is the one for our
00:18 - tester and another for the
00:20 - you can say uh like developer okay
00:23 - uh suppose uh tester wants to share uh
00:26 - one file or
00:28 - to some other group members that is uh
00:31 - they these are some kind of group
00:33 - members okay
00:34 - so uh
00:36 - not
00:37 - for a particular member of that group
00:39 - but
00:40 - this stem tester team wants to share
00:42 - those files to all the groups so in this
00:45 - scenario we can easily use this ch group
00:48 - command
00:49 - okay so in this kind of scene it will be
00:51 - helpful
00:53 - because
00:54 - you don't have to share that file to one
00:56 - particular user okay so that if you
01:00 - share that file or change the ownership
01:03 - from from file to that group so every
01:06 - member of that particular you group can
01:08 - easily access the
01:11 - you can easily access that particular
01:13 - file okay
01:14 - so to understand this scenario first
01:16 - what we will need to do we will first
01:18 - need to create a group
01:19 - okay i hope it is visible to you guys uh
01:23 - so to
01:24 - add groups what is the command so the
01:27 - command is nothing but the
01:29 - group add and
01:31 - group name
01:32 - okay so what we will do group add
01:36 - and let's make a group name as a
01:38 - developers
01:40 - permission and because we have not used
01:41 - sudo
01:48 - uh
01:49 - sorry i haven't a wrong password i think
01:52 - yeah group has been created uh now what
01:54 - i will do i will just uh create two
01:56 - users
01:58 - add user
02:00 - user one
02:03 - again we have to use sudo
02:06 - password
02:09 - no extra information i have to draw it
02:11 - yes
02:12 - user1 is added user 2
02:16 - test
02:18 - test
02:21 - yes both the user has been created now
02:23 - what we have to do we have to just uh
02:26 - add those two users into the developer
02:28 - group okay so how you can add
02:31 - those two users into the developer group
02:33 - so for that also we have a particular
02:35 - command that is a user modification so i
02:37 - will use sudo user mod hyphen a
02:40 - and uh
02:42 - we use i think hyphen g and the group
02:44 - name is developers
02:46 - and the name of the user that is a user
02:50 - user one and user two i hope it should
02:53 - work again not working user one if i
02:56 - provide
02:57 - i added and again user two okay so
03:00 - groups has been added uh these two users
03:02 - have been added to the developer group
03:04 - to check
03:05 - what you can do
03:08 - gtent and group okay so here you can see
03:12 - user1 and user2 and in developers we
03:15 - have two users that is user1 and
03:18 - user2
03:19 - okay
03:20 - so uh now what we have to do uh i will
03:23 - create a one file with our root user so
03:26 - first of all what i will do i will
03:28 - change my
03:30 - like switch to the root user
03:34 - i will go move back to directory in ls
03:38 - okay we have file.txt i will first
03:40 - remove
03:42 - file.txt and
03:45 - test
03:48 - okay both are you now what we have to do
03:50 - i will create one file that is touch
03:52 - file dot txt
03:54 - okay so if i will change check the
03:57 - permissions for this particular file so
04:00 - here you can see we have root root the
04:03 - user is root and the group is also root
04:05 - user so in this case what we have to do
04:07 - we have to just change the group
04:09 - ownership not user
04:11 - like this one if we have to change this
04:12 - group ownership to
04:15 - some other users or to some other group
04:18 - so but in this case here you can see in
04:20 - the permission we have the group has
04:22 - only read permission okay
04:24 - so now what we can do
04:26 - we can change the group
04:29 - from root to which group that is a
04:31 - developer group so for this we have a
04:33 - command that
04:35 - is ch group so how you can do it
04:38 - ch group
04:40 - ch
04:42 - grp and the group name is developers
04:48 - okay developers and then whatever we
04:51 - have to just provide the file name
04:54 - okay now i will do a less hyphen and
04:56 - file.txt and here you can see the group
04:58 - name has been changed from root to
05:00 - developers
05:01 - okay so now what i will do i will login
05:04 - using uh both the user
05:07 - su user1
05:09 - and i will
05:11 - enter the password test
05:13 - and again one more terminal i will open
05:15 - up here
05:18 - like this i will increase the font size
05:21 - so it should be visible to you
05:23 - and seo which use it that was user 2
05:27 - okay
05:28 - and again
05:30 - enter the password same thing
05:32 - move back
05:36 - here also the same thing i will do i
05:37 - will move back one directory and i will
05:39 - do ls hyphen l and file.txt
05:42 - and here you can see developers and
05:45 - again here
05:49 - developers
05:50 - okay
05:52 - uh wait a minute
05:58 - um what key i just entered yeah
06:02 - lsi final file.txt okay so here you can
06:06 - see in both the scenario we are getting
06:08 - developer as a group okay so now what i
06:11 - as a user one i will try to like change
06:15 - the
06:16 - some file content file.txt and here you
06:20 - can see it is showing me permission
06:21 - denied
06:22 - why it is showing permission denied
06:25 - because
06:27 - here you can see we have not added any
06:30 - kind of permission he has just read
06:33 - permissions okay
06:36 - so now what we can do
06:44 - okay so we have only the read permission
06:46 - here for the groups okay so if i will
06:49 - just
06:50 - try to access so i can just only read
06:53 - this file.txt but if i want to uh
06:57 - add some kind of text or add something
06:59 - in that particular file
07:00 - so here you can see the permission is
07:03 - denied so now what we will need to do we
07:05 - will need to just add permission for the
07:07 - groups for that particular file okay so
07:10 - how we can do it using the chmod command
07:12 - just
07:13 - because uh
07:14 - we don't have put uh like execute
07:16 - permission to the groups that's why we
07:18 - are getting this error so chmod or what
07:20 - you can do for group g plus i will do uh
07:24 - write and execute and i will remove the
07:26 - read permission
07:27 - uh for others and the file name that is
07:29 - file.txt
07:32 - and done
07:33 - and now in this case i will just say
07:35 - check
07:38 - so here you can see
07:40 - uh read write execute has been added for
07:42 - groups and
07:44 - read has been removed from for others
07:46 - okay and the group is developers as we
07:49 - performed earlier so now what we can do
07:52 - uh
07:53 - if i will try to access this
07:56 - file that file file.txt
07:58 - so now let's try for user one i will
08:01 - remove all those things so cat
08:04 - file.txt
08:07 - so here you can see i will just hi
08:10 - this line has been entered by
08:14 - [Music]
08:15 - user
08:17 - one
08:17 - ctrl d to save
08:19 - and again here also uh i will
08:22 - i will here i will try to access this
08:24 - file
08:26 - sorry file.txt
08:29 - and here you can see that line i'm
08:31 - getting and for
08:32 - user 2 also i will try to enter some
08:35 - line
08:37 - with respect to user 2 that is hi
08:41 - this line has been
08:44 - added by
08:46 - user
08:47 - 2.
08:49 - ctrl t to save
08:50 - and again i will try to access so let's
08:53 - access by user1
08:57 - not user on
08:58 - its file.txt
09:01 - and here you can see both the lines has
09:03 - been added and it is accessible by both
09:05 - the users
09:07 - so this is the benefit of like group
09:08 - command like you can
09:12 - you don't have to share that file with
09:14 - each and every user suppose there there
09:16 - is a team of 50 members okay so
09:19 - you you you can't like you can't just
09:23 - share those files to all those 50 people
09:26 - separately okay so that's why we have
09:29 - this group command change group
09:31 - ownership and just
09:34 - like that file will be accessible by
09:36 - each and every group member
09:39 - so guys that's all for today's video

Cleaned transcript:

now in this particular video we are going to cover about a ch group command it basically means the change group or you can say the change group ownership okay from one group to another okay to understand this uh command just think like a basic scenario suppose there is there are the two teams in a company that is the one for our tester and another for the you can say uh like developer okay uh suppose uh tester wants to share uh one file or to some other group members that is uh they these are some kind of group members okay so uh not for a particular member of that group but this stem tester team wants to share those files to all the groups so in this scenario we can easily use this ch group command okay so in this kind of scene it will be helpful because you don't have to share that file to one particular user okay so that if you share that file or change the ownership from from file to that group so every member of that particular you group can easily access the you can easily access that particular file okay so to understand this scenario first what we will need to do we will first need to create a group okay i hope it is visible to you guys uh so to add groups what is the command so the command is nothing but the group add and group name okay so what we will do group add and let's make a group name as a developers permission and because we have not used sudo uh sorry i haven't a wrong password i think yeah group has been created uh now what i will do i will just uh create two users add user user one again we have to use sudo password no extra information i have to draw it yes user1 is added user 2 test test yes both the user has been created now what we have to do we have to just uh add those two users into the developer group okay so how you can add those two users into the developer group so for that also we have a particular command that is a user modification so i will use sudo user mod hyphen a and uh we use i think hyphen g and the group name is developers and the name of the user that is a user user one and user two i hope it should work again not working user one if i provide i added and again user two okay so groups has been added uh these two users have been added to the developer group to check what you can do gtent and group okay so here you can see user1 and user2 and in developers we have two users that is user1 and user2 okay so uh now what we have to do uh i will create a one file with our root user so first of all what i will do i will change my like switch to the root user i will go move back to directory in ls okay we have file.txt i will first remove file.txt and test okay both are you now what we have to do i will create one file that is touch file dot txt okay so if i will change check the permissions for this particular file so here you can see we have root root the user is root and the group is also root user so in this case what we have to do we have to just change the group ownership not user like this one if we have to change this group ownership to some other users or to some other group so but in this case here you can see in the permission we have the group has only read permission okay so now what we can do we can change the group from root to which group that is a developer group so for this we have a command that is ch group so how you can do it ch group ch grp and the group name is developers okay developers and then whatever we have to just provide the file name okay now i will do a less hyphen and file.txt and here you can see the group name has been changed from root to developers okay so now what i will do i will login using uh both the user su user1 and i will enter the password test and again one more terminal i will open up here like this i will increase the font size so it should be visible to you and seo which use it that was user 2 okay and again enter the password same thing move back here also the same thing i will do i will move back one directory and i will do ls hyphen l and file.txt and here you can see developers and again here developers okay uh wait a minute um what key i just entered yeah lsi final file.txt okay so here you can see in both the scenario we are getting developer as a group okay so now what i as a user one i will try to like change the some file content file.txt and here you can see it is showing me permission denied why it is showing permission denied because here you can see we have not added any kind of permission he has just read permissions okay so now what we can do okay so we have only the read permission here for the groups okay so if i will just try to access so i can just only read this file.txt but if i want to uh add some kind of text or add something in that particular file so here you can see the permission is denied so now what we will need to do we will need to just add permission for the groups for that particular file okay so how we can do it using the chmod command just because uh we don't have put uh like execute permission to the groups that's why we are getting this error so chmod or what you can do for group g plus i will do uh write and execute and i will remove the read permission uh for others and the file name that is file.txt and done and now in this case i will just say check so here you can see uh read write execute has been added for groups and read has been removed from for others okay and the group is developers as we performed earlier so now what we can do uh if i will try to access this file that file file.txt so now let's try for user one i will remove all those things so cat file.txt so here you can see i will just hi this line has been entered by user one ctrl d to save and again here also uh i will i will here i will try to access this file sorry file.txt and here you can see that line i'm getting and for user 2 also i will try to enter some line with respect to user 2 that is hi this line has been added by user 2. ctrl t to save and again i will try to access so let's access by user1 not user on its file.txt and here you can see both the lines has been added and it is accessible by both the users so this is the benefit of like group command like you can you don't have to share that file with each and every user suppose there there is a team of 50 members okay so you you you can't like you can't just share those files to all those 50 people separately okay so that's why we have this group command change group ownership and just like that file will be accessible by each and every group member so guys that's all for today's video
