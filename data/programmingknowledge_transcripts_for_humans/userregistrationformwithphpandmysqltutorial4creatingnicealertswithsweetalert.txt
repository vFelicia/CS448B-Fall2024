00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge and this is the
00:05 - fourth video on the five-part video
00:07 - series and now to create user
00:08 - registration form in PHP so in the
00:12 - previous tutorial we have learned how to
00:14 - implement or insert values coming from
00:19 - this form into database and in this
00:23 - tutorial we're going to learn how to
00:26 - implement jQuery and the sweet alert to
00:30 - replace our traditional feedback so as
00:34 - you can see if you try to implement or
00:36 - if we try to click on or type in
00:40 - different values here so email address
00:44 - comm phone number password and then
00:49 - click on sign up so we have the
00:51 - traditional feedback here successfully
00:56 - saved which is I think not that
00:58 - intuitive so we're going to implement
01:02 - the sweet alert to replace this
01:05 - traditional feedback and instead of
01:08 - inserting the values to the database
01:11 - using PHP we're going to use the power
01:14 - of jQuery to help us insert values to
01:19 - the database without reloading the page
01:22 - ok so first thing we're gonna need is to
01:26 - search for the jQuery library okay so we
01:35 - could click on or either on this links
01:39 - but let's try this the first link jQuery
01:43 - and click on the download ok so here we
01:52 - could actually see all the options that
01:58 - we have for jQuery or for including to
02:01 - Jacob to our project so accordingly we
02:04 - can just use the CDN for our jQuery
02:11 - they're also option here to just use the
02:14 - CDN or are the CDN is coming from some
02:17 - reputable companies such as Google and
02:21 - Microsoft or they're hosting also be
02:24 - jQuery so for now let's use this Google
02:28 - CDN so open this by clicking on this
02:32 - link okay so we could just copy this
02:37 - snippet for three point X or for jQuery
02:43 - version 3 point something so just copy
02:46 - the script and let's go back to our
02:48 - registration data HP and before the
02:52 - closing of the body tag let's paste the
02:54 - script and below this line let's test
02:58 - our jQuery if it's working or not so
03:04 - dollar sign and then function and close
03:10 - parentheses and open closed curly braces
03:12 - semicolon at the end and first let's
03:16 - just alert something for the document
03:21 - ready event so hello say registration
03:26 - that page me and go back to our browser
03:29 - and let's go to our user accounts in
03:37 - registration than PHP so we have the
03:44 - basic alert or JavaScript alert that
03:48 - says hello so I think the jQuery library
03:52 - is working so the next step will be to
03:56 - include another library which is the
03:58 - sweet alert so sweet alert will replace
04:02 - this JavaScript alert pop-up so let's
04:12 - search for sweet alert
04:20 - okay so sweet alert actually there are
04:24 - two versions with a sweet over and then
04:27 - the sweet alert - which is a newer
04:32 - version in DoD than the first one so
04:37 - sweet alert - is a beautiful responsive
04:40 - customisable accessible replacement for
04:43 - JavaScript pop-up boxes so they have
04:46 - here embarrassin between the normal
04:48 - alert and sweet pallor it - so first
04:52 - let's shout the normal alert by clicking
04:56 - on this button this is the native pop
05:00 - coming from the JavaScript and the
05:04 - second one shallow success message
05:06 - message so this is the suite under - so
05:14 - as you can see this is much much more
05:16 - better than the javascript native pop-up
05:20 - alert so let's go ahead and integrate
05:24 - this sweet honor to Tor project so go to
05:29 - insulation shine and we just have to
05:33 - grab the CDN coming from the J's dog
05:39 - deliver so all we have to do is copy
05:42 - this script or snippet and we just have
05:45 - to paste it below the jQuery library
05:49 - that we have integrated earlier okay and
05:52 - now instead of this alert we need to
05:56 - call on the sweet alert - and then fire
06:03 - and of course we need to view or define
06:07 - few things here which are the title a
06:11 - title would be hello world and text will
06:19 - be this is
06:26 - [Music]
06:27 - from 332 and the pipe will be success so
06:42 - let's try this
06:43 - go ahead save our file and go back to
06:47 - our browser and refresh our user
06:50 - registration or registration dot PHP
06:53 - okay so as you can see we have here a
06:56 - better and much cleaner pop-up which is
07:01 - coming from the street alert - so in
07:03 - real world this is from street alert to
07:06 - library okay now the next step is to
07:11 - include or to actually work on the
07:16 - jQuery so it would help us to insert
07:19 - values coming from coming from our form
07:22 - and insert it into the database let's go
07:28 - ahead and make some changes to our
07:30 - registration that PHP so in our form we
07:34 - have the submit button which is designer
07:38 - right so instead let's define an ID for
07:44 - this one or let us say register and
07:50 - inside here let us type in any register
07:58 - if it's click ok this should be function
08:13 - close here and inside this let's try the
08:21 - sweet alert a bit working or not so
08:24 - let's just check the sweet alert or once
08:29 - we click the button the submit button
08:32 - the sweetener should appear
08:36 - okay so for now save your file and go
08:41 - back to our browser and refresh our page
08:46 - and let's try to click on this sign up
08:49 - button okay so we have here these in
08:54 - alert so it means that the script that
08:56 - we're working on is working okay so
09:02 - before that let's set this aside for now
09:09 - because our primary concern is the value
09:13 - is coming from this form okay so let's
09:20 - add some IDs to this field so first name
09:28 - let's just copy this first name last
09:33 - name email phone number and password so
09:41 - this will be last name of course email
09:46 - and phone number and this one is for
09:52 - password so inside here at the function
09:56 - we need to declare a variable for our
10:00 - first name okay and then let's get the
10:07 - value by using the Val method and
10:13 - specify our ID for first name so copy
10:19 - and paste last name email address phone
10:23 - number password one two three four five
10:27 - so this will be for nesting and this is
10:34 - for email third one the fourth one is
10:39 - for phone number and of course for the
10:44 - password okay that's in dead
10:50 - so it should be readable so at this
11:05 - point we could actually perform a
11:09 - validation to these values right so
11:11 - first name last name email phone number
11:13 - password in so on but as you can
11:18 - remember as you can probably remember
11:20 - that we defined a required attribute or
11:24 - fields so so we can be assured that the
11:27 - values are not empty but we could also
11:30 - check for validity of our values so bar
11:35 - is valid equals this that for the check
11:45 - validity okay so we're just gonna check
11:50 - if the valid variable is true if it's
11:55 - true let's try to alert true and else
12:04 - false and we need to supply a parameter
12:12 - here and inside the valid is true
12:17 - condition we should prevent the poor
12:25 - from submitting because we want to use
12:30 - the jQuery submit instead of the
12:33 - traditional submit of d4 so I think
12:37 - that's it for this tutorial
12:39 - and we will continue implementing this
12:42 - in our last video of this five-part
12:47 - video series on how to create user
12:50 - registration form in PHP thanks
13:01 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is the fourth video on the fivepart video series and now to create user registration form in PHP so in the previous tutorial we have learned how to implement or insert values coming from this form into database and in this tutorial we're going to learn how to implement jQuery and the sweet alert to replace our traditional feedback so as you can see if you try to implement or if we try to click on or type in different values here so email address comm phone number password and then click on sign up so we have the traditional feedback here successfully saved which is I think not that intuitive so we're going to implement the sweet alert to replace this traditional feedback and instead of inserting the values to

in real world this is from street alert to library okay now the next step is to include or to actually work on the jQuery so it would help us to insert values coming from coming from our form and insert it into the database let's go ahead and make some changes to our registration that PHP so in our form we have the submit button which is designer right so instead let's define an ID for this
