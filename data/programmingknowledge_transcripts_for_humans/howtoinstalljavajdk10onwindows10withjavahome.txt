00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - that Java JDK 10 on your Windows 10
00:06 - operating system so let's get started
00:09 - and let's see how we can do it so first
00:11 - of all go to your favorite browser and
00:13 - search for Java JDK 10 and the first
00:16 - link which will appear here will be from
00:18 - Oracle comm and the heading here will
00:22 - say Java SE development kit then so just
00:26 - click on that link I'm going to give you
00:28 - the link in the description for this
00:32 - website so you can directly click on
00:34 - that link and you can directly go to
00:38 - this website in here just click I agree
00:42 - and in here you will see Java SE
00:45 - development kit 10 downloads if you want
00:48 - to see more you can go to overview and
00:51 - you will be able to get some more
00:55 - information about Java in general and
00:59 - about this version so once again I'm
01:02 - going to click on download and in the
01:05 - download section I will click on this
01:07 - Java download button which says Java
01:10 - platform JDK 10 and this will also
01:13 - redirect to the same page which will be
01:16 - linked in the description so in here
01:19 - what we need to do is we need to choose
01:22 - the version we want to install which is
01:24 - for Windows so I'm going to just check
01:27 - this radio button first of all accept
01:30 - license terms and conditions and then
01:32 - choose the last option which says
01:33 - windows 64 bin dot exe file and once you
01:38 - click on this exe file it's around 390
01:42 - megabyte file so it will take some time
01:45 - to download so I'm going to just wait
01:48 - for the download to complete so the
01:50 - download of this JDK 10.0 point 1
01:54 - windows x64 Ben dot exe file is complete
01:57 - so I'm going to double click on this
01:59 - executable file and I'm going to
02:01 - minimize by a browser now the first step
02:04 - is you will see this kind of warning you
02:06 - just need to say yes here and now you
02:08 - can see the setup wizard for this Java C
02:11 - devil
02:12 - and kit10 has been started so in here
02:15 - it's really straightforward so you just
02:17 - need to click Next here and on the next
02:20 - window you will see the installation
02:22 - part where Java JDK will be installed so
02:26 - it will be installed in your C directory
02:28 - and then in a sitter directory Program
02:30 - Files and then there will be a Java
02:33 - directory created and then inside the
02:36 - Java directory there will be a JDK 10.0
02:40 - point one will be created so if you
02:43 - don't have the good reason to change it
02:44 - you just need to leave it as default and
02:47 - I'm going to click Next here and this is
02:49 - going to start the installation process
02:51 - now in the middle of the installation
02:54 - you will see this kind of custom setup
02:57 - window so here you will see the path of
03:00 - the JRE directory so JRE stands for Java
03:04 - runtime environment and this will be the
03:07 - location of the JRE directory so if you
03:11 - don't have the good reason to change it
03:12 - just leave it as default and this
03:15 - checkbox which says enable Java content
03:18 - in the browser I think this is not going
03:21 - to harm us so I'm going to just leave it
03:23 - as default and I'm going to just click
03:25 - on the next button and this will start
03:28 - the installation of Java you can see
03:31 - installing Java and now I can see this
03:34 - message which says Java SE development
03:37 - kit 10 is successfully installed so I'm
03:40 - going to just close this window and now
03:42 - I'm going to verify the location of Java
03:45 - JDK first of all so I'm going to open my
03:47 - folder Explorer and then I'm going to go
03:50 - to the C and in here I'm going to go to
03:52 - the Program Files directory and in here
03:55 - you will see the Java directory which is
03:57 - created by this Installer and here you
04:00 - will see our two directories one is jdk
04:03 - 10.0 point one which is the version of
04:06 - java jdk and other is JRE directory
04:10 - which is java runtime environment now in
04:13 - the next step what we are going to do is
04:15 - we are going to set the environment
04:17 - variable for the Java JDK and JRE so
04:22 - that the Java commands we
04:25 - we'll be recognized by your command line
04:27 - or terminal so let's do that so what you
04:31 - need to do is you just need to go inside
04:33 - your JDK directory and then go inside
04:37 - the bin directory and then you need to
04:39 - copy this part up to bin directory
04:42 - inside the JDK directory and then right
04:46 - click on your window icon here so right
04:48 - click on the window icon and then choose
04:51 - the control panel option from here now
04:54 - once the control panel is open you just
04:56 - need to click on system and security
04:57 - option and in the systems and security
05:00 - you just need to choose the system
05:02 - option here so just click on system and
05:04 - once this system is open you just need
05:07 - to click on the advanced system settings
05:10 - on the left hand side so I'm going to
05:12 - click on advanced system settings and
05:13 - once this system settings window is open
05:16 - you just need to click on environment
05:18 - variable and in the environment variable
05:21 - window you will see under system
05:23 - variables a variable called path so you
05:27 - just need to double click on this and in
05:29 - here you just need to click new and then
05:32 - paste the path you have copied so we
05:35 - have copied C program files and then
05:39 - Java and then jdk 10.0 point 1 up to bin
05:44 - directory right so we have seen we have
05:47 - copied this part from here and we just
05:50 - need to copy it here ok same we will do
05:55 - for the JRE directory so I'm going to go
05:57 - to the Java directory once again and
05:59 - this time I'm going to go to the JRE
06:02 - directory and then the bin directory and
06:04 - then copy the path up to bin and then
06:08 - once again add a new variable and then
06:11 - paste it here so we have pasted the JDK
06:15 - bin directory and we have pasted the
06:18 - part of the JRE bin directory and now
06:22 - I'm going to click ok so this is going
06:24 - to set the Java environment variables
06:29 - for your Windows 10 operating system now
06:32 - let's also set the Java home environment
06:35 - variable so for setting the Java home
06:38 - variable and as a system variable you
06:40 - just need to click new and in here you
06:43 - just need to write Java underscore home
06:47 - and then in the variable value you just
06:50 - need to choose that JDK folder so just
06:54 - choose the JDK folder and then copy the
06:57 - path up to JDK not up to Ben but up to
07:02 - JDK folder and then paste this part here
07:06 - and then click OK which is going to add
07:09 - this environment variable in your
07:12 - Windows operating system and now we are
07:15 - going to just click OK okay and then we
07:18 - are going to close this window now in
07:21 - order to verify if Java is installed
07:23 - perfectly on your system and environment
07:25 - variables are also working fine we just
07:29 - need to open the terminal so we are
07:31 - going to just right click on the windows
07:33 - icon and now I'm going to open the
07:36 - command prompt and this is going to open
07:38 - the command prompt and once the command
07:41 - prompt opens you just need to write this
07:43 - command Java - version and then press
07:48 - Enter which is going to give you the
07:50 - version of Java which is installed on
07:52 - your system and in the result you will
07:54 - see the Java version which is 10.0 point
07:57 - 1 this is the version we have installed
07:59 - and also the Java SE runtime environment
08:03 - version also you can see build 10.0
08:06 - point 1 so this version is also 10.0
08:09 - point 1 so if you see this message then
08:11 - Java is working fine on your system this
08:15 - Java command is recognized and in order
08:18 - to verify once again you can give this
08:21 - command Java C c'mon so Java C and then
08:26 - press ENTER and if you see this kind of
08:30 - long output then it means Java C command
08:33 - is also working fine on your windows
08:35 - operating system this Java C command is
08:37 - the command to compile your java program
08:40 - so you can see the usage tip is also
08:44 - given here so Java C then you give your
08:47 - options to compile and the source file
08:50 - which is the Java source file
08:52 - so if you see this kind of output then
08:54 - Java is installed on your system and
08:56 - it's working perfectly fine so I hope
