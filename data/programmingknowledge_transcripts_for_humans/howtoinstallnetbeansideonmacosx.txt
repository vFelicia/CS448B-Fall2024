00:11 - NetBeans IDE is to have Java installed
00:15 - on your Mac OS X operating system so
00:18 - first you need to make sure that you
00:20 - have already installed Java on your Mac
00:24 - operating system now the simple check to
00:27 - test that Java is already installed is
00:30 - by going to the system preferences so
00:34 - just click this item which is for System
00:37 - Preferences or just go at the top and
00:40 - click on the Apple icon and then you can
00:43 - open the System Preferences from there
00:45 - also now in the system preferences you

00:51 - icon and this means that Java is already
00:54 - installed on your Mac operating system
00:56 - and if it's not you need to install it
00:59 - first and then follow this video to
01:02 - install NetBeans now I have already made
01:06 - a video on how to install Java on your

01:59 - download with different features so you
02:02 - have the NetBeans IDE with Java SE
02:07 - support or Java EE support or if you
02:10 - just want to develop some
02:12 - HTML and JavaScript code you can just
02:17 - download this version or NetBeans so PHP
02:21 - on NetBeans for C++ and C only or if you
02:26 - are not sure and if you want to download
02:28 - this NetBeans IDE for all the languages
02:33 - supported then you can choose the last
02:36 - option right so it includes of
02:39 - everything including C++ PHP HTML Java

02:55 - you can see the size of this file will
02:58 - be 277 megabyte right and you can see

03:25 - and once this dot dmg file is downloaded
03:30 - we are going to see how to install it
03:32 - and we will also see how we can write
03:35 - our first Java code with this NetBeans
03:40 - IDE
03:41 - so the download of this dmg file is
03:43 - complete so you just need to double
03:45 - click on this dmg file wherever you have
03:48 - downloaded it and I am going to minimize

03:56 - kind of window for you right so it's
03:59 - going to open this window and there is
04:02 - one icon here which is for NetBeans
04:05 - eight-point whatever version you have
04:08 - downloaded dot pkg file so what you need
04:11 - to do is you just need to double click
04:13 - on this pkg file which is going to start
04:16 - the NetBeans installer for you
04:19 - ok and for the first time it will say
04:21 - this package will run a program to
04:24 - determine if
04:26 - software can be installed so you can
04:28 - just press Continue here and then you
04:31 - just need to press continue button here
04:34 - on this install NetBeans windows so just
04:37 - press Continue once again and now the
04:39 - second step is to read the license terms
04:43 - and condition and agree with them so
04:46 - just see the license terms and condition
04:49 - and then click continue and then you
04:53 - just need to click agree and then the
04:58 - installation step will come so it's a
05:02 - standard install on macintosh HD and you
05:06 - just need to click install here right
05:09 - and here you just need to give your Mac
05:13 - OSX password so this is the password for
05:16 - your computer whatever is the password
05:18 - of your computer you just need to give
05:20 - it and then press install software which
05:24 - is going to start installing NetBeans on
05:27 - your Mac operating system it's going to
05:29 - take few seconds to install this IDE and
05:34 - once it's installed we are going to see
05:37 - how we can run it ok and in the end you
05:40 - will be able to see this message which
05:42 - says the installation was successful so
05:46 - NetBeans IDE is successfully installed
05:48 - on your Mac OS X operating system and
05:52 - now we need to run it so I'm going to
05:54 - close these windows here and I can go to
05:59 - the launchpad
06:00 - I can click the launchpad and search for
06:03 - NetBeans I can see directly NetBeans
06:05 - icon here but if you don't see this
06:08 - NetBeans icon then you can search for
06:10 - NetBeans and you will be able to find it
06:13 - you see and you just need to
06:15 - double-click NetBeans from here and it's
06:19 - going to start NetBeans for the first
06:21 - time and you can see NetBeans has been
06:25 - started and this is how NetBeans slows
06:31 - on your Mac OS X operating system right
06:33 - so let's create our first java
06:37 - application using and NetBeans so I'm
06:39 - going to just
06:40 - go to file here so go at the top and
06:43 - click file and then click new project
06:47 - and in here we are going to create the
06:49 - java application so in the category
06:51 - choose Java and then the project use the
06:55 - java application okay so java and java
06:58 - application and then click Next
07:01 - as going to activate the java @e and
07:06 - once it's done you can give the name to
07:10 - your java project for example this is
07:12 - our hallo world project so i'm going to
07:15 - name it as hello world and this is the
07:19 - location where you can save your project
07:21 - by default its user power slash whatever
07:25 - you your username forward slash NetBeans
07:27 - project and if you want to change it you
07:30 - can browse the directory in which you
07:33 - want to save your project I will leave
07:35 - it as default because it's our first
07:37 - hello world project and then the project
07:40 - folder is this one I will leave it as
07:43 - default also and then in the next step
07:46 - you can see use dedicated folder for
07:50 - storing libraries we don't need it and
07:52 - then the last option here says create
07:55 - main class right so we need the main
07:59 - class for this so leave this as checked
08:02 - and we just need to click finish here
08:04 - it's going to create our project and
08:07 - once the project is created we will be
08:10 - able to see our project so our project
08:13 - has been created you can see and I can
08:15 - see this HelloWorld dot Java here and
08:20 - this is our project so you can just open
08:24 - it it contains source packages directory
08:27 - and the libraries directory here so here
08:31 - is your HelloWorld package and in the
08:36 - hollow world package you have this
08:37 - HelloWorld dot Java file which is open
08:40 - here right and this has already created
08:42 - a HelloWorld class for us and it has
08:47 - already created this public static void
08:50 - main
08:51 - third for us right if you know Java is
08:54 - all about classes and main method is the
08:57 - main entry point for your program
09:00 - so let's print something let's say we
09:03 - want to print hello world so I'm going
09:05 - to just write system dot out dot print
09:10 - line okay so just write print Ln for
09:15 - print line right and in the brackets you
09:18 - just need to give double quotes and then
09:20 - you can just write hello world okay and
09:24 - then save your program by pressing this
09:27 - Save button right and in order to run it
09:31 - you can run it from here by clicking
09:33 - this green button and before running you
09:37 - just need to build your program and this
09:39 - is the icon for building your project
09:42 - right you can also press f11 to build
09:45 - your project and if you go to your
09:49 - project and right click on your Java
09:52 - file then also you can run this file
09:56 - from here okay so first I am going to
09:59 - click this button which is for building
10:01 - the project which is this hammer button
10:04 - and it's going to build the project and
10:07 - once the project is built we are going
10:10 - to just run it okay so let's run it so
10:15 - I'm going to just press this green
10:17 - button to run the project it's going to
