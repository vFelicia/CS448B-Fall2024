00:25 - okay and already the python installed in
00:28 - our Ubuntu PC okay
00:29 - this machine so these are the two things
00:31 - we will perform and let's start the
00:34 - implementation part so we will we will
00:36 - use this W get command and some of the
00:38 - options the common option is use hyphen
00:41 - M but it is not suitable to browse that
00:44 - downloaded website locally so
00:45 - additionally we use some other options
00:47 - that is hyphen K and hyphen P option
00:51 - also to browse those website locally in
00:54 - an easy way okay and it downloads the
00:56 - website in a particular format you can
00:58 - select that
00:59 - okay
01:00 - so I have already selected this
01:02 - particular website you can see uh this
01:05 - is a quite a good website and this is
01:07 - nothing but a free template from I've
01:09 - got this from this html.design slash
