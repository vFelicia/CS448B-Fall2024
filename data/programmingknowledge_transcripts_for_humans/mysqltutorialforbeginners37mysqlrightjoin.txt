00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this photo we will see how
00:05 - to use right chain as I said in our
00:09 - previous videos we can use right zone to
00:13 - fetch the matching babies from
00:15 - pocketable as well as all the records
00:17 - that are present in MySQL - you wrote -
00:33 - P password so databases here we have
00:44 - detached database here we just used that
00:54 - now which are the tables present in our
00:58 - database we have department table and a
01:03 - protocol let me first show you me chart
01:06 - the records present in employee table
01:14 - here we have three columns ID which is
01:18 - the primary name of template and the
01:21 - department ID in which they belong now
01:26 - select star from department so
01:31 - department has two columns Department
01:33 - IDs and Department name the first
01:37 - department ID belongs to IT department
01:40 - and the second department ID belongs to
01:43 - HR department now I want the matching
01:49 - values from both the tables it means I
01:53 - want the name of the employees which are
01:56 - belonging to first department and the
01:59 - second department and I also want all
02:02 - the records present in the second table
02:05 - which is the department level so select
02:11 - I want ID name and department ID from
02:21 - the department table so I write
02:23 - department dot dividing and I also want
02:29 - department name employ then I provide
02:36 - joint then I write I join the name of
02:55 - the other table department oh now we
03:00 - specify the relationship in this
03:03 - department at is common between two
03:05 - tables so we write
03:14 - you
03:16 - if I went dot dividing it means that it
03:22 - gives us the records whenever it will
03:25 - match department ID from the inflatable
03:28 - with the department ID from the bottom
03:31 - and it will also give all the records
03:35 - present at the second table which is in
03:37 - this case departmental can we have
03:47 - spelling mistake and select ok as you
03:59 - can see it gives us the records which
04:03 - are matched with motor tables as well as
04:06 - it will gives us all the records present
04:09 - in the department I think and so this is
04:16 - how you can use write join and as we
04:20 - have used in our earlier queries we can
04:22 - also use their life and for other
04:27 - operators so let me just close this open
04:33 - - Calvert
04:50 - as you can see we have our query here
04:54 - I just tried write join and when the
05:01 - Parmenides book and let me just fire and
05:04 - you can see because all the records from
05:08 - the right hand side table if we do not
05:11 - specify where condition but because we
05:14 - have specified
