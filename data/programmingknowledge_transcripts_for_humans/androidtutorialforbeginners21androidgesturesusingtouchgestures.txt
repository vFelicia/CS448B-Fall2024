00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how gestures Works in Android so there
00:11 - are some common gestures like tab double
00:15 - tab scroll
00:17 - fling long press and other gestures
00:21 - which can be used with uh our Android
00:25 - screen and let's see how uh you know
00:28 - these uh gesture events work and we will
00:32 - see how we can uh call these function to
00:36 - you know record these
00:39 - gestures so first of all I have this
00:41 - blank project and in here what I'm going
00:43 - to do is I'm going to take a long text
00:47 - and drag and drop here okay now what I'm
00:50 - going to do is I'm going to go to my
00:54 - Java folder and in here main jav main
00:57 - activity. Java file and and in here
01:00 - first of all I'm going to add some
01:04 - libraries for
01:06 - gesture so I'm going to add these three
01:09 - libraries the library names are import
01:13 - android. viw do motion event first is
01:18 - this second is
01:20 - import android.
01:23 - gesture. gesture okay and the third
01:27 - library is import static
01:31 - android. view. gesture.
01:35 - ASX now once you have uh imported all
01:38 - these classes we will Implement uh this
01:41 - gesture detector interface to our class
01:45 - so this is our class which is public
01:48 - class main activity which extends or uh
01:52 - inherits action bar activity and in here
01:55 - we will
01:57 - Implement
01:58 - so
02:00 - implements and what we are going to
02:02 - implement is one is uh the gesture
02:08 - listener so
02:10 - gesture
02:13 - dot gesture listener so on gesture
02:17 - listener and the second we are going to
02:21 - uh add
02:23 - is gesture detector
02:28 - dot tab
02:30 - double tap listener okay so once you add
02:35 - or Implement these two uh interfaces to
02:39 - your uh class uh you will be able to see
02:42 - some kind of squiggly red line which
02:45 - shows that uh this um method or this
02:49 - interface uh has some uh you know
02:53 - classes or functions which are not
02:56 - implemented okay so just click on this
02:59 - red bulb here you will be able to see
03:02 - this red bulb and just click here or Alt
03:06 - Enter and in here just click the first
03:11 - uh option which is Implement methods
03:14 - okay so click Implement
03:17 - methods and in here uh this box will
03:20 - show you all the method related to this
03:25 - uh gesture detector on double tab listen
03:28 - now which is on single tap confirm on
03:32 - double tap confirm on double tap event
03:35 - so these are the three events which are
03:37 - included through uh on double tab
03:40 - listener and some of the method are
03:44 - included through on just a listener also
03:48 - which are on down on show press on
03:51 - single tab on scroll on long and on
03:55 - fling these are all the gesture methods
03:59 - uh so each uh you know method uh is
04:03 - related to one gesture okay so just uh
04:07 - click okay and you will be able to see
04:11 - all the gestures uh gesture methods will
04:14 - be automatically included in your uh you
04:19 - know class okay so these are some of the
04:23 - common gestures okay now what we are
04:27 - going to do is first of all we will
04:29 - declare
04:30 - uh these uh variables one is our uh text
04:34 - view
04:40 - variable and other method is
04:45 - private gesture detector
04:48 - combat uh which detects the gesture and
04:52 - then we will declare the instance of it
04:54 - for
04:57 - example gesture
05:01 - the detect okay and you know it will
05:07 - show uh error because we need to include
05:10 - this Library so just click uh Alt Enter
05:15 - and import the class okay so now the
05:19 - class is imported which is uh this class
05:22 - android. support. V4 do view. gesture
05:26 - detector compad okay this class is
05:30 - imported now uh we will cast uh this
05:34 - text view first in our on create
05:42 - method and we will also create an
05:46 - instance of this gesture detect
05:49 - instance okay so in
05:54 - here
05:56 - so gesture detect is equal to to
06:01 - new gesture detector compat and this
06:06 - Constructor takes two arguments and
06:10 - these arguments are if you can just see
06:14 - here these arguments are the context and
06:17 - on gesture listener so both we will
06:20 - Define as this so the context is this
06:25 - class itself okay and once again we will
06:29 - use this instance and we will
06:33 - set set double tap listener to this
06:37 - gesture detect and the context will be
06:40 - this for this also okay now what we are
06:44 - going to do is uh let's uh use this text
06:50 - view to show uh the method which is
06:53 - called so for example we uh you know uh
06:58 - add or we perform some gesture for
07:01 - example double tap or show press or
07:06 - onscroll you know gesture this method or
07:10 - these method will be called whenever we
07:13 - uh you know perform any gesture on our
07:16 - Android screen okay so what we want to
07:20 - do is we want to print which method is
07:23 - called in this uh text view so just copy
07:26 - this text view variable from here and
07:29 - just go little bit down and for each
07:33 - method which is created by these gesture
07:37 - listener and on double tap
07:40 - listener we will add one method to each
07:44 - uh you know one you know uh text view to
07:49 - each uh method okay so text view dot set
07:55 - text and inside this uh meth method or
08:00 - as an argument of this set text we will
08:02 - pass the name of the method simply okay
08:06 - so we know that which method is called
08:10 - and it will be printed in this text box
08:12 - the same thing I'm going to do for all
08:16 - the method so on double
08:28 - tab
08:35 - so we have just added uh the set text
08:38 - method to the text view so that we can
08:40 - print the method called on the text view
08:47 - okay you can even call these motion
08:51 - event uh method in your text uh set text
08:57 - view okay so for examp example I want to
09:01 - add the you know motion event for this I
09:05 - can just add a concatenation operator E
09:09 - dot2 string okay and this what it's
09:13 - going to do is it's going to print the
09:16 - you know motion event uh string here so
09:20 - you can add this to you know every
09:23 - method but uh you know it's not
09:27 - necessary but you can do it to get the
09:29 - extra information about your uh you know
09:33 - method which is called okay same you can
09:37 - do for onscroll E1 and
09:41 - E2 and you can call e1. two string plus
09:46 - E2 do2
09:49 - string okay so E2 do2 string okay same
09:55 - uh you can do for every method where
09:58 - motion event method is there okay now
10:03 - what we are going to do
10:05 - is once we have added this uh text view.
10:09 - set text uh to all these uh uh methods
10:14 - we can call or we just need to call one
10:18 - more method okay and that method is on
10:23 - touch event okay so go here just before
10:29 - the Declaration of all these method
10:32 - related to gesture detector and gesture
10:36 - on double tap listener all the methods
10:39 - are implemented here so you can call
10:42 - this method above all these method or
10:44 - below all these method it uh you know
10:46 - doesn't uh matter I'm going to add this
10:50 - U ontouch event method above all these
10:54 - method which are created by on double
10:57 - click listener and on gesture detector
11:00 - okay so in here go here and just press
11:03 - alt insert okay so just press alt plus
11:08 - insert and then you will be able to see
11:11 - uh some autogeneration code options and
11:15 - we are going to choose override method
11:18 - from here so just choose override
11:20 - methods and in here there are so many
11:24 - methods and the method we are uh
11:28 - searching for is on touch event so just
11:33 - make sure that uh this filter is set
11:35 - here from you know which adjust the
11:38 - alphabetical order so it's it will be
11:41 - easier to find this method so in here
11:45 - you just need to scroll down and if you
11:50 - don't find just uh close first two
11:53 - categories here and then search in the
11:56 - third category and search for for on
12:00 - touch event which is this event okay so
12:04 - search for on touch event here and click
12:08 - okay and this have created us this on
12:13 - touch event and inside this on touch
12:16 - event just before this return uh on
12:19 - touch event we are going to just uh use
12:23 - our gesture detector variable or gesture
12:27 - detector object which is uh an instance
12:30 - of gesture detector compat inside this
12:34 - ontouch event what I'm going to do is
12:37 - I'm going to call this gesture
12:39 - detect dot
12:45 - on do ontouch event and just pass this
12:50 - event as an argument
12:54 - okay and I think our code is ready so so
13:00 - let let's run our code now so now our
13:04 - app is running and you can see there is
13:07 - nothing uh inside our text view right
13:11 - now but once you scroll here or tab here
13:15 - or long tab here all the method will be
13:19 - recorded for example I scroll and you
13:22 - can see onscroll method is called and
13:26 - you can also see uh the D details of
13:29 - this motion detection which is uh the
13:33 - coordinates here the action perform the
13:36 - time event time and other features which
13:40 - are uh you know called by this event e
13:44 - to string right so you can scroll tab or
13:50 - fling and on fling you can see or you
13:54 - can long press or you can double click
13:58 - double tap or you know you can play with
14:03 - this uh gestures and you will be able to
14:07 - see all the methods are called one by
14:10 - one on each gesture and if you want if
14:14 - you don't want to see all this extra
14:16 - information just remove this e.2 string
14:21 - and you will just be able to see this
14:23 - method which is called so I hope uh you
14:26 - understood the basic concept of just I
14:29 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
14:30 - wait comment and subscribe and bye for

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how gestures Works in Android so there are some common gestures like tab double tab scroll fling long press and other gestures which can be used with uh our Android screen and let's see how uh you know these uh gesture events work and we will see how we can uh call these function to you know record these gestures so first of all I have this blank project and in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a long text and drag and drop here okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my Java folder and in here main jav main activity. Java file and and in here first of all I'm going to add some libraries for gesture so I'm going to add these three libraries the library names are import android. viw do motion event first is this second is import android. gesture. gesture okay and the third library is import static android. view. gesture. ASX now once you have uh imported all these classes we will Implement uh this gesture detector interface to our class so this is our class which is public class main activity which extends or uh inherits action bar activity and in here we will Implement so implements and what we are going to implement is one is uh the gesture listener so gesture dot gesture listener so on gesture listener and the second we are going to uh add is gesture detector dot tab double tap listener okay so once you add or Implement these two uh interfaces to your uh class uh you will be able to see some kind of squiggly red line which shows that uh this um method or this interface uh has some uh you know classes or functions which are not implemented okay so just click on this red bulb here you will be able to see this red bulb and just click here or Alt Enter and in here just click the first uh option which is Implement methods okay so click Implement methods and in here uh this box will show you all the method related to this uh gesture detector on double tab listen now which is on single tap confirm on double tap confirm on double tap event so these are the three events which are included through uh on double tab listener and some of the method are included through on just a listener also which are on down on show press on single tab on scroll on long and on fling these are all the gesture methods uh so each uh you know method uh is related to one gesture okay so just uh click okay and you will be able to see all the gestures uh gesture methods will be automatically included in your uh you know class okay so these are some of the common gestures okay now what we are going to do is first of all we will declare uh these uh variables one is our uh text view variable and other method is private gesture detector combat uh which detects the gesture and then we will declare the instance of it for example gesture the detect okay and you know it will show uh error because we need to include this Library so just click uh Alt Enter and import the class okay so now the class is imported which is uh this class android. support. V4 do view. gesture detector compad okay this class is imported now uh we will cast uh this text view first in our on create method and we will also create an instance of this gesture detect instance okay so in here so gesture detect is equal to to new gesture detector compat and this Constructor takes two arguments and these arguments are if you can just see here these arguments are the context and on gesture listener so both we will Define as this so the context is this class itself okay and once again we will use this instance and we will set set double tap listener to this gesture detect and the context will be this for this also okay now what we are going to do is uh let's uh use this text view to show uh the method which is called so for example we uh you know uh add or we perform some gesture for example double tap or show press or onscroll you know gesture this method or these method will be called whenever we uh you know perform any gesture on our Android screen okay so what we want to do is we want to print which method is called in this uh text view so just copy this text view variable from here and just go little bit down and for each method which is created by these gesture listener and on double tap listener we will add one method to each uh you know one you know uh text view to each uh method okay so text view dot set text and inside this uh meth method or as an argument of this set text we will pass the name of the method simply okay so we know that which method is called and it will be printed in this text box the same thing I'm going to do for all the method so on double tab so we have just added uh the set text method to the text view so that we can print the method called on the text view okay you can even call these motion event uh method in your text uh set text view okay so for examp example I want to add the you know motion event for this I can just add a concatenation operator E dot2 string okay and this what it's going to do is it's going to print the you know motion event uh string here so you can add this to you know every method but uh you know it's not necessary but you can do it to get the extra information about your uh you know method which is called okay same you can do for onscroll E1 and E2 and you can call e1. two string plus E2 do2 string okay so E2 do2 string okay same uh you can do for every method where motion event method is there okay now what we are going to do is once we have added this uh text view. set text uh to all these uh uh methods we can call or we just need to call one more method okay and that method is on touch event okay so go here just before the Declaration of all these method related to gesture detector and gesture on double tap listener all the methods are implemented here so you can call this method above all these method or below all these method it uh you know doesn't uh matter I'm going to add this U ontouch event method above all these method which are created by on double click listener and on gesture detector okay so in here go here and just press alt insert okay so just press alt plus insert and then you will be able to see uh some autogeneration code options and we are going to choose override method from here so just choose override methods and in here there are so many methods and the method we are uh searching for is on touch event so just make sure that uh this filter is set here from you know which adjust the alphabetical order so it's it will be easier to find this method so in here you just need to scroll down and if you don't find just uh close first two categories here and then search in the third category and search for for on touch event which is this event okay so search for on touch event here and click okay and this have created us this on touch event and inside this on touch event just before this return uh on touch event we are going to just uh use our gesture detector variable or gesture detector object which is uh an instance of gesture detector compat inside this ontouch event what I'm going to do is I'm going to call this gesture detect dot on do ontouch event and just pass this event as an argument okay and I think our code is ready so so let let's run our code now so now our app is running and you can see there is nothing uh inside our text view right now but once you scroll here or tab here or long tab here all the method will be recorded for example I scroll and you can see onscroll method is called and you can also see uh the D details of this motion detection which is uh the coordinates here the action perform the time event time and other features which are uh you know called by this event e to string right so you can scroll tab or fling and on fling you can see or you can long press or you can double click double tap or you know you can play with this uh gestures and you will be able to see all the methods are called one by one on each gesture and if you want if you don't want to see all this extra information just remove this e.2 string and you will just be able to see this method which is called so I hope uh you understood the basic concept of just I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for
