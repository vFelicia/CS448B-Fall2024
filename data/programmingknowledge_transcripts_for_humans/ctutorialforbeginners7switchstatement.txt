00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:05 - IFL statement in C++ in this video I'm
00:08 - going to talk about second type of
00:12 - conditional statement which is switch
00:14 - statement so let's see how we can use
00:16 - switch statement in
00:18 - C++ so I'm going to take an example
00:21 - first of all I will
00:23 - declare a variable called character and
00:27 - I name it as grade
00:30 - and then I will
00:33 - output a question to the
00:37 - user that
00:41 - please enter
00:43 - the
00:46 - grade and I
00:49 - will close this and end the
00:55 - line okay now we will wait for the user
01:00 - to input the grade so I will say c
01:04 - n insertion
01:06 - operator
01:08 - grade now on the basis of uh user
01:13 - defined grade or whatever user enters as
01:16 - a grade I want to show some message so
01:20 - let's see how I can do this with switch
01:23 - statement so what is the Declaration of
01:25 - the switch statement so you need to
01:28 - write
01:31 - switch and then these parenthesis and
01:34 - then you need to give these curly braces
01:38 - and in here inside this curly braces we
01:41 - are going to Define some cases okay but
01:44 - first of all in this curly bracket we
01:47 - provide the condition okay so our
01:50 - condition is this grade on the basis of
01:53 - this grade we are going to decide the
01:56 - message we want to show right so in here
02:00 - we write cases so just write case and
02:05 - because uh we are evaluating the
02:09 - character grade which is a character and
02:12 - character we can write it
02:16 - as like this right so if user enters
02:21 - character a then just
02:24 - give
02:26 - this colon this is not a semic but a Col
02:30 - right so remember this and then you can
02:34 - output your
02:37 - message see
02:41 - out and we can
02:48 - say excellent
02:51 - okay and end the
02:54 - line and in the same way on the basis of
02:58 - grade entered
03:00 - you can Define different cases
03:03 - but there is a optional break point in
03:07 - switch cases which you can declare it
03:10 - like
03:11 - this
03:13 - break so what this does is I will
03:15 - explain you in a moment but I will copy
03:19 - this and paste it two or three three
03:23 - times uh for different conditions so if
03:26 - the grade is B grade entered this V you
03:30 - can
03:35 - say
03:38 - very good and if the G grade entered is
03:43 - C you can show the message
03:48 - that
03:50 - you passed okay and there is
03:54 - a one more important condition in switch
03:58 - cases that doesn't fulfill uh the
04:02 - provided conditions so what happens if
04:05 - the user doesn't provide a b or c what
04:08 - happens in the case user provides some
04:11 - uh
04:13 - random character so what will happen
04:17 - then so you can just deal with that
04:19 - random character
04:22 - by
04:24 - default
04:26 - and what is a default in uh any case
04:30 - other than the case listed above you are
04:33 - going to show the
04:35 - message see
04:44 - out
04:46 - invalid entry okay so the user knows
04:52 - that he has entered a wrong entry right
04:57 - and I will just close it and and break
05:01 - I'll provide break
05:05 - here okay so now I will explain what's
05:09 - happening here so what's happening here
05:14 - is this is a switch statement so this a
05:18 - typo I made it here so switch statement
05:22 - decide on the basis of grade on the
05:26 - condition you enter or or user enters so
05:29 - it sees uh whether user has entered a b
05:34 - or c and on the basis of the provided
05:37 - condition it decide what message he want
05:41 - to print okay so let's build the program
05:46 - and run the
05:48 - program program is
05:52 - building and now let's run the program
05:55 - and for
05:57 - example I enter the gray
06:00 - a so I should ideally see this message
06:02 - excellent let's see if I get it or not I
06:05 - enter a as a grade and press enter and
06:09 - programs shows me excellent once again I
06:13 - enter the
06:15 - Grade B and press enter it says very
06:20 - good and once again if I enter some
06:24 - random random character for example D
06:29 - and press enter it says me invalid entry
06:32 - because it's not
06:34 - fulfilling these listed condition in
06:37 - case
06:39 - right now there is a unique property in
06:42 - switch cases
06:44 - that this break is optional right so for
06:49 - example I give a new case here
06:58 - case
07:00 - small
07:02 - a here okay so in the case of if the
07:07 - user enters small a I'm not providing
07:11 - any condition or any break here right so
07:16 - now what happens in this condition if I
07:18 - don't provide any break after my case
07:23 - what happens
07:24 - is it goes to this condition if user
07:27 - enters small a and and then it sees that
07:31 - if the break is there and if he finds
07:34 - the break it breaks the switch
07:36 - conditions and go out of this switch
07:39 - otherwise if the break is not found in
07:43 - this case or in this condition it goes
07:46 - to the next case
07:49 - and performs
07:52 - the conditions here Contrition here so
07:55 - which is excellent and then he sees yes
07:59 - now I find break so it goes out of this
08:03 - condition here
08:05 - so when you enter or when the user
08:08 - enters the small a
08:12 - this code will be executed which is the
08:15 - next immediate next case of the switch
08:19 - statement so let me explain or Let Me
08:23 - Show You by this example I will build
08:25 - the example
08:26 - and run the program and and for example
08:30 - I enter small a small a and I will press
08:34 - enter and you see the message comes here
08:37 - is excellent and you can ask why this
08:42 - condition is uh
08:44 - executed other than this small a
08:48 - condition because you haven't provided
08:50 - the break here so if you don't provide
08:53 - break after your condition or after the
08:56 - case it'll go and execute the
09:00 - next code or next condition okay and
09:04 - when it sees that yeah I get the break
09:08 - then it goes out of the condition so
09:11 - always remember that
09:14 - what do you want to do you want to give
09:17 - the break or you want to execute the
09:21 - next condition also okay so this is the
09:26 - thing to remember in case and always
09:30 - remember that you catch any exception
09:34 - other than cases by default okay so
09:39 - these are the two things to remember in
09:41 - switch cases I hope you have understood
09:43 - the concept of case and I hope you have
09:46 - enjoyed this video please RIT comment
09:47 - and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use IFL statement in C++ in this video I'm going to talk about second type of conditional statement which is switch statement so let's see how we can use switch statement in C++ so I'm going to take an example first of all I will declare a variable called character and I name it as grade and then I will output a question to the user that please enter the grade and I will close this and end the line okay now we will wait for the user to input the grade so I will say c n insertion operator grade now on the basis of uh user defined grade or whatever user enters as a grade I want to show some message so let's see how I can do this with switch statement so what is the Declaration of the switch statement so you need to write switch and then these parenthesis and then you need to give these curly braces and in here inside this curly braces we are going to Define some cases okay but first of all in this curly bracket we provide the condition okay so our condition is this grade on the basis of this grade we are going to decide the message we want to show right so in here we write cases so just write case and because uh we are evaluating the character grade which is a character and character we can write it as like this right so if user enters character a then just give this colon this is not a semic but a Col right so remember this and then you can output your message see out and we can say excellent okay and end the line and in the same way on the basis of grade entered you can Define different cases but there is a optional break point in switch cases which you can declare it like this break so what this does is I will explain you in a moment but I will copy this and paste it two or three three times uh for different conditions so if the grade is B grade entered this V you can say very good and if the G grade entered is C you can show the message that you passed okay and there is a one more important condition in switch cases that doesn't fulfill uh the provided conditions so what happens if the user doesn't provide a b or c what happens in the case user provides some uh random character so what will happen then so you can just deal with that random character by default and what is a default in uh any case other than the case listed above you are going to show the message see out invalid entry okay so the user knows that he has entered a wrong entry right and I will just close it and and break I'll provide break here okay so now I will explain what's happening here so what's happening here is this is a switch statement so this a typo I made it here so switch statement decide on the basis of grade on the condition you enter or or user enters so it sees uh whether user has entered a b or c and on the basis of the provided condition it decide what message he want to print okay so let's build the program and run the program program is building and now let's run the program and for example I enter the gray a so I should ideally see this message excellent let's see if I get it or not I enter a as a grade and press enter and programs shows me excellent once again I enter the Grade B and press enter it says very good and once again if I enter some random random character for example D and press enter it says me invalid entry because it's not fulfilling these listed condition in case right now there is a unique property in switch cases that this break is optional right so for example I give a new case here case small a here okay so in the case of if the user enters small a I'm not providing any condition or any break here right so now what happens in this condition if I don't provide any break after my case what happens is it goes to this condition if user enters small a and and then it sees that if the break is there and if he finds the break it breaks the switch conditions and go out of this switch otherwise if the break is not found in this case or in this condition it goes to the next case and performs the conditions here Contrition here so which is excellent and then he sees yes now I find break so it goes out of this condition here so when you enter or when the user enters the small a this code will be executed which is the next immediate next case of the switch statement so let me explain or Let Me Show You by this example I will build the example and run the program and and for example I enter small a small a and I will press enter and you see the message comes here is excellent and you can ask why this condition is uh executed other than this small a condition because you haven't provided the break here so if you don't provide break after your condition or after the case it'll go and execute the next code or next condition okay and when it sees that yeah I get the break then it goes out of the condition so always remember that what do you want to do you want to give the break or you want to execute the next condition also okay so this is the thing to remember in case and always remember that you catch any exception other than cases by default okay so these are the two things to remember in switch cases I hope you have understood the concept of case and I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
