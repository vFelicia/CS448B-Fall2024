00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I've shown you how to add
00:04 - rows to your data grid View and how to
00:06 - use your data grid view in this video
00:09 - I'm going to show you how to remove the
00:12 - selected Row from your datag grid view
00:15 - so let's get let's get started I will
00:17 - take a button from here and I will
00:20 - change its text
00:24 - as remove
00:27 - row and I will change the font size
00:32 - also to bold and
00:36 - 16 so we can see this button text okay
00:41 - now I will just double click this button
00:44 - and in here I will
00:49 - write datag
00:53 - grid view
00:57 - one okay so first of all instead of this
01:02 - data grid view one I forgot to give the
01:05 - if condition so I will write
01:09 - if my data grid view one dot so I will
01:14 - just cut it from here and instead of
01:17 - this if my datag grid view one do
01:21 - selected rows do
01:25 - count
01:27 - is greater than zero
01:31 - then and I will also provide an else
01:40 - condition okay so if my
01:44 - selected row count is greater than zero
01:48 - then I will remove the rows otherwise
01:50 - there is no rows to remove or there is
01:53 - no rows to select so I will just show
01:57 - the
01:58 - message message box
02:01 - dot
02:04 - show
02:07 - that no
02:11 - rows
02:14 - to select okay now in this if condition
02:18 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
02:21 - declare a for Loop
02:25 - for I
02:28 - as
02:33 - integer is equal to once again your
02:36 - datag grid view do
02:39 - selected rows do count minus
02:44 - 1 2 0 and we will step minus one at a
02:50 - time so we will write step
02:54 - minus1 okay and in this for Loop what we
02:58 - are going to do is
03:00 - we are going to remove the row so I will
03:03 - once again just copy this DOA grid view
03:06 - name
03:09 - dot
03:11 - rows
03:12 - dot remove at and in the bracket what we
03:17 - will give we will give the index of the
03:20 - selected rows so just copy this doag
03:23 - grid view one once again
03:27 - dot selected rows
03:30 - and we will give the index which is
03:35 - I
03:37 - dot index okay so this is the code and
03:43 - if you want you can just copy the code
03:48 - from here to here okay now let's check
03:52 - whether it's really working or not so I
03:54 - will add some random names
03:57 - first some name some
04:01 - surname and once
04:04 - again okay now I
04:07 - selected this Row from here and I want
04:10 - to remove this row so I will click
04:12 - remove row and my row is removed
04:16 - okay and for example I select this row
04:21 - and moved
04:22 - right so you can
04:25 - also remove multiple rows I selected all
04:29 - the rows and I say remove row and all
04:32 - the rows are removed or you can just
04:35 - remove the rows one by one
04:39 - okay so in this way you can remove the
04:41 - rows from datag grid View using a Visual
04:43 - Basic Windows Form application I hope
04:45 - you have enjoyed this video please rate
04:46 - comment and And subscribe and bye for
04:49 - now
