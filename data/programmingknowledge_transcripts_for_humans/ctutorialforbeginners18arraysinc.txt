00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:03 - show you how you can use arrays in C++
00:07 - so let me show you how you can declare
00:09 - array in C++ but first of all this is a
00:13 - good question what is an array an array
00:16 - is a variable which can contain more
00:20 - than one values or as the name suggest
00:23 - it can contain an array of values now
00:28 - let's see how we can declare array
00:31 - the Declaration is same as the variable
00:33 - declaration for example
00:35 - int
00:37 - my array the name of the array and then
00:41 - you need to give how much or how many
00:45 - elements the array will contain so this
00:49 - square bracket this square bracket in
00:52 - this square bracket you need to Define
00:54 - how many element this array will contain
00:57 - so for example I will Define three here
01:01 - then C++ code will know that yeah I have
01:05 - assigned the or I have place or I have
01:09 - reserved the three element array in the
01:12 - memory so it will assign three spaces in
01:16 - the memory to your array right now in
01:20 - order to initialize array or in order to
01:24 - initialize array with the values what
01:26 - you can do is uh you you can initialize
01:30 - arrays in different forms but the most
01:32 - basic form is called array initializer
01:37 - list okay so I will show you how you can
01:41 - initialize array with array initializer
01:43 - list just give equal to and then these
01:46 - curly braces and in this curly braces
01:49 - you can give the values of the array
01:52 - element by
01:53 - element now for example I will give the
01:56 - values 36 45
02:01 - 64 and we close it so this means that my
02:07 - array contains three values and the
02:10 - elements of the array or values of the
02:12 - arrays are 36 45 and 64 so these three
02:18 - values are called elements of the array
02:21 - and there is something called index of
02:23 - the array which is the position of
02:26 - element in Array and the position of
02:29 - element mement in Array starts from zero
02:32 - not from one so index of this array is
02:36 - or index of this element is zero index
02:39 - of this element is one and index of this
02:41 - element is two now in order to print
02:45 - array what you can simply do is see out
02:49 - or in order to access the value of the
02:51 - array you just copy the name of the
02:53 - array give the square bracket and give
02:56 - the index of the value you want to print
02:59 - print right so now this
03:04 - means we have given here the element
03:07 - zero we want to access the element zero
03:09 - from the array and from here we can we
03:12 - know that zero element or element with
03:16 - index zero is 36 so this should print 36
03:21 - ideally let's build the program and
03:24 - let's see what happens I'll run the
03:26 - program and it gives me 36 that's true
03:30 - now for example I want to print 64 here
03:33 - the index of 64 is 2 right so I will
03:37 - write two here build the program and run
03:41 - it and you can
03:42 - see 64 is printed here now in order to
03:47 - assign values to array in a different
03:51 - manner what you can do
03:55 - is you can just assign values like this
03:59 - so you can just copy the name of the
04:02 - array just give the square bracket give
04:06 - zero and you can provide the value of an
04:10 - ARR for example 34 in this way also you
04:13 - can initialize the element of array so
04:18 - this means that assign on the index zero
04:22 - the value 34 okay so you can do a copy
04:26 - and paste it three times and on the
04:29 - index one and on the index two we will
04:31 - assign some different
04:33 - value 45 64 and now for example I will
04:39 - run the program it will works as same as
04:42 - before you can see 64 is printed right
04:47 - now now if your array will
04:52 - contain more elements for example 10
04:56 - elements and 20 elements then you cannot
05:00 - assign your array like this and you can
05:03 - also it will be tedious for you to
05:06 - initialize your array with array
05:09 - initializer list so what you can do is
05:11 - you can initialize your array with loops
05:14 - also so how you can do it just give a
05:19 - for loop as I have shown you how to use
05:21 - for Loop and just
05:24 - declare variable int is equal
05:27 - to0 and the limit of the array for
05:30 - example my array will contain 15
05:34 - elements okay so I will initialize
05:38 - my uh I from zero because index of array
05:43 - starts from zero right and then I will
05:46 - say if I is less than or equal
05:52 - to
05:54 - 14 because this is 15 and our index
05:58 - start from
06:00 - 14 then the value will go up to 14 okay
06:03 - including 15 we have including 0 we have
06:08 - 15 values right that's why I have
06:10 - written 14 here one less than this
06:13 - because we are starting from zero and
06:16 - then I will say I ++ and then I will
06:20 - give these curly braces and in here I
06:24 - will say
06:27 - assign value of of X so I will say X not
06:32 - X but I is equal to some
06:36 - value so what you can assign for example
06:42 - 67 and in order to print this value you
06:45 - can just write C
06:52 - out
06:54 - I and then you can just give some
07:00 - string and you can just
07:03 - give you can print the I element of the
07:09 - array like this and now when I run the
07:12 - program build it and run it you see here
07:17 - it's it has assigned some values I have
07:20 - I forgot to add
07:23 - endl and line so now it will be more
07:28 - clear so when I run the
07:31 - program now you can see
07:33 - here we have assigned 67 to each and
07:37 - every value in an in the array so in
07:41 - this way also you can assign value to
07:44 - the array so I hope you have understood
07:47 - the basic concept of array how you can
07:50 - initialize array and how you can assign
07:52 - values in the array so that's it for now
07:57 - please recomended subscribe and bye for
07:59 - now

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can use arrays in C++ so let me show you how you can declare array in C++ but first of all this is a good question what is an array an array is a variable which can contain more than one values or as the name suggest it can contain an array of values now let's see how we can declare array the Declaration is same as the variable declaration for example int my array the name of the array and then you need to give how much or how many elements the array will contain so this square bracket this square bracket in this square bracket you need to Define how many element this array will contain so for example I will Define three here then C++ code will know that yeah I have assigned the or I have place or I have reserved the three element array in the memory so it will assign three spaces in the memory to your array right now in order to initialize array or in order to initialize array with the values what you can do is uh you you can initialize arrays in different forms but the most basic form is called array initializer list okay so I will show you how you can initialize array with array initializer list just give equal to and then these curly braces and in this curly braces you can give the values of the array element by element now for example I will give the values 36 45 64 and we close it so this means that my array contains three values and the elements of the array or values of the arrays are 36 45 and 64 so these three values are called elements of the array and there is something called index of the array which is the position of element in Array and the position of element mement in Array starts from zero not from one so index of this array is or index of this element is zero index of this element is one and index of this element is two now in order to print array what you can simply do is see out or in order to access the value of the array you just copy the name of the array give the square bracket and give the index of the value you want to print print right so now this means we have given here the element zero we want to access the element zero from the array and from here we can we know that zero element or element with index zero is 36 so this should print 36 ideally let's build the program and let's see what happens I'll run the program and it gives me 36 that's true now for example I want to print 64 here the index of 64 is 2 right so I will write two here build the program and run it and you can see 64 is printed here now in order to assign values to array in a different manner what you can do is you can just assign values like this so you can just copy the name of the array just give the square bracket give zero and you can provide the value of an ARR for example 34 in this way also you can initialize the element of array so this means that assign on the index zero the value 34 okay so you can do a copy and paste it three times and on the index one and on the index two we will assign some different value 45 64 and now for example I will run the program it will works as same as before you can see 64 is printed right now now if your array will contain more elements for example 10 elements and 20 elements then you cannot assign your array like this and you can also it will be tedious for you to initialize your array with array initializer list so what you can do is you can initialize your array with loops also so how you can do it just give a for loop as I have shown you how to use for Loop and just declare variable int is equal to0 and the limit of the array for example my array will contain 15 elements okay so I will initialize my uh I from zero because index of array starts from zero right and then I will say if I is less than or equal to 14 because this is 15 and our index start from 14 then the value will go up to 14 okay including 15 we have including 0 we have 15 values right that's why I have written 14 here one less than this because we are starting from zero and then I will say I ++ and then I will give these curly braces and in here I will say assign value of of X so I will say X not X but I is equal to some value so what you can assign for example 67 and in order to print this value you can just write C out I and then you can just give some string and you can just give you can print the I element of the array like this and now when I run the program build it and run it you see here it's it has assigned some values I have I forgot to add endl and line so now it will be more clear so when I run the program now you can see here we have assigned 67 to each and every value in an in the array so in this way also you can assign value to the array so I hope you have understood the basic concept of array how you can initialize array and how you can assign values in the array so that's it for now please recomended subscribe and bye for now
