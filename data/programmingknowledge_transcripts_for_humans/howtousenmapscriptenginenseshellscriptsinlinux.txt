00:00 - hello guys welcome back to the channel
00:01 - this is ayush and now in this particular
00:03 - video we will learn about uh one more
00:05 - script that we will create another
00:07 - script with the help of the nmap tool
00:10 - which we basically use for the network
00:11 - web mapping and we will look for the
00:14 - what are the open ports in the
00:15 - particular uh system using the IP
00:18 - address or the domain name okay
00:19 - so but before moving forward in this
00:22 - particular video I will uh
00:24 - talk about first about this clone
00:26 - repository sh file so we can do one more
00:29 - thing in this particular script is like
00:31 - that uh
00:33 - wait a minute
00:36 - we can just add one more thing here like
00:39 - we can check for the weather user enters
00:42 - the uh correct URL or not okay so we can
00:46 - use the concept of the like sub-str that
00:48 - is the substring we will match the sub
00:50 - string of a string okay I hope you got
00:52 - the uh concept this thing like what we
00:55 - will do we will just to match the
00:57 - substring part of the this repo link
01:00 - okay if you if it matches with the
01:03 - github.com then we can easily clone the
01:06 - Repository
01:07 - so now what we have to do I will create
01:09 - the just another variable with the name
01:12 - domain name okay
01:14 - so let me just create it
01:17 - domain name equal to github.com
01:23 - github.com okay
01:25 - and I will just need to add the
01:27 - semi-fills conditions here to check
01:30 - whether the user enters the correct link
01:33 - or not okay so here I will just do
01:36 - dollar repo link equal equal to and I
01:41 - will need to use asterisk because we use
01:45 - that for the
01:47 - substring comparison okay
01:51 - so I can do asterisk and then
01:55 - inside the double quotes I have to just
01:57 - provide the
01:59 - variable name that is the domain name
02:03 - okay
02:05 - so now what we will do
02:07 - we will basically uh
02:11 - like right for the script like then
02:17 - Eco if the link are equal then what we
02:20 - will do
02:22 - what is happening
02:27 - okay let me just copy the same thing
02:29 - again here
02:36 - Eco then we will do this else what we
02:38 - can do else we will just
02:41 - Echo
02:44 - please enter
02:46 - valid link and we will close the
02:49 - condition part here with the fee okay so
02:52 - I hope everything is correct so now what
02:55 - we will do I will just run the script
02:56 - again here so
03:00 - okay I will run the script but before
03:02 - that I will just copy this link
03:05 - okay so just paste it here and the
03:11 - terminal
03:16 - so I'll just run the script using 24
03:18 - okay clone.sh Enter the depository link
03:21 - I will enter the link
03:23 - okay so here you can see we got some
03:25 - kind of error uh
03:28 - on which line we have got line number
03:30 - 14.
03:33 - okay if repo link
03:35 - equal equal to asterisk okay we forgot
03:39 - to add space here
03:42 - Ctrl s
03:45 - clear the screen
03:47 - okay now I will just add first
03:49 - google.com so it should Pro in yeah so
03:52 - please enter valid link now I will what
03:54 - I will do I will just
03:56 - paste the
03:58 - depositor link enter so here you can see
04:00 - it is cloning into cell scripting
04:02 - tutorial and here you can see the
04:05 - directory has been created with the name
04:06 - cell scripting tutorial so uh our script
04:09 - is running uh fine because if you are
04:12 - entering some wrong URL then at that
04:14 - time we are getting the uh this
04:16 - statement is running like please enter
04:18 - valid link so it means this thing is
04:20 - getting verified okay so that was the
04:23 - part which was remaining in our previous
04:25 - video so now what I will do I will
04:28 - create one more uh script with the name
04:31 - hmm sorry let me just create it
04:35 - 25 underscore on
04:38 - nmap
04:40 - yeah we can do nmap.sh
04:42 - so now if you don't know about the nmap
04:45 - so let me tell you first about what is
04:46 - this so nvap basically one tool that we
04:49 - use for the network mapping or you can
04:51 - say like for finding the open ports in a
04:54 - particular uh system okay so that is a
04:57 - basically a cyber security tool which we
04:59 - use for for Network scanning and all
05:01 - those things we can also get the
05:03 - information about the osc okay so just
05:06 - like other commands uh like for LS we
05:09 - have L option a option so similarly for
05:11 - nmap also we have different options okay
05:14 - which we will learn in this particular
05:15 - video okay
05:17 - so let's start with the scripting part
05:19 - and let me just give you the use case
05:21 - how the thing will go on so the thing is
05:23 - basically whatever you have to read the
05:25 - host name it basically means whether you
05:28 - want to take the domain name or the IP
05:30 - address it all depends upon you what you
05:31 - want to take as an input from the user
05:34 - so you have to take the host name
05:36 - and then further what you have to do you
05:38 - have to just use the nmap commands Okay
05:43 - to just uh what we can say
05:46 - um
05:48 - to just scan that particular host name
05:51 - okay so this is the simple use case
05:53 - which we will be going to use in this
05:55 - particular video so for that first I
05:57 - will need to enter the uh take the input
06:00 - from the user that is the host name okay
06:03 - so let me first clear the screen and now
06:06 - I will just
06:09 - Eco okay wait a minute what's what is
06:12 - happening which key is
06:16 - I think some keys are
06:18 - okay wait a minute
06:19 - [Music]
06:21 - some keys are placed automatically
06:26 - wait a minute yeah I think now it's not
06:29 - happened nothing is happening sorry for
06:31 - that so now what I will do eco
06:33 - enter the
06:35 - host name okay but before that let me
06:38 - show you the how the thing is work okay
06:41 - the actual thing works okay so let me
06:44 - just search for the nmap
06:47 - okay
06:49 - so you will get the official website of
06:52 - the nmap.org that where it tells like uh
06:55 - it's a free and opposite utility for
06:58 - network discovery and security auditing
07:00 - okay
07:01 - so
07:04 - this is the basically one of the tools
07:06 - and there is also one uh
07:10 - scan me dot nmap.org this is the what we
07:14 - can say testing website through which we
07:16 - can test for any for this domain name
07:20 - okay like it's legal to test this domain
07:22 - name because they have already
07:24 - authorized peoples to test this
07:26 - particular domain but you cannot uh test
07:29 - any other domain names without their
07:31 - permission okay so if you do I will not
07:33 - be responsible for that I am clearing
07:35 - this thing in this particular video okay
07:38 - so now let me just
07:41 - okay I think my Internet is slow wait a
07:44 - minute
07:47 - okay so now I've switched with another
07:49 - Network okay
07:52 - so now let's go on this particular
07:54 - website and map.org
07:57 - so here you can see the whole
07:58 - documentation part if you want to read
08:00 - you can read okay
08:03 - so let's go with the reference guide you
08:06 - can go with this or docs also
08:10 - so this is the reference guide
08:13 - in this way we will basically write the
08:15 - command Okay hyphen a option is there
08:17 - okay
08:19 - many options are there there and before
08:21 - that you should know about the TCP Port
08:24 - udb Port okay so basically we have 65
08:28 - 536 ports you know system okay so it
08:32 - basically basically scans which uh
08:37 - which Port are open in your system okay
08:42 - so now let's move with the scanning part
08:45 - okay so let me just check whether this
08:48 - website accessible or not I think it
08:50 - should be yeah so here you can see go
08:52 - ahead and scan miss the title of this
08:54 - particular website okay
08:55 - so now what we can do uh we will just
08:58 - create this script and we will use this
08:59 - nmap tool and some other options okay
09:03 - to run over script okay so now let's do
09:07 - so Eco enter the hostname read hostname
09:10 - okay
09:11 - we will just read the hostname and now
09:14 - next what we will do we will just take
09:17 - the our password okay the system
09:19 - password because the sum of the options
09:22 - required uh sudo permissions so for that
09:26 - we need this enter system password
09:30 - okay so here you will learn one more
09:32 - thing hypheness or hyphen f s option
09:35 - provides like if you will enter
09:37 - something it will not be visible okay so
09:39 - that is the uh
09:41 - benefit of using this option
09:43 - so here we can store with system
09:46 - password okay
09:49 - and then what I will do I will just
09:52 - create one function okay or not function
09:56 - before that uh yeah I will need to
09:59 - create one function to work with the uh
10:02 - cases okay I will just create different
10:04 - cases for different options okay so how
10:07 - we can do it
10:09 - so we have to just write the function
10:11 - name so I will write the function name
10:13 - as the nmap function okay like that I
10:16 - can write okay
10:18 - and in this I have to just provide this
10:21 - um
10:22 - options okay so how I can provide like I
10:25 - will need to write Eco dollar
10:27 - okay and then I will just need to write
10:31 - like this first option will be or I can
10:33 - rule write like this one dot and normal
10:37 - scan okay
10:39 - and we will use slash n for new line
10:42 - Fair
10:44 - two Dot and then tcps scan will be doing
10:48 - three types of scan in this particular
10:49 - video
10:50 - normal scan TCP and the udps scan okay
10:55 - three is
10:57 - UDP scan so these are the three option
10:59 - which will be available to the user and
11:01 - then what I will do we will uh
11:06 - what we can say
11:08 - we will take the input from the user
11:10 - okay choose option
11:13 - choose option which you want to prefer
11:16 - okay
11:20 - so here we will just write the option
11:24 - okay and now what I will need to do I
11:26 - need to prove uh write different cases
11:29 - so if user enter one what should happen
11:31 - if user interest to what should happen
11:33 - all these cases I should write so we
11:35 - have already covered it in our previous
11:37 - videos so how you can deal with the
11:39 - cases okay
11:41 - case option in if one is provided then
11:45 - what you have to do I will just Echo a
11:47 - thing like
11:49 - if one is provided
11:52 - I should write like this eco
11:55 - uh like this
11:57 - normal scan
12:00 - okay like this we are done and then what
12:04 - you will need to do Echo
12:06 - I will just provide the system password
12:09 - to the sudo command Okay so
12:14 - night
12:15 - okay so now what we will do we will just
12:18 - pass the sudo and we will use the
12:20 - capital S like hyphen f s option because
12:23 - we are getting the password from this
12:25 - particular uh system password okay
12:27 - that's why we are using this option and
12:29 - now we will simply use the nmap and the
12:32 - if you are going with the normal skin so
12:34 - at that time we have to just provide the
12:36 - host name or the domain name okay so we
12:38 - can just do like this hostname okay so
12:40 - this is the first case which we'll be
12:42 - doing dealing with that and secondly
12:44 - what we will need to do uh this is just
12:46 - like break a statement and for the
12:49 - second second case that will be for the
12:51 - tcps scan okay
12:54 - so you can do like the interlike this
12:57 - TCP scan and uh
13:01 - these much stash okay
13:04 - and same thing we have to do just we
13:06 - have to change the uh option okay so you
13:10 - can just copy and paste things easily
13:13 - and hyphen as capital T that option will
13:16 - be used for the TCP scan and the third
13:18 - thing is just the udps scan okay
13:20 - so I know yeah you will not be aware of
13:23 - these TCP and udps can because that is
13:25 - the concept of the security part but if
13:27 - you learn you will surely get it
13:30 - UDP scan okay
13:34 - and then again same thing I will just
13:36 - paste the thing here and I will just use
13:38 - the Su that is the one option which we
13:41 - use for the uh
13:43 - what we can say udps scan okay so these
13:46 - are the three options but if you just
13:48 - something else then at that time what we
13:49 - will use we will use the asterisk and
13:51 - then we will provide like
13:54 - please enter the valid option
13:58 - okay
14:00 - so this is the case and we have to just
14:03 - close this thing so how we can do it
14:06 - esac
14:08 - okay and now simply we have to call that
14:10 - that function where it is that nmap
14:12 - function so I will just copy the thing
14:14 - here
14:16 - okay call it here okay now we are good
14:20 - to go first we will need to provide the
14:21 - certain permission to that file okay
14:25 - and now
14:29 - so enter the host name so our host name
14:31 - is
14:34 - this one is can me dot nmap.org okay
14:38 - so it's all upon you you can provide the
14:40 - IP address as well as the domain name
14:41 - where we will go with the domain name
14:43 - first and after that we will go with the
14:45 - IP address
14:47 - sorry we will need to provide like this
14:50 - scan me dot nmap.org okay you will need
14:55 - to enter the system password
14:58 - okay so here we are getting some kind of
15:00 - a right line number 42
15:06 - okay wait a minute
15:09 - oh sorry I have done some mistake
15:14 - I have to just
15:16 - enter the name of the function
15:20 - okay again same thing
15:23 - scan me Dot nmap.org
15:29 - okay so whatever scan we I just want the
15:32 - normal scan
15:35 - so let's check
15:38 - it takes some time so you will need to
15:40 - wait
15:44 - and let's again check the IP of that
15:46 - particular domain name
15:50 - scan me Dot nmap.org
15:54 - okay so I think I'm not connected to the
15:57 - internet
16:00 - okay okay sorry for that
16:06 - okay so now I have solved the issue so
16:09 - let's again run the script
16:13 - enter the hostname scan me Dot nmap.org
16:18 - okay system password
16:22 - normal scan I want okay
16:26 - so it's starting okay so here we you can
16:29 - see we have got the different ports like
16:30 - 22 8929 these much support ports we have
16:34 - got okay so these are the four which are
16:36 - open on that particular domain name okay
16:38 - so also we can run for the second option
16:40 - so
16:42 - again run the same
16:49 - okay second TCP scan okay
16:54 - let's wait
17:01 - this can stick I think much time
17:05 - we will need to just wait
17:09 - so basically in this script we have used
17:10 - uh switch cases and the function concept
17:13 - and the user input all those things we
17:16 - have used here so that was a quiet type
17:18 - of division for you guys okay if you
17:21 - will create these kind of scripts
17:24 - so let's wait for this uh it's taking a
17:27 - little bit more time let's wait
17:34 - okay so we have got the all the TCP
17:36 - ports which are open on that particular
17:38 - domain name so here you can see 2280
17:41 - Triple H so these are the all ports we
17:44 - have got so these are the open port
17:46 - these are some filtered open filtered so
17:48 - you will uh if you research about on
17:50 - Google like what the difference between
17:52 - open a filter poor you will surely get
17:53 - to know and these are the services which
17:55 - you can see here okay so that was a
17:57 - basically uh thing about the scripting
18:00 - like how we can use the different tools
18:02 - with the with bass script okay so that
18:05 - was the tutorial for this and I hope you
18:08 - liked it if you have any query you can
18:09 - go on uh write down in the comment
18:11 - section and we you will get the source
18:13 - code of this particular video in our
18:15 - GitHub repository
18:17 - so that's all for this video and I will
18:18 - meet you in the next one thank you thank
18:19 - you so much for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to the channel this is ayush and now in this particular video we will learn about uh one more script that we will create another script with the help of the nmap tool which we basically use for the network web mapping and we will look for the what are the open ports in the particular uh system using the IP address or the domain name okay so but before moving forward in this particular video I will uh talk about first about this clone repository sh file so we can do one more thing in this particular script is like that uh wait a minute we can just add one more thing here like we can check for the weather user enters the uh correct URL or not okay so we can use the concept of the like substr that is the substring we will match the sub string of a string okay I hope you got the uh concept this thing like what we will do we will just to match the substring part of the this repo link okay if you if it matches with the github.com then we can easily clone the Repository so now what we have to do I will create the just another variable with the name domain name okay so let me just create it domain name equal to github.com github.com okay and I will just need to add the semifills conditions here to check whether the user enters the correct link or not okay so here I will just do dollar repo link equal equal to and I will need to use asterisk because we use that for the substring comparison okay so I can do asterisk and then inside the double quotes I have to just provide the variable name that is the domain name okay so now what we will do we will basically uh like right for the script like then Eco if the link are equal then what we will do what is happening okay let me just copy the same thing again here Eco then we will do this else what we can do else we will just Echo please enter valid link and we will close the condition part here with the fee okay so I hope everything is correct so now what we will do I will just run the script again here so okay I will run the script but before that I will just copy this link okay so just paste it here and the terminal so I'll just run the script using 24 okay clone.sh Enter the depository link I will enter the link okay so here you can see we got some kind of error uh on which line we have got line number 14. okay if repo link equal equal to asterisk okay we forgot to add space here Ctrl s clear the screen okay now I will just add first google.com so it should Pro in yeah so please enter valid link now I will what I will do I will just paste the depositor link enter so here you can see it is cloning into cell scripting tutorial and here you can see the directory has been created with the name cell scripting tutorial so uh our script is running uh fine because if you are entering some wrong URL then at that time we are getting the uh this statement is running like please enter valid link so it means this thing is getting verified okay so that was the part which was remaining in our previous video so now what I will do I will create one more uh script with the name hmm sorry let me just create it 25 underscore on nmap yeah we can do nmap.sh so now if you don't know about the nmap so let me tell you first about what is this so nvap basically one tool that we use for the network mapping or you can say like for finding the open ports in a particular uh system okay so that is a basically a cyber security tool which we use for for Network scanning and all those things we can also get the information about the osc okay so just like other commands uh like for LS we have L option a option so similarly for nmap also we have different options okay which we will learn in this particular video okay so let's start with the scripting part and let me just give you the use case how the thing will go on so the thing is basically whatever you have to read the host name it basically means whether you want to take the domain name or the IP address it all depends upon you what you want to take as an input from the user so you have to take the host name and then further what you have to do you have to just use the nmap commands Okay to just uh what we can say um to just scan that particular host name okay so this is the simple use case which we will be going to use in this particular video so for that first I will need to enter the uh take the input from the user that is the host name okay so let me first clear the screen and now I will just Eco okay wait a minute what's what is happening which key is I think some keys are okay wait a minute some keys are placed automatically wait a minute yeah I think now it's not happened nothing is happening sorry for that so now what I will do eco enter the host name okay but before that let me show you the how the thing is work okay the actual thing works okay so let me just search for the nmap okay so you will get the official website of the nmap.org that where it tells like uh it's a free and opposite utility for network discovery and security auditing okay so this is the basically one of the tools and there is also one uh scan me dot nmap.org this is the what we can say testing website through which we can test for any for this domain name okay like it's legal to test this domain name because they have already authorized peoples to test this particular domain but you cannot uh test any other domain names without their permission okay so if you do I will not be responsible for that I am clearing this thing in this particular video okay so now let me just okay I think my Internet is slow wait a minute okay so now I've switched with another Network okay so now let's go on this particular website and map.org so here you can see the whole documentation part if you want to read you can read okay so let's go with the reference guide you can go with this or docs also so this is the reference guide in this way we will basically write the command Okay hyphen a option is there okay many options are there there and before that you should know about the TCP Port udb Port okay so basically we have 65 536 ports you know system okay so it basically basically scans which uh which Port are open in your system okay so now let's move with the scanning part okay so let me just check whether this website accessible or not I think it should be yeah so here you can see go ahead and scan miss the title of this particular website okay so now what we can do uh we will just create this script and we will use this nmap tool and some other options okay to run over script okay so now let's do so Eco enter the hostname read hostname okay we will just read the hostname and now next what we will do we will just take the our password okay the system password because the sum of the options required uh sudo permissions so for that we need this enter system password okay so here you will learn one more thing hypheness or hyphen f s option provides like if you will enter something it will not be visible okay so that is the uh benefit of using this option so here we can store with system password okay and then what I will do I will just create one function okay or not function before that uh yeah I will need to create one function to work with the uh cases okay I will just create different cases for different options okay so how we can do it so we have to just write the function name so I will write the function name as the nmap function okay like that I can write okay and in this I have to just provide this um options okay so how I can provide like I will need to write Eco dollar okay and then I will just need to write like this first option will be or I can rule write like this one dot and normal scan okay and we will use slash n for new line Fair two Dot and then tcps scan will be doing three types of scan in this particular video normal scan TCP and the udps scan okay three is UDP scan so these are the three option which will be available to the user and then what I will do we will uh what we can say we will take the input from the user okay choose option choose option which you want to prefer okay so here we will just write the option okay and now what I will need to do I need to prove uh write different cases so if user enter one what should happen if user interest to what should happen all these cases I should write so we have already covered it in our previous videos so how you can deal with the cases okay case option in if one is provided then what you have to do I will just Echo a thing like if one is provided I should write like this eco uh like this normal scan okay like this we are done and then what you will need to do Echo I will just provide the system password to the sudo command Okay so night okay so now what we will do we will just pass the sudo and we will use the capital S like hyphen f s option because we are getting the password from this particular uh system password okay that's why we are using this option and now we will simply use the nmap and the if you are going with the normal skin so at that time we have to just provide the host name or the domain name okay so we can just do like this hostname okay so this is the first case which we'll be doing dealing with that and secondly what we will need to do uh this is just like break a statement and for the second second case that will be for the tcps scan okay so you can do like the interlike this TCP scan and uh these much stash okay and same thing we have to do just we have to change the uh option okay so you can just copy and paste things easily and hyphen as capital T that option will be used for the TCP scan and the third thing is just the udps scan okay so I know yeah you will not be aware of these TCP and udps can because that is the concept of the security part but if you learn you will surely get it UDP scan okay and then again same thing I will just paste the thing here and I will just use the Su that is the one option which we use for the uh what we can say udps scan okay so these are the three options but if you just something else then at that time what we will use we will use the asterisk and then we will provide like please enter the valid option okay so this is the case and we have to just close this thing so how we can do it esac okay and now simply we have to call that that function where it is that nmap function so I will just copy the thing here okay call it here okay now we are good to go first we will need to provide the certain permission to that file okay and now so enter the host name so our host name is this one is can me dot nmap.org okay so it's all upon you you can provide the IP address as well as the domain name where we will go with the domain name first and after that we will go with the IP address sorry we will need to provide like this scan me dot nmap.org okay you will need to enter the system password okay so here we are getting some kind of a right line number 42 okay wait a minute oh sorry I have done some mistake I have to just enter the name of the function okay again same thing scan me Dot nmap.org okay so whatever scan we I just want the normal scan so let's check it takes some time so you will need to wait and let's again check the IP of that particular domain name scan me Dot nmap.org okay so I think I'm not connected to the internet okay okay sorry for that okay so now I have solved the issue so let's again run the script enter the hostname scan me Dot nmap.org okay system password normal scan I want okay so it's starting okay so here we you can see we have got the different ports like 22 8929 these much support ports we have got okay so these are the four which are open on that particular domain name okay so also we can run for the second option so again run the same okay second TCP scan okay let's wait this can stick I think much time we will need to just wait so basically in this script we have used uh switch cases and the function concept and the user input all those things we have used here so that was a quiet type of division for you guys okay if you will create these kind of scripts so let's wait for this uh it's taking a little bit more time let's wait okay so we have got the all the TCP ports which are open on that particular domain name so here you can see 2280 Triple H so these are the all ports we have got so these are the open port these are some filtered open filtered so you will uh if you research about on Google like what the difference between open a filter poor you will surely get to know and these are the services which you can see here okay so that was a basically uh thing about the scripting like how we can use the different tools with the with bass script okay so that was the tutorial for this and I hope you liked it if you have any query you can go on uh write down in the comment section and we you will get the source code of this particular video in our GitHub repository so that's all for this video and I will meet you in the next one thank you thank you so much for watching
