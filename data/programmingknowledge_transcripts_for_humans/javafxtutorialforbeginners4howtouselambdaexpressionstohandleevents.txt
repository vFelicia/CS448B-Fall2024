00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java FX tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can use Lambda
00:08 - expression to perform our button action
00:11 - event handling instead of using this
00:15 - Anonymous class which has only one
00:18 - abstract method so in Java 8 there was a
00:22 - term introduced which is called Lambda
00:25 - expression which is made for this
00:29 - situation
00:31 - which says that if you have a single
00:34 - abstract method inside a class you can
00:38 - use Lambda expression to directly call
00:40 - it right so let's see how we can use it
00:45 - so for example I want to add one more
00:47 - button here and I want to press this
00:51 - button and exit from our application
00:54 - right so what I'm going to do is I'm
00:56 - just going to copy this button object
00:59 - and instead of uh button I will name it
01:02 - as exit Okay and the text which I want
01:06 - to uh show here is exit itself okay and
01:12 - in the last video I have shown you there
01:13 - are different kind of layout you can use
01:17 - in Java fix and in the last video we
01:19 - have seen how to use this stack pane now
01:23 - let's say in this video we are going to
01:25 - use V box which is vertical box so just
01:28 - use V box something like this and we
01:33 - will create a new V box and then using
01:39 - this exit object or exit button object
01:43 - we can uh just use it to call set on
01:47 - action method so just call set on action
01:51 - and inside this set on action what we
01:54 - can do is using Lambda expression we can
01:57 - just use e and and this Arrow member and
02:02 - then you can directly call your single
02:06 - line codes for example you want to print
02:08 - something you can just paste it here
02:11 - okay and what this does is it will call
02:14 - this uh method handle because it's a
02:17 - single abstract method inside this
02:20 - Anonymous class and then it will perform
02:24 - whatever you write here right so it's
02:28 - like performing this code inside this
02:32 - handle method okay now for example
02:36 - instead of this I want to uh exit from
02:40 - our application so what I can do is I
02:42 - can just use system do
02:46 - exit and I will set the status as zero
02:50 - here and remove this semicolon and this
02:54 - is how you can use this Lambda
02:57 - expression okay and you can see see in a
03:00 - single line of code we have performed
03:03 - exactly the same task which this class
03:07 - was doing okay which is calling this
03:11 - abstract method right now One Thing
03:15 - Remains is we just want to add this exit
03:19 - to our scene right so just go here where
03:24 - we have called root doget children. add
03:27 - and instead of add we can use a method
03:30 - called add all okay and this method
03:34 - allows us to call
03:36 - multiple wigets for example we have two
03:40 - buttons we can use two arguments one is
03:43 - uh button and other is exit object right
03:47 - so in the form of arguments you can pass
03:51 - multiple object of vits right so just
03:56 - call add all and it will add button one
03:59 - one and exit button to your stage now I
04:04 - want to show you one more thing using
04:06 - this primary stage object you can set
04:10 - the title of uh the stage also so just
04:14 - call set title and give your title which
04:19 - will be shown on the stage so for
04:22 - example my title okay and save your code
04:27 - and run it
04:30 - and now you can see your title is here
04:32 - my title and we can see two buttons one
04:35 - is Click me and other is exit right and
04:38 - when we click this exit button it's
04:41 - going to exit our application right so
04:44 - it's basically doing the same task but
04:48 - in a single line now you may ask if I
04:52 - have multiple lines of code for example
04:55 - I want to print something and then exit
04:58 - what will I do right so for performing
05:01 - the multiple lines in the Lambda
05:04 - expression what we can do here is you
05:08 - can give these two curly braces and
05:12 - inside these two curly braces you can
05:14 - call your code okay so just something
05:19 - like this and before exiting for example
05:21 - you want to print something you can
05:23 - print it so we can say exit this app
05:29 - okay okay and save your code and run
05:33 - it and when I click this exit button
05:36 - it's going to print this and then exit
05:39 - your code okay so if you have multiple
05:42 - line use curly braces with Lambda
05:46 - Expressions so I hope you have enjoyed

hello guys welcome to the next video on Java FX tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use Lambda expression to perform our button action event handling instead of using this Anonymous class which has only one abstract method so in Java 8 there was a term introduced which is called Lambda expression which is made for this situation which says that if you have a single abstract method inside a class you can use Lambda expression to directly call it right so let's see how we can use it so for example I want to add one more button here and I want to press this button and exit from our application right so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this button object and instead of uh button I will name it as exit Okay and the text which I want to uh show here is exit itself okay and in the last video I have shown you there are different kind of layout you can use in Java fix and in the last video we have seen how to use this stack pane now let's say in this video we are going to use V box which is vertical box so just use V box something like this and we will create a new V box and then using this exit object or exit button object we can uh just use it to call set on action method so just call set on action and inside this set on action what we can do is using Lambda expression we can just use e and and this Arrow member and then you can directly call your single line codes for example you want to print something you can just paste it here okay and what this does is it will call this uh method handle because it's a single abstract method inside this Anonymous class and then it will perform whatever you write here right so it's like performing this code inside this handle method okay now for example instead of this I want to uh exit from our application so what I can do is I can just use system do exit and I will set the status as zero here and remove this semicolon and this is how you can use this Lambda expression okay and you can see see in a single line of code we have performed exactly the same task which this class was doing okay which is calling this abstract method right now One Thing Remains is we just want to add this exit to our scene right so just go here where we have called root doget children. add and instead of add we can use a method called add all okay and this method allows us to call multiple wigets for example we have two buttons we can use two arguments one is uh button and other is exit object right so in the form of arguments you can pass multiple object of vits right so just call add all and it will add button one one and exit button to your stage now I want to show you one more thing using this primary stage object you can set the title of uh the stage also so just call set title and give your title which will be shown on the stage so for example my title okay and save your code and run it and now you can see your title is here my title and we can see two buttons one is Click me and other is exit right and when we click this exit button it's going to exit our application right so it's basically doing the same task but in a single line now you may ask if I have multiple lines of code for example I want to print something and then exit what will I do right so for performing the multiple lines in the Lambda expression what we can do here is you can give these two curly braces and inside these two curly braces you can call your code okay so just something like this and before exiting for example you want to print something you can print it so we can say exit this app okay okay and save your code and run it and when I click this exit button it's going to print this and then exit your code okay so if you have multiple line use curly braces with Lambda Expressions so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye
