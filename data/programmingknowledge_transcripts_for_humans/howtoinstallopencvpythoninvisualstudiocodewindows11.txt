00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install and use python
00:04 - opencv on your Visual Studio code editor
00:07 - on your Windows operating system
00:09 - so let's get started so first of all we
00:12 - need to create your project folder so
00:15 - let's create that so I'm going to create
00:18 - a new uh project folder with the name
00:22 - opencv app for example
00:26 - and then I'm going to open this folder
00:28 - in my visual studio code editor which is
00:31 - simple you can just click on open folder
00:33 - or click on file and then click on open
00:36 - folder and then just navigate to your
00:41 - opencv app folder so I'm going to just
00:44 - select this folder and then I'm going to
00:47 - just open this folder in my visual
00:50 - studio code editor I'm going to just say
00:53 - yes I trust this app and then
00:58 - to test my opencv code I'm going to
01:01 - create a very simple
01:04 - python script so let me create a python
01:07 - file first of all I'm going to name my
01:10 - file as test Dot py and then press enter
01:13 - which is going to create the script and
01:16 - then I'm going to just
01:18 - write a very simple opencv script which
01:22 - Imports CV2 library and then you can see
01:27 - it creates some shapes on the image
01:31 - so right now you can see when I import
01:35 - CV2 it says import CV2 could not be
01:38 - resolved so to solve this problem just
01:41 - open your terminal so click on Terminal
01:43 - and then open a new terminal
01:46 - and then first of all we are going to
01:48 - create a new virtual environment in our
01:52 - project so that we can just install
01:54 - opencv libraries locally in our project
01:58 - so just type this command which is
02:01 - python
02:02 - but first of all you can see that I have
02:06 - opened Powershell here
02:09 - I want to open the command prompt
02:11 - terminal and not the Powershell you can
02:13 - use Powershell if you want but for now
02:16 - I'm going to be using command prompt so
02:18 - just make sure that command prompt
02:21 - terminal is open you can just click on
02:25 - this icon and then click on command
02:27 - prompt and the command prompt terminal
02:30 - will be opened now just type python
02:33 - hyphen m
02:35 - v n and the name of your virtual
02:38 - environment I'm going to name my virtual
02:41 - environment as my n you can name your
02:45 - virtual environment as anything so this
02:49 - name can be given by you
02:52 - once you uh have written your command
02:55 - press enter which is going to create
02:57 - your virtual environment in your project
02:59 - you can see this directory is created
03:02 - once you have given the command
03:05 - also Visual Studio code is going to give
03:09 - you this kind of message window which
03:12 - says we noticed a new environment has
03:15 - been created do you want to select it
03:17 - for the workspace folder I can say yes
03:21 - for visual studio code and it will be uh
03:26 - saved for your Visual Studio code so now
03:31 - your environment is created but you need
03:34 - to activate it so when you open your my
03:37 - and or whatever is the name of your
03:39 - virtual environment folder
03:42 - you will see a script directly under it
03:45 - and there is this activate file here we
03:48 - need to run this to activate our virtual
03:51 - environment
03:52 - to run this just type the name of your
03:55 - virtual environment folder which is my
03:58 - end in my case then forward slash then
04:02 - write scripts and then forward slash
04:05 - activate
04:07 - just type this command and then press
04:09 - enter which is going to activate your
04:12 - virtual environment and to verify if
04:15 - your virtual environment has been
04:17 - activated you can see
04:19 - that the name of your virtual
04:20 - environment is now visible in front of
04:24 - your path right so if you see this path
04:28 - that means your virtual environment has
04:31 - been activated for your project before
04:34 - running this command I was not seeing
04:37 - this virtual environment name in front
04:39 - of the path right
04:42 - once that's done in order to install
04:45 - opencv in your project you can give this
04:49 - command so just write pip
04:52 - install and then write open CV hyphen
04:58 - python okay you don't need to install
05:01 - CV2 package because
05:05 - in order to import this Library you just
05:09 - need to install opencv hyphen python
05:12 - package right not CV2 package
05:15 - just type pip install opencv hyphen
05:18 - Python and then press enter which is
05:20 - going to install this pip package in
05:24 - your project and once this command is
05:26 - successful you will see this message
05:28 - which says successfully installed numpy
05:32 - which is the dependency of opencb and
05:36 - opencv python right
05:39 - you can also see this warning and this
05:42 - appears when your pick
05:45 - is older right so in order to upgrade
05:49 - your pip version
05:51 - you can give this command if you want
05:54 - but for now I don't want to do this
05:57 - so once opencv python is installed
06:00 - successfully you can just run your
06:03 - script
06:04 - so now you will see that these squiggly
06:07 - lines are gone
06:09 - from the import
06:13 - I just need to import numpy also in my
06:17 - uh script because I'm using numpy for
06:21 - creating
06:23 - my images
06:25 - now I can just run this script by just
06:28 - typing Python and the name of the script
06:30 - which is test.py in my case and then
06:33 - press enter
06:35 - once I press enter
06:37 - you can see there is the output of my
06:41 - script and I was just creating some
06:44 - shapes in my uh opencv code so it's just
06:48 - creating those shapes here
06:50 - and this is how you can install and use
06:53 - opencv in your Visual Studio code editor
06:58 - right
06:59 - so that's it for this video I hope
07:01 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
07:03 - you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and use python opencv on your Visual Studio code editor on your Windows operating system so let's get started so first of all we need to create your project folder so let's create that so I'm going to create a new uh project folder with the name opencv app for example and then I'm going to open this folder in my visual studio code editor which is simple you can just click on open folder or click on file and then click on open folder and then just navigate to your opencv app folder so I'm going to just select this folder and then I'm going to just open this folder in my visual studio code editor I'm going to just say yes I trust this app and then to test my opencv code I'm going to create a very simple python script so let me create a python file first of all I'm going to name my file as test Dot py and then press enter which is going to create the script and then I'm going to just write a very simple opencv script which Imports CV2 library and then you can see it creates some shapes on the image so right now you can see when I import CV2 it says import CV2 could not be resolved so to solve this problem just open your terminal so click on Terminal and then open a new terminal and then first of all we are going to create a new virtual environment in our project so that we can just install opencv libraries locally in our project so just type this command which is python but first of all you can see that I have opened Powershell here I want to open the command prompt terminal and not the Powershell you can use Powershell if you want but for now I'm going to be using command prompt so just make sure that command prompt terminal is open you can just click on this icon and then click on command prompt and the command prompt terminal will be opened now just type python hyphen m v n and the name of your virtual environment I'm going to name my virtual environment as my n you can name your virtual environment as anything so this name can be given by you once you uh have written your command press enter which is going to create your virtual environment in your project you can see this directory is created once you have given the command also Visual Studio code is going to give you this kind of message window which says we noticed a new environment has been created do you want to select it for the workspace folder I can say yes for visual studio code and it will be uh saved for your Visual Studio code so now your environment is created but you need to activate it so when you open your my and or whatever is the name of your virtual environment folder you will see a script directly under it and there is this activate file here we need to run this to activate our virtual environment to run this just type the name of your virtual environment folder which is my end in my case then forward slash then write scripts and then forward slash activate just type this command and then press enter which is going to activate your virtual environment and to verify if your virtual environment has been activated you can see that the name of your virtual environment is now visible in front of your path right so if you see this path that means your virtual environment has been activated for your project before running this command I was not seeing this virtual environment name in front of the path right once that's done in order to install opencv in your project you can give this command so just write pip install and then write open CV hyphen python okay you don't need to install CV2 package because in order to import this Library you just need to install opencv hyphen python package right not CV2 package just type pip install opencv hyphen Python and then press enter which is going to install this pip package in your project and once this command is successful you will see this message which says successfully installed numpy which is the dependency of opencb and opencv python right you can also see this warning and this appears when your pick is older right so in order to upgrade your pip version you can give this command if you want but for now I don't want to do this so once opencv python is installed successfully you can just run your script so now you will see that these squiggly lines are gone from the import I just need to import numpy also in my uh script because I'm using numpy for creating my images now I can just run this script by just typing Python and the name of the script which is test.py in my case and then press enter once I press enter you can see there is the output of my script and I was just creating some shapes in my uh opencv code so it's just creating those shapes here and this is how you can install and use opencv in your Visual Studio code editor right so that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
