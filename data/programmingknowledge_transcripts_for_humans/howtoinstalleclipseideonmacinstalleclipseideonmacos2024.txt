00:07 - so first of all before installing
00:09 - Eclipse you need to make sure that you
00:12 - have Java jdk installed on your Mac
00:15 - operating system because eclipse is a
00:17 - Java based
00:19 - IDE now if you don't know how to uh
00:21 - install uh Java I have already created a
00:25 - video on that so just watch that video
00:28 - and once you have Java jdk you good to
00:31 - go so once you have Java jdk installed
00:36 - let's start with the installation of
00:38 - Eclipse IDE so for that you need to uh
00:42 - open your favorite browser and search
00:44 - for download eclipse and the first link
00:48 - which will appear here will be from
00:50 - eclipse.org g/d downloads we going to

00:59 - Eclipse IDE so here you will see
01:04 - different variants of eclipse but uh the
01:07 - variant we want is this one so here what
01:10 - we are going to do is we are going to uh
01:13 - click on the download packages under
01:17 - this Eclipse logo so I'm going to click
01:20 - on download packages here where you will
01:23 - see more information about the
01:26 - installation of Eclipse IDE now now here
01:30 - you will see at the top the first option
01:33 - which is for Eclipse
01:35 - installer this Eclipse installer is
01:38 - going to allow you to install different
01:42 - variants of Eclipse IDE so if uh you are
01:45 - interested in installing different
01:48 - variants of Eclipse IDE for example
01:51 - eclipse is available for Java developers
01:54 - Eclipse IDE is also available for
01:57 - Enterprise Java and web Developers
02:00 - Eclipse IDE for C and C++ developers so
02:03 - if you uh plan to install more than one
02:07 - variant of Eclipse IDE I will recommend
02:11 - you to install the eclipse installer
02:14 - which will make it easier to install
02:18 - other variants of eclipse in future also
02:22 - so here in front of eclipse installer
02:26 - you will see the Mac OS section and you
02:29 - will see two downlo links in front of uh
02:31 - Mac OS now if you're using Intel based
02:35 - processor then you can use the first
02:37 - link which is X
02:40 - 8664 if you have the newer version of
02:43 - Mac OS and you are using M1 or M2 Chip
02:48 - then you can use ar ar 64 so in my case
02:52 - I'm using the M2 based processor so let
02:56 - me click on M1 M2 variant which is AR 64
02:59 - 4 and then you will uh be redirected to
03:03 - uh this page here you just need to click
03:06 - on download once again and once you
03:08 - click on download you will see that this
03:11 - Eclipse uh installer JRE Mac a AR 64 is
03:16 - downloaded so let me click on this file
03:19 - which is going to open this kind of
03:21 - installer so let me minimize my browser
03:24 - and let's start with the installation
03:27 - part so here you can see this is the
03:30 - eclipse installer so just click on the
03:32 - eclipse installer here now as I
03:35 - mentioned eclipse is available for
03:38 - different type of development
03:40 - environments so what we are going to do
03:43 - is first of all we are going to install
03:45 - the Eclipse IDE for Java developers
03:48 - later you can install the other variants
03:51 - of Eclipse IDE but for now I'm going to
03:54 - use this version which is Eclipse IDE
03:58 - for Java developers so let me click
03:59 - click on this option now as you can see
04:01 - the installation has been started for
04:04 - the Eclipse IDE for Java developers here
04:07 - it says Java 17 plus VM so in this
04:11 - drop-down menu once you have installed
04:14 - Java jdk on your Mac operating system
04:18 - you will see that version in this list
04:22 - so as I can see jdk 21 uh is the version
04:27 - which I have installed so so it's
04:29 - selected by default if you don't have
04:32 - any version of java previously then you
04:34 - can choose the other versions of J here
04:38 - which is going to download those
04:40 - versions from the internet and install
04:43 - it on your Macbook so because I have
04:46 - already installed Java I will choose the
04:48 - first version which is already uh there
04:52 - in my Mac operating system also you can
04:54 - see the installation path for Eclipse so
04:57 - if you don't have the good reason to
04:59 - change change this path just leave it as
05:01 - default and then click on
05:03 - install and once you click on install
05:06 - you will see this uh license terms and
05:09 - conditions page so you can just read the
05:12 - license terms and conditions and if you
05:14 - agree just click on accept now which is
05:17 - going to start the installation of
05:19 - Eclipse IDE for Java developers so at
05:22 - this point we are going to uh wait for
05:25 - some time until this progress bar
05:27 - reaches to the 100% Mark and after a few
05:30 - seconds I can see that eclipse is
05:34 - installed and I also see the launch
05:37 - button for Eclipse so eclipse is now
05:40 - installed on my Mac operating system so
05:44 - at this point I'm going to click on
05:45 - launch now before moving into this uh
05:48 - process of starting Eclipse first of all
05:51 - we are going to move this Eclipse
05:54 - installer to our applications so from
05:57 - the next time when we want to install
05:59 - any other Eclipse variant for example
06:02 - eclipse for C++ we will have this
06:04 - Eclipse installer so just select this uh
06:08 - Eclipse installer and you will also see
06:11 - the applications uh folder so just press
06:14 - command key on your keyboard and then
06:17 - move this icon into the applications
06:21 - folder and once this is moved into the
06:24 - applications folder when you go to the
06:26 - Launchpad you will be able to see this
06:28 - eclipse installer there right so from
06:31 - the next time when you want to uh
06:33 - install any other variants just click on
06:36 - the eclipse
06:37 - installer and you will be able to uh see
06:41 - the other variants of Eclipse which you
06:43 - can download easily using this Eclipse
06:46 - installer now before moving forward into
06:49 - this process of launching the Eclipse
06:52 - IDE what I will recommend you to do is
06:55 - we need to know the path of this Eclipse
06:58 - IDE because because when you install
07:00 - Eclipse IDE for Java developers you will
07:02 - not see the Eclipse IDE icon in the
07:06 - applications folder right so what we can
07:10 - do here is we can right click on this
07:13 - Eclipse IDE icon and then click on
07:16 - options and then click on show in finder
07:18 - which is going to show this Eclipse icon
07:21 - in the finder what you need to do is you
07:23 - need to move this Eclipse icon into the
07:26 - applications folder once again select
07:29 - this Eclipse uh icon press command key
07:32 - and then move this uh Eclipse icon into
07:35 - the applications folder you can see I'm
07:38 - hovering over the applications folder
07:40 - and then I just drop it on top of the
07:43 - applications folder which is going to
07:46 - move the eclipse icon in the
07:49 - applications folder and once you are
07:52 - done with that Eclipse app is moved to
07:55 - the applications folder so when you open
07:57 - the launch pad now you will be able to
08:01 - see the Eclipse IDE icon here also okay
08:05 - so once that's done we are ready to
08:08 - launch the Eclipse IDE let me just
08:11 - cancel uh this uh from here and we are
08:13 - going to start the eclipse ID from the
08:16 - Launchpad so I'm going to go to the
08:17 - Launchpad and then click on Eclipse IDE
08:20 - icon and for the first time when Eclipse
08:22 - IDE start it creates the workspace
08:26 - folder where all your uh eclipse related
08:29 - project will be saved so this is the
08:32 - default location if you don't have the
08:34 - good reason to change this location just
08:36 - leave it as default and then click on
08:37 - launch now the Eclipse IDE has been
08:40 - launched here so first of all what we
08:43 - are going to do here is we are going to
08:45 - just close this uh welcome window from
08:49 - here and once we close this welcome
08:52 - window it's going to open this kind of
08:54 - Eclipse IDE interface now in order to
08:58 - create a new Java project you can see we
09:00 - have the option to create a new Java
09:03 - project from here or you can also go to
09:06 - the files option and then click on new
09:08 - and then you have the option to create
09:11 - different kind of uh Java related
09:13 - project like Maven project or other
09:16 - projects so first of all I'm going to uh
09:19 - click on create a Java project here and
09:22 - then I'm going to name my project as
09:25 - hello for
09:26 - example and then it says use default
09:31 - location so I'm going to use default
09:33 - location which is inside the eclipse
09:35 - workspace also JRE it's selected by
09:40 - default which I have installed which is
09:42 - Java se21 so Eclipse recognizes my uh gr
09:48 - and it gives me the option to choose it
09:50 - now project layout use project folder as
09:52 - the root for sources and class file
09:55 - create separate folder for sources and
09:58 - uh class file file I'm going to leave it
10:00 - as default also the module create module
10:05 - uh info. Java so for now I don't want to
10:08 - uh create this file so I'm going to just
10:11 - uncheck this uh checkbox because I just
10:14 - want to create a very simple Java
10:16 - project and then I'm going to click on
10:18 - finish here which is going to create
10:21 - this project so you can see this hello
10:24 - project is created and inside this hello
10:26 - project I have this Source directory
10:29 - which doesn't contain any file right so
10:32 - in order to create a new Java class I'm
10:35 - going to right click here and then click
10:37 - on new and then click on class here and
10:41 - then I'm going to name my class as hello
10:44 - itself which will be a public
10:47 - class and then I can also check this
10:51 - checkbox which says uh I want to include
10:54 - the public static void main method so
10:57 - it's going to uh create this hello class
10:59 - and inside that hello class our public
11:02 - static void main method will be there
11:05 - and then I'm going to click on finish
11:07 - which is going to create this class now
11:09 - once my uh class is created I can see
11:12 - this main method to print hello world
11:16 - using this main method I'm going to just
11:18 - type uh system dot out dot print Ln and
11:25 - then inside these parenthesis I can just
11:27 - type hello
11:29 - World here and once I'm done I can uh
11:33 - save my project by clicking on this uh
11:35 - save button and all changes will be
11:39 - saved so once my Java program is saved I
11:43 - can click on this uh run button and then
11:45 - click on this uh run option which is
11:48 - going to build my Java program and it's
11:51 - going to run it and I can see this hello
11:54 - world is printed on my uh terminal or
11:58 - cons Soul so everything is working fine
12:01 - I can add a few uh more uh characters
12:06 - here for
12:07 - example like this and then save my
12:11 - program and run it once again and it's
12:13 - going to print those characters also in
12:17 - the console so everything is working
12:18 - fine here so this is how you can install
12:22 - Eclipse IDE and create a Java program
12:26 - using Eclipse IDE on your Mac operating
12:28 - system system I hope you've enjoyed this
