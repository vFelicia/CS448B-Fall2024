00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install and enable
00:05 - openssh on your Ubuntu operating system
00:09 - so using openssh when you have openssh
00:13 - on your Ubuntu operating system or any
00:16 - other Linux operating system
00:18 - you can access this uh Ubuntu operating
00:21 - system remotely using SSH from any other
00:26 - computer right which supports SSH
00:30 - so let's see how we can check first of
00:33 - all if open SSH is installed and then we
00:37 - will see how we can install it and use
00:40 - it so first of all open your terminal by
00:43 - pressing Ctrl alt t or you can go to the
00:47 - applications and then click on Terminal
00:49 - or you can directly search for terminal
00:53 - once terminal is open just give this
00:55 - command which is SSH and then press
00:58 - enter
00:59 - and if it gives this kind of output
01:02 - output which says usage and then SSH and
01:05 - then a bunch of help Flags right this
01:10 - means that SSH client is installed on
01:14 - your Ubuntu operating system
01:16 - using SSH client you can connect to any
01:20 - remote system
01:22 - using this SSH client using its IP and
01:28 - username
01:29 - so for that you can use SSH command and
01:33 - then space user which is the username of
01:37 - your remote computer which you want to
01:39 - connect to and then at the rate IP
01:42 - address of that remote operating system
01:46 - it can be hostname or IP address right
01:49 - and then if that remote
01:52 - operating system
01:55 - have different port other than 22 so by
01:59 - default default port for SSH connection
02:01 - is 22 but if it has some other Port
02:06 - configured then you can just give hyphen
02:10 - p and then the port for example 443 or
02:14 - any other Port right so this is how you
02:16 - can connect to that remote system
02:21 - now in order to check whether open SSS
02:23 - server is installed on your Ubuntu
02:25 - operating system you can give this
02:26 - command which is SSH localhost
02:31 - which is essentially going to check
02:33 - whether SSH is installed locally on your
02:39 - operating system right so if it gives
02:43 - this kind of error which says SSH
02:46 - connect to a host localhost Port 22
02:49 - refused then open SSH server is not
02:53 - installed right so let's see how we can
02:56 - install it so let me uh clear the
03:00 - terminal and here you can first of all
03:03 - give this command sudo apt update for
03:07 - example so just give this command update
03:11 - and then press enter and give your
03:13 - ubuntu's password and wait for this
03:17 - command to finish
03:19 - and once this command is finished we are
03:22 - going to uh clear our terminal for
03:25 - example and then to install the open SSS
03:29 - server give this command sudo apt
03:32 - install
03:34 - open sh hyphen server okay and then
03:39 - press enter
03:41 - and press Y and then press enter once
03:44 - again which is going to start the
03:46 - installation of open SSH server on your
03:49 - Ubuntu operating system
03:51 - so just wait for this command to finish
03:54 - the command is now finished successfully
03:57 - I have this error related to Jenkins
04:00 - which has nothing to do with this
04:02 - installation I have some problem with
04:04 - Jenkins installation which it's
04:06 - complaining right now but open SSH
04:09 - server is now installed now how you can
04:12 - check whether open SSH server is
04:15 - installed
04:16 - so when open SSH server is installed it
04:21 - creates a service and then you can check
04:23 - whether that service is running or not
04:27 - right
04:28 - so you can just write sudo
04:32 - system CTL and then
04:36 - status and then SSH okay and if that is
04:41 - active that's good because open SSH
04:45 - server is running successfully if it's
04:49 - not working or it says inactive or some
04:54 - kind of red here instead of green active
04:58 - then to enable it you can simply give
05:01 - this command which is sudo system CTL
05:05 - enable and then hyphen hyphen now and
05:10 - then SSH which is going to enable open
05:14 - SSH right
05:16 - now once open SSH is
05:20 - active and running you can give once
05:24 - again this command SSH
05:27 - localhost
05:29 - and then press enter and this time you
05:32 - can see it gives us this kind of output
05:35 - that means that this command is trying
05:39 - to connect to the open SSS server which
05:43 - you have installed on your local
05:46 - operating system which is this Ubuntu
05:49 - itself right if you give username and
05:53 - then the IP address and then the port
05:55 - here instead of localhost then this
05:59 - command is going to connect or try to
06:01 - connect to that remote operating system
06:03 - right so right now we are connecting to
06:07 - our Local Host using SSH just to test
06:09 - whether it's working or not and it says
06:12 - are you sure you want to continue
06:14 - connecting I will just
06:17 - press yes here and then press enter
06:21 - and then you can see it's asking me for
06:25 - the password of the system which I want
06:29 - to connect to right in this case it's
06:32 - localhost so I'm going to provide the
06:34 - password of my local uh operating system
06:37 - so let me give that password and once
06:41 - that's finished I am connected remotely
06:44 - to my local host itself right so this
06:48 - was just to check whether SSH is working
06:50 - now from now on you can connect to this
06:54 - Ubuntu operating system from any other
06:58 - operating system which support SSH
07:00 - client right so you can give the
07:04 - username and IP address and hopefully
07:07 - the password of your Ubuntu operating
07:11 - system and then you can allow someone
07:14 - remotely or you you yourself remotely to
07:17 - connect to this Ubuntu operating system
07:20 - now let's say if you want to change the
07:22 - default port number for open SSH server
07:26 - on your Ubuntu operating system
07:28 - the default Port as I mentioned earlier
07:31 - is 2022 and let's say you want to change
07:34 - this default port to some other Port so
07:36 - you can give this command which is sudo
07:39 - you can either give Nano or G edit or
07:42 - any other editor you want to use I'm
07:45 - going to use G edit here and then
07:48 - forward slash
07:50 - Etc power slash SSH forward slash
07:55 - ssht underscore config okay and then
08:00 - press enter and then give your ubuntu's
08:02 - password
08:03 - and it's going to open this file in your
08:07 - editor in my case it's G edit
08:10 - now as I said
08:12 - the default Port is Port 2022 you can
08:16 - change it by just uncommenting this line
08:20 - and then change it to your Port right so
08:24 - for example I want to just connect or
08:28 - change this port to 2 2
08:30 - 4 4 for example right so if this port is
08:35 - free on your Ubuntu operating system
08:37 - from the next time you can use this port
08:39 - to connect to your remote or this
08:44 - operating system so let me save this
08:47 - file
08:48 - and once I say save it I can just close
08:51 - this and once I close this let me
08:55 - clear the terminal
08:57 - and then and once you are done you have
09:01 - to restart your SSH service so you can
09:05 - just write uh sudo first and then system
09:09 - CTL
09:11 - and then your command which is restart
09:16 - so we want to restart the service right
09:19 - and then SSH so because we have changed
09:22 - the configuration of SSH we have to
09:25 - reload this service with the new
09:27 - configuration so I'm going to just
09:29 - restart it by giving this command and
09:31 - giving my ubuntu's password
09:33 - and then I can even check the status
09:37 - after the restart so let me just
09:40 - check the status here
09:42 - and it's running right so now
09:46 - I will try to connect to this
09:50 - openss server
09:53 - using SSH localhost then hyphen p and
09:57 - then gave the New Port which is 2244 in
10:00 - my case and now I am connecting using
10:04 - this port if I have given SSH
10:07 - localhost command without the port which
10:10 - is uh 22 by default but we have changed
10:13 - it right so if we give this command open
10:16 - SSH client is going to connect to the
10:19 - default port and it will refuse the
10:22 - connection right this default Port is 22
10:25 - but we have changes so you have to give
10:28 - this port now to connect to your open
10:31 - SSH server right so that's it for this
10:35 - video I hope you have enjoyed this video
10:37 - and I will see you in the next video

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and enable openssh on your Ubuntu operating system so using openssh when you have openssh on your Ubuntu operating system or any other

once this command is finished we are going to uh clear our terminal for example and then to install the open SSS server give this command sudo apt install open sh hyphen server okay and then press enter and press Y and then press enter once again which is going to start the installation of open SSH server on your Ubuntu operating system so just wait for this command to finish the command is now finished successfully I have this error related to Jenkins which has nothing to do with this installation I have some problem with Jenkins installation which it's complaining right now but open SSH server is now installed now how you can check whether open SSH server is installed so when open SSH server is installed it creates a service and then you can check whether that service is running or

inactive or some kind of red here instead of green active then to enable it you can simply give this command which is sudo system CTL enable and then hyphen hyphen now and then SSH which is going to enable open SSH right now once open SSH is active and running you can give once again this command SSH localhost and then press enter and this time you can see it gives us this kind of output that means that this command is trying to connect to the open SSS server which you have installed on your local operating system which is this Ubuntu itself right if you give username and then the IP address and then the port here instead of localhost then this command is going to connect or try to connect to that remote operating system right so right now we are connecting to our Local Host using SSH just to test whether it's working or not and it says are you sure you want to continue connecting I will just press yes here and then press enter and then you can see it's asking me for the password of the system which I want to connect to right in this case it's localhost so I'm going to provide the password of my local uh operating system so let me give that password and once that's finished I am connected remotely to my local host itself right so this was just to check whether SSH is working now from now on you can connect to this Ubuntu operating system from any other operating system which support SSH client right so you can give the username and IP address and hopefully the password of your Ubuntu operating system and then you can allow someone remotely or you you yourself remotely to connect to this Ubuntu operating system now let's say if you want to change the default port number for open SSH server on your Ubuntu operating system the default Port as I mentioned

I'm going to use G edit here and then forward slash Etc power slash SSH forward slash ssht underscore config okay and then press enter and then give your ubuntu's password and it's going to open this file in your editor in my case it's G edit now as I said the default Port is Port 2022 you can change it by just uncommenting this line and then change it to your Port right so for example I want to just connect or change this port to 2 2 4 4 for example right so if this port is free on your Ubuntu operating system from the next time you can use this port to connect to your remote or this

case and now I am connecting using this port if I have given SSH localhost command without the port which is uh 22 by default but we have changed it right so if we give this command open SSH client is going to connect to the default port and it will refuse the connection right this default Port is 22 but we have changes so you have to give this port now to connect to your open SSH server right so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
