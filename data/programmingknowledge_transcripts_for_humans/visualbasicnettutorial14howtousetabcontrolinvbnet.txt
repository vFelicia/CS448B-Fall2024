00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use tab
00:05 - control with your Visual Basic Windows
00:08 - Form
00:08 - application so let's get started I will
00:11 - just go to my toolbox and I will search
00:15 - for the tab control here it is I will
00:18 - drag and drop into my
00:20 - form and for the first time when you
00:24 - drag and drop this uh tab control into
00:26 - your form it has two tabs tab one and
00:30 - tab two by
00:32 - default so generally uh we want to use
00:36 - tab control when you
00:38 - have
00:39 - uh little space and you want to show
00:42 - more so you
00:45 - can double your space which is available
00:49 - on one form by using tab controls okay
00:55 - so let me show you first of all how uh
00:59 - we can generate generate more tabs in
01:01 - this tab control so just select your tab
01:03 - control and just
01:07 - go to this
01:10 - collection and here you can add new tabs
01:15 - so right now I have two tabs once again
01:19 - I will show you just select this tab
01:21 - control as a whole and go to the
01:25 - property called tab pages and select
01:29 - this button and then add a new tab from
01:33 - here okay like this and likewise if you
01:37 - want to remove the tab just click this
01:40 - remove button now you can also change
01:43 - the text of this these tabs for example
01:47 - I select first Tab and the name of this
01:52 - tab is tab page one and text of this tab
01:56 - I will change it as login tab for
02:06 - example
02:08 - and the second tab I will name it
02:15 - as image images tab and third tab is to
02:21 - close the application this is just the
02:24 - demonstration so you can do whatever you
02:28 - want
02:32 - so when I do this you see here all the
02:36 - tabs have now the heading which I have
02:38 - provided to them right and there are
02:42 - other properties like background color
02:45 - if you want to change background images
02:48 - also if you have any you can give these
02:53 - images just go to the local resources
02:57 - and just set any image which you want
03:00 - for example this image I select and
03:04 - click okay and you see in the close tab
03:08 - I have this image right you have font
03:13 - you have four color so basically you
03:16 - just need to play with the properties in
03:18 - order
03:21 - to run or you in order to use these tabs
03:26 - so now when I run the
03:28 - program
03:31 - I have three tabs one is login one is
03:34 - image and one is close which have the
03:37 - background image which I
03:39 - set
03:41 - and this has uh the a efficiency of
03:47 - space right so you your space is now
03:52 - multiplied by three which was available
03:55 - previously right because we are using
03:58 - three tabs and
04:00 - and you can segregate your task in these
04:04 - tabs this is also one use so for example
04:08 - now you want to add some of the tools in
04:11 - the first tab it's just very easy for
04:16 - example I want to add a button I want to
04:21 - add some uh
04:24 - label here so I will search for uh the
04:28 - label one and two and I will also take a
04:34 - text
04:35 - box or a two text box so I will change
04:40 - the name of uh this or text of the label
04:44 - which is first is name and second
04:50 - is surname for
04:53 - example okay so it works like uh normal
04:58 - tools uh it has no effect or the these
05:03 - tools or text box or label or button
05:05 - have no effect whatsoever while they are
05:09 - in these tabs so they will work this
05:13 - name can be used as it is we have used
05:17 - earlier this has
05:19 - textbox one so this has it its own name
05:22 - it doesn't change or doesn't matter if
05:25 - you are using tabs or not right so
05:30 - like this and for example in second
05:33 - second tab I want to show some image so
05:37 - I will take a picture box from
05:40 - here and then I will choose an
05:45 - image go to the local resources and
05:49 - choose an
05:51 - image which image I want to choose like
05:56 - this okay and I will
06:00 - make it Zoom so it will be stretched or
06:03 - you can make it stretch image so that it
06:06 - will stretch to
06:08 - your picture box and on the third you
06:13 - can add a
06:16 - button and call it call this button as
06:20 - exit button so I say this is uh
06:26 - exit button this is just a small
06:29 - demonstration so you can do whatever you
06:33 - want with the tabs I will just double
06:35 - click this and I will say
06:40 - end and when I run the program
06:45 - now just click this and run the
06:48 - program and it has
06:51 - normal functioning for the login page
06:56 - for the image tab it has my images and
07:00 - for for the close tab it has exit button
07:04 - which when I press it exits so in this
07:07 - way you can use tab control with your
07:10 - Visual Basic Windows Form application I
07:14 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
