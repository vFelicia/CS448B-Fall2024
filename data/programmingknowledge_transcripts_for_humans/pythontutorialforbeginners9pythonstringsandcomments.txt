00:00 - Hey guys welcome to the next video in Python tutorial for beginners. In this video we will talk about using  strings in python
00:08 - But before that I want to show you something
00:13 - And that is how to comment your code in python or how to write a comment in python
00:21 - So for example I have this line of code which is used to print hello world on terminal
00:26 - and for some reason I don´t want to execute it this line of code the I can convert this statement in to a comment
00:33 - and how do I do this?
00:35 - You can just add and asterisk in front your code and this makes your statement into a comment
00:43 - A comment means that now this line of code will not be executed by python
00:51 - So let´s run our code and let´s see what happens
00:54 - so you can see now it doesn´t print hello world
00:57 - because now this is a comment
01:00 - Generally we use comments in order to provide some information about
01:06 - some funtionality or what we want to do with our code
01:09 - So let me remove this line
01:11 - and because is a python strings video we can just write after this hast symbol python strings. right?
01:20 - and this means this is a comment
01:22 - and this line will not be executed by python interpreteur
01:27 - now there is one more way of giving a comment in python
01:31 - which is writting the double quotes three times
01:35 - and this is also a comment
01:38 - so when you write, for example, python strings
01:42 - this is also a comment
01:44 - so this also will be not executed by python interpreteur
01:49 - so what is the difference between this hast comment and the comment with
01:53 - this three double quotes
01:57 - so it turns out that using this double quotes you can write mutiple line comment
02:04 - So for example I want to write a multiple line comment
02:08 - let´s say I want to write python string tutorial
02:13 - I can write this multiple line comment using triple doble quotes
02:18 - So let´s get started and let´s see how we can use strings in python
02:23 - So I am going to declare a variable and
02:25 - this variable I am going to assign hello world.. (here, right?)
02:32 - and to print this hello world  we can just write print
02:35 - and in the parentheses we can just use this ex variable
02:40 - and when we run the code, it runs
02:43 - we already know how to use this kind of strings in python
02:48 - the second way of creating a string  is
02:52 - you can use single quote instead of double quotes this is also a valid string
02:59 - so this will also works so let me
03:01 - just a print this also
03:05 - which is hello world using single quotes and when I
03:10 - ..I am going to run this is going to give me the results
03:14 - Let me remove these spaces between the print and parentheses
03:19 - let´s say you want add a single quote into this hello world string
03:23 - so let´s say I want to just write hello single quote s, hello´s world
03:29 - so this is totally possible in python so
03:32 - whenever you soround your string using your double quote
03:35 - you can just add a single quote without any problem
03:39 - but when you do the same
03:41 - with the string this will give you a problem
03:46 - because now python thinks that your string starts from here
03:50 - and ends at this place just after hello
03:54 - and this will be seems as some kind of garbage by python
03:58 - so in order to use the single quote inside  the string which use a single quote you use a scape character
04:06 - and a escape character in python is back slash, ok?
04:11 - so when you add a back slash in from of a character python interpreter knows that is a escape character
04:19 - so this will be teatred as a valid string
04:23 - so let me just print the result and you can see it prints the same result now
04:29 - let´s say I want to use a double quote in the string which uses a double quote already
04:36 - so I am going to give just a double quote here
04:39 - and the same problem arises which we have seen in the string with single code
04:45 - to escape this you can alse use back slash and the problem will be gone
04:50 - lets run the program and it gives us this hello world with double quote
04:57 - so you can print this double quote using this escape character which is a back slash
05:03 - now let´s say you want to print a string with a back slash itshelf
05:07 - so I can add a back slash here and I want to add a back slash here
05:11 - and let´s save the code and the lets run it and let´s see if it runs or not
05:16 - so it turned out that you can use this kind of notations in python
05:20 - also when you use double back slashes here and here
05:24 - let´s see what happens so when we run the code it will give us the same result
05:29 - because one back slash is a escape character
05:34 - and other back slash is the part of the string so it will print the same result
05:40 - so you can use this for a escaping this character
05:44 - or you can remove this, the result will be same
05:48 - so now let me add it this two strings and I am going to use hello here
05:53 - with the capital h and I am also going to assign
05:58 - hello to the y variable with a small h here
06:02 - now python provides us some inbuild funtions
06:05 - which you can use with strings
06:08 - so this is a string right? so you can use some methods related to strings
06:15 - on the x and y variable so let´s see what are these methods
06:20 - so after the x I can just press dot
06:23 - and you can see so many suggestions is given to us by pycharm
06:29 - and this is called intellegence with is provided by pycharm to us
06:33 - and in intelegence means than whenever you type something
06:37 - pycharm will try to suggest you some supporting code for whatever you are typing
06:44 - so let´s use some methods which are suggested to us
06:47 - so I am going to use this capitalize method
06:49 - let´s use this capitalize method with the x and y variable
06:55 - and let´s see what happen I am going to run the code
06:58 - and you can see now in the upper string is printed same
07:01 - but in the lower string is printed with a capital h in front of it
07:07 - so this capitalize method capitalizes the first letter of the string
07:12 - now let´s see what are some of the other methods which we can use
07:18 - so there is a method called upper
07:21 - and also there is a method called .lower
07:26 - so let me just rewrite this hello in all capitals
07:31 - and let´s run the code now
07:34 - and you can see in the result the upper method has converted our string in to all upper letters
07:41 - and the lower method has converted our string into all lower letters
07:46 - in python everything is an object
07:49 - so using this square brakets
07:51 - you can extract each and every letter based upon that index
