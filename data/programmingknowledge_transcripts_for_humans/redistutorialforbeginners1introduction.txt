00:00 - hey guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - redis tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video I'm going to give you a brief
00:07 - introduction about redis so first of all
00:10 - what is redis so redis is an open-source
00:13 - BSD licensed Advanced inmemory key Value
00:17 - Store where keys can contain data
00:20 - structures such as strings hashes lists
00:24 - sets and sortage sets so it's an
00:28 - inmemory key Value Store with
00:31 - persistence that means radis can be used
00:34 - as a database or a caching layer or a
00:38 - message broker now I already said that
00:42 - it's BSD licensed that means it's open
00:46 - source now redis is written in C and
00:48 - it's nosql database now what is nosql
00:53 - nosql is an informal Loosely defined
00:57 - term for non-relational structured data
01:01 - storage systems like mongodb mcash cou
01:06 - DB or Cassandra so following in the
01:09 - footsteps of uh other nosql databases
01:13 - such as cassendra couch DB or mongod DB
01:16 - radis allows the user to store vast
01:20 - amount of data without the limits of
01:23 - relational databases so in nosql
01:26 - databases data can be stored in non
01:29 - relation
01:30 - way now what does the name radis mean
01:33 - radis stands for remote directory server
01:36 - it is often referred to as a data
01:39 - structure server since the keys can
01:42 - contain strings hashes lists sets and
01:45 - sorted sets so because the keys can
01:49 - contains these type of different data
01:51 - structures it's often referred as a data
01:56 - structure server right so the name come
01:58 - from remote Direct server now what is
02:01 - radis used for so as I already mentioned
02:06 - that it's an advanced key value store
02:09 - that can function as a nosql database or
02:12 - as a memory cache store to improve
02:14 - performance when serving data that is
02:17 - stored in system memory and also it can
02:20 - be used as a message broker so it can be
02:24 - used in place of caching systems such as
02:27 - mam cached now you must be wondering how
02:30 - to interact with radis so radis can be
02:33 - installed on a server and it can be
02:37 - interacted with a command line tool or
02:40 - command line interface which is called
02:42 - radis CLI so using this radis CLI we can
02:46 - interact with our redis server now this
02:50 - redis client can be used on any machine
02:54 - and then when we open this redis client
02:57 - which is a command line client uh the
03:00 - first line will look like this so redish
03:03 - then this kind of angle bracket this we
03:06 - will see in the coming videos how to
03:08 - install redis and how we can use redis
03:12 - now let's talk about some of the history
03:15 - about redis so in early 2009 a developer
03:19 - called salvator Sanfilippo he was an
03:23 - Italian developer by the way started the
03:26 - redis project at that time he was
03:29 - working on a realtime web analytics
03:32 - solution and found that myql could not
03:35 - provide the necessary performance so in
03:38 - June 2009 redis was deployed in
03:41 - production for a website called log.com
03:45 - which was our realtime web analytics
03:48 - website then in March 2010 a company
03:52 - called VMware hired Sanfilippo to work
03:56 - full-time on reddis although Reddit
03:59 - remains at as BSD licensed subsequently
04:02 - VMware hired some of the other
04:04 - developers who also contributed majorly
04:08 - to assist on the project so this was a
04:11 - brief introduction about redis and from
04:14 - the next video we will see how we can
04:16 - install redis and how to use redis so
04:20 - stay tuned and please rate comment
04:22 - subscribe and bye for now
