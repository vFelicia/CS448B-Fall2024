08:39 - which is going to open this kind of
08:42 - window which is called registry editor
08:44 - window
08:45 - now here

won't see this problem but in my version and at the time of making this video this problem arises so let me show you how you can fix this problem so for fixing this problem you just need to close this window and then click on yes and then you can once again close this window and then click on power of the machine and once you click on the power of the machine option you just need to select this windows 11 once again and then click on start once again now once you see this window in your virtual box when you install windows 11 at this point you need to press shift f10 key okay so just press shift and the f10 key together which is going to open this command line right once this command line opens you need to type reg edit reg edit i'm going to put each and every command in the description of this video so you can see which command you need to uh give in order to follow this video right so just type reg edit here and then press enter which is going to open this kind of window which is called registry editor window now here in the h key local machine option so just expand this option you will be able to see system option so just expand this also and then you will be able to see setup options so just expand this setup option also now on the setup you just need to right click here and then click on new and then click on key here and then just name it as lab config so just type l a b c o n f i g okay so make sure your lab config looks similar to what i have typed with the capital l and capital c and then press enter which is going to create this key for you now once you have created this key just click on this lab config key and on the right hand side just right click here and then click on new and then select d word 32 value and name this value as bypass tpm check and make sure you spelled the bypass tpm check as i have done with the capital b d p m and c right and then press enter once this key is created just right click on it once again and then click on modify and here in the value data you need to change it to one instead of zero here okay so make sure that you enter value data is equal to one and then click on ok once this is done right click on this window once again and then new and then select divert 32 bit value once again and this time we are going to name this value as bypass secure boot check and then click on enter once this key is created once again we will modify this value and we will just give the data value to 1 and then click on ok right so basically we have created two values one is bypass tpm check and other is bypass secure boot check and we have given the value one here in both uh the keys right basically what it's going to do is it's going to bypass the tpm check and the secure boot check so once that's done you can close this window and also you can close the command prompt and here you can start the installation process again so you can choose the language to install time and currency format you can also choose the keyboard input method in my case i'm going to choose here german and then click on next and then i'm going to click on install and in here you need to provide the product key so i'm going to just
