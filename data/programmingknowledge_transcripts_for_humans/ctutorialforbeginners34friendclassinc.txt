00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you what are friend classes and how
00:06 - to use friend classes in
00:09 - C++ so in principle we know that we
00:13 - cannot use private or protected members
00:17 - of class outside the class so for
00:21 - example we have a class called my class
00:25 - and it has a private member variable
00:29 - called
00:30 - secret and we all know that if we
00:33 - declare
00:35 - this uh variable in this private under
00:39 - this private access modifier we cannot
00:43 - use this outside the
00:45 - class now
00:48 - sometimes we need to use this uh private
00:52 - members of the class in other
00:55 - classes and in this case we use friend
01:00 - classes or friend
01:02 - keyword so let me give you an example
01:06 - first so we have this uh
01:09 - my class which has a private member CL
01:13 - called secret right let's declare
01:16 - another
01:19 - class which I
01:22 - call
01:27 - my another class for
01:32 - example
01:34 - and this class wants to access the
01:38 - secret variable which is private so we
01:41 - all know that we cannot use this right
01:45 - so for example there is a
01:51 - public public
01:54 - uh member function in this my another
01:58 - class and we can call it anything for
02:02 - [Music]
02:04 - example
02:07 - void uh
02:10 - [Music]
02:15 - show
02:19 - secret okay so this is a function and
02:23 - let's give it an argument so I will pass
02:28 - my first class here as an argument okay
02:32 - because I want to use the secret uh in
02:36 - my second class so and I will call it my
02:42 - or MC for my
02:45 - class
02:46 - and then I want to use this for example
02:51 - I want to use so this is MCC is the
02:55 - object of the class as you all know that
02:58 - we can create a instance over class but
03:01 - when we uh want to access the secret uh
03:05 - variable which is a private uh variable
03:08 - in my class so when I write Dot and when
03:12 - I write mc. secret and when I try to
03:17 - compile this let's see what
03:20 - happens and it gives us an error and
03:24 - what is the
03:26 - error so this error is within this
03:30 - context so my class secret is private
03:33 - within this context which is true and
03:37 - which is also we know by definition that
03:40 - we cannot use private members of a class
03:44 - in another class right but for example
03:48 - for some reason you want to use this
03:50 - private member in your another class how
03:55 - can you do it you just need to
03:58 - declare
04:01 - that the class in which you want to use
04:04 - the private member you just need to copy
04:07 - the name of this um class so be because
04:12 - my another class wants to use the
04:15 - private member in the first class called
04:19 - my class right so I need to declare this
04:23 - my another class as a friend of this my
04:26 - class so why what I can do I can just
04:29 - write a keyword
04:32 - called friend and then
04:37 - class and then the class name for which
04:41 - I want to make the friend or make this
04:45 - friend okay so if you
04:48 - declare in your first class that this
04:51 - another class my another class is the
04:55 - friend of this class then this keyword
05:00 - allows you to access the private member
05:05 - by this class so now if if you declare
05:08 - that my another class is a friend of my
05:12 - class then my another class has the
05:16 - access to the private members of the
05:19 - class okay so I'm going to build it and
05:24 - hopefully it will not show any
05:27 - error and it doesn't show any error
05:31 - okay so for example I have the value for
05:34 - secret is equal to
05:38 - 10 and I want to set this value to some
05:42 - another value I can set it right so I
05:46 - can do Plus+ for example in this
05:51 - function and then what I can do I can
05:55 - simply call the instance of this class
05:59 - here
06:00 - my another class right
06:03 - and I can
06:06 - say
06:07 - uh m a c for my another class which is
06:13 - the object and then I can declare the
06:16 - instance of my class which is my first
06:18 - class which is MC for example and then I
06:22 - can call this function using Mac from my
06:26 - another class show Secret do show sequit
06:31 - right and it takes an argument which is
06:34 - the instance of the
06:38 - class which we have this private member
06:41 - in right so just copy this instance
06:47 - here and
06:49 - then you will be able to see
06:53 - the value of the secret so for example I
06:58 - can see out here
07:00 - or
07:03 - STD C
07:06 - out and I
07:08 - can just print the value of this
07:12 - okay and stb
07:17 - col and L
07:21 - okay so now I will compile the program
07:24 - and then I will run the program it
07:27 - compiles fine run it and it so shows the
07:30 - value of the secret is 11 right which is
07:34 - true because we set the value of secret
07:37 - as 10 and we are increasing this to +
07:41 - one and now the value is 11 so the basic
07:45 - thing is whenever you want to use a
07:49 - private or protected members from one
07:54 - class to another class you need to use
07:57 - friend keyword or friend friend class
08:01 - keyword of the class in which you want
08:04 - to
08:05 - use uh this private members okay so for
08:10 - example this is the class in which you
08:12 - want to use the private member of my
08:15 - class then you need to give uh this
08:18 - keyword friend class my class so that
08:23 - this my class knows that my another
08:27 - class is a friend of this class so I can
08:30 - use these private members from the other
08:35 - class okay so this is the basic concept
08:39 - I hope you have enjoyed the video please

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you what are friend classes and how to use friend classes in C++ so in principle we know that we cannot use private or protected members of class outside the class so for example we have a class called my class and it has a private member variable called secret and we all know that if we declare this uh variable in this private under this private access modifier we cannot use this outside the class now sometimes we need to use this uh private members of the class in other classes and in this case we use friend classes or friend keyword so let me give you an example first so we have this uh my class which has a private member CL called secret right let's declare another class which I call my another class for example and this class wants to access the secret variable which is private so we all know that we cannot use this right so for example there is a public public uh member function in this my another class and we can call it anything for example void uh show secret okay so this is a function and let's give it an argument so I will pass my first class here as an argument okay because I want to use the secret uh in my second class so and I will call it my or MC for my class and then I want to use this for example I want to use so this is MCC is the object of the class as you all know that we can create a instance over class but when we uh want to access the secret uh variable which is a private uh variable in my class so when I write Dot and when I write mc. secret and when I try to compile this let's see what happens and it gives us an error and what is the error so this error is within this context so my class secret is private within this context which is true and which is also we know by definition that we cannot use private members of a class in another class right but for example for some reason you want to use this private member in your another class how can you do it you just need to declare that the class in which you want to use the private member you just need to copy the name of this um class so be because my another class wants to use the private member in the first class called my class right so I need to declare this my another class as a friend of this my class so why what I can do I can just write a keyword called friend and then class and then the class name for which I want to make the friend or make this friend okay so if you declare in your first class that this another class my another class is the friend of this class then this keyword allows you to access the private member by this class so now if if you declare that my another class is a friend of my class then my another class has the access to the private members of the class okay so I'm going to build it and hopefully it will not show any error and it doesn't show any error okay so for example I have the value for secret is equal to 10 and I want to set this value to some another value I can set it right so I can do Plus+ for example in this function and then what I can do I can simply call the instance of this class here my another class right and I can say uh m a c for my another class which is the object and then I can declare the instance of my class which is my first class which is MC for example and then I can call this function using Mac from my another class show Secret do show sequit right and it takes an argument which is the instance of the class which we have this private member in right so just copy this instance here and then you will be able to see the value of the secret so for example I can see out here or STD C out and I can just print the value of this okay and stb col and L okay so now I will compile the program and then I will run the program it compiles fine run it and it so shows the value of the secret is 11 right which is true because we set the value of secret as 10 and we are increasing this to + one and now the value is 11 so the basic thing is whenever you want to use a private or protected members from one class to another class you need to use friend keyword or friend friend class keyword of the class in which you want to use uh this private members okay so for example this is the class in which you want to use the private member of my class then you need to give uh this keyword friend class my class so that this my class knows that my another class is a friend of this class so I can use these private members from the other class okay so this is the basic concept I hope you have enjoyed the video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
