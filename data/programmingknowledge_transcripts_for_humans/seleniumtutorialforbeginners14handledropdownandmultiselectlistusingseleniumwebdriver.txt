00:00 - hello everyone this is varsha and
00:01 - welcome to programming knowledge
00:09 - so today we are going to learn about the
00:10 - drop down menus now
00:12 - basically a drop down menu is a menu
00:14 - that offers a list of options
00:16 - and we can select one value at a time
00:19 - for example
00:20 - here you can see this is the drop down
00:22 - menu i can select any one value at a
00:24 - time
00:25 - so this is called a drop down menu now
00:27 - we will handle the drop down menus with
00:30 - the help of
00:31 - a special class called as a select class
00:34 - because
00:34 - here you can see when i inspect this
00:36 - element i can see the select
00:38 - tag so that is the reason why to inspect
00:41 - this to select
00:42 - values in this drop down menu i will be
00:44 - using the select class
00:46 - now the basic syntax of select class is
00:48 - that select i'll create a reference of
00:50 - this
00:50 - new is equal to new select and i will
00:53 - specify my web element over here
00:55 - so this is the syntax of select class
00:57 - next there are different methods of
00:58 - select class we'll be covering all these
01:00 - methods that is select by index
01:02 - select by value select by visible text
01:06 - deselect by index deselect by value
01:08 - deselect by visible text
01:10 - get options get all selected options and
01:12 - get first selected options
01:14 - the deselect by value deselect by index
01:17 - and deselect by visible text
01:19 - only works for the multi select box so
01:22 - what is multiselectbox we will cover
01:23 - that also
01:26 - now there are different types of drop
01:27 - down menus and we will be learning how
01:29 - to inspect all these menus
01:31 - the first is a drop down menu with a
01:33 - select class we have seen that example
01:35 - now
01:36 - next is the drop down menu with the
01:37 - multi select options and then there is a
01:40 - drop down menu with a bootstrap
01:43 - so uh here you can see this is a drop
01:46 - down menu
01:47 - with select class here you can see there
01:49 - is select tag
01:50 - and this is the multi select i can
01:52 - select multiple values over here okay
01:54 - so this is the multi select list so
01:56 - we'll be inspecting these two lists
01:58 - first and then we will learn how to
01:59 - inspect the bootstrap list
02:01 - now when we are inspecting the drop down
02:03 - menu the first thing that we'll do is
02:05 - first we'll find how many options are
02:07 - present in the drop down
02:08 - menu we will extract all those options
02:10 - and then we will select the
02:12 - options from the drop down menu through
02:13 - through three methods
02:15 - the first is select by index select by
02:18 - value and then select by visible text
02:20 - okay so just open your intelligent idea
02:23 - id first now i have already created a
02:26 - java class i have named it as selenium
02:28 - tutorials under package com.selenium
02:31 - and i have given three commas that is
02:33 - open the chrome browser i have given the
02:35 - key that is the webdriver.chrome.driver
02:37 - and the value that is the executable
02:39 - chrome driver file
02:41 - then next i have written webdriver
02:43 - driver is equal to new chrome driver
02:44 - here i'm launching the chrome browser
02:47 - next i'm navigating to the urls i've
02:48 - specified the url over here
02:51 - this is the page that we will inspect
02:53 - first i will inspect the drop down menu
02:55 - and then we will select the
02:57 - multi select list okay and then i'm
02:59 - maximizing the browser
03:01 - now first to handle drop down menu first
03:04 - we will use a select class
03:06 - over here i am going to write select
03:08 - i'll create a reference variable so i'll
03:09 - write select
03:10 - element new select and here i will
03:14 - specify the web element
03:15 - now there are two options over here
03:16 - either i write driver
03:19 - dot find element by dot
03:23 - x path and i will specify the x path
03:25 - over here i will inspect this element
03:28 - here it is and here in selectors up i
03:31 - can see the relative xpath i'll copy
03:33 - this
03:33 - this is the first option the second
03:36 - option is
03:37 - the second option is if i copy this i'll
03:40 - simply cop
03:41 - i'll just copy this and i'll give a
03:43 - variable that is the web element
03:46 - i'll write your drop down
03:49 - is equal to driver dot find elements by
03:52 - dot x path and this is the x bar that i
03:54 - have given over here
03:56 - and here i'll write select then i'll
03:59 - write select
04:00 - element i'll give a reference variable
04:02 - i'm just showing you the different ways
04:04 - you can use the select class
04:06 - then new select and here i will specify
04:09 - drop down that is the web element
04:12 - variable that i have created over here
04:14 - okay so these are the two methods you
04:16 - can use the select class i prefer this
04:18 - one
04:19 - so i'll just comment this
04:22 - and we will continue with this one okay
04:24 - so you have written select i've created
04:26 - a
04:26 - reference variable that is a select
04:28 - element is equal to new select
04:30 - and i have specified the web element
04:32 - that is the location of the drop down
04:34 - menu
04:34 - now here after creating a
04:38 - select class we will find how many
04:40 - options are present in the drop down
04:42 - menu
04:42 - so here i'm going to write select
04:44 - element dot
04:46 - get options okay so your
04:50 - get options belongs to the select tag
04:52 - and
04:53 - through this option we will retrieve all
04:55 - the options that are present in the drop
04:57 - down menu okay
04:59 - now here i will store it in a list type
05:01 - of a web element
05:03 - i will name this web element as options
05:05 - and is equal to select
05:06 - element dot get options now here i will
05:10 - print
05:11 - so i'll write s out i'll write
05:14 - options dot size
05:18 - now why i'm using the size function over
05:20 - here is because i want to return the
05:22 - number of elements in the list i want to
05:24 - see how many number of elements are
05:25 - present in the list okay
05:28 - then we will extract the values so let's
05:30 - run this
05:33 - my chrome browser is launched it's
05:36 - navigated
05:38 - it's maximized
05:41 - here there is no value displayed because
05:43 - we are not selecting any value right now
05:46 - we have just seen there are total eight
05:48 - elements that are present over here
05:50 - let's check if i inspect this
05:54 - here there is eight element that is one
05:56 - two three four
05:57 - five six seven eight there are total
06:00 - eight elements that is present over here
06:02 - okay here you can see it so the next is
06:05 - that we have to
06:06 - print them so for that we will be using
06:08 - the for each loop
06:09 - here i have written for and over here
06:12 - because i'm inspecting the web element
06:13 - so i'll write the web element
06:15 - and i'll give it as i'll give a variable
06:17 - as e
06:19 - and you're because i have to
06:22 - print the options that are present so
06:25 - i'll write options over here
06:27 - and then i'll write a system.out.println
06:32 - i'll write the values r and here i'll
06:35 - write
06:35 - e dot e dot get text
06:38 - so let's execute this my chrome
06:40 - browser's launched
06:41 - it's navigated it's maximized and here
06:44 - you can see the values that is there
06:46 - please select then we have sunday monday
06:49 - tuesday wednesday thursday friday
06:50 - saturday
06:51 - and year also we can see these value
06:54 - please select sunday monday tuesday
06:55 - wednesday thursday friday saturday
06:59 - okay so these are the values we have
07:00 - printed the values now
07:02 - now i want to select them
07:07 - i want to select these options okay so
07:09 - there are three methods to select these
07:11 - options
07:12 - the first is select by index then it is
07:14 - select by value
07:16 - and next is select by visible text these
07:18 - are the different types of methods to
07:20 - which we will select the options in the
07:22 - drop down menu
07:23 - okay now let's use first
07:27 - select by value now here select by value
07:31 - when i inspect this element
07:33 - i can see option value there are
07:35 - different types of values given over
07:37 - here
07:37 - that is the sunday monday tuesday
07:40 - wednesday thursday friday saturday
07:42 - here it is with option value friday
07:45 - right so
07:45 - i'll be using this value to select this
07:48 - option so for example if i use
07:51 - friday i'll write
07:54 - select element dot
07:58 - select by value and i'll specify the
08:01 - value over here
08:02 - friday okay now let's
08:05 - run this my chrome browser is launched
08:09 - it's navigated it's maximized and here
08:11 - you can see the friday is selected
08:13 - here you can see they selected friday
08:17 - the values are printed we have got the
08:19 - total number of values that is eight and
08:21 - then the values are also printed
08:23 - and friday is selected this is the first
08:26 - method
08:27 - the next method is select by
08:31 - index now for example suppose if i want
08:35 - to select
08:36 - tuesday okay and these are the options
08:38 - that are present over here
08:39 - to select by index it starts from zero
08:41 - so this will be zero
08:43 - one two three tuesday will be three so
08:46 - i'll be writing
08:47 - three over here so first i'll write
08:49 - select
08:50 - element dot select by index and i'll
08:53 - specify
08:54 - three over here now let's run this
08:58 - my chrome browser is launched it's
09:01 - navigated
09:02 - it's maximized and here you can see the
09:04 - day selected is tuesday
09:06 - okay so the next method is
09:10 - select by visible text
09:14 - okay over here visible text
09:18 - means if when i am inspecting this
09:20 - element the text that is visible over
09:22 - here here you can see there is text
09:23 - sunday
09:24 - monday tuesday now it is not necessary
09:28 - if the value
09:29 - and the text that is visible here is the
09:31 - same
09:32 - okay here in this case it is same but it
09:35 - is not
09:36 - like it is not compulsory that the value
09:39 - and the visible text is same so for
09:42 - example now if i want to select monday
09:44 - so i will just copy this visible text
09:47 - monday over here
09:48 - and i'll paste it over here i'll write
09:50 - select dot
09:52 - select by visible text
09:56 - and i will paste it over here i'll
09:59 - comment this
10:00 - and i will execute this my chrome
10:03 - browser
10:04 - is launched
10:07 - it's navigated and here you can see the
10:09 - day selected is
10:11 - monday so now these are the different
10:13 - ways through which we can select these
10:14 - options
10:15 - now if in the interviews they ask how to
10:17 - handle drop down menus i have divided
10:19 - this answer into different steps
10:21 - so the first step is that to handle the
10:23 - drop down menu we will use the select
10:25 - class
10:26 - so first we will create a variable of
10:28 - web element type
10:29 - and pass it as a parameter in the select
10:31 - class as we have done in the example
10:33 - before
10:34 - i have created a variable of web element
10:36 - that is the d
10:37 - and driver.fine element by dot id and
10:39 - have specified the
10:40 - location of the drop down menu over here
10:42 - next i have created a select class
10:45 - i have also created a reference variable
10:48 - of this that is the drop down list
10:50 - is equal to new select and i have passed
10:53 - the
10:53 - parameter of web element type that is
10:55 - the d over here in the select class
10:57 - now this is the first method the second
10:59 - method is that if we see if we write
11:01 - select drop down list is equal to new
11:02 - select and we write driver dot fine
11:04 - element directly to v right driver dot
11:06 - fine element
11:07 - that is also fine okay
11:10 - then the next step is that we will find
11:12 - how many options are present in the drop
11:13 - down menu
11:14 - to find that we will write drop down
11:16 - list dot get options dot size
11:18 - now we can extract all the options in
11:20 - the drop down menu in the selenium with
11:22 - the help of select class method which
11:24 - has the get options method
11:25 - now this drives all the options of the
11:27 - select tag and it returns a list
11:29 - of web element types okay get options
11:32 - returns the list of web element types
11:34 - just remember that now we will extract
11:36 - all the options
11:37 - we will print them for printing them we
11:39 - are using the for loop and for
11:40 - extracting we use the
11:43 - dropdownlist.getoptions method
11:45 - and we printed it next is that we
11:48 - selected options from drop down menu
11:50 - through three ways
11:51 - first is select by index then select by
11:54 - value then select by visible text
11:56 - so here uh select by index you can use
11:59 - the index to select the option
12:00 - from a drop down menu basically the
12:03 - index starts for zero
12:04 - so this means the first option index
12:06 - will be zero and so on okay
12:08 - now if we write select by index we will
12:10 - writing uh we will write select
12:12 - dot select by index we will specify the
12:15 - index over here
12:16 - okay next is the select by value you can
12:19 - select an option by using the value
12:21 - attribute provided for
12:23 - each option in the drop down menu in the
12:25 - drop down menu there is an option that
12:27 - is
12:27 - a value attribute provided so using that
12:30 - value attribute you can
12:32 - uh select the option through select by
12:34 - value
12:35 - okay simply just write select dot select
12:37 - by value
12:38 - and the value you want to select for
12:40 - example in the value it is given options
12:43 - value is equal to 4
12:44 - so your specify 4 now select by visible
12:47 - text
12:48 - you can use the visible text to select
12:50 - the options so if you want to select
12:52 - 2015
12:53 - you can select the option by visible
12:55 - text that is 2015 will be written over
12:58 - there
12:58 - okay so just simply write select dot
13:01 - select by visible text and specify the
13:03 - text that is visible over there so these
13:05 - are the three ways where you can
13:07 - uh handle the uh drop down menu options
13:10 - you can select these options
13:11 - through these three ways okay now as i
13:15 - specified this is the index that is
13:17 - selecting by
13:17 - index it will start from zero uh this is
13:20 - the select by uh visible text and this
13:23 - is select by value there is option value
13:25 - attribute that has been used over here
13:27 - so you will be using the select
13:29 - by value now over here we will
13:32 - understand what is the multi select drop
13:34 - down list
13:35 - a multi select drop down list control
13:37 - allows the user to select multiple items
13:40 - from the list
13:41 - to check if the select element supports
13:43 - the multiple selecting options at the
13:45 - same time or not we will use
13:47 - is multiple method this returns a
13:50 - boolean value that is true or false
13:52 - now here you can see this example there
13:54 - is multiple
13:55 - uh options are selected so this is
13:58 - called a multi select drop down box
14:00 - now that is multiple method for example
14:02 - over here
14:03 - this box is not multi-selected box right
14:07 - so if i write
14:11 - select element dot is multiple
14:15 - and i store this in a boolean type of a
14:16 - variable
14:18 - and let me print this variable so it
14:21 - will return true or false now in this
14:22 - case it will return false because it is
14:24 - not a multi select
14:26 - box so i will write and i will print it
14:30 - so let's execute this
14:33 - chrome browser's launch is navigated and
14:35 - maximized and here you can see the
14:37 - selected day is monday
14:39 - and the output for this is false why
14:42 - because it is not supporting multiple
14:44 - select it is not a multiple select drop
14:47 - down menu this is a multiple select drop
14:48 - down menu so we'll be using
14:51 - is multiple method in this and the
14:52 - answer for this will be true
14:55 - now to select multiple values in a drop
14:58 - down box
14:59 - i'll create a new java class
15:03 - i'll name it as selenium
15:06 - tutorials 16. now i'll simply
15:10 - copy this till printing the values
15:15 - [Music]
15:18 - now first i'm launching the chrome
15:19 - browser i'm opening the url maximizing
15:21 - the page
15:22 - i'm creating a select class i'll change
15:24 - the x path over here
15:28 - i will inspect so this is it i'll copy
15:31 - this relative x path over here
15:33 - i'll paste it over here then i'm finding
15:36 - the options present in the drop down
15:38 - menu
15:39 - it will print the number of options and
15:41 - then it will print
15:42 - the values of the options so let's
15:46 - execute this
15:48 - now my chrome browser is launched it's
15:52 - maximized and here i can see the total
15:55 - values are eight and the values of
15:57 - california florida new jersey new york
16:00 - texas these are the values that is
16:02 - present over here now if i want to
16:04 - select them
16:05 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to use
16:07 - we'll be using
16:08 - those options only that is a select by
16:10 - value select by index select by visible
16:13 - but there is something different in this
16:15 - that is a deselect
16:16 - now let's first see if this is a multi
16:19 - select box or not
16:20 - so if i'll write first i'll use is
16:22 - multiple method
16:24 - i'll write select element dot is
16:26 - multiple
16:28 - i'll store this in a boolean type of a
16:30 - variable
16:32 - i'll print it and let's run this
16:37 - my chrome browser is launched it's
16:38 - navigated it's maximized
16:41 - and here you will see it's true so this
16:43 - is a multi select box
16:45 - and now let's select elements
16:48 - so now we will select the value so i'll
16:51 - write
16:52 - first we will use select
16:56 - by index so i'll write select
16:59 - element dot select by index
17:02 - and i want to select this
17:06 - the first index itself so this the index
17:08 - starts with zero so this is the zeroth
17:10 - index that is the california so i'll
17:13 - write
17:13 - zero over here next we will use the
17:16 - select
17:18 - by value method i'll write
17:22 - select element dot select by value
17:26 - your value for new york is new york
17:29 - so i'll just copy this
17:32 - and i will paste it over here now next
17:35 - is that select by
17:39 - visible text
17:42 - so i'll write select element dot
17:46 - select by visible text and i will
17:49 - write the visible text that is present
17:50 - over here for
17:52 - washington it is washington
17:56 - so i'll just copy this washington
18:00 - and let's see whether it's selecting or
18:02 - not so i'll just run this command
18:04 - so my chrome browser is launched it's
18:06 - navigated
18:08 - it's maximized and here you can see
18:11 - there are three values that is selected
18:13 - that is the california
18:14 - new york and washington okay
18:18 - now if i want to know which is the first
18:21 - selected value
18:22 - so i'll write select element dot get
18:26 - first selected option dot
18:29 - get text i will write this in
18:34 - s out i want to print this so i'll write
18:38 - system.out.println select
18:39 - element.getfirst selected option dot
18:42 - get text now the first
18:45 - get first selected option returns the
18:47 - first selected option in the select tag
18:49 - here you can see it is the first
18:51 - selected option in the select text and
18:53 - if we don't find it it will throw the
18:55 - exception no such element exception if
18:57 - the option is not selected
19:00 - so let's execute this
19:04 - my chrome browser is launched it's
19:08 - navigated
19:10 - so the options are selected
19:15 - the first option that we have selected
19:16 - is california over here you can see the
19:18 - index that we have given zero
19:20 - so the first option that is selected
19:22 - over here is california
19:23 - okay now let's deselect the values
19:27 - for that we'll be using three commas at
19:30 - the deselect by index
19:31 - deselect by value and deselect by
19:33 - visible text
19:34 - so first i'll write select
19:38 - element dot deselect
19:42 - by index okay now i want to deselect
19:46 - new york because i have selected new
19:47 - york so i will be writing 0
19:50 - 1 2 new york is the third index so i'll
19:53 - write three
19:56 - now here i'll write thread dot sleep
19:59 - let me give some time
20:02 - and let's execute this micro browser is
20:06 - launched
20:07 - it's navigated it's maximized
20:10 - and the values are selected california
20:12 - new york and washington and we saw the
20:14 - new york got
20:15 - deselected now next
20:18 - we will use the next method that is
20:22 - deselect
20:23 - [Music]
20:25 - by value so i'll write select element
20:28 - dot
20:28 - deselect by value now
20:32 - i want to deselect washington
20:35 - so the value of washington is washington
20:37 - so i'll simply copy this
20:39 - and paste it over here okay now let's
20:43 - execute this
20:45 - my chrome browser is launched it's
20:47 - navigated
20:48 - it's maximized and here you can see the
20:50 - three values that is selected
20:52 - and the new york and washington is
20:54 - deselected
20:58 - okay now we will use deselect
21:01 - by visible text so i'll write
21:05 - select element dot deselect by visible
21:08 - text
21:11 - and here i'll specify i will
21:15 - now here i want to deselect the
21:16 - california so the visible text that is
21:19 - present over here is california
21:21 - so i'll copy this
21:25 - paste it over here and let's run this
21:30 - the chrome browser is launched
21:34 - [Music]
21:35 - it's navigated it's maximized and those
21:38 - three values are selected
21:41 - the new york and washington is
21:43 - deselected
21:45 - okay so here i've used so here i'll
21:48 - write select element dot
21:50 - deselect by visible text and url paste
21:54 - california okay now so run this
21:58 - launch the chrome browser and
22:01 - maximize the web page and these are the
22:03 - three elements that is selected
22:04 - california new york and
22:06 - washington and all are deselected now
22:09 - over here the deselect option works only
22:11 - with the multi select boxes
22:14 - it does not work with the normal drop
22:16 - down box that we have it works only for
22:18 - the multi select for example if i
22:20 - work for the multi select box the
22:22 - deselect option then
22:24 - in that case for example over here
22:30 - i am selecting monday so in this case
22:33 - what will happen if i write
22:35 - select element dot deselect
22:39 - by visible text and here i'll specify
22:43 - monday itself
22:47 - so it will show an error so my chrome
22:50 - browser is launched
22:52 - it's navigated
22:55 - it's maximized and here you can see the
22:58 - date selected is monday
23:01 - [Music]
23:03 - but it shows an exception over here
23:06 - while deselecting monday
23:07 - shows an exception it says that you may
23:10 - only deselect options of a multi select
23:14 - okay so the deselect option works only
23:16 - for the multi select drop down menus and
23:18 - not for the
23:19 - drop down menus with the select class
23:21 - okay
23:23 - so these are the different types of
23:25 - methods that we learnt today
23:27 - that is the select by value select by
23:30 - index select by visible text and
23:32 - deselect by value deselect by
23:34 - index and deselect by visible text also
23:36 - we learned
23:37 - uh the option that is the get for
23:40 - selected options now this works for
23:42 - validation
23:42 - then we have learned the method that is
23:44 - the guest get first selected option also
23:47 - so these are the different types of
23:48 - methods that is supported by the select
23:50 - class
23:51 - so this is all for now in the next class
23:53 - we will learn how to inspect the
23:56 - bootstrap drop down menu so please like
23:59 - share and subscribe this video and thank
24:02 - you
24:07 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone this is varsha and welcome to programming knowledge so today we are going to learn about the drop down menus now basically a drop down menu is a menu that offers a list of options and we can select one value at a time for example here you can see this is the drop down menu i can select any one value at a time so this is called a drop down menu now we will handle the drop down menus with the help of a special class called as a select class because here you can see when i inspect this element i can see the select tag so that is the reason why to inspect this to select values in this drop down menu i will be using the select class now the basic syntax of select class is that select i'll create a reference of this new is equal to new select and i will specify my web element over here so this is the syntax of select class next there are different methods of select class we'll be covering all these methods that is select by index select by value select by visible text deselect by index deselect by value deselect by visible text get options get all selected options and get first selected options the deselect by value deselect by index and deselect by visible text only works for the multi select box so what is multiselectbox we will cover that also now there are different types of drop down menus and we will be learning how to inspect all these menus the first is a drop down menu with a select class we have seen that example now next is the drop down menu with the multi select options and then there is a drop down menu with a bootstrap so uh here you can see this is a drop down menu with select class here you can see there is select tag and this is the multi select i can select multiple values over here okay so this is the multi select list so we'll be inspecting these two lists first and then we will learn how to inspect the bootstrap list now when we are inspecting the drop down menu the first thing that we'll do is first we'll find how many options are present in the drop down menu we will extract all those options and then we will select the options from the drop down menu through through three methods the first is select by index select by value and then select by visible text okay so just open your intelligent idea id first now i have already created a java class i have named it as selenium tutorials under package com.selenium and i have given three commas that is open the chrome browser i have given the key that is the webdriver.chrome.driver and the value that is the executable chrome driver file then next i have written webdriver driver is equal to new chrome driver here i'm launching the chrome browser next i'm navigating to the urls i've specified the url over here this is the page that we will inspect first i will inspect the drop down menu and then we will select the multi select list okay and then i'm maximizing the browser now first to handle drop down menu first we will use a select class over here i am going to write select i'll create a reference variable so i'll write select element new select and here i will specify the web element now there are two options over here either i write driver dot find element by dot x path and i will specify the x path over here i will inspect this element here it is and here in selectors up i can see the relative xpath i'll copy this this is the first option the second option is the second option is if i copy this i'll simply cop i'll just copy this and i'll give a variable that is the web element i'll write your drop down is equal to driver dot find elements by dot x path and this is the x bar that i have given over here and here i'll write select then i'll write select element i'll give a reference variable i'm just showing you the different ways you can use the select class then new select and here i will specify drop down that is the web element variable that i have created over here okay so these are the two methods you can use the select class i prefer this one so i'll just comment this and we will continue with this one okay so you have written select i've created a reference variable that is a select element is equal to new select and i have specified the web element that is the location of the drop down menu now here after creating a select class we will find how many options are present in the drop down menu so here i'm going to write select element dot get options okay so your get options belongs to the select tag and through this option we will retrieve all the options that are present in the drop down menu okay now here i will store it in a list type of a web element i will name this web element as options and is equal to select element dot get options now here i will print so i'll write s out i'll write options dot size now why i'm using the size function over here is because i want to return the number of elements in the list i want to see how many number of elements are present in the list okay then we will extract the values so let's run this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized here there is no value displayed because we are not selecting any value right now we have just seen there are total eight elements that are present over here let's check if i inspect this here there is eight element that is one two three four five six seven eight there are total eight elements that is present over here okay here you can see it so the next is that we have to print them so for that we will be using the for each loop here i have written for and over here because i'm inspecting the web element so i'll write the web element and i'll give it as i'll give a variable as e and you're because i have to print the options that are present so i'll write options over here and then i'll write a system.out.println i'll write the values r and here i'll write e dot e dot get text so let's execute this my chrome browser's launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the values that is there please select then we have sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and year also we can see these value please select sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday okay so these are the values we have printed the values now now i want to select them i want to select these options okay so there are three methods to select these options the first is select by index then it is select by value and next is select by visible text these are the different types of methods to which we will select the options in the drop down menu okay now let's use first select by value now here select by value when i inspect this element i can see option value there are different types of values given over here that is the sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday here it is with option value friday right so i'll be using this value to select this option so for example if i use friday i'll write select element dot select by value and i'll specify the value over here friday okay now let's run this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the friday is selected here you can see they selected friday the values are printed we have got the total number of values that is eight and then the values are also printed and friday is selected this is the first method the next method is select by index now for example suppose if i want to select tuesday okay and these are the options that are present over here to select by index it starts from zero so this will be zero one two three tuesday will be three so i'll be writing three over here so first i'll write select element dot select by index and i'll specify three over here now let's run this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the day selected is tuesday okay so the next method is select by visible text okay over here visible text means if when i am inspecting this element the text that is visible over here here you can see there is text sunday monday tuesday now it is not necessary if the value and the text that is visible here is the same okay here in this case it is same but it is not like it is not compulsory that the value and the visible text is same so for example now if i want to select monday so i will just copy this visible text monday over here and i'll paste it over here i'll write select dot select by visible text and i will paste it over here i'll comment this and i will execute this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated and here you can see the day selected is monday so now these are the different ways through which we can select these options now if in the interviews they ask how to handle drop down menus i have divided this answer into different steps so the first step is that to handle the drop down menu we will use the select class so first we will create a variable of web element type and pass it as a parameter in the select class as we have done in the example before i have created a variable of web element that is the d and driver.fine element by dot id and have specified the location of the drop down menu over here next i have created a select class i have also created a reference variable of this that is the drop down list is equal to new select and i have passed the parameter of web element type that is the d over here in the select class now this is the first method the second method is that if we see if we write select drop down list is equal to new select and we write driver dot fine element directly to v right driver dot fine element that is also fine okay then the next step is that we will find how many options are present in the drop down menu to find that we will write drop down list dot get options dot size now we can extract all the options in the drop down menu in the selenium with the help of select class method which has the get options method now this drives all the options of the select tag and it returns a list of web element types okay get options returns the list of web element types just remember that now we will extract all the options we will print them for printing them we are using the for loop and for extracting we use the dropdownlist.getoptions method and we printed it next is that we selected options from drop down menu through three ways first is select by index then select by value then select by visible text so here uh select by index you can use the index to select the option from a drop down menu basically the index starts for zero so this means the first option index will be zero and so on okay now if we write select by index we will writing uh we will write select dot select by index we will specify the index over here okay next is the select by value you can select an option by using the value attribute provided for each option in the drop down menu in the drop down menu there is an option that is a value attribute provided so using that value attribute you can uh select the option through select by value okay simply just write select dot select by value and the value you want to select for example in the value it is given options value is equal to 4 so your specify 4 now select by visible text you can use the visible text to select the options so if you want to select 2015 you can select the option by visible text that is 2015 will be written over there okay so just simply write select dot select by visible text and specify the text that is visible over there so these are the three ways where you can uh handle the uh drop down menu options you can select these options through these three ways okay now as i specified this is the index that is selecting by index it will start from zero uh this is the select by uh visible text and this is select by value there is option value attribute that has been used over here so you will be using the select by value now over here we will understand what is the multi select drop down list a multi select drop down list control allows the user to select multiple items from the list to check if the select element supports the multiple selecting options at the same time or not we will use is multiple method this returns a boolean value that is true or false now here you can see this example there is multiple uh options are selected so this is called a multi select drop down box now that is multiple method for example over here this box is not multiselected box right so if i write select element dot is multiple and i store this in a boolean type of a variable and let me print this variable so it will return true or false now in this case it will return false because it is not a multi select box so i will write and i will print it so let's execute this chrome browser's launch is navigated and maximized and here you can see the selected day is monday and the output for this is false why because it is not supporting multiple select it is not a multiple select drop down menu this is a multiple select drop down menu so we'll be using is multiple method in this and the answer for this will be true now to select multiple values in a drop down box i'll create a new java class i'll name it as selenium tutorials 16. now i'll simply copy this till printing the values now first i'm launching the chrome browser i'm opening the url maximizing the page i'm creating a select class i'll change the x path over here i will inspect so this is it i'll copy this relative x path over here i'll paste it over here then i'm finding the options present in the drop down menu it will print the number of options and then it will print the values of the options so let's execute this now my chrome browser is launched it's maximized and here i can see the total values are eight and the values of california florida new jersey new york texas these are the values that is present over here now if i want to select them what i'm going to do is i'm going to use we'll be using those options only that is a select by value select by index select by visible but there is something different in this that is a deselect now let's first see if this is a multi select box or not so if i'll write first i'll use is multiple method i'll write select element dot is multiple i'll store this in a boolean type of a variable i'll print it and let's run this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you will see it's true so this is a multi select box and now let's select elements so now we will select the value so i'll write first we will use select by index so i'll write select element dot select by index and i want to select this the first index itself so this the index starts with zero so this is the zeroth index that is the california so i'll write zero over here next we will use the select by value method i'll write select element dot select by value your value for new york is new york so i'll just copy this and i will paste it over here now next is that select by visible text so i'll write select element dot select by visible text and i will write the visible text that is present over here for washington it is washington so i'll just copy this washington and let's see whether it's selecting or not so i'll just run this command so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see there are three values that is selected that is the california new york and washington okay now if i want to know which is the first selected value so i'll write select element dot get first selected option dot get text i will write this in s out i want to print this so i'll write system.out.println select element.getfirst selected option dot get text now the first get first selected option returns the first selected option in the select tag here you can see it is the first selected option in the select text and if we don't find it it will throw the exception no such element exception if the option is not selected so let's execute this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated so the options are selected the first option that we have selected is california over here you can see the index that we have given zero so the first option that is selected over here is california okay now let's deselect the values for that we'll be using three commas at the deselect by index deselect by value and deselect by visible text so first i'll write select element dot deselect by index okay now i want to deselect new york because i have selected new york so i will be writing 0 1 2 new york is the third index so i'll write three now here i'll write thread dot sleep let me give some time and let's execute this micro browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and the values are selected california new york and washington and we saw the new york got deselected now next we will use the next method that is deselect by value so i'll write select element dot deselect by value now i want to deselect washington so the value of washington is washington so i'll simply copy this and paste it over here okay now let's execute this my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the three values that is selected and the new york and washington is deselected okay now we will use deselect by visible text so i'll write select element dot deselect by visible text and here i'll specify i will now here i want to deselect the california so the visible text that is present over here is california so i'll copy this paste it over here and let's run this the chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and those three values are selected the new york and washington is deselected okay so here i've used so here i'll write select element dot deselect by visible text and url paste california okay now so run this launch the chrome browser and maximize the web page and these are the three elements that is selected california new york and washington and all are deselected now over here the deselect option works only with the multi select boxes it does not work with the normal drop down box that we have it works only for the multi select for example if i work for the multi select box the deselect option then in that case for example over here i am selecting monday so in this case what will happen if i write select element dot deselect by visible text and here i'll specify monday itself so it will show an error so my chrome browser is launched it's navigated it's maximized and here you can see the date selected is monday but it shows an exception over here while deselecting monday shows an exception it says that you may only deselect options of a multi select okay so the deselect option works only for the multi select drop down menus and not for the drop down menus with the select class okay so these are the different types of methods that we learnt today that is the select by value select by index select by visible text and deselect by value deselect by index and deselect by visible text also we learned uh the option that is the get for selected options now this works for validation then we have learned the method that is the guest get first selected option also so these are the different types of methods that is supported by the select class so this is all for now in the next class we will learn how to inspect the bootstrap drop down menu so please like share and subscribe this video and thank you you
