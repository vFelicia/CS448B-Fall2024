00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:05 - in the last video we have seen what are
00:08 - Pointers in C and how we can use
00:10 - pointers in C and I have given you a
00:13 - simple example how to declare a pointer
00:16 - and how to assign values to the pointer
00:20 - and what is a
00:21 - pointer a pointer is a variable whose
00:24 - value is the address of another variable
00:27 - which we have seen in this line so this
00:30 - end symbol if you uh add before any
00:34 - variable it shows the address of the
00:37 - variable and this address we can assign
00:40 - to a pointer variable like this now in
00:43 - this video we are going to see how we
00:45 - can use arrays with pointer so let me
00:49 - give you an example for example we have
00:53 - uh array called
00:57 - value array which contains contains for
01:00 - example three values so we can Define
01:04 - array of size three like this and we can
01:09 - initialize array with these three values
01:11 - for example first value is 30 second
01:14 - value is
01:15 - 40 and third value is 50
01:19 - right and now we can assign this array
01:24 - to a
01:25 - pointer in the same manner we have
01:28 - assigned a variable to a pointer
01:31 - variable right so for that we need to
01:35 - declare a pointer array so we will name
01:38 - it as
01:39 - pointer array and in the same manner as
01:43 - array we will give the size to the
01:46 - pointer now to assign the values from
01:49 - array to a point array we just need to
01:53 - use for Loop to iterate over our array
01:57 - so we will write for
02:00 - int I is equal
02:03 - to0 I should be less than 3 because our
02:09 - array is of size three then I
02:13 - ++ and
02:15 - then inside our for Loop we can assign
02:19 - the values from array which is this
02:22 - array to the pointer array like this so
02:26 - we will just use the pointer array
02:29 - variable name and in the bracket we will
02:31 - provide index as I so it will
02:36 - increase as the value of I
02:39 - increases is equal
02:41 - to the address of
02:44 - the array Index right so this variable
02:48 - but the address one by one right so we
02:52 - will add this which indicates we are
02:55 - going to uh show the address or we are
02:58 - going to access the address of uh the
03:01 - variable which we write just after this
03:04 - end symbol so we are going to write
03:07 - access the address of value array at
03:12 - index I okay and hopefully in arrays
03:18 - when I have shown you how to use arrays
03:20 - using for Loop and how to access the
03:23 - values of array using for Loop you know
03:26 - uh this concept of iterating the value
03:29 - of array using for Loop so I'm not going
03:33 - to repeat this uh basically this for
03:36 - Loop we are going to use to iterate over
03:40 - this array one by one so I if I have the
03:44 - index zero we are accessing this 30
03:48 - value if the index is one we are going
03:50 - to access this if the index is two we
03:53 - going to access this value right so
03:56 - basically what we have done we have
03:59 - assigned find the
04:02 - addresses to our pointer array right so
04:07 - index of pointer is equal to you know
04:11 - whatever uh value is at this
04:15 - index the address of this right so what
04:19 - we have done
04:23 - here assign
04:28 - the address
04:31 - of
04:34 - array array
04:37 - elements okay now once we have assigned
04:42 - all these values to the pointer Now
04:44 - using this pointer you can access all
04:49 - these values how we are going to use
04:53 - once again a for
04:55 - Loop and in this for Loop we are going
04:58 - to use or access our value using this
05:02 - pointer okay so what we are going to do
05:07 - here we are going to access our array
05:11 - like this so we will print it print F
05:16 - and then we can
05:18 - write
05:21 - uh variable array I for example or
05:26 - value value of variable array or well
05:32 - array at index
05:38 - I and then is equal
05:43 - to the value so what will be the value
05:48 - so what we can write here
05:52 - is basically instead of this I we can
05:55 - just use percentage D so write
05:58 - percentage D is equal to and then
06:02 - percentage D which will give you the
06:05 - value right and then after comma or
06:09 - let's give a line break to it also and
06:13 - then after Comma just write I after
06:16 - Comma just write the
06:20 - pointer now pointer this stores the
06:24 - address right and then whenever you
06:28 - write this something like this because
06:31 - we are in for Loop this contains the
06:35 - address of the index which is contained
06:40 - by I so basically this value is a
06:45 - address of a variable but if we want to
06:50 - access the value of uh this address or
06:54 - value which is contained at this address
06:57 - we just need to use this D reference
07:00 - sing pointer once again like this okay
07:05 - and
07:06 - semicolon and now once we run the
07:09 - program let's see what happens build the
07:12 - program and we can access the value
07:16 - value of Val array is 0 is equal to 30
07:19 - which is true 30 40 50 value of well
07:23 - array 1 is equal to 40 value of well
07:27 - array at index 2 is equal to 50 so
07:31 - basically you can assign your
07:35 - array to a pointer array like this and
07:39 - then access your array using a pointer
07:44 - array like this okay so in this way you
07:49 - can uh use array pointers in C I hope
07:55 - you have enjoyed this video please wait

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners in the last video we have seen what are Pointers in C and how we can use pointers in C and I have given you a simple example how to declare a pointer and how to assign values to the pointer and what is a pointer a pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable which we have seen in this line so this end symbol if you uh add before any variable it shows the address of the variable and this address we can assign to a pointer variable like this now in this video we are going to see how we can use arrays with pointer so let me give you an example for example we have uh array called value array which contains contains for example three values so we can Define array of size three like this and we can initialize array with these three values for example first value is 30 second value is 40 and third value is 50 right and now we can assign this array to a pointer in the same manner we have assigned a variable to a pointer variable right so for that we need to declare a pointer array so we will name it as pointer array and in the same manner as array we will give the size to the pointer now to assign the values from array to a point array we just need to use for Loop to iterate over our array so we will write for int I is equal to0 I should be less than 3 because our array is of size three then I ++ and then inside our for Loop we can assign the values from array which is this array to the pointer array like this so we will just use the pointer array variable name and in the bracket we will provide index as I so it will increase as the value of I increases is equal to the address of the array Index right so this variable but the address one by one right so we will add this which indicates we are going to uh show the address or we are going to access the address of uh the variable which we write just after this end symbol so we are going to write access the address of value array at index I okay and hopefully in arrays when I have shown you how to use arrays using for Loop and how to access the values of array using for Loop you know uh this concept of iterating the value of array using for Loop so I'm not going to repeat this uh basically this for Loop we are going to use to iterate over this array one by one so I if I have the index zero we are accessing this 30 value if the index is one we are going to access this if the index is two we going to access this value right so basically what we have done we have assigned find the addresses to our pointer array right so index of pointer is equal to you know whatever uh value is at this index the address of this right so what we have done here assign the address of array array elements okay now once we have assigned all these values to the pointer Now using this pointer you can access all these values how we are going to use once again a for Loop and in this for Loop we are going to use or access our value using this pointer okay so what we are going to do here we are going to access our array like this so we will print it print F and then we can write uh variable array I for example or value value of variable array or well array at index I and then is equal to the value so what will be the value so what we can write here is basically instead of this I we can just use percentage D so write percentage D is equal to and then percentage D which will give you the value right and then after comma or let's give a line break to it also and then after Comma just write I after Comma just write the pointer now pointer this stores the address right and then whenever you write this something like this because we are in for Loop this contains the address of the index which is contained by I so basically this value is a address of a variable but if we want to access the value of uh this address or value which is contained at this address we just need to use this D reference sing pointer once again like this okay and semicolon and now once we run the program let's see what happens build the program and we can access the value value of Val array is 0 is equal to 30 which is true 30 40 50 value of well array 1 is equal to 40 value of well array at index 2 is equal to 50 so basically you can assign your array to a pointer array like this and then access your array using a pointer array like this okay so in this way you can uh use array pointers in C I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
