00:04 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:06 - you how you can install anaconda which
00:09 - is a Python distribution on your Windows
00:11 - 10 operating system so first of all what
00:14 - is anaconda
00:15 - so anaconda is a free and open source
00:18 - distribution of Python and our
00:21 - programming language for data science
00:23 - and machine learning related
00:25 - applications now anaconda comes with
00:28 - very nice tool such as spider and
00:31 - Jupiter notebook which are also used by
00:35 - the beginners to learn Python using
00:38 - these tools because they are really easy
00:41 - and convenient to use so let's see how
00:44 - we can download and install anaconda on
00:46 - our Windows 10 operating system so first
00:49 - of all you need to search for anaconda
00:52 - comm on your favorite browser and the
00:55 - first link which will appear here will
00:57 - be obviously from the anaconda dot-com
00:59 - website so we are going to go into this
01:02 - website and once this website is open on
01:06 - the left hand side you will be able to
01:09 - see this Downloads button which is a
01:11 - green button here so I'm going to click
01:13 - on this downloads button and once this
01:16 - downloads section opens you can see you
01:19 - can download anaconda for Windows Mac OS
01:23 - and Linux so by default windows is
01:27 - selected for us and you can see anaconda
01:30 - 5.2 is the latest version which is
01:33 - available at the time of making this
01:34 - video also you will be able to see that
01:38 - you can download anaconda with two
01:40 - versions of Python one is Python 2.7
01:43 - version and other is Python 3.6 foregin
01:47 - so the one we are going to download is
01:50 - this one which comes with python 3.6
01:54 - version and i'm going to click on this
01:56 - download button and then the download
01:58 - will start so this is about 331 megabyte
02:04 - file so I will first of all download it
02:06 - and save it to my Windows operating
02:09 - system so now this anaconda executable
02:12 - file is downloaded on my Windows
02:14 - operating system so I'm going to just
02:16 - double click on
02:17 - this executable file and I'm going to
02:20 - minimize a browser
02:21 - and my folder Explorer also so now the
02:24 - installation of anaconda is started I
02:27 - just need to click Next on this window
02:29 - and here I just need to agree with these
02:32 - license terms and conditions and I just
02:35 - need to click I agree here and now you
02:37 - will see this kind of window which will
02:38 - ask you if you want to install anaconda
02:41 - just for you or for all the users using
02:44 - this PC so I'm going to choose the next
02:47 - option which says all users and click
02:49 - Next and this is the default location
02:51 - where anaconda will be installed on your
02:54 - system so this will be installed by
02:56 - default in your C directory and in your
02:59 - C directory there will be a directory
03:01 - called a program data and inside the
03:04 - program data there will be a directory
03:06 - which will be created with the name
03:08 - anaconda 3 and you can see the space
03:11 - requirements here so it will take around
03:14 - a 3 GB space to install anaconda on your
03:19 - Windows 10 operating system so make sure
03:21 - you have this much amount of space on
03:23 - your Windows operating system and then
03:25 - I'm going to click Next and here you
03:27 - will see two options one is for setting
03:30 - the environment variables and other is
03:33 - to register anaconda as the system
03:35 - Python 3.6 so when I check this check
03:38 - box you will see that this text turns
03:41 - into red and it says not recommended
03:44 - instead open anaconda with Windows Start
03:47 - menu so what I will recommend here is if
03:50 - you have any version of Python installed
03:53 - on your windows operating system
03:56 - previously for example it can be either
03:59 - from python dodgy or from previous
04:02 - version of anaconda I will suggest to
04:05 - leave this unchecked if you are
04:08 - installing Python for the first time and
04:11 - anaconda for the first time then I will
04:13 - suggest you check this checkbox ok so on
04:17 - my system I don't have any previous
04:20 - version of anaconda or Python so I will
04:23 - check this checkbox and now I'm going to
04:26 - click install now this installation step
04:28 - is going to take good amount of time
04:31 - because it will take around 3 GB space
04:33 - on your PC so it will take some time so
04:36 - I will wait for the installation to
04:38 - complete so after some time I see this
04:40 - message which says installation complete
04:42 - so I'm going to click on Next button and
04:44 - on this next window it says anaconda has
04:47 - partnered with Microsoft to bring you
04:50 - Visual Studio code so if you want to
04:52 - install Visual Studio code on your
04:55 - Windows operating system then you can
04:57 - just click on this button which says
04:59 - install Visual Studio code otherwise you
05:01 - can skip this option so in my case I'm
05:04 - going to click on this skip button and
05:06 - I'm going to just uncheck these two
05:08 - check boxes and now I'm going to click
05:10 - on the finish button so now once
05:12 - anaconda is installed on your Windows
05:15 - operating system we can just search for
05:18 - anaconda here and it's going to give you
05:22 - few options
05:23 - first is anaconda Navigator and other is
05:27 - anaconda prompt so for now I'm going to
05:30 - just click on the anaconda prompt so
05:33 - first of all we are going to check the
05:34 - Python version on this anaconda prompt
05:37 - so I'm going to just write Python - -
05:40 - version here and then press enter and
05:42 - you can see it says python 3 point 6
05:46 - point 5 which is from anaconda Inc so
05:49 - this is the version of Python which is
05:51 - installed on my system also you can
05:54 - check which version of Conda which is
05:56 - installed on your system so you can give
05:58 - this command Conda info and then press
06:01 - Enter it's going to give you the version
06:04 - of Conda which is installed on your
06:07 - system with anaconda now if you don't
06:10 - know what is Conda Conda is an
06:13 - open-source cross-platform language
06:15 - agnostic package management system which
06:19 - is very useful to install some Python
06:21 - packages when you are developing in
06:24 - Python and now you can also see the
06:26 - version of Conda which is installed on
06:28 - your system
06:28 - this is Conda version 4 point 5 point 4
06:32 - on my system at the time of making this
06:34 - video so let's say if you want to
06:35 - install numpy you can just give this
06:38 - command Conda install and then numpy
06:42 - here and then press ENTER and numpy
06:44 - we'll be installed on your system let me
06:46 - make these phones a little bit bigger so
06:48 - you can see what am i typing so I'm
06:51 - going to just use the font xx here and
06:55 - now you can see this point is little bit
06:58 - bigger and you will be able to see what
07:00 - I am typing now as I said conda comes
07:02 - with some nice tools like jupiter
07:05 - notebook and spider so we will start
07:08 - using this command line so in order to
07:10 - open Jupiter you just need to type
07:13 - Jupiter notebook here and then press
07:15 - Enter which is going to start the
07:17 - Jupiter notebook so from here I can
07:19 - choose on which browser I want to open
07:22 - notebook let's say I want to open it on
07:24 - Firefox
07:26 - and now you can see Jupiter notebook is
07:29 - started on your firefox browser or
07:31 - whatever browser you have chosen now in
07:34 - order to create a new project
07:37 - in Python I can just go to the directory
07:41 - where I want to create this Python file
07:44 - and then I'm going to go on the top
07:47 - right hand side where it says new and
07:49 - first of all I'm going to create a
07:50 - folder and once this folder is created
07:53 - I'm going to check this folder and I'm
07:56 - going to rename this folder first of all
07:58 - so let me just rename it to the Python
08:02 - folder and once this folder is created
08:05 - I'm going to go inside this folder and
08:07 - now I'm going to once again click on new
08:09 - and this time I'm going to choose Python
08:12 - 3 here
08:14 - and once you do that you will see this
08:17 - kind of Jupiter interface will open so
08:20 - here you can type some Python command so
08:22 - for example I want to just add two
08:24 - numbers in order to evaluate this
08:27 - command you need to just press shift
08:29 - enter and this command will be evaluated
08:33 - okay so once again when I try to do some
08:37 - math here and when I press ENTER nothing
08:41 - happens it will just give you one extra
08:43 - line where you can type once again your
08:46 - code so once again I'm going to type my
08:49 - Python script and then once again I'm
08:52 - going to press shift enter and this time
08:55 - it will be evaluated okay so this enter
08:59 - command is used for example if you
09:01 - declare a variable X is equal to 6 and
09:04 - then if you want to multiply this X by
09:08 - some number for example let's say 6 and
09:12 - then when I press shift enter once again
09:14 - this will be evaluated so in order to
09:17 - evaluate a commanding you need to press
09:19 - shift and now if you want to save this
09:22 - notebook you can see right now it is
09:26 - untitled so you can give some title to
09:29 - this notebook for example and then I'm
09:32 - going to just save this file so we have
09:35 - successfully changed the name of this
09:37 - file and you can see unsaved changes so
09:41 - we are going to save our changes by
09:42 - clicking on file and then we will say
09:45 - save and checkpoint and now you can see
09:48 - auto saved so this file is now saved so
09:51 - now when I go to the location where I
09:52 - have saved this file I have saved this
09:55 - file in my desktop and then in the
09:57 - Python folder you will be able to see
09:59 - first python test with the extension IP
10:03 - Y and B so this is the Python Jupiter
10:05 - notebook extension which you can use
10:08 - anywhere else wherever you want so now
10:10 - let me minimize the browser and I'm
10:13 - going to once again search for anaconda
10:16 - here and once again open the anaconda
10:19 - prompt and now in order to start spider
10:22 - you need to type this command start
10:25 - spider and then I am going to press
10:27 - Enter
10:28 - and you will be able to see after some
10:30 - time this kind of icon will appear with
10:33 - say spider 3 and for the first time when
10:36 - you start spider it will ask you to
10:38 - provide some permissions so you can
10:40 - click allow access here so now you can
10:42 - see here our spider IDE has been started
10:45 - and now I will click on ok here and this
10:48 - is how your spider
10:49 - IDE looks like so here you can type some
10:52 - command for example 5 + 5 and then in
10:57 - order to execute it you can highlight
10:59 - this command and once again press shift
11:02 - enter and this command will be evaluated
11:05 - and the output is printed on this right
11:08 - hand side under the console also you can
11:10 - press this green button here and then
11:13 - press on run which will also execute
11:15 - your file in which you are working so
11:17 - you can see I'm working in my temp dot
11:20 - py file so when I just print something
11:23 - here so let me print 5 + 5 here once
11:27 - again and let me save the code and once
11:30 - again click on this green button you
11:32 - will see output is printed here when you
11:35 - run this temp dot py file so either if
11:38 - you want to execute a single line of
11:40 - code you can highlight this code or
11:43 - select this line of code and then press
11:46 - shift enter and this will be executed or
11:49 - otherwise if you want to execute the
11:51 - whole file whatever code you have
11:54 - written in this whole Python script then
11:57 - you can click on this green button so
11:59 - this is how you can open spider and
12:01 - Jupiter notebook using anaconda prompt
12:05 - let me close everything for now now let
12:08 - me show you one more thing and that is
12:10 - anaconda navigator so I'm going to just
12:12 - once again search for anaconda here and
12:14 - this time I will select anaconda
12:17 - navigator and this will open the
12:19 - anaconda navigator so now I'm going to
12:21 - just click on OK and don't show again so
12:24 - here you can see the list of all the
12:25 - tools which comes with anaconda so these
12:29 - four tools Jupiter lab Jupiter notebook
12:31 - QT console and spider comes
12:34 - pre-installed with anaconda and some
12:37 - tools you can install so for example
12:40 - globe is orange 3
12:42 - our studio and Visual Studio code you
12:45 - can install at any time by clicking on
12:47 - this install button whenever you want
12:51 - so from here also you can launch these
12:53 - tools or install the other tools which
12:56 - are right now not installed so this is
12:59 - how you can download install and use
13:02 - anaconda on your Windows 10 operating
13:04 - system
13:10 - so let's see how we can download and
13:12 - install anaconda on our Mac operating
13:14 - system so first of all you just need to
13:17 - go to this website which is
13:19 - www.hyken.com and you will be able to
13:22 - see this kind of interface and then you
13:25 - just need to click on the Downloads
13:27 - button and once this download page is
13:30 - open you will be able to see that this
13:32 - website will automatically detect
13:34 - whether this is Mac operating system or
13:36 - Windows or Linux operating system and
13:38 - because we are installing this on our
13:41 - Mac operating system so automatically
13:43 - this option will be selected which is
13:45 - Mac and then here you will see two
13:48 - options one is Python 3.7 version and
13:51 - other is Python 2.7 version so we are
13:55 - going to install this version which is
13:56 - the latest version so I'm going to just
13:59 - click on the Downloads button and then
14:01 - you will be able to see this download
14:03 - will start now at the time of making
14:05 - this video this file is about 634
14:09 - megabyte file so it will take some time
14:11 - to download so I will wait for the
14:14 - download to complete also if you want
14:16 - the cheat sheet for anaconda you can
14:18 - provide your email address here and get
14:20 - the cheat sheet using this email address
14:23 - so now you can see that this PKG file is
14:26 - downloaded so i'm going to click on this
14:28 - dot PKG file and then i'm going to
14:31 - minimize the browser and in few seconds
14:33 - you will see this kind of window and
14:35 - this says this package will run a
14:38 - program to determine if the software can
14:40 - be installed so i'm going to just click
14:43 - on continue button and then i'm going to
14:46 - just click on continue first of all and
14:48 - here you will get some information about
14:50 - anaconda so i'm going to click continue
14:52 - and then you need to agree with these
14:55 - license terms and conditions so i'm
14:57 - going to click on continue once again
14:59 - and then i'm going to click on agree and
15:02 - now you will see this window which will
15:03 - ask you to provide the destination so
15:05 - i'm going to just click on install for
15:08 - me only and then click continue and here
15:10 - you can see a 2.2 gb of space will be
15:13 - taken on my computer so I will just say
15:16 - install which is going to start the
15:18 - installation of anaconda on my Mac
15:21 - operating system so now I will wait for
15:23 - the
15:24 - halation to complete so now the
15:26 - installation of anaconda is complete on
15:28 - my Mac operating system and now you will
15:31 - see this window which will ask you if
15:33 - you want to download and install
15:36 - Microsoft Visual Studio code on your Mac
15:38 - operating system or not so I already
15:41 - have Visual Studio code on my Mac
15:42 - operating system so I will skip this
15:45 - step and I'm going to click on continue
15:47 - which is going to show me the summary
15:50 - and then I'm going to click on the close
15:53 - which is going to close this window and
15:56 - move this Installer to the Thresh so I'm
16:00 - going to just click on move to Thresh
16:01 - and now once anaconda distribution is
16:04 - installed on our Mac operating system we
16:06 - can just click on launch pad icon and
16:09 - then you will be able to see the
16:12 - Anaconda navigator I can here so I'm
16:14 - going to click on the Anaconda navigator
16:17 - icon this is going to start the Anaconda
16:20 - navigator and using this Anaconda
16:23 - navigator we will be able to launch
16:26 - Jupiter notebook or spider IDE so now
16:29 - you can see anaconda Navigator is
16:31 - launched and I'm going to first of all
16:34 - click on OK here and you will be able to
16:37 - see these icons so here you can find
16:40 - some tools which comes pre-installed
16:42 - with your anaconda distribution and
16:44 - these tools are Jupiter lab notebook QT
16:49 - console Spyder Lewis or Orange 3 tool
16:54 - now there are some tools which you can
16:56 - also install which is our studio or a
16:59 - Visual Studio code so you will be able
17:02 - to see in this install button under the
17:05 - tool which you want to install or if
17:08 - it's already installed you will be able
17:10 - to see this kind of launch button so
17:13 - let's first launch the Jupiter notebook
17:16 - using this anaconda navigator so I'm
17:18 - going to click on the launch button
17:20 - which is going to open the command
17:22 - prompt first of all and after some time
17:24 - it's going to launch the Jupiter
17:27 - notebook on your default browser so now
17:31 - I can see this Jupiter notebook is
17:33 - launched on the Safari browser which is
17:37 - my default
17:38 - Roza and let's say i want to go to the
17:40 - desktop first of all and here let's say
17:42 - i want to create a new folder so i'm
17:44 - going to click on new here and then i'm
17:47 - going to just click on folder and this
17:50 - folder is first of all untitled folder
17:53 - so I'm going to just click on untitled
17:55 - folder and once I'm in this untitled
17:59 - folder what I'm going to do is I'm going
18:01 - to select Python 3 here which is going
18:04 - to open the new notebook on the next tab
18:08 - which is going to launch the Jupiter
18:11 - notebook on the next tab so now from
18:14 - here I can change or give the name to my
18:16 - notebook so let's say I want to just say
18:19 - this is my first notebook so I'm going
18:22 - to just say first and then click on
18:25 - rename which is going to rename this
18:27 - notebook now in here I can give some
18:30 - commands so for example I want to just
18:32 - test whether it's working or not so I'm
18:35 - going to just write 2 plus 2 and then
18:37 - press ENTER you can see by pressing
18:39 - enter it's not going to give you the
18:41 - result but when you press shift enter
18:44 - it's going to print the output and give
18:48 - you the next cell so this is how it
18:50 - works so whenever you want to execute
18:53 - some command or statement you just need
18:56 - to write that command so for example I'm
18:59 - going to just write a equals 3 and then
19:03 - press ENTER and let's say I want to
19:05 - print the value of a so I'm going to
19:07 - just write print a and then press shift
19:11 - enter which is going to print the value
19:14 - of a which is 3 so this is how you can
19:18 - open and use Jupiter notebook now let's
19:21 - see how we can launch the spider IDE so
19:25 - I'm going to go to the Anaconda
19:27 - navigator once again and then I'm going
19:29 - to go to the spider icon and then click
19:33 - on the launch button which is going to
19:35 - launch the spider IDE so now you can see
19:38 - spider IDE has been started and here
19:41 - also we are going to just try to do
19:44 - something with Python statements so I'm
19:47 - going to just write 2+2 and in order to
19:50 - execute this
19:51 - you just need to select select this line
19:53 - and then press shift enter which is
19:55 - going to execute this statement on the
19:58 - console which you can see on the right
20:00 - hand bottom side here also if you want
20:04 - to execute a command you can directly
20:06 - execute it on the console here so you
20:09 - can just write 2+2 and it's going to
20:11 - show you the result in order to import
20:13 - some package for example I want to just
20:17 - import numpy so I'm going to just write
20:19 - import numpy as NP and then press ENTER
20:24 - it's just going to import the numpy
20:27 - module into the console so now you can
20:31 - use this number to just test whatever
20:35 - you want to do so let me just close this
20:38 - spider IDE and I want to show you one
20:42 - more thing so if you open the terminal
20:44 - after installing the anaconda you can
20:46 - also check for the Conda command if it's
20:50 - working or not so first of all what is
20:52 - Conda so Conda is an open source
20:55 - cross-platform language agnostic package
20:59 - management system which we can use with
21:02 - the anaconda distribution so in order to
21:05 - check whether Conda is working fine you
21:08 - can just right Conda info and then press
21:11 - Enter it's going to show you the
21:13 - information about the Kahn diversion so
21:16 - you can see Conda version which is
21:18 - installed right now
21:19 - is four point five point 11 at the time
21:21 - of making this video now if you want to
21:24 - launch the Jupiter notebook or spider
21:28 - from the terminal you can also do that
21:31 - so let me open a new terminal by
21:33 - right-clicking on the terminal icon and
21:35 - then press on new window and once this
21:39 - terminal is open in order to start
21:41 - spider I can just write spider and then
21:45 - press ENTER and this command is going to
21:48 - start the spider IDE let me open one
21:52 - more terminal and let me show you what
21:56 - is the command to open the Jupiter
21:58 - notebook so in order to open the Jupiter
22:01 - notebook you can just write Jupiter
22:03 - notebook but right now you can see
22:05 - the spider IDE is initializing right now
22:09 - so let's open the Jupiter notebook also
22:13 - by the command line so just right
22:15 - Jupiter notebook here and then press
22:18 - Enter
22:19 - which is going to start the Jupiter
22:21 - notebook in your default browser which
22:24 - is Safari in my case so you can see the
22:27 - spider ID is started using the command
22:31 - line and also the Jupiter notebook will
22:34 - start after some time in your default
22:37 - browser so you can see this spider IDE
22:40 - has been started and I will wait for the
22:43 - Jupiter notebook to start so now you can
22:46 - see Jupiter notebook is also started on
22:48 - a safari so in this way also you can
22:51 - open the Jupiter notebook and spider IDE
22:55 - using the Mac terminal so this is how
22:59 - you can download and install and use
23:02 - anaconda distribution on your Mac
23:05 - operating system
23:10 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
23:12 - you how you can download and install
23:14 - anaconda which is a Python distribution
23:17 - on your open 2 operating system so let's
23:20 - see how we can install anaconda so first
23:23 - of all open your favorite browser and
23:25 - search for anaconda comm and the first
23:28 - language will obviously appear here will
23:30 - be from anaconda comm so just go to this
23:35 - website which is anaconda comm and on
23:37 - the right hand top you will be able to
23:39 - see this button it says download in
23:41 - green so just click on this button and
23:44 - then just scroll down and you will be
23:47 - able to see the linux is already
23:49 - selected here and the latest version of
23:53 - anaconda at the time of making this
23:55 - video is anaconda 5.2 now you will also
23:59 - see here 2 version of python which is
24:02 - available with this anaconda
24:04 - installation one is Python 2.7 other is
24:08 - Python 3.6 so what we are going to do is
24:12 - we are going to install the 3.6 version
24:15 - of python so i'm going to just click on
24:17 - this download button which is going to
24:20 - start the download of this dot SH file
24:24 - so I'm going to just save it on my
24:26 - computer and I'm going to close this
24:29 - window so now this anaconda
24:32 - dot SH file is downloaded on my Ubuntu
24:35 - operating system so let's see how we can
24:37 - install anaconda using this dot SH file
24:41 - so on this download page where you have
24:43 - downloaded anaconda dot s H file when
24:47 - you scroll down you will be able to see
24:49 - these two links one is how to get python
24:52 - 3.5 and other python versions and other
24:55 - is how to install anaconda so we will
24:57 - click on this link which says how to
24:59 - install anaconda and let's see what is
25:02 - the official document saying so first of
25:07 - all we need to download this dot SH file
25:09 - so that we have already done second step
25:12 - is we need to just verify the checksum
25:16 - we are going to skip this step and in
25:19 - the third step we need to run the dot SH
25:22 - file using
25:23 - this command okay so I'm going to just
25:26 - copy this command from here and then I'm
25:29 - going to open the terminal you can open
25:31 - the terminal either by pressing ctrl alt
25:34 - T or by going to this show applications
25:40 - icon and then here searching for
25:43 - terminal and then open the terminal from
25:46 - here okay
25:47 - so once the terminal is open I'm going
25:50 - to just minimize the browser first of
25:52 - all and once the terminal is open I can
25:55 - either give this command which is bash
25:58 - and then because our dot sh file is
26:02 - downloaded inside this downloads folder
26:05 - so this command is enough to run the
26:07 - installer okay so I'm going to just
26:10 - press ENTER here and you can see the
26:14 - installation has been started and here
26:16 - we just need to press ENTER once again
26:18 - to continue so I'm going to press ENTER
26:20 - and first of all you need to read this
26:23 - license terms and conditions and if you
26:26 - agree with the license terms and
26:28 - conditions you need to type yes here and
26:31 - then press Enter now in the next step
26:33 - you will be asked to provide the default
26:36 - location where you want to install
26:39 - anaconda so the default location is this
26:42 - one if you want to change it or if you
26:45 - have the good reason to change this
26:47 - location you can change it but for now
26:49 - I'm going to leave it as default so I'm
26:52 - going to press Enter and then you will
26:54 - see the installation of the packages
26:57 - will start one by one it will start all
27:00 - the packages related to anaconda so I
27:03 - will wait for the installation to
27:04 - complete so now the installation of
27:06 - anaconda is almost completed and at last
27:10 - it'll ask you two questions first
27:13 - question is do you wish the Installer to
27:15 - prepend the anaconda install location to
27:19 - the path and here you must ideally type
27:22 - yes
27:23 - by mistake I have pressed extra Enter
27:25 - key here so this step in my case is
27:29 - skipped but if you see this question you
27:33 - may want to type yes here which will
27:35 - append
27:36 - this export to your bash RC and now
27:40 - because I haven't typed yes here I need
27:44 - to add this part manually to the bash RC
27:48 - file now the second question is do you
27:50 - wish to install Microsoft Visual Studio
27:53 - code so if you want to install Microsoft
27:55 - Visual Studio code you can type yes
27:58 - otherwise you can type no here so in my
28:01 - case I don't want to install Microsoft
28:02 - Visual Studio code so I type no here and
28:06 - then I come out of this terminal but
28:09 - still because I haven't typed yes here
28:11 - so I need to open this dot bash RC file
28:15 - so I'm going to just copy this path and
28:18 - then using G added so I'm going to just
28:21 - try G add it here and then the path
28:24 - which I have copied and then press enter
28:26 - here which is going to open my dot bash
28:29 - RC file and at the end of the bash RC
28:32 - file I just want to add this line of
28:36 - export so I will just copy this export
28:39 - from here and then at the end of this
28:42 - file I will just add this export at the
28:46 - end so just add this export to the end
28:49 - of Bashar C if you haven't typed yes to
28:52 - this question and then just save your
28:55 - bash RC file and then close it and let's
28:57 - go to the website and let's see what it
28:59 - says at the end so we have done every
29:02 - step here and at the end it says we need
29:05 - to run source bash RC file in order to
29:08 - reload this dot bash RC file into the
29:11 - terminals so I'm going to just write
29:13 - source and then the path of the bash RC
29:16 - you can also write dot bash RC from here
29:20 - also because bash RC is present in to
29:23 - the home directory right so we can
29:25 - directly write bash RC here or we can
29:28 - give the whole path of bash RC which is
29:31 - this one and then I'm going to press
29:33 - ENTER which is going to reload this bash
29:36 - RC file into the terminal so now
29:38 - anaconda is installed on our open to
29:41 - operating system and let's see the last
29:43 - command which we can run so the last
29:47 - command here which we can run is this an
29:49 - accord
29:50 - navigator command and this command is
29:53 - going to launch the Anaconda navigator
29:56 - so let's run this command let me clear
29:58 - the terminal first of all and let's run
30:01 - this command which is anaconda -
30:03 - navigator and then press Enter and after
30:06 - few seconds you will be able to see this
30:08 - Anaconda navigator here ok so you can
30:11 - click on ok and don't show this message
30:14 - again here and you can see anaconda
30:17 - comes with these pre-installed tools so
30:21 - for example Jupiter lab is pre-installed
30:23 - to be the notebook is pre-installed QT
30:26 - console is pre-installed and also Spyder
30:30 - IDE is pre-installed in addition you can
30:33 - install some of the packages from this
30:36 - anaconda Navigator and these packages
30:39 - are blue with orange 3 and you can also
30:43 - install a studio and Visual Studio code
30:46 - using this anaconda navigator
30:48 - so to launch for example Jupiter
30:51 - notebook you can just click on this
30:53 - launch button and Jupiter notebook will
30:56 - be launched ok but I want to show you
30:58 - how to launch Jupiter notebook using the
31:01 - command line so for now I'm going to
31:03 - just close this anaconda navigator and
31:06 - then I'm going to just say yes this is
31:09 - going to close the anaconda navigator so
31:12 - first of all we will check whether Conda
31:14 - command is working fine on our open to
31:17 - operating system or not after installing
31:19 - anaconda so just right Conda info here
31:23 - and then press ENTER and you will be
31:27 - able to see this output and here you
31:30 - will be able to see the version of Conda
31:32 - which is installed on our system also
31:34 - you can run the Condor list command so
31:38 - just right Conda list and then press
31:40 - Enter which is going to print the list
31:43 - of all the packages which are already
31:46 - there on your open to operating system
31:49 - now let me clear the terminal once again
31:52 - and now in order to open Jupiter
31:55 - notebook you need to type Jupiter
31:57 - notebook here and then press ENTER which
32:01 - is going to start the Jupiter
32:03 - notebook on the default browser so you
32:07 - can see Jupiter notebook has been
32:09 - started on my default browser now in
32:12 - order to create a Jupiter project I can
32:15 - go to the location where I want to save
32:17 - my project so let's say I want to save
32:19 - my project in the documents directory
32:21 - and then on the top right-hand side I
32:25 - can create a folder here so let me
32:27 - create a folder so when you click on
32:30 - create folder and name the folder will
32:33 - be created and then you can check this
32:35 - checkbox and then rename this folder to
32:38 - whatever folder you want so for example
32:41 - I'm going to name this folder as Python
32:43 - and then click new rename and this
32:47 - folder will be created so inside this
32:49 - feyten folder so when I am inside this
32:51 - Python folder I can just click on new
32:55 - once again and then click on Python 3
32:58 - and this will open this new window and
33:01 - in this new window you can run Python
33:04 - command so for example I'm going to just
33:06 - give some Python expression here 5 plus
33:09 - 5 and to execute this command you need
33:12 - to press shift enter which will execute
33:15 - this command ok once again I'm going to
33:19 - declare a variable let's say X is equal
33:21 - to 6 and when I press ENTER without the
33:24 - shift it's going to give me the next
33:26 - line and here I can write some more
33:30 - expression and when I press shift enter
33:33 - it's going to execute that command ok so
33:37 - this is how you can execute commands on
33:41 - Jupiter notebook now I can also save
33:44 - this file so you can see this is now
33:46 - right now untitled so I can just click
33:48 - on this untitled text here and I can
33:51 - give some name here so I'm going to just
33:54 - give first underscore notebook and then
33:59 - I'm going to click on rename which is
34:01 - going to rename this file but still you
34:03 - can see unsaved changes so to save these
34:06 - changes you need to click on file and
34:08 - then click on save and checkpoint and
34:12 - once again when I open the terminal so
34:15 - I'm going to open the new term
34:17 - and on the terminal I will go to the
34:19 - location where I have created this file
34:21 - so CD documents and then Python and here
34:26 - when I do LS you will see this file is
34:30 - created which is first notebook which is
34:32 - the name of my file you can see here
34:34 - with the extension IP Y and B okay so
34:38 - you this is how you can run the Jupiter
34:40 - notebook using the terminal you can also
34:43 - launch this Jupiter notebook using
34:46 - anaconda navigator also now let me close
34:49 - this browser and let me also close this
34:53 - notebook Jupiter server so in order to
34:56 - close this Jupiter notebook server you
34:58 - just need to press ctrl C here and then
35:00 - press Y and then press ENTER and you
35:04 - will come out of this server so I'm
35:07 - going to close this terminal once again
35:09 - and on the next terminal this time I
35:12 - want to start the spider IDE using this
35:17 - terminal so just write spider and then
35:20 - press ENTER and if you see this message
35:22 - which says segmentation fault or any
35:24 - other error you can first of all update
35:27 - the spider version using the Conda
35:30 - command so just write Conda update
35:33 - spider and then press ENTER which is
35:36 - going to update the version of spider on
35:39 - your bun to operating system and once
35:41 - you have updated the version of spider
35:44 - using Conda you can also run this
35:46 - command which is Conda install and then
35:49 - PI OpenGL ok and then press ENTER once
35:53 - again and now you just need to press Y
35:55 - to proceed and once this command is
35:57 - successful we are going to run this
35:59 - spider command once again in order to
36:02 - launch the spider and you can see the
36:05 - spider is now open so first of all I'm
36:08 - going to click on OK here and in order
36:11 - to run some command or run this Python
36:13 - script I can for example write something
36:17 - here so I just want to write 5 plus 5
36:19 - and then I can select this line which I
36:22 - have written which is 5 plus 5 and then
36:25 - press shift enter in order to execute
36:28 - this command and you will see here the
36:31 - put of this expression is printed here
36:33 - if you want to execute the whole file
36:35 - for example I will just write here prin
36:38 - and inside the parenthesis I will just
36:40 - print HelloWorld and I will save my file
36:43 - and I can also press this green button
36:45 - which is used to run your Python file
36:48 - and you can see hello world is again
36:52 - printed once again I will just correct
36:54 - the spelling of hello here and then once
36:56 - again I'm going to run this program and
36:58 - you can see this script has been
37:01 - executed by this spider IDE and the
37:05 - output you will be able to see on the
37:07 - console here so this is how you can
37:10 - download and install anaconda with
37:12 - Jupiter notebook and spider IDE I hope
37:16 - you have enjoyed this video and I will
37:17 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your Windows 10 operating system so first of all what is anaconda so anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python and our programming language for data science and machine learning related applications now anaconda comes with very nice tool such as spider and Jupiter notebook which are also used by the beginners to learn Python using these tools because they are really easy and convenient to use so let's see how we can download and install anaconda on our Windows 10 operating system so first of all you need to search for anaconda comm on your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be obviously from the anaconda dotcom website so we are going to go into this website and once this website is open on the left hand side you will be able to see this Downloads button which is a green button here so I'm going to click on this downloads button and once this downloads section opens you can see you can download anaconda for Windows Mac OS and Linux so by default windows is selected for us and you can see anaconda 5.2 is the latest version which is available at the time of making this video also you will be able to see that you can download anaconda with two versions of Python one is Python 2.7 version and other is Python 3.6 foregin so the one we are going to download is this one which comes with python 3.6 version and i'm going to click on this download button and then the download will start so this is about 331 megabyte file so I will first of all download it and save it to my Windows operating system so now this anaconda executable file is downloaded on my Windows operating system so I'm going to just double click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize a browser and my folder Explorer also so now the installation of anaconda is started I just need to click Next on this window and here I just need to agree with these license terms and conditions and I just need to click I agree here and now you will see this kind of window which will ask you if you want to install anaconda just for you or for all the users using this PC so I'm going to choose the next option which says all users and click Next and this is the default location where anaconda will be installed on your system so this will be installed by default in your C directory and in your C directory there will be a directory called a program data and inside the program data there will be a directory which will be created with the name anaconda 3 and you can see the space requirements here so it will take around a 3 GB space to install anaconda on your Windows 10 operating system so make sure you have this much amount of space on your Windows operating system and then I'm going to click Next and here you will see two options one is for setting the environment variables and other is to register anaconda as the system Python 3.6 so when I check this check box you will see that this text turns into red and it says not recommended instead open anaconda with Windows Start menu so what I will recommend here is if you have any version of Python installed on your windows operating system previously for example it can be either from python dodgy or from previous version of anaconda I will suggest to leave this unchecked if you are installing Python for the first time and anaconda for the first time then I will suggest you check this checkbox ok so on my system I don't have any previous version of anaconda or Python so I will check this checkbox and now I'm going to click install now this installation step is going to take good amount of time because it will take around 3 GB space on your PC so it will take some time so I will wait for the installation to complete so after some time I see this message which says installation complete so I'm going to click on Next button and on this next window it says anaconda has partnered with Microsoft to bring you Visual Studio code so if you want to install Visual Studio code on your Windows operating system then you can just click on this button which says install Visual Studio code otherwise you can skip this option so in my case I'm going to click on this skip button and I'm going to just uncheck these two check boxes and now I'm going to click on the finish button so now once anaconda is installed on your Windows operating system we can just search for anaconda here and it's going to give you few options first is anaconda Navigator and other is anaconda prompt so for now I'm going to just click on the anaconda prompt so first of all we are going to check the Python version on this anaconda prompt so I'm going to just write Python version here and then press enter and you can see it says python 3 point 6 point 5 which is from anaconda Inc so this is the version of Python which is installed on my system also you can check which version of Conda which is installed on your system so you can give this command Conda info and then press Enter it's going to give you the version of Conda which is installed on your system with anaconda now if you don't know what is Conda Conda is an opensource crossplatform language agnostic package management system which is very useful to install some Python packages when you are developing in Python and now you can also see the version of Conda which is installed on your system this is Conda version 4 point 5 point 4 on my system at the time of making this video so let's say if you want to install numpy you can just give this command Conda install and then numpy here and then press ENTER and numpy we'll be installed on your system let me make these phones a little bit bigger so you can see what am i typing so I'm going to just use the font xx here and now you can see this point is little bit bigger and you will be able to see what I am typing now as I said conda comes with some nice tools like jupiter notebook and spider so we will start using this command line so in order to open Jupiter you just need to type Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook so from here I can choose on which browser I want to open notebook let's say I want to open it on Firefox and now you can see Jupiter notebook is started on your firefox browser or whatever browser you have chosen now in order to create a new project in Python I can just go to the directory where I want to create this Python file and then I'm going to go on the top right hand side where it says new and first of all I'm going to create a folder and once this folder is created I'm going to check this folder and I'm going to rename this folder first of all so let me just rename it to the Python folder and once this folder is created I'm going to go inside this folder and now I'm going to once again click on new and this time I'm going to choose Python 3 here and once you do that you will see this kind of Jupiter interface will open so here you can type some Python command so for example I want to just add two numbers in order to evaluate this command you need to just press shift enter and this command will be evaluated okay so once again when I try to do some math here and when I press ENTER nothing happens it will just give you one extra line where you can type once again your code so once again I'm going to type my Python script and then once again I'm going to press shift enter and this time it will be evaluated okay so this enter command is used for example if you declare a variable X is equal to 6 and then if you want to multiply this X by some number for example let's say 6 and then when I press shift enter once again this will be evaluated so in order to evaluate a commanding you need to press shift and now if you want to save this notebook you can see right now it is untitled so you can give some title to this notebook for example and then I'm going to just save this file so we have successfully changed the name of this file and you can see unsaved changes so we are going to save our changes by clicking on file and then we will say save and checkpoint and now you can see auto saved so this file is now saved so now when I go to the location where I have saved this file I have saved this file in my desktop and then in the Python folder you will be able to see first python test with the extension IP Y and B so this is the Python Jupiter notebook extension which you can use anywhere else wherever you want so now let me minimize the browser and I'm going to once again search for anaconda here and once again open the anaconda prompt and now in order to start spider you need to type this command start spider and then I am going to press Enter and you will be able to see after some time this kind of icon will appear with say spider 3 and for the first time when you start spider it will ask you to provide some permissions so you can click allow access here so now you can see here our spider IDE has been started and now I will click on ok here and this is how your spider IDE looks like so here you can type some command for example 5 + 5 and then in order to execute it you can highlight this command and once again press shift enter and this command will be evaluated and the output is printed on this right hand side under the console also you can press this green button here and then press on run which will also execute your file in which you are working so you can see I'm working in my temp dot py file so when I just print something here so let me print 5 + 5 here once again and let me save the code and once again click on this green button you will see output is printed here when you run this temp dot py file so either if you want to execute a single line of code you can highlight this code or select this line of code and then press shift enter and this will be executed or otherwise if you want to execute the whole file whatever code you have written in this whole Python script then you can click on this green button so this is how you can open spider and Jupiter notebook using anaconda prompt let me close everything for now now let me show you one more thing and that is anaconda navigator so I'm going to just once again search for anaconda here and this time I will select anaconda navigator and this will open the anaconda navigator so now I'm going to just click on OK and don't show again so here you can see the list of all the tools which comes with anaconda so these four tools Jupiter lab Jupiter notebook QT console and spider comes preinstalled with anaconda and some tools you can install so for example globe is orange 3 our studio and Visual Studio code you can install at any time by clicking on this install button whenever you want so from here also you can launch these tools or install the other tools which are right now not installed so this is how you can download install and use anaconda on your Windows 10 operating system so let's see how we can download and install anaconda on our Mac operating system so first of all you just need to go to this website which is www.hyken.com and you will be able to see this kind of interface and then you just need to click on the Downloads button and once this download page is open you will be able to see that this website will automatically detect whether this is Mac operating system or Windows or Linux operating system and because we are installing this on our Mac operating system so automatically this option will be selected which is Mac and then here you will see two options one is Python 3.7 version and other is Python 2.7 version so we are going to install this version which is the latest version so I'm going to just click on the Downloads button and then you will be able to see this download will start now at the time of making this video this file is about 634 megabyte file so it will take some time to download so I will wait for the download to complete also if you want the cheat sheet for anaconda you can provide your email address here and get the cheat sheet using this email address so now you can see that this PKG file is downloaded so i'm going to click on this dot PKG file and then i'm going to minimize the browser and in few seconds you will see this kind of window and this says this package will run a program to determine if the software can be installed so i'm going to just click on continue button and then i'm going to just click on continue first of all and here you will get some information about anaconda so i'm going to click continue and then you need to agree with these license terms and conditions so i'm going to click on continue once again and then i'm going to click on agree and now you will see this window which will ask you to provide the destination so i'm going to just click on install for me only and then click continue and here you can see a 2.2 gb of space will be taken on my computer so I will just say install which is going to start the installation of anaconda on my Mac operating system so now I will wait for the halation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is complete on my Mac operating system and now you will see this window which will ask you if you want to download and install Microsoft Visual Studio code on your Mac operating system or not so I already have Visual Studio code on my Mac operating system so I will skip this step and I'm going to click on continue which is going to show me the summary and then I'm going to click on the close which is going to close this window and move this Installer to the Thresh so I'm going to just click on move to Thresh and now once anaconda distribution is installed on our Mac operating system we can just click on launch pad icon and then you will be able to see the Anaconda navigator I can here so I'm going to click on the Anaconda navigator icon this is going to start the Anaconda navigator and using this Anaconda navigator we will be able to launch Jupiter notebook or spider IDE so now you can see anaconda Navigator is launched and I'm going to first of all click on OK here and you will be able to see these icons so here you can find some tools which comes preinstalled with your anaconda distribution and these tools are Jupiter lab notebook QT console Spyder Lewis or Orange 3 tool now there are some tools which you can also install which is our studio or a Visual Studio code so you will be able to see in this install button under the tool which you want to install or if it's already installed you will be able to see this kind of launch button so let's first launch the Jupiter notebook using this anaconda navigator so I'm going to click on the launch button which is going to open the command prompt first of all and after some time it's going to launch the Jupiter notebook on your default browser so now I can see this Jupiter notebook is launched on the Safari browser which is my default Roza and let's say i want to go to the desktop first of all and here let's say i want to create a new folder so i'm going to click on new here and then i'm going to just click on folder and this folder is first of all untitled folder so I'm going to just click on untitled folder and once I'm in this untitled folder what I'm going to do is I'm going to select Python 3 here which is going to open the new notebook on the next tab which is going to launch the Jupiter notebook on the next tab so now from here I can change or give the name to my notebook so let's say I want to just say this is my first notebook so I'm going to just say first and then click on rename which is going to rename this notebook now in here I can give some commands so for example I want to just test whether it's working or not so I'm going to just write 2 plus 2 and then press ENTER you can see by pressing enter it's not going to give you the result but when you press shift enter it's going to print the output and give you the next cell so this is how it works so whenever you want to execute some command or statement you just need to write that command so for example I'm going to just write a equals 3 and then press ENTER and let's say I want to print the value of a so I'm going to just write print a and then press shift enter which is going to print the value of a which is 3 so this is how you can open and use Jupiter notebook now let's see how we can launch the spider IDE so I'm going to go to the Anaconda navigator once again and then I'm going to go to the spider icon and then click on the launch button which is going to launch the spider IDE so now you can see spider IDE has been started and here also we are going to just try to do something with Python statements so I'm going to just write 2+2 and in order to execute this you just need to select select this line and then press shift enter which is going to execute this statement on the console which you can see on the right hand bottom side here also if you want to execute a command you can directly execute it on the console here so you can just write 2+2 and it's going to show you the result in order to import some package for example I want to just import numpy so I'm going to just write import numpy as NP and then press ENTER it's just going to import the numpy module into the console so now you can use this number to just test whatever you want to do so let me just close this spider IDE and I want to show you one more thing so if you open the terminal after installing the anaconda you can also check for the Conda command if it's working or not so first of all what is Conda so Conda is an open source crossplatform language agnostic package management system which we can use with the anaconda distribution so in order to check whether Conda is working fine you can just right Conda info and then press Enter it's going to show you the information about the Kahn diversion so you can see Conda version which is installed right now is four point five point 11 at the time of making this video now if you want to launch the Jupiter notebook or spider from the terminal you can also do that so let me open a new terminal by rightclicking on the terminal icon and then press on new window and once this terminal is open in order to start spider I can just write spider and then press ENTER and this command is going to start the spider IDE let me open one more terminal and let me show you what is the command to open the Jupiter notebook so in order to open the Jupiter notebook you can just write Jupiter notebook but right now you can see the spider IDE is initializing right now so let's open the Jupiter notebook also by the command line so just right Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook in your default browser which is Safari in my case so you can see the spider ID is started using the command line and also the Jupiter notebook will start after some time in your default browser so you can see this spider IDE has been started and I will wait for the Jupiter notebook to start so now you can see Jupiter notebook is also started on a safari so in this way also you can open the Jupiter notebook and spider IDE using the Mac terminal so this is how you can download and install and use anaconda distribution on your Mac operating system hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your open 2 operating system so let's see how we can install anaconda so first of all open your favorite browser and search for anaconda comm and the first language will obviously appear here will be from anaconda comm so just go to this website which is anaconda comm and on the right hand top you will be able to see this button it says download in green so just click on this button and then just scroll down and you will be able to see the linux is already selected here and the latest version of anaconda at the time of making this video is anaconda 5.2 now you will also see here 2 version of python which is available with this anaconda installation one is Python 2.7 other is Python 3.6 so what we are going to do is we are going to install the 3.6 version of python so i'm going to just click on this download button which is going to start the download of this dot SH file so I'm going to just save it on my computer and I'm going to close this window so now this anaconda dot SH file is downloaded on my Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can install anaconda using this dot SH file so on this download page where you have downloaded anaconda dot s H file when you scroll down you will be able to see these two links one is how to get python 3.5 and other python versions and other is how to install anaconda so we will click on this link which says how to install anaconda and let's see what is the official document saying so first of all we need to download this dot SH file so that we have already done second step is we need to just verify the checksum we are going to skip this step and in the third step we need to run the dot SH file using this command okay so I'm going to just copy this command from here and then I'm going to open the terminal you can open the terminal either by pressing ctrl alt T or by going to this show applications icon and then here searching for terminal and then open the terminal from here okay so once the terminal is open I'm going to just minimize the browser first of all and once the terminal is open I can either give this command which is bash and then because our dot sh file is downloaded inside this downloads folder so this command is enough to run the installer okay so I'm going to just press ENTER here and you can see the installation has been started and here we just need to press ENTER once again to continue so I'm going to press ENTER and first of all you need to read this license terms and conditions and if you agree with the license terms and conditions you need to type yes here and then press Enter now in the next step you will be asked to provide the default location where you want to install anaconda so the default location is this one if you want to change it or if you have the good reason to change this location you can change it but for now I'm going to leave it as default so I'm going to press Enter and then you will see the installation of the packages will start one by one it will start all the packages related to anaconda so I will wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is almost completed and at last it'll ask you two questions first question is do you wish the Installer to prepend the anaconda install location to the path and here you must ideally type yes by mistake I have pressed extra Enter key here so this step in my case is skipped but if you see this question you may want to type yes here which will append this export to your bash RC and now because I haven't typed yes here I need to add this part manually to the bash RC file now the second question is do you wish to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so if you want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code you can type yes otherwise you can type no here so in my case I don't want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so I type no here and then I come out of this terminal but still because I haven't typed yes here so I need to open this dot bash RC file so I'm going to just copy this path and then using G added so I'm going to just try G add it here and then the path which I have copied and then press enter here which is going to open my dot bash RC file and at the end of the bash RC file I just want to add this line of export so I will just copy this export from here and then at the end of this file I will just add this export at the end so just add this export to the end of Bashar C if you haven't typed yes to this question and then just save your bash RC file and then close it and let's go to the website and let's see what it says at the end so we have done every step here and at the end it says we need to run source bash RC file in order to reload this dot bash RC file into the terminals so I'm going to just write source and then the path of the bash RC you can also write dot bash RC from here also because bash RC is present in to the home directory right so we can directly write bash RC here or we can give the whole path of bash RC which is this one and then I'm going to press ENTER which is going to reload this bash RC file into the terminal so now anaconda is installed on our open to operating system and let's see the last command which we can run so the last command here which we can run is this an accord navigator command and this command is going to launch the Anaconda navigator so let's run this command let me clear the terminal first of all and let's run this command which is anaconda navigator and then press Enter and after few seconds you will be able to see this Anaconda navigator here ok so you can click on ok and don't show this message again here and you can see anaconda comes with these preinstalled tools so for example Jupiter lab is preinstalled to be the notebook is preinstalled QT console is preinstalled and also Spyder IDE is preinstalled in addition you can install some of the packages from this anaconda Navigator and these packages are blue with orange 3 and you can also install a studio and Visual Studio code using this anaconda navigator so to launch for example Jupiter notebook you can just click on this launch button and Jupiter notebook will be launched ok but I want to show you how to launch Jupiter notebook using the command line so for now I'm going to just close this anaconda navigator and then I'm going to just say yes this is going to close the anaconda navigator so first of all we will check whether Conda command is working fine on our open to operating system or not after installing anaconda so just right Conda info here and then press ENTER and you will be able to see this output and here you will be able to see the version of Conda which is installed on our system also you can run the Condor list command so just right Conda list and then press Enter which is going to print the list of all the packages which are already there on your open to operating system now let me clear the terminal once again and now in order to open Jupiter notebook you need to type Jupiter notebook here and then press ENTER which is going to start the Jupiter notebook on the default browser so you can see Jupiter notebook has been started on my default browser now in order to create a Jupiter project I can go to the location where I want to save my project so let's say I want to save my project in the documents directory and then on the top righthand side I can create a folder here so let me create a folder so when you click on create folder and name the folder will be created and then you can check this checkbox and then rename this folder to whatever folder you want so for example I'm going to name this folder as Python and then click new rename and this folder will be created so inside this feyten folder so when I am inside this Python folder I can just click on new once again and then click on Python 3 and this will open this new window and in this new window you can run Python command so for example I'm going to just give some Python expression here 5 plus 5 and to execute this command you need to press shift enter which will execute this command ok once again I'm going to declare a variable let's say X is equal to 6 and when I press ENTER without the shift it's going to give me the next line and here I can write some more expression and when I press shift enter it's going to execute that command ok so this is how you can execute commands on Jupiter notebook now I can also save this file so you can see this is now right now untitled so I can just click on this untitled text here and I can give some name here so I'm going to just give first underscore notebook and then I'm going to click on rename which is going to rename this file but still you can see unsaved changes so to save these changes you need to click on file and then click on save and checkpoint and once again when I open the terminal so I'm going to open the new term and on the terminal I will go to the location where I have created this file so CD documents and then Python and here when I do LS you will see this file is created which is first notebook which is the name of my file you can see here with the extension IP Y and B okay so you this is how you can run the Jupiter notebook using the terminal you can also launch this Jupiter notebook using anaconda navigator also now let me close this browser and let me also close this notebook Jupiter server so in order to close this Jupiter notebook server you just need to press ctrl C here and then press Y and then press ENTER and you will come out of this server so I'm going to close this terminal once again and on the next terminal this time I want to start the spider IDE using this terminal so just write spider and then press ENTER and if you see this message which says segmentation fault or any other error you can first of all update the spider version using the Conda command so just write Conda update spider and then press ENTER which is going to update the version of spider on your bun to operating system and once you have updated the version of spider using Conda you can also run this command which is Conda install and then PI OpenGL ok and then press ENTER once again and now you just need to press Y to proceed and once this command is successful we are going to run this spider command once again in order to launch the spider and you can see the spider is now open so first of all I'm going to click on OK here and in order to run some command or run this Python script I can for example write something here so I just want to write 5 plus 5 and then I can select this line which I have written which is 5 plus 5 and then press shift enter in order to execute this command and you will see here the put of this expression is printed here if you want to execute the whole file for example I will just write here prin and inside the parenthesis I will just print HelloWorld and I will save my file and I can also press this green button which is used to run your Python file and you can see hello world is again printed once again I will just correct the spelling of hello here and then once again I'm going to run this program and you can see this script has been executed by this spider IDE and the output you will be able to see on the console here so this is how you can download and install anaconda with Jupiter notebook and spider IDE I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
