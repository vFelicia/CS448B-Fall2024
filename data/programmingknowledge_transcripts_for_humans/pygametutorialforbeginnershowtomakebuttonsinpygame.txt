00:00 - hey everyone today we're gonna create a
00:03 - button in pi game let's first think what
00:05 - a button does so that you have the basic
00:07 - idea what we'll be doing in the program
00:10 - how would be coding
00:12 - so whenever you click a button click on
00:15 - a button
00:16 - a certain task is performed a function
00:18 - is called so here this function is going
00:20 - to be quit function by pi game to keep
00:23 - it simple and easy whenever I click on
00:25 - that rectangular button on the screen
00:28 - the program should stop and the pi game
00:31 - window should go away
00:32 - also I'd like to add in a functionality
00:35 - whenever I hover over that rectangular
00:37 - box over the button there should be a
00:40 - shade change there should be a slight
00:41 - color change so that I can know the user
00:45 - can know
00:46 - that right now the cursor is over the
00:48 - button cool so let's start coding as
00:51 - usual I would
00:53 - Write the basic steps first and then get
00:56 - to the main code
00:57 - so let's import Pi game I'll write
01:00 - import buy game
01:03 - I'll initialize it right by game dot
01:06 - init
01:07 - then I'll set up the screen I'll write I
01:10 - came dot display.setmode 500 comma 500.
01:14 - what's the screen size then I'll also
01:17 - set up a caption so my caption would be
01:20 - Pi game button
01:22 - and then I'll have my game Loop I'll
01:25 - write while true
01:28 - for events and buygame.even Dot get
01:31 - if events.type equals spygame dot quit
01:35 - I'll call the quit function
01:37 - and then I'll update this entire thing
01:40 - I'll write Pi game dot display dot
01:42 - update
01:44 - so this was the basic code now let's get
01:47 - to the main code since I want a quit
01:50 - button I should have quite written over
01:53 - that rectangular box that would be my
01:56 - button so for that I'll use the font
01:58 - module of course
02:00 - I need to display the text with so for
02:03 - that I'll write font equals
02:05 - spygame.font.sys font
02:07 - and let me take the phone charger
02:11 - and the font size to be 40. let's keep
02:13 - it bold
02:15 - and then I'll render this over the
02:18 - surface so I have the surf variable I'll
02:20 - write font dot render and my message and
02:23 - my text would be quit and I want
02:26 - anti-alias to be true
02:29 - and then the color of this text let it
02:32 - be white fine
02:35 - then I'll have this button that would
02:37 - act as the rectangular box that that
02:40 - would be my button so I'll initialize
02:44 - its initial position and its size so
02:47 - I'll write Pi game dot direct that it's
02:49 - initial Position will be 200 comma 200.
02:52 - kind of in the middle of the screen
02:55 - and its size be 110
02:58 - comma 16. so its width is 110 and its
03:02 - height is 65.
03:04 - then I'll fill my screen with some color
03:08 - you can take any color I have taken pink
03:11 - then
03:13 - inside this for Loop I'll put in this
03:16 - mouse button function functionality I'll
03:19 - I'll check if my events type is mouse
03:21 - button down if I'm using my mouse
03:24 - and check that my cursor is inside this
03:28 - button this rectangular box okay and how
03:32 - do I do that I'll write if button dot
03:34 - Collide point
03:36 - in brackets they are given would be
03:37 - events.position
03:39 - and then I'll call the quit function
03:41 - I'll write Pi game dot quit fine
03:45 - so this is how I checked if my
03:48 - cursor is within this rectangular box is
03:51 - over the button and if it is so if it
03:54 - has been clicked then I'll call the pi
03:57 - game quit function fine now since I
04:00 - wanted to add that color change
04:03 - functionality that hovering and shading
04:06 - functionality I'll get my mouse position
04:08 - I'll get my mouse coordinates the
04:11 - cursor's coordinates so I'll write
04:14 - um a comma b equals spygame dot mouse
04:16 - dot get position so a would be the x
04:19 - coordinate and B would be the y
04:20 - coordinate to avoid confusion I have
04:23 - taken a and b because we'd be already
04:25 - using the X and Y coordinates of my
04:27 - button that rectangular box
04:30 - so let's not have any confusion so my
04:34 - mouse coordinates the x coordinate of my
04:36 - mouse is a and the y coordinate of my
04:39 - mouse is B fine now I'll check if this
04:44 - mouse coordinates if these Mouse
04:46 - coordinates are within my box
04:48 - so for that I'll write if button dot X
04:51 - the x coordinate of my rectangular box
04:54 - is less than equal to a the x coordinate
04:57 - of my cursor is less than equal to
05:01 - button dot X
05:03 - which is the exponent of my rectangular
05:06 - box plus 110 that is the size of my
05:08 - rectangular box that button fine and
05:12 - also I want the button dot y the y
05:16 - coordinate of my rectangular box
05:19 - to be less than or equal to B the y
05:22 - coordinate of my mouse
05:24 - of my cursor
05:26 - to be less than or equal to button dot y
05:29 - plus 60 so the y coordinate of
05:33 - my rectangular box plus 60 because
05:35 - that's the height okay I hope you can
05:39 - visualize this you understand this
05:42 - and then if it is so
05:44 - I'll draw a rectangle I'll do I'll write
05:48 - packing.shaw.rect
05:50 - and screen is the surface I'm gonna draw
05:52 - on I'll given this color this is a
05:55 - lighter shade of gray
05:57 - and the Direct Value is given by button
05:59 - fine and else if it is not so if the
06:03 - cursor is outside this button then I'll
06:06 - given this color a darker shade of gray
06:09 - that's the default color okay
06:12 - and then I'll get my text on the surface
06:16 - button
06:17 - by using blitz so I'll write screen dot
06:19 - BLT
06:21 - surf is the surface of the text and this
06:25 - is for having margins for I've done plus
06:28 - five with the
06:30 - buttons initial coordinates so that I
06:33 - have a margin and things don't overlap
06:35 - the text doesn't overlap with the
06:37 - borders
06:39 - okay then I'll update
06:42 - so I've already written that let's run
06:44 - this and see if my button works
06:54 - so now if I run this I can see my quit
06:57 - button and if I hover over this button I
07:01 - see a shade change it's a lighter shade
07:03 - of gray whenever I hover over this my
07:06 - cursor is over this button and if my
07:09 - cursor is outside
07:11 - somewhere not on this button then it's a
07:14 - darker shade of gray cool so if I click
07:17 - on this button
07:19 - the program should stop let's see if
07:21 - that happens
07:23 - yeah so the window went away and uh
07:26 - the program stopped so I called the quit
07:30 - function using this button you can call
07:32 - any other function you can call in the
07:35 - function to play a song you can call in
07:38 - the function to display a text
07:40 - so
07:41 - this was all of it and I hope you
07:45 - understood how to create a button by a
07:46 - game
07:48 - thank you

hey everyone today we're gonna create a button in pi game let's first think what a button does so that you have the basic idea what we'll be doing in the program how would be coding so whenever you click a button click on a button a certain task is performed a function is called so here this function is going to be quit function by pi game to keep it simple and easy whenever I click on that rectangular button on the screen the program should stop and the pi game window should go away also I'd like to add in a functionality whenever I hover over that rectangular box over the button there should be a shade change there should be a slight color change so that I can know the user can know that right now the cursor is over the button cool so let's start coding as usual I would Write the basic steps first and then get to the main code so let's import Pi game I'll write import buy game I'll initialize it right by game dot init then I'll set up the screen I'll write I came dot display.setmode 500 comma 500. what's the screen size then I'll also set up a caption so my caption would be Pi game button and then I'll have my game Loop I'll write while true for events and buygame.even Dot get if events.type equals spygame dot quit I'll call the quit function and then I'll update this entire thing I'll write Pi game dot display dot update so this was the basic code now let's get to the main code since I want a quit button I should have quite written over that rectangular box that would be my button so for that I'll use the font module of course I need to display the text with so for that I'll write font equals spygame.font.sys font and let me take the phone charger and the font size to be 40. let's keep it bold and then I'll render this over the surface so I have the surf variable I'll write font dot render and my message and my text would be quit and I want antialias to be true and then the color of this text let it be white fine then I'll have this button that would act as the rectangular box that that would be my button so I'll initialize its initial position and its size so I'll write Pi game dot direct that it's initial Position will be 200 comma 200. kind of in the middle of the screen and its size be 110 comma 16. so its width is 110 and its height is 65. then I'll fill my screen with some color you can take any color I have taken pink then inside this for Loop I'll put in this mouse button function functionality I'll I'll check if my events type is mouse button down if I'm using my mouse and check that my cursor is inside this button this rectangular box okay and how do I do that I'll write if button dot Collide point in brackets they are given would be events.position and then I'll call the quit function I'll write Pi game dot quit fine so this is how I checked if my cursor is within this rectangular box is over the button and if it is so if it has been clicked then I'll call the pi game quit function fine now since I wanted to add that color change functionality that hovering and shading functionality I'll get my mouse position I'll get my mouse coordinates the cursor's coordinates so I'll write um a comma b equals spygame dot mouse dot get position so a would be the x coordinate and B would be the y coordinate to avoid confusion I have taken a and b because we'd be already using the X and Y coordinates of my button that rectangular box so let's not have any confusion so my mouse coordinates the x coordinate of my mouse is a and the y coordinate of my mouse is B fine now I'll check if this mouse coordinates if these Mouse coordinates are within my box so for that I'll write if button dot X the x coordinate of my rectangular box is less than equal to a the x coordinate of my cursor is less than equal to button dot X which is the exponent of my rectangular box plus 110 that is the size of my rectangular box that button fine and also I want the button dot y the y coordinate of my rectangular box to be less than or equal to B the y coordinate of my mouse of my cursor to be less than or equal to button dot y plus 60 so the y coordinate of my rectangular box plus 60 because that's the height okay I hope you can visualize this you understand this and then if it is so I'll draw a rectangle I'll do I'll write packing.shaw.rect and screen is the surface I'm gonna draw on I'll given this color this is a lighter shade of gray and the Direct Value is given by button fine and else if it is not so if the cursor is outside this button then I'll given this color a darker shade of gray that's the default color okay and then I'll get my text on the surface button by using blitz so I'll write screen dot BLT surf is the surface of the text and this is for having margins for I've done plus five with the buttons initial coordinates so that I have a margin and things don't overlap the text doesn't overlap with the borders okay then I'll update so I've already written that let's run this and see if my button works so now if I run this I can see my quit button and if I hover over this button I see a shade change it's a lighter shade of gray whenever I hover over this my cursor is over this button and if my cursor is outside somewhere not on this button then it's a darker shade of gray cool so if I click on this button the program should stop let's see if that happens yeah so the window went away and uh the program stopped so I called the quit function using this button you can call any other function you can call in the function to play a song you can call in the function to display a text so this was all of it and I hope you understood how to create a button by a game thank you
