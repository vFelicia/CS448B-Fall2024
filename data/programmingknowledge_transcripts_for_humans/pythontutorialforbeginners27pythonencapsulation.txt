00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python to troll for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will learn how to use
00:06 - encapsulation in Python and capsulation
00:09 - is one of the most important principle
00:12 - in object-oriented programming so let's
00:16 - get started I will be using this car
00:18 - class and the rectangle class which we
00:20 - have been using in the previous videos
00:22 - also and let me remove these print
00:26 - statements because we don't want them
00:29 - right now now let's say we want to
00:31 - change the value of speed so if you want
00:34 - to change the value of speed you can
00:36 - simply take your object for example for
00:40 - dot your attribute name for example
00:42 - speed and then you can directly change
00:45 - it for example 300 and when I run the
00:48 - program it's going to print the new
00:51 - speed which is 300 initially we have set
00:53 - the speed to 200 in here we can also put
00:57 - let's say the speed as string which is
01:00 - very stupid but will it work it works
01:03 - you can see here and this can break the
01:06 - function in which the speed is used so
01:09 - therefore it is very important that we
01:11 - protect our data and only give the
01:14 - access to our data to the other users so
01:18 - encapsulation is particularly important
01:21 - when you want to give your code to some
01:25 - other people because they might want to
01:27 - change your code so let's see how we can
01:29 - encapsulate our code so to encapsulate
01:33 - our code we create functions so let's
01:35 - create our first function which is to
01:38 - set the value of speed so I'm going to
01:41 - just say set underscore speed and inside
01:45 - the parentheses it's going to take self
01:48 - as the first argument which is the
01:49 - default and second is the value of speed
01:53 - so so I can say value here right and
01:56 - then once we have the value of speed we
02:00 - can just call self dot speed is equal to
02:04 - value similarly we can create our get
02:08 - method for the speed so right now we
02:11 - have created the set method to set the
02:13 - speed
02:13 - and now we are going to create a get
02:16 - method to get the speed and in order to
02:20 - get the speed we don't need to pass any
02:23 - argument we just need to return this
02:26 - speed which is already said so we can
02:29 - just write return and then self dot
02:32 - speed so we have created two functions
02:34 - set and get these are also called setter
02:37 - and getter for the attribute which is
02:40 - speed in our case so let's use these
02:43 - functions instead of this kind of
02:46 - setting of data so first of all I am
02:48 - going to call this for object dot set
02:52 - speed method out of this object and then
02:55 - I am going to pass the new speed using
02:57 - this set method now in order to get the
03:00 - speed I can write instead of this for
03:03 - dot speed I can just write the for dot
03:06 - get speed which is going to give me the
03:09 - speed of this Ford object so I'm going
03:13 - to run the code and you can see it
03:15 - prints the speed which we have set using
03:18 - the set method but still will this
03:21 - protect your data let's see so I'm going
03:24 - to once again try to use for dot speed
03:28 - and then I will try to set the new value
03:32 - of speed will it be a problem No so you
03:36 - can see when I try to get the speed the
03:39 - new speed is set and we want to prevent
03:42 - this kind of setting of data using this
03:45 - equals to symbol so we need to somehow
03:48 - make our attribute private now if you
03:53 - are familiar with other object-oriented
03:55 - programming languages like Java or C++
03:58 - they use the keywords like public
04:00 - private or protected in order to mark
04:05 - their attributes or the member variables
04:07 - as the private or public or protected
04:10 - but Python doesn't have any of these
04:14 - keywords so how we can make our data
04:17 - private so let me give you first of all
04:19 - an example so I am going to go to this
04:22 - class which is hello and Here I am going
04:25 - to set some values
04:27 - so first value is for example self dot a
04:31 - is equal to 10 second value is self dot
04:37 - underscore B is equal to 20 and the
04:41 - third value is self dot underscore
04:45 - underscore C is equal to 30 so we have
04:49 - created three member variables in this
04:51 - hello class one is a second is
04:55 - underscore B and the C is with two
04:59 - underscores in front of it and let's try
05:02 - to access all these three values so I am
05:05 - going to just use the print method and
05:08 - then the hello object dot a and
05:11 - similarly I will use this print to get
05:16 - the value of dot underscore B and also
05:21 - dot underscore underscore C now let's
05:25 - try to run this program and let's see
05:28 - what happens and you can see here the
05:30 - first value which is printed here is 10
05:32 - which is the value inside the a variable
05:35 - so this code was executed successfully
05:37 - now we can see here that 20 is also
05:41 - printed that means this code is also
05:43 - executed successfully but at the time of
05:46 - underscore underscore C when we want to
05:49 - use this underscore underscore C outside
05:53 - the class it says hello object has no
05:58 - attribute called underscore underscore C
06:01 - and this is the point
06:02 - so underscore underscore you can use to
06:06 - make your attribute private okay
06:09 - so this is our convention there is no
06:12 - keywords like private in Python that's
06:15 - why python uses this kind of convention
06:18 - in which whenever you use double
06:21 - underscores it makes your data private
06:24 - when you use single underscore that also
06:26 - means that it's a private variable but
06:29 - this is only a convention nothing stops
06:32 - you to change the value of underscore B
06:35 - or accessing the value of underscore B
06:38 - okay so if you truly want to make
06:41 - your data private then use double
06:44 - underscore in front of your variable
06:47 - when you use single underscore that
06:50 - means it's a partially private variable
06:53 - and it's only a convention okay so let's
06:56 - go to our car class once again and now
07:00 - we know that we can add double
07:03 - underscore in front of our variable name
07:06 - so we have two variables here one is
07:09 - speed so let us add double List
07:11 - underscore in front of speed and also
07:14 - let's add double underscore in front of
07:16 - this color variable to make both of them
07:19 - private so I'm going to change this
07:21 - value of speed in getter and setter also
07:24 - and now let's try to access this value
07:27 - using this Ford object which is
07:30 - underscore underscore speed now let's
07:32 - try to run our program so I'm going to
07:33 - change the file and then run our program
07:36 - and you will see that it's going to give
07:38 - us an error and this error says the car
07:41 - object has no attribute called color
07:43 - because this variable color is private
07:47 - now also you will observe that the value
07:51 - of the speed is 300 which is set by this
07:56 - set function even though we have set the
07:59 - speed again to 400 using this underscore
08:03 - underscore speed but this speed is not
08:06 - changed right so we cannot change the
08:09 - speed using this underscore underscore
08:11 - variable because now it's a private
08:14 - variable and that means we cannot change
08:16 - the value using this variable we need to
08:20 - use this set function in order to change
08:23 - the value of the speed also if you want
08:27 - to use this underscore underscore color
08:29 - here and let's run the code this will
08:32 - also give you an error because this
08:34 - underscore underscore color is private
08:36 - so either you can remove this code or
08:39 - you can create the setter and getter
08:41 - method for the color also so let's
08:45 - create the setter and getter method for
08:47 - the color
08:51 - and now we can access the value of color
08:54 - using the get color method right so
08:58 - instead of this get speed we can just
09:00 - write for dot get color and it's going
09:04 - to give us the value of color and now
09:07 - you can see that there is no error and
09:10 - the speed here is 300 which we have set
09:12 - using the set speed method and color is
09:16 - red which is the color we have given
09:19 - using this argument in the constructor
09:22 - and this type of restricting your data
09:24 - access using functions is called
09:27 - encapsulation let's do the same thing
09:30 - with our rectangle class also and let's
09:33 - create the setter and getter method
09:35 - inside the rectangle class so you
09:38 - already know we can use this define and
09:42 - then we can first of all set for example
09:46 - set the height first of all and then we
09:49 - can give the value of height here and
09:51 - then self dot height is equal to height
09:57 - right and don't forget you need to give
10:00 - double underscore in front of your
10:02 - attributes in order to make them private
10:05 - so I'm going to do just that and let's
10:10 - create the get height method also
10:16 - so now we have created the setter and
10:19 - getter for the height and let's do the
10:21 - same for the width also
10:28 - so now you have made the height and
10:30 - width as private and we have created
10:33 - setter and getter for the height and
10:35 - width and now in order to calculate the
10:37 - area we can define one more method here
10:39 - which is the area method so let's create
10:42 - the area method here and this area
10:45 - method is not going to take any argument
10:47 - we are just going to return the
10:49 - multiplication of the height so self dot
10:53 - height multiplied by self dot underscore
10:58 - underscore width okay
11:00 - which will give us the area of this
11:02 - rectangle and we can call this area
11:04 - method instead of using this kind of
11:07 - notation so direct one dot area and rect
11:12 - two dot area also let's run the code by
11:18 - changing the file name here and run this
11:21 - code and you can see the area is printed
11:24 - now so this is how you can use
11:26 - encapsulation in python to hide your
11:29 - data I hope you have enjoyed this video
11:32 - I will see you in the next video

hey guys welcome to the next video on Python to troll for beginners in this video we will learn how to use encapsulation in Python and capsulation is one of the most important principle in

prints the speed which we have set using the set method but still will this protect your data let's see so I'm going to once again try to use for dot speed and then I will try to set the new value of

to go to this class which is hello and Here I am going to set some values so first value is for example self dot a is equal to 10 second value is self dot underscore B is equal to 20 and the third value is self dot underscore underscore C is equal to 30 so we have created three member variables in this hello class one is a second is underscore B and the C is with two underscores in front of it and let's try to access all these three values so I am going to just use the print method and then the hello object dot a and similarly I will use this print to get the value of dot underscore B and also dot underscore underscore C now let's try to run this program and let's see what happens and you can see here the first value which is printed here is 10 which is the value inside the a variable

speed using this underscore underscore variable because now it's a private variable and that means we cannot change the value using this variable we need to use this set function in order to change the value of the speed also if you want to use this underscore underscore color here and let's run the code this will also give you an error because this underscore underscore color is private so either you can remove this code or you can create the setter and getter method for the color also so let's create the setter and getter method for the color and now we can access the value of color using the get color method right so instead of this get speed we can just write for dot get color and it's going to give us the value of color and now you can see that there is no error and the speed here is 300 which we have set using the set speed method and color is red which is the color we have given using this argument in the constructor and this type of restricting your data access using functions is called encapsulation let's do the same thing with our rectangle class also and let's create the setter and getter method inside the rectangle class so you already know we can use this define and then we can first of all set for example set the height first of all and then we can give the value of height here and then self dot height is equal to height right and don't forget you

calculate the area we can define one more method here which is the area method so let's create the area method here and this area method is not going to take any argument we are just going to return the multiplication of the height so self dot height multiplied by self dot underscore underscore width okay which will give us the area of this rectangle and we can call this area method instead of using this kind of notation so direct one dot area and rect two dot area also let's run the code by changing the file name here and run this code and you can see the area is printed now so this is how you can use encapsulation in python to hide your data I hope you have enjoyed this video I will see you in the next video
