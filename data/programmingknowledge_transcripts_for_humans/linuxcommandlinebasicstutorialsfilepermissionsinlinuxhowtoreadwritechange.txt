With timestamps:

00:00 - now in this video we are going to cover
00:01 - the most important topic of how the
00:03 - Linux series that is the permissions
00:04 - okay
00:05 - so uh in this video we will cover the
00:08 - console which lies inside this
00:09 - particular topic and uh commands we will
00:12 - cover in the next video okay
00:14 - so basically uh let me tell you about
00:16 - the permissions I hope you may be aware
00:18 - of it uh but still let me tell you like
00:21 - um
00:22 - I will tell you with one of the example
00:24 - with a real life example suppose you
00:26 - have a PC and you are the administrator
00:28 - of that particular PC
00:29 - and you have some other users like your
00:31 - brother or you can or your sister okay
00:33 - and you have some kind of files okay
00:36 - which you don't want to show those files
00:38 - to that particular user particular your
00:40 - brother okay so in this case what you
00:42 - will do you will specify a particular
00:44 - permission to that file so that file
00:46 - should not visible or should not
00:48 - accessible to other user
00:51 - so in this way we can set permissions to
00:56 - the files or directories or whatever you
00:58 - want so that should not be accessible to
01:01 - other users or other person okay or you
01:04 - want your files to like keep it secret
01:07 - or keep it private you can say
01:09 - so uh I will tell you with the a diagram
01:13 - also so that it will be easy to
01:16 - understand for you guys
01:17 - so here you can see you here is the
01:20 - administrator that you
01:22 - okay
01:25 - and uh
01:30 - suppose here is your brother uh your
01:34 - brother okay or so study you can see
01:38 - and also you have some files also
01:42 - that is
01:45 - I will name it as a
01:47 - private files
01:49 - okay
01:50 - and
01:53 - this one
01:56 - and from this to this
01:59 - you have like you will have the access
02:04 - and your brother will not have the
02:06 - access for it
02:09 - not access okay so in this way you can
02:13 - just understand like this is the private
02:15 - file okay you have the administrator you
02:17 - have the access for it but your brother
02:19 - or sister uh if they want to access this
02:22 - particular file they will get the error
02:25 - like permission denied or something like
02:26 - that okay
02:27 - so in this way permission like you can
02:30 - get the scenario the how permission work
02:32 - okay
02:33 - uh so now uh in our Linux operating
02:36 - system or you can say Ubuntu
02:40 - uh sorry
02:43 - I will show you the permissions Okay so
02:47 - I hope you are aware of Ls command so
02:49 - this command basically doesn't so much
02:52 - information about the what are the
02:54 - permission what is the size who is the
02:56 - user who is the group all this thing it
02:58 - does also but when we'll do LSI funnel
03:00 - then it basically like
03:03 - what we can say long listing description
03:05 - of the files and directories okay
03:08 - wait a minute
03:13 - so in this way
03:15 - here you can see there are multiple
03:17 - columns so I like you will think first
03:19 - like what are these things so I'm not
03:21 - getting anything
03:22 - but here you can see like this is First
03:25 - Column is just for permissions next
03:28 - column is for this is the hard links
03:30 - which we will cover in other videos okay
03:32 - and this is the user who is the user web
03:35 - access of that particular directory and
03:38 - who are the groups and this is the file
03:40 - size date modification date and time
03:43 - these things are there and this is
03:44 - obviously the
03:45 - directory name
03:47 - so right now in this video we don't have
03:49 - to focus on all these other columns like
03:51 - user group we will have a separate video
03:54 - when at the time we use occasion all
03:56 - these things but now in this video we
03:58 - have to only focus on these particular
04:00 - things like only on the First Column
04:02 - what is the
04:04 - drwx WXR what are these things so we
04:07 - will cover
04:09 - now in this video okay
04:13 - so
04:16 - I hope you got it
04:18 - now what I will do
04:26 - increase the font size first
04:29 - let it be 18 not 18.
04:34 - uh
04:35 - 24 yeah
04:42 - uh wait a minute
04:45 - yes
04:46 - first uh I will write the rwx okay
04:51 - again similar thing is we have to do
04:55 - as WX and RW X I will tell you one by
05:02 - one what is these things so basically R
05:04 - what is r
05:06 - R stands for read
05:09 - and uh
05:12 - we have
05:17 - W stands for
05:21 - right
05:23 - okay
05:25 - and x x stands for
05:31 - execute
05:33 - okay
05:37 - so these are the some like notations RW
05:41 - access for the permission in our Linux
05:43 - operating system that is R stands for
05:45 - read it just means suppose you have a
05:47 - file and you want to give that file only
05:49 - the read access to some kind some other
05:51 - user similarly in kind of your brother's
05:54 - sister okay suppose here is you like
05:56 - some documentation you have and
06:00 - you want to show it to your brother so
06:02 - you can give only the read permission to
06:04 - your brother or to your other user like
06:06 - he can only read these files okay
06:09 - and what is the right permission suppose
06:11 - when you will keep the read and write
06:13 - permission to this particular
06:14 - documentation file so in this case
06:16 - suppose uh they are in the same project
06:19 - with you
06:21 - so what will happen they can change
06:23 - these files also according to him and
06:25 - the rwx is nothing but the read write
06:28 - execute it means you will give the all
06:30 - the permissions like execute permission
06:32 - we basically use for the some kind of
06:34 - scripts and all these things like when
06:36 - we will cover basket scripting so you
06:38 - will get to know about this dot sh
06:40 - files and all or we can say dot Pi also
06:43 - for python files okay
06:46 - so these are the things for in the read
06:48 - write execute so I hope you got it what
06:51 - is read what is right what is execute so
06:54 - now here comes why I have written these
06:56 - three three three so here is the reason
06:58 - behind it the first section is only for
07:02 - the user the user uh whoever is the user
07:06 - they will have the like these permission
07:08 - right now they have read write execute
07:09 - all these three permissions okay
07:12 - and next is for group
07:17 - okay
07:20 - and uh next is for
07:24 - uh wait a minute
07:30 - next is for whom
07:32 - other or you can say some other books or
07:36 - some other
07:37 - on net you can get like other world or
07:41 - anything else like
07:42 - okay
07:44 - so uh these are the 3D permission total
07:47 - nine nine permission we have three for
07:49 - user other three for group and other
07:52 - three for other
07:54 - like other world okay so here you can
07:56 - see in our system uh I will make a
08:00 - directory so it will be visible to you
08:05 - and I will try to
08:08 - create One Directory test one
08:13 - and uh
08:18 - Touch file dot txt LS Okay so
08:23 - like here you can see I have created two
08:25 - files like with when you will apply this
08:28 - semicolon then you can write multiple
08:30 - commands in one single line okay I hope
08:32 - you you got to learn new things okay
08:35 - so now I will do uh LSI funnel
08:39 - so here you can see uh the file
08:42 - permissions for uh user
08:45 - and D is for directory and this hyphen
08:48 - is for only for the files okay
08:51 - there are some also other notations
08:52 - which will cover in advanced video okay
08:55 - I mean we will executing commands Okay
08:59 - so here you can see rwx
09:01 - rwx that is how much it
09:04 - uh that is 6 and again r w x okay
09:09 - so here in place of w you can see that
09:12 - is hyphen means it means 0 like uh that
09:15 - other user is not having any permission
09:18 - to write anything inside the directory
09:21 - okay
09:22 - and this rwx rwx the user and the group
09:26 - have all the permissions okay I hope you
09:30 - got it
09:31 - so uh
09:34 - now what we have to do uh now I will
09:37 - tell you about some kind of like uh
09:40 - you can see numeric representation like
09:42 - how we can represent the uh what we can
09:45 - say
09:46 - permissions of this
09:48 - so basically what happens this is in
09:52 - this uh
09:53 - foreign
09:54 - wait a minute
09:56 - for R we basically give a number that is
09:59 - read
10:01 - wait a minute I will write here only
10:07 - here for R we give particular number
10:09 - that is 4 okay
10:12 - and for
10:16 - right we give it to
10:19 - and for one
10:22 - we give it
10:24 - for execute we give it one so overall
10:27 - when you will add all these numbers so
10:30 - for all suppose if you want to give all
10:32 - the permission to some kind of file so
10:35 - in this case you will provide this 777
10:40 - okay it means you are providing seven
10:44 - for user also 7 for group also other
10:50 - seven four
10:52 - other also and suppose uh and also one
10:57 - more is remaining that is zero
10:59 - what is 0 0 is nothing for no permission
11:04 - okay if you will give it 0 to some other
11:08 - like
11:10 - for any case you will give it a zero
11:12 - then
11:15 - they will not have any kind of
11:17 - permissions okay now Suppose there is a
11:21 - file that is uh suppose this
11:23 - documentation file
11:25 - I want to give this as a only
11:28 - uh read and write permission to the no
11:32 - rewrite execute permission to the
11:35 - user so in case of user I will write 4
11:39 - plus 2 plus 1 that is I will write 7 for
11:44 - the user okay
11:47 - and similarly for
11:50 - group
11:52 - what uh for group I just want to give
11:54 - them only
11:56 - what we can say uh write permissions
11:59 - okay
12:01 - so I will just give it them two
12:04 - okay it basically means zero
12:08 - plus two plus zero like it will
12:11 - automatically like uh accept like uh
12:14 - that particular group has only write
12:16 - permissions okay
12:20 - and for
12:22 - other users suppose uh you want to give
12:24 - it as
12:26 - for other I want to give them as six
12:29 - like four plus two plus zero so they
12:33 - will only have the read and write
12:36 - permissions okay
12:40 - so overall what we will write
12:43 - we will write 7 2
12:46 - seven two and
12:49 - six okay
12:54 - all right now I don't want a mouse with
12:57 - me so I'm getting this problem okay
13:01 - so now so to give the permission to like
13:05 - uh for user you want to give them all
13:07 - the permission so we can you can give it
13:09 - simply as seven for group suppose you
13:12 - want to give only the right permission
13:13 - you can give it to or suppose you want
13:16 - to give other on like only uh read and
13:20 - write permission so you can give it four
13:21 - plus two thirty six so the overall like
13:25 - uh number which you will provide in the
13:28 - CH mode command that is the
13:31 - uh 726
13:33 - so what uh when you don't want to give
13:36 - any permission to the other user so in
13:38 - this case you can
13:39 - give it them as a zero suppose uh the
13:42 - same scenario like you want to give
13:44 - group S2 so what you can do that is
13:46 - seven to zero simple
13:49 - so uh I hope you got it the concept of
13:51 - rewrite execute and how this is divided
13:54 - like r w x r double x r double X what is
13:57 - this
13:58 - three like we have
14:01 - like a separate permission for read
14:04 - write execute for one user then for
14:06 - group for other and also I hope you got
14:09 - this representation of numeric okay
14:13 - in binary also we can represent like for
14:15 - four I think we represent
14:17 - uh one double zero and yeah let me write
14:22 - it for binary also
14:30 - so for binary we write one double zero
14:33 - and uh for four for two I think we write
14:37 - uh uh it's uh zero one zero it may be uh
14:42 - I hope I am correct
14:45 - uh wait a minute
14:50 - so for two what we write uh zero one
14:53 - zero and the for one uh it's I think
14:57 - zero zero one
14:59 - should be zero zero one
15:04 - okay
15:05 - so let me check it once also I don't
15:08 - want to like share wrong information
15:09 - with you guys uh for in binary
15:16 - it's one double zero okay
15:23 - yeah here you can see one double zero
15:25 - and for two it should be zero one zero
15:29 - yeah U zero and zero is there
15:32 - uh
15:35 - we can get like 0 1 0 it is there and
15:37 - for one we will get
15:40 - yeah zero one okay
15:43 - so this is correct so in binary also you
15:46 - got to learn about how we can write in
15:48 - the binary also
15:49 - so uh that's all for today's video I
15:52 - hope you liked

Cleaned transcript:

now in this video we are going to cover the most important topic of how the Linux series that is the permissions okay so uh in this video we will cover the console which lies inside this particular topic and uh commands we will cover in the next video okay so basically uh let me tell you about the permissions I hope you may be aware of it uh but still let me tell you like um I will tell you with one of the example with a real life example suppose you have a PC and you are the administrator of that particular PC and you have some other users like your brother or you can or your sister okay and you have some kind of files okay which you don't want to show those files to that particular user particular your brother okay so in this case what you will do you will specify a particular permission to that file so that file should not visible or should not accessible to other user so in this way we can set permissions to the files or directories or whatever you want so that should not be accessible to other users or other person okay or you want your files to like keep it secret or keep it private you can say so uh I will tell you with the a diagram also so that it will be easy to understand for you guys so here you can see you here is the administrator that you okay and uh suppose here is your brother uh your brother okay or so study you can see and also you have some files also that is I will name it as a private files okay and this one and from this to this you have like you will have the access and your brother will not have the access for it not access okay so in this way you can just understand like this is the private file okay you have the administrator you have the access for it but your brother or sister uh if they want to access this particular file they will get the error like permission denied or something like that okay so in this way permission like you can get the scenario the how permission work okay uh so now uh in our Linux operating system or you can say Ubuntu uh sorry I will show you the permissions Okay so I hope you are aware of Ls command so this command basically doesn't so much information about the what are the permission what is the size who is the user who is the group all this thing it does also but when we'll do LSI funnel then it basically like what we can say long listing description of the files and directories okay wait a minute so in this way here you can see there are multiple columns so I like you will think first like what are these things so I'm not getting anything but here you can see like this is First Column is just for permissions next column is for this is the hard links which we will cover in other videos okay and this is the user who is the user web access of that particular directory and who are the groups and this is the file size date modification date and time these things are there and this is obviously the directory name so right now in this video we don't have to focus on all these other columns like user group we will have a separate video when at the time we use occasion all these things but now in this video we have to only focus on these particular things like only on the First Column what is the drwx WXR what are these things so we will cover now in this video okay so I hope you got it now what I will do increase the font size first let it be 18 not 18. uh 24 yeah uh wait a minute yes first uh I will write the rwx okay again similar thing is we have to do as WX and RW X I will tell you one by one what is these things so basically R what is r R stands for read and uh we have W stands for right okay and x x stands for execute okay so these are the some like notations RW access for the permission in our Linux operating system that is R stands for read it just means suppose you have a file and you want to give that file only the read access to some kind some other user similarly in kind of your brother's sister okay suppose here is you like some documentation you have and you want to show it to your brother so you can give only the read permission to your brother or to your other user like he can only read these files okay and what is the right permission suppose when you will keep the read and write permission to this particular documentation file so in this case suppose uh they are in the same project with you so what will happen they can change these files also according to him and the rwx is nothing but the read write execute it means you will give the all the permissions like execute permission we basically use for the some kind of scripts and all these things like when we will cover basket scripting so you will get to know about this dot sh files and all or we can say dot Pi also for python files okay so these are the things for in the read write execute so I hope you got it what is read what is right what is execute so now here comes why I have written these three three three so here is the reason behind it the first section is only for the user the user uh whoever is the user they will have the like these permission right now they have read write execute all these three permissions okay and next is for group okay and uh next is for uh wait a minute next is for whom other or you can say some other books or some other on net you can get like other world or anything else like okay so uh these are the 3D permission total nine nine permission we have three for user other three for group and other three for other like other world okay so here you can see in our system uh I will make a directory so it will be visible to you and I will try to create One Directory test one and uh Touch file dot txt LS Okay so like here you can see I have created two files like with when you will apply this semicolon then you can write multiple commands in one single line okay I hope you you got to learn new things okay so now I will do uh LSI funnel so here you can see uh the file permissions for uh user and D is for directory and this hyphen is for only for the files okay there are some also other notations which will cover in advanced video okay I mean we will executing commands Okay so here you can see rwx rwx that is how much it uh that is 6 and again r w x okay so here in place of w you can see that is hyphen means it means 0 like uh that other user is not having any permission to write anything inside the directory okay and this rwx rwx the user and the group have all the permissions okay I hope you got it so uh now what we have to do uh now I will tell you about some kind of like uh you can see numeric representation like how we can represent the uh what we can say permissions of this so basically what happens this is in this uh foreign wait a minute for R we basically give a number that is read wait a minute I will write here only here for R we give particular number that is 4 okay and for right we give it to and for one we give it for execute we give it one so overall when you will add all these numbers so for all suppose if you want to give all the permission to some kind of file so in this case you will provide this 777 okay it means you are providing seven for user also 7 for group also other seven four other also and suppose uh and also one more is remaining that is zero what is 0 0 is nothing for no permission okay if you will give it 0 to some other like for any case you will give it a zero then they will not have any kind of permissions okay now Suppose there is a file that is uh suppose this documentation file I want to give this as a only uh read and write permission to the no rewrite execute permission to the user so in case of user I will write 4 plus 2 plus 1 that is I will write 7 for the user okay and similarly for group what uh for group I just want to give them only what we can say uh write permissions okay so I will just give it them two okay it basically means zero plus two plus zero like it will automatically like uh accept like uh that particular group has only write permissions okay and for other users suppose uh you want to give it as for other I want to give them as six like four plus two plus zero so they will only have the read and write permissions okay so overall what we will write we will write 7 2 seven two and six okay all right now I don't want a mouse with me so I'm getting this problem okay so now so to give the permission to like uh for user you want to give them all the permission so we can you can give it simply as seven for group suppose you want to give only the right permission you can give it to or suppose you want to give other on like only uh read and write permission so you can give it four plus two thirty six so the overall like uh number which you will provide in the CH mode command that is the uh 726 so what uh when you don't want to give any permission to the other user so in this case you can give it them as a zero suppose uh the same scenario like you want to give group S2 so what you can do that is seven to zero simple so uh I hope you got it the concept of rewrite execute and how this is divided like r w x r double x r double X what is this three like we have like a separate permission for read write execute for one user then for group for other and also I hope you got this representation of numeric okay in binary also we can represent like for four I think we represent uh one double zero and yeah let me write it for binary also so for binary we write one double zero and uh for four for two I think we write uh uh it's uh zero one zero it may be uh I hope I am correct uh wait a minute so for two what we write uh zero one zero and the for one uh it's I think zero zero one should be zero zero one okay so let me check it once also I don't want to like share wrong information with you guys uh for in binary it's one double zero okay yeah here you can see one double zero and for two it should be zero one zero yeah U zero and zero is there uh we can get like 0 1 0 it is there and for one we will get yeah zero one okay so this is correct so in binary also you got to learn about how we can write in the binary also so uh that's all for today's video I hope you liked
