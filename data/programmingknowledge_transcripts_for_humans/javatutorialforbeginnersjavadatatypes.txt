With timestamps:

00:00 - we'll be learning about the data types
00:02 - in Java so what are the data types data
00:05 - type specifies the different sizes and
00:07 - values that can be stored in the
00:08 - variable so in the previous video we
00:10 - have learned about the variables so we
00:13 - can here data type is nothing but it
00:15 - declares the which type of the data it's
00:17 - going to store inside the memory okay so
00:19 - here you can see the chart of the
00:21 - different types of data types are there
00:22 - you can pause the video and you can look
00:24 - into this I'll be teaching you each each
00:27 - and every type how what type of the data
00:30 - it is going to store okay so moving next
00:34 - it here is here is a chart you can see
00:37 - so in the First Column the name of the
00:39 - data type is there in the default value
00:41 - means if you don't assign the value to
00:43 - the data type what value it gonna store
00:45 - inside it by default okay and here's the
00:48 - default size that how how much memory it
00:51 - will consume if you declare that type of
00:52 - the data type inside your code okay so
00:55 - let's suppose if I declare integer
00:57 - integer variable of data type
01:00 - so the default size it will hold this of
01:03 - four bytes okay so enough talking about
01:05 - the data types we will see in detail in
01:08 - the code in this video okay so let's
01:11 - just talk about the keywords keywords in
01:13 - Java are also known as Reserve words
01:15 - okay the keywords are particular words
01:17 - that act as a key to the code these are
01:21 - the nothing but the predefined words by
01:22 - Java so that you cannot be used as a
01:25 - variable or object name or a class name
01:27 - okay so there are basically uh I think I
01:32 - guess 48 48 keywords rewards Reserve
01:34 - keywords are there in Java which you
01:36 - cannot use either as a variable name
01:39 - object name or the class name I will
01:41 - show in the show you in the code part so
01:44 - enough talking about the theoretical
01:46 - path let's code it
01:47 - I will jump into my IDE
01:50 - IntelliJ IDEA
01:54 - okay
01:56 - stick till the end I will be announcing
01:58 - some
01:59 - new announcement is there for you guys
02:01 - so that you can learn
02:04 - more efficiently in this whole series
02:07 - okay
02:09 - so and I don't want any tip come here
02:13 - click on right click on the SRC
02:16 - click on new and the new Java class so
02:20 - today we are learning data types so I
02:22 - will give this
02:24 - file name as data types okay
02:29 - okay so come inside this declare your
02:32 - main class
02:34 - main method sorry
02:36 - and inside main method so let's go and
02:40 - see each data types one by one okay
02:44 - so first of all we will be talking about
02:46 - the Boolean data type okay so Boolean
02:49 - data type is it used to store only two
02:51 - values let me show you okay so for
02:54 - example if I declare
02:58 - Boolean
03:00 - first of all let me increase the font
03:02 - size I don't know how to increase it
03:06 - okay let it be I guess you guys are
03:09 - getting what I am telling time to tell
03:11 - you okay Boolean one
03:13 - is equal to
03:15 - false okay
03:18 - okay and
03:19 - I will do
03:21 - system.out.printlain and print one okay
03:25 - so if I click here run
03:30 - see guys what will happen
03:33 - let me hide this project
03:36 - okay so you can see false get printed on
03:39 - the console okay so as you can see I
03:42 - have declared one Boolean data type one
03:46 - and variable name is one and I have
03:49 - assign it the value to be false okay so
03:52 - if I write here true and again I click
03:55 - on the Run
03:57 - see it will give it true okay and if I
04:01 - write anything else one two
04:04 - C IntelliJ IDEA is throwing some error
04:07 - let's take it
04:09 - so here it was telling that the one
04:12 - variable that I have that I have
04:14 - declared is a type of Boolean and we I I
04:18 - am trying to store the integer value
04:20 - inside it so that can cannot be
04:23 - happen okay
04:24 - so now I will show you if I declare this
04:29 - one Boolean one and I am trying to print
04:32 - the one okay
04:33 - so here it again I get error variable
04:36 - one might not be have initialized so I
04:40 - have to initialize it whether as false
04:43 - okay or true it's up to you but
04:48 - remember it will going to hold only one
04:50 - two types okay either false or either
04:53 - true
04:55 - okay so next data type is a
04:58 - short data type so short data type is a
05:01 - 16-bit assigned to complement integer
05:04 - and its value lies in between minus 32
05:08 - 768 to 32
05:11 - 767 okay
05:13 - that's the theoretical part I will show
05:15 - you the implementation right away okay
05:18 - short
05:19 - s is equal to let me assign it the value
05:22 - let's suppose ten thousand
05:26 - I guess it is right okay
05:28 - and I will declare another short
05:33 - okay in the variable name is r
05:37 - okay and I will assign it the value of
05:40 - minus 5000.
05:42 - okay
05:44 - and I will simply print s
05:49 - Plus
05:52 - R okay
05:54 - and if I click run
05:59 - see the values are going to be printed
06:01 - on the console so short is the derived
06:04 - which holds
06:05 - these values okay so next is float
06:10 - next come float let me comment this out
06:13 - first
06:15 - yeah let's go so float is nothing but
06:18 - that does when you when you are
06:21 - trying to store the data which is in the
06:24 - point or decimal okay so what I'm trying
06:27 - today let me give you with the example
06:30 - float
06:31 - F1 is equal to
06:35 - 234.50
06:39 - okay
06:42 - uh I guess wait a wait a minute wait a
06:45 - minute
06:47 - float F1
06:49 - and F okay
06:51 - and if I try to print now
06:56 - float F1 okay
06:59 - and if I try to click on run
07:02 - here the float value is 2.5 is going to
07:05 - print it okay so you have to write F
07:07 - value that you are storing the float
07:10 - values inside of float variable okay
07:12 - so this is this is for float and now
07:16 - integer comes okay
07:19 - its integer is simple straightforward
07:20 - into a is equal to you can assign any
07:24 - value okay let's suppose 250 okay
07:27 - and inside this I will print
07:31 - the variable name a
07:33 - and if I click run
07:36 - now here you can see 250 get printed on
07:38 - this console okay
07:41 - so these are the data types and yet more
07:44 - to come we will learn all those data
07:46 - types when we are going to learn all
07:49 - those data structures Parts Okay so
07:53 - let me get back to the keyword and the
07:55 - keywords are nothing but the reservers
07:57 - you cannot use that words uh to declare
08:00 - any variable name object name and class
08:02 - name inside your code okay
08:04 - so enough talking so in upcoming videos
08:08 - we are going to see one exercise is
08:11 - coming for you guys I expect you guys to
08:14 - answer those exercise and we will be
08:16 - seeing solution for those exercise
08:18 - questions in the upcoming videos okay so
08:21 - the announcement is that I have created
08:23 - one uh repository for you guys and I
08:26 - will be uploading all those PDF
08:28 - resources that I have these are the
08:31 - nodes I will uploading all those nodes
08:33 - inside that repository and the core part
08:35 - this part I'll be uploading all these
08:37 - codes in as of as a file inside this
08:40 - repository you can you guys can access
08:42 - this repository and download the code as
08:44 - well as the PDF part and the link to the
08:48 - repository will be provided in the video
08:50 - description you can access
08:52 - and
08:53 - get the help from it so thank you guys
08:56 - for
08:57 - watching this video I will see in the
08:59 - next one thank you

Cleaned transcript:

we'll be learning about the data types in Java so what are the data types data type specifies the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable so in the previous video we have learned about the variables so we can here data type is nothing but it declares the which type of the data it's going to store inside the memory okay so here you can see the chart of the different types of data types are there you can pause the video and you can look into this I'll be teaching you each each and every type how what type of the data it is going to store okay so moving next it here is here is a chart you can see so in the First Column the name of the data type is there in the default value means if you don't assign the value to the data type what value it gonna store inside it by default okay and here's the default size that how how much memory it will consume if you declare that type of the data type inside your code okay so let's suppose if I declare integer integer variable of data type so the default size it will hold this of four bytes okay so enough talking about the data types we will see in detail in the code in this video okay so let's just talk about the keywords keywords in Java are also known as Reserve words okay the keywords are particular words that act as a key to the code these are the nothing but the predefined words by Java so that you cannot be used as a variable or object name or a class name okay so there are basically uh I think I guess 48 48 keywords rewards Reserve keywords are there in Java which you cannot use either as a variable name object name or the class name I will show in the show you in the code part so enough talking about the theoretical path let's code it I will jump into my IDE IntelliJ IDEA okay stick till the end I will be announcing some new announcement is there for you guys so that you can learn more efficiently in this whole series okay so and I don't want any tip come here click on right click on the SRC click on new and the new Java class so today we are learning data types so I will give this file name as data types okay okay so come inside this declare your main class main method sorry and inside main method so let's go and see each data types one by one okay so first of all we will be talking about the Boolean data type okay so Boolean data type is it used to store only two values let me show you okay so for example if I declare Boolean first of all let me increase the font size I don't know how to increase it okay let it be I guess you guys are getting what I am telling time to tell you okay Boolean one is equal to false okay okay and I will do system.out.printlain and print one okay so if I click here run see guys what will happen let me hide this project okay so you can see false get printed on the console okay so as you can see I have declared one Boolean data type one and variable name is one and I have assign it the value to be false okay so if I write here true and again I click on the Run see it will give it true okay and if I write anything else one two C IntelliJ IDEA is throwing some error let's take it so here it was telling that the one variable that I have that I have declared is a type of Boolean and we I I am trying to store the integer value inside it so that can cannot be happen okay so now I will show you if I declare this one Boolean one and I am trying to print the one okay so here it again I get error variable one might not be have initialized so I have to initialize it whether as false okay or true it's up to you but remember it will going to hold only one two types okay either false or either true okay so next data type is a short data type so short data type is a 16bit assigned to complement integer and its value lies in between minus 32 768 to 32 767 okay that's the theoretical part I will show you the implementation right away okay short s is equal to let me assign it the value let's suppose ten thousand I guess it is right okay and I will declare another short okay in the variable name is r okay and I will assign it the value of minus 5000. okay and I will simply print s Plus R okay and if I click run see the values are going to be printed on the console so short is the derived which holds these values okay so next is float next come float let me comment this out first yeah let's go so float is nothing but that does when you when you are trying to store the data which is in the point or decimal okay so what I'm trying today let me give you with the example float F1 is equal to 234.50 okay uh I guess wait a wait a minute wait a minute float F1 and F okay and if I try to print now float F1 okay and if I try to click on run here the float value is 2.5 is going to print it okay so you have to write F value that you are storing the float values inside of float variable okay so this is this is for float and now integer comes okay its integer is simple straightforward into a is equal to you can assign any value okay let's suppose 250 okay and inside this I will print the variable name a and if I click run now here you can see 250 get printed on this console okay so these are the data types and yet more to come we will learn all those data types when we are going to learn all those data structures Parts Okay so let me get back to the keyword and the keywords are nothing but the reservers you cannot use that words uh to declare any variable name object name and class name inside your code okay so enough talking so in upcoming videos we are going to see one exercise is coming for you guys I expect you guys to answer those exercise and we will be seeing solution for those exercise questions in the upcoming videos okay so the announcement is that I have created one uh repository for you guys and I will be uploading all those PDF resources that I have these are the nodes I will uploading all those nodes inside that repository and the core part this part I'll be uploading all these codes in as of as a file inside this repository you can you guys can access this repository and download the code as well as the PDF part and the link to the repository will be provided in the video description you can access and get the help from it so thank you guys for watching this video I will see in the next one thank you
