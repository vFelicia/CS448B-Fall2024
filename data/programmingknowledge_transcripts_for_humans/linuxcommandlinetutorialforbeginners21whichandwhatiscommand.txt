00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video I'm going to
00:06 - show you how we can use which command
00:09 - and what is command in Linux so let's
00:12 - see first of all what is which command
00:15 - and how we can use it the which command
00:17 - is used to you know return the part name
00:21 - of a file or a command which we use with
00:25 - this which command so let's see how we
00:28 - can use it so to use the which command
00:30 - you just need to write which and the
00:32 - command a name so for example Alice ok
00:37 - and this will give you so for example I
00:39 - will press ENTER and this will give me
00:42 - the location of this LS command or
00:47 - wherever this LS executable is located
00:51 - right for example in the last video I
00:53 - wanted to know the path location of the
00:57 - bash so I have done something like this
01:00 - which bash and it has given this
01:02 - location to us right now this which
01:06 - command will help you whenever you will
01:10 - be writing much of the bash scripting
01:12 - and in bash scripting it's a good
01:15 - practice to you know use the full path
01:19 - of the command line name so instead of
01:21 - using LS in bash scripting for example
01:25 - so let's open our script first of all
01:28 - Nano which we have created in the last
01:30 - video so I'm just going to open the
01:33 - first of all CD to the desktop and then
01:37 - Nano to my script which we have created
01:41 - in the last video right so in Linux it's
01:44 - in best scripting specially it's a good
01:47 - practice to use the location full
01:50 - location for example bin slash forward
01:53 - slash LS right which is the full
01:56 - location of this LS command and then I
01:59 - will just you know exit out of it and
02:03 - whenever I execute this my script once
02:08 - again it will give me the same result so
02:13 - sometimes whenever you use your script
02:16 - in different operating system some
02:19 - recognizes your Alice command some wants
02:22 - you to give the full path of the for
02:26 - example any command which you use so
02:28 - this is the full command so this is
02:31 - where the witch command will be helpful
02:33 - to you to know the location of any for
02:36 - example command for example I want to
02:40 - know the location of let's say Firefox
02:46 - and press enter and you can see it's
02:49 - located here so user bin Firefox right
02:53 - so for example I want to know the
02:56 - location of cat so bin cat right so in
03:01 - this way you can know the location of
03:03 - any you know command using this which
03:07 - come on now what is a what is come on so
03:11 - let's see how we can use what is command
03:14 - so I'm going to clear the terminal and
03:16 - then this time we are going to use the
03:19 - what is command so what is command is
03:23 - going to display the short manual page
03:26 - description so as I have been you know
03:30 - telling you to use man pages for example
03:32 - man LS and I will just press ENTER it
03:36 - gives this man page which gives the
03:39 - information about you know LS what it
03:42 - does and essentially this what is
03:45 - command is going to return you short
03:49 - description of this LS command which is
03:51 - there in the main page for example this
03:54 - description so let's see how we can use
03:57 - this you know what is come on so just
04:00 - write what is something like this and
04:05 - then LS and press ENTER and you can see
04:08 - it gives the short description of this
04:11 - LS command which is there in the main
04:13 - pages itself so if you wanted to know
04:16 - what this command is doing so you just
04:19 - can just do what is LS or or any command
04:23 - so let's say I want to do what
04:26 - is a Firefox for example and it gives a
04:30 - free and open source web browser for
04:32 - Mozilla right and this come on which we
04:37 - haven't seen for example grab we will
04:41 - see it in the later video what is it but
04:43 - let's see what is it so it is used to
04:47 - print line matching a pattern right and
04:51 - let's say what is a cat command and it's
04:55 - a concatenation so it is used contact
04:57 - catenation files and print on the
05:00 - standard output so what is command you
05:03 - can use to display a short description
05:05 - of a command which is present in the man
05:09 - pages also so this is how you can use
05:12 - which and what is command in Linux I
05:14 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can use which command and what is command in Linux so let's see first of all what is which command and how we can use it the which command is used to you know return the part name of a file or a command which we use with this which command so let's see how we can use it so to use the which command you just need to write which and the command a name so for example Alice ok and this will give you so for example I will press ENTER and this will give me the location of this LS command or wherever this LS executable is located right for example in the last video I wanted to know the path location of the bash so I have done something like this which bash and it has given this location to us right now this which command will help you whenever you will be writing much of the bash scripting and in bash scripting it's a good practice to you know use the full path of the command line name so instead of using LS in bash scripting for example so let's open our script first of all Nano which we have created in the last video so I'm just going to open the first of all CD to the desktop and then Nano to my script which we have created in the last video right so in Linux it's in best scripting specially it's a good practice to use the location full location for example bin slash forward slash LS right which is the full location of this LS command and then I will just you know exit out of it and whenever I execute this my script once again it will give me the same result so sometimes whenever you use your script in different operating system some recognizes your Alice command some wants you to give the full path of the for example any command which you use so this is the full command so this is where the witch command will be helpful to you to know the location of any for example command for example I want to know the location of let's say Firefox and press enter and you can see it's located here so user bin Firefox right so for example I want to know the location of cat so bin cat right so in this way you can know the location of any you know command using this which come on now what is a what is come on so let's see how we can use what is command so I'm going to clear the terminal and then this time we are going to use the what is command so what is command is going to display the short manual page description so as I have been you know telling you to use man pages for example man LS and I will just press ENTER it gives this man page which gives the information about you know LS what it does and essentially this what is command is going to return you short description of this LS command which is there in the main page for example this description so let's see how we can use this you know what is come on so just write what is something like this and then LS and press ENTER and you can see it gives the short description of this LS command which is there in the main pages itself so if you wanted to know what this command is doing so you just can just do what is LS or or any command so let's say I want to do what is a Firefox for example and it gives a free and open source web browser for Mozilla right and this come on which we haven't seen for example grab we will see it in the later video what is it but let's see what is it so it is used to print line matching a pattern right and let's say what is a cat command and it's a concatenation so it is used contact catenation files and print on the standard output so what is command you can use to display a short description of a command which is present in the man pages also so this is how you can use which and what is command in Linux I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
