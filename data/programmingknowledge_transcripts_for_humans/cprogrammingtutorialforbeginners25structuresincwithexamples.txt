00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - video this is John from programming
00:06 - knowledge and in this video guys we're
00:08 - gonna be learning structures in C so
00:12 - we're going to explore what is
00:15 - structures and how we could you know use
00:18 - structures inside our C program so
00:21 - basically guys when we say structure it
00:24 - is a user user-defined data type and
00:29 - it's used to store a collection of
00:31 - different kinds of data so in a sense it
00:36 - could be something similar to an array
00:39 - so basically it it's like a collection
00:42 - the only difference is that an array is
00:45 - used to store the same data types so in
00:49 - an array if you want to save an integer
00:51 - value so you have to make sure that all
00:55 - the elements of that particular array is
00:57 - also int or integer and if you want to
01:01 - store a double so it should have double
01:05 - or it should you know contain all double
01:09 - elements while if you want to use
01:13 - structure you could declare multiple
01:19 - datatype inside this particular
01:22 - collection so in order for us to use
01:27 - structure in C we're gonna be using this
01:30 - particular keyword struct okay so this
01:35 - is how we could create a structure in C
01:39 - programming so struck so variables
01:42 - inside the structure are called members
01:45 - of the structure okay
01:48 - so now let's try to define a structure
01:51 - in C so say for example we want to try
01:58 - to declare a struct courses so all we
02:02 - have to do is specify the keyword strap
02:06 - okay and then this is going to you know
02:09 - make sense later on if we want to access
02:12 - the
02:13 - the members of this particular strap so
02:16 - for now let's just stick to this strap
02:19 - is the keyword that we could use to you
02:22 - know declare or define any structure in
02:25 - C so again that's the keyword strap and
02:28 - then we could specify the structure name
02:34 - so this could be any any name that you
02:37 - want to for example we could name this
02:39 - courses okay so this particular courses
02:46 - this will contain different variables
02:49 - okay so as you can see here we have
02:52 - added curly braces opening and closing
02:55 - curly braces and then at the end of the
02:59 - closing curly brace this semicolon that
03:02 - signifies the end of this particular
03:04 - line okay and then inside here as I have
03:08 - said we could have multiple variable
03:11 - type okay so for example number one will
03:19 - be charged or car and then we could name
03:24 - this for example website and then the
03:28 - length is 50 okay and then semicolon and
03:34 - another one car or char and then subject
03:40 - will be the length 50 and then the last
03:48 - one the last one will be about price
03:51 - okay so as you can see here guys we have
03:55 - these trap courses and then it contains
04:00 - three different data types of variable
04:05 - so we have here website with 950 subject
04:08 - land 50 and then price which is an int
04:12 - or of typed-in okay that's how easy for
04:16 - us to you know define a structure in C
04:19 - now we could access this the strap
04:27 - courses but basically we need to move
04:31 - this outside of our main function so we
04:36 - have to move this I'll just have to cut
04:41 - and paste this so it should be outside
04:43 - our main function because we're going to
04:47 - declare or I mean access the strap from
04:52 - this main function right here okay
04:56 - so you could think of this if you are
05:00 - into object-oriented programming you
05:03 - could think of this as a class right now
05:05 - but this is different because this is a
05:09 - structure which is a collection of you
05:12 - know different variables or different
05:14 - data types but you can think of this as
05:17 - you know an object or a class right now
05:21 - and then we could access this inside our
05:23 - main function so in order for us to
05:26 - access that we just need to specify the
05:30 - name of our strap inside our main
05:36 - function so all we have to do is use
05:38 - again the strap keyword like this and
05:43 - then the name of this trap which is
05:47 - corss okay and then we could assign an
05:54 - alias to this a for example course or
05:58 - maybe see a big letter C okay big letter
06:03 - C okay and then semicolon so that's how
06:06 - we can access this courses strap inside
06:11 - our main function so all we have to do
06:14 - is like use the struct keyword in the
06:19 - name of our struct which is courses and
06:21 - then assign assign an alias of this
06:24 - strap okay
06:26 - and then after that one we could
06:29 - initialize perhaps our variables okay or
06:37 - members of this straw
06:39 - so all you have to do is you could say
06:43 - here initialization we could now access
06:47 - the members of the strap courses by
06:50 - using this alias so initially solution
06:53 - for example STR copy okay so I believe I
07:00 - I have already showed you how you could
07:04 - assign a value to a string because we're
07:07 - gonna be assigning value to this website
07:09 - so this is a string collection of
07:12 - characters so strcpy and then we're
07:18 - gonna say here c and then website so as
07:25 - you can see here we have the access to
07:28 - all the members of the courses struck so
07:34 - we're gonna use the website first and
07:35 - then we're going to assign a value here
07:39 - for example triple w programming
07:45 - knowledge something like that so
07:49 - basically what we're doing here dot come
07:52 - we're just doing here is were just
07:57 - getting the website member and then
08:03 - assign a value to that which is the
08:06 - triple w dot programming knowledge calm
08:08 - and after this we could you know access
08:12 - the this value by using this member of
08:16 - strap so later on we will try that but
08:20 - for now let's just move to the next
08:22 - member so again we're going to use str
08:26 - copy strcpy and then now we're going to
08:32 - use the subject subject so the sub the
08:40 - subject will be introduction to c
08:46 - programming
08:49 - so that will be the subject for this
08:51 - particular course so again we're just
08:54 - doing here we're just getting the
08:58 - subject member of our strap and then
09:01 - assign a value to that which is this
09:04 - string introduction to C programming
09:08 - okay and of course the other one or the
09:12 - last one will be the price so what we do
09:17 - here is use the C alias that and then
09:21 - price and then we could assign a value
09:24 - here for example we want to specify a
09:29 - value or a price here like fifteen
09:32 - dollars or something and then after that
09:35 - after initialization of course you can
09:37 - use the these values right here so all
09:42 - we have to do is we can say here print
09:44 - so we could use print F statement and
09:48 - then we could say here website percent
09:55 - semicolon R :
09:57 - and then percent s and then we're going
10:01 - to add new line here comma and then the
10:06 - member of our strap so see that and then
10:12 - website okay and then semicolon at the
10:15 - end so we're going to do the same for
10:18 - the other members so the next one is the
10:25 - subject so percent as then backslash n
10:33 - and then we're going to access the
10:38 - subject member of strap and then the
10:42 - last one will be wind F I'm in the price
10:47 - so price we're going to do the same here
10:51 - percent D that's the format specifier
10:56 - for our integer values
10:59 - so see that price okay and then
11:04 - semicolon at the end of this line to
11:06 - denote that this ends with this
11:10 - semicolon okay so now let's try this
11:13 - let's build and run a program and we
11:17 - were having an error here I respected
11:21 - because expected that's because we
11:27 - didn't we did not add the semicolon here
11:30 - okay rookie mistake build and run and as
11:34 - you can see here we now have the values
11:39 - displayed here in our console so the
11:42 - website is triple W that programming
11:44 - comm and then subject is introduction to
11:47 - C programming and the price is $15 so
11:52 - that's how easy for us to use struck in
11:54 - C and then we could you know make this
11:59 - collection of different variables and
12:03 - then we could assign values initialize
12:05 - and then we could also change if you
12:08 - want to change the values after
12:09 - initialization and then after that we
12:12 - could display the values or the actual
12:14 - values of the members of our struck okay
12:18 - so I think that's it for this tutorial
12:21 - guys and I do hope that you learn
12:23 - something from this tutorial and if you
12:27 - have questions please let us know in the
12:29 - comment section where we will try to
12:31 - answer your queries so again that's all
12:36 - there is to it in this tutorial and
12:38 - thank you for watching

types so in an array if you want to save an integer value so you have to make sure that all the elements of that particular array is also int or integer and if you want to store a double so it should have double or it should you know contain all double elements while if you want to use structure you could declare multiple datatype inside this particular collection so in order for us to use structure in C we're gonna be using this particular keyword struct okay so this is how we could create a structure in C programming so struck so variables inside the structure are called members of the structure okay so now let's try to define a structure in C so say for example we want to try to declare a struct courses so all we have to do is specify the keyword strap okay and then this is

this particular courses this will contain different variables okay so as you can see here we have added curly braces opening and closing curly braces and then at the end of the closing curly brace this semicolon that signifies the end of this particular line okay and then inside here as I have said we could have multiple variable type okay so for example number one will be charged or car and then we could name this for example website and then the length is 50 okay and then semicolon and another one car or char and then subject will be the length 50 and then the last one the last one will be about price okay so as you can see here guys we have these trap courses and then it contains three different data types of variable so we have here website with 950 subject land 50 and then price which is an int or of typedin okay that's how easy for us to you know define a structure in C now we could access this the strap courses but basically we need to move this outside of our main function so we have to move this I'll just have to cut and paste this so it should be outside our main function because we're going to declare or I mean access the strap from this main function right here okay

that but for now let's just move to the next member so again we're going to use str copy strcpy and then now we're going to use the subject subject so the sub the subject will be introduction to c
