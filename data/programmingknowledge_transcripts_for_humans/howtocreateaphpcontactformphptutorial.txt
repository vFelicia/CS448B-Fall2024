00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge and this is
00:05 - another video tutorial series and in
00:08 - this particular series we will be
00:11 - learning how to create contact form in
00:13 - PHP with MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so
00:18 - at the end of this video tutorial series
00:20 - we will have this particular contact
00:23 - form with all these fields first name
00:27 - last name email and others and we should
00:31 - be able to send email when we try to
00:34 - send or click on this button so let's go
00:39 - ahead and create our new project so I
00:41 - have created a directory contact form
00:43 - with index dot PHP and also with custom
00:48 - that CSS files so let's try to open up
00:51 - this index dot PHP file in our code
00:54 - editor so in here we have the empty
00:58 - index dot PHP file so I'll be passing
01:01 - the base structure of our index dot PHP
01:04 - so now we have the HTML structure of our
01:09 - index dot PHP we have the title contact
01:12 - form and then programming knowledge we
01:15 - have set meta attributes we also
01:20 - included the bootstrap minified CSS so
01:23 - in this version or we have included the
01:25 - version 4.1 point we see SS and we also
01:30 - included a fun from google api s-- you
01:34 - can pause the video and try to copy all
01:36 - the contents here and we also included
01:39 - this custom CSS that we have defined in
01:42 - our directory here and then we have
01:46 - defined the div with class container and
01:52 - row we also define column xl8 inside
02:01 - this division we have defined h1 with
02:06 - the link for our website so contact form
02:09 - tutorial front
02:11 - programming knowledge and we also
02:13 - included the paragraph that says this is
02:18 - a demo for a tutorial dedicated to
02:19 - crafting working boots or contact form
02:22 - with PHP and Ajax in the background and
02:27 - before the closing body tag we also have
02:30 - included different scripts say for
02:33 - example we have included the jQuery
02:35 - minified at Jes so again version 3.3
02:39 - point one another script will be the
02:43 - popper ejs with version one point
02:46 - fourteen point three another script
02:49 - bootstrap that mean unified that Jes and
02:53 - also the validator that minified or that
02:59 - mean that jeaious we also have defined a
03:04 - script read contact GS as the source so
03:09 - we will be creating this file later on
03:12 - you can search for the CDN for this
03:15 - files okay to include in your project
03:18 - jQuery we have the bootstrap we have
03:21 - deep operate that we defy the GS and
03:23 - also with the validator that means a J's
03:26 - you could search for this CDN in the
03:28 - Internet and include that into this part
03:32 - right here just right above the closing
03:36 - body tag and inside this division we
03:41 - will be putting in the form for our
03:44 - contact form so I'll just go ahead and
03:49 - paste the canta form element okay we
03:55 - need to indent this so it would be
03:59 - readable for us so we have the form
04:02 - element with ID contact - form we have
04:05 - the method post the action instead of
04:08 - contact that PHP let us set this into
04:11 - index dot PHP and the role is for we
04:18 - have also added div with class messages
04:21 - and here already control
04:25 - so they've class controls we will define
04:28 - another day with class row and let's add
04:33 - another div with class column medium six
04:39 - and inside this division we will be
04:43 - adding the forum group div and inside
04:48 - this day we will be having the label for
04:51 - our first name one of the most important
04:54 - tags here the input for our first name
04:57 - of course we have the ID for underscore
05:02 - name with type text' name which is yes
05:08 - name and class form control placeholder
05:13 - will be please enter your your first
05:16 - name and of course this is a required
05:19 - field and also we will be having the dip
05:24 - with the class helped block with errors
05:28 - okay the same thing with the last name
05:33 - so column medium six form group label
05:38 - for our last name and input name so we
05:44 - have input ID with form last name form
05:49 - underscore last name with type tags we
05:52 - also have the name as the surname class
05:55 - the same form control placeholder please
06:01 - enter your last name required field and
06:06 - we have this help now again here
06:13 - so div have block with errors classes
06:17 - and we will add another row that will
06:23 - hold the second row which will be for
06:26 - our email and the specific need that we
06:30 - are trying to request so for example we
06:32 - have request for occupation request
06:35 - order status
06:36 - require a request copy of an invoice and
06:39 - other so again this is for email we will
06:44 - define the the grid form - group class
06:48 - label for email and input ID for email
06:55 - type email the name for this field will
06:59 - be email of course and class s for
07:03 - control placeholder will be enter your
07:08 - email course and required field again
07:11 - and this will be for our help block if
07:16 - there are errors also with errors and
07:19 - here this is a bit different from other
07:23 - fields so we have defined the form group
07:26 - and label and this will be the select or
07:31 - the drop-down box that we will be seeing
07:35 - later in our form so we have the first
07:38 - option will be empty the second will be
07:41 - request for quotation this third one
07:44 - will be request order status and the
07:46 - fourth one will be this request copy of
07:50 - an invoice we have another row for our
07:54 - message so column medium child form
07:59 - group label for our message with the
08:03 - four attribute set to form underscore
08:06 - message which is this idea right here so
08:11 - text area ID equals four underscore
08:14 - message name of this text area s message
08:19 - form control again place holder will be
08:24 - message for me and the standard help
08:30 - block with errors live with all these
08:33 - classes right here and the last will be
08:36 - the submit button of our fourth so then
08:41 - class
08:42 - column medium child and an input type
08:46 - submit class BTN BTN - success BTN - Sen
08:52 - with the values and message so save your
08:58 - file for now and let's try to preview
09:02 - our index dot PHP so let's go ahead go
09:06 - to our browser and navigate to this
09:11 - localhost / contact form or whatever the
09:17 - directory you have created earlier so in
09:19 - my case that is contact form so if I try
09:23 - to refresh this page so we will have
09:30 - this contact form with all the elements
09:33 - that we have added so the first name
09:37 - last name email the specific request and
09:41 - the message and also the button right
09:45 - here so in the last tutorial we have
09:47 - laid out the basic structure of our
09:50 - contact form we have created the form
09:53 - with the ID contact - form method post'
09:58 - and action index that page P so we'll
10:02 - just change this into contact page B
10:05 - [Music]
10:07 - instead of index dot PHP and we also
10:10 - have defined the class or div with the
10:13 - class messages right in which we will
10:15 - display all the messages if we have
10:18 - message such as errors and feedbacks
10:23 - coming from our contact form so in this
10:28 - tutorial we will continue working on
10:30 - with this contact form and we will add
10:34 - the contact that that page be fine okay
10:39 - so we have prayed that the contact that
10:41 - page P file and in this particular
10:44 - script we will handle the sending of
10:47 - email okay so we'll just open up the
10:51 - page P tag here
10:57 - so in the first part of this script we
11:01 - will configure basic variables that we
11:03 - need so the first one will be from the
11:07 - second will be sent to the third one
11:17 - will be subject new message from contact
11:33 - form another one will be fields so under
11:39 - subject fields and then other one is all
11:47 - cream message the other one is error
11:53 - message and let's just set default
12:02 - values for this
12:03 - so the for a prom will be the demo
12:07 - platform and with the demo at domain.com
12:16 - we will just set the same for the same
12:19 - two variable egg the open message or the
12:30 - okay message will be platform
12:35 - [Music]
12:38 - successfully submitted I will get back
12:45 - to you
12:53 - and the error message will be there were
12:57 - errors while sending email this field
13:05 - variable is of type array and inside
13:09 - this we're gonna need to set few
13:13 - elements for name the second one will be
13:19 - learning third this phone number or it's
13:49 - the other way around so this will be
13:51 - phone in the capital P and also will be
14:00 - email so this will be message and in
14:23 - here we need to set the error warning
14:27 - this will be e and notice but if you
14:45 - don't need an error or thing you can
14:47 - just set this into something like error
14:51 - reporting and an inside bracket or
14:54 - parentheses is the value 0 and
15:00 - and our sending logic should be wrap
15:04 - around to try and catch block assumption
15:09 - and exception variable so first we're
15:18 - going to check if the count of our post
15:24 - variable is not equal to zero or meaning
15:29 - the size of our post variable is not
15:32 - equal to zero or equal to zero then
15:36 - we'll just throw exception new text
15:47 - option form is empty okay and below this
16:07 - line you need to define a new variable
16:13 - which is email tax you have a new
16:21 - message from your demo back slash n and
16:38 - here we'll just we'll just define our
16:45 - add a new for each block and we'll pass
16:50 - in the post variable as key value pairs
16:56 - and we're just going to check if the
17:05 - value or the key is set so field reveals
17:12 - and then the key curly braces braces if
17:19 - the fields with the key is set in fields
17:25 - variable which is the array that we have
17:28 - defined above
17:29 - then we need to concatenate our email
17:33 - texts read the value fields and then the
17:43 - key column between the value box /n and
17:49 - me to wrap this with double code okay
17:56 - save our HP file and we need to
18:00 - terminate the this particular line and
18:07 - we need to set the headers of our emails
18:10 - so headers equals array with content
18:21 - type X slash plain and of course the
18:28 - character set will be utf-8 - eh okay
18:48 - and then from
18:59 - dot from and then reply to trying to
19:14 - force the origin originating email and
19:19 - return will also be the from variable
19:31 - which is the origin eighteen a min and
19:35 - and then right below this line we need
19:41 - to call on the method mail send to which
19:47 - is the recipient of our email the
19:50 - subject and then the email text and then
19:56 - we need to implode the headers semicolon
20:18 - and then we're sponsoring equals three
20:26 - and I success message will be set the
20:46 - option message that we have defined
20:47 - earlier and of course if there's an
20:53 - error or there's an exception we could
20:57 - set the response or into something
21:01 - a danger and then of course the message
21:05 - will be the error message that we have
21:07 - to find okay and below this line you
21:10 - just have to check if the requests is by
21:15 - Ajax and then if the request is by Ajax
21:20 - then return the JSON response that we
21:22 - have defined so if not and the server
21:30 - and then HTTP X quested win and let's
21:43 - just copy this so server and then your
21:54 - are to lower server HTTP X requested
22:00 - with equals let's just check if this is
22:04 - coming from XML HTTP request okay and
22:12 - the next is to encode the response re
22:25 - spy our JSON in whole instead of the
22:29 - code so response array and of course we
22:34 - need to set the header for this content
22:37 - type
22:39 - because application or see we calendar
22:42 - called application slash Jason and let
22:49 - go hold it hey save our contact that PHP
22:54 - file so in the last tutorial we have
22:56 - added the contact that page provide or
22:59 - modify the contact that PHP file to
23:02 - actually send in process or message or
23:07 - recipient subject and all the fields
23:11 - necessary for our contact form
23:14 - so in this tutorial we will be working
23:17 - on with this index dot PHP and we will
23:20 - be adding all the Java scripts needed to
23:23 - process the sending of email so if you
23:28 - try to go to the end of this file we
23:32 - will see the script which is contact
23:34 - that yes we need to add this contact JS
23:38 - file to our project so we'll just go
23:41 - ahead and create the contact that J is
23:44 - fine okay
23:48 - then saying for now so on a contact that
23:52 - GS so in here we'll just need to add the
24:02 - function short end function of jQuery of
24:06 - document unload and we'll just select
24:14 - the contact form and we just need to
24:19 - validate it start on validator and we
24:27 - will also add a submit function for our
24:33 - contact form so this will be that time
24:36 - and it said me and then function e then
24:51 - let's just close this for now next is we
24:57 - need to check if the validator validate
25:02 - this sent prevent form submit so that's
25:13 - F either prevent or is before
25:22 - default prevented then open curly braces
25:28 - or open and closed curly braces and we
25:32 - need to specify our URL witches contact
25:37 - that HP that we have defined in the
25:39 - previous video contact and HP HP and
25:47 - here we will post values to the URL so
25:53 - let's just use the Ajax request with all
25:58 - the parameters that needs or that needs
26:03 - to set so that is post the type of this
26:09 - request exposed and the URL will will be
26:13 - deeper and defying top and the data will
26:17 - be coming from our former force this and
26:24 - let's just serialize form and if the
26:30 - request is successful let's just define
26:34 - a new function the London it so this
26:38 - will be data in a foreign the open and
26:42 - close curly braces so as we all know
26:45 - that the data is the case and object
26:50 - that we received we received from one
26:54 - time that page so we'll just build the
27:02 - research under turn and we need to build
27:10 - a message alert here message alert and
27:16 - this will be depending on the response
27:21 - coming from all that PHP so this will be
27:25 - the data time and we need to set also
27:30 - the texts so message thanks
27:34 - that will be also coming for more
27:37 - contact at pH piece of data message and
27:41 - below this we need to set the alert box
27:45 - for our feedback so we need to define a
27:50 - dip
27:52 - ready class alert okay so I think we
28:01 - need to interchange this instead out of
28:03 - the code we need to use a single code
28:07 - and this will be the chemical also and
28:17 - we need to add the tie coming from our
28:21 - index or any contact at HP so that will
28:26 - be the message alert and also we need to
28:32 - add another class for this which is
28:35 - alert - disposable then we need to add a
28:42 - bottle to this so let's button and of
28:49 - course using bottom half and inside this
28:55 - opening time we need to specify a type
28:59 - which is a type button and as we close
29:06 - and data this miss equals dirt and area
29:19 - hidden it what's true and we need to
29:26 - specify also the icon or the display or
29:31 - our close button which is the x okay
29:37 - we'll just close the div element or our
29:44 - message alert so there
29:47 - and we need to specify the message
29:52 - that's okay and close this line with the
29:59 - same column so right below this line we
30:04 - need to check if we have message alert
30:10 - and we have the message tax so if we
30:20 - have those two we need to reject be
30:25 - lured into the messages that message is
30:32 - still just a tip that we want to or
30:40 - where we want to display the message of
30:43 - our contact form so platform time as
30:56 - much as relative with the class messages
30:59 - and we're just going to set the HTML
31:03 - into our alert box and also the conduct
31:12 - or will be or we need to reset our
31:17 - contact form so let's reset and open
31:24 - close parenthesis and semicolon after
31:28 - this line after the line for our Ajax so
31:32 - you just need to return post so the next
31:38 - step is to test the project we need to
31:44 - test our project locally first and then
31:46 - we will upload this into into the server
31:48 - later on so let's go ahead and open up
31:51 - this project from our browser so here we
31:56 - are at our browser and we'll
31:58 - we'll try to track our contact for bit
32:02 - if it's working or not because I'll be
32:05 - amazed and we if you don't have errors
32:08 - in our code so first we're going to
32:13 - check if we have errors in our console
32:16 - so click on this hamburger icon and web
32:19 - developer and click on this web console
32:24 - so as you can see we don't have errors
32:27 - for this page ok so it's a good thing
32:32 - now we need to test the form itself so
32:39 - let's just type in somebody's here and
32:44 - John Doe at gmail.com specify a request
32:49 - for quotation this is or testing
32:53 - purposes only and then click on the send
32:59 - message so we have an error in or
33:04 - contact that PHP file on line 28 so
33:07 - we'll try to fix this so looking our
33:12 - code contact at PHP in line 28 we have
33:16 - this so instead of having the semicolon
33:21 - we just need to delete this one and save
33:24 - our file and go back to our browser we
33:29 - just need to save this contact is also
33:31 - so same so we need to refresh our page
33:40 - and send a message okay so we have
33:53 - failed to connect to mail server at
33:56 - localhost port for the port 25 verify
34:00 - your SMTP and so on so basically this
34:04 - means that our contact at PHP file is
34:07 - working but we don't have
34:10 - a working meal or SMTP setup in our
34:15 - local host so we need to upload this to
34:17 - our server so before uploading I did
34:22 - some tests and definitely we have
34:24 - several keywords that we have mistyped
34:27 - so so for example in our contact at PHP
34:30 - so instead of STR - L o L wer so it
34:36 - should be steered to lowercase to lower
34:39 - and we need to add also an else block
34:43 - here response array and pass in the
34:50 - message then close and also in our index
34:55 - dot PHP I think we have an error here so
34:58 - in our forum or opening form tag we have
35:02 - added the option to contact at PHP so
35:07 - instead of doing this here we need to
35:09 - remove this because we're doing all the
35:12 - submission by the jQuery file or the
35:16 - JavaScript file so save this one and
35:20 - also in our contact that Jas we this
35:25 - type here is default prevent so it
35:27 - should be is default prevented change
35:30 - that wine and save so it is now time to
35:36 - upload our project online so you could
35:39 - choose whatever FTP client you're going
35:42 - to use so for me I use the FTP 20
35:46 - FileZilla FTP client so this is the lab
35:50 - version of our contact form and we're
35:53 - just going to test and send a test
35:56 - message so we just need to fill out this
35:59 - form so first name will be John the last
36:02 - name is no the email is John Doe
36:07 - gmail.com and we just need to specify
36:09 - what our specific needs are so say for
36:12 - example request rotation and
36:17 - for our message let's just say this is
36:21 - an email from the awesome on top form
36:28 - created by from knowledge and then click
36:34 - on the send message okay so we have here
36:39 - the nice-looking alert contact form
36:42 - successfully submitted I will get back
36:44 - to you so we'll check the email if we
36:47 - got even from this form so we have here
36:51 - the test email that we have sent from
36:55 - our contact form if you can find the
36:58 - email in your inbox you can check your
37:01 - spam folder because sometimes our most
37:04 - of the time if you have unrecognized
37:07 - domain it will always end up in the spam
37:11 - folder so I think that's it for this
37:14 - tutorial thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is another video tutorial series and in this particular series we will be learning how to create contact form in PHP with MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so at the end of this video tutorial series we will have this particular contact form with all these fields first name last name email and others and we should be able to send email when we try to send or click on this button so let's go ahead and create our new project so I have created a directory contact form with index dot PHP and also with custom that CSS files so let's try to open up this index dot PHP file in our code editor so in here we have the empty index dot PHP file so I'll be passing the base structure of our index dot PHP so now we have the HTML structure of our index dot PHP we have the title contact form and then programming knowledge we have set meta attributes we also included the bootstrap minified CSS so in this version or we have included the version 4.1 point we see SS and we also included a fun from google api s you can pause the video and try to copy all the contents here and we also included this custom CSS that we have defined in our directory here and then we have defined the div with class container and row we also define column xl8 inside this division we have defined h1 with the link for our website so contact form tutorial front programming knowledge and we also included the paragraph that says this is a demo for a tutorial dedicated to crafting working boots or contact form with PHP and Ajax in the background and before the closing body tag we also have included different scripts say for example we have included the jQuery minified at Jes so again version 3.3 point one another script will be the popper ejs with version one point fourteen point three another script bootstrap that mean unified that Jes and also the validator that minified or that mean that jeaious we also have defined a script read contact GS as the source so we will be creating this file later on you can search for the CDN for this files okay to include in your project jQuery we have the bootstrap we have deep operate that we defy the GS and also with the validator that means a J's you could search for this CDN in the Internet and include that into this part right here just right above the closing body tag and inside this division we will be putting in the form for our contact form so I'll just go ahead and paste the canta form element okay we need to indent this so it would be readable for us so we have the form element with ID contact form we have the method post the action instead of contact that PHP let us set this into index dot PHP and the role is for we have also added div with class messages and here already control so they've class controls we will define another day with class row and let's add another div with class column medium six and inside this division we will be adding the forum group div and inside this day we will be having the label for our first name one of the most important tags here the input for our first name of course we have the ID for underscore name with type text' name which is yes name and class form control placeholder will be please enter your your first name and of course this is a required field and also we will be having the dip with the class helped block with errors okay the same thing with the last name so column medium six form group label for our last name and input name so we have input ID with form last name form underscore last name with type tags we also have the name as the surname class the same form control placeholder please enter your last name required field and we have this help now again here so div have block with errors classes and we will add another row that will hold the second row which will be for our email and the specific need that we are trying to request so for example we have request for occupation request order status require a request copy of an invoice and other so again this is for email we will define the the grid form group class label for email and input ID for email type email the name for this field will be email of course and class s for control placeholder will be enter your email course and required field again and this will be for our help block if there are errors also with errors and here this is a bit different from other fields so we have defined the form group and label and this will be the select or the dropdown box that we will be seeing later in our form so we have the first option will be empty the second will be request for quotation this third one will be request order status and the fourth one will be this request copy of an invoice we have another row for our message so column medium child form group label for our message with the four attribute set to form underscore message which is this idea right here so text area ID equals four underscore message name of this text area s message form control again place holder will be message for me and the standard help block with errors live with all these classes right here and the last will be the submit button of our fourth so then class column medium child and an input type submit class BTN BTN success BTN Sen with the values and message so save your file for now and let's try to preview our index dot PHP so let's go ahead go to our browser and navigate to this localhost / contact form or whatever the directory you have created earlier so in my case that is contact form so if I try to refresh this page so we will have this contact form with all the elements that we have added so the first name last name email the specific request and the message and also the button right here so in the last tutorial we have laid out the basic structure of our contact form we have created the form with the ID contact form method post' and action index that page P so we'll just change this into contact page B instead of index dot PHP and we also have defined the class or div with the class messages right in which we will display all the messages if we have message such as errors and feedbacks coming from our contact form so in this tutorial we will continue working on with this contact form and we will add the contact that that page be fine okay so we have prayed that the contact that page P file and in this particular script we will handle the sending of email okay so we'll just open up the page P tag here so in the first part of this script we will configure basic variables that we need so the first one will be from the second will be sent to the third one will be subject new message from contact form another one will be fields so under subject fields and then other one is all cream message the other one is error message and let's just set default values for this so the for a prom will be the demo platform and with the demo at domain.com we will just set the same for the same two variable egg the open message or the okay message will be platform successfully submitted I will get back to you and the error message will be there were errors while sending email this field variable is of type array and inside this we're gonna need to set few elements for name the second one will be learning third this phone number or it's the other way around so this will be phone in the capital P and also will be email so this will be message and in here we need to set the error warning this will be e and notice but if you don't need an error or thing you can just set this into something like error reporting and an inside bracket or parentheses is the value 0 and and our sending logic should be wrap around to try and catch block assumption and exception variable so first we're going to check if the count of our post variable is not equal to zero or meaning the size of our post variable is not equal to zero or equal to zero then we'll just throw exception new text option form is empty okay and below this line you need to define a new variable which is email tax you have a new message from your demo back slash n and here we'll just we'll just define our add a new for each block and we'll pass in the post variable as key value pairs and we're just going to check if the value or the key is set so field reveals and then the key curly braces braces if the fields with the key is set in fields variable which is the array that we have defined above then we need to concatenate our email texts read the value fields and then the key column between the value box /n and me to wrap this with double code okay save our HP file and we need to terminate the this particular line and we need to set the headers of our emails so headers equals array with content type X slash plain and of course the character set will be utf8 eh okay and then from dot from and then reply to trying to force the origin originating email and return will also be the from variable which is the origin eighteen a min and and then right below this line we need to call on the method mail send to which is the recipient of our email the subject and then the email text and then we need to implode the headers semicolon and then we're sponsoring equals three and I success message will be set the option message that we have defined earlier and of course if there's an error or there's an exception we could set the response or into something a danger and then of course the message will be the error message that we have to find okay and below this line you just have to check if the requests is by Ajax and then if the request is by Ajax then return the JSON response that we have defined so if not and the server and then HTTP X quested win and let's just copy this so server and then your are to lower server HTTP X requested with equals let's just check if this is coming from XML HTTP request okay and the next is to encode the response re spy our JSON in whole instead of the code so response array and of course we need to set the header for this content type because application or see we calendar called application slash Jason and let go hold it hey save our contact that PHP file so in the last tutorial we have added the contact that page provide or modify the contact that PHP file to actually send in process or message or recipient subject and all the fields necessary for our contact form so in this tutorial we will be working on with this index dot PHP and we will be adding all the Java scripts needed to process the sending of email so if you try to go to the end of this file we will see the script which is contact that yes we need to add this contact JS file to our project so we'll just go ahead and create the contact that J is fine okay then saying for now so on a contact that GS so in here we'll just need to add the function short end function of jQuery of document unload and we'll just select the contact form and we just need to validate it start on validator and we will also add a submit function for our contact form so this will be that time and it said me and then function e then let's just close this for now next is we need to check if the validator validate this sent prevent form submit so that's F either prevent or is before default prevented then open curly braces or open and closed curly braces and we need to specify our URL witches contact that HP that we have defined in the previous video contact and HP HP and here we will post values to the URL so let's just use the Ajax request with all the parameters that needs or that needs to set so that is post the type of this request exposed and the URL will will be deeper and defying top and the data will be coming from our former force this and let's just serialize form and if the request is successful let's just define a new function the London it so this will be data in a foreign the open and close curly braces so as we all know that the data is the case and object that we received we received from one time that page so we'll just build the research under turn and we need to build a message alert here message alert and this will be depending on the response coming from all that PHP so this will be the data time and we need to set also the texts so message thanks that will be also coming for more contact at pH piece of data message and below this we need to set the alert box for our feedback so we need to define a dip ready class alert okay so I think we need to interchange this instead out of the code we need to use a single code and this will be the chemical also and we need to add the tie coming from our index or any contact at HP so that will be the message alert and also we need to add another class for this which is alert disposable then we need to add a bottle to this so let's button and of course using bottom half and inside this opening time we need to specify a type which is a type button and as we close and data this miss equals dirt and area hidden it what's true and we need to specify also the icon or the display or our close button which is the x okay we'll just close the div element or our message alert so there and we need to specify the message that's okay and close this line with the same column so right below this line we need to check if we have message alert and we have the message tax so if we have those two we need to reject be lured into the messages that message is still just a tip that we want to or where we want to display the message of our contact form so platform time as much as relative with the class messages and we're just going to set the HTML into our alert box and also the conduct or will be or we need to reset our contact form so let's reset and open close parenthesis and semicolon after this line after the line for our Ajax so you just need to return post so the next step is to test the project we need to test our project locally first and then we will upload this into into the server later on so let's go ahead and open up this project from our browser so here we are at our browser and we'll we'll try to track our contact for bit if it's working or not because I'll be amazed and we if you don't have errors in our code so first we're going to check if we have errors in our console so click on this hamburger icon and web developer and click on this web console so as you can see we don't have errors for this page ok so it's a good thing now we need to test the form itself so let's just type in somebody's here and John Doe at gmail.com specify a request for quotation this is or testing purposes only and then click on the send message so we have an error in or contact that PHP file on line 28 so we'll try to fix this so looking our code contact at PHP in line 28 we have this so instead of having the semicolon we just need to delete this one and save our file and go back to our browser we just need to save this contact is also so same so we need to refresh our page and send a message okay so we have failed to connect to mail server at localhost port for the port 25 verify your SMTP and so on so basically this means that our contact at PHP file is working but we don't have a working meal or SMTP setup in our local host so we need to upload this to our server so before uploading I did some tests and definitely we have several keywords that we have mistyped so so for example in our contact at PHP so instead of STR L o L wer so it should be steered to lowercase to lower and we need to add also an else block here response array and pass in the message then close and also in our index dot PHP I think we have an error here so in our forum or opening form tag we have added the option to contact at PHP so instead of doing this here we need to remove this because we're doing all the submission by the jQuery file or the JavaScript file so save this one and also in our contact that Jas we this type here is default prevent so it should be is default prevented change that wine and save so it is now time to upload our project online so you could choose whatever FTP client you're going to use so for me I use the FTP 20 FileZilla FTP client so this is the lab version of our contact form and we're just going to test and send a test message so we just need to fill out this form so first name will be John the last name is no the email is John Doe gmail.com and we just need to specify what our specific needs are so say for example request rotation and for our message let's just say this is an email from the awesome on top form created by from knowledge and then click on the send message okay so we have here the nicelooking alert contact form successfully submitted I will get back to you so we'll check the email if we got even from this form so we have here the test email that we have sent from our contact form if you can find the email in your inbox you can check your spam folder because sometimes our most of the time if you have unrecognized domain it will always end up in the spam folder so I think that's it for this tutorial thanks
