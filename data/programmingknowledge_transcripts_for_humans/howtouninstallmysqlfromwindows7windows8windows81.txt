00:07 - MySQL server and MySQL workbench from
00:13 - your Windows
00:15 - 7 computer so let's get
00:20 - started first of
00:22 - all to uninstall your MySQL go
00:26 - to your start button here and and go
00:32 - to control
00:34 - panel and then go to
00:38 - programs
00:40 - here and then click programs and
00:44 - features and in here you will find your
00:51 - MySQL
00:53 - software so let's
00:56 - see these are my MySQL software so I
01:00 - will click click it and press
01:07 - uninstall so it
01:10 - will remove this file
01:13 - from
01:17 - your
01:20 - PC but it's not enough to remove these
01:23 - files from here
01:25 - itself but you need to delete all the
01:29 - file from from other location which I
01:31 - will show you in some seconds
01:37 - so it's preparing to remove the
01:47 - software and it remove myos softare in
01:52 - the same way my SQL workbench I will
01:56 - remove
02:08 - and it's
02:18 - moving so basically what you need to do
02:21 - is whatever file related to my SQL you
02:25 - need to
02:27 - remove via this process
02:32 - and when you are done with these things
02:36 - then go to
02:38 - your C
02:41 - drive computer and go to this folder
02:46 - program files
02:49 - 86 just see this I will show you once
02:56 - again this is my computer C drive
03:00 - and in here I will go to program
03:04 - 86 and in
03:06 - here you will find this MySQL folder
03:10 - just delete this
03:14 - folder okay it's
03:17 - deleted and then once again go to your
03:21 - [Music]
03:23 - c c folder and go to program files this
03:27 - time and in here all also search
03:31 - for my SQL folder if it's there at all
03:37 - in my case I could cannot find MySQL so
03:41 - if you have any MySQL folder just delete
03:45 - it
03:46 - also
03:48 - and the third thing
03:54 - is go here
04:05 - go to this folder and your C file go to
04:10 - program
04:11 - data
04:13 - some times for example in my case I
04:17 - could not find
04:19 - directly this folder into my
04:23 - C C
04:25 - folder let's see if I go there I cannot
04:31 - find that folder here so I what I
04:35 - generally do is I will just go this here
04:41 - and I will paste this link
04:46 - c/ program data with no space in between
04:50 - and I press enter and it opens my folder
04:55 - program data and here search for MySQL
05:00 - and if it's present there just delete
05:04 - that folder
05:06 - also okay and the third thing
05:14 - is go to
05:16 - your computers C drive and then go
05:24 - to
05:26 - users and if this folder is present app
05:30 - data click this and in here if you find
05:34 - any MySQL folder just delete it
05:40 - also
05:42 - so from these four folder you have to
05:46 - delete your
05:49 - MySQL files and just uninstall any MySQL
05:55 - software from
05:56 - here and
06:00 - if you do that you have successfully
06:04 - uninstalled your MySQL from your
06:07 - computer so from the next time you will
06:11 - be able to install a new
06:15 - MySQL software or reinstall your new
06:20 - MySQL version of software once again so
06:24 - I hope this will help
