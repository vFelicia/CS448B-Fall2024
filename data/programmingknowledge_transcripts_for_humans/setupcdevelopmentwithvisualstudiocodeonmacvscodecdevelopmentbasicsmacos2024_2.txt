00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set up the C programming
00:04 - development environment on your Visual
00:06 - Studio code editor on your Mac operating
00:10 - system so before setting up the C
00:13 - development environment with our Visual
00:15 - Studio code you need to have the C
00:18 - compiler installed on your Mac operating
00:22 - system which is used to compile your C
00:25 - or C++ programs so first of all for that
00:29 - you need to open open your terminal so
00:31 - just click on this Spotlight and then
00:34 - and then search for the terminal and
00:35 - then open the terminal here and then
00:38 - give this command which is
00:40 - cang and then space hyphen hyen version
00:45 - and then presenter and if it gives you
00:48 - this kind of output which says Apple
00:50 - cang version and the version is listed
00:53 - here and uh you also have this kind of
00:56 - information that means the cang comp
00:59 - compiler is installed on your Mac
01:01 - operating system and you will be able to
01:04 - compile your C programs using cang now
01:08 - if this uh command doesn't give any uh
01:12 - output like this and it gives uh the
01:15 - error and it will say cang is not
01:18 - recognized then you need to install the
01:22 - compiler to install the cang compiler
01:25 - you need to install the xcode
01:28 - development tools there are two ways of
01:31 - installing xcode development tools you
01:33 - can download the xcode from the App
01:36 - Store so just search for xcode in the
01:40 - App Store and download the xcode from
01:42 - here but this xcode package when you
01:45 - download it from the Apple store then it
01:49 - comes with other tools so it comes
01:52 - bundled with different uh sdks and
01:55 - development tools like xcode IDE itself
01:58 - and then the support for or um Mac OS
02:02 - development Swift iOS development and
02:06 - many other tool chains so it's around 7
02:08 - or 8 GB of data uh you need to download
02:12 - if you want C length just for the C++
02:15 - development you can also uh give this
02:18 - command on your terminal which is xcode
02:22 - hyphen select space hyphen hyphen
02:24 - install and then press enter and it's
02:27 - going to start the installation of xod
02:30 - on your Mac operating system and it's
02:33 - going to install the cang also when you
02:37 - run this command when I run this command
02:40 - it gives me uh this kind of error which
02:42 - says command line tool is already
02:44 - installed because I have already
02:46 - installed the xcode development tools so
02:49 - it says use the software update to
02:51 - update the xcode otherwise I have
02:55 - already installed the xcode select tool
02:59 - once that's done done just run the cang
03:01 - command once again and then you will see
03:03 - this kind of output once cang compiler
03:06 - is uh installed just open your Visual
03:09 - Studio code and let's open a folder
03:12 - where you want to develop your C code so
03:15 - I'm am going to uh go to my documents
03:18 - folder and here I have this demo C
03:20 - folder I'm going to add this folder in
03:24 - my visual studio code and this folder is
03:27 - right now empty so let's create a C file
03:29 - here so I'm going to click on this plus
03:33 - button here which is going to create a
03:35 - new file and then I'm going to name my
03:38 - file as main. C and then press enter as
03:41 - soon as I uh create a c or C++ file on
03:45 - Visual Studio code Visual Studio code
03:48 - recognizes that I want to create a c
03:50 - program and it's going to give me the
03:52 - recommendation to install the CN C++
03:55 - extension pack which is the extension
03:59 - developed by by Microsoft if you want
04:01 - you can click on install here if you
04:04 - don't see this kind of uh recommendation
04:06 - you can also go to the extensions
04:09 - section by clicking on this button and
04:11 - then search for C and C++ tools so C C++
04:16 - search for CN C++ so here you will see
04:19 - few result first one is the CN C++ uh uh
04:24 - extension second one is the CN C++
04:27 - extension pack so I will recommend you
04:30 - to download the CN C++ extension pack
04:34 - which comes with CN C++ uh extension CN
04:38 - C++ themes cmake and cmake tools right
04:42 - and this C and C++ extension pack is
04:46 - going to include the C and C++ uh
04:50 - extension this also right so install the
04:53 - second one and it's also from Microsoft
04:57 - so Microsoft is the official official
05:00 - developer of the C and C++ extension
05:02 - pack so it's uh the most popular and
05:06 - most used extension pack for CN C++ so
05:10 - I'm going to click on install here which
05:11 - is going to
05:12 - install all these extensions including
05:15 - CN C++ uh CN C++ themes and cake and
05:20 - cmake tools now I will also recommend to
05:24 - install one more uh extension pack which
05:28 - is called code code Runner so just uh
05:31 - write code Runner here in the search of
05:35 - extensions and then you will see this
05:37 - extension which is called code Runner
05:39 - I'm going to select this code runner
05:40 - from here and then click on install
05:43 - which is going to install this code
05:45 - Runner okay once uh these two extension
05:48 - packs are installed let's go to the
05:50 - Explorer and then let's uh go to our SE
05:53 - file here I'm going to uh paste a very
05:57 - simple C code and what does uh this code
06:00 - do I have declared two uh integers here
06:05 - and num one has the value of five num
06:07 - two I have assigned the value of 10 and
06:09 - I'm just adding these two numbers and
06:11 - printing the values of num one num two
06:14 - and sum in the print statement so this
06:18 - is the very simple C program which you
06:20 - can find anywhere on internet now to run
06:23 - this program here you will be able to
06:26 - see this kind of uh run code button so
06:29 - when I click on this Arrow you have this
06:32 - run code uh uh option so just choose
06:37 - this run code uh option which is going
06:39 - to run your program you can see the
06:41 - output is printed here so this run code
06:45 - option is due to the code Runner and
06:49 - this run C C++ file or debug C++ file is
06:54 - due to the C and C++ extension pack so I
06:58 - will recommend you to all always use
07:00 - this option which says run code okay
07:03 - which is going to run your code in the
07:05 - output section now if you are a fan of
07:09 - uh Terminals and if you want to compile
07:12 - your code using the terminal then first
07:15 - of all to open the terminal click on
07:17 - Terminal and then click on new terminal
07:19 - here and to compile your code you can uh
07:22 - use this command which is
07:26 - cang and when you press Tab Key on your
07:29 - keyboard you will see all the cang
07:32 - related command which you can use uh on
07:34 - your Mac operating system we are going
07:36 - to use the C length command itself
07:38 - because it's a c program and then I'm
07:41 - going to give the name of my C file
07:42 - which is main. C and then I'm going to
07:48 - uh create the output now when I ran the
07:51 - uh main. C file it has created this
07:54 - binary so let me remove this binary
07:56 - because it's the output of the build
07:58 - process when I clicked on this uh run
08:01 - button we are going to create the binary
08:03 - again using the cang command so write
08:06 - cang main. C which is the name of my
08:08 - file hyphen o and then name of your
08:11 - binary output so this time I'm going to
08:15 - name my uh binary file as out which is
08:19 - the compilation output of this C program
08:22 - I'm going to press enter and then it's
08:25 - going to create this kind of out
08:27 - executable file or binary file to run
08:31 - this binary I'm going to just write for
08:34 - for/ out and it's going to print the
08:36 - output so if you are a fan of command
08:38 - line you can also run the code using
08:40 - command line like this now if you want
08:43 - to debug your code then you can go to
08:46 - the debug section here and then you can
08:50 - uh start the debugging of your code so
08:53 - you can click on run and debug and then
08:56 - choose your debugger I'm going to choose
08:58 - the C C length build and debug active
09:01 - file option and then it's going to uh
09:05 - debug your code but first of all we
09:08 - haven't added any breako in our uh files
09:12 - right so it's going to debug but it's
09:14 - not going to stop at any place right so
09:18 - first of all Let's uh set the breako at
09:21 - line number 5 6 9 and 12 and then when I
09:26 - set these break points you can see in
09:29 - the list of break points it has been
09:31 - added so we have added the break point
09:33 - at 5 6 9 and 12 and from here you can
09:36 - also toggle these break points that
09:38 - means disable or enable or remove these
09:41 - break points once again start the
09:43 - debugger and this time hopefully the
09:46 - debugger is going to stop at the first
09:49 - uh break point here you will be able to
09:52 - see the list of all the variables right
09:55 - now num one num two and some have some
09:58 - garbage value because our program
10:01 - execution stopped at this point so we
10:02 - haven't yet executed this line of code
10:05 - so num one have some garbage value num
10:07 - two have garbage value and some have
10:10 - garbage value when I step over so this
10:13 - line of code is executed and now num one
10:16 - has the value of five which is correct
10:18 - when I uh step over once again this line
10:22 - is executed and num two have the value
10:24 - of 10 and when I stop over again this
10:27 - line is executed and some have the value
10:29 - of 15 which is also correct so this is
10:32 - how you can also run your debugger and
10:34 - debug your code and when you press on
10:36 - continue it's going to continue and
10:39 - print the output you can also create the
10:43 - launch. Json file for your debug uh
10:47 - options so when I click on create
10:48 - launch. Json and then click on demo. C
10:52 - which is the name of my
10:54 - folder it's going to create this kind of
10:56 - launch. Json file so when you go to the
10:58 - explor exp you can see vs code uh uh
11:02 - folder is created for you and you will
11:04 - see the launch. Json file created and
11:06 - you will also see that uh your task.
11:10 - Json file is also created by uh Visual
11:13 - Studio code for you in task. Json
11:16 - contains the commands which will be used
11:18 - to build and run your program and you
11:22 - can also see the arguments uh which will
11:25 - be added to your build and run commands
11:28 - and this type of task. Json and launch.
11:33 - Json files are useful when you want to
11:36 - share your code with uh your colleagues
11:38 - so when you commit your code and push
11:40 - your code for example to the GitHub
11:42 - repository and somebody else uh pulls it
11:45 - you will also get the same configuration
11:47 - and use the same configuration to run
11:50 - the C
11:51 - program so I think that's it for uh this
11:54 - video this is how you can compile and
11:56 - run a c program in your Visual Studio
11:58 - code editor on your Mac operating system
12:00 - I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
12:02 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up the C programming development environment on your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system so before setting up the C development environment with our Visual Studio code you need to have the C compiler installed on your Mac operating system which is used to compile your C or C++ programs so first of all for that you need to open open your terminal so just click on this Spotlight and then and then search for the terminal and then open the terminal here and then give this command which is cang and then space hyphen hyen version and then presenter and if it gives you this kind of output which says Apple cang version and the version is listed here and uh you also have this kind of information that means the cang comp compiler is installed on your Mac operating system and you will be able to compile your C programs using cang now if this uh command doesn't give any uh output like this and it gives uh the error and it will say cang is not recognized then you need to install the compiler to install the cang compiler you need to install the xcode development tools there are two ways of installing xcode development tools you can download the xcode from the App Store so just search for xcode in the App Store and download the xcode from here but this xcode package when you download it from the Apple store then it comes with other tools so it comes bundled with different uh sdks and development tools like xcode IDE itself and then the support for or um Mac OS development Swift iOS development and many other tool chains so it's around 7 or 8 GB of data uh you need to download if you want C length just for the C++ development you can also uh give this command on your terminal which is xcode hyphen select space hyphen hyphen install and then press enter and it's going to start the installation of xod on your Mac operating system and it's going to install the cang also when you run this command when I run this command it gives me uh this kind of error which says command line tool is already installed because I have already installed the xcode development tools so it says use the software update to update the xcode otherwise I have already installed the xcode select tool once that's done done just run the cang command once again and then you will see this kind of output once cang compiler is uh installed just open your Visual Studio code and let's open a folder where you want to develop your C code so I'm am going to uh go to my documents folder and here I have this demo C folder I'm going to add this folder in my visual studio code and this folder is right now empty so let's create a C file here so I'm going to click on this plus button here which is going to create a new file and then I'm going to name my file as main. C and then press enter as soon as I uh create a c or C++ file on Visual Studio code Visual Studio code recognizes that I want to create a c program and it's going to give me the recommendation to install the CN C++ extension pack which is the extension developed by by Microsoft if you want you can click on install here if you don't see this kind of uh recommendation you can also go to the extensions section by clicking on this button and then search for C and C++ tools so C C++ search for CN C++ so here you will see few result first one is the CN C++ uh uh extension second one is the CN C++ extension pack so I will recommend you to download the CN C++ extension pack which comes with CN C++ uh extension CN C++ themes cmake and cmake tools right and this C and C++ extension pack is going to include the C and C++ uh extension this also right so install the second one and it's also from Microsoft so Microsoft is the official official developer of the C and C++ extension pack so it's uh the most popular and most used extension pack for CN C++ so I'm going to click on install here which is going to install all these extensions including CN C++ uh CN C++ themes and cake and cmake tools now I will also recommend to install one more uh extension pack which is called code code Runner so just uh write code Runner here in the search of extensions and then you will see this extension which is called code Runner I'm going to select this code runner from here and then click on install which is going to install this code Runner okay once uh these two extension packs are installed let's go to the Explorer and then let's uh go to our SE file here I'm going to uh paste a very simple C code and what does uh this code do I have declared two uh integers here and num one has the value of five num two I have assigned the value of 10 and I'm just adding these two numbers and printing the values of num one num two and sum in the print statement so this is the very simple C program which you can find anywhere on internet now to run this program here you will be able to see this kind of uh run code button so when I click on this Arrow you have this run code uh uh option so just choose this run code uh option which is going to run your program you can see the output is printed here so this run code option is due to the code Runner and this run C C++ file or debug C++ file is due to the C and C++ extension pack so I will recommend you to all always use this option which says run code okay which is going to run your code in the output section now if you are a fan of uh Terminals and if you want to compile your code using the terminal then first of all to open the terminal click on Terminal and then click on new terminal here and to compile your code you can uh use this command which is cang and when you press Tab Key on your keyboard you will see all the cang related command which you can use uh on your Mac operating system we are going to use the C length command itself because it's a c program and then I'm going to give the name of my C file which is main. C and then I'm going to uh create the output now when I ran the uh main. C file it has created this binary so let me remove this binary because it's the output of the build process when I clicked on this uh run button we are going to create the binary again using the cang command so write cang main. C which is the name of my file hyphen o and then name of your binary output so this time I'm going to name my uh binary file as out which is the compilation output of this C program I'm going to press enter and then it's going to create this kind of out executable file or binary file to run this binary I'm going to just write for for/ out and it's going to print the output so if you are a fan of command line you can also run the code using command line like this now if you want to debug your code then you can go to the debug section here and then you can uh start the debugging of your code so you can click on run and debug and then choose your debugger I'm going to choose the C C length build and debug active file option and then it's going to uh debug your code but first of all we haven't added any breako in our uh files right so it's going to debug but it's not going to stop at any place right so first of all Let's uh set the breako at line number 5 6 9 and 12 and then when I set these break points you can see in the list of break points it has been added so we have added the break point at 5 6 9 and 12 and from here you can also toggle these break points that means disable or enable or remove these break points once again start the debugger and this time hopefully the debugger is going to stop at the first uh break point here you will be able to see the list of all the variables right now num one num two and some have some garbage value because our program execution stopped at this point so we haven't yet executed this line of code so num one have some garbage value num two have garbage value and some have garbage value when I step over so this line of code is executed and now num one has the value of five which is correct when I uh step over once again this line is executed and num two have the value of 10 and when I stop over again this line is executed and some have the value of 15 which is also correct so this is how you can also run your debugger and debug your code and when you press on continue it's going to continue and print the output you can also create the launch. Json file for your debug uh options so when I click on create launch. Json and then click on demo. C which is the name of my folder it's going to create this kind of launch. Json file so when you go to the explor exp you can see vs code uh uh folder is created for you and you will see the launch. Json file created and you will also see that uh your task. Json file is also created by uh Visual Studio code for you in task. Json contains the commands which will be used to build and run your program and you can also see the arguments uh which will be added to your build and run commands and this type of task. Json and launch. Json files are useful when you want to share your code with uh your colleagues so when you commit your code and push your code for example to the GitHub repository and somebody else uh pulls it you will also get the same configuration and use the same configuration to run the C program so I think that's it for uh this video this is how you can compile and run a c program in your Visual Studio code editor on your Mac operating system I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
