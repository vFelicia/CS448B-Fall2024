00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:03 - mongodb database tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in the last video we have seen how we
00:07 - can insert the data into the documents
00:10 - in mongodb now in this video we will see
00:13 - how we can query the data from the
00:16 - documents using mongod DB so in the last
00:20 - video if you remember we have created a
00:22 - database called school which we are
00:25 - going to use in this video also so just
00:28 - use School and then to query all the
00:32 - documents from a collection which we
00:35 - have created in the last video inside
00:37 - school which was student what we can do
00:40 - is we can just write DB do the
00:42 - collection name which is student in our
00:44 - case and then just write find and then
00:47 - give these two uh brackets something
00:51 - like this okay and then execute this and
00:56 - it gives all the data which we have
00:59 - inserted
01:00 - into this student collection which is
01:04 - these documents right now if you can see
01:08 - here uh this is the dump of the results
01:13 - and it's not prettified or it's not
01:16 - shown in a pretty way so to show this
01:19 - data in a pretty way we have a command
01:22 - called pretty so just write dot pretty
01:26 - okay and when you give this command
01:29 - after this F find and execute it you
01:32 - will uh see this uh data in a prettified
01:37 - form or in uh you know just like Json
01:41 - format right and if You observe uh this
01:45 - data which is given by this mongod DB
01:49 - query you can see this data and if you
01:52 - remember last time we have inserted uh
01:54 - these elements called student uh number
01:57 - first name last name and age but there
02:01 - is a extra field here added to our
02:06 - output which is ID right so this is
02:10 - because whenever we insert a document in
02:13 - mongodb it creates a unique ID for every
02:19 - you know document so that on the basis
02:21 - of this we can query uh our data because
02:25 - this is the unique uh ID for your
02:28 - document now if you if you give this ID
02:32 - by yourself for example you give this ID
02:35 - is equal to one or two or any other ID
02:38 - then it's going to uh show you this ID
02:41 - otherwise mongodb is going to create uh
02:44 - ID by itself for you which is shown to
02:47 - you here
02:50 - okay now whenever you uh you know query
02:54 - the database there can be uh some
02:57 - condition on the basis of those
02:58 - condition you want to query the data for
03:01 - example uh I want to query the data only
03:04 - for student one okay now the first way
03:10 - of uh you know querying the first
03:13 - document from your document list is just
03:17 - go here and just write DB do students
03:22 - and then dot
03:25 - find and then you have this option
03:28 - called find one okay and this option is
03:32 - going to give you the first document so
03:35 - when we uh execute this query it gives
03:39 - the first document which was inserted in
03:42 - this database
03:44 - okay now there are some condition on the
03:47 - basis of which you want to query the
03:49 - database for example you want to query
03:52 - the database on the basis of age or for
03:57 - example we want to query the database on
03:59 - the basis of student number and we want
04:02 - the data of the student whose number is
04:06 - uh two for example so what we can do is
04:09 - we can just uh write on the next line
04:12 - db.
04:14 - student. find once again and then give
04:18 - these two round brackets and inside
04:20 - these two round brackets just give these
04:24 - curly brackets and then give the you
04:28 - know whatever element you want to qu
04:31 - query okay so for example I want to just
04:34 - query the student number inside these
04:36 - curly brackets I will just write in
04:39 - double quotes student number and then is
04:43 - equal to two or colon 2 and keep in mind
04:48 - we need to give double quotes here
04:50 - because here also we have given the
04:52 - double quotes right and then just select
04:55 - all the command and execute it and now
04:59 - it gives the data for student to you can
05:03 - see here okay now for example you want
05:06 - to uh query the datab base on the basis
05:10 - of uh age and we want the list of all
05:13 - the document which is uh greater than
05:17 - for example 16y old okay so we can just
05:22 - write instead of this we can write age
05:26 - here and then we can uh just write in
05:31 - the curly braces so just write these
05:33 - curly braces and then give this uh
05:37 - dollar symbol and then you just need to
05:40 - write GT for greater than okay and then
05:45 - give this colon here and then give uh
05:48 - the number or the age which you want to
05:52 - write here okay so for example we want
05:54 - all the student which is greater than uh
05:58 - 15 years old okay and then we can just
06:02 - uh execute this command and you can see
06:04 - all the data age is more than 15 here
06:09 - okay and there is one more command for
06:12 - example you want to uh show the student
06:15 - who are more than 15 including 15 so
06:20 - greater than or equal to so you just
06:23 - write GT and just include letter e here
06:27 - which stand for equality so it will show
06:29 - you the data which is greater than or
06:32 - equal to 15 so let's uh execute this
06:35 - command and you can see 15 is included
06:39 - here in the same way we have less than
06:42 - command so instead of GT e we can just
06:46 - write LT Which is less than okay and
06:51 - let's execute this
06:53 - command and it gives a result uh all the
06:57 - Ages which is less than 15 so 13 12 and
07:01 - 10 and in the same way as greater than
07:04 - you can just add letter e here which
07:07 - includes the equality for this command
07:10 - so whenever we execute this command it
07:14 - gives or it includes the 15 uh year old
07:18 - student also because it's equal to less
07:21 - than or equal to okay now there is one
07:25 - last command which is there which is
07:28 - called not equal to and for that you
07:31 - just need to write NE here so NE stand
07:35 - for not equals okay so it will give uh
07:38 - the data for all the student which is
07:41 - not equal to uh 15y old okay so just
07:45 - execute this command and it gives all
07:48 - the ages except 15 okay and for example
07:52 - you want to prettify this uh result once
07:55 - again you can just write here pretty
07:58 - okay so you can just
08:00 - add this command or add this uh function
08:02 - here and then execute this uh command
08:06 - once again and it gives you the result
08:09 - in a pretty fine way so in this way you
08:13 - can uh query your documents uh there are
08:16 - more ways of querying your documents
08:19 - which I will uh show you in the next
08:20 - video so please wait comment and
08:22 - subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on mongodb database tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can insert the data into the documents in mongodb now in this video we will see how we can query the data from the documents using mongod DB so in the last video if you remember we have created a database called school which we are going to use in this video also so just use School and then to query all the documents from a collection which we have created in the last video inside school which was student what we can do is we can just write DB do the collection name which is student in our case and then just write find and then give these two uh brackets something like this okay and then execute this and it gives all the data which we have inserted into this student collection which is these documents right now if you can see here uh this is the dump of the results and it's not prettified or it's not shown in a pretty way so to show this data in a pretty way we have a command called pretty so just write dot pretty okay and when you give this command after this F find and execute it you will uh see this uh data in a prettified form or in uh you know just like Json format right and if You observe uh this data which is given by this mongod DB query you can see this data and if you remember last time we have inserted uh these elements called student uh number first name last name and age but there is a extra field here added to our output which is ID right so this is because whenever we insert a document in mongodb it creates a unique ID for every you know document so that on the basis of this we can query uh our data because this is the unique uh ID for your document now if you if you give this ID by yourself for example you give this ID is equal to one or two or any other ID then it's going to uh show you this ID otherwise mongodb is going to create uh ID by itself for you which is shown to you here okay now whenever you uh you know query the database there can be uh some condition on the basis of those condition you want to query the data for example uh I want to query the data only for student one okay now the first way of uh you know querying the first document from your document list is just go here and just write DB do students and then dot find and then you have this option called find one okay and this option is going to give you the first document so when we uh execute this query it gives the first document which was inserted in this database okay now there are some condition on the basis of which you want to query the database for example you want to query the database on the basis of age or for example we want to query the database on the basis of student number and we want the data of the student whose number is uh two for example so what we can do is we can just uh write on the next line db. student. find once again and then give these two round brackets and inside these two round brackets just give these curly brackets and then give the you know whatever element you want to qu query okay so for example I want to just query the student number inside these curly brackets I will just write in double quotes student number and then is equal to two or colon 2 and keep in mind we need to give double quotes here because here also we have given the double quotes right and then just select all the command and execute it and now it gives the data for student to you can see here okay now for example you want to uh query the datab base on the basis of uh age and we want the list of all the document which is uh greater than for example 16y old okay so we can just write instead of this we can write age here and then we can uh just write in the curly braces so just write these curly braces and then give this uh dollar symbol and then you just need to write GT for greater than okay and then give this colon here and then give uh the number or the age which you want to write here okay so for example we want all the student which is greater than uh 15 years old okay and then we can just uh execute this command and you can see all the data age is more than 15 here okay and there is one more command for example you want to uh show the student who are more than 15 including 15 so greater than or equal to so you just write GT and just include letter e here which stand for equality so it will show you the data which is greater than or equal to 15 so let's uh execute this command and you can see 15 is included here in the same way we have less than command so instead of GT e we can just write LT Which is less than okay and let's execute this command and it gives a result uh all the Ages which is less than 15 so 13 12 and 10 and in the same way as greater than you can just add letter e here which includes the equality for this command so whenever we execute this command it gives or it includes the 15 uh year old student also because it's equal to less than or equal to okay now there is one last command which is there which is called not equal to and for that you just need to write NE here so NE stand for not equals okay so it will give uh the data for all the student which is not equal to uh 15y old okay so just execute this command and it gives all the ages except 15 okay and for example you want to prettify this uh result once again you can just write here pretty okay so you can just add this command or add this uh function here and then execute this uh command once again and it gives you the result in a pretty fine way so in this way you can uh query your documents uh there are more ways of querying your documents which I will uh show you in the next video so please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
