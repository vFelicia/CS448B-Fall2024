00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can convert your
00:04 - responsive website into an Android app
00:08 - it's not really complicated I'm going to
00:10 - use Android Studio for that and let's
00:13 - see how we can do it so first of all uh
00:16 - the prerequisite is you need to have a
00:18 - website of course and it should be a
00:20 - responsive website and what do I mean by
00:24 - responsive website is like this so
00:27 - whenever it's opened in the mobile view
00:30 - like this it's kind of a mobile view it
00:33 - should you know be mobile friendly right
00:37 - so you can see the menu uh you know
00:40 - contracts according to the mobile view
00:43 - and then you can browse to the menu like
00:47 - this okay and when I click something you
00:52 - can see this okay so this is my website
00:55 - which I want to convert to an Android
00:58 - app which is easy online converter if
01:00 - you want you can visit this website for
01:03 - converting uh many values to another
01:07 - values and now let's see how we can uh
01:10 - convert this website into an Android app
01:13 - so first of all open your Android Studio
01:17 - if you don't know how you can download
01:18 - and install Android Studio I will paste
01:21 - a link of a video in which I have shown
01:23 - you how you can download and install uh
01:25 - Android Studio on your Windows operating
01:28 - system so open your Android studio and
01:31 - uh create a new Android project and in
01:34 - here give the name to your project I'm
01:36 - going to name it as easy online
01:39 - converter and I'm going to click next
01:42 - and uh right now leave everything as a
01:45 - default you can choose
01:48 - the last one or latest version but uh it
01:52 - may be uh not compatible with all the
01:56 - you know devices so I prefer to use for
01:59 - now 4.1 Jelly Bean which covers
02:04 - 73% or 78% of devices Okay now click
02:10 - next and choose the blank Activity Click
02:14 - next and uh leave everything as default
02:18 - if you want you can change the name of
02:19 - your main activity but I don't want this
02:22 - so I will click finish
02:24 - now so now our project is created and
02:27 - the first thing we are going to do is we
02:29 - are going to remove this uh hello world
02:32 - uh component from here and then what we
02:35 - are going to do is in the pallet section
02:38 - here we will search for the web view so
02:41 - search for web View and drag and drop
02:43 - into your activity here okay and now
02:47 - what we are going to do next is we will
02:50 - just select our web View and go to the
02:53 - properties here and we will just choose
02:56 - fill parent and the height also so
02:59 - layout height also fill parent okay and
03:04 - you can just resize it like this now
03:07 - next step is to go to your uh Java
03:11 - folder here and open your main activity.
03:14 - Java and in here first of all we are
03:17 - going to declare a web view uh variable
03:21 - so just
03:22 - write private web view so just search
03:26 - for web View and give a name to it for
03:30 - example web view okay and now once you
03:35 - have created your variable just copy
03:37 - your variable and go to your uh oncreate
03:40 - method here and just here just paste
03:43 - your web View and then we are going to
03:46 - call this web view by uh you know
03:49 - casting it so what we need to do just
03:52 - give a bracket here and then just write
03:55 - web View and then out outside the
03:58 - bracket just write find view by ID so it
04:02 - will find your uh component using your
04:06 - ID and then just write r. ID do your web
04:11 - view ID which is web view in our case
04:14 - now here you may be confused because
04:16 - your component ID is also web View and
04:20 - uh your uh private variable is also web
04:23 - view with the same spelling so for
04:26 - example I can uh change it to my web
04:28 - view so that it will be clear which is
04:31 - what okay so just do it here now the
04:34 - second step is uh just uh create a
04:38 - variable one more variable which is web
04:41 - view settings and just uh name it as web
04:45 - view settings is equal to then just take
04:48 - your my web View and then call a method
04:52 - called get settings here the next step
04:55 - is to take your web settings from here
04:59 - and then
05:00 - call a method called set JavaScript
05:02 - enabled is equal to true and what it's
05:05 - going to do is it's going to enable the
05:08 - JavaScript uh in your uh you know web
05:11 - view so whenever you use a website which
05:14 - is using JavaScript it's going to you
05:17 - know support this
05:20 - okay now next step is to take your uh
05:25 - web view variable which is my web view
05:27 - in my case and then call a method called
05:30 - load URL and in the double codes give
05:33 - the URL for your website so I will just
05:36 - copy the URL of my website from here and
05:40 - paste it in these uh double codes okay
05:43 - now whenever you are using web view in
05:46 - order to uh give your device the
05:49 - permission to use internet you need to
05:52 - uh change the Manifest file from here so
05:55 - go to the Manifest folder and open
05:57 - Android manifest. EX ml file from here
06:01 - and in here at the top you can create
06:03 - one more element here and you can uh use
06:07 - this users permission attribute here and
06:11 - then you just need to choose the
06:14 - permission which we want to allow so in
06:17 - our case we want to choose uh Android
06:20 - permission for internet so just uh
06:23 - search for this which is this one
06:24 - Android permission internet and then
06:27 - close your element like this now once
06:31 - everything is done we are going to test
06:34 - our app so just click this green button
06:36 - here and then it's going to run our app
06:40 - in the emulator provided by Android
06:43 - Studio to us so now our app is running
06:46 - on the emulator and uh you can see this
06:49 - website uh it's looking same as we have
06:52 - seen on the browser right now for
06:54 - example I will click one button here
06:58 - what it happens let's see see so I'm
07:00 - going to just click this uh check some
07:03 - calculator for example and let's see
07:05 - what happens when we do this so what
07:08 - happened is it's going to open this URL
07:12 - in the browser and this we don't want we
07:15 - want that uh whenever we uh you know
07:18 - click some uh you know option here it
07:22 - should be opened in your app itself
07:25 - right so we are going to correct this
07:26 - thing in a moment the second thing we
07:29 - want to add the functionality for the
07:32 - back button right so whenever we want to
07:35 - browse the P Pages uh forward on bwart
07:39 - then we want to uh you know add the
07:42 - functionality for that and the last
07:44 - thing uh you may observe here is the
07:48 - padding around your app so you can see
07:51 - little bit of margin is left here around
07:55 - your app which also we are going to
07:57 - remove let's see how we can do these
08:00 - things so to solve the first problem uh
08:04 - we are going to go to once again to our
08:06 - main activity do Java file and in here
08:10 - we will take our my web view
08:13 - variable and then we will call a method
08:17 - called set web view client and then we
08:20 - will just call new web view client okay
08:24 - and what this line of code will do is
08:27 - it's going to prevent uh your uh you
08:30 - know URLs to open in the browser so
08:33 - whenever your uh you know app is open
08:35 - and when you click some link it's not
08:37 - going to open this link in the web
08:39 - browser okay so this line is for that
08:42 - I'm going to minimize this thing so you
08:44 - can see better now to add uh the back
08:48 - button functionality there is a
08:51 - predefined method here which we can call
08:54 - which is called on back press so just
08:58 - write on and and it's going to show you
09:00 - this intelligence just press and select
09:03 - on back press and this is going to add
09:06 - this method here now whenever the back
09:09 - button is pressed and we are browsing
09:12 - our website we want that we will uh you
09:14 - know go to the last page we have browsed
09:17 - so we will add a condition here and this
09:21 - condition is just take your my web view
09:24 - first of all and then we will first of
09:27 - all check if we can go go back so there
09:30 - is a method called can go back and it
09:34 - replies a Boolean value so if in the app
09:37 - you can go back then it's going to
09:40 - return true and in this case what we
09:43 - will do we will go back so just take
09:45 - your uh my web view uh object and then
09:49 - call a method called go back so if you
09:52 - can go back you will go back else uh you
09:56 - will exit the app so just write else and
10:00 - this line will be inside this else
10:03 - condition if you want you can add these
10:06 - bracket but for one line you don't
10:09 - require but let's add it for the sanity
10:13 - so this is for the back button
10:17 - functionality now the third thing was
10:20 - the padding extra padding if you want to
10:22 - remove this extra padding from here then
10:25 - go to your activity _ main.xml
10:29 - file and in here in the top there are
10:33 - some properties related to these padding
10:37 - you can see here this padding left
10:40 - padding right padding top and padding
10:43 - bottom so these are the attribute which
10:47 - are responsible for adding the padding
10:49 - around your app but in our case we don't
10:53 - want this padding so we can remove these
10:56 - four attributes padding bottom padding
10:58 - top padding right and padding left and
11:01 - don't remove anything else so just
11:03 - remove these things and then save your
11:06 - code and then we are going to once again
11:09 - run our app okay so let's see what
11:12 - happens when we run our app so app is
11:16 - once again running and uh let's click on
11:19 - some of the button or some of the links
11:22 - here for example this uh case converter
11:26 - and when I click on this case converter
11:29 - this time it's going to open inside the
11:31 - app this uh link you can see it has
11:34 - opened this uh link inside your app it
11:37 - doesn't go to the browser to open this
11:40 - link here and let's browse some more
11:43 - links here and we will check the back
11:45 - button functionality after that so I'm
11:48 - going to click this checkum link and it
11:51 - opens this checkum and once again I'm
11:55 - going to open for example uh this
11:57 - decimal binary hack converter from here
12:00 - and it's opening this uh URL right
12:04 - inside your app and when I press this
12:07 - back button from here it will go back to
12:11 - the last browsed page and once again go
12:15 - back and once again go
12:19 - back and then we are in the main
12:22 - homepage of our app and now this time
12:24 - when you uh click this back button it's
12:26 - going to you know close this app right
12:30 - so in this way you can uh you know
12:33 - convert your website into uh Android app
12:37 - now the thing which is remaining is you
12:40 - need to just create a APK file of uh
12:43 - this app and then upload it on Google
12:46 - Play or any other App Store so I hope
12:49 - you have enjoyed this video please R
12:50 - comment subscribe and bye for now
