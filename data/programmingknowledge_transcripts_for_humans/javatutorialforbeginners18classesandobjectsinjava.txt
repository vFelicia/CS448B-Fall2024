00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners till now we have seen the
00:07 - procedural part of java now from this
00:11 - video we will see some of the
00:13 - objectoriented uh aspects of java uh and
00:18 - first of all we will see what are
00:20 - classes and how we can declare classes
00:23 - in Java and how we can use classes in
00:28 - Java so first of all what is a
00:31 - class you may have noticed that whenever
00:34 - we have created our first program it
00:38 - was a class and inside this class we
00:42 - were calling this main method so every
00:45 - Java project has at least one class and
00:49 - one main method and class is basically a
00:53 - data structure or type inside which you
00:57 - can Define some
01:00 - variables which are called member
01:02 - variables and methods which are called
01:06 - member
01:07 - methods and the most uh important
01:11 - property of classes are you can create
01:15 - instance or object from class so you can
01:18 - maintain different states of a class
01:22 - using these instances or
01:25 - objects so let's see how we can uh
01:28 - define a class which will will be a new
01:30 - class and how we can use it with our
01:35 - main class which is my class so for
01:39 - example we want to uh make some student
01:43 - uh data structure and uh for that we
01:47 - will make a class so just go to your
01:50 - project if you are using eclipse and go
01:54 - to the package you have made we have
01:56 - made a lesson one package uh at the
01:58 - starting of uh this video series go to
02:01 - that package inside which you will be
02:05 - having a class my class in my case just
02:09 - go to the package right click the same
02:12 - package and go to new and create a new
02:16 - class and this class name we will name
02:20 - it
02:21 - as
02:24 - student okay and leave everything as
02:28 - default and click finish and now we have
02:33 - this student class inside our lesson one
02:37 - package so we have two classes now my
02:39 - class is the first class which we were
02:42 - working on and the second class is
02:44 - called student. Java and this is the
02:47 - second class uh we have created now now
02:51 - this class can have its member variables
02:56 - and methods so for example what can be
03:00 - the traits of the student student can
03:02 - have his ID so ID is integer value so I
03:08 - declare a variable called ID student can
03:12 - have name so I declare a variable called
03:16 - name and student can
03:19 - have age his age so I declare student
03:24 - age okay so this is basically you have
03:28 - created a class and it can have member
03:31 - variables it can also have member
03:34 - methods uh that we will see in a moment
03:38 - but let's consider this is a basic
03:40 - student class which contains three
03:42 - variables ID and name and age okay now
03:48 - to call this class in
03:51 - your main method in my my class you can
03:56 - just create an instance of or object of
03:59 - the the class so how you can do it you
04:02 - can just call the same name student
04:05 - class name just copy this name here and
04:09 - then give the name to your instance so
04:15 - as we have we give any name to our
04:17 - variables for example age name or
04:20 - something here also you can give uh the
04:23 - name to the students variable okay so
04:27 - for example the name
04:30 - is Mark we are making the data structure
04:34 - for Mark is equal to
04:38 - [Music]
04:40 - new student okay and this basically we
04:45 - have created an instance
04:48 - of student class which we name as Mark
04:53 - so this is uh Mark instance so Mark
04:57 - here mark
05:00 - here is
05:03 - called
05:05 - object okay or some people also call it
05:09 - as
05:12 - instance okay
05:16 - instance so Mark is here called object
05:19 - or instance and this object we can use
05:22 - to you know assign values to the member
05:26 - variables of this student class for
05:28 - example Mark's ID is uh so whenever you
05:33 - call this instance called Mark and
05:36 - whenever you use this dot separator
05:39 - it'll give you the options which is um
05:43 - provided by Eclipse to you so the
05:46 - student class contain age ID and name so
05:49 - we will choose ID student ID is equal to
05:54 - for example uh one Mark is our first
05:58 - student and and in the same way you can
06:02 - call Mark dot
06:07 - name should be Mark do
06:11 - name is equal to name is Mark we already
06:16 - know and the age so Mark
06:22 - dot
06:23 - age is equal to and he is 15 year old
06:27 - for example
06:32 - so what we have done is we have created
06:34 - an instance of uh student class and we
06:36 - name it as Mark and then to this
06:39 - instance we have created or we have
06:42 - assigned some values and these values we
06:45 - can you know access these values with
06:49 - the same names mark. ID mark. name and
06:51 - mark. age so you can just write CIS o
06:56 - control shift and then you can just
07:01 - write
07:06 - Mark do
07:10 - name is so you use Plus or concatination
07:16 - operator
07:17 - is and then plus and then mark. AG so we
07:22 - will print Mark is uh whatever his age
07:26 - is years old okay
07:31 - years
07:32 - old okay and when we run this
07:36 - program it'll print Mark is 15 years old
07:41 - okay in a similar way we can create
07:45 - different instances of our classes and
07:50 - so what we can do is we I will just copy
07:53 - the same uh Mark uh student class and we
07:57 - will create a new object called this
08:00 - time we call it Tom okay so here Tom is
08:05 - the second instance of the student class
08:08 - okay and his ID is two name is Tom
08:14 - itself
08:16 - and the age is for example 14 okay so in
08:24 - here we can once again
08:27 - make the copy of this print line method
08:31 - and this time we will just replace Mark
08:35 - by
08:36 - Tom and now you can see it prints Tom is
08:42 - 14 years old and is there something
08:47 - wrong here yeah here we haven't changed
08:50 - this instance name here okay once again
08:54 - we will run the
08:55 - program and it says Mark is 15y old and
08:59 - Tom is 14 years old okay so using a
09:05 - class we can Define different object and
09:08 - we can Define uh these object values of
09:14 - object member variable
09:16 - values which are independent of each
09:19 - other so this instance values which are
09:22 - ID Tom's ID Tom's name and Tom's age is
09:26 - independent of Mark's ID Mark's name and
09:29 - max age okay so this is very uh
09:33 - important property of object that it can
09:36 - store its own State and it's independent
09:39 - of uh the other instance
09:43 - right now in uh you know in Java
09:49 - programming or programming in general uh
09:52 - we never use or this kind of usage
09:57 - direct usage of variabl
09:59 - are discouraged and why it's discouraged
10:03 - because uh any other person or whoever
10:07 - is uh whoever is using your code can
10:10 - modify these values so we
10:14 - use some uh you know some methods or
10:19 - some functions which can get or set
10:23 - these values okay so what I mean by
10:27 - getting and setting these Valu
10:30 - is
10:32 - uh I can go to this uh class called
10:36 - student and in here I can
10:39 - just use I can just go to the source Tab
10:45 - and in here I can go
10:50 - to so we will go to the source and just
10:54 - go to generate Getters and Setters here
10:58 - and here we can see operation is not
11:01 - applicable in current class
11:04 - okay and in here we will just use this
11:09 - and click once again Getters and Setters
11:13 - so just click one variable name or
11:17 - variable then only this will work so go
11:20 - to Source once again and create gets and
11:23 - Setters and in here select all so we are
11:27 - basically uh
11:29 - making getter and Setter method for
11:32 - every value because we don't want to use
11:35 - or we don't want to access these
11:38 - variable directly we just create gets
11:41 - and sets for all of them and whenever we
11:45 - click okay you can see here Java has
11:48 - created us these Cs and Setters for all
11:52 - these values okay and what this is
11:57 - basically doing is it has we whenever we
12:01 - want to you know assign some value to
12:04 - the ID we will use set ID method and
12:09 - whenever we want to get the value of ID
12:12 - we will use get method and this is
12:15 - called
12:16 - encapsulation of a variable and this is
12:19 - important because we don't want to give
12:22 - access to our variables to some other
12:25 - user which is unknown to us right and so
12:32 - now what we are going to do is we have
12:36 - generated these Getters and Setters in
12:38 - between our variables so we can just cut
12:42 - these values
12:45 - and paste it here and these Getters and
12:50 - sets we have generated for all the
12:52 - values
12:54 - right so now when we want to assign some
12:58 - values to the mark instance instead of
13:01 - this mark. ID we will just use
13:07 - Mark dot set ID
13:11 - or set ID and then we can give any ID to
13:16 - to Mark and this value assignment is we
13:21 - are not going to use in the same way we
13:23 - will use marks dot
13:26 - set name and this name we will give to
13:35 - Mark and in the same way we will assign
13:39 - age to Mark so Mark do set age okay age
13:45 - is
13:47 - 15 right and in the same way we will do
13:52 - something with uh Tom's instance also so
13:56 - tom. set ID Tom do set
14:00 - name so Tom
14:05 - dot set
14:08 - name we will assign this name to
14:11 - Tom and tom. set age same thing
14:20 - here so basically what we have done we
14:24 - have used instead of direct assignment
14:28 - we assigned ing values using these
14:30 - Getters and Setters and this protects
14:32 - your data from corrupting if you
14:35 - somebody wants to corrupt your data or
14:37 - something like this okay and to get
14:41 - these value you just call Mark do get
14:48 - name and Mark
14:52 - dot get
14:54 - age okay and same we will do with our
14:59 - Tom
15:02 - instance and whenever we run the program
15:04 - result will be same but this is more
15:08 - preferred while you are accessing or
15:11 - assigning the values to the member
15:15 - variables so this is how classes uh
15:19 - Works in Java there are more uh things
15:22 - to you know classes which we will
15:25 - discuss in further videos but but that's
15:27 - it for this video please wait comment
15:29 - and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners till now we have seen the procedural part of java now from this video we will see some of the objectoriented uh aspects of java uh and first of all we will see what are classes and how we can declare classes in Java and how we can use classes in Java so first of all what is a class you may have noticed that whenever we have created our first program it was a class and inside this class we were calling this main method so every Java project has at least one class and one main method and class is basically a data structure or type inside which you can Define some variables which are called member variables and methods which are called member methods and the most uh important property of classes are you can create instance or object from class so you can maintain different states of a class using these instances or objects so let's see how we can uh define a class which will will be a new class and how we can use it with our main class which is my class so for example we want to uh make some student uh data structure and uh for that we will make a class so just go to your project if you are using eclipse and go to the package you have made we have made a lesson one package uh at the starting of uh this video series go to that package inside which you will be having a class my class in my case just go to the package right click the same package and go to new and create a new class and this class name we will name it as student okay and leave everything as default and click finish and now we have this student class inside our lesson one package so we have two classes now my class is the first class which we were working on and the second class is called student. Java and this is the second class uh we have created now now this class can have its member variables and methods so for example what can be the traits of the student student can have his ID so ID is integer value so I declare a variable called ID student can have name so I declare a variable called name and student can have age his age so I declare student age okay so this is basically you have created a class and it can have member variables it can also have member methods uh that we will see in a moment but let's consider this is a basic student class which contains three variables ID and name and age okay now to call this class in your main method in my my class you can just create an instance of or object of the the class so how you can do it you can just call the same name student class name just copy this name here and then give the name to your instance so as we have we give any name to our variables for example age name or something here also you can give uh the name to the students variable okay so for example the name is Mark we are making the data structure for Mark is equal to new student okay and this basically we have created an instance of student class which we name as Mark so this is uh Mark instance so Mark here mark here is called object okay or some people also call it as instance okay instance so Mark is here called object or instance and this object we can use to you know assign values to the member variables of this student class for example Mark's ID is uh so whenever you call this instance called Mark and whenever you use this dot separator it'll give you the options which is um provided by Eclipse to you so the student class contain age ID and name so we will choose ID student ID is equal to for example uh one Mark is our first student and and in the same way you can call Mark dot name should be Mark do name is equal to name is Mark we already know and the age so Mark dot age is equal to and he is 15 year old for example so what we have done is we have created an instance of uh student class and we name it as Mark and then to this instance we have created or we have assigned some values and these values we can you know access these values with the same names mark. ID mark. name and mark. age so you can just write CIS o control shift and then you can just write Mark do name is so you use Plus or concatination operator is and then plus and then mark. AG so we will print Mark is uh whatever his age is years old okay years old okay and when we run this program it'll print Mark is 15 years old okay in a similar way we can create different instances of our classes and so what we can do is we I will just copy the same uh Mark uh student class and we will create a new object called this time we call it Tom okay so here Tom is the second instance of the student class okay and his ID is two name is Tom itself and the age is for example 14 okay so in here we can once again make the copy of this print line method and this time we will just replace Mark by Tom and now you can see it prints Tom is 14 years old and is there something wrong here yeah here we haven't changed this instance name here okay once again we will run the program and it says Mark is 15y old and Tom is 14 years old okay so using a class we can Define different object and we can Define uh these object values of object member variable values which are independent of each other so this instance values which are ID Tom's ID Tom's name and Tom's age is independent of Mark's ID Mark's name and max age okay so this is very uh important property of object that it can store its own State and it's independent of uh the other instance right now in uh you know in Java programming or programming in general uh we never use or this kind of usage direct usage of variabl are discouraged and why it's discouraged because uh any other person or whoever is uh whoever is using your code can modify these values so we use some uh you know some methods or some functions which can get or set these values okay so what I mean by getting and setting these Valu is uh I can go to this uh class called student and in here I can just use I can just go to the source Tab and in here I can go to so we will go to the source and just go to generate Getters and Setters here and here we can see operation is not applicable in current class okay and in here we will just use this and click once again Getters and Setters so just click one variable name or variable then only this will work so go to Source once again and create gets and Setters and in here select all so we are basically uh making getter and Setter method for every value because we don't want to use or we don't want to access these variable directly we just create gets and sets for all of them and whenever we click okay you can see here Java has created us these Cs and Setters for all these values okay and what this is basically doing is it has we whenever we want to you know assign some value to the ID we will use set ID method and whenever we want to get the value of ID we will use get method and this is called encapsulation of a variable and this is important because we don't want to give access to our variables to some other user which is unknown to us right and so now what we are going to do is we have generated these Getters and Setters in between our variables so we can just cut these values and paste it here and these Getters and sets we have generated for all the values right so now when we want to assign some values to the mark instance instead of this mark.
