00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - register total for beginners and in this
00:04 - video we will learn how we can use
00:06 - sorted sets in Redis so first of all
00:10 - what are sorted sets so ready sorted
00:13 - sets are similar to the Redis sets with
00:17 - a unique feature that their members can
00:20 - be sorted now every member of a sorted
00:24 - set is associated with a score and based
00:29 - on the score their members can be sorted
00:32 - right so you can see in this diagram the
00:36 - Redis key will remain the same as other
00:39 - patterns but here you can see a score
00:44 - here so you can define a score for
00:47 - example I will define a score 100 and
00:50 - then the value associated with the score
00:52 - so the value associated with the score
00:54 - is value do
00:57 - and this is our member of a set and
00:59 - there is a new feature in the sorted set
01:02 - which is this score right so you can
01:06 - define a score and with the score you
01:09 - can define a member or a value
01:12 - associated with it and then on the basis
01:15 - of that we can sort the members of our
01:18 - set right so let's see in practical how
01:23 - it works
01:23 - so I'm going to open my Redis CLI so the
01:27 - first command we are going to learn here
01:29 - is that ad and the said ad is used to
01:33 - create a set if it does not exist or add
01:37 - a member to this set if it already
01:41 - exists right so every command in sorted
01:46 - set will start with this character Z and
01:49 - then whatever its function is the
01:52 - function name for example right so that
01:55 - ad and then the key name for example my
01:58 - set 1 and the score so score is 1 and
02:02 - the value associated with it so squarely
02:05 - for example you want to associate it
02:07 - with the school 1 is a write in a
02:11 - similar way we can define multiple
02:13 - school
02:13 - or members here so score and the value
02:16 - associated whether two and B for example
02:19 - 3 is the third score and the value we
02:22 - want to associate with it is C and then
02:26 - they need not be in order so score can
02:29 - be 5 now and the value can be D here
02:33 - right or any other value right and then
02:36 - press ENTER and you can see four numbers
02:40 - are inserted in the sorted set now to
02:44 - get the members of a sorted set you use
02:48 - Z and then range command okay as we have
02:52 - seen in the sets also and then what is
02:56 - your key name for example my set 1 and
03:00 - then starting value and the end value as
03:03 - we have seen in the case of sets also so
03:07 - in the case of sets we have seen that 0
03:09 - and -1 are going to give all the values
03:13 - in the set right so press ENTER and you
03:16 - can see here all the values are printed
03:20 - here now you can see here the values are
03:24 - printed not the you know scores
03:27 - associated with them right so for
03:30 - example I once again write that add and
03:35 - then set 1 nice add 1 and then for
03:39 - example I can just give score 100 here
03:41 - and then the value is here right and
03:45 - then press ENTER and once again I will
03:48 - just give that range my set 1 and then
03:52 - you can see all the venues here or all
03:54 - the members here but these are not the
03:57 - schools these are just order ordered
04:01 - number now if you want to know how many
04:04 - number of members are there in our set
04:07 - you can use that card here okay
04:10 - and the key name for example my set 1
04:13 - and then press enter and I can see that
04:16 - there are 5 members in my sorted set
04:19 - right now in order to get the count of
04:22 - members in the sorted set with the
04:25 - scores
04:26 - in the given range we use LED count okay
04:30 - and then the key name so my set
04:34 - one and the minimum and the maximum are
04:38 - score value here so for example I want
04:40 - to get one two three here okay and then
04:45 - press ENTER and then it is going to
04:47 - count the number of values between this
04:50 - range right so for example I will just
04:53 - write 1 2 5 here and values are 4
04:58 - because in between school 1 and score 5
05:01 - there are 4 values including those
05:05 - scores now I can just write 1 250 here
05:09 - or 55 and still it's going to give us 4
05:12 - values number of values because the last
05:15 - score we have associated here is 100 so
05:18 - when we write here 1 0 1 here and then
05:22 - press ENTER then only it's going to give
05:25 - us 5 values and let's say we can give 99
05:29 - here still it gives the 4 value so the
05:34 - said count is going to take the score
05:37 - values and then depending upon the score
05:40 - values is going to give you the number
05:42 - of values in between these scores now
05:46 - let me clear the terminal and to remove
05:51 - any member from a set you use read REM
05:57 - and then the key name my set and member
06:01 - so the member here will be the member
06:05 - value so not the score but the member so
06:09 - for example I want to remove the member
06:11 - B so I can just give the value of member
06:15 - of B and then press ENTER and once again
06:18 - I will just give this said range command
06:22 - and now it's giving the same answer
06:24 - because I haven't given the right key
06:27 - name so I must give that M my set 1 here
06:32 - right and then it gives integer 1 that
06:36 - means the command is successful and once
06:38 - again the range and
06:40 - now you can see the value is removed
06:42 - from here now if you want to determine
06:44 - the index of a member in a sorted set
06:46 - you use that rank here so just give
06:50 - reside rank amount and then my set 1 and
06:53 - the member name so for example D here
06:57 - and then press ENTER and it's going to
06:59 - give you the index of this D right so
07:05 - the index starts from 0 so 0 1 2 right
07:09 - for example I want to see the index of
07:12 - ye here is going to give me the index 3
07:16 - and for example for member a the index
07:19 - is 0 now there is a red Reb rank command
07:23 - also so you can just write Z Rev rank
07:28 - here and this is the reverse rank right
07:32 - so the rank will be sorted according to
07:36 - the score so highest score is the 0th
07:38 - index right and then the lowest score is
07:43 - the maximum index okay so for example my
07:47 - set 1 and then the member name for
07:51 - example e is the rank 0 here right
07:54 - because index of e is the highest rank
07:59 - rank is 100 for e right and it's the
08:03 - biggest rank that means the index for it
08:07 - will be 0 because we are printing the
08:10 - reverse rank here ok for example you
08:13 - want to see the index of a it will be 3
08:17 - because it's in reverse order now the
08:19 - last command I'm going to show you here
08:21 - is z-score command okay and then I can
08:27 - give the key name and the member name so
08:30 - for example I will give the member a and
08:33 - then this enter is going to give me the
08:36 - score value of this member right so for
08:40 - example I want to see the score of
08:42 - member E and press Enter
08:45 - it's going to give me hundred because
08:46 - score associated with II was hundred
08:50 - right and for example this
08:53 - when you does not exist in our sort of
08:56 - set for example I just added or given
08:58 - the random value here and then press
09:01 - Enter
09:02 - is going to return the nil value which
09:05 - does not exist
09:06 - okay now let me clear the terminal
09:09 - let me show one more command to you so
09:12 - for example I just want to print the
09:15 - range of my set 1 0 to minus 1 and this
09:22 - is a CBE and I want to add one more
09:25 - value here so I will just add as I'd add
09:28 - and I want to add this value to my set 1
09:31 - and at the school 1 and I want to add
09:35 - for example a a 5 times and then press
09:39 - ENTER and it and it returns me 1 that
09:42 - means the value for this score is now
09:45 - set to a a instead of a for example
09:50 - right so let me do the said range once
09:53 - again and you can see here the new value
09:57 - is added here which is e a right and if
10:03 - you remember the score of a was also 1
10:09 - right so let me give the same command
10:12 - now which is that score and this time I
10:15 - want to just see the score of a which is
10:20 - 1 and then I want to see the score of a
10:23 - a which is also 1 so it's totally fine
10:27 - if you give same score to multiple
10:31 - values right so for example I want to
10:34 - give one more value to the score for
10:38 - example bbbb and then press Enter and
10:41 - once again the range I want to see this
10:44 - value is added and then I want to see
10:47 - see the score of bee bee bee bee
10:50 - so bee bee bee bee and you can see the
10:53 - score is still 1 okay so it's totally
10:56 - fine to have one score for multiple
11:01 - values now what happened
11:04 - to the rank here so for you amplified
11:07 - rank for my set 1 so my set 1 and then
11:13 - BB BB and the index here is 2 so this is
11:18 - how sorted set works now there is one
11:21 - more command which is said range by
11:25 - score and then you can give the key name
11:30 - and then the score value minimum score
11:33 - for example 1 and then the maximum score
11:36 - for example I'm going to give you a 2
11:38 - right and then just enter and I get here
11:42 - three values because there are three
11:47 - values associated with the score one and
11:49 - I think there was no score for two right
11:53 - so no value was associated with two so
11:56 - let's see one two four for example and
12:00 - now I can see these values and see also
12:04 - so if you want to get values by the
12:07 - range of scores then you can use that
12:10 - range by score okay so this is how you
12:14 - can use sorted sets in Redis there are
12:17 - some more commands which are associated
12:20 - with sort of set you can just search for
12:23 - them and then practice them but these
12:25 - are some of the most frequently used
12:27 - command with the sorted set so I hope

hey guys welcome to the next video on register total for beginners and in this video we will learn how we can use sorted sets in Redis so first of all what are sorted sets so ready sorted sets are similar to the Redis sets with a unique feature that their members can be sorted now every member of a sorted set is associated with a score and based on the score their members can be sorted right so you can see in this diagram the Redis key will remain the same as other patterns but here you can see a score here so you can define a score for example I will define a score 100 and then the value associated with the score so the value associated with the score is value do and this is our member of a set and there is a new feature in the sorted set which is this score right so you can define a score and with the score you can define a member or a value associated with it and then on the basis of that we can sort the members of our set right so let's see in practical how it works so I'm going to open my Redis CLI so the first command we are going to learn here is that ad and the said ad is used to create a set if it does not exist or add a member to this set if it already exists right so every command in sorted set will start with this character Z and then whatever its function is the function name for example right so that ad and then the key name for example my set 1 and the score so score is 1 and the value associated with it so squarely for example you want to associate it with the school 1 is a write in a similar way we can define multiple school or members here so score and the value associated whether two and B for example 3 is the third score and the value we want to associate with it is C and then they need not be in order so score can be 5 now and the value can be D here right or any other value right and then press ENTER and you can see four numbers are inserted in the sorted set now to get the members of a sorted set you use Z and then range command okay as we have seen in the sets also and then what is your key name for example my set 1 and then starting value and the end value as we have seen in the case of sets also so in the case of sets we have seen that 0 and 1 are going to give all the values in the set right so press ENTER and you can see here all the values are printed here now you can see here the values are printed not the you know scores associated with them right so for example I once again write that add and then set 1 nice add 1 and then for example I can just give score 100 here and then the value is here right and then press ENTER and once again I will just give that range my set 1 and then you can see all the venues here or all the members here but these are not the schools these are just order ordered number now if you want to know how many number of members are there in our set you can use that card here okay and the key name for example my set 1 and then press enter and I can see that there are 5 members in my sorted set right now in order to get the count of members in the sorted set with the scores in the given range we use LED count okay and then the key name so my set one and the minimum and the maximum are score value here so for example I want to get one two three here okay and then press ENTER and then it is going to count the number of values between this range right so for example I will just write 1 2 5 here and values are 4 because in between school 1 and score 5 there are 4 values including those scores now I can just write 1 250 here or 55 and still it's going to give us 4 values number of values because the last score we have associated here is 100 so when we write here 1 0 1 here and then press ENTER then only it's going to give us 5 values and let's say we can give 99 here still it gives the 4 value so the said count is going to take the score values and then depending upon the score values is going to give you the number of values in between these scores now let me clear the terminal and to remove any member from a set you use read REM and then the key name my set and member so the member here will be the member value so not the score but the member so for example I want to remove the member B so I can just give the value of member of B and then press ENTER and once again I will just give this said range command and now it's giving the same answer because I haven't given the right key name so I must give that M my set 1 here right and then it gives integer 1 that means the command is successful and once again the range and now you can see the value is removed from here now if you want to determine the index of a member in a sorted set you use that rank here so just give reside rank amount and then my set 1 and the member name so for example D here and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the index of this D right so the index starts from 0 so 0 1 2 right for example I want to see the index of ye here is going to give me the index 3 and for example for member a the index is 0 now there is a red Reb rank command also so you can just write Z Rev rank here and this is the reverse rank right so the rank will be sorted according to the score so highest score is the 0th index right and then the lowest score is the maximum index okay so for example my set 1 and then the member name for example e is the rank 0 here right because index of e is the highest rank rank is 100 for e right and it's the biggest rank that means the index for it will be 0 because we are printing the reverse rank here ok for example you want to see the index of a it will be 3 because it's in reverse order now the last command I'm going to show you here is zscore command okay and then I can give the key name and the member name so for example I will give the member a and then this enter is going to give me the score value of this member right so for example I want to see the score of member E and press Enter it's going to give me hundred because score associated with II was hundred right and for example this when you does not exist in our sort of set for example I just added or given the random value here and then press Enter is going to return the nil value which does not exist okay now let me clear the terminal let me show one more command to you so for example I just want to print the range of my set 1 0 to minus 1 and this is a CBE and I want to add one more value here so I will just add as I'd add and I want to add this value to my set 1 and at the school 1 and I want to add for example a a 5 times and then press ENTER and it and it returns me 1 that means the value for this score is now set to a a instead of a for example right so let me do the said range once again and you can see here the new value is added here which is e a right and if you remember the score of a was also 1 right so let me give the same command now which is that score and this time I want to just see the score of a which is 1 and then I want to see the score of a a which is also 1 so it's totally fine if you give same score to multiple values right so for example I want to give one more value to the score for example bbbb and then press Enter and once again the range I want to see this value is added and then I want to see see the score of bee bee bee bee so bee bee bee bee and you can see the score is still 1 okay so it's totally fine to have one score for multiple values now what happened to the rank here so for you amplified rank for my set 1 so my set 1 and then BB BB and the index here is 2 so this is how sorted set works now there is one more command which is said range by score and then you can give the key name and then the score value minimum score for example 1 and then the maximum score for example I'm going to give you a 2 right and then just enter and I get here three values because there are three values associated with the score one and I think there was no score for two right so no value was associated with two so let's see one two four for example and now I can see these values and see also so if you want to get values by the range of scores then you can use that range by score okay so this is how you can use sorted sets in Redis there are some more commands which are associated with sort of set you can just search for them and then practice them but these are some of the most frequently used command with the sorted set so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
