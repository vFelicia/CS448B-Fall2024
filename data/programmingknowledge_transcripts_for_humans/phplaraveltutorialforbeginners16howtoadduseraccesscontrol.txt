00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part 16 of our laravel
00:07 - for beginners tutorial series and in the
00:10 - previous video we have worked with user
00:12 - authentication and we have laid the
00:16 - modal relationships and in this video
00:19 - we're going to discuss about how to
00:21 - actually implement the user access
00:25 - control so basically we're just going to
00:27 - add a feature that will just enable us
00:30 - to control which pages will our user be
00:34 - able to access so in here let's try to
00:39 - see we have here in our project or home
00:43 - page of our project and as you can see
00:45 - we can always access the post create so
00:54 - if you go to post and then great so we
00:59 - can already create a post even if we
01:02 - have or we are not logged in right so
01:06 - apparently we're not login with our
01:08 - account and we can create certain post
01:13 - but we don't want that the user should
01:15 - login first before they can create a
01:17 - post so also you can see that if we go
01:24 - to blood and then click the post we can
01:28 - see the buttons and edit and delete even
01:33 - if you are not logged in as a user so
01:36 - again we don't want that we want the
01:38 - user to login first before they can
01:40 - modify you can delete and create a post
01:43 - so in order for us to do that let's go
01:45 - back to our code editor and try to
01:48 - modify our project if we go to the
01:51 - controller of our homepage so app and
01:54 - then HTTP controllers and then home
01:58 - controller we can see here we're adding
02:01 - the middle we're both in this construct
02:05 - method so we're just going to copy this
02:07 - for our other con controllers so copy
02:11 - and then we're going
02:13 - to do the same thing for our post
02:15 - controller so that's post and then we're
02:21 - just going to paste the construct method
02:25 - or function coming from the home
02:29 - controller class again we're doing this
02:31 - just to control the access of the non
02:35 - log end users so if you try to go back
02:38 - to our browser so if you try to go to
02:41 - slash a post and then create so we won't
02:48 - be able to create a post right now and
02:50 - it booted us out from the create forum
02:53 - or create post form so it says that we
02:57 - need to log in but there's a problem
03:01 - with this because if you try to go to
03:03 - our blog so it says that we need to
03:06 - login just to view the blogs right so we
03:09 - don't want that and we just want to
03:12 - limit the access when we try to create a
03:15 - post so let's try to accept the other
03:20 - pages for that so in here we need to
03:23 - pass in an array so this will be an
03:27 - array of pages that will be accepted so
03:32 - accept and then the array or the actual
03:37 - array of pages so it's going to be the
03:40 - index and of course the show page sort
03:45 - of say that and go to our browser so we
03:52 - should be able to view the blog so this
03:57 - are the post and we can you just we
04:03 - can't access the create for now right
04:06 - because we're not login oh should be
04:12 - post and then great so try to log in by
04:18 - using our account so log in there you go
04:22 - we can access deep
04:24 - great post and now let's just solve the
04:28 - problem with the individual post if you
04:31 - try to go to a single post you can see
04:35 - even if we get lag out from this page
04:40 - love and then post we can see the edit
04:44 - and delete buttons and we don't want
04:47 - that we just want to see the post
04:50 - without these buttons edit and delete so
04:55 - in order for us to do that let's go to
04:57 - the post so that's where is it resources
05:05 - and then views and post and then show
05:11 - so where's let's go to this part right
05:14 - here when displaying the edit and delete
05:18 - button so I think we're just going to
05:20 - add a certain if statement here so oath
05:25 - and then not guess and then let's just
05:34 - say and if here so basically we're just
05:41 - limiting the access to these buttons and
05:44 - it should be gone there for now so if
05:52 - you are not logged in and you go to a
05:55 - single post you can not edit and delete
05:58 - the post but if we try to lag in by
06:01 - using our account so basically we should
06:06 - be able to have the yeah edit and delete
06:12 - button so log out and go back to that
06:17 - particular post no edit and delete
06:21 - button but also we need to change
06:25 - something here because we need to only
06:29 - show those edit and delete buttons if
06:32 - you are the owner of that particular
06:34 - post so let's go back to the show that
06:37 - later
06:38 - and in here we need to add another if so
06:41 - that will be if and then o'the user so
06:48 - basically we're just going to check if
06:51 - the currently logged in user is the
06:53 - owner of this particular post so that
06:56 - will be post and then the user ID so
07:00 - remember we are we added that particular
07:03 - attribute user ID by using the migration
07:06 - so and we're going to end the if
07:11 - statement here so there you go so you
07:18 - won't be able to access the edit and
07:21 - delete button even if you are logged in
07:25 - if you're not the owner of that
07:28 - particular post so so for example this
07:33 - one so we're not the owner or the
07:35 - currently login user is not the owner of
07:37 - this particular post so but this one is
07:42 - the one posted this particular post so
07:46 - he should be able to edit and delete
07:49 - this post but we need to solve another
07:52 - problem here so as you can see we can
07:56 - edit this particular post but if we try
08:00 - to have like five here this is a post
08:05 - from another user so right so we don't
08:09 - need or we don't want this actual user
08:13 - or this particular user to be editing
08:16 - other post or other users post so what
08:22 - we need is to go to our post controller
08:26 - and in our edit in our ad function we
08:33 - need to have a some sort of check in
08:40 - here so below this one we need to check
08:44 - if the user or authenticated user
08:49 - meaning the login user
08:52 - ID is not equal to the post user ID so
09:04 - again we're just checking a this
09:07 - particular login the user is the owner
09:09 - or not the owner of the post so if is
09:15 - not the owner of the post so it should
09:17 - return read the wreck and then we need
09:22 - to pass in the post it should redirect
09:26 - to the post page and then with an error
09:30 - message so error and then it should say
09:36 - an authorized an authorized page okay so
09:44 - save that and let's go back to our
09:47 - browser and try to go to blog and then
09:53 - first post so the ID is 6 and then edit
09:58 - so if you try to have or put 5 in here
10:03 - so it should say or it should redirect
10:06 - into the post page but I think we don't
10:11 - have the error message here so let's try
10:14 - to add that in our layout so that will
10:19 - be from the layout and then app that
10:22 - laid that PHP we have to include the
10:26 - error messages or messages here in our
10:29 - page so it should be here so in here
10:34 - let's just add the messages layout so
10:39 - include and then i NC folder and then
10:45 - messages so it will refer to the I NC
10:50 - and then messages that made that pay HP
10:53 - so save this and let's go back to the
10:56 - browser and host indeed and 5
11:04 - so it should say an authorised page
11:07 - because we're not authorized to access
11:10 - this post or this particular post and we
11:16 - cannot edit this because this is not the
11:19 - post or this is not a post of this team
11:22 - so user so I think we need to do the
11:26 - same with the delete button also so
11:30 - let's go to the post controller and then
11:33 - we also have the destroy here so I think
11:37 - we're just going to copy the illogic
11:40 - that we have used in our edit function
11:42 - and paste it here in our destroy
11:48 - function so after that so post so if all
11:54 - user ID is not equal to the post user ID
11:58 - so it should redirect to the post page
12:02 - and with an error message of delete so I
12:06 - think that's all there is to it for this
12:08 - tutorial and in this case we have
12:11 - limited the users capability when it
12:14 - comes to the posts that do not belong to
12:18 - them so see you in the next video thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part 16 of our laravel for beginners tutorial series and in the previous video we have worked with user authentication and we have laid the modal relationships and in this video we're going to discuss about how to actually implement the user access control so basically we're just going to add a feature that will just enable us to control which pages will our user be able to access so in here let's try to see we have here in our project or home page of our project and as you can see we can always

then we're just going to paste the construct method or function coming from the home controller class again we're doing this just to control the access of the non log end users so if you try to go

we can you just we can't access the create for now right because we're not login oh should be post and then great so try to log in by using our account so log in there you go we can access deep great post and now let's just solve the problem with the individual post if you try to go to a single post you can see even if we get lag out from this page love and then post we can see the edit and delete

access the edit and delete button even if you are logged in if you're not the owner of that particular post so so for example this one so we're not the owner or the currently login user is not the owner of this particular post so but this one is the one posted this particular post so he should be able to edit and delete this post but we need to solve another problem here so as you can see we can edit this particular post but if we try to have like five here this is a post from another user so right so we don't need or we don't want this actual user or this particular user to be editing other post or other users post so what we need is to go to our post controller and in our edit in our ad function we need to have a some sort of check in here so below this one we need to check if the

after that so post so if all user ID is not equal to the post user ID so it should redirect to the post page and with an error message of delete so I think that's all there is to it for this tutorial and in this case we have limited the users capability when it comes to the posts that do not belong to them so see you in the next video thanks
