00:00 - in this video we are going to talk about
00:02 - the data types that are supported in
00:04 - ultrix
00:05 - so as we know that alteryx is a
00:07 - self-service data analytics tool
00:09 - it makes the process of etl easier
00:13 - and it is a super tool that combines the
00:15 - functionalities that are required for
00:17 - the steps of data preparation geospatial
00:20 - analysis and data science
00:22 - mainly to support all these
00:24 - functionalities alteryx
00:26 - uses these five data types
00:29 - these are the five data types that are
00:30 - supported in ultrix which are string
00:33 - data numeric data date and time data
00:35 - boolean data and spatial objects once
00:38 - the data is brought into ultrix the
00:40 - alterex data type is applied to the
00:42 - entire column and each value within that
00:45 - column
00:46 - alteryx tends to use the best suitable
00:48 - data type for the data coming from the
00:50 - databases or the structured files such
00:52 - as excel within the alteryx table
00:56 - now let us look at all of these data
00:58 - types in detail one by one
01:00 - so first of all we come to the string
01:02 - data type
01:03 - string data represents only text even if
01:06 - the data is numeric or spaces or special
01:08 - characters if a string consists of
01:10 - numbers it is ideally advised uh to
01:13 - first convert it to the numeric data
01:15 - type then you can just perform the
01:16 - calculations into it
01:18 - the string data is the one that is kept
01:21 - as it is
01:23 - it is further divided into these four
01:24 - categories that is string
01:26 - v string w string and v underscore
01:29 - string
01:30 - string and w string are a fixed length
01:33 - and you have to set the predefined
01:34 - length of the string so suppose you have
01:36 - set 8 to 100 characters then every time
01:38 - it would take a hundred characters
01:41 - um the w string can hold more
01:43 - international characters
01:45 - now we have v string and we underscore w
01:47 - string it stands for variable the v here
01:50 - stands for variable that means we cannot
01:52 - set any predefined length or we should
01:54 - not send
01:56 - any predefined length and it adjusts
01:58 - itself according to the length
02:00 - of the text of of the value that it is
02:03 - going to hold
02:05 - next we have is the numeric data type
02:07 - numeric alteryx data types
02:10 - are the ones that contains only the
02:12 - numbers
02:13 - it stores the numbers
02:15 - that could be represented by either a
02:17 - single digit or by multiple digits as
02:19 - well
02:20 - we have different combinations in this
02:22 - like byte integer
02:24 - fixed decimal float and double
02:27 - byte and integer are the whole numbers
02:29 - fixed decimal float and double include a
02:32 - decimal number as well
02:34 - byte is a small number then we have
02:36 - integer which has more significant
02:38 - numbers as you can see their range as
02:39 - well in the examples
02:42 - um then we have fixed decimal which is
02:44 - used for currency and float and double
02:48 - so this is fixed decimal which is used
02:49 - as a currency
02:51 - that's a numeric value with a decimal
02:54 - next we have the float and double which
02:56 - are used for more
02:57 - precise numbers
02:59 - float and code are not
03:00 - good because it comes to comparison they
03:03 - are never equal
03:05 - float is generally used to save the
03:07 - memory
03:09 - now the next data type we have is the
03:10 - date time data type
03:12 - uh in altrix the format of date
03:16 - time and date and time combined together
03:18 - are fixed
03:19 - so you will need to do some manipulation
03:21 - on your data if it is not in the format
03:24 - that you need
03:25 - as generalized by ultrex
03:28 - sometimes it is very difficult to work
03:30 - with date and time
03:31 - there is a tool known as the date time
03:33 - macro that converts the date and time in
03:36 - human readable as well as alteryx
03:38 - readable format
03:40 - so the format is as you can see for the
03:42 - date there is a 10 character string
03:44 - employing four characters for year
03:47 - two for month and two for date this is
03:49 - the general format that is supported by
03:51 - ultrix
03:52 - then we have time which is again an
03:54 - eight character string
03:56 - two characters for r2 for minutes and
03:58 - two for seconds and the examples have
04:01 - been shown on the right side of the
04:02 - screen
04:03 - next we have date and time combined
04:05 - which is a 19 character string
04:07 - employing four characters for the year
04:10 - two for the month two for the date and
04:12 - two each for the hours minutes and
04:13 - seconds
04:14 - and an example has been shown on the
04:16 - right side
04:18 - so these are the date and time data
04:20 - types that are supported in ultrix
04:22 - next we have is the boolean data type
04:26 - so the boolean
04:27 - basically represents a flag and it has
04:30 - only two possible values that is true
04:32 - and false so true means non-zero or one
04:36 - and false means zero
04:39 - or basically any other digit that is not
04:42 - zero can be considered as true
04:44 - boolean is used to basically
04:47 - characterize the objects categorize them
04:49 - into various categories or identify them
04:51 - whether the objects
04:53 - are a part of the particular category or
04:55 - not for example let's take a ah a
04:58 - student data set
04:59 - so
05:00 - in the student data set we can check
05:02 - that if the student has passed the test
05:05 - or not so we can just create or the data
05:08 - can have a column as passed it could
05:11 - have values true false or yes no
05:14 - so true false in that case would be
05:16 - represented using the boolean data types
05:21 - next we have is the spatial objects
05:23 - spatial objects are used for mapping
05:26 - and are associated with maintaining the
05:28 - data records
05:29 - a point a line polyline or polygon all
05:34 - comes out of spatial objects which can
05:36 - be used for mapping
05:38 - uh it is associated with the data record
05:41 - and
05:42 - they can be multiple spatial object
05:44 - fields in a table
05:46 - furthermore if you want to use any of
05:48 - the data like which is
05:51 - which cannot be represented in the
05:52 - format of a text like uh let's suppose
05:54 - an image or a video
05:56 - or an audio file then we use the spatial
05:59 - objects again
06:01 - so what happens is when you just
06:03 - import the
06:05 - table or any kind of an excel file
06:08 - then what happens is these spatial
06:10 - objects are
06:11 - automatically invoked actually there are
06:14 - two ways through which
06:16 - this alteryx
06:18 - imports this data types like how it uses
06:21 - these data types so let us take a look
06:22 - at them as well
06:24 - data in ultrix can be brought through
06:26 - these two fields or three
06:29 - through these two tools that is the auto
06:31 - field tool and the select tool now what
06:33 - is the difference between them auto
06:35 - field tool is used to select the data
06:37 - type automatically by alterix while the
06:39 - select tool
06:41 - helps the user to decide the data type
06:43 - so in case you are a user and you don't
06:45 - want an overhead of selecting the data
06:48 - day for altrix you can just go for the
06:50 - auto field tool
06:52 - so auto field tool is used to read
06:54 - through all of the records of an input
06:56 - and set the field type to the smallest
06:58 - possible size that is relative to the
07:01 - data contained in the column the tool
07:03 - correctly assigns a numeric field to a
07:06 - string data type where any record starts
07:08 - with 0 and not a number
07:11 - so in order to configure the tool we can
07:13 - just go to the select string fields to
07:15 - auto change field type
07:17 - and select the fields to auto configure
07:19 - them
07:20 - we can use either individually or all
07:22 - the fields at once as well
07:26 - next we have is the select tool so the
07:28 - select tool is used to include exclude
07:31 - and reorder the columns of data that
07:33 - pass through your workflow excluding the
07:35 - columns that can limit the data passing
07:37 - through a workflow and improve
07:39 - performance we can also use the select
07:41 - tool to modify the type and size of the
07:43 - data rename a column or add a
07:45 - description to it
07:47 - now there are other tools that include
07:49 - the select tool functionality such
07:51 - are append fields tool fine nearest tool
07:54 - join tool join multiple tool select db
07:56 - tool and spatial match tool
07:59 - we can use the table to modify the
08:00 - incoming data stream each row in the
08:02 - table represents a column in the data
08:05 - the field column in the table identifies
08:07 - the name of the column in the data and
08:09 - auto sizes to fit the column names
08:11 - without cutting off any text which is
08:13 - taken up to 40 characters
08:15 - so this is how the autofill tool and the
08:18 - select tool works
08:20 - in itrex now as we know that there are
08:22 - multiple tools in ultrix and each of
08:25 - them have a specific functionality in
08:28 - case you are interested in learning more
08:30 - about these tools then what you can do
08:32 - is refer to the official alteryx
08:35 - documentation now how to access it let
08:37 - me show you
08:38 - so in order to access it uh first of all
08:40 - i have opened up google and all you need
08:42 - to do is google alteryx help
08:46 - so once you uh google it the first link
08:48 - that comes up is the home page instead
08:50 - of going to the home page you can select
08:52 - on this documentation
08:54 - link so what would happen is the whole
08:57 - alteryx health documentation would be
09:00 - open in front of you now in case you
09:02 - want to learn about anything related to
09:03 - altrix you can refer to this
09:05 - documentation which is
09:06 - very much precise and clean
09:09 - in case you want to learn about these
09:10 - tools specific tools then you can refer
09:13 - to this um
09:14 - menu over here where all the tools are
09:17 - present and they are configured or they
09:19 - are
09:20 - grouped together like all these tools
09:23 - that are present in the in out tab are
09:24 - together grouped in this in out the
09:27 - tools that are present in the
09:28 - preparation tab are all present over
09:30 - here you can click on any of these links
09:32 - and that link would be opened here you
09:34 - would find the
09:36 - way through which you can use the tools
09:38 - how to use it how is it looking and how
09:41 - you can configure it
09:44 - then uh
09:45 - you can also see some examples that what
09:47 - would happen when this tool is being
09:49 - used what kind of output you would be
09:51 - think so these are
09:54 - the documentation that would help you to
09:55 - learn about all the tools in altrix but
09:58 - the common ones that are used and the
10:00 - most important ones we would be covering
10:02 - in this course so stay tuned for the
10:03 - next video that's all for this one
10:05 - thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to talk about the data types that are supported in ultrix so as we know that alteryx is a selfservice data analytics tool it makes the process of etl easier and it is a super tool that combines the functionalities that are required for the steps of data preparation geospatial analysis and data science mainly to support all these functionalities alteryx uses these five data types these are the five data types that are supported in ultrix which are string data numeric data date and time data boolean data and spatial objects once the data is brought into ultrix the alterex data type is applied to the entire column and each value within that column alteryx tends to use the best suitable data type for the data coming from the databases or the structured files such as excel within the alteryx table now let us look at all of these data types in detail one by one so first of all we come to the string data type string data represents only text even if the data is numeric or spaces or special characters if a string consists of numbers it is ideally advised uh to first convert it to the numeric data type then you can just perform the calculations into it the string data is the one that is kept as it is it is further divided into these four categories that is string v string w string and v underscore string string and w string are a fixed length and you have to set the predefined length of the string so suppose you have set 8 to 100 characters then every time it would take a hundred characters um the w string can hold more international characters now we have v string and we underscore w string it stands for variable the v here stands for variable that means we cannot set any predefined length or we should not send any predefined length and it adjusts itself according to the length of the text of of the value that it is going to hold next we have is the numeric data type numeric alteryx data types are the ones that contains only the numbers it stores the numbers that could be represented by either a single digit or by multiple digits as well we have different combinations in this like byte integer fixed decimal float and double byte and integer are the whole numbers fixed decimal float and double include a decimal number as well byte is a small number then we have integer which has more significant numbers as you can see their range as well in the examples um then we have fixed decimal which is used for currency and float and double so this is fixed decimal which is used as a currency that's a numeric value with a decimal next we have the float and double which are used for more precise numbers float and code are not good because it comes to comparison they are never equal float is generally used to save the memory now the next data type we have is the date time data type uh in altrix the format of date time and date and time combined together are fixed so you will need to do some manipulation on your data if it is not in the format that you need as generalized by ultrex sometimes it is very difficult to work with date and time there is a tool known as the date time macro that converts the date and time in human readable as well as alteryx readable format so the format is as you can see for the date there is a 10 character string employing four characters for year two for month and two for date this is the general format that is supported by ultrix then we have time which is again an eight character string two characters for r2 for minutes and two for seconds and the examples have been shown on the right side of the screen next we have date and time combined which is a 19 character string employing four characters for the year two for the month two for the date and two each for the hours minutes and seconds and an example has been shown on the right side so these are the date and time data types that are supported in ultrix next we have is the boolean data type so the boolean basically represents a flag and it has only two possible values that is true and false so true means nonzero or one and false means zero or basically any other digit that is not zero can be considered as true boolean is used to basically characterize the objects categorize them into various categories or identify them whether the objects are a part of the particular category or not for example let's take a ah a student data set so in the student data set we can check that if the student has passed the test or not so we can just create or the data can have a column as passed it could have values true false or yes no so true false in that case would be represented using the boolean data types next we have is the spatial objects spatial objects are used for mapping and are associated with maintaining the data records a point a line polyline or polygon all comes out of spatial objects which can be used for mapping uh it is associated with the data record and they can be multiple spatial object fields in a table furthermore if you want to use any of the data like which is which cannot be represented in the format of a text like uh let's suppose an image or a video or an audio file then we use the spatial objects again so what happens is when you just import the table or any kind of an excel file then what happens is these spatial objects are automatically invoked actually there are two ways through which this alteryx imports this data types like how it uses these data types so let us take a look at them as well data in ultrix can be brought through these two fields or three

tool is used to read through all of the records of an input and set the field type to the smallest possible size that is relative to the data contained in the column the tool correctly assigns a numeric field to a string data type where any record starts with 0 and not a number so in order to configure the tool we can just go to the select string fields to auto change field type and select the fields to auto configure them we can use either individually or all the fields at once as well next we have is the select tool so the select tool is used to include exclude and reorder the columns of data that pass through your workflow excluding the columns that can limit the data passing through a workflow and improve performance we can also use the select tool to modify the type and size of the data rename a column or add a description to it now there are other tools that include the select tool functionality such are append fields tool fine nearest tool join tool join multiple tool select db tool and spatial match tool we can use the table to modify the incoming data stream each row in the table represents a column in the data the field column in the table identifies the name of the column in the data and auto sizes to fit the column names without cutting off any text which is taken up to 40 characters so this is how the autofill tool and the select tool works in itrex now as we know that there are multiple tools in ultrix and each of them have a specific functionality in case you are interested in learning more about these tools then what you can do is refer to the official alteryx documentation now how to access it let me show you so in order to access it uh first of all i have opened up google and all you need to do is google alteryx help so once you uh google it the first link that comes up is the home page instead of going to the home page you can select on this documentation link so what would happen is the whole alteryx health documentation would be

specific tools then you can refer to this um menu over here where all the tools are present and they are configured or they are grouped together like all these tools that are present in the in out tab are together grouped in this in out the tools that are present in the preparation tab are all present over here you can click on any of these links and that link would be opened here you would find the way through which you can use the tools how to use it how is it looking and how you can configure it then uh you can also see some examples that what would happen when this tool is being used what kind of output you would be think so these are the documentation that would help you to learn about all the tools in altrix but the common ones that are used and the most important ones we would be covering in this course so stay tuned for the next video that's all for this one thanks for watching
