00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can use echo command in
00:05 - Linux and I'm also going to show you how
00:07 - we can declare variables and how we can
00:10 - use these variables with our echo
00:13 - command so let's get started so first of
00:16 - all to use echo command you just use
00:19 - echo and then some text for example
00:22 - hello world and press Enter and what it
00:27 - does according to its name it just
00:30 - displayed displays whatever you right
00:34 - after this echo command so it echoes
00:37 - anything which you right after this
00:39 - keyword echo right now you may say that
00:43 - it's good for nothing because it's just
00:46 - echoing whatever we write after this and
00:49 - it's not really useful but the use of
00:53 - this echo command comes when you are
00:56 - using some scripting for example bash
00:59 - scripting and then it becomes really you
01:03 - know important sometimes to use echo and
01:07 - maybe in the next video I will show you
01:09 - a brief introduction to scripting also
01:12 - and then you will be able to understand
01:15 - how echo is important right so this is
01:19 - how you can use echo but there is a good
01:22 - practice to use echo also which is you
01:26 - just use echo and then you use double
01:29 - quotes around your text or whatever you
01:33 - want to display so for example hello
01:36 - world again and then it displays the
01:39 - same content but it's better to use
01:42 - double quotes around your text okay now
01:47 - how to use variables in terminal or in
01:52 - Linux so in order to declare a variable
01:54 - you just need to give a name to your
01:58 - variable for example my where for my
02:03 - variable and then give equals to sign so
02:07 - it's important here to note that
02:10 - I'm not providing any space between the
02:13 - variable name and equal to symbol
02:15 - so don't provide any space in between
02:18 - okay and then give any value to your
02:22 - variable for example I will give some
02:24 - name for example mark and when you press
02:27 - ENTER it does nothing but whenever you
02:31 - want to you know know the value of this
02:34 - variable you can use echo so just write
02:37 - echo and then the dollar symbol so just
02:41 - use this kind of a dollar symbol and
02:44 - then the name of your variable for
02:47 - example my wire okay and press ENTER and
02:51 - it will display the content of this
02:53 - variable right so what we have done here
02:56 - is we have given some name to our
02:59 - variable and we have assigned some value
03:01 - to our variable using equal to and in
03:04 - order to display the content of a
03:06 - variable you can use echo and a dollar
03:10 - symbol before your variable name and
03:12 - then variable name and it will echo the
03:15 - content of the variable right now for
03:18 - example I can declare some other
03:21 - variable also but before this I want to
03:24 - let you know that this variable is only
03:29 - valid for this session of the terminal
03:32 - so as soon as you will you know close
03:35 - the terminal then your variable value
03:38 - will be gone right so it's only valid
03:41 - for this session of the terminal right
03:43 - now let's declare some other variable
03:46 - for example X is equal to 10 which is a
03:49 - integer for example okay and press Enter
03:53 - and does nothing and then we can echo
03:56 - something like this so echo and then for
04:01 - example I will just write in double
04:03 - quotes the value of x is and then the
04:11 - dollar symbol and then the name of your
04:15 - variable which is X right and press
04:18 - enter and what it prints the value of x
04:22 - is
04:23 - which is the value we have assigned to
04:26 - our variable right so in this way you
04:29 - can declare a variable and you know echo
04:32 - its value using echo and these two
04:35 - things are very important whenever you
04:37 - are using scripting right and that we
04:42 - will see in the next video now there are
04:45 - some options
04:46 - you can use with echo so for example
04:50 - when for example you want to escape
04:54 - something then what you can do so for
04:58 - example I will just use echo and then I
05:02 - will use - 'flag for escape and then I
05:06 - will use single quotes here and for
05:09 - example I will say some text so some and
05:14 - I will just provide this for example
05:18 - backslash and then the next word for
05:23 - example text okay and this will be
05:27 - escaped because we are using - see here
05:31 - and let's see what happens so once we
05:34 - press Enter it gives the tab between the
05:39 - text so one thing worth noting here is
05:45 - whenever you will give this flag called
05:49 - - e it will enable interpretation of
05:53 - backslash as an escape sequence and then
05:57 - you can use a different kind of sequence
06:01 - something like for example backspace or
06:05 - you can use a newline you know escape
06:08 - sequence or you can use tabs as we have
06:12 - seen that it haven't printed some and
06:15 - then text it has printed some and then e
06:19 - XD because backslash t is for tab in for
06:25 - horizontal temp to be more precise and
06:28 - you know in bash scripting right so
06:32 - whenever you want to
06:35 - use you know backslashes or escape
06:37 - sequence you can use - II as a flag
06:41 - right so let's see some other examples
06:45 - of using this so I will just echo it
06:49 - once again and this time what I'm going
06:51 - to do is I will use backslash N and then
06:54 - some text something like this and press
06:57 - Enter and you can see it prints the you
07:01 - know text in the new line so you can see
07:04 - some is in the first line and text in
07:07 - the new line after the space right or
07:10 - you can do something like this without
07:12 - space and press Enter and you can see
07:14 - both are printed in the next line and
07:19 - there are some more you know sequences
07:22 - for example backslash B or other
07:25 - sequences something like backslash a
07:28 - which is for a lot or some other
07:32 - sequences which you can you know search
07:35 - for using Man Man pages and you will be
07:39 - good to go so this is how you can use
07:41 - echo and you can declare variables in
07:45 - Linux I hope you enjoyed this video
07:47 - please rate comment subscribe and bye
07:49 - for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can use echo command in Linux and I'm also going to show you how we can declare variables and how we can use these variables with our echo command so let's get started so first of all to use echo command you just use echo and then some text for example hello world and press Enter and what it does according to its name it just displayed displays whatever you right after this echo command so it echoes anything which you right after this keyword echo right now you may say that it's good for nothing because it's just echoing whatever we write after this and it's not really useful but the use of this echo command comes when you are using some scripting for example bash scripting and then it becomes really you know important sometimes to use echo and maybe in the next video I will show you a brief introduction to scripting also and then you will be able to understand how echo is important right so this is how you can use echo but there is a good practice to use echo also which is you just use echo and then you use double quotes around your text or whatever you want to display so for example hello world again and then it displays the same content but it's better to use double quotes around your text okay now how to use variables in terminal or in Linux so in order to declare a variable you just need to give a name to your variable for example my where for my variable and then give equals to sign so it's important here to note that I'm not providing any space between the variable name and equal to symbol so don't provide any space in between okay and then give any value to your variable for example I will give some name for example mark and when you press ENTER it does nothing but whenever you want to you know know the value of this variable you can use echo so just write echo and then the dollar symbol so just use this kind of a dollar symbol and then the name of your variable for example my wire okay and press ENTER and it will display the content of this variable right so what we have done here is we have given some name to our variable and we have assigned some value to our variable using equal to and in order to display the content of a variable you can use echo and a dollar symbol before your variable name and then variable name and it will echo the content of the variable right now for example I can declare some other variable also but before this I want to let you know that this variable is only valid for this session of the terminal so as soon as you will you know close the terminal then your variable value will be gone right so it's only valid for this session of the terminal right now let's declare some other variable for example X is equal to 10 which is a integer for example okay and press Enter and does nothing and then we can echo something like this so echo and then for example I will just write in double quotes the value of x is and then the dollar symbol and then the name of your variable which is X right and press enter and what it prints the value of x is which is the value we have assigned to our variable right so in this way you can declare a variable and you know echo its value using echo and these two things are very important whenever you are using scripting right and that we will see in the next video now there are some options you can use with echo so for example when for example you want to escape something then what you can do so for example I will just use echo and then I will use 'flag for escape and then I will use single quotes here and for
