With timestamps:

00:00 - now in this video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the chh command okay so basically
00:03 - this is similar command uh just we
00:05 - learned about in previous View that is
00:07 - password command but in this we cannot
00:09 - change the password okay so we will
00:12 - start with the basic options and basic
00:15 - implementation of this command so that
00:16 - is Chas and using hyphen L you can get
00:19 - the information of a password of any
00:21 - account
00:22 - but before moving forward we will need
00:24 - to create a password sorry not password
00:28 - a user
00:30 - sudo not user ad I will use add user
00:35 - and I will name that user as a exabyte
00:44 - okay
00:46 - so I will just use like this x sub by
00:51 - height
00:52 - a byte exabyte okay
00:54 - password
00:58 - nothing nothing nothing
01:00 - why okay clear the screen now just chh
01:06 - and provide hyphen L as option and the
01:09 - username that is exabyte
01:13 - okay
01:13 - permission denied okay no problem we
01:16 - will just use the sudo and we will get
01:18 - the permission
01:20 - is that easy yes okay so here you can
01:23 - see the last password changes that 7
01:25 - like 30 September it means today's date
01:28 - and password expires never never nothing
01:30 - is added account expires the thing is
01:33 - added minimum number of days written
01:34 - password change is zero by default and
01:37 - by default maximum is 999 it's uh
01:40 - like it takes the date from 1970 I think
01:43 - that's why it's showing that number of
01:45 - days and warning warning is this like if
01:48 - your password get like
01:52 - uh uh ninth after before
01:56 - seven days of this completion you will
01:58 - get a warning okay so now let's move and
02:01 - I will use this we will use the maximum
02:04 - number of days like we will use hyphen M
02:06 - option to change the
02:09 - maximum number of days like this one
02:12 - so how we can do it cha is hyphen
02:15 - capital M I will just use 100 and the
02:17 - username that is uh
02:19 - this one and permission denied again
02:21 - because we have not used sudo let me use
02:24 - sudo and done and we will just clear the
02:27 - screen and just call that function and
02:29 - here on that command and here you can
02:31 - see the maximum number of days between
02:33 - password change is 100. now similarly
02:35 - you can just add the minimum number of
02:37 - days also what it will do like it will
02:39 - just you cannot change your password
02:42 - before that particular days whatever you
02:45 - specify in minimum days so you can do it
02:48 - it's simple just instead of capital M
02:50 - you will need to use iPhone M and you
02:52 - can use here the number of days that is
02:54 - 50. like till 50 days you cannot change
02:56 - your password
02:58 - again let me show the information
03:01 - and here you can see the 50 days like
03:04 - minimum number of days written password
03:05 - change is 50.
03:07 - moving forward if you will provide a
03:10 - minus one option then what will happen
03:12 - let's see
03:13 - with maximum amount of days it will
03:16 - remove that it will not check for that
03:18 - validation
03:20 - hyphen M and if I will provide -1 and I
03:24 - will do again check and here you can see
03:25 - minus one it will like it will not check
03:27 - for the maximum number of days if you
03:29 - will use minus one but I don't want to
03:31 - use minus one I will simply use the 100
03:34 - to keep things
03:37 - simple
03:38 - okay
03:39 - moving forward if you will use 0 in a
03:44 - small M like in minimum number of days
03:45 - it means the user can change the
03:48 - password anytime
03:51 - but if you but if you use some kind of
03:54 - number here then user can can change
03:57 - that person after that number of days if
03:59 - I'll use 0 then user can change the
04:01 - password anytime if he wants okay that
04:05 - is the main use of zero
04:07 - and but I will use 50 here okay
04:12 - now moving forward uh if you want to add
04:15 - the expiry date in your password like
04:17 - your password should expired after that
04:19 - certain number of days
04:21 - okay so how you can do it if I will use
04:23 - like this sudo
04:25 - foreign
04:30 - capital E and I will use the format as
04:34 - year 2022
04:37 - uh
04:38 - 10 and 0 1. in the username
04:46 - okay and tomorrow my password will get
04:48 - expired
04:50 - and here you can see account expires
04:53 - it's on October 1 2020
04:57 - two
04:58 - [Music]
04:59 - okay but password last password change
05:02 - this and password will expire when in
05:03 - January 2023 yeah it's a little bit like
05:06 - a logical thing
05:08 - but yes you can understand because we
05:10 - have not I have just used this expiry
05:13 - date
05:14 - like normally okay
05:16 - so moving forward if you want to use the
05:19 - warning like uh Suppose there are 100 is
05:22 - after 100 if possible get expired but
05:23 - you want to only use it before seven
05:25 - days then in that case you can use
05:26 - hyphen
05:28 - W option
05:32 - hyphen W and suppose we want to want the
05:35 - user before 10 days
05:37 - and here we got an error this is capital
05:41 - W set expiration warning days to one
05:45 - days
05:46 - okay
05:49 - sudo hyphen
05:52 - W10 yeah now done
05:56 - and here you can see
05:58 - number of days that is 10 as we have
06:00 - provided here
06:03 - okay
06:04 - so in this way you can change the expiry
06:07 - date minimum days of required to change
06:08 - the password password validation warning
06:11 - days
06:12 - you can do all the things with this
06:14 - particular command and also you can do
06:15 - same things with password command also
06:17 - but yeah if you don't want to change the
06:19 - password then you can use this command
06:21 - normally like you don't need to change
06:23 - the password again and again using
06:25 - password command okay
06:26 - so you have basically two commands to to
06:29 - this same thing that is password
06:32 - and this one
06:34 - what it was chhs okay
06:38 - so that's all for today's video guys and
06:40 - I hope you liked it if you have any
06:41 - queries you can ask in the comment
06:42 - section and we will meet you in the next
06:45 - video so thank you thank you for
06:46 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

now in this video we are going to learn about the chh command okay so basically this is similar command uh just we learned about in previous View that is password command but in this we cannot change the password okay so we will start with the basic options and basic implementation of this command so that is Chas and using hyphen L you can get the information of a password of any account but before moving forward we will need to create a password sorry not password a user sudo not user ad I will use add user and I will name that user as a exabyte okay so I will just use like this x sub by height a byte exabyte okay password nothing nothing nothing why okay clear the screen now just chh and provide hyphen L as option and the username that is exabyte okay permission denied okay no problem we will just use the sudo and we will get the permission is that easy yes okay so here you can see the last password changes that 7 like 30 September it means today's date and password expires never never nothing is added account expires the thing is added minimum number of days written password change is zero by default and by default maximum is 999 it's uh like it takes the date from 1970 I think that's why it's showing that number of days and warning warning is this like if your password get like uh uh ninth after before seven days of this completion you will get a warning okay so now let's move and I will use this we will use the maximum number of days like we will use hyphen M option to change the maximum number of days like this one so how we can do it cha is hyphen capital M I will just use 100 and the username that is uh this one and permission denied again because we have not used sudo let me use sudo and done and we will just clear the screen and just call that function and here on that command and here you can see the maximum number of days between password change is 100. now similarly you can just add the minimum number of days also what it will do like it will just you cannot change your password before that particular days whatever you specify in minimum days so you can do it it's simple just instead of capital M you will need to use iPhone M and you can use here the number of days that is 50. like till 50 days you cannot change your password again let me show the information and here you can see the 50 days like minimum number of days written password change is 50. moving forward if you will provide a minus one option then what will happen let's see with maximum amount of days it will remove that it will not check for that validation hyphen M and if I will provide 1 and I will do again check and here you can see minus one it will like it will not check for the maximum number of days if you will use minus one but I don't want to use minus one I will simply use the 100 to keep things simple okay moving forward if you will use 0 in a small M like in minimum number of days it means the user can change the password anytime but if you but if you use some kind of number here then user can can change that person after that number of days if I'll use 0 then user can change the password anytime if he wants okay that is the main use of zero and but I will use 50 here okay now moving forward uh if you want to add the expiry date in your password like your password should expired after that certain number of days okay so how you can do it if I will use like this sudo foreign capital E and I will use the format as year 2022 uh 10 and 0 1. in the username okay and tomorrow my password will get expired and here you can see account expires it's on October 1 2020 two okay but password last password change this and password will expire when in January 2023 yeah it's a little bit like a logical thing but yes you can understand because we have not I have just used this expiry date like normally okay so moving forward if you want to use the warning like uh Suppose there are 100 is after 100 if possible get expired but you want to only use it before seven days then in that case you can use hyphen W option hyphen W and suppose we want to want the user before 10 days and here we got an error this is capital W set expiration warning days to one days okay sudo hyphen W10 yeah now done and here you can see number of days that is 10 as we have provided here okay so in this way you can change the expiry date minimum days of required to change the password password validation warning days you can do all the things with this particular command and also you can do same things with password command also but yeah if you don't want to change the password then you can use this command normally like you don't need to change the password again and again using password command okay so you have basically two commands to to this same thing that is password and this one what it was chhs okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it if you have any queries you can ask in the comment section and we will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you for watching
