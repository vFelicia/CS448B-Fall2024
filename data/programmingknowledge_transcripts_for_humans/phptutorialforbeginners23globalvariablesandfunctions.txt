00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use Global variable with
00:04 - your functions so what is a global
00:07 - variable a global variable by the name
00:10 - itself you can understand that Global
00:14 - variable is available everywhere in your
00:18 - program so whenever you declare a global
00:21 - variable it it should be uh or it can be
00:25 - used everywhere in the program right but
00:30 - uh whenever we try to use this Global
00:33 - variable inside our function it behaves
00:37 - little bit differently and I will show
00:41 - you how to use this Global variable with
00:43 - a function so for example I declare a
00:47 - variable called name for example and
00:52 - name I assign this name as Mark okay and
00:59 - I can just just
01:02 - Echo this name right this is
01:09 - simple but for example I want to make a
01:11 - function to the display name so I make a
01:16 - function
01:18 - function and I can
01:20 - say
01:22 - show
01:24 - name and this will be my
01:27 - function and I just want to display
01:30 - this name uh using this function so I
01:33 - just can say Echo and in single codes I
01:38 - can say the
01:40 - name of
01:44 - the student
01:47 - is
01:48 - and with this concatenation symbol I can
01:52 - use names like this okay and if
01:58 - you know that that by calling this
02:01 - function in here I will be able to show
02:05 - this message right so let me save it and
02:09 - let's see what is the result I'll just
02:12 - refresh this and I will call my global.
02:15 - PHP and in here you will be able to see
02:18 - that undefined
02:21 - name uh here and the name of the student
02:25 - is and you will not be able to see uh
02:28 - the name which we have assigned which is
02:31 - Mark right and why is this happening the
02:38 - name is not available uh you know
02:41 - whenever we want to see here name is not
02:44 - available ideally we should see the name
02:46 - of the student is marked because we are
02:49 - printing this name of the student is or
02:51 - whatever this uh name contains and we
02:55 - can just prove this that this name has
02:59 - the value of Mark by just echoing this
03:01 - like this so I will just save it and I
03:05 - will refresh this and you can see this
03:09 - name variable holds the value Mark but
03:13 - inside your function you will not be
03:15 - able to print this name and there is a
03:19 - small little uh line which you need to
03:23 - write to specify that this name is a
03:27 - global variable and you want to use this
03:30 - inside your function and you just need
03:33 - to add this line you just need to
03:38 - write Global and the name of your
03:43 - variable and once you specify that this
03:46 - name is a global variable so this is the
03:50 - same name as this name but now you
03:54 - specify in the function that this is a
03:57 - global variable and let's see what
04:00 - happens now I will refresh it and now I
04:04 - can see that the name of the student is
04:07 - Mark right so in order to use a global
04:11 - variable inside your function you need
04:15 - to specify that you want to use this
04:17 - Global variable and not just one Global
04:20 - variable you can just uh um use
04:25 - different Global variable name one
04:31 - comma name two so like this you can
04:35 - specify multiple Global variable inside
04:38 - a function and use them uh unless and
04:41 - until you have declared those names as a
04:44 - global variable outside these
04:47 - functions okay so just remember that
04:49 - whenever you want to use a
04:53 - global variable It This Global variable
04:56 - can be in other PHP file also and you
05:00 - may wish to uh you know declare all of
05:04 - your Global variable in one PHP file and
05:07 - you can call these uh Global variable
05:10 - inside your function in other files by
05:13 - just using this declaration that this
05:16 - variable is global and you want to use
05:18 - it okay so just remember this in your
05:22 - mind and you will be good to go so I
05:24 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
05:26 - wait comment and subscribe and bye for
05:27 - now

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use Global variable with your functions so what is a global variable a global variable by the name itself you can understand that Global variable is available everywhere in your program so whenever you declare a global variable it it should be uh or it can be used everywhere in the program right but uh whenever we try to use this Global variable inside our function it behaves little bit differently and I will show you how to use this Global variable with a function so for example I declare a variable called name for example and name I assign this name as Mark okay and I can just just Echo this name right this is simple but for example I want to make a function to the display name so I make a function function and I can say show name and this will be my function and I just want to display this name uh using this function so I just can say Echo and in single codes I can say the name of the student is and with this concatenation symbol I can use names like this okay and if you know that that by calling this function in here I will be able to show this message right so let me save it and let's see what is the result I'll just refresh this and I will call my global. PHP and in here you will be able to see that undefined name uh here and the name of the student is and you will not be able to see uh the name which we have assigned which is Mark right and why is this happening the name is not available uh you know whenever we want to see here name is not available ideally we should see the name of the student is marked because we are printing this name of the student is or whatever this uh name contains and we can just prove this that this name has the value of Mark by just echoing this like this so I will just save it and I will refresh this and you can see this name variable holds the value Mark but inside your function you will not be able to print this name and there is a small little uh line which you need to write to specify that this name is a global variable and you want to use this inside your function and you just need to add this line you just need to write Global and the name of your variable and once you specify that this name is a global variable so this is the same name as this name but now you specify in the function that this is a global variable and let's see what happens now I will refresh it and now I can see that the name of the student is Mark right so in order to use a global variable inside your function you need to specify that you want to use this Global variable and not just one Global variable you can just uh um use different Global variable name one comma name two so like this you can specify multiple Global variable inside a function and use them uh unless and until you have declared those names as a global variable outside these functions okay so just remember that whenever you want to use a global variable It This Global variable can be in other PHP file also and you may wish to uh you know declare all of your Global variable in one PHP file and you can call these uh Global variable inside your function in other files by just using this declaration that this variable is global and you want to use it okay so just remember this in your mind and you will be good to go so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
