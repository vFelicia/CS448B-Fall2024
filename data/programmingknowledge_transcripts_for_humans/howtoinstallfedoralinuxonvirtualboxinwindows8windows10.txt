00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:05 - install Fedora version 25 on Oracle
00:08 - VirtualBox so let's get started
00:11 - hopefully you have already installed
00:13 - Oracle VirtualBox on your Windows
00:17 - operating system I'm using Windows as my
00:20 - host but I think on other operating
00:22 - systems also the procedures will be the
00:25 - same right so just go to VirtualBox
00:30 - website and just download the executable
00:32 - file and the installation is really easy
00:36 - so I am NOT going to show you how to
00:38 - install VirtualBox just install
00:40 - VirtualBox and open VirtualBox for now
00:43 - okay now we are going to download the
00:46 - Fedora ISO file so just open your
00:50 - favorite browser and search for fedora
00:53 - and the first link which will appear
00:55 - here will be get fedora dot o-r-g so
00:59 - just click on the link and here on the
01:04 - Fedora website you have three options
01:06 - fedora workstation server and atomic we
01:11 - are interested in workstation so just
01:13 - just click on this section workstation
01:17 - section and here you will be able to see
01:21 - this kind of interface and here it says
01:24 - this is the Linux workstation and you
01:28 - have been waiting for so I will just
01:31 - click this download button which says
01:34 - download now now the little change the
01:38 - Fedora website has done here is in
01:42 - whenever you wanted to you know download
01:46 - and install Fedora 24 version for
01:48 - example the ISO file was available on
01:52 - here right in this you know green
01:56 - download button for example but recently
01:59 - I think Fedora has also the Windows
02:03 - version of executable file which we
02:07 - don't want right so we want fedora ISO
02:10 - file and this download button is
02:13 - going to give you that and what you need
02:16 - to do is you need to download this ISO
02:19 - file from here with say 64-bit 3.1 GB
02:24 - live image right so click on this link
02:27 - not on this ok so just click this link
02:31 - which is going to download fedora on
02:34 - your Windows operating system right
02:37 - which is the ISO file you can see fedora
02:40 - workstation Live 64 bits 3.1 ISO I have
02:45 - already downloaded it's a quite big file
02:48 - so you need to wait for the download so
02:50 - I have already downloaded this file on
02:53 - my operating system and this is the ISO
02:57 - file which I'm going to use and now I'm
03:00 - ready to you know create the virtual
03:02 - machine using this fedora so for that
03:07 - just open your VirtualBox manager and
03:10 - here we are going to create a new
03:12 - virtual machine you can see I have
03:14 - already have a different kind of
03:16 - operating system on VirtualBox and now I
03:20 - want to install Fedora also so just
03:22 - click this new button here and once you
03:27 - click this button it's going to give you
03:28 - the new virtual machine interface kind
03:32 - of thing and here create a virtual
03:36 - machine you need to give the name Fedora
03:39 - and VirtualBox is intelligent enough to
03:44 - recognize that if you type name Fedora
03:47 - here just type Fedora and the type
03:52 - automatically will be selected here will
03:55 - be Linux and it's going to automatically
03:57 - select the version Fedora 64-bit if it
04:01 - doesn't appear automatically you can
04:03 - just choose from here right so Fedora
04:06 - 64-bit and Linux and then click Next and
04:09 - this is the memory minimum memory it
04:12 - requires but we can give a little bit
04:16 - more memory to it for example 2 gigabyte
04:20 - of memory for example and click Next and
04:22 - here it says create our
04:26 - virtual hard drive now which we want so
04:30 - just leave it as default which is the
04:32 - second option and just click create okay
04:36 - this is going to give you this kind of
04:38 - interface just leave the first option
04:42 - you know enabled which is VDI format and
04:45 - then click Next and also here just leave
04:49 - the dynamically allocated memory here
04:53 - and just click Next and here you can
04:56 - provide the size or whatever you know
05:00 - size you want to give to your fedora
05:03 - fedora operating system it requires
05:05 - minimum 8gb but you can increase it to
05:08 - for example 20 GB or whatever you know
05:12 - memory you want to allocate hard disk
05:14 - you want to look it right and then click
05:16 - create and this is going to create this
05:20 - virtual machine but still it's not ready
05:23 - to use because we haven't provided the
05:25 - path for your you know ISO file in this
05:29 - virtual machine right so what you need
05:31 - to do next is just click Fedora and
05:34 - select Fedora from here and then click
05:37 - settings here or otherwise you can right
05:39 - click on Fedora and click settings from
05:41 - here also
05:42 - both will open the settings option for
05:45 - the Fedora virtual machine and here you
05:49 - can change some of the settings related
05:51 - to Fedora so what we want to do here is
05:54 - we want to go to systems and here you
05:58 - can see we have allocated 2 GB which is
06:01 - fine but if you want to provide the more
06:04 - processor by default VirtualBox provide
06:07 - the one CPU for your virtual machine but
06:11 - you can increase it from here for
06:12 - example I want to use two or three or
06:15 - four processors right so for now I want
06:18 - to use two ok and here leave it as
06:22 - default next option is display people
06:25 - don't want to change anything in there
06:27 - and the next option is here which says
06:31 - sis storage right and in the storage
06:34 - what we want to do is we want to provide
06:39 - the
06:39 - location of our ISO file so just select
06:42 - storage and go to controller select
06:45 - empty right select empty and on the
06:48 - right hand side you will be able to see
06:49 - this kind of interface just select the
06:52 - CD icon which is on the right hand side
06:56 - and then click choose virtual CD disc
07:00 - file ok so just click here and then copy
07:04 - the location wherever you have saved
07:06 - your ISO file fedora ISO file and then
07:09 - you know provide this location from here
07:12 - and choose the ISO file which you have
07:15 - downloaded and click open and this is
07:18 - going to provide the path for your ISO
07:20 - file right and here one of the important
07:25 - option in general is you can see here
07:27 - that if you want to copy and paste
07:31 - content from your for example Windows
07:33 - host machine to your Fred or machine go
07:37 - to general and go to advanced and here
07:40 - you just need to enable bidirectional
07:43 - for shared clipboard and drag-drop
07:46 - bi-directional so choose these two
07:47 - options bi-directional and click OK now
07:51 - we are ready to start our installation
07:53 - for fedora so just select fedora and
07:55 - click start and this is going to start
07:58 - the installation for the fedora for the
