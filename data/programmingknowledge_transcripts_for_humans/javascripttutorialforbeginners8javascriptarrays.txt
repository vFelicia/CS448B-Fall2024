00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how to use arrays
00:07 - in JavaScript now first of all what is
00:11 - an array an array is a variable which is
00:15 - capable of storing more than one value
00:19 - okay so using array you can store
00:23 - multiple value in a variable now let's
00:26 - see how we can declare an array in
00:30 - JavaScript so you use VAR to declare an
00:33 - array as any other variable and then the
00:36 - name of a variable for example we want
00:39 - the collection of name or multiple names
00:42 - in a variable and then you use these
00:46 - square bracket to declare them and for
00:49 - example I'm going to add some names here
00:52 - something like this so This array name
00:56 - has four names inside it so it's storing
00:59 - four different names right now to access
01:02 - this array for example you want to
01:05 - access uh the first element of this
01:08 - array how you can do it so what I'm
01:10 - going to do here is I'm going to just uh
01:13 - print this value using document. getet
01:16 - element by ID and I have this uh
01:19 - paragraph tag here whose ID is demo
01:22 - which I'm calling here do inner HTML is
01:26 - equal to and for example I want to print
01:29 - the whole array so I can just call this
01:33 - like this okay and save your code and
01:37 - refresh it and you will see here all the
01:40 - names printed on the web page right so
01:44 - arrays has some indexes and indexes is
01:48 - nothing but the position at which the
01:50 - value is stored and this value starts
01:53 - from zero in the case of array so this
01:57 - position of uh the first value is zero
02:01 - index because the index start from zero
02:03 - so the index of Tom is zero John is one
02:07 - and Bill is two and Mark is three right
02:10 - so for example I want to access this
02:13 - name John so I can just write here name
02:16 - and then in the square bracket one and
02:19 - one is the index here okay and save your
02:22 - code and refresh it it's printing John
02:26 - now for example I want to access this uh
02:28 - name Tom here the index of it is zero
02:32 - okay and just save it and refresh it and
02:35 - then it will give you Tom right so
02:38 - indexes in Array start from zero now if
02:42 - you want to change some item at some
02:44 - index what you can do here is you can
02:47 - just call the name of your array and
02:49 - then the index on which you want to
02:51 - change so for example I want to change
02:54 - this uh name Tom and I want to make this
02:57 - name starting with capital T not with
03:00 - small T so I will just use name zero and
03:05 - then is equal to the new name right so
03:09 - the new name is Tom with the capital T
03:13 - right and let just save your uh code and
03:16 - now refresh it and now you can see the
03:19 - name becomes Tom with capital T right
03:24 - now using this uh method you can also
03:27 - add some items to the array so right now
03:30 - I have four items in my array and the
03:33 - index of uh these items are 0 1 2 3 so I
03:37 - can add at the fourth place an item so I
03:41 - can just write four and in here I can
03:44 - add a new item so something like this
03:48 - and then I can print my array something
03:51 - like this save your code and refresh it
03:54 - and now my array has five items in it
03:58 - now there is one more more way of uh
04:01 - pushing element in the array so for
04:05 - example you want to add one more item in
04:07 - the names so you can use names dot push
04:12 - and then you can just add another new
04:15 - name so for example some new name
04:18 - something like this okay and then save
04:21 - your code and refresh your web page and
04:24 - now you can see one more item is added
04:27 - to your array so you can use push or
04:32 - using this index method to add to an
04:36 - array now there are some method
04:38 - associated with arrays which you can use
04:41 - to use the arrays now for example I want
04:45 - to know how many number of elements are
04:50 - contained inside the array so I can use
04:53 - a method called the length so just use
04:57 - the name of the array which is names in
04:59 - my case case then use Dot and then call
05:02 - length method on it and then it will
05:06 - give you the number of elements inside
05:09 - the array right so save your code and
05:12 - refresh it and it says six which is true
05:16 - because these are four names and these
05:18 - two names we have pushed outside the
05:21 - array right now there is one more method
05:24 - you which you can call on the array
05:27 - which is called sort and this will sort
05:30 - all the element in the array for example
05:33 - you have names here so it will uh sort
05:36 - the names according to the alphabetical
05:40 - order right so save your code and
05:43 - refresh it and now you can see these
05:46 - names are sorted in alphabetical order
05:48 - so B first and then J then M then T
05:53 - right now it's not necessary that array
05:55 - must have the elements of same data
05:58 - types so for for example I want uh
06:01 - strings and integer in my array it's
06:03 - totally valid so for example I'm going
06:06 - to delete this name and instead of this
06:08 - name I'm going to add this integer 500
06:11 - right and save my code and refresh my
06:14 - web page and it's going to add this
06:16 - integer to the array and it's no problem
06:21 - right now there is a different way of
06:24 - declaring an array also and which is
06:27 - something like this so V
06:30 - name one for example is equal to
06:35 - new array and then in the brackets you
06:38 - can provide the elements okay so for
06:41 - example I can just copy this and paste
06:45 - it here and it's totally valid okay and
06:49 - I'm going to declare it above here and
06:52 - I'm going to call this name one here and
06:55 - save it and refresh my web web page and
06:58 - it's going to to give me the same result
07:01 - as we have seen earlier okay now you can
07:03 - use some more examples with arrays for
07:06 - example I will delete this array
07:09 - declaration and uh this also and I will
07:13 - use this uh
07:15 - name and I will call a method called pop
07:19 - okay and what this method does is it
07:22 - removes the last element from the array
07:25 - okay so I will just call this array here
07:29 - and save my code and refresh it and you
07:32 - can see I only have three elements in
07:34 - the array fourth is removed okay now if
07:38 - you want to remove the first element
07:40 - from the array you call a method called
07:43 - shift here okay and it's going to remove
07:46 - the first element from the array so
07:49 - let's save it and uh refresh the web
07:51 - page and now you can see the first
07:54 - element Tom is removed and the second
07:56 - third and fourth elements are here okay
07:59 - okay now if you want to add some element
08:01 - to the first place for example at index
08:05 - 0o you can use unshift method so just
08:09 - write names. unshift and then you can
08:12 - add the value here for
08:15 - example Ben and then save your code and
08:18 - refresh the web page and now you can see
08:21 - at the zeroth index this name is added
08:25 - so in this way you can use arrays in
08:27 - JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use arrays in JavaScript now first of all what is an array an array is a variable which is

going to add some names here something like this so This array name has four names inside it so it's storing four different names right now to access this array for example you want to access uh the first element of this array how you can do it so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to just uh print this value using document. getet element by ID and I have this uh paragraph tag here whose ID is demo which I'm calling here do inner HTML is equal to and for example I want to print the whole array so I can just call this like this okay and save your code and refresh it and you will see here all the names printed on the web page right so arrays has some indexes and indexes is nothing but the position at which the value is stored and this value starts from zero in the case of array so this position of uh the first value is zero index because the index start from zero so the index of Tom is zero John is one and Bill is two and Mark is three right so for example I want to access this name John so I can just write here name and then in the square bracket one and one is the index here okay and save your code and refresh it it's printing John now for example I want to access this uh name Tom here the index of it is zero okay and just save it and refresh it and then it will give you Tom right so indexes in Array start from zero now if you want to change some item at some index what you can do here is you can just call the name of your array and then the index on which you want to change so for example I want to change this uh name Tom and I want to make this name starting with capital T not with small T so I will just use name zero and then is equal to the new name right so the new name is Tom with the capital T right and let just save your uh code and now refresh it and now you can see the name becomes Tom with capital T right now using this uh method you can also add some items to the array so right now I have four items in my array and the index of uh these items are 0 1 2 3 so I can add at the fourth place an item so I can just write four and in here I can add a new item so something like this and then I can print my array something like this save your code and refresh it and now my array has five items in it now there is one more more way of uh pushing element in the array so for example you want to add one more item in the names so you can use names dot push and then you can just add another new name so for example some new name something like this okay and then save your code and refresh your web page and now you can see one more item is added to your array so you can use push or using this index method to add to an array now there are some method associated with arrays which you can use to use the arrays now for example I want to know how many number of elements are contained inside the array so I can use a method called the length so just use the name of the array which is names in my case case then use Dot and then call length method on it and then it will give you the number of elements inside the array right so save your code and refresh it and it says six which is true because these are four names and these two names we have pushed outside the array right now there is one more method you which you can call on the array which is called sort and this will sort all the element in the array for example you have names here so it will uh sort the names according to the alphabetical order right so save your code and refresh it and now you can see these names are sorted in alphabetical order so B first and then J then M then T right now it's not necessary that array must have the elements of same data types so for for example I want uh strings and integer in my array it's totally valid so for example I'm going to delete this name and instead of this name I'm going to add this integer 500 right and save my code and refresh my web page and it's going to add this integer to the array and it's no problem right now there is a different way of declaring an array also and which is something like this so V name one for example is equal to new array and then in the brackets you can provide the elements okay so for example I can just copy this and paste it here and it's totally valid okay and I'm going to declare it above here and I'm going to call this name one here and save it and refresh my web web page and it's going to to give me the same result as we have seen earlier okay now you can use some more examples with arrays for example I will delete this array declaration and uh this also and I will use this uh name and I will call a method called pop okay and what this method does is it removes the last element from the array okay so I will just call this array here and save my code and refresh it and you can see I only have three elements in the array fourth is removed okay now if you want to remove the first element from the array you call a method called shift here okay and it's going to remove the first element from the array so let's save it and uh refresh the web page and now you can see the first element Tom is removed and the second third and fourth elements are here okay okay now if you want to add some element to the first place for example at index 0o you can use unshift method so just write names. unshift and then you can add the value here for example Ben and then save your code and refresh the web page and now you can see at the zeroth index this name is added so in this way you can use arrays in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and
