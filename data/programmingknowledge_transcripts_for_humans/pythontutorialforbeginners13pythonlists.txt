00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:06 - lists in Python so first of all what are
00:10 - lists so list in Python is a kind of
00:14 - collection which allows us to put many
00:18 - values in a single variable you can also
00:22 - say that list is an ordered set of
00:25 - values so let's define a list so I'm
00:29 - going to just say X is equal to and you
00:32 - can define a list inside these square
00:35 - brackets and inside the list you provide
00:37 - some values so for example I'm going to
00:39 - provide the values 3 comma 5 comma 4
00:44 - comma 9 comma 7 comma 10 so this is how
00:48 - you can create a list in Python and when
00:51 - I press ENTER it's going to create a
00:53 - list and when I just use X to get the
00:57 - list is going to provide me all the
01:00 - values in the list now these values
01:02 - which are inside the list are called
01:05 - elements so 3 is an element or 5 is an
01:08 - element or all these values in this list
01:11 - are all called elements and all these
01:14 - elements are ordered by their index now
01:18 - index as I already said in the previous
01:20 - videos also always starts from 0 so we
01:25 - can fetch the value which is at index 0
01:29 - using the square bracket once again with
01:32 - a variable name and then when I write
01:35 - index 0 it's going to give me the
01:38 - element which is saved at index 0 so
01:42 - looking at this list 3 is at index 0 5
01:47 - is at index 1 4 is at index 2 and so on
01:52 - so let's say I want to get the value
01:55 - which is at index 4 0 1 2 3 4 so I'm
02:01 - going to just write X square bracket 4
02:05 - and it is going to give me 7 which is
02:07 - saved at index 4 now it's not necessary
02:10 - that list must contain all the same
02:13 - data-type elements so for example I can
02:16 - also declare a variable called Y and in
02:19 - this I can save some name for example
02:22 - max I can save integer let's say 1 I can
02:28 - save a decimal value let's say 15 point
02:31 - 5 I can save other lists inside this
02:34 - list using these square brackets for
02:37 - example 3 comma 2 so one list can
02:39 - contain different type of data types
02:41 - with any number of elements so when I
02:44 - press ENTER and this time I want to get
02:47 - the value which is at index 0 it's going
02:51 - to give me max and once I want to get
02:54 - the value which is saved at index 3 then
02:58 - it's going to give me this list which I
03:01 - have saved at index 3 now when you try
03:04 - to access the index which is not there
03:07 - so I'm going to just write Y and then
03:10 - I'm going to say hundred and this value
03:14 - is not present in this list at this
03:16 - index so I'm going to press ENTER and
03:18 - it's going to give me the error which
03:21 - says list index out of range now if you
03:24 - want to get the length of the list you
03:26 - can use the inbuilt function in Python
03:29 - which is le n and then your list name so
03:32 - for example I want to find out the
03:34 - length of list X it's going to give me 6
03:38 - it's going to give me 6 because you can
03:41 - see here this list contains 6 elements
03:44 - or I want to get the length of the
03:46 - second list which is why it's going to
03:49 - give us 4 because this list contain 4
03:52 - elements now it's also possible to
03:54 - insert and remove elements from the list
03:57 - so for example I'm going to use X which
04:00 - has 6 element till now and I'm going to
04:03 - insert the 7th element so I can use a
04:05 - method called insert and you can see
04:08 - this method takes an index and the
04:12 - object name so I'm going to choose this
04:13 - and the index at which I want to insert
04:16 - the value is at index 2 and the value I
04:20 - want to insert is some string for
04:22 - example Tom and I'm going to press Enter
04:26 - I'm going to print the values inside the
04:28 - X list then you can see now this list
04:33 - has seven elements and Tom is inserted
04:36 - at the index to because we have inserted
04:39 - this value at the index two in a similar
04:43 - way you can remove something from a list
04:44 - also so to remove something you can use
04:47 - your variable name for example X dot
04:50 - remove and the value you want to remove
04:53 - so for example once again I want to
04:56 - remove this name which I have inserted
04:57 - at index two and once again when I print
05:01 - the value of X it's going to give me
05:03 - these values now let's say the list
05:06 - contains two element which are exactly
05:10 - the same so I'm going to insert one more
05:12 - element at index one and this element
05:16 - will be three for example and now my
05:18 - list contain double three here and if I
05:21 - want to remove this three so I'm going
05:23 - to just call this remove function once
05:26 - again and I will say three here and then
05:28 - press Enter
05:29 - you can see only one three is removed
05:31 - from this list so you can see these
05:34 - three are at index zero and index one so
05:37 - this value is removed which is at index
05:40 - zero and this will remain in this list
05:44 - so if a list contains duplicate values
05:47 - is going to remove the value from the
05:50 - left and also remove is going to remove
05:52 - only one object which is found first in
05:56 - the list now if you try to remove the
05:58 - element which is not there in the list
06:00 - so I'm going to remove something which
06:03 - is not even there in this list then it's
06:05 - going to give us this error it says that
06:08 - this is a value error and it cannot
06:11 - remove this value from the list now
06:13 - there is one more function with the list
06:16 - which is a pop method and this we can
06:19 - use to remove the values from the last
06:21 - so you can see our list was previously
06:24 - having six elements and ten was the last
06:28 - element and when you use this function
06:31 - which is pop it's going to pop this ten
06:34 - from the list and now let's see the
06:36 - content of the list so now this list
06:39 - contain only if
06:40 - five element and the last element is now
06:43 - removed once again when you use this pop
06:45 - method it's going to remove the seven
06:47 - and now our list only contains four
06:51 - elements now let's say you want to
06:53 - delete the whole list so I'm going to
06:55 - declare a list and this list will
06:58 - contain a few values and then I will
07:01 - press enter and you can see the level
07:03 - use of list and now I can use a function
07:05 - called de L and then the name of the
07:09 - list and this function is going to
07:10 - delete this list so I'm going to just
07:13 - press ENTER and then once again try to
07:15 - access the values inside this variable
07:18 - and now it says the name Z is not
07:22 - defined because delete function has
07:24 - deleted this list now once again I'm
07:26 - going to create this list Z and now
07:29 - there is a function called clear which
07:31 - is used to remove all the values from
07:34 - the list so I'm going to just press
07:37 - ENTER and then try to access the value
07:39 - of Z and you can see this list is now
07:42 - empty because we have used the clear
07:45 - function which is used to empty the list
07:47 - let me show you a few more functions
07:49 - related to lists so let's say I can use
07:52 - X and the values inside X are 3 5 4 9
07:56 - and I can use a function called sort to
08:00 - sort all these integer values inside the
08:03 - list and once I press enter now now you
08:06 - can see all the values are sorted and
08:09 - you can see all the values are sorted in
08:11 - ascending order you can also use this
08:14 - method X dot reverse and it's going to
08:18 - reverse all the values so once I use the
08:21 - reverse function and then when I try to
08:24 - get all the values inside the list you
08:26 - can see all the values are now reversed
08:28 - there is also a function called append
08:31 - and here you can append anything to your
08:34 - list so I'm going to append 10 to my
08:36 - list and when I try to access this list
08:39 - you can see at last this 10 is appended
08:43 - in my list also if you want to copy one
08:45 - list into another you can use let's say
08:48 - I'm going to declare a variable called s
08:51 - here and
08:53 - want to copy all the values from X list
08:56 - I can use X dot copy and this is going
09:01 - to copy all the content of my X list
09:03 - into this new variable called s so you
09:07 - can see all the values are copied into
09:10 - the variable s so let me append
09:12 - something into my list once again so I'm
09:15 - going to append tenmonths again and now
09:17 - my list looks like this and there is a
09:19 - function called count using which you
09:23 - can count the number of element which
09:26 - are there in the list so I want to find
09:28 - how many number of 10 are there in the
09:31 - list is going to return me to and once
09:35 - again I want to count how many threes
09:37 - are there in the list it's going to
09:39 - return me 1 let's say I want to count
09:41 - how many hundreds are there in my list
09:43 - and it's going to return zero so this is
09:45 - how you can use lists in Python you can
09:49 - also use the list name and then dot and
09:52 - see all the methods which are available
09:54 - related to list here and you can use
09:57 - these method which you see here so I
10:00 - hope you have enjoyed this video and I
10:03 - will see you in the next video

hey guys welcome to the next video on python tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how to use lists in Python so first of all what are lists so list in Python is a kind of collection which allows us to put many values in a single variable you can also say that list is an ordered set of values so let's define a list so I'm going to just say X is equal to and you can define a list inside these square brackets and inside the list you provide some values so for example I'm going to provide the values 3 comma 5 comma 4 comma 9 comma 7 comma 10 so this is how you can create a list in Python and when I press ENTER it's going to create a list and when I just use X to get the list is going to provide me all the values in the list now these values which are inside the list are called elements so 3 is an element or 5 is an element or all these values in this list are all called elements and all these elements are ordered by their index now index as I already said in the previous videos also always starts from 0 so we can fetch the value which is at index 0 using the square bracket once again with a variable name and then when I write index 0 it's going to give me the element which is saved at index 0 so looking at this list 3 is at index 0 5 is at index 1 4 is at index 2 and so on so let's say I want to get the value which is at index 4 0 1 2 3 4 so I'm going to just write X square bracket 4 and it is going to give me 7 which is saved at index 4 now it's not necessary that list must contain all the same datatype elements so for example I can also declare a variable called Y and in this I can save some name for example max I can save integer let's say 1 I can save a decimal value let's say 15 point 5 I can save other lists inside this list using these square brackets for example 3 comma 2 so one list can contain different type of data types with any number of elements so when I press ENTER and this time I want to get the value which is at index 0 it's going to give me max and once I want to get the value which is saved at index 3 then it's going to give me this list which I have saved at index 3 now when you try to access the index which is not there so I'm going to just write Y and then I'm going to say hundred and this value is not present in this list at this index so I'm going to press ENTER and it's going to give me the error which says list index out of range now if you want to get the length of the list you can use the inbuilt function in Python which is le n and then your list name so for example I want to find out the length of list X it's going to give me 6 it's going to give me 6 because you can see here this list contains 6 elements or I want to get the length of the second list which is why it's going to give us 4 because this list contain 4 elements now it's also possible to insert and remove elements from the list so for example I'm going to use X which has 6 element till now and I'm going to insert the 7th element so I can use a method called insert and you can see this method takes an index and the object name so I'm going to choose this and the index at which I want to insert the value is at index 2 and the value I want to insert is some string for example Tom and I'm going to press Enter I'm going to print the values inside the X list then you can see now this list has seven elements and Tom is inserted at the index to because we have inserted this value at the index two in a similar way you can remove something from a list also so to remove something you can use your variable name for example X dot remove and the value you want to remove so for example once again I want to remove this name which I have inserted at index two and once again when I print the value of X it's going to give me these values now let's say the list contains two element which are exactly the same so I'm going to insert one more element at index one and this element will be three for example and now my list contain double three here and if I want to remove this three so I'm going to just call this remove function once again and I will say three here and then press Enter you can see only one three is removed from this list so you can see these three are at index zero and index one so this value is removed which is at index zero and this will remain in this list so if a list contains duplicate values is going to remove the value from the left and also remove is going to remove only one object which is found first in the list now if you try to remove the element which is not there in the list so I'm going to remove something which is not even there in this list then it's going to give us this error it says that this is a value error and it cannot remove this value from the list now there is one more function with the list which is a pop method and this we can use to remove the values from the last so you can see our list was previously having six elements and ten was the last element and when you use this function which is pop it's going to pop this ten from the list and now let's see the content of the list so now this list contain only if five element and the last element is now removed once again when you use this pop method it's going to remove the seven and now our list only contains four elements now let's say you want to delete the whole list so I'm going to declare a list and this list will contain a few values and then I will press enter and you can see the level use of list and now I can use a function called de L and then the name of the list and this function is going to delete this list so I'm going to just press ENTER and then once again try to access the values inside this variable and now it says the name Z is not defined because delete function has deleted this list now once again I'm going to create this list Z and now there is a function called clear which is used to remove all the values from the list so I'm going to just press ENTER and then try to access the value of Z and you can see this list is now empty because we have used the clear function which is used to empty the list let me show you a few more functions related to lists so let's say I can use X and the values inside X are 3 5 4 9 and I can use a function called sort to sort all these integer values inside the list and once I press enter now now you can see all the values are sorted and you can see all the values are sorted in ascending order you can also use this method X dot reverse and it's going to reverse all the values so once I use the reverse function and then when I try to get all the values inside the list you can see all the values are now reversed there is also a function called append and here you can append anything to your list so I'm going to append 10 to my list and when I try to access this list you can see at last this 10 is appended in my list also if you want to copy one list into another you can use let's say I'm going to declare a variable called s here and want to copy all the values from X list I can use X dot copy and this is going to copy all the content of my X list into this new variable called s so you can see all the values are copied into the variable s so let me append something into my list once again so I'm going to append tenmonths again and now my list looks like this and there is a function called count using which you can count the number of element which are there in the list so I want to find how many number of 10 are there in the list is going to return me to and once again I want to count how many threes are there in the list it's going to return me 1 let's say I want to count how many hundreds are there in my list and it's going to return zero so this is how you can use lists in Python you can also use the list name and then dot and see all the methods which are available related to list here and you can use these method which you see here so I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
