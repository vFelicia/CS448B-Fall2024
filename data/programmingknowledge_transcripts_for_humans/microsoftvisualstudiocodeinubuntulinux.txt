00:00 - hello guys Microsoft has recently
00:02 - announced their new code editor called
00:05 - Visual Studio code for building and
00:08 - debugging modern web and Cloud
00:11 - applications and the most interesting
00:14 - thing about this code editor is it's a
00:16 - crossplatform
00:18 - um code editor which can be used on
00:22 - Linux Mac OS or Windows and in this
00:25 - video we are going to uh download it on
00:29 - our Linux operating system and see how
00:32 - it works uh Linux operating system
00:35 - already have uh good code editors like
00:38 - whm or emac and some other code editors
00:42 - but the learning curve of these uh code
00:45 - editor which are already there on Linux
00:47 - are really steep so it's not easy to
00:51 - learn and to master them so let's see
00:55 - how easy it is to uh use Visual Studio
00:59 - code
01:00 - so you can download the preview of this
01:03 - video Visual Studio code by going to the
01:06 - visual studio.com website I'm going to
01:09 - uh put the link in the description for
01:11 - the download and you can see I can see
01:14 - this download button for uh Linux so I'm
01:18 - going to just click this and once you
01:20 - click this you are going to uh download
01:23 - uh ZIP file which will look like this vs
01:27 - code minus Linux minus X 64. zip file so
01:32 - just download it and then extract it
01:34 - wherever you want so once it's extracted
01:38 - we are going to go to the folder and
01:42 - what we need to do is we just need to
01:44 - click this code binary so just double
01:48 - click it and it's going to open this
01:50 - Visual Studio code so now uh this uh
01:54 - code editor or Visual Studio code is
01:57 - open and you can see see it's a simple
02:00 - code editor which have some really uh
02:05 - strong features like quick open by
02:09 - pressing control o or contr control Tab
02:13 - and then it has the feature that you can
02:16 - open multiple uh tabs side by side so
02:19 - that you can evaluate your uh code and
02:23 - you can even organize your files by
02:26 - double clicking and uh the last thing is
02:30 - control shift p so when you uh press
02:33 - control shift p it's going to give you
02:35 - all the command pallets or uh debugging
02:40 - options whatever are present or whatever
02:43 - is catered by this uh code editor so
02:47 - what we are going to do is we are going
02:49 - to create a
02:51 - new HTML file for example so it's
02:55 - Untitled so we are going to title it as
03:01 - and it has created me this HTML file and
03:03 - now let's uh write some code to check
03:06 - how it works so I'm going to add first
03:11 - HTML tag and you can see the
03:14 - intelligence it's really quick and for
03:18 - example I'm going to add the
03:21 - head now and when you
03:24 - press this it autoc completes right and
03:29 - for examp example let's add the body
03:32 - also
03:34 - body and it autoc completes so it can
03:37 - make your uh you know uh editing and
03:41 - programming really fast right let's add
03:44 - some paragraph
03:47 - here and let's uh try to add uh some uh
03:51 - CSS content here so let's start add
03:55 - style it's really fast so intelligence
03:58 - is really good here here right now let's
04:02 - add some style to the background
04:05 - so I'm going to add background color so
04:10 - and it gives me so many options by
04:14 - intellisense and background color this
04:17 - is the most uh interesting thing I uh
04:20 - liked about this is when I select some
04:23 - color the color also appears what I'm
04:27 - going to select so for example examp I'm
04:30 - going to select red the color appears
04:32 - here or some other colors for
04:36 - example
04:38 - blue you can see the color appearing
04:41 - here itself right so this you can do and
04:46 - for example I want to change some
04:49 - properties of the paragraph I can do
04:57 - it so you can see it's uh really quick
05:00 - uh it gives all the intelligence and
05:02 - everything right and let's try to uh
05:06 - click control shift p now so control
05:09 - shift p and it's going to give you all
05:12 - the commands available uh for the use
05:16 - for editing your code you can see here
05:19 - and it has the integration with Git also
05:22 - if you are using git now when you uh
05:25 - click this button here you can uh open
05:30 - the folder Explorer and close the folder
05:33 - Explorer by just clicking this op folder
05:35 - option right so let's uh collapse this
05:39 - folder Explorer for now and it has a
05:43 - nice formatting option also for example
05:46 - I mess up my code and I want to format
05:51 - my code now so I can right click and I
05:54 - can just click format code and it's
05:57 - going to format my code also
06:00 - right and now uh the other interesting
06:04 - uh option here is you can open the
06:07 - single file in multiple editors so I can
06:10 - just click this button and it's going to
06:13 - open my same file in multiple editors
06:16 - here
06:18 - right and there are some other nice
06:22 - features which uh you can explore by
06:26 - using this code editor for example you
06:29 - want to zoom in or zoom out you can set
06:32 - the shortcut for this and you can zoom
06:34 - in or zoom out your code like this okay
06:38 - so
06:39 - zoom in and zoom
06:43 - out and uh for now they support asp.net
06:48 - 5 and developing nodejs so if you
06:52 - require some help you can just click
06:54 - this option and it's going to open
06:57 - you this help how you can set up your
07:01 - node application on this Visual Studio
07:03 - code and you can read this and make your
07:07 - own uh make your own uh uh nodejs
07:11 - application using this code right and uh
07:15 - if you like it or if you don't like it
07:17 - you can give your feedback by just

07:23 - here you can just give your feedback
07:26 - from here and send it to Microsoft and
07:29 - and they're going to look at it so
07:32 - that's it you can explore this uh Visual
07:34 - Studio code editor by yourself and see
07:37 - if it fits your requirements or not I
