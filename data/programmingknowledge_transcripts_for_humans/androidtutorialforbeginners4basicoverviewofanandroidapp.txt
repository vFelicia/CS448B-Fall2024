00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:05 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:08 - the basic overview of an Android app so
00:12 - in the last few video we have
00:14 - successfully created our first Android
00:17 - application and we would be able to run
00:20 - or we were able to run our first uh
00:23 - Android app on an Android
00:27 - emulator now for the first time when you
00:30 - see uh an Android app project it will
00:33 - look like this but what is what in this
00:37 - uh uh in this project for example this
00:40 - screen you see here is called an
00:44 - activity and the formal definition of an
00:47 - activity is an activity is a single
00:50 - focused thing that the user can do or in
00:55 - a simple terms you can say an activity
00:57 - is a screen which user interact
01:01 - with and an Android app can contain many
01:06 - activities uh in
01:08 - itself now where are these activities
01:11 - stored so when you go to your project
01:15 - overview here you can see three uh
01:20 - categories one is the project itself
01:22 - it's a broad project overview and this
01:26 - is what uh are the files and folders
01:30 - your project can contain right so it can
01:34 - contain the IDE files your app files
01:37 - gradal files and other uh files uh which
01:42 - your Android Studio needs to compile
01:45 - them the second overview when you go to
01:49 - the project overview is the package and
01:52 - these are the packages your app is using
01:55 - uh when uh you created your app but but
02:00 - the most important uh while developing
02:03 - your Android app is the Android category
02:06 - itself and this is where all your um you
02:09 - know programmable files are there and
02:13 - design of this activities are now this
02:19 - activity is just overview but behind
02:23 - this there is an XML file so when you go
02:27 - to your app and inside this app app
02:30 - there is a folder called Rees or res
02:32 - folder and inside this uh res folder
02:36 - there are uh some folders like drawable
02:41 - which contains some PNG files and
02:46 - your main activity or activity file is
02:50 - this one which is activity main.xml file
02:54 - other files are menu files which we we
02:56 - will see later and the next category is
03:00 - values category that also we will see
03:03 - later but right now the main important
03:07 - uh design uh XML file is this one so the
03:11 - XML file behind this uh uh screen is
03:16 - this main activity file or main
03:19 - activity uh XML file so you can uh click
03:23 - or you can open this XML file by
03:26 - clicking this text uh C category here so
03:31 - this is your design category of your uh
03:36 - activity and when you click here in the
03:39 - text it will open an XML file and this
03:43 - XML
03:44 - file is the
03:46 - main you know XML file which uh is
03:51 - responsible for the design of your uh uh
03:55 - Android right Android
03:58 - activity so
04:00 - what we can do is we can go to design
04:03 - and we can
04:06 - um delete this for now for example this
04:09 - one so you just uh select this and
04:11 - delete this and then what you can do
04:16 - is you can uh drag and drop these pallet
04:21 - widgets in your activity so there are so
04:25 - many uh widgets in here layouts text
04:30 - fields and other designable tools so you
04:35 - can drag and drop these tools and design
04:37 - your activity for example uh I can just
04:41 - drag and drop from this widgets the
04:44 - large text here and in here just double
04:48 - click it and you can just uh write
04:51 - anything here for
04:55 - example
04:58 - programming knowledge okay and then this
05:02 - will be displayed here
05:04 - and this Android Studio assist you to
05:08 - you know align your Widgets or Tools in
05:12 - your activity so you will be able to see
05:15 - this um message here right
05:20 - now once I have done that there is a
05:23 - text view added to my XML file and you
05:29 - see I have written uh this text on my
05:33 - text view which is programming knowledge
05:34 - and this is automatically added to your
05:38 - XML file also right I can addit my uh
05:42 - XML file and it can be addited to this
05:45 - view also for example programming
05:48 - knowledge uh YouTube and it will be
05:52 - added to your activity here so you can
05:57 - uh add this from here also text and from
06:00 - here also you can add more properties to
06:04 - your text view for example you can go to
06:06 - the design and you can change the these
06:11 - properties from here also so there are
06:14 - so many properties for example I want to
06:16 - change the background color of uh my uh
06:20 - this text view so I can just select this
06:24 - and then go to the properties and search
06:27 - for the property called background it's
06:29 - respons responsible for the background
06:30 - color of your property and go to the
06:33 - color and here I can choose any color
06:36 - for my text view for example green color
06:39 - I will click uh choose my color and here
06:43 - is the result of the color so this is
06:46 - ff3
06:47 - f1c so when I click okay the color will
06:51 - change and when I go to the text area it
06:54 - is the same background color which is f
06:58 - F3 FF F
07:01 - f1c which was the color we Cho we have
07:04 - chosen
07:05 - right the other thing is uh you can even
07:10 - change the color of your background
07:12 - color or properties of your main
07:15 - activity screen which is this one or
07:18 - layout you can just go to uh the
07:21 - background and just choose the
07:24 - color and choose any other color for
07:26 - example this blue color okay and it
07:29 - changes to the blue color okay
07:34 - now this is just a design part of your
07:38 - Android app but the main brain or you
07:41 - can say main uh you know actions are
07:44 - taken in the folder called Java and in
07:48 - here there is a uh Java class or Java
07:52 - file called main activity just open this
07:56 - and this is the class which is
07:58 - responsible for all the main actions of
08:03 - your app so for example you go to your
08:07 - main activity and you add some button
08:10 - here and you click this button all the
08:12 - code for clicking this button and
08:15 - whatever action uh will take while
08:19 - clicking this button will be written
08:22 - here so this is just a Java class which
08:26 - extends or inherits the bar activity
08:30 - class so this is our class uh which
08:33 - Android Studio have created for us and
08:36 - it
08:37 - extends so if you don't have uh much
08:40 - experience in Java programming I will
08:43 - recommend uh you can see my Java
08:45 - programming tutorial and you will be
08:47 - able to uh understand what this extend
08:50 - means but um simply this uh is
08:53 - inheriting for from this class and in
08:57 - here there are some
08:59 - already pre-created method which Android
09:03 - Studio have created for us for the first
09:06 - time so that our app can
09:09 - launch okay and this these codes we will
09:14 - see in uh the further videos what is the
09:17 - meaning of all these code behind so that
09:22 - we will understand uh more about uh what
09:25 - they are doing okay but this is the main
09:28 - you you know uh main logic of your
09:32 - Android app uh where you will write the
09:35 - logic of your Android app okay so these
09:40 - this is the basic overview of an Android
09:43 - app or there is one more uh interesting
09:46 - folder in this app called manifest okay
09:50 - so this is the folder called manifest
09:53 - and this uh contains the file called
09:57 - Android manifest do
09:59 - XML and this contains all the activity
10:03 - uh of activities of your Android app so
10:08 - for example our Android app right now
10:11 - contains only one activity which is this
10:13 - one and so this activity is you know uh
10:20 - here but your Android app can contain uh
10:23 - more than one activity then there can be
10:27 - something like one activity below this
10:29 - second activity below this third
10:31 - activity and so on right so here is the
10:36 - uh main launcher you can say of your uh
10:42 - app so for the first time whenever you
10:46 - launch your uh application how will your
10:51 - Android app knows that which activity
10:54 - should appear if your Android app can
10:58 - contain many activities and which
11:00 - activity to launch first this is decided
11:03 - by this XML file for example uh this
11:06 - activity uh this app only have one
11:09 - activity and this is the basic uh logic
11:15 - which uh tells your app that this is our
11:18 - main activity and we need to launch this
11:21 - activity whenever we launch our app so
11:25 - all the activity uh mapping will be here
11:28 - in this folder and uh other other uh
11:33 - properties of your app will be here also
11:36 - for example your packages uh packages
11:40 - information or other informations uh
11:44 - related to your uh you know app will be
11:47 - here so your uh app name and styles and
11:51 - other things right so here all the
11:54 - activity uh you know listing will be
11:57 - here so this is the basic Bas overview
11:59 - of your Android app I hope you have
12:02 - enjoyed this video please rate comment

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see the basic overview of an Android app so in the last few video we have successfully created our first Android application and we would be able to run or we were able to run our first uh Android app on an Android emulator now for the first time when you see uh an Android app project it will look like this but what is what in this uh uh in this project for example this screen you see here is called an activity and the formal definition of an activity is an activity is a single focused thing that the user can do or in a simple terms you can say an activity is a screen which user interact with and an Android app can contain many activities uh in itself now where are these activities stored so when you go to your project overview here you can see three uh categories one is the project itself it's a broad project overview and this is what uh are the files and folders your project can contain right so it can contain the IDE files your app files gradal files and other uh files uh which your Android Studio needs to compile them the second overview when you go to the project overview is the package and these are the packages your app is using uh when uh you created your app but but the most important uh while developing your Android app is the Android category itself and this is where all your um you know programmable files are there and design of this activities are now this activity is just overview but behind this there is an XML file so when you go to your app and inside this app app there is a folder called Rees or res folder and inside this uh res folder there are uh some folders like drawable which contains some PNG files and your main activity or activity file is this one which is activity main.xml file other files are menu files which we we will see later and the next category is values category that also we will see later but right now the main important uh design uh XML file is this one so the XML file behind this uh uh screen is this main activity file or main activity uh XML file so you can uh click or you can open this XML file by clicking this text uh C category here so this is your design category of your uh activity and when you click here in the text it will open an XML file and this XML file is the main you know XML

uh choose my color and here is the result of the color so this is ff3 f1c so when I click okay the color will change and when I go to the text area it is the same background color which is f F3 FF F f1c which was the color we Cho we have chosen right the other thing is uh you can even change the color of your background color or properties of your main activity screen which is this one or layout you can just go to uh the background and just choose the color and choose any other color for example this blue color okay and it changes to the blue color okay now this is just a design part of your Android app but the main brain or you can say main uh you know actions are taken in the folder called Java and in here there is a uh Java class or Java file called main activity just open this and this is the class which is responsible for all the main actions of your app so for example you go to your main activity and you add some button here and you click this button all the code for clicking this button and whatever action uh will take while clicking this button will be written here so this is just a Java class which extends or inherits the bar activity class so this is our class uh which Android Studio have created for us and it extends so if you don't have uh much experience in Java programming I will recommend uh you can see my Java programming tutorial and you will be able to uh understand what this extend means but um simply this uh is inheriting for from this class and in here there are some already precreated method which Android Studio have created for us for the first

more than one activity then there can be something like one activity below this second activity below this third activity and so on right so here is the uh main launcher you can say of your uh app so for the first time whenever you launch your uh application how will your Android app knows that which activity should appear if your Android app can contain many activities and which activity to launch first this is decided by this XML file for example uh this activity uh this app only have one activity and this is the basic uh logic which uh tells your app that this is our main activity and
