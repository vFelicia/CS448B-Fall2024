00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how to use
00:07 - select clause in your statement or in
00:11 - your query in this video we will see how
00:16 - to use where clause in your
00:19 - query so suppose you have a table in
00:23 - which you have this
00:27 - data and you have have some
00:31 - software and from which you want to see
00:35 - this data and you just want to
00:41 - see the employee ID or the information
00:46 - of
00:47 - employee where employee ID is equal to
00:52 - 1 so how you can do this I will show
00:57 - you right now
01:02 - so what you have to write
01:06 - is
01:10 - Select from
01:14 - your
01:20 - database
01:24 - where
01:26 - Eid is equal to 1
01:32 - so this
01:35 - query will
01:38 - show the rows where or show the
01:43 - information of the employee where
01:45 - employee ID is equal to one so let's
01:48 - execute this query it if it works or
01:56 - not no it doesn't work because I haven't
02:00 - used star here so now it should work
02:05 - properly yes it shows
02:11 - me the information of the employee where
02:14 - employee ID is equal to
02:18 - 1 now suppose you want to
02:23 - show first two column first two rows of
02:27 - your database so for example you want to
02:30 - show the employee information
02:35 - where your employee ID is equal to two
02:40 - or less than two so how will you show
02:45 - this write the same query select star
02:49 - from your database dot table name where
02:53 - employee ID
02:56 - is less than or equal to two
03:01 - and let's
03:04 - see how it
03:06 - works and yes it works perfectly fine so
03:12 - only first two employee
03:16 - will be employee information will be
03:19 - seen in the same way you can use greater
03:23 - than sign to see the employee ID
03:27 - information greater than
03:32 - you can also use any of the column for
03:37 - example
03:39 - age age is equal
03:45 - to 33 I want to show John John's
03:49 - information so where age is equal to 33
03:52 - I will execute it and it
03:56 - works I if I want to show the employee
03:59 - information where
04:02 - age
04:04 - is greater than
04:08 - 30 and I will execute this query all the
04:13 - employee
04:14 - information where the employee age is
04:17 - greater than 30 will come so in this way
04:21 - you can use where clause in your
04:26 - MySQL and work according to it so I hope
04:31 - you have learned something new this time
04:33 - please wait comment and subscribe and
04:35 - bye for now
