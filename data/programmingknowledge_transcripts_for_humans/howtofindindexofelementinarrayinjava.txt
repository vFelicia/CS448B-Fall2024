00:01 - hello and welcome back to the new video
00:02 - of the Java tutorial Series so so till
00:05 - now we have covered the theoretical part
00:06 - of the array and we have also done uh
00:09 - some uh
00:11 - easy level questions of the array and in
00:14 - this video we'll be talking some uh
00:16 - medium level of medium level question of
00:18 - the array which requires some searching
00:20 - and sorting techniques uh so till now I
00:23 - have not discussed you the not discussed
00:26 - the searching and sorting algorithms
00:28 - which are there
00:30 - for used used in Java arrays so in
00:35 - upcoming videos we will cover that don't
00:37 - worry uh there are a number of the
00:39 - Sorting techniques and searching tests
00:41 - there are two two searching techniques
00:43 - are there which is linear search and
00:45 - variance binary search we will cover
00:47 - that in our upcoming videos so what will
00:49 - be the agenda for this video is I will
00:52 - be covering this uh three uh medium
00:54 - level questions which are arrays address
00:57 - questions uh so I again these these
01:01 - these many questions are not enough for
01:04 - you to practice you just have to get
01:06 - your hand dirty on the programming uh so
01:09 - what I suggest you you just go to the
01:11 - any any of the portal or Geeks for geeks
01:14 - hacker Rank and hacker hacker Earth
01:15 - Register there uh try solving uh
01:18 - questions on the arrays set the
01:20 - difficulty levels as easy medium then
01:22 - hard
01:24 - okay so practice more and more so that
01:27 - you can improve your logic building okay
01:28 - so let's get started uh what is the
01:31 - question write a Java program to test if
01:33 - an array contains a specific value so
01:36 - what these programs what this
01:39 - in this question what we have to do is
01:41 - we have to search for an element uh
01:44 - which is given by the first of all we
01:47 - require an array and inside that array
01:49 - you will be getting one uh element which
01:51 - is of uh arrays arrays of type into
01:54 - arrays holding the integer values itself
01:56 - and we uh you have to search that
01:58 - element inside that array whether that
02:00 - elements is present inside that array or
02:03 - not if that if that present inside the
02:05 - array you just simply return true
02:08 - Boolean value and if that elements
02:11 - doesn't uh present in inside that L
02:13 - array you just simply return false okay
02:16 - on the console okay so let me get into
02:20 - my IDE and I will just simply
02:22 - comment this out uh this is our previous
02:25 - videos Solutions okay and I will
02:29 - simply comment and here I will again
02:32 - comment and I will write
02:36 - medium
02:39 - question one
02:41 - okay medium level questions one okay uh
02:44 - now I will be creating one method inside
02:48 - this and since then since this method is
02:51 - public I will declare it as public and I
02:54 - will declare it as static because I have
02:56 - to call this inside my main method and
02:58 - which is the static method okay static
03:00 - uh and this is this will return a
03:04 - Boolean value either true or false it
03:06 - will return true if their element is
03:07 - present inside that array and it will
03:09 - return false if that element is not
03:11 - present inside that area okay and I will
03:14 - write
03:15 - uh My Method name as contains contains
03:19 - means whether that element is inside
03:21 - that array or not you can add anything
03:23 - whatever you want and I will pass my
03:26 - array
03:27 - and
03:29 - item means the value that we have we
03:32 - have to search inside that
03:33 - array okay and I will simply write one
03:36 - for Loop and so I will write integer I
03:41 - in
03:43 - array
03:45 - what we have to do uh we have to check
03:48 - if
03:49 - the array at ith index is equals to
03:54 - equals to
03:56 - um is equals to equals to item
03:59 - is equal equals index
04:03 - uh not just uh sorry uh I have followed
04:08 - the traditional for Loop over here I
04:11 - just have to write I is equals to equals
04:13 - to item oh
04:15 - sorry about that and I will write inside
04:18 - this return
04:21 - return true
04:25 - okay return to I guess this
04:29 - cannot return a value from a method with
04:33 - white word result type
04:38 - uh why am I getting
04:41 - oh wait I forgot that this is the
04:44 - separate method
04:46 - uh let me just remove this my main
04:49 - method so that program can understand
04:52 - this is as a separate method
04:55 - okay uh now it's okay I will import my
05:00 - main method over here
05:07 - why am I not getting
05:10 - wait a minute let me check this whether
05:15 - oh yeah sorry
05:17 - I have not ended the method
05:20 - now it's working fine I will get my main
05:24 - method okay now it's working fine okay
05:27 - and after this for Loop uh when the
05:30 - program execution will get at line
05:33 - number 36 when we doesn't uh find any
05:36 - element which matches to the item that
05:38 - we have passed to the method okay so in
05:40 - that case we simply written
05:43 - false okay now it's okay and now we will
05:47 - call that method inside this main method
05:49 - for that before that uh I will declare
05:52 - one array
05:53 - int
05:56 - array which is equals to
06:00 - I will simply assign the values over
06:04 - here itself or 10 comma 20 comma
06:08 - 23 comma 30 comma 45
06:12 - you can give any value whatever you want
06:16 - and after that I will require one
06:19 - variable
06:21 - item means the I value that we want to
06:24 - search inside that array and let's
06:26 - suppose we have to search 23 inside that
06:29 - array okay
06:31 - and now
06:32 - I will just
06:35 - print the
06:38 - call the contents method and I will pass
06:40 - array and
06:43 - item as my parameters to it okay now if
06:47 - I run this since the 23 is present
06:50 - inside this array the expected output
06:52 - should be true yes it is returning to
06:54 - and now if I give a item value as number
06:58 - which which is not present inside that
07:01 - array then in that case I should get
07:03 - false yes it is getting showing false
07:07 - okay now it's working fine so this is
07:09 - the solution to the question number one
07:13 - and what is the question number two
07:15 - second question that is fifth question
07:16 - write a Java program to find the index
07:19 - of an array element so we have to find
07:22 - the index
07:24 - of an array element okay
07:26 - so in this case
07:29 - we want we have to get one array from
07:32 - the user and we want
07:35 - one item like here we have declared over
07:38 - here one item should be there and we
07:40 - have to match whether that item is
07:42 - present inside that array or not if that
07:45 - matches we just have to return the index
07:48 - at which the item is whether inside that
07:51 - array okay
07:53 - this is the idea behind this question I
07:56 - will comment this out and this statement
07:59 - also and now here I will write one more
08:03 - comment
08:04 - uh
08:06 - medium
08:08 - question two
08:10 - and for this I will create I will create
08:13 - one in
08:15 - method by the name of find index because
08:18 - we have to find the index of the element
08:21 - that that is present inside the diary
08:24 - and I will write public
08:28 - static the return type should be in
08:31 - because we are retaining the index that
08:33 - is the integer value
08:34 - okay those are the method name is find
08:38 - index and this method is uh receiving
08:41 - one
08:42 - array as an input
08:45 - array as an input and integer
08:48 - uh t
08:50 - let me give it St okay
08:53 - okay so what we are going to do inside
08:57 - this we will check one base condition if
09:02 - my if the array
09:05 - is equals to equals to null
09:09 - then
09:12 - return minus one this is a this is
09:15 - called as base condition in programming
09:17 - you have to check the corner cases
09:19 - whether these are the cases uh that you
09:23 - need you need to handle or this will
09:25 - improve your space and time complexity
09:27 - of the
09:28 - your algorithm because if the array is
09:31 - original means array is empty there is
09:33 - no point checking doing all this uh
09:35 - running those Loops doing all those
09:38 - processing tasks then it it you can
09:40 - simply return -1 because if the array is
09:43 - null you are not getting going to get
09:45 - that element inside that array okay so
09:47 - this is the base
09:50 - condition
09:52 - that we have to check and
09:55 - now here I will write integer length
10:00 - equals to
10:03 - array Dot
10:06 - oops sorry
10:08 - error.length
10:11 - and I will require one more variable I
10:13 - is equals to 0
10:15 - and I will declare one while loop
10:18 - and inside this I will write I is less
10:21 - than my length
10:24 - okay uh I'm doing this task I'm running
10:27 - this while loop whenever
10:30 - my I is less than left so initially my
10:34 - value is 0 and length value is uh is the
10:37 - number of the elements which are better
10:38 - inside that array okay it can be
10:40 - anything 5 10 whatever the number of
10:42 - number of elements you pass inside the
10:44 - array and inside this for loop I will
10:46 - check one if condition if my array at
10:49 - ith index
10:50 - is equals to equals to p
10:53 - okay T is nothing but the value either
10:56 - item that we want to find inside that
10:58 - array in that case we will simply return
11:01 - the value of the I uh return
11:05 - the i i wins the well in this highest
11:08 - value I represents the current index at
11:10 - which the loop is running so if that
11:12 - elements matches the elements that we
11:14 - want to pass that we have passed to the
11:17 - method then in that case return the
11:19 - value of the I that mean return the
11:21 - value of the index at which the element
11:23 - is present inside the diary and if it is
11:27 - not present inside the diary if it not
11:29 - matches with the elements inside that
11:31 - array simply do I plus plus means
11:33 - increment the value of the I and again
11:35 - go further checking whether the I is
11:37 - less than equals to length and whenever
11:40 - my while loop is executed successfully
11:42 - and I till not found the element which
11:45 - is
11:46 - which I want to find inside that array
11:48 - in that case that means that that
11:50 - element is not present inside that array
11:51 - in that case we will simply return
11:54 - -1
11:55 - okay and now uh I hope this is the thing
11:59 - that we have to do inside this method
12:01 - and now if I go inside my main method I
12:06 - have I will be using the same array and
12:09 - here I will give 23 as an input the item
12:14 - which we have we are searching for in
12:16 - inside this array and add indexing start
12:18 - from 0 so 0 1 2 the expected output
12:22 - should be 2 okay
12:24 - and I will simply
12:27 - print
12:29 - I will call the method find index and I
12:33 - will pass array and the item to this
12:36 - method okay now if I run this
12:40 - I should get 0 1 2 yeah we are getting 2
12:44 - on the console because 0 1 2 the element
12:46 - is found at the index 23 and let me give
12:49 - the items value as 2 which is not there
12:52 - inside the diary in that case I should
12:54 - get the
12:56 - output as -1 yeah we are receiving it as
12:59 - minus one and if I give the array as an
13:02 - empty array
13:04 - base condition we also check
13:06 - in that case also we will receive minus
13:09 - one yeah we are receiving the minus one
13:10 - uh now it's okay
13:13 - now the one more question was there
13:16 - write a Java program to copy an array by
13:19 - iterating the array now uh we in this
13:23 - questions uh in this question we have
13:25 - given one array we just have to copy the
13:28 - elements which are present inside one
13:29 - array and take those elements and copy
13:32 - those all elements inside the new array
13:34 - okay so there are several ways by which
13:37 - you can write this code in optimized
13:39 - manner uh
13:41 - okay so for now till now I'm assuming
13:45 - that you know have you don't have any
13:48 - advanced knowledge about the arrays and
13:51 - problem solving so we'll go the basic
13:53 - approach itself okay uh so now
13:58 - I will comment it out
14:01 - and I will write one more comment over
14:03 - here
14:06 - taking medium
14:09 - question three
14:10 - and now I will comment this also okay
14:14 - so I will write one more method over
14:17 - here
14:17 - okay so what we'll be doing we just we
14:20 - just have to copy the elements okay so
14:23 - in that case the method should not
14:25 - return anything okay so the written type
14:27 - should be wired okay so I will
14:31 - public
14:33 - static
14:35 - void
14:38 - um late wait wait wait wait wait
14:41 - do I need to create one separate method
14:45 - first
14:46 - I think no need is there to create one
14:51 - separate method where we can do this
14:53 - kind of shop inside the main method
14:54 - itself
14:55 - okay so one array was declared already
14:58 - over here I will use the same array uh
15:00 - these items value was not required for
15:03 - me to in this question and I will
15:06 - declare one more here array I will call
15:10 - this as new
15:12 - array
15:14 - new integer of I mean I will give the
15:17 - same one two three four five capacity of
15:21 - five elements
15:23 - inside this area okay
15:26 - and now
15:28 - um
15:31 - to do this I one inbuilt method was
15:34 - there I will use it as
15:36 - okay I will write
15:41 - original
15:43 - array
15:45 - and to pin this array inside one go we
15:50 - have one method
15:53 - arrays
15:54 - Dot
15:57 - to string
15:59 - and we have to pass the array name to it
16:03 - okay
16:04 - now it's so rs.2 string iris is the
16:08 - class which is uh provided by the Java
16:10 - in the util package here you can see if
16:12 - I hover over here you can see java.util
16:15 - dot arrays and I guess yeah IntelliJ
16:19 - IDEA has also imported the following
16:22 - package okay
16:24 - what it will do it will get array as an
16:28 - input and it will convert that array in
16:30 - into the string okay so it will here you
16:33 - can see it it is accepting the array as
16:36 - in parameter and it will convert those
16:38 - array elements into the string and it
16:40 - will print all those in a sequence of
16:43 - that we have stored over here okay now
16:47 - I just have to copy all those elements
16:49 - so for the copying purpose I required
16:52 - one for Loop which will start from I is
16:55 - equals to zero and it will go till
16:58 - whether till my array dot length
17:02 - and each time I will be doing I plus
17:04 - plus and inside this array
17:07 - I will simply write new array wait wait
17:12 - wait
17:13 - new array at it index means the first
17:16 - India that is zeroth index I will copy
17:18 - the element which are which is present
17:21 - at array at ithe index means we are just
17:23 - simply taking the first element of the
17:25 - original array and we are assigning it
17:28 - to the value of the value at the zeroth
17:31 - index at the new array so similarly when
17:34 - we go for the again checking for the for
17:36 - loop at that time is value is 1 we will
17:38 - simply get the first element of the
17:40 - original array and copy it with this
17:41 - first position of the new array okay
17:45 - and after that
17:47 - once the for Loop is ended uh the same
17:50 - thing we are going to do we are going to
17:53 - print the
17:56 - copied array
17:59 - copied array and we'll pass
18:02 - new
18:03 - array as an input to this okay now if I
18:06 - run this
18:07 - same array should get printed okay
18:10 - original array is uh 10 20 23 30 45 and
18:13 - copied array is 10 20 30 to 23 30 and
18:16 - 45. so this is the solution to the
18:19 - question number sixth
18:21 - so I hope you got some idea how these
18:24 - searching and sorting techniques are
18:26 - done in Java there are some algorithms
18:29 - like I said a linear search binary
18:32 - search and for the Sorting uh bubble
18:34 - sort heaps or Radix or merge merge sort
18:36 - is there there are so many uh sorting
18:39 - techniques we will also cover that all
18:41 - these algorithms in our upcoming video
18:43 - for before that you should go to gigs
18:47 - for gigs or hacker rank to try solving
18:49 - some questions so that your logic
18:52 - building will get improved uh in the
18:54 - programming okay
18:55 - strength thank you guys for watching
18:57 - this video and I will see you in the
18:58 - next one

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to the new video of the Java tutorial Series so so till now we have covered the theoretical part of the array and we have also done uh some uh easy level questions of the array and in this video we'll be talking some uh medium level of medium level question of the array which requires some searching and sorting techniques uh so till now I have not discussed you the not discussed the searching and sorting algorithms which are there for used used in Java arrays so in upcoming videos we will cover that don't worry uh there are a number of the Sorting techniques and searching tests there are two two searching techniques are there which is linear search and variance binary search we will cover that in our upcoming videos so what will be the agenda for this video is I will be covering this uh three uh medium level questions which are arrays address questions uh so I again these these these many questions are not enough for you to practice you just have to get your hand dirty on the programming uh so what I suggest you you just go to the any any of the portal or Geeks for geeks hacker Rank and hacker hacker Earth Register there uh try solving uh questions on the arrays set the difficulty levels as easy medium then hard okay so practice more and more so that you can improve your logic building okay so let's get started uh what is the question write a Java program to test if an array contains a specific value so what these programs what this in this question what we have to do is we have to search for an element uh which is given by the first of all we require an array and inside that array you will be getting one uh element which is of uh arrays arrays of type into arrays holding the integer values itself and we uh you have to search that element inside that array whether that elements is present inside that array or not if that if that present inside the array you just simply return true Boolean value and if that elements doesn't uh present in inside that L array you just simply return false okay on the console okay so let me get into my IDE and I will just simply comment this out uh this is our previous videos Solutions okay and I will simply comment and here I will again comment and I will write medium question one okay medium level questions one okay uh now I will be creating one method inside this and since then since this method is public I will declare it as public and I will declare it as static because I have to call this inside my main method and which is the static method okay static uh and this is this will return a Boolean value either true or false it will return true if their element is present inside that array and it will return false if that element is not present inside that area okay and I will write uh My Method name as contains contains means whether that element is inside that array or not you can add anything whatever you want and I will pass my array and item means the value that we have we have to search inside that array okay and I will simply write one for Loop and so I will write integer I in array what we have to do uh we have to check if the array at ith index is equals to equals to um is equals to equals to item is equal equals index uh not just uh sorry uh I have followed the traditional for Loop over here I just have to write I is equals to equals to item oh sorry about that and I will write inside this return return true okay return to I guess this cannot return a value from a method with white word result type uh why am I getting oh wait I forgot that this is the separate method uh let me just remove this my main method so that program can understand this is as a separate method okay uh now it's okay I will import my main method over here why am I not getting wait a minute let me check this whether oh yeah sorry I have not ended the method now it's working fine I will get my main method okay now it's working fine okay and after this for Loop uh when the program execution will get at line number 36 when we doesn't uh find any element which matches to the item that we have passed to the method okay so in that case we simply written false okay now it's okay and now we will call that method inside this main method for that before that uh I will declare one array int array which is equals to I will simply assign the values over here itself or 10 comma 20 comma 23 comma 30 comma 45 you can give any value whatever you want and after that I will require one variable item means the I value that we want to search inside that array and let's suppose we have to search 23 inside that array okay and now I will just print the call the contents method and I will pass array and item as my parameters to it okay now if I run this since the 23 is present inside this array the expected output should be true yes it is returning to and now if I give a item value as number which which is not present inside that array then in that case I should get false yes it is getting showing false okay now it's working fine so this is the solution to the question number one and what is the question number two second question that is fifth question write a Java program to find the index of an array element so we have to find the index of an array element okay so in this case we want we have to get one array from the user and we want one item like here we have declared over here one item should be there and we have to match whether that item is present inside that array or not if that matches we just have to return the index at which the item is whether inside that array okay this is the idea behind this question I will comment this out and this statement also and now here I will write one more comment uh medium question two and for this I will create I will create one in method by the name of find index because we have to find the index of the element that that is present inside the diary and I will write public static the return type should be in because we are retaining the index that is the integer value okay those are the method name is find index and this method is uh receiving one array as an input array as an input and integer uh t let me give it St okay okay so what we are going to do inside this we will check one base condition if my if the array is equals to equals to null then return minus one this is a this is called as base condition in programming you have to check the corner cases whether these are the cases uh that you need you need to handle or this will improve your space and time complexity of the your algorithm because if the array is original means array is empty there is no point checking doing all this uh running those Loops doing all those processing tasks then it it you can simply return 1 because if the array is null you are not getting going to get that element inside that array okay so this is the base condition that we have to check and now here I will write integer length equals to array Dot oops sorry error.length and I will require one more variable I is equals to 0 and I will declare one while loop and inside this I will write I is less than my length okay uh I'm doing this task I'm running this while loop whenever my I is less than left so initially my value is 0 and length value is uh is the number of the elements which are better inside that array okay it can be anything 5 10 whatever the number of number of elements you pass inside the array and inside this for loop I will check one if condition if my array at ith index is equals to equals to p okay T is nothing but the value either item that we want to find inside that array in that case we will simply return the value of the I uh return the i i wins the well in this highest value I represents the current index at which the loop is running so if that elements matches the elements that we want to pass that we have passed to the method then in that case return the value of the I that mean return the value of the index at which the element is present inside the diary and if it is not present inside the diary if it not matches with the elements inside that array simply do I plus plus means increment the value of the I and again go further checking whether the I is less than equals to length and whenever my while loop is executed successfully and I till not found the element which is which I want to find inside that array in that case that means that that element is not present inside that array in that case we will simply return 1 okay and now uh I hope this is the thing that we have to do inside this method and now if I go inside my main method I have I will be using the same array and here I will give 23 as an input the item which we have we are searching for in inside this array and add indexing start from 0 so 0 1 2 the expected output should be 2 okay and I will simply print I will call the method find index and I will pass array and the item to this method okay now if I run this I should get 0 1 2 yeah we are getting 2 on the console because 0 1 2 the element is found at the index 23 and let me give the items value as 2 which is not there inside the diary in that case I should get the output as 1 yeah we are receiving it as minus one and if I give the array as an empty array base condition we also check in that case also we will receive minus one yeah we are receiving the minus one uh now it's okay now the one more question was there write a Java program to copy an array by iterating the array now uh we in this questions uh in this question we have given one array we just have to copy the elements which are present inside one array and take those elements and copy those all elements inside the new array okay so there are several ways by which you can write this code in optimized manner uh okay so for now till now I'm assuming that you know have you don't have any advanced knowledge about the arrays and problem solving so we'll go the basic approach itself okay uh so now I will comment it out and I will write one more comment over here taking medium question three and now I will comment this also okay so I will write one more method over here okay so what we'll be doing we just we just have to copy the elements okay so in that case the method should not return anything okay so the written type should be wired okay so I will public static void um late wait wait wait wait wait do I need to create one separate method first I think no need is there to create one separate method where we can do this kind of shop inside the main method itself okay so one array was declared already over here I will use the same array uh these items value was not required for me to in this question and I will declare one more here array I will call this as new array new integer of I mean I will give the same one two three four five capacity of five elements inside this area okay and now um to do this I one inbuilt method was there I will use it as okay I will write original array and to pin this array inside one go we have one method arrays Dot to string and we have to pass the array name to it okay now it's so rs.2 string iris is the class which is uh provided by the Java in the util package here you can see if I hover over here you can see java.util dot arrays and I guess yeah IntelliJ IDEA has also imported the following package okay what it will do it will get array as an input and it will convert that array in into the string okay so it will here you can see it it is accepting the array as in parameter and it will convert those array elements into the string and it will print all those in a sequence of that we have stored over here okay now I just have to copy all those elements so for the copying purpose I required one for Loop which will start from I is equals to zero and it will go till whether till my array dot length and each time I will be doing I plus plus and inside this array I will simply write new array wait wait wait new array at it index means the first India that is zeroth index I will copy the element which are which is present at array at ithe index means we are just simply taking the first element of the original array and we are assigning it to the value of the value at the zeroth index at the new array so similarly when we go for the again checking for the for loop at that time is value is 1 we will simply get the first element of the original array and copy it with this first position of the new array okay and after that once the for Loop is ended uh the same thing we are going to do we are going to print the copied array copied array and we'll pass new array as an input to this okay now if I run this same array should get printed okay original array is uh 10 20 23 30 45 and copied array is 10 20 30 to 23 30 and 45. so this is the solution to the question number sixth so I hope you got some idea how these searching and sorting techniques are done in Java there are some algorithms like I said a linear search binary search and for the Sorting uh bubble sort heaps or Radix or merge merge sort is there there are so many uh sorting techniques we will also cover that all these algorithms in our upcoming video for before that you should go to gigs for gigs or hacker rank to try solving some questions so that your logic building will get improved uh in the programming okay strength thank you guys for watching this video and I will see you in the next one
