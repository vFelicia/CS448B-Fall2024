00:00 - hey everyone today we'll be talking
00:02 - about one of the graphic user interfaces
00:05 - provided by python thinker
00:09 - it is a standard python interface to the
00:11 - TK GUI toolkit shipped with python now
00:14 - what is TK TK is a free and open source
00:18 - widget toolkit it provides a library of
00:21 - widgets for building a graphical user
00:23 - interface in many programming languages
00:25 - but now since we are working with python
00:27 - we have to enter module DK has a
00:31 - cross-platform operating system and it
00:33 - is written in C
00:35 - now to install tincter you can run pip
00:38 - install tincter
00:39 - you will write pip install
00:42 - tincter in the terminal and you'll be
00:45 - good to go
00:47 - please note that if you're working with
00:49 - python 2 it is Center the DS capital and
00:52 - if you're working with Python 3 it is
00:53 - technology is in lowercase the spelling
00:57 - is the same it's just the difference of
00:59 - the cases
01:01 - Now to create anything to your app you
01:03 - would basically be following these four
01:05 - steps you'll be importing the tincter
01:07 - module you'll create the main window
01:10 - now windows are the containers in which
01:13 - all other GUI elements live now what are
01:15 - these other GUI elements these are
01:18 - widgets widgets can be text boxes labels
01:21 - buttons Etc we'll be making each one of
01:24 - them in the upcoming videos
01:27 - widgets are contained inside of Windows
01:29 - okay
01:31 - and that's what the third step is you'll
01:33 - be adding these widgets to the main
01:35 - window you can add any number of widgets
01:37 - to the main window
01:39 - then you'll call in the main Loop method
01:41 - it is used when your application is
01:44 - ready to run it is an infinite Loop main
01:46 - Loop is an infinite Loop used to run the
01:49 - application
01:50 - wait for an event to occur and process
01:53 - the event as long as the window is not
01:55 - closed okay
01:56 - we also have geometry managers namely
02:00 - the park grid and place Park is very
02:03 - much used
02:04 - but we would not talk about them right
02:07 - now we would talk about them later
02:09 - right now we would try to get the
02:12 - tincter window the master window that we
02:15 - just talked about above
02:17 - I write the least code to make the
02:19 - window appear let's do that I'll import
02:22 - enter I'll write import
02:27 - I'll have my window the window I was
02:30 - talking about in the second step
02:34 - and
02:35 - I'll write when
02:37 - equals thinker dot TK
02:41 - fine
02:43 - now TK can have a lot of arguments so
02:45 - the screen name sets the display event
02:47 - base name sets the profile file by
02:51 - default it is derived from the program
02:53 - name okay
02:54 - now class name it is the name of the
02:57 - widget that is currently used widget
02:59 - class it is TK here okay
03:02 - then we have use TK if it is true it
03:05 - initializes CK subsystem
03:08 - we have sync it is used for debugging
03:10 - basically it executes all X server
03:13 - commands synchronously then we have use
03:16 - which specifies ID of the window for the
03:18 - application now these all arguments
03:21 - might not make sense to you right now
03:23 - but once we start making big
03:25 - applications with tincter you'll get the
03:27 - use of them
03:29 - now I'll write win dot main Loop
03:33 - and I have called in the main loop I
03:36 - told you I won't be making any visit
03:38 - right now I have skipped the third step
03:41 - and called in the main Loop okay now
03:44 - let's run this and see if we can get the
03:46 - window
03:52 - so I can see the window that I declared
03:55 - you can even resize it
03:58 - this logo is of TK software
04:02 - if you search on the internet about TK
04:05 - you'll see this logo
04:09 - you can also add in a title to this
04:11 - let's do that I'll write win.title I'll
04:14 - give the title my first thing term
04:16 - window
04:20 - now you can see the title appearing
04:23 - it's my first enter window it was TK
04:26 - here earlier now after this we start
04:29 - making Twitter applications but in the
04:31 - next video we would talk about something
04:33 - per modules
04:35 - Tinker is very easy to work with and
04:38 - with a very less amount of code you can
04:40 - receive a lot so the upcoming videos
04:43 - would be very helpful for you
04:45 - thank you
