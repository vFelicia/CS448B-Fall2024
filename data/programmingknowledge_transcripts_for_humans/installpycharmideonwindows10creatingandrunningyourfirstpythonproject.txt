00:46 - so we are going to click on this Python
00:49 - 3 point 7 point 4 and then when you
00:51 - scroll down here you will see the Files
00:54 - section here and what we are interested
00:57 - in is this Windows section and we are
01:00 - going to download the windows x86 64 bit
01:05 - executable installer so this is what we
01:09 - want so we are going to just click on
01:10 - this link which says windows x86 64
01:15 - executable installer and it's around 25
01:20 - megabyte file so it will take few

01:31 - see this first window here I'm going to
01:33 - just say run and now you can see this
01:35 - installation wizard is open so by
01:38 - default python is installed on this path
01:41 - on your Windows operating system but
01:45 - what I would like to do is I like to
01:48 - install my Python in my C directory so I
01:51 - can easily access that directory so what
01:55 - I'm going to do is I'm going to choose
01:57 - the second option which says customize
01:59 - the installation okay so before choosing

02:52 - directory into my c drive so i'm going
02:55 - to just go to my pc and then into my c
02:58 - drive and you can see there is no python
03:02 - directory there so I'm going to create a
03:04 - Python directory here so folder and the
03:07 - name of the folder will be Python ok so
03:10 - this is what I have created so now this
03:13 - Python will be installed in this
