00:11 - behind why I was showing to code in
00:15 - Python using Idol in the first few
00:17 - videos because I wanted that you get
00:20 - familiar first with Python interpreter
00:24 - so now whenever you want to test some
00:27 - functionality in Python you don't need
00:30 - to open any IDE or any editor you can
00:33 - just open your terminal and then test
00:36 - that functionality until you wanted to
00:39 - test something terminal or Python
00:42 - interpreter was okay but when you want
00:46 - to develop a big project using Python we
00:50 - need to use some kind of IDE IDE stands
00:54 - for integrated development environment
00:57 - in order to develop such kind of
01:00 - projects so in this video I'm going to
01:03 - show you how to install
01:05 - pycharm on your Windows 10 operating
01:07 - system which is the most popular IDE
