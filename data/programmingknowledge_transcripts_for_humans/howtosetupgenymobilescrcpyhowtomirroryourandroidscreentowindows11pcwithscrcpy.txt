00:30 - scrcpy
00:32 - and the first result which you will see
00:34 - here will be from github dot com forward
00:37 - slash
00:38 - gennymotion forward slash screen copy so
00:41 - just click on this github link i'm going
00:44 - to put this link in the description of
00:46 - this video also so you can directly
00:48 - click on this link and come to this
00:50 - website
00:51 - now in here when you will scroll down
00:54 - you will be able to read more about
00:57 - screen copy what it can do
00:59 - it says this application provides
01:01 - display and control of android devices
01:04 - connected via usb right
01:07 - now when you scroll more down here you
01:10 - will be able to see how you can get this
01:13 - app
01:14 - and for windows you have this download
01:16 - link here
01:18 - so i'm going to click on this download
01:20 - link which is in front of this windows
01:22 - and what this is going to do is it's
01:24 - going to start the download of this zip
01:27 - file so once this zip file is downloaded
01:30 - you just need to go to the location
01:32 - where it's downloaded
01:33 - and you can just uh
01:36 - just cut it from here and
01:38 - just paste it wherever you feel
01:41 - comfortable to place this
01:43 - file on your windows 11 operating system
01:47 - what i generally prefer i generally try
01:50 - to go to my c drive and here i create a
01:54 - folder with the name s c r c p y so i
01:59 - know that
02:01 - this is the destination and it's easier
02:03 - to remember also right and once this
02:06 - folder is created i'm going to paste
02:07 - this zip file which i have downloaded
02:09 - and then you can extract this file using
02:11 - any tool
02:13 - windows also provide you
02:15 - a tool to extract this file so just
02:17 - right click on it and then click on
02:19 - extract all
02:21 - and then you just need to provide the
02:24 - destinations so i'm going to extract all
02:26 - these files to the same folder which is
02:28 - called scrcpy okay so c
02:31 - uh colon backslash scrcpy and then click
02:34 - on extract which is going to extract all
02:37 - the files in the same folder so you can
02:39 - see all these files are extracted here
02:42 - after extracting this zip file if you
02:44 - want to delete this zip file from here
02:46 - it's okay so once you have extracted
02:49 - this file
02:50 - what you need to do
02:52 - so you can see there is this executable
02:55 - file here which is called scrcpy which
02:58 - helps us
03:00 - to just
03:01 - run our android device and mirror our
03:04 - android device on our windows 11
03:06 - operating system
03:08 - so once you once again go to this github
03:10 - website of screen copy and when you
03:13 - scroll down
03:14 - you will be able to see how you can use
03:16 - it so you can see under run
03:18 - you just need to give this command on
03:21 - your command prompt or your terminal
03:23 - in order to connect your android device
03:26 - to your windows 11 operating system so
03:30 - let me show you how you can use it you
03:31 - have two options to use this file
03:35 - one is if you don't set the environment
03:37 - variable then you need to every time go
03:40 - to the same folder and from here
03:43 - you need to open the terminal so right
03:45 - click and then
03:46 - open in windows terminal or you can open
03:49 - the command prompt from here just write
03:51 - cmd and then
03:53 - open the command prompt and then cd to
03:56 - this folder okay so right click and then
03:59 - open in terminal
04:01 - it's going to open in the powershell you
04:04 - can see here and
04:06 - you can also see that this
04:08 - folder is c colon backslash screen copy
04:12 - now at this point you need to connect
04:14 - your android phone via usb cable to your
04:18 - windows 11 operating system it's same
04:21 - like charging your android device using
04:24 - the windows 11 operating system so now i
04:26 - have connected the android device on my
04:30 - windows 11 operating system
04:32 - so after connecting you just need to
04:33 - type this command scr
04:36 - cpy
04:38 - dot exe on powershell okay so on
04:41 - powershell you need to type the full
04:43 - name which i have typed here so just
04:46 - type exactly what's written here and
04:49 - then press enter
04:51 - and once you press enter your android
04:54 - device will be mirrored
04:56 - on your windows 11 operating system so
04:58 - you can see my android device is
05:00 - mirrored now and you can see
05:03 - that i can see my android device and you
05:07 - can see that my android device is
05:10 - mirrored on my windows 11 operating
05:12 - system now if it doesn't work for some
05:14 - reason then you might need to enable the
05:17 - usb debugging on your android device
05:20 - right so you can see right now the usb
05:24 - debugging
05:26 - is connected on my android device so i'm
05:29 - going to also show you how you can
05:30 - enable this usb debugging on your
05:33 - android device towards the end of this
05:35 - videos just watch this video until the
05:38 - end
05:38 - and i'm going to show you how you can
05:40 - enable this and then it's going to work
05:44 - on your windows 11 operating system now
05:46 - when you are done you just need to press
05:48 - ctrl c on your terminal and then the
05:51 - mirroring will stop right
05:54 - let me show you how you can do the same
05:56 - on the command prompt so just copy the
05:59 - path here
06:00 - and then search for cmd here
06:02 - and then just
06:04 - cd and then press the path which is c
06:07 - colon backslash screen copy
06:10 - and here once again after connecting
06:12 - your android device you just need to
06:15 - write scrcp
06:17 - why here dot exe is optional you can
06:20 - just write sci cpy and then press enter
06:24 - on your command prompt on on powershell
06:26 - i think you need dot exe
06:28 - extension
06:30 - so once again you can see this android
06:32 - device is mirrored on my windows 11
06:35 - operating system
06:36 - now let me show you one more thing
06:39 - which is
06:41 - every time you can't go to this folder
06:44 - and then open the terminal right so for
06:46 - example when i open the cmd
06:50 - and i'm in the different folder other
06:52 - than this screen copy folder
06:55 - and let's say i want to run this command
06:57 - from here
06:58 - for this i need to set the environment
07:00 - variables so for now when i write sci
07:03 - cpy this command will not be recognized
07:06 - right it says
07:08 - scrcpy is not recognized as an internal
07:11 - or external command
07:12 - so for that what you need to do
07:15 - for setting the environment variables
07:17 - just copy this path
07:19 - and then search for
07:21 - environment variables okay so just write
07:24 - environment variables in the search bar
07:28 - and when you type first few letters of
07:30 - environment
07:31 - you will be able to see uh this option
07:33 - which says edit the system environment
07:35 - variables you need to open this just
07:38 - click on this and then click on
07:40 - environment variables option here
07:43 - and once you are here you need to select
07:45 - path environment variables and double
07:48 - click on it or you can click on edit
07:50 - here
07:52 - now at this point you just need to paste
07:54 - this path
07:55 - at the very bottom so whatever you have
07:58 - copied just paste it here in my case
08:00 - it's c colon backslash screen copy and
08:03 - then press enter and then click on ok
08:05 - and then click on ok and then click on
08:07 - ok
08:08 - once you do that you will be able to run
08:11 - this screen copy command
08:13 - from anywhere from your windows file
08:16 - system
08:17 - so once again when i open the command
08:19 - prompt and this time you can see i'm in
08:22 - the different folder other than screen
08:23 - copy but still when i write scrcp
08:28 - y command here and then press enter
08:31 - it recognizes this command and connects
08:34 - my
08:34 - android device
08:36 - on
08:37 - my windows 11 operating system and i
08:40 - will be able to mirror this android
08:43 - device on my windows 11 operating system
08:46 - now in case you face any problem related
08:48 - to the mirroring of your android device
08:51 - on your
08:52 - operating system using screen copy
08:55 - you just need to enable your usb
08:57 - debugging on your android device so let
09:00 - me show you how you can enable your uh
09:02 - usb debugging on your android device if
09:05 - you face any problem so once again i'm
09:08 - going to just show my android screen uh
09:10 - by
09:11 - scrc py command
09:15 - so you can see my
09:17 - android device and then you just need to
09:19 - go to the settings here in order to
09:21 - enable the usb debugging
09:24 - so once the settings open you just need
09:26 - to go at the very bottom where it says
09:28 - about phone and click on about phone
09:31 - and then just go to the build number and
09:34 - press it
09:35 - a few times
09:37 - so after pressing few times you will see
09:39 - that the developer option will be
09:41 - enabled on your android device so when
09:44 - you go back you will see this developer
09:47 - option
09:48 - which will be enabled so just click on
09:51 - the developer option go inside that and
09:54 - make sure that this
09:56 - top developer option has been enabled so
09:59 - you just need to enable the top
10:01 - developer option and then you
10:05 - also need to make sure
10:07 - that under debugging section your usb
10:09 - debugging is on
10:11 - so you need to enable this if it's not
10:14 - enabled so so just make sure that you
10:17 - have enabled your usb debugging and then
10:21 - you just enable all the options related
10:24 - to usb uh debugging okay
10:27 - so if you do that definitely this method
10:31 - is going to work on your
10:33 - android device so this is how you can
10:36 - mirror your android device on your
10:39 - windows 11 operating system using
10:41 - a usb cable i hope you've enjoyed this
10:44 - video i will see you in the next video
