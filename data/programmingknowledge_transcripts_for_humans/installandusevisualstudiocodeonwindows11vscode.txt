02:25 - right
02:26 - so i'm going to check all these check
02:28 - boxes and then click on next
02:30 - and then
02:31 - you will see the summary here just click
02:34 - on install which is going to start the
02:36 - installation of visual studio code at
02:38 - this point you just need to wait until
02:40 - this progress bar reaches to the 100
02:42 - mark and once that's done you will be
02:45 - able to see uh this message completing
02:47 - the visual studio code setup also you
02:50 - can see the visual studio code shortcut
02:53 - has been created on my desktop
02:56 - so at this point just leave this
02:58 - checkbox as checked which is going to
03:00 - launch visual studio code on your
03:02 - windows 11 operating system just click
03:04 - on finish and it's going to launch
03:07 - visual studio code so as you can see for
03:09 - the first time when you start visual
03:11 - studio code
03:13 - you have the option to select few things
03:16 - you can choose which
03:19 - theme you want for your visual studio
03:21 - code so i'm going to leave it as dark
03:24 - mode
03:24 - otherwise you can also choose the light
03:27 - theme and then high contrast theme and
03:30 - there are multiple themes available for
03:32 - visual studio code so at this point your
03:34 - visual studio installation is pretty
03:37 - much finished but let me show you a few
03:39 - more things about visual studio code and
03:42 - let me also show you how you can use
03:45 - visual studio code for developing
03:47 - different programming languages so first
03:49 - of all when i open the command prompt by
03:52 - just
03:53 - clicking on the search icon and then
03:55 - just type cmd which is going to open the
03:57 - command prompt
03:58 - and in here when you type code and then
04:01 - press enter it's going to open visual
04:04 - studio code on your windows 11 operating
04:06 - system so you can open visual studio
04:08 - code
04:09 - from your command prompt from any folder
04:13 - wherever you want right now one more
04:16 - thing which you can do with your visual
04:17 - studio code
04:19 - so let's say i'm going to create a new
04:21 - folder on my desktop you can create this
04:23 - folder anywhere you want
04:25 - and then i'm going to name it as
04:28 - let's say
04:29 - sample folder
04:31 - and i want to open this folder using the
04:34 - command prompt right so i'm going to
04:36 - navigate to this folder using the
04:38 - command prompt let's say cd
04:41 - and then
04:42 - the folder is on my desktop right so i'm
04:45 - going to just cd to my desktop
04:48 - and then
04:49 - here i just need to cd once again to my
04:51 - sample folder right and when you type
04:55 - code space dot here it's going to open
04:57 - visual studio code so let me just press
05:00 - enter here
05:01 - so what it's going to do is it's going
05:04 - to open visual studio code
05:06 - and this folder will be opened right in
05:09 - the explorer
05:10 - here for the first time you just need to
05:13 - click on the yes i trust the author
05:16 - button and you can see visual studio has
05:19 - opened the sample folder on my visual
05:22 - studio code editor right
05:25 - now in here
05:26 - i can create files using this
05:30 - button which is for creating the files i
05:32 - can create the folder inside this sample
05:35 - folder i can also create files using
05:38 - this file option
05:40 - and i can also open some folder using
05:43 - this file option right
05:45 - so let me create a very simple file here
05:48 - so i can right click also and then
05:51 - click on new file here and then i can
05:54 - just
05:54 - type
05:56 - hello dot js here which is going to
05:59 - create the hello.js or javascript file
06:03 - now visual studio code is smart enough
06:06 - to understand that we have created a
06:09 - javascript file so you will be able to
06:11 - see this language here which is
06:13 - automatically selected for us
06:16 - which is
06:17 - javascript and visual studio comes with
06:20 - the support of javascript by default
06:24 - so when you type some javascript code
06:26 - here so
06:27 - const x is equal to
06:30 - let's say
06:31 - hello world here right so visual studio
06:35 - code is going to understand that you are
06:38 - writing the javascript code
06:40 - and it's going to provide you the
06:42 - intellisense for javascript so let's say
06:45 - i want to print this
06:47 - value of x and when i press co n for
06:51 - example it's going to show me the
06:53 - intellisense what i'm trying to write
06:56 - right so i can select console from here
06:58 - and then
07:00 - log so you can see i have
07:02 - multiple options which i can call on the
07:06 - console right so i want to just use a
07:09 - log here and then i'm going to just
07:13 - print the value of x so as you can see
07:15 - visual studio code comes with the
07:17 - support of javascript and many other
07:20 - languages by default so you don't even
07:23 - need to install any extra support for
07:26 - some languages right
07:28 - you can press ctrl s to save your code
07:32 - or you can just go to the file option
07:35 - and then click on save but control s is
07:38 - easier to
07:40 - do right
07:41 - now
07:42 - right now you can see
07:44 - that this font size is very small
07:48 - let's say i want to increase the font
07:49 - size of
07:51 - all the widgets on my visual studio code
07:54 - i just need to press ctrl and then plus
07:58 - option okay so just press ctrl and plus
08:01 - which is going to increase the font it's
08:04 - just going to increase the font size of
08:06 - all the widgets on your visual studio
08:08 - codes and then once again when you press
08:11 - control plus again you can see the font
08:14 - size of all the widgets is once again
08:18 - increased you can also say that we are
08:22 - doing the zoom option on visual studio
08:25 - code in order to reduce the font size
08:28 - you can
08:29 - press ctrl and then minus or
08:32 - hyphen option
08:34 - on your windows 11 so control and hyphen
08:36 - which is going to
08:38 - reduce the font size so i think this
08:41 - font size is
08:43 - okay for now for this video
08:45 - demonstration purposes
08:47 - now
08:49 - when you want to run this code so how
08:51 - you can run this code you have a few
08:53 - options
08:54 - if you are a fan of terminal or command
08:57 - prompt so you want to run your apps
09:00 - using the command prompt
09:02 - visual studio comes with the integrated
09:06 - terminal which you can use
09:08 - using this option which is called
09:10 - terminal so just click on terminal and
09:12 - then
09:12 - click on new terminal or you can press
09:16 - this option so on different keyboards
09:19 - you will see that this option changes
09:22 - right so i have a german keyboard so i
09:24 - have this ctrl shift
09:26 - loud but on your
09:29 - keyboard let's say for us you will see
09:31 - the different option here right
09:34 - so just click on new uh terminal here
09:36 - which is going to open
09:38 - the command prompt on the same folder
09:42 - in which you are working right now so
09:45 - you can see i'm working in the sample
09:47 - folder
09:48 - here is the sample folder
09:50 - and
09:51 - right now i am inside the sample folder
09:53 - in the command prompt right
09:56 - so from here
09:57 - i can run my code so let's say i want to
10:00 - run this code using node.js i can just
10:03 - write node here and then the name of the
10:05 - file which is
10:07 - hello.js
10:08 - and you can also see
10:10 - that
10:11 - visual studio code has opened the
10:14 - powershell editor for us you can see
10:17 - windows powershell so it's same like
10:20 - opening the powershell on your windows
10:23 - 11 operating system so when you just
10:25 - type a
10:26 - powershell here
10:27 - you can open powershell here on your
10:30 - windows 11 operating system so it's
10:33 - similar to using powershell on your
10:35 - visual studio code terminal now let's
10:38 - say you want to use different terminals
10:40 - so windows comes with powershell and the
10:43 - command prompt right so right now you
10:45 - can see powershell terminal is open
10:48 - if you want to change it to command
10:50 - prompt you just need to
10:51 - click on this small arrow here you can
10:54 - see this arrow
10:56 - and you can select which type of
10:58 - terminal you want so i'm going to choose
11:01 - the command prompt from here
11:03 - then it's going to open the command
11:05 - prompt so you can see we have opened
11:07 - multiple terminals and the list of all
11:10 - the terminals is going to appear on the
11:13 - left hand side so on the first terminal
11:15 - i have powershell open
11:17 - on the second terminal which is in the
11:19 - same folder
11:20 - i have command prompt opened i can also
11:23 - open let's say javascript debug terminal
11:27 - and it's going to open the javascript
11:29 - debug terminal for us which is
11:31 - essentially
11:32 - the powershell terminal in my case right
11:36 - you can also split your terminal so you
11:40 - can see you have the option to split the
11:42 - terminal so you can see when you just
11:44 - hover over the split terminal option
11:46 - here
11:47 - you can select which terminal you want
11:50 - to split so let's say i want to split
11:52 - the command prompt terminal
11:55 - you can see there are two uh command
11:57 - prompt terminals which are open and you
12:00 - will be able to see
12:01 - all these options here you can also
12:04 - close the terminal by just clicking on
12:06 - this delete icon here
12:08 - which is going to delete the terminal
12:10 - right so if you want to delete this
12:11 - powershell terminal you can just click
12:14 - on the delete uh
12:16 - icon on the powershell option so this
12:18 - was a brief introduction about terminal
12:21 - if you want to customize and configure
12:23 - more
12:25 - on your terminal you have all these
12:27 - options which you can use here so just
12:29 - play with all these options and see what
12:32 - they can do
12:34 - you also have this search option here so
12:38 - let's say i want to search something on
12:40 - visual studio code i can just
12:42 - press ctrl f
12:44 - keys and then it's going to show me this
12:47 - find option here
12:49 - and then i can find something let's say
12:51 - i want to search for
12:53 - all the logs right so i can just write
12:56 - log here and then you can see the this
12:58 - log is highlighted here
13:00 - right
13:01 - you can also replace
13:03 - this so let's say i want to replace
13:07 - this
13:07 - log with something else so let's say i
13:10 - want to
13:10 - replace this
13:12 - by
13:12 - dir
13:14 - so i can do this and then i can just
13:16 - click on this option which is going to
13:18 - replace all the occurrence of log
13:21 - in the current file or i can just select
13:23 - this option which is going to replace
13:25 - the first found
13:27 - item so whatever item is highlighted
13:29 - here it's going to replace that only so
13:32 - you can see
13:33 - right now three of three is highlighted
13:36 - i can just uh
13:38 - click on this arrow button and see where
13:40 - else this log appears on my file
13:43 - right now one of three uh occurrence is
13:47 - highlighted which is this one i can
13:49 - click on this uh button which is going
13:52 - to replace
13:53 - this highlighted log by dir
13:57 - if i press on this option it's going to
13:59 - replace all the occurrence of
14:01 - occurrences of log so you can see it's
14:04 - done that
14:05 - so this is how you can find and replace
14:08 - in your visual studio code editor
14:11 - now
14:12 - if you want to
14:13 - search in all the files inside your
14:17 - project folder you have this search
14:20 - option so let's say i have 10
14:22 - javascript files inside this sample
14:25 - folder
14:26 - then you can just click on this option
14:28 - which can be used as a global search
14:31 - inside your project folder so let's say
14:34 - i want to just search for logs
14:36 - you can see i only have one file inside
14:39 - this sample folder so it has
14:42 - found all the occurrences of log but if
14:45 - my folder contains multiple javascript
14:48 - files then also it's going to show me
14:50 - the list of all the occurrences of log
14:54 - in my project folder in all the files
14:57 - and here also i can replace log by any
15:00 - other
15:01 - word
15:02 - or any other options here so this is for
15:04 - the global search you have the explorer
15:07 - here which is going to show you all the
15:09 - project files then you have the search
15:12 - option
15:13 - then the third option here is for the
15:16 - source control so let's say you have so
15:18 - let's say you have git installed or any
15:20 - other version control tool installed
15:23 - visual studio code is going to detect
15:25 - that tool and it's going to show you
15:28 - the changed file or if you make
15:32 - some changes in your code it's going to
15:34 - show you all the options related to
15:37 - the version control in this window
15:40 - right so you can
15:42 - commit your source code you can push
15:44 - your source code
15:45 - you can pull the source code from github
15:48 - or any other repository in the source
15:50 - control section right
15:53 - now the next option here is the run and
15:55 - debug option right
15:58 - so you can see run and debug so
16:01 - you have the option to debug your code
16:04 - using visual studio code so as i said
16:07 - visual studio code comes with support of
16:10 - some languages but if it doesn't
16:13 - come with the inherent support for some
16:16 - language
16:17 - you can install the support for that
16:20 - language also using packages and other
16:23 - options
16:25 - so here you can see
16:27 - that if i want to debug this javascript
16:29 - file i have the option to click on this
16:31 - run and debug button which is going to
16:34 - create this launch json file which is
16:37 - the file basically we use
16:40 - to provide the debug configuration to uh
16:43 - our project right
16:45 - and from the next time when you uh click
16:48 - on the debug button here it's going to
16:51 - debug your code and
16:53 - you can
16:54 - just use this debugger to debug your
16:56 - code
16:57 - you can see i have created a big
16:59 - breakpoint here here here
17:02 - you will be able to see all the
17:04 - breakpoints in the breakpoints section
17:07 - if you want to
17:08 - remove all the breakpoints uh you can
17:11 - click on this button which says remove
17:13 - all breakpoints or you can deactivate
17:16 - the breakpoints also from here so you
17:18 - can
17:19 - have an overview of all your break
17:22 - points in all your files in your project
17:26 - using this breakpoints
17:28 - overview
17:30 - now you also have this extensions option
17:33 - here so when you click on the extensions
17:35 - option
17:37 - you can see
17:38 - if
17:39 - visual studio code doesn't come with the
17:42 - support of any language then it's going
17:45 - to provide you the option to download
17:48 - the extension for that language let's
17:50 - say
17:51 - i want to uh
17:53 - have the support for the python language
17:55 - which is the most popular
17:57 - language which we can develop on our
18:01 - visual studio code
18:02 - i can search for python here so i can
18:04 - just write python here
18:07 - and it's going to
18:08 - search all the extensions related to
18:11 - python which are popular you can see
18:14 - how many downloads were done for that
18:18 - package you can see for 48 million for
18:20 - python
18:21 - which is from microsoft when i click on
18:23 - this i can have more information about
18:26 - this package let me just press ctrl
18:28 - minus so you will be able to see this
18:31 - overview in a better way
18:33 - here you can see who has developed this
18:36 - extension you can see microsoft
18:38 - and if you see microsoft here that means
18:41 - it's developed by microsoft uh for you
18:44 - right and you can trust it you can also
18:46 - see the number of downloads for this
18:48 - extension
18:49 - you can click on the install button to
18:51 - install this extension
18:53 - and also
18:55 - when you scroll down you will be able to
18:57 - see how you can use this
19:00 - extension let's say i want to just
19:03 - search for the extensions for java
19:06 - and it's going to show me all the
19:08 - extensions related to java here right
19:11 - so you can search for all the extensions
19:14 - and then install these extensions which
19:16 - is going to
19:18 - help you to develop your code in a
19:21 - better way also you have this option
19:24 - for the account section so
19:26 - you can click on this turn on settings
19:28 - sync so you can just log in to your
19:32 - visual studio code and then when you use
19:35 - your visual studio code on any other
19:37 - computer and when you log in with the
19:39 - same visual studio code account
19:42 - your settings will be imported in your
19:45 - visual studio code on the different
19:47 - computer also
19:49 - you also have this settings option and
19:52 - when you click on the settings option
19:53 - you have
19:55 - this settings option here
19:57 - and you have you can change many
19:59 - settings related to
20:01 - visual studio code so you can see you
20:04 - have the main settings option
20:06 - which is going to open this kind of
20:08 - window and here you can change the
20:10 - settings related to text editor
20:12 - workbench window features application
20:15 - security and extensions right so you can
20:18 - see you can change the settings related
20:20 - to
20:21 - let's say text editor using this text
20:23 - editor option
20:25 - and when you scroll down you will be
20:27 - able to see all the options for the
20:29 - settings this is all about the visual
20:31 - studio code window you also have the run
20:34 - option so it also provides
20:37 - the
20:38 - run options let's say i want to just
20:40 - start the debugging of my javascript
20:42 - code i can do that using the start
20:44 - debugging button
20:46 - i also have the go button which is going
20:48 - to uh
20:50 - just redirect me to the definition
20:53 - declaration type definition
20:55 - of a particular code which i have
20:58 - highlighted
20:59 - i can also click on view option and then
21:02 - i have
21:03 - these more options here
21:06 - and then the selection option
21:09 - edit option which is like
21:12 - just cut copy paste and find replace
21:15 - related settings
21:17 - and if you want to update your visual
21:18 - studio code you can just click on check
21:21 - for updates on the help section and you
21:24 - can just update your visual studio code
21:27 - so let me close this window from here
21:30 - and close this window from here so let's
21:32 - say in my documents folder i have this
21:34 - java apps folder
21:36 - which already contains some java file
21:39 - and the compiled version of that file so
21:42 - when you are inside a project folder
21:45 - on your folder explorer you can right
21:47 - click here on your windows 11 operating
21:49 - system
21:50 - and then click on show more options here
21:52 - which is going to show you more options
21:55 - and you can see this option which is
21:58 - open with code so when you click on open
22:00 - with code
22:02 - it's going to open this folder on your
22:04 - visual studio code right so now
22:08 - i can develop java using my visual
22:10 - studio code right
22:12 - and when i open some folder and the
22:14 - support for that language is not
22:18 - installed on my visual studio code
22:20 - visual studio code always provides me
22:23 - these kind of
22:25 - information or warning
22:27 - which says do you want to install the
22:29 - recommended extensions for java right so
22:32 - if i choose to install all the
22:34 - recommended extensions which are
22:36 - recommended by visual studio code for us
22:39 - it's going to
22:41 - just install the extensions related to
22:43 - java
22:44 - and then i can easily use java on my
22:49 - visual studio code
22:51 - and i can develop java code on my visual
22:54 - studio code so this was
22:56 - a very a brief introduction about how
22:59 - you can install visual studio code and
23:01 - how you can use a visual studio code on
23:03 - your windows 11 operating system
23:06 - i hope you enjoyed this video and i will
23:08 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install and use visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system so let's start with the installation first so first of all open your favorite browser and search for visual studio code and the first link which will appear here will be code.visualstudio.com so i'm going to click on this link and once you are on this website you will be able to see uh this download for windows option here or you will be able to see this download button right and when you click on this arrow you will be able to see the download options for mac os windows and linux also so we just need to click on this download for windows button which is going to start the download of this vs code user setup.exe file it's around 76 megabyte at the time of making this video so just wait for the download to complete and once the download of this exe file is finished just click on this file and i'm going to minimize this browser so first of all you will see this license storms and agreement window so if you agree with those license terms and conditions just click on this i accept the agreement radio button and then click on next this will be the default location where visual studio code will be installed on your windows 11 operating system so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default otherwise you can click on this browse button and then select the location where you want to install visual studio code i'm going to just click on the next button now on this next window you will see select start menu folder just leave it as default which is visual studio code and then you can also check this checkbox which says don't create a startup menu folder and when you check this it's not going to create a startup menu folder but i want to create it so i will leave it as default and then click on next and here on the next window you will be asked to select the additional tasks so here i want to create the desktop icon so i'm going to check this checkbox also add open with code i want to add this option also and i want to add this option also which says add open with code action to windows explorer directory context menu i want that also right so i'm going to check all these check boxes and then click on next and then you will see the summary here just click on install which is going to start the installation of visual studio code at this point you just need to wait until this progress bar reaches to the 100 mark and once that's done you will be able to see uh this message completing the visual studio code setup also you can see the visual studio code shortcut has been created on my desktop so at this point just leave this checkbox as checked which is going to launch visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system just click on finish and it's going to launch visual studio code so as you can see for the first time when you start visual studio code you have the option to select few things you can choose which theme you want for your visual studio code so i'm going to leave it as dark mode otherwise you can also choose the light theme and then high contrast theme and there are multiple themes available for visual studio code so at this point your visual studio installation is pretty much finished but let me show you a few more things about visual studio code and let me also show you how you can use visual studio code for developing different programming languages so first of all when i open the command prompt by just clicking on the search icon and then just type cmd which is going to open the command prompt and in here when you type code and then press enter it's going to open visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system so you can open visual studio code from your command prompt from any folder wherever you want right now one more thing which you can do with your visual studio code so let's say i'm going to create a new folder on my desktop you can create this folder anywhere you want and then i'm going to name it as let's say sample folder and i want to open this folder using the command prompt right so i'm going to navigate to this folder using the command prompt let's say cd and then the folder is on my desktop right so i'm going to just cd to my desktop and then here i just need to cd once again to my sample folder right and when you type code space dot here it's going to open visual studio code so let me just press enter here so what it's going to do is it's going to open visual studio code and this folder will be opened right in the explorer here for the first time you just need to click on the yes i trust the author button and you can see visual studio has opened the sample folder on my visual studio code editor right now in here i can create files using this button which is for creating the files i can create the folder inside this sample folder i can also create files using this file option and i can also open some folder using this file option right so let me create a very simple file here so i can right click also and then click on new file here and then i can just type hello dot js here which is going to create the hello.js or javascript file now visual studio code is smart enough to understand that we have created a javascript file so you will be able to see this language here which is automatically selected for us which is javascript and visual studio comes with the support of javascript by default so when you type some javascript code here so const x is equal to let's say hello world here right so visual studio code is going to understand that you are writing the javascript code and it's going to provide you the intellisense for javascript so let's say i want to print this value of x and when i press co n for example it's going to show me the intellisense what i'm trying to write right so i can select console from here and then log so you can see i have multiple options which i can call on the console right so i want to just use a log here and then i'm going to just print the value of x so as you can see visual studio code comes with the support of javascript and many other languages by default so you don't even need to install any extra support for some languages right you can press ctrl s to save your code or you can just go to the file option and then click on save but control s is easier to do right now right now you can see that this font size is very small let's say i want to increase the font size of all the widgets on my visual studio code i just need to press ctrl and then plus option okay so just press ctrl and plus which is going to increase the font it's just going to increase the font size of all the widgets on your visual studio codes and then once again when you press control plus again you can see the font size of all the widgets is once again increased you can also say that we are doing the zoom option on visual studio code in order to reduce the font size you can press ctrl and then minus or hyphen option on your windows 11 so control and hyphen which is going to reduce the font size so i think this font size is okay for now for this video demonstration purposes now when you want to run this code so how you can run this code you have a few options if you are a fan of terminal or command prompt so you want to run your apps using the command prompt visual studio comes with the integrated terminal which you can use using this option which is called terminal so just click on terminal and then click on new terminal or you can press this option so on different keyboards you will see that this option changes right so i have a german keyboard so i have this ctrl shift loud but on your keyboard let's say for us you will see the different option here right so just click on new uh terminal here which is going to open the command prompt on the same folder in which you are working right now so you can see i'm working in the sample folder here is the sample folder and right now i am inside the sample folder in the command prompt right so from here i can run my code so let's say i want to run this code using node.js i can just write node here and then the name of the file which is hello.js and you can also see that visual studio code has opened the powershell editor for us you can see windows powershell so it's same like opening the powershell on your windows 11 operating system so when you just type a powershell here you can open powershell here on your windows 11 operating system so it's similar to using powershell on your visual studio code terminal now let's say you want to use different terminals so windows comes with powershell and the command prompt right so right now you can see powershell terminal is open if you want to change it to command prompt you just need to click on this small arrow here you can see this arrow and you can select which type of terminal you want so i'm going to choose the command prompt from here then it's going to open the command prompt so you can see we have opened multiple terminals and the list of all the terminals is going to appear on the left hand side so on the first terminal i have powershell open on the second terminal which is in the same folder i have command prompt opened i can also open let's say javascript debug terminal and it's going to open the javascript debug terminal for us which is essentially the powershell terminal in my case right you can also split your terminal so you can see you have the option to split the terminal so you can see when you just hover over the split terminal option here you can select which terminal you want to split so let's say i want to split the command prompt terminal you can see there are two uh command prompt terminals which are open and you will be able to see all these options here you can also close the terminal by just clicking on this delete icon here which is going to delete the terminal right so if you want to delete this powershell terminal you can just click on the delete uh icon on the powershell option so this was a brief introduction about terminal if you want to customize and configure more on your terminal you have all these options which you can use here so just play with all these options and see what they can do you also have this search option here so let's say i want to search something on visual studio code i can just press ctrl f keys and then it's going to show me this find option here and then i can find something let's say i want to search for all the logs right so i can just write log here and then you can see the this log is highlighted here right you can also replace this so let's say i want to replace this log with something else so let's say i want to replace this by dir so i can do this and then i can just click on this option which is going to replace all the occurrence of log in the current file or i can just select this option which is going to replace the first found item so whatever item is highlighted here it's going to replace that only so you can see right now three of three is highlighted i can just uh click on this arrow button and see where else this log appears on my file right now one of three uh occurrence is highlighted which is this one i can click on this uh button which is going to replace this highlighted log by dir if i press on this option it's going to replace all the occurrence of occurrences of log so you can see it's done that so this is how you can find and replace in your visual studio code editor now if you want to search in all the files inside your project folder you have this search option so let's say i have 10 javascript files inside this sample folder then you can just click on this option which can be used as a global search inside your project folder so let's say i want to just search for logs you can see i only have one file inside this sample folder so it has found all the occurrences of log but if my folder contains multiple javascript files then also it's going to show me the list of all the occurrences of log in my project folder in all the files and here also i can replace log by any other word or any other options here so this is for the global search you have the explorer here which is going to show you all the project files then you have the search option then the third option here is for the source control so let's say you have so let's say you have git installed or any other version control tool installed visual studio code is going to detect that tool and it's going to show you the changed file or if you make some changes in your code it's going to show you all the options related to the version control in this window right so you can commit your source code you can push your source code you can pull the source code from github or any other repository in the source control section right now the next option here is the run and debug option right so you can see run and debug so you have the option to debug your code using visual studio code so as i said visual studio code comes with support of some languages but if it doesn't come with the inherent support for some language you can install the support for that language also using packages and other options so here you can see that if i want to debug this javascript file i have the option to click on this run and debug button which is going to create this launch json file which is the file basically we use to provide the debug configuration to uh our project right and from the next time when you uh click on the debug button here it's going to debug your code and you can just use this debugger to debug your code you can see i have created a big breakpoint here here here you will be able to see all the breakpoints in the breakpoints section if you want to remove all the breakpoints uh you can click on this button which says remove all breakpoints or you can deactivate the breakpoints also from here so you can have an overview of all your break points in all your files in your project using this breakpoints overview now you also have this extensions option here so when you click on the extensions option you can see if visual studio code doesn't come with the support of any language then it's going to provide you the option to download the extension for that language let's say i want to uh have the support for the python language which is the most popular language which we can develop on our visual studio code i can search for python here so i can just write python here and it's going to search all the extensions related to python which are popular you can see how many downloads were done for that package you can see for 48 million for python which is from microsoft when i click on this i can have more information about this package let me just press ctrl minus so you will be able to see this overview in a better way here you can see who has developed this extension you can see microsoft and if you see microsoft here that means it's developed by microsoft uh for you right and you can trust it you can also see the number of downloads for this extension you can click on the install button to install this extension and also when you scroll down you will be able to see how you can use this extension let's say i want to just search for the extensions for java and it's going to show me all the extensions related to java here right so you can search for all the extensions and then install these extensions which is going to help you to develop your code in a better way also you have this option for the account section so you can click on this turn on settings sync so you can just log in to your visual studio code and then when you use your visual studio code on any other computer and when you log in with the same visual studio code account your settings will be imported in your visual studio code on the different computer also you also have this settings option and when you click on the settings option you have this settings option here and you have you can change many settings related to visual studio code so you can see you have the main settings option which is going to open this kind of window and here you can change the settings related to text editor workbench window features application security and extensions right so you can see you can change the settings related to let's say text editor using this text editor option and when you scroll down you will be able to see all the options for the settings this is all about the visual studio code window you also have the run option so it also provides the run options let's say i want to just start the debugging of my javascript code i can do that using the start debugging button i also have the go button which is going to uh just redirect me to the definition declaration type definition of a particular code which i have highlighted i can also click on view option and then i have these more options here and then the selection option edit option which is like just cut copy paste and find replace related settings and if you want to update your visual studio code you can just click on check for updates on the help section and you can just update your visual studio code so let me close this window from here and close this window from here so let's say in my documents folder i have this java apps folder which already contains some java file and the compiled version of that file so when you are inside a project folder on your folder explorer you can right click here on your windows 11 operating system and then click on show more options here which is going to show you more options and you can see this option which is open with code so when you click on open with code it's going to open this folder on your visual studio code right so now i can develop java using my visual studio code right and when i open some folder and the support for that language is not installed on my visual studio code visual studio code always provides me these kind of information or warning which says do you want to install the recommended extensions for java right so if i choose to install all the recommended extensions which are recommended by visual studio code for us it's going to just install the extensions related to java and then i can easily use java on my visual studio code and i can develop java code on my visual studio code so this was a very a brief introduction about how you can install visual studio code and how you can use a visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system i hope you enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
