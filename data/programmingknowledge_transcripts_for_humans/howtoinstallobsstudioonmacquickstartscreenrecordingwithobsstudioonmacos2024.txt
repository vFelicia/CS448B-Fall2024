03:30 - obio Studio tries to load new system
03:33 - extensions if you want to enable these
03:36 - extensions open the privacy and Security
03:39 - in the system settings so I'm going to
03:41 - click on open system settings here and
03:45 - then you can see uh this option which
03:47 - says system software from application
03:50 - OBS was blogged from loading so I'm
03:53 - going to click on allow here and once
03:56 - that's done I can just minimize this
03:58 - window so here you can see the OBS
04:01 - studio so when OBS Studio opens for the
04:03 - first time you can configure some
04:05 - settings uh using this Auto
04:07 - configuration wizard so here it says
04:11 - usage information optimize for streaming
04:14 - recording is secondary optimize just for
04:17 - recording I will not be streaming and
04:20 - then you also have I will only be using
04:23 - virtual camera so for now I want to use
04:27 - OBS studio for the screen recording so
04:29 - so I'm going to just select this option
04:31 - which says optimize just for recording I
04:33 - will not be streaming and then click on
04:37 - next here and on this next window you
04:39 - can select the video settings for now uh
04:42 - the base resolution is use current I'm
04:47 - going to just go with the default option
04:49 - here and FPS also I'm going to go with
04:52 - the default option and then click on
04:55 - next and then you have the final results
04:58 - so I'm going to click on apply settings
05:00 - here which is going to apply my settings
05:03 - into OBS Studio let me maximize uh this
05:08 - window so that it can use all my desktop
05:12 - uh screen now to capture your uh screen
05:15 - using OBS what you need to do is you
05:17 - need to go under the sources and then
05:19 - click on this plus icon which says add
05:22 - sources and then select Mac OS screen
05:25 - capture here and then you can leave this
05:28 - Mac screen capture as as uh default uh
05:31 - you can also change the name of this
05:34 - screen capture I'm going to leave it as
05:35 - default which is Mac screen capture and
05:37 - then click on
05:39 - okay now you can see the display uh
05:42 - capture option which is the method here
05:45 - so you can leave this as uh default and
05:48 - then you have this display option so you
05:52 - can see depending on your uh screen size
05:57 - of your Mac operating system it's going
05:58 - to show the display display option which
06:00 - is the default display in my case it's
06:04 - 1352 cross
06:06 - 878 so you need to remember this
06:09 - resolution because we we are going to
06:11 - use this in the video settings otherwise
06:15 - you will not be able to capture your
06:17 - full screen so this is
06:21 - 1352 878 in my case I'm going to click
06:25 - on okay here so once you are done you
06:28 - need to resize this screen according to
06:30 - the size of this OBS Studio screen so
06:33 - I'm going to just try to fit this uh
06:36 - screen in my OBS Studio screen so let me
06:40 - just resize this but sometimes it
06:43 - doesn't fit uh into this screen so as I
06:46 - said you need to just remember this
06:49 - screen resolution which is 1352 cross 8
06:53 - 78 in my case and then here you need to
06:57 - click on settings option in the general
07:00 - setting you can leave everything as
07:02 - default you need to go to the video
07:03 - settings here and you can see base
07:06 - canvas resolution is 1 1920 cross 1 80
07:12 - by default in my case so you need to
07:15 - change this to the resolution which we
07:18 - have seen right so in my case it was
07:22 - 1352 cross 878 so let me uh do that
07:28 - 878 and then then I can just paste the
07:33 - same resolution in the output scaled
07:36 - resolution also okay so once you are
07:39 - done I can click on okay and then you
07:43 - can verify this once again
07:46 - 1352
07:48 - 878 and once again you need to resize
07:52 - this window according to the size of
07:54 - your OBS studio and this time it's going
07:57 - to fit into into your OBS Studio screen
08:01 - right so you can see uh this red line
08:04 - here here here and here so your uh
08:09 - screen will be fully captured now right
08:13 - you can also set the output uh format
08:16 - settings so when you click on settings
08:18 - here and then click on output here in my

08:28 - to just select uh MP4 option here you
08:31 - can also select the audio uh output uh
08:34 - option so if you are using the mic or
08:37 - some other audio device you can select
08:40 - it from here so for example in my case
08:42 - I'm using this sh MV 7 I can select this
08:46 - if I want to use it for now I'm going to
08:48 - leave it as default but you can select
08:49 - it from here also in the output section
08:53 - you can see your recordings will be
08:55 - saved under your username for/ movies
09:00 - folder so this is the location where
