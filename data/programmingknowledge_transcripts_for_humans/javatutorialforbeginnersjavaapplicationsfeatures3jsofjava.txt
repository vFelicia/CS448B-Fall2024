00:00 - so in this video I will be talking about
00:02 - the theoretical part of the Java so in
00:05 - this video also we are not going to code
00:07 - anything uh so basically we are talking
00:10 - about the Java application what are the
00:12 - Java features and what are the three JS
00:15 - of the Java so I strongly recommend that
00:18 - you should watch this video if you are
00:20 - preparing for the interviews or any your
00:23 - college test so this will be helpful for
00:25 - you to clear out those examinations
00:29 - so what are we learning today so we'll
00:31 - be learning what is Java we will be
00:34 - discussing some applications of the Java
00:36 - and we will be seeing some features that
00:39 - makes the Java as a standout programming
00:42 - language and will at last we'll be
00:44 - covering the three JS of the Java which
00:46 - is jvm JRE and jdk
00:49 - so let's just get started okay
00:52 - so what is Java so Java is a programming
00:55 - language and a platform so Java is a
00:57 - high level robust object oriented and
00:59 - secure programming language
01:01 - so talking about the history of the Java
01:04 - the Java was developed by the sun
01:06 - Microsystems in the year 1995 and James
01:09 - Gosling is The Man Behind the Java and
01:12 - which who called called as the father of
01:14 - the Java before Java its name was Oak
01:18 - since the oak was already registered by
01:20 - a company so James Gosling and his team
01:23 - decided that we should change the name
01:25 - to from Oak to Java so that is the
01:28 - history about Java so let's just talk
01:30 - about the real life examples and
01:32 - applications where Java is used okay
01:35 - so Java is used in a wide range of
01:38 - fields okay so let's just discuss some
01:42 - some of them as so Java is used in
01:44 - desktop application so there's a Acrobat
01:47 - Reader media player your antivirus which
01:49 - you use in your system
01:51 - is built using the Java programming
01:53 - language and some of the web
01:55 - applications like IRCTC uh the railway
01:58 - resolution systems and the Java T point
02:01 - which is famous website
02:02 - wherein you can find the tutorials for
02:05 - the Java learning
02:07 - and Enterprises applications such as
02:09 - banking applications are built using the
02:12 - Java and strong backend is also created
02:15 - using the Java programming language
02:17 - and the mobile application and embedded
02:19 - system smart cards Robotics and the
02:22 - games are yet more fields which you can
02:26 - think Java is there
02:28 - okay so let's talk about the features of
02:31 - the Java so here you can see the picture
02:33 - where I have written all those
02:36 - features that Java has okay let's just
02:40 - talk some few of them so Java is simple
02:44 - so what makes the Java simple Java is
02:47 - very easy to learn and its syntax is
02:49 - Simple and Clean and easy to understand
02:51 - according to the sun Microsystems Java
02:54 - is a simple language because Java syntax
02:57 - is based on C plus plus so it it makes
03:00 - easier to a new programmer to learn it
03:03 - better and in faster way so Java has
03:06 - removed many complicated and rarely used
03:09 - features for example explicit pointers
03:11 - operator overloading Etc okay so there
03:15 - is no there is no need to unreference
03:19 - the object because there is an automated
03:21 - garbage collection is there in the Java
03:24 - okay so another feature is Java is
03:27 - object oriented so what is object
03:29 - oriented so object oriented is nothing
03:31 - but the everything in Java is an object
03:34 - object oriented means we organize our
03:36 - software as a combination of the
03:38 - different types of the object that
03:40 - incorporate the both Behavior so Java
03:43 - implements the oops Concepts such as
03:46 - class object inheritance polymorphism
03:49 - abstraction and encapsulation I will be
03:53 - covering all those groups Concepts in
03:55 - detail in the upcoming video lectures
03:57 - okay uh so talk let's talk about the one
04:01 - more feature here which is main feature
04:03 - I guess the Java is platform independent
04:06 - so what is Java platform Independence uh
04:09 - platform Independence means once you
04:11 - write your Java code that is the dot
04:14 - Java file
04:15 - and once you execute that file it
04:18 - creates the dot class file of that the
04:20 - Java program so what is dot class file
04:24 - so that dot class file is the byte code
04:26 - of the Java which you can run in any
04:29 - operating system so let's suppose
04:31 - Windows is there Mac OS is their Linux
04:34 - is there you can take that dot class
04:36 - file and you can run any of these
04:39 - platforms any of these wind operating
04:41 - system so that makes the Java as a
04:44 - platform independent language
04:46 - okay so enough talking about the
04:49 - features let's move on to the three JS
04:53 - of the Java so this is the most
04:55 - frequently asked questions in the
04:57 - interviews and your college examinations
04:59 - what is jdk what is JRE and what is jvm
05:04 - so let's just talk about it
05:06 - in detail okay so first I will be
05:09 - talking about jvm so here you can see
05:11 - the jvm okay so what is jvm jvm stands
05:15 - for Java virtual machine it is an
05:17 - abstract machine
05:19 - it is a it is a specification that
05:21 - provides a runtime environment in which
05:23 - Java byte code can be executed so as
05:27 - early I have told you the jot dot dot
05:30 - Java class file is converted into dot
05:33 - class file dot class file is the actual
05:35 - byte code that Java uses
05:38 - to run that code okay and then again
05:41 - that dot by dot class file is converted
05:44 - into machine understandable code okay so
05:47 - that part is handled by jvm so what jvm
05:51 - performs the task okay
05:53 - jvm loads the code it verifies your code
05:57 - it executes your code and provides the
05:59 - runtime environment to the user to
06:02 - execute the Java program
06:04 - okay so Jay let's just talk about JRE so
06:09 - what is JRE Jr stands for Java runtime
06:12 - environment it is a set of software
06:14 - tools which are used for the developing
06:16 - the Java applications it is used to
06:19 - provide the runtime environment it is
06:21 - implementation of the jvm it is
06:23 - physically exist it contains the set of
06:26 - libraries and other files that jvm uses
06:28 - at the runtime so here you can see jvm
06:32 - the set of libraries like jar Etc and
06:36 - other files together makes JRE so JRE so
06:42 - I hope you understand the JRE so let's
06:46 - move ahead and talk about jdk so jdk is
06:49 - an acronym for the Java development kit
06:51 - so till now we have learned jvm JRE and
06:55 - some development tools are there like
06:57 - Java C Java and all those things forms a
07:01 - jdk so you might have seen one software
07:04 - we have in install in our first video
07:06 - that is download jdk and this is the jdk
07:09 - so what contains inside a jdk is jvm JRE
07:13 - and the development tools which are
07:15 - required for the Java Apple Java
07:18 - applications to be built
07:20 - okay so Java jdk is a software
07:23 - development environment which is used to
07:25 - develop Java application and applets it
07:28 - physically exists it contains JRE plus
07:31 - development tools so as I told you JRE
07:34 - plus some development tools forms
07:37 - together a jdk and which we have
07:40 - installed in the first video
07:43 - so enough talking about theoretical part
07:45 - I hope you guys learn something about
07:49 - the theoretical part of the Java so in
07:52 - our upcoming videos we'll be starting to
07:54 - code in Java programming language and
07:57 - will be
07:59 - recording our first Java program in the
08:02 - upcoming videos

Cleaned transcript:

so in this video I will be talking about the theoretical part of the Java so in this video also we are not going to code anything uh so basically we are talking about the Java application what are the Java features and what are the three JS of the Java so I strongly recommend that you should watch this video if you are preparing for the interviews or any your college test so this will be helpful for you to clear out those examinations so what are we learning today so we'll be learning what is Java we will be discussing some applications of the Java and we will be seeing some features that
