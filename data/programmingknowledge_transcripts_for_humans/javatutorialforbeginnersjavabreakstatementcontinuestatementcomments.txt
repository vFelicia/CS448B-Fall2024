00:00 - hello and welcome back guys to the
00:01 - another video of the Java tutorial
00:03 - Series so guys this is the uh I guess
00:06 - last video of the control statements so
00:08 - wherein we will be talking about Java
00:10 - break Java continue and what are Java
00:13 - comments okay so let's just get started
00:17 - okay so what is Java break so Java break
00:20 - is a statement which is used to break a
00:22 - loop or a switch statement it breaks the
00:25 - current flow of the program at specified
00:27 - condition in case of the inner loop it
00:30 - breaks only the inner loop okay so here
00:33 - is a
00:34 - diagrammatic representation here you can
00:36 - see one Loop is going on it it is
00:41 - iterating and one condition is defined
00:43 - inside that Loop and if that condition
00:45 - becomes true uh we will declare a break
00:49 - statement there and it will break the
00:51 - flow of the loop and it will terminate
00:54 - that Loop okay and whenever that
00:57 - condition is evaluated as false the loop
00:59 - will again go and iterate iterate
01:01 - iterate until the specified condition
01:03 - becomes false okay
01:05 - so what is Java continue okay so Java
01:09 - continue statement is used to continue
01:11 - the loop it continues the current flow
01:13 - of the program and skips the remaining
01:15 - code at a specified condition in case of
01:18 - an inner loop it will continue the inner
01:20 - loop only okay so we'll be uh talking in
01:23 - depth when we are going to code this
01:25 - Java continue
01:27 - and at last Java comments are there so
01:30 - what are the documents the Java comments
01:32 - are the statements in a program that are
01:34 - not executed by a compiler and an
01:36 - interpreter so basically there are three
01:38 - types of the Java comments one is single
01:41 - line command multi-line comment and
01:42 - documentation command so what is single
01:44 - line comment the single line comment is
01:46 - used to comment only one line so to
01:49 - declare a comment inside Java Java
01:51 - program we will just write two forward
01:54 - slashes are there so when you when you
01:57 - declare two two forward slashes and
01:59 - after that whatever you you will write
02:01 - that will be interpreted interpreted as
02:03 - a comment in Java okay so what is
02:06 - multi-line the multi-line comment is
02:08 - used to comment a multiple lines of the
02:10 - code so when you when we are you are
02:12 - going to comment out the multiple lines
02:15 - of the code in Java then you can use
02:18 - multi-line code multi-line comments
02:20 - sorry and third one is documentation
02:22 - command so documentation comment is used
02:25 - to create a documentation API to create
02:28 - documentation API you need to use Java
02:30 - doc tool so we'll be discussing more
02:33 - about documentation uh comments in our
02:36 - upcoming videos when we are writing some
02:39 - code that is a production level code
02:41 - okay so let's code it
02:44 - now it's I will come here inside my IDE
02:47 - and I will create one Java class name
02:51 - break
02:54 - okay and let me just increase the font
02:58 - size
02:59 - and I will tell you and give you one
03:02 - simple example of the break okay
03:05 - and here I am writing one for Loop which
03:08 - will iterate when I is equals to 1 and I
03:13 - is less than equals to 10 and each time
03:16 - my Loop is increment ice value is
03:18 - incrementing by one
03:20 - okay so inside this
03:24 - sorry guys I'll get I'm getting errors
03:27 - because I forgot to
03:30 - write the main method and I should write
03:33 - all this code inside the main method my
03:35 - bad
03:36 - and inside this for loop I will declare
03:39 - one if statement and I will write that
03:42 - when I is equals to equals to 5
03:46 - simply break
03:49 - okay
03:50 - and other than that
03:52 - if I come out of this Loop
03:56 - I will print the value of the eye okay
04:01 - now if I click on run
04:04 - so here you can see one two three four
04:08 - is going to print it on the screen and
04:10 - when the value value of the I is
04:12 - incremented and when the value of the is
04:13 - becomes 5 it will check whether the 5 is
04:16 - less than 10 it yes it come inside the
04:19 - loop and it will check I is equal to
04:20 - equal to 5 yes it will break the loop it
04:24 - will break the for Loop and it will get
04:26 - out of that Loop so this the this is the
04:29 - situation where you can use the for Loop
04:31 - inside Java okay
04:37 - okay so we have discussed about break
04:40 - now
04:41 - we will see what is
04:45 - continue in Java okay
04:48 - so let me just copy out this code
04:51 - because I need this okay and add this I
04:55 - will instead of writing break I will
04:58 - write
04:59 - continue okay and I will
05:02 - I will execute the same code okay so
05:05 - here you can see
05:07 - what is going to get printed on the
05:09 - console is one two three four and five
05:12 - is skipped and six seven eight nine ten
05:16 - is printed on the console why so when
05:19 - the value of the is becomes 5 when I is
05:22 - equal to equal to 5 this if condition
05:24 - gets evaluated as true and continue this
05:28 - line number 11 is executed and what will
05:31 - continue will do it will skip that
05:34 - iteration for that Loop it will not
05:36 - execute any of the code after the line
05:39 - number 11 and it will skip that Loop and
05:41 - it will go for the incrementing of the
05:43 - value of the I and iel's value become 6
05:45 - and 6 is less than 10 and that's why 6A
05:48 - is going to get printed on the console
05:49 - okay so continue is used basically for
05:52 - to skip a particular iteration inside a
05:55 - loop
05:56 - okay so I hope you guys have understood
05:58 - this
06:00 - continue so last topic that we have
06:04 - remaining is Java comments
06:07 - okay so let me just give you some
06:10 - example of the comments so as you can
06:14 - see these are the single line comments
06:16 - okay so here uh comments and I will just
06:20 - explain you okay so this is uh
06:25 - single line
06:28 - comment
06:30 - in Java
06:32 - right now my ID is throwing so much
06:35 - error because this is not a Java code
06:38 - this is just a simple English statement
06:41 - so if I want to comment this out I will
06:44 - just come here and just put two forward
06:48 - slashes and this that this becomes a
06:51 - single line comment inside Java okay
06:55 - so let's suppose we have to declare a
06:58 - multi-line comment Okay so
07:01 - I will write like this this is a
07:06 - multi
07:08 - line
07:11 - comment
07:13 - Angel so here two lines are there line
07:17 - number 17 and line number 18 are there
07:19 - that we have to comment so in that case
07:21 - we will write one forward slash followed
07:24 - by one asterisk and after when the at
07:29 - line number 18th end will write asterisk
07:33 - and one forward slash so guys this is
07:36 - the example of the multi-line comments
07:38 - inside Java so
07:42 - now it when we talk about the
07:45 - documentation comment there are a lot
07:49 - more example of the document coming
07:50 - documentation comments are there that is
07:53 - at author add code at version tag so
07:57 - these are some tags which are used in a
07:58 - multi-line command we will be discussing
08:00 - it in our upcoming videos when we saw uh
08:03 - some high level hard level uh Java
08:06 - programs and in that we will create a
08:09 - documentation comments okay so that is
08:13 - it for this video guys and now we have
08:16 - officially
08:17 - uh discussed all the topics which are
08:21 - comes under the control statements in
08:22 - Java so in the next class onward we will
08:25 - be starting our oops Concepts in Java
08:28 - and one more thing guys uh I'll be
08:31 - giving you this exercise number two in
08:33 - upcoming videos depending uh it the
08:36 - question that are asked in this exercise
08:38 - is whatever I tell I taught you to form
08:42 - till till now then on that on those
08:45 - topics that is for Loop while loop do
08:47 - while Loops all these topics requires as
08:50 - a prerequisite to solve that exercise so
08:52 - I hope guys I hope you guys will uh
08:55 - solve that exercise and meet you soon
08:57 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial Series so guys this is the uh I guess last video of the control statements so wherein we will be talking about Java break Java continue and what are Java comments okay so let's just get started okay so what is Java break so Java break is a statement which is used to break a loop or a switch statement it breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition in case of the inner loop it breaks only the inner loop okay so here is a diagrammatic representation here you can see one Loop is going on it it is iterating and one condition is defined inside that Loop and if that condition becomes true uh we will declare a break statement there and it will break the flow of the loop and it will terminate that Loop okay and whenever that condition is evaluated as false the loop will again go and iterate iterate iterate until the specified condition becomes false okay so what is Java continue okay so Java continue statement is used to continue the loop it continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at a specified condition in case of an inner loop it will continue the inner loop only okay so we'll be uh talking in depth when we are going to code this Java continue and at last Java comments are there so what are the documents the Java comments are the statements in a program that are not executed by a compiler and an interpreter so basically there are three types of the Java comments one is single line command multiline comment and documentation command so what is single line comment the single line comment is used to comment only one line so to declare a comment inside Java Java program we will just write two forward slashes are there so when you when you declare two two forward slashes and after that whatever you you will write that will be interpreted interpreted as a comment in Java okay so what is multiline the multiline comment is used to comment a multiple lines of the code so when you when we are you are going to comment out the multiple lines of the code in Java then you can use multiline code multiline comments sorry and third one is documentation command so documentation comment is used to create a documentation API to create documentation API you need to use Java doc tool so we'll be discussing more about documentation uh comments in our upcoming videos when we are writing some code that is a production level code okay so let's code it now it's I will come here inside my IDE and I will create one Java class name break okay and let me just increase the font size and I will tell you and give you one simple example of the break okay and here I am writing one for Loop which will iterate when I is equals to 1 and I is less than equals to 10 and each time my Loop is increment ice value is incrementing by one okay so inside this sorry guys I'll get I'm getting errors because I forgot to write the main method and I should write all this code inside the main method my bad and inside this for loop I will declare one if statement and I will write that when I is equals to equals to 5 simply break okay and other than that if I come out of this Loop I will print the value of the eye okay now if I click on run so here you can see one two three four is going to print it on the screen and when the value value of the I is incremented and when the value of the is becomes 5 it will check whether the 5 is less than 10 it yes it come inside the loop and it will check I is equal to equal to 5 yes it will break the loop it will break the for Loop and it will get out of that Loop so this the this is the situation where you can use the for Loop inside Java okay okay so we have discussed about break now we will see what is continue in Java okay so let me just copy out this code because I need this okay and add this I will instead of writing break I will write continue okay and I will I will execute the same code okay so here you can see what is going to get printed on the console is one two three four and five is skipped and six seven eight nine ten is printed on the console why so when the value of the is becomes 5 when I is equal to equal to 5 this if condition gets evaluated as true and continue this line number 11 is executed and what will continue will do it will skip that iteration for that Loop it will not execute any of the code after the line number 11 and it will skip that Loop and it will go for the incrementing of the value of the I and iel's value become 6 and 6 is less than 10 and that's why 6A is going to get printed on the console okay so continue is used basically for to skip a particular iteration inside a loop okay so I hope you guys have understood this continue so last topic that we have remaining is Java comments okay so let me just give you some example of the comments so as you can see these are the single line comments okay so here uh comments and I will just explain you okay so this is uh single line comment in Java right now my ID is throwing so much error because this is not a Java code this is just a simple English statement so if I want to comment this out I will just come here and just put two forward slashes and this that this becomes a single line comment inside Java okay so let's suppose we have to declare a multiline comment Okay so I will write like this this is a multi line comment Angel so here two lines are there line number 17 and line number 18 are there that we have to comment so in that case we will write one forward slash followed by one asterisk and after when the at line number 18th end will write asterisk and one forward slash so guys this is the example of the multiline comments inside Java so now it when we talk about the documentation comment there are a lot more example of the document coming documentation comments are there that is at author add code at version tag so these are some tags which are used in a multiline command we will be discussing it in our upcoming videos when we saw uh some high level hard level uh Java programs and in that we will create a documentation comments okay so that is it for this video guys and now we have officially uh discussed all the topics which are comes under the control statements in Java so in the next class onward we will be starting our oops Concepts in Java and one more thing guys uh I'll be giving you this exercise number two in upcoming videos depending uh it the question that are asked in this exercise is whatever I tell I taught you to form till till now then on that on those topics that is for Loop while loop do while Loops all these topics requires as a prerequisite to solve that exercise so I hope guys I hope you guys will uh solve that exercise and meet you soon thank you
