00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:05 - this video we will learn about data
00:06 - types in
00:08 - JavaScript so there are basically five
00:11 - data types in JavaScript which is
00:14 - strings numbers Boolean arrays and
00:18 - objects arrays and object we will learn
00:21 - in further videos and in this video we
00:24 - will discuss about string numbers and
00:27 - Boolean data types so to declare a
00:32 - variable in JavaScript you need to uh
00:35 - declare it with a keyword called VAR and
00:39 - it's like a data type in JavaScript so
00:42 - unlike in uh other languages like Java
00:46 - or C++ you literally give the data type
00:49 - like int or buol or string here but in
00:54 - JavaScript you give just this uh keyword
00:58 - called VAR and then your variable name
01:02 - so for example my number and then you
01:05 - can initialize this variable by some
01:08 - value for example 10 and by
01:10 - initialization JavaScript deduce the
01:13 - data type of a variable so here it's
01:16 - initialized with a number so this data
01:20 - type of this variable will be a number
01:23 - right now let's print this value so
01:27 - there is a function in JavaScript which
01:29 - is called alert and it takes one
01:31 - argument it can be a string or a number
01:35 - or anything right so to print a variable
01:40 - you just need to copy it and pass it as
01:42 - an argument of this alert function and
01:46 - save your code and refresh your web
01:51 - page and it gives you this number in the
01:55 - form of alert okay now this number can
01:58 - be of different types for example if you
02:01 - want to initialize uh this variable by a
02:03 - decimal number or floating point you can
02:07 - use it something like 10. 213 or some
02:10 - decimal points right or it can be a
02:13 - exponent value so you can uh initialize
02:16 - it something like 10
02:19 - E5 which means 10 into 10 to the power 5
02:24 - so let's save it and refresh our web
02:27 - page and it will give you this value
02:31 - right or you can uh do something like 10
02:35 - e minus 5 which means 10 * 10 to the^ -
02:40 - 5 and save it and refresh your web page
02:44 - and it gives you this decimal value
02:47 - right now to declare a Boolean value in
02:51 - JavaScript you do the same so V the
02:55 - variable name my Bool and then you
02:59 - declare it with true or false so it can
03:02 - be true or it can be a false value okay
03:08 - so a Boolean is a data type which can
03:11 - contain either true or false so this
03:14 - time we are going to initialize it by
03:17 - true for example and just pass it in
03:20 - here in the alert argument and save it
03:24 - and refresh your web page and it will
03:26 - give you true okay and if you would have
03:30 - initialize it by false then it will give
03:33 - you false so refresh your web page and
03:36 - it gives false here okay now let's see
03:40 - how we can declare a string in
03:44 - JavaScript so once again give VAR and
03:47 - then give the name to your variable for
03:50 - example my string and then is equal to
03:55 - and in double quotes whatever you write
03:58 - in between the double quote it will be
04:01 - your string right so for example my name
04:05 - is whatever right and uh just pass this
04:10 - variable in the alert function and save
04:13 - it and refresh your web page and it
04:16 - gives you this uh string value here okay
04:20 - now for example you want to uh display a
04:24 - string with some double quotation or
04:27 - something so for example something like
04:31 - this
04:33 - okay and this will give you the error so
04:37 - when I save it and when I refresh my web
04:41 - page it gives me nothing and it gives me
04:44 - the syntax error and it says missing
04:48 - semicolon before statement okay and you
04:51 - can even go to uh this uh error by
04:55 - clicking here on the right hand side and
04:59 - it shows me this line okay so this error
05:02 - is coming from this line we know right
05:05 - and why this error is coming
05:08 - because these uh double quotes you
05:11 - cannot use inside your string variable
05:15 - so you can you know uh add any string
05:19 - inside your double quotes at the left
05:23 - hand side and the right hand side but
05:25 - whenever you try to uh include these
05:28 - double quat in inside a string it will
05:31 - give you an error and it's obvious
05:34 - because JavaScript will think that this
05:37 - string starts here and ends here okay
05:40 - and whatever comes after it doesn't know
05:43 - what is it so to uh you know avoid this
05:47 - error what you can do is you can use a
05:51 - operator called Escape operator okay and
05:56 - you can use it something like this so
05:59 - you you use back slash just before your
06:02 - double quotation symbol so here and here
06:06 - and this means whatever comes after this
06:09 - double slash it will be considered as a
06:13 - part of the string okay so save it and
06:17 - refresh your web page and now it will
06:20 - give you the answer so my and it this
06:23 - quotation and then the name okay
06:27 - something like this now there is a
06:29 - keyword in JavaScript which is called
06:32 - type off and this keyword whatever you
06:36 - will write after this for example I'm uh
06:40 - writing this variable name my string
06:42 - after this type of keywords separated by
06:46 - one space then it will give you the type
06:50 - of this keyword okay so let's save it
06:54 - and let's see what it returns so I will
06:56 - refresh it and it gives me string so
06:59 - this keyword gives you the data type of
07:03 - your variable okay so you can check what
07:07 - this variable is so my Bool and save it
07:12 - and refresh your web page once again it
07:14 - will give you Boolean okay and once
07:18 - again I will pass this my number here
07:20 - and save my code and refresh my web
07:25 - page and it gives me this number so you
07:29 - can find the data type of a variable or
07:32 - some value using this type of keyword so
07:37 - in this way you can use data types in
07:39 - JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about data types in JavaScript so there are basically five data types in JavaScript which is strings numbers Boolean arrays and objects arrays and object we will learn in further videos and in this video we will discuss about string numbers and Boolean data types so to declare a variable in JavaScript you need to uh declare it with a keyword called VAR and it's like a data type in JavaScript so unlike in uh other languages like Java or C++ you literally give the data type like int or buol or string here but in JavaScript you give just this uh keyword called VAR and then your variable name so for example my number and then you can initialize this variable by some value for example 10 and by initialization JavaScript deduce the data type of a variable so here it's initialized with a number so this data type of this variable will be a number right now let's print this value so there is a function in JavaScript which is called alert and it takes one argument it can be a string or a number or anything right so to print a variable you just need to copy it and pass it as an argument of this alert function and save your code and refresh your web page and it gives you this number in the form of alert okay now this number can be of different types for example if you want to initialize uh this variable by a decimal number or floating point you can use it something like 10. 213 or some decimal points right or it can be a exponent value so you can uh initialize it something like 10 E5 which means 10 into 10 to the power 5 so let's save it and refresh our web page and it will give you this value right or you can uh do something like 10 e minus 5 which means 10 * 10 to the^ 5 and save it and refresh your web page and it gives you this decimal value right now to declare a Boolean value in JavaScript you do the same so V the variable name my Bool and then you declare it with true or false so it can be true or it can be a false value okay so a Boolean is a data type which can contain either true or false so this time we are going to initialize it by true for example and just pass it in here in the alert argument and save it and refresh your web page and it will give you true okay and if you would have initialize it by false then it will give you false so refresh your web page and it gives false here okay now let's see how we can declare a string in JavaScript so once again give VAR and then give the name to your variable for example my string and then is equal to and in double quotes whatever you write in between the double quote it will be your string right so for example my name is whatever right and uh just pass this variable in the alert function and save it and refresh your web page and it gives you this uh string value here okay now for example you want to uh display a string with some double quotation or something so for example something like this okay and this will give you the error so when I save it and when I refresh my web page it gives me nothing and it gives me the syntax error and it says missing semicolon before statement okay and you can even go to uh this uh error by clicking here on the right hand side and it shows me this line okay so this error is coming from this line we know right and why this error is coming because these uh double quotes you cannot use inside your string variable so you can you know uh add any string inside your double quotes at the left hand side and the right hand side but whenever you try to uh include these double quat in inside a string it will give you an error and it's obvious because JavaScript will think that this string starts here and ends here okay and whatever comes after it doesn't know what is it so to uh you know avoid this error what you can do is you can use a operator called Escape operator okay and you can use it something like this so you you use back slash just before your double quotation symbol so here and here and this means whatever comes after this double slash it will be considered as a part of the string okay so save it and refresh your web page and now it will give you the answer so my and it this quotation and then the name okay something like this now there is a keyword in JavaScript which is called type off and this keyword whatever you will write after this for example I'm uh writing this variable name my string after this type of keywords separated by one space then it will give you the type of this keyword okay so let's save it and let's see what it returns so I will refresh it and it gives me string so this keyword gives you the data type of your variable okay so you can check what this variable is so my Bool and save it and refresh your web page once again it will give you Boolean okay and once again I will pass this my number here and save my code and refresh my web page and it gives me this number so you can find the data type of a variable or some value using this type of keyword so in this way you can use data types in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment
