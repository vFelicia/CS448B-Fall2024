00:00 - hello everyone welcome to another
00:01 - tutorial on vue.js
00:03 - so you can refer to this getup link that
00:05 - is github.com
00:07 - pro software development learn view you
00:09 - will get all the codes related to this
00:11 - series
00:12 - video series on this repository the
00:14 - title this
00:15 - video is working with the view component
00:17 - and we will learn how to bind
00:19 - id data and methods inside of your
00:21 - component
00:22 - so let's get started with this tutorial
00:24 - before i start i'll give you a quick
00:26 - reminder
00:27 - how view js works so basically vue.js
00:32 - has a has a component
00:37 - component uh which is a view component
00:40 - okay i'll say a view js has a view
00:42 - component
00:44 - uh which refers to the id
00:47 - of the html html page
00:52 - to render it uh why we refer to id
00:55 - because its id is a unique thing so we
00:58 - don't have any conflict
01:00 - that which we don't have in ambiguity to
01:03 - avoid the ambiguity we have an id that
01:05 - is unique
01:06 - for the html element so it helps the
01:09 - view component to
01:10 - render on the html part using an id so
01:13 - that's pretty simple
01:15 - now what you can do you will create a
01:18 - new html page that
01:20 - index2.html in the previous tutorial i
01:22 - had created index1.html and you can
01:25 - add the view js script inside your it
01:28 - inside your body tag but make sure that
01:31 - it should be at the end of the body tag
01:33 - not before it
01:34 - so this makes like it will perfectly
01:37 - render everything
01:39 - so the title is learn youtube and we
01:41 - will give a create a view component
01:44 - constant
01:48 - view component to okay i'll say
01:51 - constant view
01:54 - component 2
01:58 - is equal to new view it will call the
02:00 - view constructor
02:01 - and the view constructor has a json
02:03 - object perfectly fine
02:05 - so now you can see it has a json object
02:07 - now i'll what i'll do
02:09 - i'll press enter it has three things
02:11 - that element
02:13 - which will have the id
02:17 - and then it will have a data
02:21 - which will be in in itself a json object
02:26 - and then it will have methods
02:31 - uh methods will be also a json object so
02:34 - it will
02:34 - remember all those three all these three
02:36 - things to put
02:38 - you are perfectly fine with the uh your
02:40 - view component
02:42 - so inside this i'll put a counter
02:48 - is equal to 0 and inside this
02:52 - i'll call the method uh i'll call it
02:57 - increment counter
03:01 - okay and what i'll do uh
03:04 - i'll call them at a method increment
03:06 - counter and
03:08 - assuming just for resuming the case that
03:11 - forget this as a view component uh
03:13 - treat it as a treat this as a class
03:16 - so if this is a class if this is a class
03:19 - so what you can that if this is a class
03:22 - and if you want to access the data
03:24 - of this class you can you access this
03:27 - wire this pointer
03:28 - so this dot
03:31 - counter
03:35 - plus plus so every time i click on it
03:37 - i'll increase the counter
03:39 - so to show this on the front end what
03:43 - i'll do i'll make a div
03:45 - div id is equal to my app too
03:50 - and then i'll close the day
03:53 - perfectly fine and what i'll do i'll
03:58 - i'll create a counter variable
04:01 - using the handles and i'll give this as
04:04 - h1 tag so i hope this is fine
04:08 - now what i'll do uh i'll
04:11 - what i'll do now what i'll do i have to
04:15 - refer this element to this id that
04:18 - is hash my app 2
04:22 - now i'll go to the page
04:25 - and i'll refresh this it says zero as a
04:27 - counter perfectly fine
04:29 - but uh what does does something happen
04:32 - on the click
04:32 - nothing happens because for this i have
04:34 - to define a
04:36 - a click function which can be defined as
04:38 - add did it
04:39 - click is equal to increment
04:43 - counter so when i click on this
04:48 - it will increment the count
04:51 - here i'll refresh this page and
04:54 - when i click this here you can see the
04:57 - count gets increased
04:58 - one by one by one so this is how you
05:01 - increment the counter
05:03 - uh by this function that is at the click
05:05 - and the red click function
05:07 - you can achieve the same using v on
05:10 - click functionality as well
05:12 - okay now i'll show you a small example
05:15 - uh
05:16 - let me add another thing that is
05:19 - text is equal to hello
05:23 - world that is hello world
05:27 - and what you can do also you can add a
05:31 - flag is equal to false
05:36 - but you can click on flag is equal to
05:40 - true
05:42 - so what you can do you can call a method
05:46 - hide
05:49 - hide method and
05:52 - you what you can do a hide method can
05:56 - will change this flag okay
05:59 - this if
06:02 - the if condition here it will change
06:05 - that
06:06 - if this dot
06:09 - flag is equal is equal to true
06:13 - then this dot flag is equal to false
06:20 - now this would change our flag if this
06:23 - dot flag is equal is equal to true then
06:25 - this dot flag is equal to false
06:28 - and how do you want to click
06:31 - that you can change this to okay first
06:34 - i'll show you one thing
06:35 - i'll change this to text
06:41 - okay perfectly fine now
06:45 - what i'll do i'll comment this
06:48 - out so the this code remains as well
06:52 - and okay actually there's no need to
06:55 - comment so
06:56 - let me remind this as it is so when i
06:59 - refresh this page
07:02 - uh okay this is the previous code
07:04 - working so as soon as i click the
07:06 - counter gets entered
07:07 - incremented so this is the previous code
07:09 - working when i refresh this
07:10 - page the new code gets our display so we
07:13 - get a text hello world
07:14 - but what i want to do i want to hide
07:16 - this on click
07:18 - so what i'll do i click
07:21 - hide method if this dot flag is equal to
07:24 - equal to true then this dot flag is
07:26 - equal to false
07:27 - and what i'll do here that
07:30 - and the on at the right click function
07:33 - i will call
07:36 - hide method perfectly fine
07:40 - but i'll put another condition that v
07:44 - if is equal to flat
07:47 - if this is true then i show this heading
07:50 - else
07:52 - if this is true then i show
07:55 - okay if it's false then i don't show and
07:58 - when this will turn
07:59 - to chain turn to false when i click the
08:02 - hide method
08:04 - okay let me refresh this page i click
08:07 - here you go it's it's been hidden and
08:10 - how you can get back to this
08:12 - you can right click here and click on
08:15 - inspect
08:16 - so this would open the chrome inspector
08:18 - tools and
08:19 - inside this what you can do you can
08:22 - refer to this view component
08:26 - what you will do view
08:31 - okay you can refer this view component
08:34 - to
08:34 - dollar data dot flag which will return
08:38 - your the existing
08:39 - value okay so what you can do
08:43 - just a second sorry
08:50 - i'll click on console view component
08:54 - to dollar data
08:57 - dollar flag which is false
09:01 - and i'll change this to true
09:04 - and i'll get the value back when i
09:07 - change this to false
09:08 - it gets hidden again so the true false
09:11 - talk value was
09:12 - done by this hide method functionality
09:15 - okay so thank you everyone for watching
09:18 - this tutorial thank you

hello everyone welcome to another tutorial on vue.js so you can refer to this getup link that is github.com pro software development learn view you will get all the codes related to this series video series on this repository the title this video is working with the view component and we will learn how to bind id data and methods inside of your component so let's get started with this tutorial before i start i'll give you a quick reminder how view js works so basically vue.js has a has a component component uh which is a view component okay i'll say a view js has a view component uh which refers to the id of the html html page to render it uh why we refer to id because its id is a unique thing so we don't have any conflict that which we don't have in ambiguity to avoid the ambiguity we have an id that is unique for the html element so it helps the view component to render on the html part using an id so that's pretty simple now what you can do you will create a new html page that

component 2 is equal to new view it will call the view constructor and the view constructor has a json object perfectly fine so now you can see it has a json object now i'll what i'll do i'll press enter it has three things that element which will have the id and then it will have a data which will be in in itself a json object and then it will have methods uh methods will be also a json object so it will remember all those three all these three things to put you are perfectly fine with the uh your view component so inside this i'll put a counter is equal to 0 and inside this i'll call the method uh i'll call it increment counter okay and what i'll do uh i'll call them at a method increment counter and assuming just for resuming the case that forget this as a view component uh treat it as a treat this as a class so if this is a class if this is a class so what you can that if this is a class and if you want to access the data of this class you can you access this wire this pointer so this dot counter plus plus so every time i click on it i'll increase the counter so to show this on the front end what i'll do i'll make a div div id is equal to my app too and then i'll close the day perfectly fine and what i'll do i'll i'll create a counter variable using the handles and i'll give this as h1 tag so i hope this is fine now what i'll do uh i'll what i'll do now what i'll do i have to refer this element to this id that is hash my app 2 now i'll go to the page and i'll refresh this it says zero as a counter perfectly fine but uh what does does something happen on the click nothing happens because for this i have to define a a click function which can be defined as add did it click is equal to increment counter so when i click on this it will increment the count here i'll refresh this page and when i click this here you can see the count gets increased one by one by one so this is how you increment the counter uh by this function that is at the click and the red click function you can achieve the same using v on click functionality as well okay now i'll show you a small example uh let me add another thing that is text is equal to hello world that is hello world and what you can do also you can add a flag is equal to false but you can click on flag is equal to true so what you can do you can call a method hide hide method and you what you can do a hide method can will change this flag okay this if the if condition here it will change that if this dot flag is equal is equal to true then this dot flag is equal to false now this would change our flag if this dot flag is equal is equal to true then this dot flag is equal to false and how do you want to click that you can change this to okay first i'll show you one thing i'll change this to text okay perfectly fine now what i'll do i'll comment this out so the this code remains as well and okay actually there's no need to comment so let me remind this as it is so when i refresh this page uh
