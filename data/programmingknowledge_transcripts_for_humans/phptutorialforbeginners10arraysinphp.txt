00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - array in your PHP code so first of all
00:08 - what is an array array is the collection
00:12 - of similar data so for example you want
00:16 - a collection of names you cannot save
00:19 - all the names in a single variable but
00:22 - whenever you use array you will be able
00:24 - to save multiple values of same data
00:29 - type in
00:30 - a single variable so array is a
00:34 - collection of values basically now let's
00:37 - see how we can declare arrays in
00:41 - PHP uh the Declaration is same for array
00:44 - as the variable you just start with your
00:47 - end symbol and for example I want to
00:50 - make an array of
00:52 - names and then you just give this equal
00:56 - to sign and then tell PHP that it's it's
01:00 - an array by
01:02 - keyword
01:04 - array not here
01:10 - but okay and then in these two brackets
01:15 - you give the values to the array okay so
01:19 - for example uh the names can
01:23 - be Mark and uh bear in mind if this is a
01:29 - string data type because names can by
01:32 - Logic are some string data types so just
01:36 - if it's a string data type just include
01:38 - this with in the single quotes as we
01:41 - have seen in the string variables right
01:43 - and second name can
01:46 - be
01:48 - John and third name can be simple
01:54 - name Bob for
01:57 - example and then
02:00 - how for examp okay first of all so you
02:05 - have provided three values in the array
02:09 - now this these uh values you have
02:13 - provided are called elements of the
02:16 - array okay so this is one Element this
02:19 - is second element and this is third
02:21 - element so this is called element of the
02:23 - array now the position of these uh these
02:28 - values or these elements is also
02:30 - important and the position of
02:34 - these values or elements are called key
02:38 - or index and position this key or index
02:42 - starts from zero okay so always always
02:47 - remember that these element key or index
02:51 - starts from zero one and two this is the
02:54 - position at which they are stored in the
02:58 - array now in order to print this what
03:03 - you just need to do is Echo and you can
03:07 - just use your
03:09 - name with of course this and symbol and
03:14 - you can use these square brackets to
03:19 - represent the position which you want to
03:21 - print so this is the zero position first
03:25 - position and second position because
03:26 - index or key starts from zero so for
03:30 - example I want to print the name John I
03:33 - will just Echo names and with a
03:37 - key one right save it and I will just
03:43 - run this and it shows John in a similar
03:47 - way I can print Mark save it and just
03:52 - refresh it it will be Mark or I can just
03:57 - print Bob also
04:00 - okay I will refresh it and you will be
04:02 - able to see
04:04 - for now you can also assign value to the
04:08 - array it's not necessary that you need
04:10 - to only uh you know give the values at
04:14 - the time of initialization of this uh
04:16 - name array you can uh assign these value
04:21 - at run time also or whatever for for
04:24 - example you want to assign some value to
04:27 - the array you can just uh use this name
04:32 - names
04:33 - array and you can
04:38 - assign uh an one more member to this
04:42 - array which will be so we have 0 1 2
04:47 - okay so members till uh key two right
04:52 - you can add the third
04:55 - key and you can add this name for
04:58 - example
05:00 - some random name for example and
05:05 - then uh you can print this
05:08 - here right and what this code is doing
05:12 - is it's just adding Julie to this array
05:17 - right I will save this and I will
05:20 - refresh this and you can see our array
05:24 - is now containing Julie also right now
05:28 - for example you want to print all the
05:30 - values of this array you can do it like
05:33 - this you can use uh a function called
05:37 - print uncore R and it can take the array
05:44 - name like
05:46 - this and what it will do is it will
05:49 - print all the values of your array with
05:53 - their index or key so let's try to
05:57 - refresh it and you see
06:00 - it prints that you have passed an array
06:03 - inside your uh inside your print R
06:06 - function and the index of this name Mark
06:11 - is zero or key of this Mark is
06:14 - zero John Key of John is one key of Bob
06:19 - is two and you can see Julie is also
06:23 - added and the key of Julie
06:25 - is uh three you can add more
06:30 - more values to this by just assigning it
06:36 - a new key and new name
06:43 - okay and then you will be able to see
06:47 - one more key here okay so the key of uh
06:52 - Patrick is four right so this is the
06:56 - basics of array uh in PHP but there are
06:59 - different kind of array in PHP for
07:02 - example associative array or
07:05 - multi-dimensional array which I will be
07:07 - talking in the later videos so that's it
07:11 - for this video I hope you have enjoyed

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use array in your PHP code so first of all what is an array array is the collection of similar data so for example you want a collection of names you cannot save all the names in a single variable but whenever you use array you will be able to save multiple values of same data type in a single variable so array is a collection of values basically now let's see how we can declare arrays in PHP uh the Declaration is same for array as the variable you just start with your end symbol and for example I want to make an array of names and then you just give this equal to sign and then tell PHP that it's it's an array by keyword array not here but okay and then in these two brackets you give the values to the array okay so for example uh the names can be Mark and uh bear in mind if this is a string data type because names can by Logic are some string data types so just if it's a string data type just include this with in the single quotes as we have seen in the string variables right and second name can be John and third name can be simple name Bob for example and then how for examp okay first of all so you have provided three values in the array now this these uh values you have provided are called elements of the array okay so this is one Element this is second element and this is third element so this is called element of the array now the position of these uh these values or these elements is also important and the position of these values or elements are called key or index and position this key or index starts from zero okay so always always remember that these element key or index starts from zero one and two this is the position at which they are stored in the array now in order to print this what you just need to do is Echo and you can just use your name with of course this and symbol and you can use these square brackets to represent the position which you want to print so this is the zero position first position and second position because index or key starts from zero so for example I want to print the name John I will just Echo names and with a key one right save it and I will just run this and it shows John in a similar way I can print Mark save it and just refresh it it will be Mark or I can just print Bob also okay I will refresh it and you will be able to see for now you can also assign value to the array it's not necessary that you need to only uh you know give the values at the time of initialization of this uh name array you can uh assign these value at run time also or whatever for for example you want to assign some value to the array you can just uh use this name names array and you can assign uh an one more member to this array which will be so we have 0 1 2 okay so members till uh key two right you can add the third key and you can add this name for example some random name for example and then uh you can print this here right and what this code is doing is it's just adding Julie to this array right I will save this and I will refresh this and you can see our array is now containing Julie also right now for example you want to print all the values of this array you can do it like this you can use uh a function called print uncore R and it can take the array name like this and what it will do is it will print all the values of your array with their index or key so let's try to refresh it and you see it prints that you have passed an array inside your uh inside your print R function and the index of this name Mark is zero or key of this Mark is zero John Key of John is one key of Bob is two and you can see Julie is also added and the key of Julie is uh three you can add more more values to this by just assigning it a new key and new name okay and then you will be able to see one more key here okay so the key of uh Patrick is four right so this is the basics of array uh in PHP but there are different kind of array in PHP for example associative array or multidimensional array which I will be talking in the later videos so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
