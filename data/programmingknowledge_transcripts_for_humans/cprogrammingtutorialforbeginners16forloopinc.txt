00:00 - it was a place welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video this is John from programming
00:06 - knowledge and this is part 16 guys of
00:09 - our video tutorial series for C and in
00:14 - this video guys we're going to discuss
00:15 - another type of loop which is for loop
00:19 - so from the previous tutorials we have
00:22 - like discussed already what is wide loop
00:26 - what is do-while and now it can be used
00:28 - in our c programming or AC programs so
00:32 - as i've said guys in this video we're
00:34 - going to discuss for loops and of course
00:36 - we're going to describe the syntax of
00:37 - for loops okay so the syntax for for
00:42 - loops guys is like this i'm going to
00:46 - copy and paste this year so we have here
00:51 - the four keyword and then we have the
00:55 - open and closed parenthesis in which we
00:58 - have we can you know there there are
01:01 - like three statements that are available
01:05 - for us so the first one is the image or
01:10 - initialize and then the second statement
01:15 - is the condition and the third one is
01:20 - increment or it could be also decrement
01:24 - okay so this three statements inside
01:27 - this open and close parentheses is
01:29 - separated by semicolon right and of
01:33 - course guys each of this statement place
01:38 - you know a big role in our for loop okay
01:42 - now we can try to implement our very
01:44 - simple for loop so for example let's
01:48 - declare a variable for our for loop
01:52 - inside the initialized statement because
01:56 - you know initialize a variable right
01:59 - here like for example int x equals 0 so
02:06 - we could do that here we could
02:08 - initialize our variable into something
02:10 - like 0 or it could be
02:13 - if you want to start one so basically
02:19 - guys it is the same as declaring the
02:22 - variable here so in x0 so you could also
02:26 - do that here initialize the value to X
02:32 - so this 2 is just the same so basically
02:36 - we're just declaring the variable and
02:37 - setting the initial value say for
02:40 - example 0 or 1
02:42 - now the second statement for this
02:46 - particular for loop we could you know
02:50 - add the condition so the condition is
02:54 - something like this we could check if
02:58 - the X variable is less than or equal to
03:04 - 5 just like what we have from the while
03:07 - loop and do-while loops over checking if
03:11 - the value of the variable is less than
03:13 - or equal to 5 and of course the last
03:16 - part or the last statement for this
03:18 - particular open and closed parenthesis
03:20 - for loop you could you know add the
03:23 - increment or it could be the decrement
03:26 - depending on the initialize the
03:29 - condition of course in your for loop so
03:32 - for example we want for now is the
03:34 - increment so you could actually do this
03:36 - like this x equals x plus 1 inside the
03:42 - for loop and then of course guys the
03:45 - statements inside the curly braces so
03:49 - the statements you know you could
03:51 - execute statements right here so for
03:54 - example printf the value of x colon and
04:01 - then the format specifier % be backslash
04:07 - n to have a newline then specify our
04:11 - variable X and then end this off with a
04:16 - semicolon
04:17 - just like this so guys basically what
04:20 - we're trying is to display the value of
04:21 - the variable X each iteration of this
04:25 - part
04:25 - Laure look so we could you know build
04:28 - and run this application and see how it
04:32 - works now we have this output the value
04:35 - is one
04:37 - Diwali is 2 the value is 3 the value is
04:41 - 4 and 5 so guys I'm going to explain to
04:44 - you how we come up with this output so
04:49 - at first guys you know we declare the
04:53 - variable X and initialize the value into
04:57 - 1 so now the value for our X is 1 okay
05:02 - so value of our X is 1 1 okay and then
05:16 - let me write first is equal or X is
05:20 - equal or less than or equal to 5 and
05:23 - then increment okay so so for example
05:31 - the first iteration of this for loop we
05:34 - have initialized the value into 1 or we
05:38 - had a value of x into 1 and then we try
05:42 - to evaluate the statement is X is less
05:45 - than or equal to 5 so of course X is
05:49 - less than 5 since the value of x equals
05:55 - to 5 so this returns true then it will
06:01 - execute the statement the value the
06:07 - value of X it should be X right there is
06:14 - 1 ok and after this after execution of
06:18 - this particular statement it will
06:20 - increment the value of our X so at the
06:23 - second iteration it will be 2 K so of
06:28 - course 2 is less than 5 so that's
06:31 - basically the condition will return true
06:37 - and then of course
06:39 - it will display the value of x is 2 and
06:45 - then another iteration 3 so 3 is less
06:50 - than or equal to 5 right
06:55 - and obviously the 3 is less than 2/5 so
07:02 - basically it will return true and then
07:06 - display this statement and until the X
07:15 - will become 6 ok 6 and then it will
07:21 - evaluate is 6 less than or equal to 5 so
07:28 - basically this is false and then it will
07:33 - terminate the loop or it will end the
07:37 - loop itself so that's how we got this
07:41 - output the value is 1 2 3 4 and 5 so
07:46 - this particular output guys is
07:48 - incremented so the value of our X is
07:50 - increment like 1 2 3 4 & 5 but anyway
07:55 - guys we could you know make it like 5 4
07:57 - 3 2 1 and we will initialize our
08:01 - variable X differently so for example
08:05 - let's try to revise our for loop and we
08:10 - will start from 5 ok so the initial
08:14 - value of our X is equal to 5 and of
08:18 - course we will check if so for example
08:22 - is X is greater than or equal to 1 so
08:27 - now we're doing the reverse of the
08:30 - increment and of course guys you can you
08:34 - know add the increment statement just
08:37 - like this x equals 2x minus 1 and of
08:41 - course you can use the post increment
08:44 - that we have discussed from earlier
08:46 - videos in this particular series so you
08:49 - could do it like this X minus minus
08:53 - and then we could you know display the
08:56 - value of our ex hey so let's try this
09:01 - once again
09:01 - and build and run our application and of
09:05 - course we're going to get the reverse
09:08 - output okay so we have here the initial
09:12 - value five and then four and then three
09:15 - and then two and then one okay so guys
09:21 - of course you can always try to you know
09:24 - add another four look inside this note
09:27 - so as what we have from the previous
09:31 - tutorials we have like the nested if and
09:34 - else statement and of course guys you
09:36 - could all those you could also have
09:38 - nested for-loops or nested while loops
09:41 - in your program so for example like this
09:44 - you could you know add another for loop
09:48 - here so for example in why is we will
09:55 - set the initial value to one okay I'm
10:01 - shall value into one and then we could
10:05 - try to evaluate the statement so for
10:09 - example is y less than or equal to X
10:15 - something like this and then we could
10:18 - add the increment Y plus plus okay and
10:24 - then open occurred open and closed curly
10:26 - braces and then of course you can
10:28 - display the value of our x and y so the
10:33 - value of x for example percent d and
10:38 - value of y is something like this the
10:47 - body of X is percent d and then the
10:50 - value of y is percent B again okay and
10:58 - then we could also specify the value of
11:00 - our Y hey so we could you know get and
11:04 - run our application
11:06 - and of course we will get this
11:08 - particular output so the value of x from
11:14 - [Music]
11:16 - initial value over X is five right so it
11:20 - will try to run five times and then it
11:23 - will try to display one to win one two
11:27 - three four and five for our value of our
11:30 - Y P and then of course we have the four
11:38 - and then it also have three and then you
11:42 - also have one in two and one so you
11:46 - could do that guys as I've said you can
11:48 - do nested for-loops or nested loops in
11:52 - your C program so you could increment
11:57 - you could use decrement inside your
11:59 - loops okay so and this if you want to
12:03 - practice more about using loops you
12:06 - could you know try to create different
12:08 - patterns the first sample you want to
12:09 - paint a rectangle or triangle you could
12:13 - display inverted triangle by using the
12:19 - asterism ball so you could do that by
12:22 - using your loops okay so I think that's
12:25 - all there is to it guys for this
12:26 - tutorial and I hope you learn something
12:29 - and if you have questions as always you
12:32 - can ask questions in the comment box
12:34 - below so thank you for watching guys and
12:36 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

it was a place welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and this is part 16 guys of our video tutorial series for C and in this video guys we're going to discuss another type of loop which is for loop so from the previous tutorials we have like discussed already what is wide loop what is dowhile and now it can be used in our c programming or AC programs so as i've said guys in this video we're going to discuss for loops and of course we're going to describe the syntax of for loops okay so the syntax for for loops guys is like this i'm going to copy and paste this year so we have here the four keyword and then we have the open and closed parenthesis in which we have we can you know there there are like three statements that are available for us so the first one is the image or initialize and then the second statement is the condition and the third one is increment or it could be also decrement okay so this three statements inside this open and close parentheses is separated by semicolon right and of course guys each of this statement place you know a big role in our for loop okay now we can try to implement our very simple for loop so for example let's declare a variable for our for loop inside the initialized statement because you know initialize a variable right here like for example int x equals 0 so we could do that here we could initialize our variable into something like 0 or it could be if you want to start one so basically guys it is the same as declaring the variable here so in x0 so you could also do that here initialize the value to X so this 2 is just the same so basically we're just declaring the variable and setting the initial value say for example 0 or 1 now the second statement for this particular for loop we could you know add the condition so the condition is something like this we could check if the X variable is less than or equal to 5 just like what we have from the while loop and dowhile loops over checking if the value of the variable is less than or equal to 5 and of course the last part or the last statement for this particular open and closed parenthesis for loop you could you know add the increment or it could be the decrement depending on the initialize the condition of course in your for loop so for example we want for now is the increment so you could actually do this like this x equals x plus 1 inside the for loop and then of course guys the statements inside the curly braces so the statements you know you could execute statements right here so for example printf the value of x colon and then the format specifier % be backslash n to have a newline then specify our variable X and then end this off with a semicolon just like this so guys basically what we're trying is to display the value of the variable X each iteration of this part Laure look so we could you know build and run this application and see how it works now we have this output the value is one Diwali is 2 the value is 3 the value is 4 and 5 so guys I'm going to explain to you how we come up with this output so at first guys you know we declare the variable X and initialize the value into 1 so now the value for our X is 1 okay so value of our X is 1 1 okay and then let me write first is equal or X is equal or less than or equal to 5 and then increment okay so so for example the first iteration of this for loop we have initialized the value into 1 or we had a value of x into 1 and then we try to evaluate the statement is X is less than or equal to 5 so of course X is less than 5 since the value of x equals to 5 so this returns true then it will execute the statement the value the value of X it should be X right there is 1 ok and after this after execution of this particular statement it will increment the value of our X so at the second iteration it will be 2 K so of course 2 is less than 5 so that's basically the condition will return true and then of course it will display the value of x is 2 and then another iteration 3 so 3 is less than or equal to 5 right and obviously the 3 is less than 2/5 so basically it will return true and then display this statement and until the X will become 6 ok 6 and then it will evaluate is 6 less than or equal to 5 so basically this is false and then it will terminate the loop or it will end the loop itself so that's how we got this output the value is 1 2 3 4 and 5 so this particular output guys is incremented so the value of our X is increment like 1 2 3 4 & 5 but anyway guys we could you know make it like 5 4 3 2 1 and we will initialize our variable X differently so for example let's try to revise our for loop and we will start from 5 ok so the initial value of our X is equal to 5 and of course we will check if so for example is X is greater than or equal to 1 so now we're doing the reverse of the increment and of course guys you can you know add the increment statement just like this x equals 2x minus 1 and of course you can use the post increment that we have discussed from earlier videos in this particular series so you could do it like this X minus minus and then we could you know display the value of our ex hey so let's try this once again and build and run our application and of course we're going to get the reverse output okay so we have here the initial value five and then four and then three and then two and then one okay so guys of course you can always try to you know add another four look inside this note so as what we have from the previous tutorials we have like the nested if and else statement and of course guys you could all those you could also have nested forloops or nested while loops in your program so for example like this you could you know add another for loop here so for example in why is we will set the initial value to one okay I'm shall value into one and then we could try to evaluate the statement so for example is y less than or equal to X something like this and then we could add the increment Y plus plus okay and then open occurred open and closed curly braces and then of course you can display the value of our x and y so the value of x for example percent d and value of y is something like this the body of X is percent d and then the value of y is percent B again okay and then we could also specify the value of our Y hey so we could you know get and run our application and of course we will get this particular output so the value of x from initial value over X is five right so it will try to run five times and then it will try to display one to win one two three four and five for our value of our Y P and then of course we have the four and then it also have three and then you also have one in two and one so you could do that guys as I've said you can do nested forloops or nested loops in your C program so you could increment you could use decrement inside your loops okay so and this if you want to practice more about using loops you could you know try to create different patterns the first sample you want to paint a rectangle or triangle you could display inverted triangle by using the asterism ball so you could do that by using your loops okay so I think that's all there is to it guys for this tutorial and I hope you learn something and if you have questions as always
