00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in our previous video we
00:05 - talked about how to create table in
00:07 - MySQL in this video we will see how to
00:10 - insert data into those tables so if you
00:16 - remember we have created a database
00:18 - called data test in which we have
00:21 - created one table called student so now
00:24 - let's insert some records in this table
00:27 - so to insert record in the table you
00:32 - just need to click you just need to
00:35 - right-click on the table and you can see
00:38 - send to SQL editor here you can see
00:42 - insert statement just click on that so
00:46 - here you can see the query that we gonna
00:50 - run to insert the data into our table
00:54 - the query is insert into then the
00:59 - database that you are currently in dot
01:02 - the table that you are using and here is
01:05 - the column that we have defined in our
01:08 - stone table roll number name surname and
01:13 - then comes values and in this space we
01:19 - can provide the values so just erase
01:22 - this now we want to insert a one record
01:33 - okay
01:34 - so first thing is roll number let's
01:38 - insert 10 then separate is value by
01:41 - comma name and then surname
01:56 - now execute this now we want to say
02:02 - whether this Accord is inserted into a
02:04 - weapon or not for that just go to your
02:07 - table and you can see the second just
02:12 - click on that this is the query there
02:16 - turns on the bedroom select star from
02:18 - data s dot strength we talked about this
02:23 - select query in our next video so just
02:26 - leave that for right now and here you
02:29 - can see the record that we have inserted
02:32 - in our table is successfully inserted
02:34 - roll number name in server now there are
02:40 - some variation of insert query just see
02:44 - that now consider a scenario where you
02:49 - don't need to insert the data for all
02:53 - the columns instead of that you want to
02:55 - insert data for a specific column then
02:59 - if I want to insert only roll number and
03:03 - name and I don't want sign it so you can
03:08 - just delete discernment from here and we
03:14 - insert another record say two and now
03:28 - this says that we want to insert only a
03:31 - row number in him just executed and let
03:40 - us see here roll number name and we
03:51 - didn't specify the Senate so it will
03:55 - define now here you now let's say
04:02 - a case where we don't need to insert
04:06 - roll number okay and see what happens we
04:14 - only want to insert the name okay say
04:27 - Mike here it gives an error if you
04:36 - remember in our last video when we
04:39 - created this torrent table we specified
04:42 - roll number as our primary key and at
04:45 - that time I told you that primary key
04:48 - cannot be null if primary key is null
04:51 - then we cannot distinguish between the
04:54 - records which have the same value so
04:57 - primary key must be there if we define
05:00 - one column as a primary key so and there
05:05 - is also one case if we want to insert
05:08 - the record for all the columns that are
05:11 - present in the table then you don't need
05:14 - to specify the columns name you just
05:18 - specify the values let's say pin
05:42 - okay using it here you can see now if we
05:57 - want to insert multiple records at the
05:59 - same time then also you can do this you
06:03 - just need to separate each data set by a
06:07 - comma like 15 really stock
06:22 - this is our one data set then insert the
06:27 - second death arrest
06:53 - here you can see we insert the two data
06:57 - set and just executed and see the result
07:05 - here you can see two record are inserted
07:09 - so this is how you can insert into table
07:14 - single record and multiple records in
07:19 - our next video we will see how to
07:21 - retrieve the data from this table via
07:23 - select way thanks for watching it
