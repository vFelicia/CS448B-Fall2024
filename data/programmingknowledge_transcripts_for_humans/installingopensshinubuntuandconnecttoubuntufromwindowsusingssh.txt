00:03 - how to install open SSS server on OB 2
00:08 - and I will also show you how you can
00:10 - remotely connect to this open SSS server
00:15 - from your Windows operating system so I
00:18 - have this virtual machine and in this
00:20 - virtual machine I have open to installed
00:23 - already and in
00:25 - this uh obuntu operating system here I
00:29 - will just open the terminal and I will
00:33 - uh just give the command to install open
00:37 - SSH server so it's uh pretty simple just
00:42 - write uh this command on your uh

00:54 - enter and it will ask for
00:57 - your permission just say yes or Y and
01:02 - press enter And while in installing I
01:04 - will uh tell you what is the use of this
01:09 - open SSH uh server so when you have this
01:13 - open SSH server you can uh
01:18 - uh access this operating system or this
01:23 - PC which is running on this obuntu uh
01:27 - from a remote location so this SSS
01:30 - server creates a secured shell uh which
01:34 - you can access from the
01:38 - other uh other computer which has SSS
01:42 - client on it so let me show you how you
01:46 - can do it so this SSS server is already
01:49 - installed in my um open to operating
01:52 - system what I will do now is uh I will
01:56 - check my IP address in here
02:00 - of my UB 2 operating system right so for
02:05 - checking the IP address of my open 2
02:08 - operating system I will give the command
02:11 - first I will
02:13 - clear
02:16 - sorry clear the screen and I will give
02:22 - if
02:23 - config so give if config and it will
02:27 - return you your IP address
02:30 - of your open to operating system so you
02:34 - will be able to see this eth0 and you
02:38 - can see this IP address here okay so let
02:43 - me first uh see if I can ping this uh IP
02:48 - address from my Windows command line so
02:51 - because I have this virtual machine so
02:54 - it it is
02:55 - automatically uh connected to my windows
02:59 - so let me show you just go to start here
03:02 - and write CMD and press enter and this
03:07 - opens
03:08 - your command line on Windows and just
03:13 - write here ping and this IP which Ubuntu
03:17 - has so WR
03:24 - one okay so I will ping this uh open
03:30 - operating system from my windows and
03:32 - I'll press enter and you see it's giving
03:36 - me the reply so it's connected to my
03:40 - open to operating system my Windows
03:43 - operating system is connected to my open
03:45 - to operating system now what I will do
03:49 - is there is a very uh useful SSH client
03:55 - uh available on uh the internet which is
03:58 - open source so it's free to download so
04:01 - I will show you how to download it so
04:04 - just go to your browser and write
04:08 - here
04:10 - puty and it will give you some links and
04:15 - you want to go to this
04:18 - www.p.org just click
04:22 - it and you can download this puty from
04:26 - here and installing puty is uh not uh
04:30 - complicated so just some next uh button
04:34 - you need to click and then you can
04:36 - install puty in your Windows operating
04:40 - system so what puty is it is a
04:44 - SSH client or telet client so right now
04:48 - what we have done is we have installed s
04:52 - SSH server on our Ubuntu and then we
04:57 - will install puty on our uh Windows
05:00 - operating system which is a client so
05:04 - from client we will be able to access
05:06 - our server which is obuntu right so just
05:11 - install puty on your Windows operating
05:13 - system just download it from here just
05:15 - click it and install it and after you
05:18 - install it just go to your start and
05:21 - search for
05:25 - puty here and here it is so
05:30 - just open it and when you open it for
05:33 - the first time it looks like this and
05:36 - here what you want to do is just give
05:39 - this IP address here so I will give my
05:43 - UB to IP address which is 172
05:47 - do 16. 80.1 128 and this port will
05:53 - remain the same
05:56 - right and just click open
06:00 - and for the first time when you uh
06:03 - connect to this open to SS server it
06:07 - will show you this warning so
06:11 - uh if you click yes then it will never
06:14 - show this warning again but when you
06:17 - click no it will show you this warning
06:20 - every time when you uh try to connect
06:23 - with SSS server
06:26 - so it's better to uh click no because uh
06:31 - for security reasons uh when you uh
06:34 - configure this on uh uh on a company
06:38 - server or something like that for
06:40 - professional use then you need to
06:43 - understand uh the security settings so
06:46 - just click next or no from here I'm
06:50 - going to click no and now you are
06:53 - connected to this Ubuntu Server through
06:58 - your puty client
06:59 - so just give
07:02 - your uh login name for your Ubuntu
07:06 - operating system here my login name for
07:09 - my UB to operating system
07:12 - is like this so I will
07:16 - write yuntu one which is my login name
07:20 - and I will press
07:24 - enter and I will give my password for
07:27 - the open 2 right so I will write
07:31 - my
07:35 - password and I'm connected to
07:38 - my
07:40 - Ubuntu operating system from my Windows
07:43 - operating system so like this I can
07:47 - access all the file system and I can
07:51 - transfer file from my Windows to obuntu
07:54 - uh operating system just with this uh
07:58 - SSH client so for example you you will
08:03 - be able to see this this is same open to
08:07 - one atate Ubuntu and here also you can
08:10 - see the same command so whatever you can
08:13 - do here on the command line in Ubuntu
08:16 - operating system you will be able to
08:18 - perform it all the same command here
08:21 - also so you can uh access remotely your
08:26 - obuntu
08:27 - server from your window
