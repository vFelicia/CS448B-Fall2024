With timestamps:

00:00 - let me show you the histogram so
00:05 - somewhat istagram
00:06 - so it is a graphical representation of
00:09 - theta using bars of different heights
00:11 - and histogram groups numbers input
00:15 - ranges you can also call it as intervals
00:18 - or beans and the height of each bar
00:21 - depicts the frequency of each range or
00:23 - bin so the height of each bar will tell
00:28 - you the frequency that is the number of
00:30 - time or the pound of that particular
00:33 - column so when to use histograms so it
00:36 - is used to represent a frequency
00:38 - distribution of numerical variables so
00:40 - when you have a lot of numerical
00:41 - variables this is very handy such as
00:44 - price then we have weight of the third
00:48 - edge of the car etc and that time you
00:50 - can use histograms now let me show you
00:54 - the how we draw the histogram so for
00:57 - that we call the matplotlib so this is
00:59 - an alias for Matt kata library so PID
01:02 - dot hist function inside that we have to
01:05 - give the x axis which you want to use so
01:07 - I'll give the kilometer or x-axis and
01:11 - these are the default arguments so this
01:14 - graph will be created so let's see how
01:16 - it is done let me add a new cell here
01:25 - [Applause]
01:30 - so we'll directly call the plot function
01:32 - where the dot ished
01:35 - inside that will pass the data frame and
01:43 - follow this you want appear so the
01:55 - original ROM is created but you can't
01:57 - find out which particular range contains
01:59 - which particular value you can say that
02:02 - it is there are more than 300 cards but
02:04 - we can't find exactly in which it is
02:06 - therefore lie so for that what we have
02:11 - to do is in our haste function after
02:14 - this put a comma and add let's say color
02:20 - we want to change to green and then
02:27 - there is something called edge color
02:29 - so what edge color does is it will do a
02:32 - nice outline to the beans or the path so
02:38 - we'll give the outline in white color
02:42 - and how many beans you want to create so
02:46 - we want bins of let's say five five here
02:53 - on this you can see we get five bins and
02:59 - it was earlier a mess so if you show if
03:05 - I show you the earlier one we can see
03:07 - there one two three four five six seven
03:09 - eight nine ten
03:11 - there were ten beans so by adding this
03:17 - we created five bids and we added some
03:19 - edge color so you can see that more than
03:22 - 500 cars have actually run for these
03:26 - many kilometers from 550 thousand two
03:29 - were like kilometers we are not added
03:32 - some
03:33 - title etc necessary to make it more
03:36 - readable system of flow meter free one
03:51 - hour X label and while differ in X label
04:01 - we have kilometer we have frequency and
04:17 - we don't need to show function so I can
04:20 - see the kilometer we can see free two
04:22 - thousand two one let flow meters we have
04:24 - more than 500 cars that are drawn and
04:30 - very few cards have drawn maximum of two
04:33 - left to left
04:34 - 50,000 kilometers now let me show you
04:41 - the path lot okay so what is power plot
04:55 - so we had seen the histogram was having
05:01 - numerical variables it was used for
05:03 - numerical variables and it was in a
05:05 - continuous form but bar plot is used for
05:08 - categorical variables so we can have
05:11 - some distance between the two bars so
05:14 - for that we have bar plot so it is a
05:17 - plot that presents categorical data with
05:19 - rectangular bars it lends proportional
05:21 - to the counts that they represent and
05:24 - when to use the bar plot so to represent
05:27 - the frequency distribution of
05:29 - categorical variables so as contrast to
05:33 - the histogram so which is using the
05:36 - variable variables we use categorical
05:38 - variables for bar plot and a bar diagram
05:41 - makes it easy to compare sets of data
05:42 - between the
05:44 - run groups let me show you the bar plot
05:46 - how it is done so you can see we can
05:49 - create we can get the count of how many
05:53 - numbers are all number of cars are there
05:55 - or particular fuel type and we have fear
05:58 - death that is petrol diesel in change
06:01 - then we use index forget the range of
06:04 - the fuel type so we have three so we are
06:07 - getting length function and we are
06:09 - passing the fuel type and it will
06:10 - circulate it is at three and that will
06:13 - pass in the bar function for getting the
06:17 - exact bars so index for passing for
06:20 - x-axis so it will create three bars and
06:24 - counts counts is for the height of the
06:26 - bus that is the frequency and the color
06:28 - we are passing red blue and see on the
06:30 - IQ in Title X label wire labeled show
06:33 - function let me show you how to create a
06:36 - PowerPoint so we can get counts so four
06:41 - counts what I can do I will call the
06:46 - data frame so we have seen in the
06:52 - furnace tutorial how to get the values
06:55 - count so we want field type column we
07:02 - call value count function and if you
07:06 - print this you can see lines state 1 1 6
07:12 - and 12 we got okay now what we can do
07:26 - that is equal to you call vampire
07:31 - function come by library and we call
07:34 - unique function and what we can pass in
07:38 - the inside it is the data frame and type
07:46 - of column so we want to target
07:51 - you cleaned the fuel type you can get
07:57 - the CNG there's a lot Piper now you
08:03 - can't a index so next we can get from
08:07 - numpy library showing that we have a
08:10 - range function so it will tell to it how
08:13 - many values out there in particular
08:15 - column so we had a few a tab here it's
08:19 - going to pass the real time so it has
08:23 - calculated now we taught the bar plot so
08:26 - you start with the PID tour power
08:28 - function inside that we pass the index
08:31 - that is how many columns or how many
08:33 - bars want to create and then the counts
08:36 - that is the frequency distribution and
08:38 - the color will pass at least we already
08:44 - know there are three bar so we'll eq3
08:50 - Red Queen and C on and then EQ tighter
09:00 - my Clark
09:04 - here types now we'll give our X Lippmann
09:09 - and X table will be fairy types and then
09:17 - we qry label so wine able to be the
09:21 - frequency and that is enough you can see
09:32 - we got lot of your types title and you
09:37 - can see near 1000 we have fair types of
09:42 - red color green Korea and we can't see
09:45 - exactly what is wrong with the fairy
09:47 - types it is giving us minus 0.5 0.0 so
09:52 - let's just fix that so for that what we
09:55 - can do is we have to add something
09:59 - called ins X things have already shown
10:02 - in the older histogram and X ticks
10:06 - actually helps us to set these values so
10:12 - in X ticks will pass index please how
10:15 - many bars you want to create
10:17 - then we pass so index we will pass the
10:22 - location for the X tips to show us and
10:27 - next we'll give you time so this is
10:31 - these are the labels we want which we
10:33 - want to show on our path chart or bar
10:37 - plot then the rotation we want to have
10:42 - so we'll give rotation equal to 90
10:44 - degree and if you run this now you can
10:49 - see we've got CNG diesel and petrol for
10:52 - each of these categorical variables one
10:55 - thing I have to show you here is that
10:57 - change is not the fear type which has
11:00 - the highest number of parts it is
11:01 - actually petrol so let's see we're over
11:04 - barplot petrol if you run this in type
11:11 - print
11:13 - count then you can see petrol is the
11:16 - highest here 968 has the petrol fuel
11:19 - type so I think something went wrong
11:22 - here so if you print fuel type we get
11:31 - CNG diesel and petrol that this should
11:33 - be reversed
11:34 - so how we can do that we can do fear
11:40 - type so this is an umpire actually numpy
11:43 - array so what we can do is fare type
11:49 - equals 2
11:50 - we'll call fuel type array and then
11:53 - we'll call this glitched and then what
11:57 - we can do is for all the elements by
12:00 - minus 1 so this will reverse the order
12:03 - so if we now check for the spare tire
12:12 - you can see patrol design CNG so this is
12:15 - how we should double shoot and you got
12:17 - any errors or any misrepresentation so
12:20 - now we got correct representation of the
12:23 - data from the Toyota or CSV file so we
12:26 - can get each patrol has the highest
12:28 - number and diesel and change

see the kilometer we can see free two thousand two one let flow meters we have more than 500 cars that are drawn and very few cards have drawn maximum of two left to left 50,000 kilometers now let me
