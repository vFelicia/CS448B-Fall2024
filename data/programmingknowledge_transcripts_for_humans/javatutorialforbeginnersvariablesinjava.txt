00:00 - what we are going to cover in this video
00:02 - is Java variables what are variables in
00:05 - Java so okay so let's just get started
00:08 - a variable is a container which holds
00:11 - the value while the Java programs is
00:14 - executed okay a variable is assigned
00:17 - with a data type and the variable name
00:19 - is the memory location okay so what it
00:22 - mean you can see here there is a
00:25 - pictorial representation of what I said
00:27 - so suppose this is a ram memory and you
00:30 - have created one variable
00:32 - here and you have assign value it value
00:36 - 10 to the to that variable okay so
00:39 - variable is nothing but a container
00:41 - inside your memory
00:43 - which holds a particular value and what
00:46 - kind what kind of value it's gonna hold
00:48 - it depends upon the what type what data
00:51 - type you have given to that variable
00:53 - okay so you can assume it like a
00:55 - reserved area inside your memory
00:59 - okay uh so moving ahead we have types of
01:02 - the variables okay so there are three
01:04 - mainly three types local instance and
01:07 - static
01:08 - so let's see one by one each of them
01:10 - okay so what are local variables a
01:13 - variable declared inside a body of the
01:16 - method is called as local variable and
01:18 - you can use this variable only within
01:21 - that method and other methods inside
01:23 - that class aren't even aware that the
01:26 - variable exist
01:27 - so
01:29 - we will see the implementation part of
01:32 - this local variable instance variable
01:34 - and static variable once we get into the
01:36 - code okay for time being just listen to
01:40 - me and try to understand
01:42 - okay the next the next one is instance
01:44 - variable a variable declared inside the
01:47 - class but outside the body of the method
01:49 - is called as instance variable and it
01:52 - should it should not be declared as
01:53 - static one why so I will also tell you
01:56 - in the coding part of that video
01:58 - okay so moving ahead we have the static
02:01 - variable a variable that is declared as
02:04 - static is called as static variable it
02:06 - cannot be local you can create a single
02:09 - copy of the static variable and share it
02:11 - among all the instances of that class
02:13 - okay and the memory allocation for those
02:16 - static variables happens only once when
02:20 - the class is loaded inside their memory
02:22 - okay so enough talking about the
02:24 - theoretical part let's just get into
02:27 - your IDE and code it out
02:30 - okay and along during coding part
02:33 - implementation I will be discussing some
02:35 - variables rules to declare an variable
02:38 - okay so there are some six to seven
02:41 - rules are here which you need to keep in
02:44 - mind while declaring a variable
02:46 - okay so just open your IDE and create
02:49 - one new project and create one new file
02:53 - here and you can create a new file also
02:55 - by clicking here on SRC just right click
02:58 - here new Java class and let's suppose I
03:02 - am giving
03:03 - variable as my name
03:07 - class name
03:08 - variable okay variable tute
03:13 - and hit enter
03:14 - so it will create a new class as you can
03:17 - see let me increase the font size for
03:20 - you so that you can
03:23 - See Clearly
03:27 - okay I hope it is visible
03:29 - now and let me create one main method
03:34 - so one one added advantage of using this
03:37 - ID is is you can you don't have to write
03:39 - all those codes like here you if you can
03:42 - if you want to write the main method you
03:45 - can just simply type m a i n Main and
03:47 - hit enter on the keyboard and it will
03:50 - automatically write those main method
03:52 - for you and you can start coding okay so
03:57 - first of all let's see what are those
03:59 - three types of variables that I have
04:00 - told you previously that though the
04:03 - static variable local variable and
04:04 - instance variable and what are what are
04:06 - the difference between all this okay
04:09 - so
04:10 - let's suppose if I create one variable
04:13 - here
04:14 - let me create
04:17 - static
04:18 - int
04:20 - m is equals to 100.
04:23 - okay so for time being I know you can't
04:27 - you don't know the static and int
04:30 - keyword so
04:32 - in upcoming videos we will be covering
04:34 - data types there you can understand just
04:36 - for time being understand this is the
04:39 - variable that is M and I have assigned
04:42 - value as 100 to it okay so you can see
04:46 - here I have declared this variable
04:48 - inside the class but outside the main
04:51 - method so this method this this this
04:54 - type of variables are known as
04:57 - static
04:59 - variables
05:02 - okay
05:04 - and you you can comment write comments
05:06 - in the your Java program by giving the
05:10 - two forward slashes and writing the
05:12 - comment inside it
05:14 - okay so again I inside the class but
05:19 - outside the main method I will be
05:21 - declaring one method
05:23 - okay
05:24 - so
05:26 - return type of my method would be void
05:31 - let's suppose I have created this method
05:34 - and inside this method I will be
05:36 - declaring one variable okay so the
05:39 - variable which I declared named n and I
05:43 - have assigned value to it is 90. okay so
05:47 - these kind of variables which are
05:49 - declared inside a method okay so these
05:53 - are local variables means the scope of
05:56 - this variables are only limited to that
06:00 - method means outside this method from
06:04 - line 4 to 6 this variable is not
06:07 - accessible inside your class
06:11 - okay
06:12 - I will comment it out okay
06:14 - and now the last one is instance
06:17 - variable okay
06:19 - so inside I'll come inside the main
06:21 - method and declare another variable name
06:24 - as
06:25 - int data and I will assign value to it
06:28 - is as 50. okay so these
06:33 - variable are called as instance variable
06:37 - so here you can see
06:40 - what is the depth formal definition of
06:42 - the instance variable a variable
06:43 - declares inside a class but outside the
06:46 - body of the method is called an instance
06:48 - variable
06:49 - okay so you may think what is the
06:53 - difference between instance variable and
06:54 - static variables variables because both
06:56 - the variables are declared outside the
06:58 - method body okay so the only difference
07:01 - is
07:02 - for the static variables you just give
07:06 - keyword as static
07:08 - okay ahead of that the variable which
07:12 - where you have declared it okay so
07:15 - I hope you have cleared idea about what
07:19 - are the variables and what is static
07:21 - local and instance variable
07:24 - so
07:25 - I'll be giving you some basic program of
07:29 - addition of the two numbers okay so
07:32 - let's just get started uh wait I will
07:35 - start from here I will just comment out
07:38 - this line
07:39 - and
07:40 - add the comment as
07:43 - addition
07:46 - of
07:48 - two numbers
07:50 - okay
07:52 - so
07:53 - what uh what are the variables you think
07:56 - we required for addition of the two
07:58 - numbers okay so I need one variable
08:01 - which hold the first value and I did
08:03 - another variable which hold the second
08:05 - value and I need the third variable
08:07 - which hold the addition of those two
08:10 - numbers okay
08:11 - so let's create int a is equals to 10
08:15 - and another variable in B is equals to
08:19 - Let's suppose 20 and another variable
08:22 - third variable which will hold the
08:25 - addition value of A and B I will write a
08:28 - plus b here
08:30 - okay and to print something on the
08:33 - console we just write system dot out dot
08:37 - print Ln okay so here in this IDE you
08:41 - have also a shortcut to write this you
08:44 - just route write s out and hit enter the
08:48 - ID will automatically write system dot
08:51 - out dot println for you and I will be
08:53 - printing C here okay
08:57 - so let me just comment out
09:00 - this part of the code that I don't
09:02 - require okay
09:05 - and I will hit
09:07 - run
09:10 - okay so here you can see my file is
09:13 - getting well and here you can see on
09:15 - Console 30 is printed because the
09:17 - addition of the a that is 10 and B that
09:20 - is 20 is 30 and which is get printed on
09:23 - the console here
09:24 - Okay so
09:27 - uh another another example
09:30 - let's suppose we have you have to
09:32 - subtract those two numbers so simply
09:34 - here you can come here and give B minus
09:39 - a or something a minus B whatever you
09:42 - want and you just click here
09:45 - the code will get executed and here you
09:48 - can see then we sprinted on the console
09:49 - because 20 minus 10 is 10. so this is
09:53 - the basic uh very uh basic Theory and
09:56 - practical implementations of the
09:58 - variables in Java I hope you guys have
10:01 - understood the what are the variables or
10:04 - how it works and how it stores the data
10:07 - okay so in the upcoming video we will be
10:10 - talking about data types
10:13 - in depth okay so thank you guys for
10:16 - watching this video I will see you in
10:17 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

what we are going to cover in this video is Java variables what are variables in Java so okay so let's just get started a variable is a container which holds the value while the Java programs is executed okay a variable is assigned with a data type and the variable name is the memory location okay so what it mean you can see here there is a pictorial representation of what I said so suppose this is a ram memory and you have created one variable here and you have assign value it value 10 to the to that variable okay so variable is nothing but a container inside your memory which holds a particular value and what kind what kind of value it's gonna hold it depends upon the what type what data type you have given to that variable okay so you can assume it like a reserved area inside your memory okay uh so moving ahead we have types of the variables okay so there are three mainly three types local instance and static so let's see one by one each of them okay so what are local variables a variable declared inside a body of the method is called as local variable and you can use this variable only within that method and other methods inside that class aren't even aware that the variable exist so we will see the implementation part of this local variable instance variable and static variable once we get into the code okay for time being just listen to me and try to understand okay the next the next one is instance variable a variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method is called as instance variable and it should it should not be declared as static one why so I will also tell you in the coding part of that video okay so moving ahead we have the static variable a variable that is declared as static is called as static variable it cannot be local you can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of that class okay and the memory allocation for those static variables happens only once when the class is loaded inside their memory okay so enough talking about the theoretical part let's just get into your IDE and code it out okay and along during coding part implementation I will be discussing some variables rules to declare an variable okay so there are some six to seven rules are here which you need to keep in mind while declaring a variable okay so just open your IDE and create one new project and create one new file here and you can create a new file also by clicking here on SRC just right click here new Java class and let's suppose I am giving variable as my name class name variable okay variable tute and hit enter so it will create a new class as you can see let me increase the font size for you so that you can See Clearly okay I hope it is visible now and let me create one main method so one one added advantage of using this ID is is you can you don't have to write all those codes like here you if you can if you want to write the main method you can just simply type m a i n Main and hit enter on the keyboard and it will automatically write those main method for you and you can start coding okay so first of all let's see what are those three types of variables that I have told you previously that though the static variable local variable and instance variable and what are what are the difference between all this okay so let's suppose if I create one variable here let me create static int m is equals to 100. okay so for time being I know you can't you don't know the static and int keyword so in upcoming videos we will be covering data types there you can understand just for time being understand this is the variable that is M and I have assigned value as 100 to it okay so you can see here I have declared this variable inside the class but outside the main method so this method this this this type of variables are known as static variables okay and you you can comment write comments in the your Java program by giving the two forward slashes and writing the comment inside it okay so again I inside the class but outside the main method I will be declaring one method okay so return type of my method would be void let's suppose I have created this method and inside this method I will be declaring one variable okay so the variable which I declared named n and I have assigned value to it is 90. okay so these kind of variables which are declared inside a method okay so these are local variables means the scope of this variables are only limited to that method means outside this method from line 4 to 6 this variable is not accessible inside your class okay I will comment it out okay and now the last one is instance variable okay so inside I'll come inside the main method and declare another variable name as int data and I will assign value to it is as 50. okay so these variable are called as instance variable so here you can see what is the depth formal definition of the instance variable a variable declares inside a class but outside the body of the method is called an instance variable okay so you may think what is the difference between instance variable and static variables variables because both the variables are declared outside the method body okay so the only difference is for the static variables you just give keyword as static okay ahead of that the variable which where you have declared it okay so I hope you have cleared idea about what are the variables and what is static local and instance variable so I'll be giving you some basic program of addition of the two numbers okay so let's just get started uh wait I will start from here I will just comment out this line and add the comment as addition of two numbers okay so what uh what are the variables you think we required for addition of the two numbers okay so I need one variable which hold the first value and I did another variable which hold the second value and I need the third variable which hold the addition of those two numbers okay so let's create int a is equals to 10 and another variable in B is equals to Let's suppose 20 and another variable third variable which will hold the addition value of A and B I will write a plus b here okay and to print something on the console we just write system dot out dot print Ln okay so here in this IDE you have also a shortcut to write this you just route write s out and hit enter the ID will automatically write system dot out dot println for you and I will be printing C here okay so let me just comment out this part of the code that I don't require okay and I will hit run okay so here you can see my file is getting well and here you can see on Console 30 is printed because the addition of the a that is 10 and B that is 20 is 30 and which is get printed on the console here Okay so uh another another example let's suppose we have you have to subtract those two numbers so simply here you can come here and give B minus a or something a minus B whatever you want and you just click here the code will get executed and here you can see then we sprinted on the console because 20 minus 10 is 10. so this is the basic uh very uh basic Theory and practical implementations of the variables in Java I hope you guys have understood the what are the variables or how it works and how it stores the data okay so in the upcoming video we will be talking about data types in depth okay so thank you guys for watching this video I will see you in the next video
