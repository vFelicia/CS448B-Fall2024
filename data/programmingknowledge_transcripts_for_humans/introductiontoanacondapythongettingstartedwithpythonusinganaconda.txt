00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - hello everyone in this one we're gonna
00:10 - get all of the software that you need up
00:12 - and running so that you can do not only
00:15 - as intro to Python course but also my
00:17 - other course which is going to be an
00:19 - introduction to the tools that we use in
00:21 - machine learning and artificial
00:22 - intelligence we're going to install two
00:25 - pieces of software in particular that
00:27 - are free we're gonna really just install
00:30 - in one go but we're going to install
00:33 - anaconda and Jupiter notebooks and we're
00:35 - gonna make sure that this is all running
00:37 - on Python 3 so and this will be easy to
00:41 - do no problem there we're gonna spend a
00:43 - little bit of time talking about what
00:44 - anaconda and Jupiter notebooks actually
00:47 - are why they're important and why you
00:50 - want to use them turns out that if you
00:52 - have these skills in your back pocket
00:55 - like you are you know what anaconda
00:57 - Jupiter notebooks are you're gonna find
01:00 - your job hunt if you're doing data
01:01 - science job has to be a lot easier
01:02 - because turns out that a lot of times
01:05 - people do actually include Jupiter
01:10 - notebooks as a skill that is desirable
01:13 - to them and really will tell you exactly
01:16 - what is going on with both of these
01:18 - pieces of software while you want them
01:19 - so I'm going to spend a little bit time
01:21 - explaining why they're valuable why I
01:22 - use them all the time and then I'm going
01:25 - to spend a little bit of time talking
01:27 - about some basic features so we're gonna
01:28 - navigate a jupiter notebook and just
01:30 - kind of get your feet on the ground with
01:32 - what you're actually looking at why it's
01:34 - doing what it's doing and you know all
01:36 - that kind of stuff ok so let's move into
01:40 - our definitions first and foremost
01:43 - Jupiter a Jupiter notebook is an IDE for
01:46 - python what an IDE is it's almost like
01:51 - an interactive shell it's the IDE says
01:54 - for integrated development environment
01:56 - meaning it is almost like a lightweight
01:58 - piece of software that is designed to
02:01 - make it easier for you to code you might
02:05 - be familiar with things such as sublime
02:08 - text which is a text editor that colors
02:10 - your code and all that kind of stuff
02:11 - that is a kind of IDE in some way
02:13 - but IDs have a bunch of other special
02:16 - features and bells and whistles that
02:17 - exist that are not necessarily just like
02:22 - a very simple plain text editor that
02:24 - colors your colors your words it does
02:26 - other things as well so in particular
02:30 - Jupiter notebooks are if you've ever
02:32 - heard of something called ipython this
02:34 - is an older version of an IDE Jupiter is
02:37 - like a version of ipython that they
02:39 - designed to work with your Chrome
02:41 - browser or your Firefox browser Safari
02:43 - or whatever you whatever your default
02:45 - browser is so rather than having you
02:48 - know a application that you download and
02:51 - then you call up and it has like all
02:55 - this weird stuff going on with it it
02:56 - might not be properly updated I'm having
02:59 - like a lot of memory being used just to
03:01 - create a container to visualize this
03:03 - stuff to like put your code in it just
03:06 - hijacks the architecture that already
03:08 - exists in your browser and runs it
03:11 - through that one thing I will mention to
03:13 - you is that once we get to that point
03:14 - once we create our Jupiter notebook even
03:17 - though you're in a browser you're not
03:19 - going to be on the internet at all so
03:22 - you're writing code this isn't on a
03:23 - website somewhere even though it's gonna
03:25 - be in a website browser and I'll spend
03:28 - more time talking about what's going on
03:29 - with that but basically you're just
03:31 - using your internet browser as a way to
03:34 - interact with your code lastly anaconda
03:39 - is a environment manager and package
03:42 - manager for Python and other languages
03:45 - basically when you are building complex
03:48 - code a lot of times you are going to
03:50 - have you're going to use libraries
03:53 - almost like these are modules these are
03:55 - pre-made code from other people to do a
03:58 - lot of your tasks it's very common and
04:01 - depending on how complex the task I'm
04:03 - doing is I'm how I have like dozens of
04:06 - libraries that I'm using and even if I'm
04:08 - only using one library or one module
04:11 - that module might actually call other
04:13 - modules it might need a special function
04:15 - from somewhere else and if you're
04:18 - dealing with all this stuff you if
04:20 - you've ever dealt with this stuff you'll
04:21 - very quickly realize that the concept of
04:24 - dependencies becomes an issue for
04:26 - example
04:27 - if I have a library that I want to use
04:29 - and that library requires that I have
04:32 - another package called numpy it might
04:34 - require that I have numpy from a very
04:37 - specific release like it must be a numpy
04:40 - 3.0 or higher because that's when they
04:42 - introduced some important function that
04:44 - this package is gonna use it is really
04:48 - difficult to keep up with all of the
04:50 - updates and all of the dependency issues
04:53 - that exist when you are building code
04:55 - like this for the stuff that you guys
04:59 - are doing as an intro you probably won't
05:01 - have to worry about this for a while in
05:03 - terms of you know how it impacts you and
05:06 - your learning but it is something that
05:08 - happens a lot and all the time and can
05:10 - potentially happen to you depending on
05:12 - what you're doing and really put you
05:15 - into a roadblock of like okay well now
05:16 - I'm stuck I almost feel like I have to
05:18 - reinstall Python in order to get this to
05:21 - work so in order to avoid those kind of
05:24 - headaches we're going to have this thing
05:26 - called anaconda as our back-end so we're
05:28 - going to download anaconda which comes
05:30 - pre prepackaged with Jupiter notebooks
05:33 - and Python 3 how that all downloaded and
05:36 - so that when we are installing new
05:38 - packages for our next course we're gonna
05:41 - do it all through anaconda and it's
05:43 - going to check the pendency z' and
05:44 - everything and make sure everything is
05:46 - up and running and good for us when we
05:50 - want to use a new package or anything ok
05:54 - guys with that let us move into our
05:56 - syntax section we are going this syntax
05:58 - section is not going to have much in
06:00 - code but it will have we will get to a
06:02 - point where we are now looking at a code
06:04 - like code blocks and like how to deal
06:06 - with a code Edgar so we're gonna be some
06:08 - installation stuff we'll spend a little
06:09 - bit more time maybe try to convince you
06:12 - on why Jupiter notebooks and anaconda
06:14 - are great for data science them and then
06:16 - that's basically work that and off so
06:19 - let's move into that section now ok guys
06:25 - so first things first this is the home
06:28 - page for Jupiter Jupiter notebooks we're
06:31 - not gonna download anything in
06:32 - particular here but you don't even need
06:34 - to install it to have it to try it
06:36 - essentially what is going on here is
06:39 - like you could you could play with
06:40 - jupiter notebook
06:41 - in your actual browser because it's
06:42 - gonna pass through all the code for you
06:44 - but if you install a notebook none of
06:46 - this will ever get onto the onto the
06:47 - Internet what makes super notebooks
06:49 - really nice is it's not only just like a
06:52 - useful way to organize your code when
06:55 - you're coding anyways it's particularly
06:58 - useful for presenting your code and
07:00 - sharing your code with many people if
07:03 - you have a massive code base I wouldn't
07:05 - probably recommend having your Python
07:07 - all be in Jupiter notebooks if you have
07:09 - thousands of thousands of lines of code
07:11 - because that's just gonna get hard to
07:12 - read but you know for like 99% of my
07:17 - daily tasks I'm not a jupiter notebook
07:19 - and that's because it's easy to use it
07:23 - has these nice little cell blocks so I
07:25 - can run blocks of code easily and
07:27 - quickly it will render all of my
07:30 - visualizations in me in the output block
07:32 - of a cell block which is very useful and
07:35 - it's just really really good for sharing
07:39 - but I actually used you for notebooks
07:42 - when I present code bases as well
07:45 - because it's just that simple and
07:48 - intuitive it's one of the more intuitive
07:50 - IDs out there for Python at the moment
07:52 - we're not going to install this notebook
07:54 - we're going to I wanted to show you the
07:57 - website what you can do so it's not it's
07:59 - used by everybody guys and you don't
08:02 - even need to use just Python it's it
08:04 - works with sparc PHP Visual Basic C
08:07 - sharp Python you name it so it's it's
08:09 - standard for a bunch of languages so if
08:11 - you want to use Jupiter for something
08:13 - else
08:13 - you like the way it works for Python it
08:15 - will work for other things for you
08:16 - rather than down on Jupiter notebooks
08:19 - we're going to download anaconda which
08:21 - comes prepackaged with Jupiter notebooks
08:23 - this is free so anaconda is gonna be our
08:26 - package manager I'm gonna see how it's
08:28 - like oh it's great for data scientist so
08:30 - it already says it right off the bat and
08:32 - we're really just we're not gonna
08:33 - download the enterprise we're really
08:35 - just gonna download the straight free
08:37 - version and I'll look I'll go through it
08:40 - all with you so remember we want to be
08:42 - downloading the Python 3.7 versions make
08:45 - sure you pick your proper operating
08:48 - system so if you're on Windows use
08:50 - Windows the windows installer or Mac use
08:52 - the back installer
08:54 - respectively I'm on a mat guys I'm going
08:57 - to be doing this entire course on a Mac
08:59 - you don't really need to have there's
09:01 - not going to be really much difference
09:03 - between how you run things on in the
09:05 - jeweler notebook on a Mac versus a
09:07 - Windows machine there might be some very
09:10 - very slight differences with respect to
09:12 - pathing like how you navigate to a file
09:16 - across these two platforms three
09:19 - platforms but I wouldn't otherwise you
09:22 - don't really need to worry too much
09:24 - about it so download your proper
09:28 - installer and once it's installed you
09:31 - should have something like this anaconda
09:32 - navigator available to you so if you run
09:36 - the end a common navigator and pull it
09:37 - up it's gonna have something like this
09:39 - if you have these but if you have this
09:42 - Jupiter notebook button but it doesn't
09:45 - say launch it says install please do
09:47 - install it right now we're not gonna use
09:51 - this navigator too much for building our
09:54 - code or for what we're doing we really
09:57 - just wanted to download this Jupiter
09:59 - notebook and have this environments
10:01 - thing ready to go for us so this is a
10:03 - user interface of the package management
10:06 - system that's going on in our navigator
10:09 - you can have different environments so
10:11 - you could say okay our base environment
10:13 - you don't want all these other other
10:15 - libraries because they're very very
10:16 - large and will impact the speed of stuff
10:20 - so you can build in a different
10:21 - environment that has like subsets of
10:23 - things in it but regardless of all that
10:26 - what we're going to want to do I'm in a
10:29 - different environment right now let's go
10:31 - application space root regardless of all
10:34 - that what we're going we're not going to
10:36 - be using this interface for much anymore
10:38 - we just want I just wanted how to
10:40 - download it so it has anaconda on your
10:43 - terminal and has the jupiter notebook
10:46 - already and it will also install python
10:48 - for you at the same time so it was
10:50 - really to like download everything that
10:51 - you need in one click when we're
10:55 - building code we're going to make a
10:58 - jupiter notebook so in order to create a
11:01 - jupiter notebook we can go away from our
11:02 - anaconda navigator thing here and press
11:04 - launch and it's going to probably yours
11:08 - have this morning associated with it so
11:09 - don't worry but you will notice that
11:11 - like a terminal popped up and that I'm
11:13 - now on this screen here first thing you
11:17 - want to notice is um your your address
11:20 - here
11:21 - yours should say localhost probably
11:24 - eight eight eight slash tree what this
11:26 - is saying is that it's saying you're not
11:28 - on the Internet
11:29 - it's you are on your localhost you're on
11:32 - your thing as being run right now is
11:34 - being run on your machine eighty eight
11:36 - is representing that is like a closed
11:38 - ports this is just for your local
11:41 - machine this is not connecting to anyone
11:43 - else and that it's just a tree of all
11:45 - these files okay so technically at this
11:48 - point we have turned on Jupiter we
11:53 - haven't created a notebook yet though we
11:56 - can do that I'm going to go into my
11:57 - desktop I'm gonna go into this floor
12:00 - here and I'm gonna go all the way down
12:03 - to where I want to create my notebook
12:05 - find the file path and then in order to
12:08 - create the notebook all we need to do is
12:10 - press new you might not have Python to
12:12 - here but like fine Python three and
12:15 - click it and see what happens so this is
12:20 - an empty Jupiter notebook this is what
12:24 - we're going to use in order to run our
12:27 - code and do everything in our next
12:29 - section we're gonna spend a lot more
12:31 - we're gonna spend time actually playing
12:33 - with this interface and showing you
12:34 - what's available to it but wanted to get
12:37 - you to a point where you are a
12:39 - understanding that you're not on the
12:40 - internet even though it feels like
12:41 - you're on the internet and so you can
12:43 - relax that you're not gonna get viruses
12:45 - or anything from this and get you all
12:48 - installed I want to show you a couple
12:51 - more things in a terminal meaning like
12:53 - our command line really quickly before
12:56 - moving into a recap though okay so at
12:58 - the moment guys I'm actually in terminal
13:01 - in on a Macintosh computer basically
13:03 - it's like your command line you if you
13:06 - are on a Windows machine maybe put in
13:09 - something like command prompt yeah that
13:14 - was just a command that you can use in
13:16 - this terminal anyway the point of me
13:19 - bringing up this terminal in the first
13:20 - place is to
13:21 - show you two things one if you've
13:27 - installed anaconda properly if you call
13:30 - Conda it should give you something like
13:33 - this if it says it doesn't know what the
13:34 - hot the key is or whatever is going on
13:37 - it errors basically then make sure that
13:40 - your anaconda has been unloaded and
13:44 - installed properly basically if you are
13:48 - going to install a package that we're
13:49 - going to use in a Jupiter notebook you
13:52 - want to be doing Conda install and
13:54 - basically find where the pack if you go
13:56 - on if you google like Conda install the
13:59 - package it will give you the command
14:01 - there like the path that you need in
14:03 - order to find where the installation
14:04 - package is located Co going Conda
14:06 - install this package destination in
14:10 - anaconda will do everything for you the
14:12 - other thing you can do is if you don't
14:14 - want to load that obnoxiously head like
14:16 - big anaconda navigator and it can never
14:21 - get a program if you just want to create
14:23 - a Jupiter notebook navigate to where you
14:26 - want to be in your terminal so I'm not
14:30 - going to do a class on bash and like all
14:32 - the commands that are going on here but
14:34 - if you've never encountered a terminal
14:35 - before in Python or in Mac this is what
14:38 - it looks like I'm saying change
14:39 - directory I right now I'm in a home
14:40 - directory so I want to go to that
14:42 - directory where I'm you know I have my
14:45 - kick we have this all my class files
14:47 - associated with it so I'm going all the
14:50 - way into here I'm listing the files that
14:53 - are available here okay change directory
14:55 - into code and now if I want to create my
14:58 - two Paterno book in this folder I just
15:00 - go Joop your notebook it's going to
15:02 - populate a bunch of silly stuff here
15:05 - that is like probably don't need to
15:07 - worry too much about but this is gonna
15:08 - stay running so you want to leave this
15:10 - terminal open and you'll notice here
15:13 - that it just populated a new notebook
15:16 - and it's all running here so just a
15:19 - handful of explanations of like a ways
15:23 - of installing Python why we're using
15:28 - Jupiter notebooks why we're using
15:30 - anaconda and ways to like navigate
15:33 - through without dealing with the
15:34 - large game using anaconda and Jupiter
15:38 - notebooks at the command line to just at
15:40 - least like load them up if you don't
15:41 - want to be use that a really large app
15:43 - so with that guys let's do a recap okay
15:50 - everyone in this class we installed our
15:53 - Jupiter and anaconda software I
15:56 - described why they're useful to you
15:58 - showed you a little bit of their front
15:59 - page and gave you a handful of tips and
16:02 - tricks to deal with you know creating
16:05 - new notebooks and installing and
16:07 - anaconda
16:09 - hopefully you see why it's useful from
16:12 - my explanation and from some
16:13 - demonstration and I I guarantee you
16:17 - you'll be using Jupiter notebooks
16:19 - if you continue a career in data science
16:21 - you will probably use a Jupiter notebook
16:22 - sooner rather than later so I'm happy
16:24 - you at least know what it is have it
16:26 - installed so with that guys thank you
16:29 - very much
16:33 - [Music]
16:40 - Oh
16:49 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone in this one we're gonna get all of the software that you need up and running so that you can do not only as intro to Python course but also my other course which is going to be an introduction to the tools that we use in machine learning and artificial intelligence we're going to install two pieces of software in particular that are free we're gonna really just install in one go but we're going to install anaconda and Jupiter notebooks and we're gonna make sure that this is all running on Python 3 so and this will be easy to do no problem there we're gonna spend a little bit of time talking about what anaconda and Jupiter notebooks actually are why they're important and why you want to use them turns out that if you have these skills in your back pocket like you are you know what anaconda Jupiter notebooks are you're gonna find your job hunt if you're doing data science job has to be a lot easier because turns out that a lot of times people do actually include Jupiter notebooks as a skill that is desirable to them and really will tell you exactly what is going on with both of these pieces of software while you want them so I'm going to spend a little bit time explaining why they're valuable why I use them all the time and then I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about some basic features so we're gonna navigate a jupiter notebook and just kind of get your feet on the ground with what you're actually looking at why it's doing what it's doing and you know all that kind of stuff ok so let's move into our definitions first and foremost Jupiter a Jupiter notebook is an IDE for python what an IDE is it's almost like an interactive shell it's the IDE says for integrated development environment meaning it is almost like a lightweight

then you call up and it has like all this weird stuff going on with it it might not be properly updated I'm having like a lot of memory being used just to create a container to visualize this stuff to like put your code in it just hijacks the architecture that already exists in your browser and runs it through that one thing I will mention to you is that once we get to that point once we create our Jupiter notebook even though you're in a browser you're not going to be on the internet at all so you're writing code this isn't on a website somewhere even though it's gonna be in a website browser

you probably won't have to worry about this for a while in terms of you know how it impacts you and your learning but it is something that happens a lot and all the time and can potentially happen to

those kind of headaches we're going to have this thing called anaconda as our backend so we're going to download anaconda which comes pre prepackaged with Jupiter notebooks and Python 3 how that all

up and running and good for us when we want to use a new package or anything ok guys with that let us move into our syntax section we are going this syntax section is not going to have much in code but it will have we will get to a point where we are now looking at a code like code blocks and like how to deal with a code Edgar so we're gonna be some installation stuff we'll spend a little bit more time maybe try to convince you on why Jupiter notebooks and anaconda are great for data science them and then that's basically work that and off so let's move into that section now ok guys so first things first this is the home page for Jupiter Jupiter notebooks we're not gonna download anything in particular here but you don't even need to install it to have it to try it essentially what is going on here is like you could you could play with jupiter notebook in your actual browser because it's gonna pass through all the code for you but if you install a notebook none of this will ever get onto the onto the Internet what makes super notebooks really nice is it's not only just like a useful way to organize your code when you're coding anyways it's particularly useful for presenting your code and sharing your code with many people if you have a massive code base I wouldn't probably recommend having your Python all be in Jupiter notebooks if you have thousands of thousands of lines of code because that's just gonna get hard to read but you know for like 99% of my daily tasks I'm not a jupiter notebook and that's because it's easy to use it has these nice little cell blocks so I can run blocks of code easily and quickly it will render all of my visualizations in me in the output block of a cell block which is very useful and it's just really really good for sharing but I actually used you for notebooks when I present code bases as well because it's just that simple and intuitive it's one of the more intuitive IDs out there for Python at the moment we're not going to install this notebook we're going to I wanted to show you the website what you can do so it's not it's used by everybody guys and you don't even need to use just Python it's it works with sparc PHP Visual Basic C sharp Python you name it so it's it's standard for a bunch of languages so if you want to use Jupiter for something else you like the way it works for Python it will work for other things for you rather than down on Jupiter notebooks we're going to download anaconda which comes prepackaged with Jupiter notebooks this is free so anaconda is gonna be our package manager I'm gonna see how it's like oh it's great for data scientist so it already says it right off the bat and we're really just we're not gonna download the enterprise we're really just gonna download the straight free version and I'll look I'll go through it all with you so remember we want to be downloading the Python 3.7 versions make sure you pick your proper operating system so if you're on Windows use Windows the windows installer or Mac use the back installer respectively I'm on a mat guys I'm going to be doing this entire course on a Mac you don't really need to have there's not going to be really much difference between how you run things on in the jeweler notebook on a Mac versus a Windows machine there might be some very very slight differences with respect to pathing like how you navigate to a file across these two platforms three platforms but I wouldn't otherwise you don't really need to worry too much about it so download your proper installer and once it's installed you should have something like this anaconda navigator available to you so if you run the end a common navigator and pull it up it's gonna have something like this if you have these but if you have this Jupiter notebook button but it doesn't say launch it says install please do install it right now we're not gonna use this navigator too much for building our code or for what we're doing we really just wanted to download this Jupiter notebook and have this environments thing ready to go for us so this is a user interface of the package management system that's going on in our navigator you can have different environments so you could say okay our base environment you don't want all these other other libraries because they're very very large and will impact the speed of stuff so you can build in a different environment that has like subsets of things in it but regardless of all that what we're going to want to do I'm in a different environment right now let's go application space root regardless of all that what we're going we're not going to be using this interface for much anymore we just want I just wanted how to download it so it has anaconda on your terminal and has the jupiter notebook already and it will also install python for you at the same time so it was really to like download everything that you need in one click when we're building code we're going to make a jupiter notebook so in order to create a jupiter notebook we can go away from our anaconda navigator thing here and press launch and it's going to probably yours have this morning associated with it so don't worry but you will notice that like a terminal popped up and that I'm now on this screen here first thing you want to notice is um your your address here yours should say localhost probably eight eight eight slash tree what this is saying is that it's saying you're not on the Internet it's you are on your localhost you're on your thing as being run right now is being run on your machine eighty eight is representing that is like a closed ports this is just for your local machine this is not connecting to anyone else and that it's just a tree of all these files okay so technically at this point we have turned on Jupiter we haven't created a notebook yet though we can do that I'm going to go into my desktop I'm gonna go into this floor here and I'm gonna go all the way down to where I want to create my notebook find the file path and then in order to create the notebook all we need to do is press new you might not have Python to here but like fine Python three and click it and see what happens so this is an empty Jupiter notebook this is what we're going to use in order to run our code and do everything in our next section we're gonna spend a lot more we're gonna spend time actually playing with this interface and showing you what's available to it but wanted to get you to a point where you are a understanding that you're not on the internet even though it feels like you're on the internet and so you can relax that you're not gonna get viruses or anything from this and get you all installed I want to show you a couple more things in a terminal meaning like our command line really quickly before moving into a recap though okay so at the moment guys I'm actually in terminal in on a Macintosh computer basically it's like your command line you if you are on a Windows machine maybe put in something like command prompt yeah that was just a command that you can use in this terminal anyway the point of me bringing up this terminal in the first place is to show you two things one if you've installed anaconda properly if you call Conda it should give you something like this if it says it doesn't know what the hot the key is or whatever is going on it errors basically then make sure that your anaconda has been unloaded and installed properly basically if you are going to install a package that we're going to use in a Jupiter notebook you want to be doing Conda install and basically find where the pack if you go on if you google like Conda install the package it will give you the command there like the path that you need in order to find where the installation package is located Co going Conda install this package destination in anaconda will do everything for you the other thing you can do is if you don't want to load that obnoxiously head like big anaconda navigator and it can never get a program if you just want to create a Jupiter notebook navigate to where you want to be in your terminal so I'm not going to do a class on bash and like all the commands that are going on here but if you've never encountered a terminal before in Python or in Mac this is what it looks like I'm saying change directory I right now I'm in a home directory so I want to go to that directory where I'm you know I have my kick we have this all my class files associated with it so I'm going all the way into here I'm listing the files that are available here okay change directory into code and now if I want to create my two Paterno book in this folder I just go Joop your notebook it's going to populate a bunch of silly stuff here that is like probably don't need to worry too much about but this is gonna stay running so you want to leave this terminal open and you'll notice here that it just populated a new notebook and it's all running here so just a handful of explanations of like a ways of installing Python why we're using Jupiter notebooks why we're using anaconda and ways to like navigate through without dealing with the large game using anaconda and Jupiter notebooks at the command line to just at least like load them up if you don't want to be use that a really large app so with that guys let's do a recap okay everyone in this class we installed our Jupiter and anaconda software I described why they're useful to you showed you a little bit of their front page and gave you a handful of tips and tricks to deal with you know creating new notebooks and installing and anaconda hopefully you see why it's useful from my explanation and from some demonstration and I I guarantee you you'll be using Jupiter notebooks if you continue a career in data science you will probably use a Jupiter notebook sooner rather than later so I'm happy you at least know what it is have it installed so with that guys thank you very much Oh you
