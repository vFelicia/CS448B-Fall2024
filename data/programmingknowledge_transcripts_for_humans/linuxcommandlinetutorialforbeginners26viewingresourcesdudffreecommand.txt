00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video I'm going to
00:05 - show you a bunch of commands which you
00:08 - can use to view the free resources and
00:11 - use resources in your Linux operating
00:14 - system so let's get started the first
00:17 - command which I'm going to show you is
00:19 - the DF command and this DF command
00:23 - reports the amount of available disk
00:26 - space being used by your file system
00:29 - okay okay so for example I'm in my home
00:32 - folder right now and here I just give
00:35 - this DF command and the now it gives me
00:39 - uh this uh kind of output right so I can
00:44 - see uh that my root partition have uh
00:49 - this much amount of used memory and this
00:52 - much amount of uh available memory but
00:55 - what are these numbers these numbers uh
00:58 - doesn't have any unit on it and we
01:02 - cannot you know easily understand what
01:05 - amount of uh you know dis space is being
01:09 - used and what amount of this space is
01:12 - available so for make it human readable
01:16 - there is a flag with this command so
01:19 - just write DF once again and there is a
01:22 - flag called H here and this stands for
01:26 - human readable right so when you give
01:30 - this
01:31 - uh-h flag with this DF command and press
01:34 - enter you will be able to see the human
01:37 - readable form of the output so now I can
01:41 - say that 12 GB is used on my system and
01:46 - 5 GB is available and all these are
01:50 - other uh you know uh root systems which
01:54 - I'm not you know bothered about right
01:56 - now right so important is my this one
02:00 - this file uh root file system right so
02:04 - let's see the next command now so I'm
02:06 - going to clear the terminal so the next
02:10 - command I'm going to show you is uh the
02:13 - DU command and this du command is used
02:17 - to estimate and display the disk space
02:20 - used by files okay so for example right
02:23 - now in I'm in my home folder and uh I
02:27 - want to estimate this this space used in
02:31 - uh this uh folder called download so I
02:33 - will just go to the downloads uh folder
02:38 - so just write download CD download and
02:41 - then I can use this command so just
02:43 - write du and then press enter so it's
02:46 - going to uh you know give you all this
02:49 - output and at the last it's going to
02:52 - give you the amount of space used by
02:54 - this folder right now this is also not
02:59 - very human human readable so we can just
03:02 - write du and the flag H for viewing the
03:08 - human readable uh you know form so just
03:11 - give du minus H and then press enter
03:14 - once again and now I can see that uh
03:17 - this folder is using 416 mgab of uh dis
03:22 - space right I can do the same in my home
03:26 - folder but it has lots and lots of files
03:29 - so these files has to be you know it
03:33 - prints these files first and then gives
03:36 - you the memory dis space usage here
03:40 - right so in my home folder there are
03:43 - lots and lots of files and I just want
03:46 - to see this output not all the output
03:50 - related to files so for that I can use
03:53 - du command and then I can use the S
03:57 - command for summary so this s flag is
04:01 - for summary and then I can also use the
04:04 - H for human readable right so du minus
04:08 - sh and then press enter and then it's
04:11 - going to calculate uh the memory and in
04:14 - few seconds you are going to see all the
04:17 - memory used here so you can see my home
04:21 - directory is using 2.5 GB okay and now
04:26 - uh you can see uh these uh you know w
04:29 - ings kind of things and it says
04:31 - permission denied permission denied and
04:34 - permission denied because uh it's
04:36 - possible that I don't have permission to
04:39 - access these files right so I can use
04:42 - with this command du minus sh I can use
04:45 - this command with Pudo okay and then I
04:49 - can give my password and now it's going
04:52 - to give me the direct output without
04:55 - These Warnings okay so this this du
05:00 - command will help you to estimate and
05:02 - display the disk space used by files now
05:05 - the third command which I'm going to
05:07 - show you is the free command okay and
05:11 - this free Command displays the total
05:14 - amount of free and used physical and
05:17 - swap memory in the system as well as the
05:20 - buffer used by the kernel okay so we can
05:25 - uh just use uh free here and then press
05:29 - enter and then it's going to give you uh
05:33 - the used space here and then the free
05:36 - space here and the cach space which is
05:40 - uh used by your kernel right but
05:44 - important in your case is uh this line
05:47 - of code which is uh this one and this
05:51 - one so this much amount of uh you know
05:54 - uh memory is used by your system and
05:59 - this this is uh the amount of memory
06:01 - which is free in your system but this is
06:04 - also not human readable so there are
06:07 - from some Flags which you can use with
06:09 - this free uh command and these flags are
06:12 - for example minus B for bite minus k for
06:16 - kilobyte minus M for Megabyte minus G
06:21 - for gigabyte and minus Tera for terabyte
06:26 - right so minus ter Terra for terabyte so
06:29 - we are going to just see uh the values
06:32 - in megabyte first and then we are going
06:34 - to see the values in gigabytes okay so
06:37 - minus M4 megabyte with this free space
06:41 - and then when you give this command now
06:43 - I can see in a more better way that
06:47 - around 1.1 GB is used and around 8 GB is
06:53 - you know free and for example I can use
06:57 - G flag and now it's gives me uh this um
07:01 - output which is uh one is used and uh
07:07 - zero is uh you know free because uh it's
07:12 - not taking the in consideration the
07:15 - points decimal points right so it's
07:17 - better to use the M command for Megabyte
07:21 - and you can read it easily here okay so
07:27 - these are some of the command which you
07:29 - can use to view the memory usage in your
07:33 - system Let's uh recap these commands
07:37 - once again so I will uh clear the
07:40 - terminal first of all and the First
07:42 - Command was DF Command right and this DF
07:47 - command was used to report the amount of
07:51 - available disk space being used by your
07:54 - file system right and you can use minus
07:57 - H for with it to uh you know view the
08:01 - human and readable form then the next
08:04 - was the DU Command right so this du
08:08 - command will help you to estimate and
08:11 - display the disk space used by the files
08:14 - right and with this you can use uh the S
08:19 - flag also to view the summary right and
08:22 - you can use even the folder name after
08:25 - these flags you can for example you want
08:28 - to know the um dis space used by Etc
08:32 - folder you can even give the folder name
08:36 - here after these flags and then it's
08:39 - going to give you the you know disk
08:41 - space used by Etc folder and for these
08:45 - permission denied you can use this du
08:47 - command with Pudo so these warning will
08:50 - not be shown right then we have seen the
08:53 - free Command and this free Command is
08:56 - going to display the total am amount of
08:59 - free and used physical and swap memory
09:03 - in the system right and then we can use
09:07 - uh some flags with it for example B for
09:10 - BTE and K for kilobyte M for Megabyte G
09:14 - for uh uh gigabyte and Terra for you
09:18 - know terabyte and you can even use uh
09:21 - minus H for human readable form okay so
09:26 - once again I can uh do this and you can
09:29 - see now it gives uh these values in
09:32 - human readable forms and this is 1.1 GB
09:36 - and this is uh 864 megab okay so in this
09:42 - way you can view the memory in your
09:46 - system I hope you have enjoyed the this
09:48 - video please wrate comment subscribe and
09:50 - bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you a bunch of commands which you can use to view the free resources and use resources in your Linux operating system so let's get started the first command which I'm going to show you is the DF command and this DF command reports the amount of available disk space being used by your file system okay okay so for example I'm in my home folder right now and here I just give this DF command and the now it gives me uh this uh kind of output right so I can see uh that my root partition have uh this much amount of used memory and this much amount of uh available memory but what are these numbers these numbers uh doesn't have any unit on it and we cannot you know easily understand what amount of uh you know dis space is being used and what amount of this space is available so for make it human readable there is a flag with this command so just write DF once again and there is a flag called H here and this stands for human readable right so when you give this uhh flag with this DF command and press enter you will be able to see the human readable form of the output so now I can say that 12 GB is used on my system and 5 GB is available and all these are other uh you know uh root systems which I'm not you know bothered about right now right so important is my this one this file uh root file system right so let's see the next command now so I'm going to clear the terminal so the next command I'm going to show you is uh the DU command and this du command is used to estimate and display the disk space used by files okay so for example right now in I'm in my home folder and uh I want to estimate this this space used in uh this uh folder called download so I will just go to the downloads uh folder so just write download CD download and then I can use this command so just write du and then press enter so it's going to uh you know give you all this output and at the last it's going to give you the amount of space used by this folder right now this is also not very human human readable so we can just write du and the flag H for viewing the human readable uh you know form so just give du minus H and then press enter once again and now I can see that uh this folder is using 416 mgab of uh dis space right I can do the same in my home folder but it has lots and lots of files so these files has to be you know it prints these files first and then gives you the memory dis space usage here right so in my home folder there are lots and lots of files and I just want to see this output not all the output related to files so for that I can use du command and then I can use the S command for summary so this s flag is for summary and then I can also use the H for human readable right so du minus sh and then press enter and then it's going to calculate uh the memory and in few seconds you are going to see all the memory used here so you can see my home directory is using 2.5 GB okay and now uh you can see uh these uh you know w ings kind of things and it says permission denied permission denied and permission denied because uh it's possible that I don't have permission to access these files right so I can use with this command du minus sh I can use this command with Pudo okay and then I can give my password and now it's going to give me the direct output without These Warnings okay so this this du command will help you to estimate and display the disk space used by files now the third command which I'm going to show you is the free command okay and this free Command displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system as well as the buffer used by the kernel okay so we can uh just use uh free here and then press enter and then it's going to give you uh the used space here and then the free space here and the cach space which is uh used by your kernel right but important in your case is uh this line of code which is uh this one and this one so this much amount of uh you know uh memory is used by your system and this this is uh the amount of memory which is free in your system but this is also not human readable so there are from some Flags which you can use with this free uh command and these flags are for example minus B for bite minus k for kilobyte minus M for Megabyte minus G for gigabyte and minus Tera for terabyte right so minus ter Terra for terabyte so we are going to just see uh the values in megabyte first and then we are going to see the values in gigabytes okay so minus M4 megabyte with this free space and then when you give this command now I can see in a more better way that around 1.1 GB is used and around 8 GB is you know free and for example I can use G flag and now it's gives me uh this um output which is uh one is used and uh zero is uh you know free because uh it's not taking the in consideration the points decimal points right so it's better to use the M command for Megabyte and you can read it easily here okay so these are some of the command which you can use to view the memory usage in your system Let's uh recap these commands once again so I will uh clear the terminal first of all and the First Command was DF Command right and this DF command was used to report the amount of available disk space being used by your file system right and you can use minus H for with it to uh you know view the human and readable form then the next was the DU Command right so this du command will help you to estimate and display the disk space used by the files right and with this you can use uh the S flag also to view the summary right and you can use even the folder name after these flags you can for example you want to know the um dis space used by Etc folder you can even give the folder name here after these flags and then it's going to give you the you know disk space used by Etc folder and for these permission denied you can use this du command with Pudo so these warning will not be shown right then we have seen the free Command and this free Command is going to display the total am amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system right and then we can use uh some flags with it for example B for BTE and K for kilobyte M for Megabyte G for uh uh gigabyte and Terra for you know terabyte and you can even use uh minus H for human readable form okay so once again I can uh do this and you can see now it gives uh these values in human readable forms and this is 1.1 GB and this is uh 864 megab okay so in this way you can view the memory in your system I hope you have enjoyed the this video please wrate comment subscribe and bye for now
