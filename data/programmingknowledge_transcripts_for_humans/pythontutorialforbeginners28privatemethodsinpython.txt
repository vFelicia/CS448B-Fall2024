00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how to use
00:06 - encapsulation in Python and we have also
00:09 - seen how we can declare private member
00:12 - variables in Python to declare a private
00:16 - member variable we use double underscore
00:19 - in front of your variable name and this
00:23 - variable becomes private but the
00:26 - question is what exactly is a private
00:29 - member variable so a private member
00:32 - variable is private to the class that
00:35 - means you can use this private member
00:38 - variable inside the class
00:40 - but as soon as you use it or access it
00:45 - outside the class it will give you an
00:48 - error so you cannot access a private
00:51 - member variable outside a class and the
00:55 - example we have already seen so here you
00:57 - can see I try to access this private
00:59 - member variable outside the class and
01:02 - when I run the code it says that there
01:05 - is no underscore underscore C attribute
01:10 - for this hollow object why because
01:14 - whenever you create an instance and if
01:17 - the member variable is private this
01:20 - private member variable is invisible to
01:24 - your object so you cannot access the
01:27 - private member variable outside the
01:29 - class but can be used this private
01:32 - member variable inside the class let's
01:35 - see so I'm going to declare one more
01:38 - method here and I'm going to name it as
01:41 - public underscore method and this
01:46 - doesn't take any argument but what we
01:49 - have learned about the methods in a
01:51 - class that even though you don't pass
01:54 - any argument to the method you have to
01:58 - provide at least one argument which is
02:01 - the self argument and what is self self
02:03 - is the current object so let me just
02:06 - print something here quickly for example
02:10 - public here so can
02:14 - use this private member variable inside
02:16 - this method let's see so I'm going to
02:19 - just write self dot underscore
02:23 - underscore C and then I'm going to run
02:27 - this code and let me comment this line
02:29 - because this was giving us an error and
02:32 - instead we can use this public method so
02:38 - I can use an instance of hello which is
02:42 - hello dot public method and let's run
02:46 - the code now and you can see there is no
02:49 - error that means you can use your
02:51 - private member variables inside the
02:54 - class or any method of the class now the
02:57 - other question is what is a public
02:59 - member variable like a here so a is a
03:04 - public member variable because it
03:06 - doesn't contain any underscore
03:08 - underscore in front of it and that means
03:11 - you can use this public member variable
03:13 - inside the class as well as outside the
03:17 - class so if I want to use this public
03:20 - member variable inside the class also I
03:23 - can just use self dot a and then run the
03:28 - code and it's totally fine it doesn't
03:30 - give us any error let's print the value
03:33 - of for those two member variables and
03:36 - once again run the code and it will
03:38 - print the value of a and C and then this
03:41 - message which we are printing here which
03:43 - is public here now the next question is
03:46 - how we can define a private method in
03:49 - the class so let's see how we can define
03:52 - a private method you already know most
03:56 - probably which is by using double
03:58 - underscore in front of your method name
04:01 - so for example underscore underscore
04:04 - private underscore method and then I'm
04:10 - going to just print something inside
04:13 - this method let's say private so this is
04:16 - a private method and how you can define
04:19 - a private method using these double
04:21 - underscore in front of the name of your
04:24 - private method and the restriction will
04:26 - be the
04:27 - on the private methods also so let's try
04:29 - to access this private method outside
04:32 - the class so I have this hello instance
04:34 - and when I press dot here you will see
04:37 - there is no suggestion for this private
04:40 - method because PI Chum already know that
04:43 - this is a private method so it doesn't
04:46 - show this method in the suggestion when
04:49 - you use this object outside the class
04:51 - but let's try the brute force and let's
04:55 - try to use this method outside the class
04:58 - and when I run this code you will see
05:01 - once again you will get an error which
05:04 - says hello object has no attribute
05:07 - underscore underscore private method so
05:10 - private methods also you cannot use
05:13 - outside the class but inside the class
05:16 - absolutely you can use your private
05:18 - methods so how to use your private
05:21 - methods inside that lass so you can use
05:24 - your private method inside the class
05:27 - using once again a self keyword so you
05:31 - write self dot and then your method name
05:35 - for example private method and that's
05:38 - how you can call your private method
05:39 - inside that last using self so any
05:42 - method you want to call inside a class
05:45 - you do it once again using the self
05:49 - keyword as you do with your member
05:52 - variable and once again when I run the
05:54 - code now it prints private using this
05:58 - statement and this statement is executed
06:01 - when we call this private method from
06:04 - here so I hope this video will clarify
06:07 - some more doubts about the private
06:10 - member variables and private methods in
06:12 - Python and I will see you in the next
06:15 - video
