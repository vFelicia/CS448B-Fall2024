00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - mongod DB on your Mac operating system
00:07 - I'm also going to show you how you can
00:09 - start your mongodb server and use it
00:13 - with mongodb client so let's get started
00:16 - and let's see how we can do it so first
00:18 - of all let's try to download the mongodb
00:21 - community server so for that just open
00:23 - your favorite browser and search for
00:24 - mongodb and the first link which will
00:26 - appear here will be from mongod db.com
00:30 - I'm going to click on this link which is
00:31 - going to redirect me to the mongodb web
00:34 - page now here you will be able to see uh
00:37 - this kind of menu we are going to click
00:40 - on the products section and then we are
00:43 - going to choose this section which says
00:46 - Community addition so let's click on the
00:48 - Community Edition option and now on this
00:51 - page you will see mongod DB Community
00:53 - server download and when you scroll down
00:56 - a little you will be able to see the
00:59 - select package option under the
01:02 - Community server option so we going to
01:05 - just select this option so just click on
01:08 - select package option which is going to
01:11 - open the version platform and the
01:15 - package type right so the version at the
01:18 - time of making this video is 7.0.4 which
01:21 - is the latest version now for Mac OS you
01:26 - have two different versions one is the
01:30 - Mac OS ARM version and other is Mac OS
01:33 - x64 version I have Mac OS M2 processor
01:39 - so I can choose Mac OS arm 64 if you
01:43 - have Intel version you can choose the
01:46 - Mac x64 without arm and the package is
01:50 - tgz package let me click on the download
01:53 - button which is going to start the
01:54 - download of this uh tgz file and once
01:58 - this TG Z file download so I'm going to
02:01 - click on this TG Z file and then it's
02:03 - going to extract this TG Z file into a
02:07 - directory which is mongod DB Mac OS Arc
02:11 - 64 so now what we are going to do is we
02:13 - are going to transfer this mongod DB
02:17 - folder into our home folder of our Mac
02:21 - operating system so for that we need to
02:24 - open the terminal so I'm going to first
02:27 - of all go to the spotlight and then
02:30 - search for terminal here and then click
02:33 - on Terminal which is going to open the
02:34 - terminal so when terminal opens it opens
02:37 - in the home directory and here we want
02:40 - to copy our uh mongodb folder right so
02:46 - when you do PWD you will see the full
02:49 - path of your home folder which is for/
02:52 - users for/ code bind in my case it can
02:55 - be different name in your case just
02:57 - remember this uh path now I'm going to
03:00 - CD into the downloads folder so here is
03:03 - the folder which we have
03:05 - extracted so now we need to move this
03:08 - folder into this folder which is our
03:12 - home directory so just write MV space
03:17 - the name of your mongodb folder which is
03:19 - mongod DB Mac OS AR 64 hyphen 7.0.4 in
03:26 - my case we want to copy this folder to
03:29 - our home folder which is this one right
03:32 - so just type this path here or you can
03:35 - just write for/ user for/ whatever is
03:38 - your username okay once you are done you
03:42 - can press enter so basically we want to
03:45 - move this folder from the downloads
03:48 - folder to our home folder let me just
03:50 - press enter and now I can first of all
03:52 - type CD which is going to redirect us to
03:55 - the home folder once again and then when
03:57 - I do PWD you can see I am in my home
04:00 - folder and here when I do LS hyphen
04:05 - Al I will be able to see the mongod DB
04:08 - folder here also so here is this folder
04:12 - you can see so let me clear the terminal
04:14 - now so here you have your mongod DB
04:17 - folder now in order to run your mongod
04:20 - DB you need to go inside the mongod DB
04:23 - folder so let me go inside the mongod DB
04:25 - folder and here I have this bin folder
04:28 - so let me CD into the bin bin folder and
04:31 - in the bin folder when I do LS I will be
04:34 - able to see few binary files which are
04:38 - mongod D and mongos so first of all we
04:41 - are going to copy this bin path into our
04:45 - zshrc
04:46 - directory because otherwise our terminal
04:51 - is not going to recognize the mongod DB
04:53 - path so when I do CD we are in our home
04:57 - folder once again and if I give mongod D
05:01 - command and then press enter it doesn't
05:03 - recognizes this uh command because we
05:06 - haven't set the path for this binary for
05:09 - mongod DB so what we need to do here is
05:12 - when I do LS space hyphen Al here there
05:17 - will be a zshrc file in your home
05:20 - directory and here we need to set uh the
05:24 - path of if this file is not
05:26 - present you need to create this file
05:28 - using the touch command so just write
05:30 - touch and then do zshrc and it's going
05:34 - to create your uh zshrc file if it
05:39 - already is present then you just need to
05:42 - open this file to open the do zshrc file
05:45 - you can use open command and then write
05:47 - do zshrc and then press enter in my case
05:52 - this file is already present because I
05:54 - have already added some export paths and
05:57 - I need to add the mongod DB path here
06:00 - also so to add the mongod DB path first
06:03 - of all let's open the spotlight so here
06:06 - just type for slash user with capital u
06:11 - so we are going to click on the users
06:13 - folder under folders results so just
06:16 - click on this and then click on uh your
06:19 - username in my case it's code bind and
06:22 - then click on the mongod DB uh folder so
06:25 - in my case uh this is the name of
06:27 - mongodb folder and then click on the bin
06:31 - folder so you need to copy the folder
06:34 - path of this uh directory so to copy the
06:38 - path what you can do you can open uh
06:40 - this bin folder in the finder and then
06:44 - click on view and then click on show
06:47 - path bar and it's going to show this
06:50 - directory in the path bar so right click
06:52 - here and then click on copy bin as path
06:55 - name which is going to copy the path of
06:58 - this Direct tree let's paste this path
07:02 - here and then what you need to
07:05 - do before this just write
07:09 - export space Capital path is equal to
07:14 - and in curly brackets path and then
07:16 - write colon and then your path which is
07:19 - for/ users code bind in my case and then
07:24 - the path to your mongodb bin directory I
07:27 - need to use the small e here instead of
07:30 - capital E so that uh it works fine and
07:34 - once you are done just press command s
07:36 - to save this and then close this uh text
07:40 - edit and once that's done you need to
07:44 - write this command which is Source
07:48 - space.
07:49 - zshrc in your home directory right press
07:53 - enter once that's done let me clear the
07:56 - terminal and then it mongod D command is
07:59 - going to work so just typee
08:02 -  D and then press enter now mongod
08:06 - D command is working right now but in
08:09 - between it's going to uh throw an error
08:13 - and the error will be related to this uh
08:16 - directory which says for SL data/ DB
08:20 - path will not be found so we need to
08:22 - create the data path of uh your data
08:27 - directory so now we are going to create
08:30 - the data directory in our home folder so
08:32 - I'm in my home folder I can do PWD and
08:36 - you can see in I'm in my home folder
08:38 - here I'm going to create a directory so
08:40 - I'm going to just write Pudo and then
08:42 - I'm going to give this mkdir command and
08:45 - then hyphen p and then just write data
08:51 - SL DB okay so press enter which is going
08:54 - to create this data/ DB directory in
08:58 - your or uh home folder I can do LS and I
09:02 - can see this data directory is created
09:05 - and when I go into the data directory CD
09:08 - into Data I can see this DB directory
09:12 - right so once this uh directory is uh
09:16 - created I'm going to just uh clear the
09:19 - terminal and then I just need to run the
09:22 - mongod D command with the data directory
09:25 - path so you need to give this command in
09:28 - order to Run mongod demon or mongod D so
09:32 - just give mongod D and then hyphen
09:35 - hyphen DB path is equal to for/ user
09:39 - for/ your username in my case my
09:42 - username is code bind if you don't know
09:45 - your username then uh you can open uh a
09:48 - new terminal window and then just write
09:52 - PWD and whatever comes after users
09:56 - folder that is your username right so
09:59 - just write mongod dpace hyphen hyphen DB
10:03 - path is equal to/ users for slash your
10:05 - username slash data/ DB this is the path
10:09 - which we have created right now and then
10:11 - press
10:12 - enter and now it gives me the error and
10:16 - the the error says I don't have
10:18 - permission to create the general d right
10:21 - so instead of uh this I need to run this
10:24 - command with the pseudo privileges so
10:27 - instead of uh this just add suda in
10:30 - front of uh your command and when it
10:34 - asks for your password just provide your
10:36 - password and once you do that your
10:38 - mongod def server is finally uh started
10:42 - right all the things I'm going to give
10:45 - you in the description of this video all
10:47 - these commands so you don't forget
10:50 - anything so now our mongod Deon is
10:53 - running but how you can connect to uh
10:56 - your mongod DB server using a client so
11:00 - when you download mongod DB it only
11:03 - comes with the mongod DB server it
11:05 - doesn't come with mongodb shell or
11:08 - mongodb uh Compass which is the
11:10 - graphical user interface utility so
11:12 - let's download them one by one also so
11:16 - once again go to your favorite browser
11:17 - and search for mongodb then click on the
11:19 - mongod db.com result then click on
11:23 - products here and then click on
11:24 - Community
11:27 - Edition here under Tools you will see
11:29 -  shell and DB Compass first
11:32 - of all let's uh download the mongod DB
11:35 - Compass which is a GUI application so
11:37 - I'm going to select this and then when I
11:40 - scroll down I can see the version form
11:43 - will be Mac OS arm 64 M1 for me because
11:47 - I'm using Apple silicon processor if
11:50 - you're using Intel choose the other
11:52 - version and then the package will be DMG
11:55 - click on download which is going to
11:57 - start the download of this DMG G file
11:59 - and once this DMG file is downloaded let
12:01 - me click on this and it's going to start
12:05 - this mongod DB Compass installer so the
12:08 - installation is simple you need to drag
12:11 - and drop this mongodb compass into your
12:14 - applications folder select mongodb
12:16 - Compass press command key and then drag
12:18 - and drop this icon on top of the
12:21 - applications folder which is going to
12:23 - copy this uh mongod DB compass in your
12:26 - applications once that's done go to to
12:29 - your Launchpad and you will see mongod
12:30 - DB Compass here click on
12:33 - it and it's going to start the mongod DB
12:36 - Compass now keep in mind I have this
12:39 - mongod demon running so I haven't
12:41 - cancelled this command so mongod demon
12:43 - is running in my case don't close this
12:46 - terminal otherwise mongod demon will
12:49 - close right so you can see this mongod
12:52 - demon is still running and then in uh
12:57 - the mongod DB compass this is the
12:59 - connection string to connect to your
13:02 - local host mongod DB server instance so
13:06 - just leave it as default and then click
13:08 - on connect which is going to connect to
13:11 - your mongodb server instance and you can
13:14 - see by default you have this admin
13:17 - config and local databases by default
13:20 - present in your mongodb servers so now
13:22 - you are connected to your uh mongodb
13:26 - server successfully using mongodb
13:28 - Compass
13:29 - you can also create a new database click
13:31 - on create database and then name your
13:34 - database for example demo you can also
13:36 - create a collection name for example
13:39 - names and then you can also choose if
13:41 - it's a Time series database I don't want
13:44 - this right now and then click on create
13:46 - database and it's going to create this
13:48 - demo database with this um collection
13:52 - which is called
13:53 - names so everything is working fine now
13:57 - you can also use m sh you can see
14:00 - this option here and it's for sh
14:04 - and you can use this command line tool
14:06 - to interact with your mongodb uh server
14:10 - using the command utility so I'm going
14:13 - to just say show DBS here which is going
14:16 - to show me the list of all the databases
14:19 - so when I press enter it's going to show
14:21 - me the list of all the databases the
14:23 - demo database I have created so you can
14:25 - see it shows me the demo database if I
14:29 - want to uh work with particular database
14:32 - I can use uh use command so use and then
14:36 - use demo I want to use the demo database
14:39 - and then press enter so I'm switched
14:41 - into the demo database then I can just
14:45 - say show
14:47 - Collections and you can see it's autoc
14:50 - complete right so when I press Tab It
14:53 - Auto completes my command and it shows
14:55 - me the collection so you can use this
14:58 -  sh to uh use command line uh
15:03 - client with your mongod DB server if you
15:06 - are a fan of kui just use this one so
15:10 - after installing mongod DB Compass you
15:12 - will not even need the shell
15:14 - utility separately because this sh
15:16 - interface is already there but if you
15:19 - want to install shell separately
15:21 - without compass then you can go to
15:24 - shell under Tools and then download this
15:27 - zip file and then use command to
15:32 - uh interact with your mongod DB
15:34 - servers so that's it for this video this
15:36 - is how you can download and install
15:38 - mongod DB on your Mac operating system I
15:41 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
15:42 - will see you in the next
15:45 - video

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install mongod DB on your Mac operating system I'm also going to show you how you can start your mongodb server and use it with

and the first link which will appear here will be from mongod db.com I'm going to click on this link which is going to redirect me to the mongodb web page now here you will be able to see uh this kind of menu we are going to click on the products section and then we are going to choose this section which says Community addition so let's click on the Community Edition option and now on this page you will see mongod DB Community server download and when you scroll down a little you will be able to see the select package option under the Community server option so we going to just select this option so just click on select package option which is going to open the version platform and the package type right so the version at the time of making this video is 7.0.4 which is the latest version now for Mac OS you have two different versions one is the Mac OS ARM version and other is Mac OS x64 version I have Mac OS M2 processor so I can choose Mac OS arm 64 if you have Intel version you can choose the Mac x64 without arm and the package is tgz package let me click on the download button which is going to start the download of this uh tgz file and once this TG Z file download so I'm going to click on this TG Z file and then it's going to extract this TG Z file into a directory which is mongod DB Mac OS Arc 64 so now what we are going to do is we are going to transfer this mongod DB folder into our home folder of our Mac operating system so for that we need to open the terminal so I'm going to first of all go to the spotlight and then search for terminal here and then click on Terminal which is going to open the terminal so when terminal opens it opens in the home directory and here we want to copy our uh mongodb folder right so when you do PWD you will see the full path of your home folder which is for/ users for/ code bind in my case it can be different name in your case just remember this uh path now I'm going to CD into the downloads folder so here is the folder which we have extracted so now we need to move this folder into this folder which is our home directory so just write MV space the name of your mongodb folder which is mongod DB Mac OS AR 64 hyphen 7.0.4 in my case we want to copy this folder to our home folder which is this one right so just type this path here or you can just write for/ user for/ whatever is your username okay once you are done you can press enter so basically we want to move this folder from the downloads folder to our home folder let me just press enter and now I can first of all type CD which is going to redirect us to the home folder once again and then when I do PWD you can see I am in my home folder and here when I do LS hyphen Al I will be able to see the mongod DB folder here also so here is this folder you can see so let me clear the terminal now so here you have your mongod DB folder now in order to run your mongod DB you need to go inside the mongod DB folder so let me go inside the mongod DB folder and here I have this bin folder so let me CD into the bin bin folder and in the bin folder when I do LS I will be able to see few binary files which are mongod D and mongos so first of all we are going to copy this bin path into our zshrc directory because otherwise our terminal is not going to recognize the mongod DB path so when I do CD we are in our home folder once again and if I give mongod D command and then press enter it doesn't recognizes this uh command because we haven't set the path for this binary for mongod DB so what we need to do here is when I do LS space hyphen Al here there will be a zshrc file in your home directory and here we need to set uh the path of if this file is not present you need to create this file using the touch command so just write touch and then do zshrc and it's going to create your uh zshrc file if it already is present then you just need to open this file to open the do zshrc file you can use open command and then write do zshrc and then press enter in my case this file is already present because I have already added some export paths and I need to add the mongod DB path here also so to add the mongod DB path first of all let's open the spotlight so here just type for slash user with capital u so we are going to click on the users folder under folders results so just click on this and then click on uh your username in my case it's code bind and then click on the mongod DB uh folder so in my case uh this is the name of mongodb folder and then click on the bin folder so you need to copy the folder path of this uh directory so to copy the path what you can do you can open uh this bin folder in the finder and then click on view and then click on show path bar and it's going to show this directory in the path bar

space Capital path is equal to and in curly brackets path and then write colon and then your path which is for/ users code bind in my case and then the path to your mongodb bin directory I need to use the small e here instead of capital E so that uh it works fine and once you are done just press command s to save this and then close this uh text edit and once that's done you need to write this command which is Source space. zshrc in your home directory right press enter once that's done let me clear the terminal and then it mongod D command is going to work so just typee D and then press

directory right so once this uh directory is uh created I'm going to just uh clear the terminal and then I just need to run the mongod D command with the data directory path so you need to give this command in order to Run mongod demon or mongod D so just give mongod D and then hyphen hyphen DB path is equal to for/ user for/ your username in my case my username is code bind if you don't know your username then uh you can open uh a new terminal window and then just write PWD and whatever comes after users folder that is your username right so just write mongod dpace hyphen hyphen DB path is equal to/ users for slash your username slash data/ DB this is the path which we have created right now and then press enter and now it gives me the error and the the error says I don't have
