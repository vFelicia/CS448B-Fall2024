00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:05 - in the last video I've shown you what
00:07 - are arrays in C and how to use arrays in
00:11 - C and I have given an example to you how
00:15 - to declare and use a single dimensional
00:18 - array so I have shown you you can
00:21 - declare an array like this uh and array
00:26 - can contain more than one values of same
00:29 - data dat type in a single variable in a
00:33 - similar way if you want to declare a
00:36 - multi-dimensional array you can do it
00:39 - like this so this is a single
00:41 - dimensional array and if you want to
00:43 - declare a multi-dimensional array you
00:46 - can do it like this for example you want
00:49 - to declare uh 2 cross 3 Cross Four
00:54 - threedimensional array this is the
00:58 - Declaration of threedimensional array or
01:00 - if you want to declare a four
01:02 - dimensional array you can do it like
01:04 - this
01:06 - but most simplest form of
01:08 - multi-dimensional array is a
01:10 - two-dimensional array and this is how
01:14 - you can declare this two-dimensional
01:16 - array right so this is the Declaration
01:20 - of two dimensional array of two cross 3
01:25 - here 2 cross 3 means this array if you
01:29 - can IM imagine uh in the form of uh a
01:33 - square or a table this two is like a a
01:38 - row for your array and three is like a
01:41 - column numbers of your array so let's
01:44 - see how we can initialize this array
01:46 - first so you just give a bracket and the
01:50 - in these two curly braces you can decare
01:54 - your array so first of all we will
01:56 - Define
01:58 - our row Z Z so this will be our row zero
02:04 - and I will move this up and Row one okay
02:09 - so I will just Define two rows first
02:13 - because
02:16 - our array contains two
02:19 - rows if we see this and three columns
02:24 - right so columns are like straight uh
02:28 - lines or columns right so for example 1
02:32 - comma 3 comma 2 are The Columns of row
02:38 - zero and for example 5 comma 6 comma 8
02:46 - are the elements of first uh or second
02:51 - row of index one and it has three
02:55 - columns like five 6 and 7 so this is is
03:00 - a two-dimensional array and it contains
03:03 - two rows and three columns how it
03:06 - contains two uh
03:08 - rows this is the first row so Row
03:13 - one of or index zero right so index of
03:19 - array starts from zero so this is Row
03:22 - one logically
03:24 - but if you see in terms of C this will
03:29 - be row zero right and this will be Row
03:33 - one
03:35 - right because index of the array starts
03:38 - from
03:39 - zero and then these are the column so
03:42 - First Column is for 1 and five and
03:46 - second column contains three and six and
03:49 - third column contains 2 and 8 okay now
03:54 - in order to
03:56 - uh iterate over these values you you can
03:59 - use for Loop but a single for Loop will
04:04 - not work in the case of this two
04:07 - dimensional array you need to use uh two
04:11 - for Loop so Loop inside a loop to
04:13 - iterate all the values in this array so
04:17 - for iterating over these values you can
04:20 - do it like this so you can just write a
04:24 - first for Loop for and then this for
04:28 - Loop will will be for the rows okay so I
04:33 - will declare a variable I or int I is
04:39 - equal
04:39 - [Music]
04:40 - to0 and this will be I will be less than
04:46 - two which is number of rows right these
04:50 - are the number of rows you have
04:54 - okay and
04:57 - then I ++ plus which is our
05:01 - increment operator and inside this for
05:05 - Loop we will declare one more for Loop
05:07 - so inside this curly brazes of this for
05:10 - Loop we will declare one more for Loop
05:12 - for columns so for
05:16 - INT
05:18 - int J is equal
05:21 - to0 and J should be less than the number
05:25 - of rows so number of rows in our case is
05:28 - three right so just writes three here
05:32 - and then J ++ okay so this
05:38 - is Loop inside the loop to iterate the
05:41 - values so first Loop will iterate over
05:44 - the rows and the second Loop will
05:46 - iterate over the columns right now in
05:50 - order to print all the values inside
05:53 - your uh column for Loop this Loop you
05:57 - can just
05:58 - write print F and the name of your array
06:03 - for example this one just inside the
06:07 - brackets just write this and then just
06:12 - write
06:14 - percentage D here and then percentage D
06:20 - here is equal
06:23 - to this should be percentage D and this
06:27 - should be equal to percentage
06:31 - T right so this will be the value of
06:35 - array and we will also print the index
06:38 - of the array right so we have the here
06:41 - it will show the row here it will show
06:45 - the column and here it will show the
06:47 - value right so we have row here so rows
06:53 - are iterated by I so just write I here
06:57 - comma the columns are iterated by J so
07:01 - just write J here and the
07:05 - values can be iterated by your array
07:09 - index so just write the name of your
07:12 - array and then the value of I which is a
07:16 - row indicator and value of J which is
07:21 - your column indicator right now I will
07:25 - just give this next line
07:31 - here so that it will iterate every time
07:34 - in the next line okay now I will compile
07:37 - and run this
07:39 - program and it says the program contains
07:44 - some problem let's see what's the
07:46 - problem
07:49 - here yeah so I think this curly brace is
07:53 - extra here this should two right and
07:57 - these are rows and columns so so just
07:59 - compile it once again and now it runs so
08:03 - you can see it prints the row and index
08:07 - of the array right so at uh 0 0 so at
08:13 - zeroth row and zeroth column we have the
08:16 - value one which is true this is at
08:20 - zeroth row and zeroth column okay at row
08:24 - zero and column 1 we have the value
08:27 - three this is right this is row 0 so row
08:31 - zero is this one and column one so 0er
08:35 - and one so column one is this one value
08:38 - is three that's correct row zero and
08:41 - column two is this one and 0 1 2 so this
08:47 - is the value which is two which is
08:50 - correct here now comes the row one which
08:53 - is this row value or column zero which
08:57 - is this value which is five
08:59 - in the same way it will print all the
09:01 - values of your two-dimensional
09:03 - array so in this way you can iterate
09:06 - over your array using two for Loop so
09:11 - this is a simplest kind of
09:12 - multi-dimensional AR array and it's
09:15 - called two-dimensional
09:18 - array in a similar way if you want to uh
09:21 - declare some other array two-
09:25 - dimensional array with some uh other
09:28 - dimension you can do it like this for
09:30 - example your array must contain
09:33 - three rows you can just do it like this
09:37 - so Row one we have zero and one we have
09:41 - and we will
09:43 - just write the Row third or by index
09:49 - it's
09:50 - row two
09:54 - right and this is row two okay so you
09:58 - can do it like this so I hope you have
10:01 - understood the basic concept of
10:03 - multi-dimensional arrays and I hope you
10:06 - have enjoyed this video please RIT
10:07 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on C programming for beginners in the last video I've shown you what are arrays in C and how to use arrays in C and I have given an example to you how to declare and use a single dimensional array so I have shown you you can declare an array like this uh and array can contain more than one values of same data dat type in a single variable in a similar way if you want to declare a multidimensional array you can do it like this so this is a single dimensional array and if you want to declare a multidimensional array you can do it like this for example you want to declare uh 2 cross 3 Cross Four threedimensional array this is the Declaration of threedimensional array or if you want to declare a four dimensional array you can do it like this but most simplest form of multidimensional array is a twodimensional array and this is how you can declare this twodimensional array right so this is the Declaration of two dimensional array of two cross 3 here 2 cross 3 means this array if you can IM imagine uh in the form of uh a square or a table this two is like a a row for your array and three is like a column numbers of your array so let's see how we can initialize this array first so you just give a bracket and the in these two curly braces you can decare your array so first of all we will Define our row Z Z so this will be our row zero and I will move this up and Row one okay so I will just Define two rows first because our array contains two rows if we see this and three columns right so columns are like straight uh lines or columns right so for example 1 comma 3 comma 2 are The Columns of row zero and for example 5 comma 6 comma 8 are the elements of first uh or second row of index one and it has three columns like five 6 and 7 so this is is a twodimensional array and it contains two rows and three columns how it contains two uh rows this is the first row so Row one of or index zero right so index of array starts from zero so this is Row one logically but if you see in terms of C this will be row zero right and this will be Row one right because index of the array starts from zero and then these are the column so First Column is for 1 and five and second column contains three and six and third column contains 2 and 8 okay now in order to uh iterate over these values you you can use for Loop but a single for Loop will not work in the case of this two dimensional array you need to use uh two for Loop so Loop inside a loop to iterate all the values in this array so for iterating over these values you can do it like this so you can just write a first for Loop for and then this for Loop will will be for the rows okay so I will declare a variable I or int I is equal to0 and this will be I will be less than two which is number of rows right these are the number of rows you have okay and then I ++ plus which is our increment operator and inside this for Loop we will declare one more for Loop so inside this curly brazes of this for Loop we will declare one more for Loop for columns so for INT int J is equal to0 and J should be less than the number of rows so number of rows in our case is three right so just writes three here and then J ++ okay so this is Loop inside the loop to iterate the values so first Loop will iterate over the rows and the second Loop will iterate over the columns right now in order to print all the values inside your uh column for Loop this Loop you can just write print F and the name of your array for example this one just inside the brackets just write this and then just write percentage D here and then percentage D here is equal to this should be percentage D and this should be equal to percentage T right so this will be the value of array and we will also print the index of the array right so we have the here it will show the row here it will show the column and here it will show the value right so we have row here so rows are iterated by I so just write I here comma the columns are iterated by J so just write J here and the values can be iterated by your array index so just write the name of your array and then the value of I which is a row indicator and value of J which is your column indicator right now I will just give this next line here so that it will iterate every time in the next line okay now I will compile and run this program and it says the program contains some problem let's see what's the problem here yeah so I think this curly brace is extra here this should two right and these are rows and columns so so just compile it once again and now it runs so you can see it prints the row and index of the array right so at uh 0 0 so at zeroth row and zeroth column we have the value one which is true this is at zeroth row and zeroth column okay at row zero and column 1 we have the value three this is right this is row 0 so row zero is this one and column one so 0er and one so column one is this one value is three that's correct row zero and column two is this one and 0 1 2 so this is the value which is two which is correct here now comes the row one which is this row value or column zero which is this value which is five in the same way it will print all the values of your twodimensional array so in this way you can iterate over your array using two for Loop so this is a simplest kind of multidimensional AR array and it's called twodimensional array in a similar way if you want to uh declare some other array two dimensional array with some uh other dimension you can do it like this for example your array must contain three rows you can just do it like this so Row one we have zero and one we have and we will just write the Row third or by index it's row two right and this is row two okay so you can do it like this so I hope you have understood the basic concept of multidimensional arrays and I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
