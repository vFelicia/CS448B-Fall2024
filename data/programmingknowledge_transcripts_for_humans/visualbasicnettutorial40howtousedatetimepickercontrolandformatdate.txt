00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use date/time picker
00:04 - with your visual basic windows form
00:06 - application and I'm also going to show
00:09 - you how you can format the string which
00:11 - you get from the date/time picker to
00:13 - your custom string or custom date and
00:16 - time so what I'm going to do is first of
00:19 - all obviously I am going to take a
00:22 - date/time picker so I will drag and drop
00:24 - this date/time picker control from this
00:28 - toolbox plus I am going to take a button
00:32 - and I am going to take our text box okay
00:37 - and I will change its text of this
00:42 - button as format and now I will just
00:49 - change the font size so that you can see
00:53 - them clearly bold and 18 okay now
01:01 - everything is done now just
01:14 - this button and in here I will write
01:19 - text box one dot text is equal to date
01:29 - time picker one which is the name of
01:32 - your date time picker control dot text
01:37 - okay
01:38 - and what this will do is it will
01:40 - literally transfer all the text from
01:45 - this date time picker to the text box
01:47 - let's see what the result is so I have
01:51 - this program when I click this format
01:54 - button it transfers the date and time or
01:59 - only whatever you can see here the day
02:03 - and the date and the month and your here
02:08 - it will transfer it here so it will
02:12 - literally transfer this date here now
02:16 - suppose you want to show that date and
02:20 - time also to your text box using your
02:23 - date/time picker just change this code
02:27 - to date time picker dot value and when
02:32 - you run the program once again and when
02:35 - you click this format it will show you
02:37 - the date and show you that current time
02:42 - right so it will this is the long format
02:47 - of the date time date and time right and
02:51 - sometimes you only want to show the date
02:56 - using your date/time picker so how you
02:58 - can do it just add to this code dot
03:03 - short to short date string okay and now
03:08 - when you run the program and when you
03:10 - click this format button it will only
03:13 - show you the date in the same way you
03:16 - can only show the time by just changing
03:19 - the code to two
03:21 - short time string and run the program
03:25 - and now it will show the time now
03:31 - sometimes you want to custom form it
03:33 - your output from the date/time picker so
03:38 - what you can do is I will just delete
03:42 - this code and I will write format and
03:50 - then in this format I will write the
03:54 - name of my date/time tipica dot value
04:03 - and the second argument I will pass here
04:11 - as a string what I want
04:14 - Oh what format I want this date to be so
04:19 - I will just give double quotes and for
04:22 - the example I want to show the dates in
04:25 - the format like here first and then the
04:30 - month capital m and then the day okay
04:36 - and now when I run the program and when
04:43 - I click this button it will show me the
04:46 - date in the format first the year then
04:50 - the month and then the date right you
04:53 - can also show change this
05:07 - in between whatever character you want
05:10 - to use for example I want to use this -
05:13 - instead of slash and when I run the
05:16 - program and when I click this it will
05:19 - show this slash here or you can use dot
05:23 - also or whatever you please to do okay
05:29 - so now I am using comma instead of - a
05:34 - minus sign and when I run the program it
05:37 - will also show the date in the same
05:41 - format so in this way you can format
05:45 - your output from which you are getting
05:49 - from your date/time picker in the
05:52 - desired format you want so in this way
05:56 - you can use date time picker using your
05:59 - visual basic windows form application I
