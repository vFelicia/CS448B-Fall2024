00:00 - now we look at how to draw two plots in
00:02 - the same window so we draw a box
00:05 - whiskers plot and Easter um let's see
00:09 - how to draw them in the same window so
00:11 - what we do we'll split the windows into
00:14 - two parts for that we have function in
00:16 - matplotlib laboratory so we will call
00:18 - the alias of my project library that is
00:21 - parity dot then we will call the
00:23 - function subplots and inside this
00:26 - function we have to give how many parts
00:29 - you want to how many rows you know to
00:30 - create you want to create the windows in
00:33 - so we'll create two rows so for the two
00:35 - plots then comma next parameter would be
00:38 - specification of grid like height and
00:42 - width etc so we'll use variable called
00:44 - grid specs underscore kW equals to
00:49 - inside curly braces will give our height
00:51 - ratios so this is a string and this will
00:55 - have value in the form of decimal format
00:58 - so if we want to give for the down part
01:01 - more value or more aspect ratio you will
01:04 - give point 85 that is 85% to below plot
01:08 - window and upper plot window will give
01:11 - Oh point 15 so this comes down to
01:13 - hundred you see how to put into a
01:15 - parenthesis like a couple and both of
01:19 - these values will be saved in these two
01:21 - parameters so first parameter is F that
01:24 - is for figure comma the second kappa
01:27 - diameter i have contained into a tuple
01:29 - so that they both share in the same
01:32 - value so one is x is for boxplot that is
01:36 - a X underscore box comma then X is for a
01:39 - storm that is X underscore aged so they
01:43 - will have the same value X file
01:45 - integrates them into the same parameter
01:47 - so now what we can do is we add this
01:49 - lines to create the two plots so for
01:52 - that we will call the sea bond library
01:54 - alias essence not box plot function
01:57 - inside that will give the data frame
02:00 - column you want to include that is price
02:02 - then comma the
02:05 - which won't include so will you ax equal
02:08 - to X under school box so this was same
02:11 - with computed value X Box into this area
02:13 - same way we'll draw for histogram that
02:16 - is by using dist plot function of simple
02:18 - library will give price as first
02:20 - parameter and then we will use ax equal
02:22 - to a X underscore ish then we don't need
02:25 - the kernel density estimate so we'll
02:29 - make it as KD equal to false so now if
02:32 - you see the plot given below you can see
02:35 - there are two plots one is box plot and
02:36 - it is in horizontal format and we have
02:39 - the histogram that is in without the
02:43 - regression line let me show this by
02:44 - running it so we'll first box fix car
02:48 - and mr. Raum
02:53 - in the same window and we'll make this
02:56 - as markdown now we'll use our code so
03:01 - first will you figure so for that we
03:04 - have used
03:04 - yes variable and the second one will be
03:08 - Texas so value axis first parameters
03:12 - Xbox and certain parameter will be X
03:14 - underscore ditched and that will be
03:21 - equals to we'll call what Elias we are
03:25 - two dot subplot function inside that
03:30 - will give two rows we want to create
03:33 - then the grid specification underscore
03:38 - kW equals to open the curly braces
03:44 - inside that will you the height filter
03:49 - score ratios : then we can give a couple
03:55 - in the top I will cue the first one we
03:58 - want point 15 then second one we want
04:00 - point 85 so this comes down two hundred
04:05 - or one now if you run this we'll get to
04:10 - room wise plots in the same window so
04:14 - now what we can do we'll set or both the
04:17 - plots by calling gassiness to see one
04:21 - level ready so first one would be box
04:23 - fourth and we will give cars data
04:27 - slicing operator and v2 price and then
04:33 - make you X is equal to a X underscore
04:37 - box and this is not taken same we will
04:43 - go for s1 s4 istagram so this plot and
04:51 - the Q underscore data the slicing
04:56 - operator and the price column then ax
05:00 - plus core changed
05:04 - here's our exes value then we don't want
05:10 - kernel density estimate so we'll give it
05:12 - is KD equal to false and if we run this
05:16 - now what we can do will include both of
05:19 - them in the same window and if we run
05:32 - this now we got both the plots in the
05:37 - same window so we have box plot here and
05:40 - we can clearly see the price from five
05:45 - thousand to thirty thousand the ten
05:48 - thousand is the median value in less
05:51 - than five thousand it is around three
05:52 - thousand find out something we have
05:54 - minimum value then we have around
05:57 - sixteen seventeen thousand we have
05:59 - maximum value so same way we can see the
06:03 - count of the histogram and we can see
06:06 - the count that is number of cars in the
06:10 - price so
06:13 - we have around 8,000 arrows we have a
06:19 - lot of cars more than 150 so this is how
06:24 - we can have more than two plots in the
06:27 - same window that's just clear this okay
06:34 - so
06:36 - I will show you uses pairwise thoughts
06:38 - so what pairwise plots are used for they
06:41 - are used for plotting pairwise
06:43 - relationship in a dataset
06:44 - what is pairwise relationship I will
06:47 - show you that in this couple of minutes
06:48 - so it will show the relationship between
06:51 - all the different variables in our
06:53 - particular dataset and that would be a
06:55 - pairwise relationship so it creates the
06:58 - scatter plots for joint relationships
07:00 - and histograms for univariate
07:02 - relationship so what is joint it
07:05 - relationship in what is any weighted
07:06 - relationship I will show you in the
07:08 - couple of minutes so this is a code
07:09 - format we have to use we have to use SNS
07:12 - dot you have to use a function called
07:14 - pair plot and inside that we have to
07:17 - view our data frame name so we have
07:19 - cards underscore data and then we have
07:22 - to cue the kind so each kind you want to
07:24 - include scatter will you for scatterplot
07:27 - and then you Q is the parameter on which
07:31 - we want to calculate the pairwise plot
07:33 - so we'll include fury type and now if
07:38 - you I show you the output so this will
07:40 - be output so let's draw them to see will
07:42 - call SNS leverage them pair plot then
07:47 - inside that will give our data frame
07:50 - then the current launching we want being
07:53 - fueled the scatter
07:56 - both of you like scatter plots then you
07:59 - you want to do this pairwise plot by
08:03 - using fewer type and all the rest of the
08:06 - columns so here on this
08:10 - you got a warning okay we've got what it
08:13 - took some time so plot is wrong let me
08:17 - zoom out a little bit okay so one thing
08:21 - I want to show you here is so I hope you
08:24 - can see here we have price then aged 10
08:29 - kilometers these are all the columns and
08:35 - you can see the all new columns price
08:37 - age kilometer so we've considered price
08:39 - first in the x-axis and the price the
08:44 - y-axis so when we have a price and price
08:49 - that is same variable we get a histogram
08:52 - that is univariate distribution because
08:55 - only one y only means only one so only
08:57 - one variable is in what so that is
09:00 - called anywhere a tradition for that we
09:02 - are using histogram and you can see the
09:05 - KD is also put automatically and same
09:09 - way you can see age and the age itself
09:12 - so all the diagonal boxes are h2o rums
09:16 - because they are actually the column
09:18 - distribution of itself so that's why it
09:20 - is a univariate distribution of
09:22 - histogram and the other ones like price
09:25 - versus this one price versus H it is you
09:29 - can say bottom as it is so that is
09:32 - scatter plot because it is not a
09:34 - univariate it is joint relationship of
09:36 - two variables that is price and age so
09:40 - we can see the negative correlation and
09:42 - you can see the red blue and green color
09:45 - so boos are fuel types here you can get
09:49 - see the legend this one is blue actually
09:51 - petrol is orange and CNG is cream so you
09:58 - can see petrol is more here orange color
10:01 - see way we can see the pairwise
10:03 - relationship but for all the different
10:05 - variables so price versus kilometer then
10:09 - you can see price versus HP
10:15 - see we can see for age versus price then
10:19 - you can see age versus kilometer the
10:22 - kilometer versus price like that and you
10:25 - can see the positive correlation here
10:27 - that is between kilometers and 8 so the
10:33 - X is increase increases the kilometer
10:35 - will also increase so this is a positive
10:38 - correlation so you can get more easily
10:42 - the insights are pairwise the
10:44 - relationship between all the variables
10:46 - and some scatter plots are don't have
10:51 - any correlation so that's why they are
10:53 - like this you can see
10:58 - so I'll scatter all over the place
11:03 - they have no correlation particularly
11:06 - that's what they are like this scatter
11:09 - all over the place so this is how you
11:12 - draw a pairwise plot so I have used
11:14 - pairwise plot with respect to fear
11:17 - attack you can also include different
11:19 - variables so the summary so we have
11:22 - learned how to create basic parts is in
11:24 - c-pawn library first one we did was
11:26 - scatter plot and then we did histogram
11:29 - so father we had used dist pod function
11:32 - and for bar plot we had used count plot
11:34 - and in that we had use grouped bar plots
11:37 - then we did a box and whisker plot
11:40 - inside that we did box plot then box and
11:42 - whiskers plot and then grouped box and
11:45 - whiskers plot then in the end we did
11:47 - pairwise faults
11:50 - so guys thank you for watching I was in
11:52 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

now we look at how to draw two plots in the same window so we draw a box whiskers plot and Easter um let's see how to draw them in the same window so what we do we'll split the windows into two parts for that we have function in matplotlib laboratory so we will call the alias of my project library that is parity dot then we will call the function subplots and inside this function we have to give how many parts you want to how many rows you know to create you want to create the windows in so we'll create two rows so for the two plots then comma next parameter would be specification of grid like height and width etc so we'll use variable called grid specs underscore kW equals to inside curly braces will give our height ratios so this is a string and this will have value in the form of decimal format so if we want to give for the down part more value or more aspect ratio you will give point 85 that is 85% to below plot window and upper plot window will give Oh point 15 so this comes down to hundred you see how to put into a parenthesis like a couple and both of these values will be saved in these two parameters so first parameter is F that is for figure comma the second kappa diameter i have contained into a tuple so that they both share in the same value so one is x is for boxplot that is a X underscore box comma then X is for a storm that is X underscore aged so they will have the same value X file integrates them into the same parameter so now what we can do is we add this lines to create the two plots so for that we will call the sea bond library alias essence not box plot function inside that will give the data frame column you want to include that is price then comma the which won't include so will you ax equal to X under school box so this was same with computed value X Box into this area same way we'll draw for histogram that is by using dist plot function of simple library will give price as first parameter and then we will use ax equal to a X underscore ish then we don't need the kernel density estimate so we'll make it as KD equal to false so now if you see the plot given below you can see there are two plots one is box plot and it is in horizontal format and we have the histogram that is in without the regression line let me show this by running it so we'll first box fix car and mr. Raum in the same window and we'll make this as markdown now we'll use our code so first will you figure so for that we have used yes variable and the second one will be Texas so value axis first parameters Xbox and certain parameter will be X underscore ditched and that will be equals to we'll call what Elias we are two dot subplot function inside that will give two rows we want to create then the grid specification underscore kW equals to open the curly braces inside that will you the height filter score ratios then we can give a couple in the top I will cue the first one we want point 15 then second one we want point 85 so this comes down two hundred or one now if you run this we'll get to room wise plots in the same window so now what we can do we'll set or both the plots by calling gassiness to see one level ready so first one would be box fourth and we will give cars data slicing operator and v2 price and then make you X is equal to a X underscore box and this is not taken same we will go for s1 s4 istagram so this plot and the Q underscore data the slicing operator and the price column then ax plus core changed here's our exes value then we don't want kernel density estimate so we'll give it is KD equal to false and if we run this now what we can do will include both of them in the same window and if we run this now we got both the plots in the same window so we have box plot here and we can clearly see the price from five thousand to thirty thousand the ten thousand is the median value in less than five thousand it is around three thousand find out something we have minimum value then we have around sixteen seventeen thousand we have maximum value so same way we can see the count of the histogram and we can see the count that is number of cars in the price so we have around 8,000 arrows we have a lot of cars more than 150 so this is how we can have more than two plots in the same window that's just clear this okay so I will show you uses pairwise thoughts so what pairwise plots are used for they are used for plotting pairwise relationship in a dataset what is pairwise relationship I will show you that in this couple of minutes so it will show the relationship between all the different variables in our particular dataset and that would be a pairwise relationship so it creates the scatter plots for joint relationships and histograms for univariate relationship so what is joint it relationship in what is any weighted relationship I will show you in the couple of minutes so this is a code format we have to use we have to use SNS dot you have to use a function called pair plot and inside that we have to view our data frame name so we have cards underscore data and then we have to cue the kind so each kind you want to

zoom out a little bit okay so one thing I want to show you here is so I hope you can see here we have price then aged 10 kilometers these are all the columns and you can see the all new columns price

and age so we can see the negative correlation and you can see the red blue and green color so boos are fuel types here you can get see the legend this one is blue actually petrol is orange and CNG is cream so you can see petrol is more here orange color see way we can see the pairwise relationship but for all the different variables so price versus kilometer then you can see price versus HP see we can see for age versus price then you can see age versus kilometer the kilometer versus price like that and you can see the positive correlation here that is between kilometers and 8 so the X is increase increases the kilometer will also increase so this is a positive correlation so you can get more easily the insights are pairwise the relationship between all the variables and some scatter
