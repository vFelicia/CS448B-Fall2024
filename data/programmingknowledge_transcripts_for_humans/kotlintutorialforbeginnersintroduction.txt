00:00 - in this series of video we will be uh
00:02 - covering android app development so we
00:05 - will be starting from introduction to
00:06 - android okay so what is android android
00:10 - is a linux based operating system
00:12 - designed primarily for touch screen
00:14 - devices like mobiles and tablet
00:16 - it was launched in 2008 and now is owned
00:19 - by google
00:21 - so the android has evolved so much in
00:24 - these past year now
00:26 - it is coming for various like there is
00:30 - vr os
00:31 - android is coming for watches so it is
00:33 - an operating system just like windows
00:35 - and
00:36 - mac os in and it is based on linux so
00:39 - you have heard about ubuntu
00:41 - it is a linux list operating system so
00:44 - android is like a linux based operating
00:46 - system okay
00:48 - so
00:49 - each year android
00:51 - releases a new version
00:53 - with a higher api level
00:55 - so you might be wondering what is api
00:58 - api is an application programming
01:01 - interface
01:03 - okay so it is a particular set of rules
01:06 - and specifications that program can
01:08 - follow to communicate with each other
01:11 - what basically is api is it is a set of
01:14 - rules for the program okay the end user
01:17 - which is me
01:18 - when i'm using an app
01:20 - so the end user sends a request when i
01:23 - send a request the api execute the
01:25 - instruction then get the data from the
01:27 - server
01:28 - and respond to the user so when i
01:30 - request
01:31 - the api requests when i request
01:34 - send a request the api
01:36 - executes instruction from this data from
01:39 - the server
01:40 - and get the data and respond to the user
01:42 - so that's what api that's what api does
01:45 - so each year
01:46 - android releases a new
01:48 - version with higher api level and as you
01:51 - can see the names of the api
01:53 - each year when it releases it is in
01:56 - alphabetical order and
01:58 - every time
02:00 - it is
02:02 - a thing to it so what is play store play
02:04 - store is a marketplace that has apps
02:07 - that we download and use
02:09 - all these apps available on the play
02:11 - store can run only on an android device
02:14 - okay so just like app store there is a
02:16 - play store
02:18 - where
02:19 - when i developed a android app i will
02:22 - upload it on a play store and various
02:25 - people from
02:26 - different part of country different part
02:28 - of world can download and use it and
02:31 - they can only use it on an android app
02:34 - as it is an apk
02:36 - format
02:38 - okay so what is an android app
02:40 - an android application is a software
02:42 - application designed to run on
02:44 - android platform these are application
02:46 - that we use in our day-to-day life
02:49 - so
02:50 - all these apps like whatsapp facebook
02:52 - instagram these are these are all
02:54 - android apps
02:56 - and
02:57 - any app that you can think of that you
02:59 - use in your
03:00 - mobile on daily basis is an android app
03:05 - so there are three type of android apps
03:07 - native app web app and hybrid app about
03:10 - native app native apps are the
03:13 - type application is a software program
03:15 - that is developed
03:16 - for use on a particular platform of
03:18 - device
03:20 - so as you might understand that
03:22 - like native app when a native app is
03:24 - developed for android it will be used
03:27 - only on android it cannot be used on ios
03:30 - because a native app is built for use on
03:32 - a particular device and its os it has
03:35 - the ability to use device specific
03:37 - hardware and software so as the native
03:40 - app is built only for android app
03:42 - android device
03:43 - it has the ability to
03:46 - use the specific hardware and software
03:48 - of the android device only
03:50 - okay so you cannot mix and match say you
03:54 - use a blackberry app on an android phone
03:56 - or use an ios app on a windows phone
03:58 - that that is not possible
04:01 - so the technology is used to
04:04 - build the native app
04:05 - includes the native apps are coded using
04:07 - a variety of programming knowledge some
04:09 - examples include java kotlin python
04:11 - swift objective c c plus plus and react
04:14 - the pros of native app are because of a
04:17 - singular focus native app have the
04:19 - advantage of being faster and more
04:21 - reliable in terms of performance
04:24 - they are generally more efficient with
04:26 - the device resources
04:28 - than other type of mobile apps native
04:30 - apps utilize the
04:32 - native device user interface
04:34 - giving user a more customized experience
04:38 - so it is as it is designed for a
04:41 - specific operating system it has it
04:44 - gives a faster and better performance
04:45 - similarly as it is developed for a
04:48 - specific operating system it gives a
04:51 - better user interface or customize your
04:54 - user interface okay and we as we as i
04:57 - mentioned we can access the device
04:58 - features such as bluetooth phone book
05:00 - contact camera roll etc
05:02 - the cons are however the problem with
05:05 - native apps lies
05:07 - in the fact that if you start developing
05:09 - them you have to duplicate efforts for
05:11 - each of the different platform
05:13 - like i when i made the app for
05:16 - particularly android then i have to make
05:19 - the app for ios with the different sets
05:21 - of code
05:23 - okay the code you created for one
05:26 - platform cannot be reused on other
05:29 - so
05:30 - this
05:31 - higher ups the cost factor
05:34 - and the effort needed to maintain and
05:36 - update the code base for each version so
05:38 - when i update a app on the play store
05:41 - and when i upload a app on apple store
05:43 - to release it
05:45 - and after one year or two year when i
05:47 - didn't update it with newer version the
05:50 - play store or by default removes that so
05:53 - the effort
05:54 - is much more in native app but the
05:57 - performance is best okay and then every
05:59 - time i need to update the app the user
06:02 - has to download and re-install it okay
06:04 - so
06:05 - it takes a much more space and
06:08 - uh as i mentioned update must be
06:09 - downloaded so um each app that we use
06:12 - today web app uh whatsapp instagram all
06:15 - our native apps
06:17 - now we will go to the web applications a
06:20 - web app or a web application is a
06:21 - application software that runs on web
06:23 - server unlike computer-based software
06:25 - programs they that are run locally on
06:28 - operating system of the device so what
06:31 - it means is like it is a application on
06:33 - the web servers you might have seen the
06:35 - install
06:36 - option on the chrome browser so what it
06:38 - does is it is there is a web page it
06:41 - just installs in your mobile phone so
06:44 - web applications are accessed
06:46 - to the user through a web browser with
06:49 - an active internet connection so the
06:51 - technology used
06:53 - are html5 css javascript ruby and
06:56 - similar programming
06:57 - languages used for web work because it's
07:00 - web-based there is no need to customize
07:02 - the
07:03 - customize the platform customize to a
07:05 - platform or an operating system so this
07:07 - cuts down the developing cost we are
07:09 - going into the pros now uh plus there is
07:11 - nothing to download so they won't take
07:13 - us extra space maintenance is easier so
07:16 - we don't have to push it on play store
07:19 - but
07:20 - the cons but web apps are entirely
07:23 - dependent on the browser used on the
07:25 - device there will be functionalities
07:27 - available within one browser and not
07:29 - available on another possibly giving
07:31 - user varying experience
07:33 - and because there are shell for website
07:36 - they won't completely work offline
07:38 - even if they have an offline mode the
07:40 - device still needs an internet
07:42 - connection to back your data on the
07:43 - device so we need an active internet
07:45 - connection
07:47 - and the
07:48 - apps may not always integrate with the
07:50 - device hardware so these are some
07:52 - problems with the web app another is
07:54 - hybrid app these web apps
07:56 - look and feel like native app
07:59 - they might have home screen icon
08:02 - responsive design past performance even
08:04 - be available offline but they really are
08:07 - web application look native so hybrid
08:10 - apps are essentially the web apps they
08:12 - have put in native app shell
08:15 - once they are downloaded from an app
08:16 - store and installed locally the shell is
08:20 - able to connect to whatever capabilities
08:22 - the mobile platform provides to a
08:24 - browser that's embedded in app so i can
08:27 - say the
08:29 - hybrid apps are essentially web apps put
08:32 - in a native web shell hybrid apps use a
08:35 - mixture of web technology and native
08:36 - apis they are developed using ionic
08:38 - objective c swift html5 etc
08:42 - building a hybrid app is much quicker
08:44 - and more economical than native app as
08:47 - such a hybrid app can be maintained
08:49 - minimum viable product
08:51 - a way to prove the viability of building
08:54 - native apps
08:55 - so these are quicker cheaper to build
08:57 - and they load quickly and they
09:00 - it has less code to maintain the cons
09:02 - include lack of
09:04 - lacks power of native web
09:06 - so it lacks the basicity of native apps
09:10 - and
09:10 - they are slowers
09:12 - and it contain features that might not
09:15 - be useful on some devices so how to
09:18 - choose the one
09:20 - so as we are going to develop a native
09:22 - web what what was the purpose of
09:24 - explaining you all these three types of
09:26 - network all these three types of apps
09:27 - the purpose was we have to choose a type
09:30 - of app which we have to build so uh if
09:34 - we have if we would have less time we
09:36 - would gone for web app or hybrid app but
09:38 - the performance we need the performance
09:40 - is the best and we have a lot of time
09:43 - and we could contribute to a lot of
09:45 - resources we would be going to
09:48 - develop native apps in this training so
09:51 - it provides best performance and all the
09:54 - apps you see around you
09:55 - including
09:56 - instagram whatsapp facebook anything
09:59 - they are all native apps
10:00 - so android app development is the
10:02 - process by which the app is coded and
10:04 - created for
10:06 - devices running the android operating
10:08 - system and the people who code and
10:11 - create the app are called app developers
10:13 - so at the end of this series
10:16 - you would be
10:17 - app developers these are the image
10:19 - resources and how are we going to
10:21 - proceed so firstly we will look over
10:24 - quarterly language master it and learn
10:26 - all the things required
10:28 - okay and then we will jump right into
10:31 - android studio to build apps trust me
10:34 - the process will be much more fun
10:37 - thank you

in this series of video we will be uh covering android app development so we will be starting from introduction to android okay so what is android android is a linux based operating system designed

user which is me when i'm using an app so the end user sends a request when i send a request the api execute the instruction then get the data from the server and respond to the user so when i request the api requests when i request send a request the api executes instruction from this data from the server and get the data and respond to the user so that's what api that's what api does so each year android releases a new version with higher api level and as you can see the names of the api each year when it releases it is in alphabetical order and every time it is a thing to it so what is play store play store is a marketplace that has apps that we download and use all these apps available on the play store can run only on an android device okay so just like app store there is a play store
