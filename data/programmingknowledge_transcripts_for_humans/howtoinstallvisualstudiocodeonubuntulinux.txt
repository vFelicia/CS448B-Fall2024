03:33 - of all so the installation is complete
03:35 - now to open the visual studio code you
03:38 - need to go here at the top and then
03:42 - search for code for example just search

03:51 - open this visual studio code editor and
03:54 - i'm going to minimize my name terminal
03:56 - also and for the first time when we use
03:59 - to you code opens it's going to look
04:01 - like a normal a beta and here i can see

04:29 - so I'm going to close it and then once
04:31 - again when I go here I can see this icon
04:34 - and once I click this icon is going to
04:37 - open the visual studio code again right
04:40 - so for the first time it's it's going to

05:15 - other you know language you are using
05:17 - you can use this section here and the
05:22 - favorite part of mine is this section
05:25 - which is for adding the extension to the

05:59 - clicking and then you know beautify the
06:02 - code this also has the native option of
06:05 - right-clicking in the formatting code so
06:08 - when I go here and for example I will
06:12 - create a file here so for example let's
06:16 - create a file and then when I
06:18 - right-click it has the you know
