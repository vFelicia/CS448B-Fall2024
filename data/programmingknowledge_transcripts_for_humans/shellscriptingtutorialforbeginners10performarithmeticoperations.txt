00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on a
00:02 - shelf scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will learn how to
00:06 - perform arithmetic operations in shell
00:09 - script so let's get started so to
00:13 - perform arithmetic operations you may
00:16 - you know consider using something like
00:19 - this so you can echo and then you can do
00:23 - one plus one but by default echo command
00:27 - takes anything which is written after
00:30 - this echo command as a string so if you
00:34 - run this script you will see it will
00:37 - just dump whatever which is written
00:41 - after the psycho command as it is so
00:43 - it's not performing any automatic
00:46 - operation so how do we achieve it so
00:49 - let's take an example and then we will
00:53 - see how do we do it so I will create two
00:57 - variable num one is equal to 20 for
01:00 - example and number two is equal to five
01:05 - for example okay and then I want to
01:08 - perform some basic mathematics on these
01:12 - integer numbers for example addition
01:15 - subtraction or multiplication division
01:17 - or modulus operation so to perform this
01:22 - you take this number as it is and then
01:27 - for example I want to do addition I can
01:29 - just - num - something like this
01:33 - addition is done like this only but for
01:36 - this you just need to enclose these two
01:41 - variables inside double brackets so you
01:46 - just need to do double bracket this side
01:49 - and double bracket on the other side of
01:53 - this expression like this okay but still
01:58 - you will not be able to achieve your
02:01 - goal so if you do echo still it will
02:05 - print as it is but when you do this
02:09 - dollar symbol or when you add this
02:12 - dollar symbols before your expression
02:16 - this double parentheses expression then
02:19 - let's see what happens and don't forget
02:21 - to give the space here okay and let's
02:25 - run the script and let's see what
02:26 - happens so you can see it has performed
02:29 - the automatic addition on these two
02:33 - variables right so to perform these
02:37 - basic arithmetic operations you need
02:40 - these double to parentheses and then
02:43 - this dollar symbol before them so they
02:47 - could be evaluated as an automatic
02:51 - operation right in a similar way we can
02:55 - perform other automatic operations for
02:58 - example if you want to do subtraction
03:00 - you can do something like this if you
03:03 - want to do multiplication we use
03:04 - asterisk or star whatever you want to
03:08 - call it and then for division you just
03:11 - need to give this forward slash here and
03:13 - there is one more operation which is
03:16 - also considered to be a basic automatic
03:19 - operation which is this modulus
03:21 - operation so let's see what happens so
03:25 - when we run the script one by one we
03:28 - will evaluate all the expressions so
03:31 - what's happening here is in the first
03:33 - echo command we are doing the addition
03:36 - which is 25 which is 20 plus 5 25 which
03:40 - is true then the subtraction which is
03:43 - also true you can see here then the
03:45 - multiple multiplication 20 in x 5 is 100
03:49 - which is also true and then we have done
03:52 - the division which is also true and then
03:56 - we have done the model large modulus
03:58 - operation so modulus operation means
04:02 - that whatever you get as a remainder
04:07 - after dividing the number that remainder
04:12 - will be you know treated as a result
04:15 - okay in our case there is no remainder
04:19 - when we divide 5 by 20 so we get 0 here
04:25 - but if you use for example 21 here then
04:29 - you will get one as a remainder because
04:32 - five will be divided by 21 when it's
04:37 - divided by 21 we get the remainder of
04:39 - one
04:40 - okay so this is how you perform the
04:44 - basic automatic operations in scripting
04:49 - now there is an alternate way of
04:52 - performing automatic operations on your
04:57 - integers and that is by using expr
05:00 - command so to use exp our command we are
05:04 - going to use the same variable but you
05:07 - use only one parenthesis like this here
05:11 - so just use one parenthesis like this
05:16 - and instead of using double brackets or
05:21 - parenthesis you just need our keyword
05:24 - expr okay so you just need to use expr
05:30 - and then for the variables you just need
05:33 - to use them as a normal variable with a
05:36 - dollar symbol something like this so use
05:39 - this kind of a dollar symbol before
05:41 - every you know variable so I'm going to
05:45 - just use this dollar symbol before every
05:48 - variable and this expr command before
05:52 - these operations something like this
05:55 - okay and let's run the script once again
05:59 - and let's see what happens
06:01 - and you can see it's giving us the
06:04 - result but for the multiplication is
06:07 - giving us the error and this says it's a
06:11 - syntax error because in whenever you are
06:16 - using expr this Asterix is not escaped
06:21 - okay so you need to use this Asterix
06:24 - with this escape character which is
06:28 - backslash and then everything will be
06:30 - okay so once again when you run the
06:32 - script you will see the same result as
06:35 - you got with the expression
06:37 - the double parentheses but don't forget
06:40 - to use this escape character before this
06:45 - asterisk for multiplication whenever you
06:47 - are using this expr command okay so this
06:51 - is how you can do the are automatic
06:54 - operation by using these two ways on
06:56 - integers but what happens when you want
07:00 - to perform these automatic operations on
07:03 - for example decimal values this we are
07:06 - going to see in the next video when I'm
07:09 - going to show you how we can perform
07:11 - these automatic operations on some
07:14 - decimal values so stay tuned and please
07:17 - recommend subscribe and bye for now

hey guys welcome to the next video on a shelf scripting tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to perform arithmetic operations in shell script so let's get started so to perform arithmetic operations you may you know consider using something like this so you can echo and then you can do one plus one but by default echo command takes anything which is written after this echo command as a string so if you run this script you will see it will just dump whatever which is written after the psycho command as it is so it's not performing any automatic operation so how do we achieve it so let's take an example and then we will see how do we do it so I will create two variable num one is equal to 20 for example and number two is equal to five for example okay and then I want to perform some basic mathematics on these integer numbers for example addition subtraction or multiplication division or modulus operation so to perform this you take this number as it is and then for example I want to do addition I can just num something like this addition is done like this only but for this you just need to enclose these two variables inside double brackets so you just need to do double bracket this side and double bracket on the other side of this expression like this okay but still you will not be able to achieve your goal so if you do echo still it will print as it is but when you do this dollar symbol or when you add this dollar symbols before your expression this double parentheses expression then let's see what happens and don't forget to give the space here okay and let's run the script and let's see what happens so you can see it has performed the automatic addition on these two variables right so to perform these basic arithmetic operations you need these double to parentheses and then this dollar symbol before them so they could be evaluated as an automatic operation right in a similar way we can perform other automatic operations for example if you want to do subtraction you can do something like this if you want to do multiplication we use asterisk or star whatever you want to call it and then for division you just need to give this forward slash here and there is one more operation which is also considered to be a basic automatic operation which is this modulus operation so let's see what happens so when we run the script one by one we will evaluate all the expressions so what's happening here is in the first echo command we are doing the addition which is 25 which is 20 plus 5 25 which is true then the subtraction which is also true you can see here then the multiple multiplication 20 in x 5 is 100 which is also true and then we have done the division which is also true and then we have done the model large modulus operation so modulus operation means that whatever you get as a remainder after dividing the number that remainder will be you know treated as a result okay in our case there is no remainder when we divide 5 by 20 so we get 0 here but if you use for example 21 here then you will get one as a remainder because five will be divided by 21 when it's divided by 21 we get the remainder of one okay so this is how you perform the basic automatic operations in scripting now there is an alternate way of performing automatic operations on your integers and that is by using expr command so to use exp our command we are going to use the same variable but you use only one parenthesis like this here so just use one parenthesis like this and instead of using double brackets or parenthesis you just need our keyword expr okay so you just need to use expr and then for the variables you just need to use them as a normal variable with a dollar symbol something like this so use this kind of a dollar symbol before every you know variable so I'm going to just use this dollar symbol before every variable and this expr command before these operations something like this okay and let's run the script once again and let's see what happens and you can see it's giving us the result but for the multiplication is giving us the error and this says it's a syntax error because in whenever you are using expr this Asterix is not escaped okay so you need to use this Asterix with this escape character which is backslash and then everything will be okay so once again when you run the script you will see the same result as you got with the expression the double parentheses but don't forget to use this escape character before this asterisk for multiplication whenever you are using this expr command okay so this is how you can do the are automatic operation by using these two ways on integers but what happens when you want to perform these automatic operations on for example decimal values this we are going to see in the next video when I'm going to show you how we can perform these automatic operations on some decimal values so stay tuned and please recommend subscribe and bye for now
