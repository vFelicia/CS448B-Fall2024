00:00 - hello is now in this particular video
00:02 - we'll be learning about the array and
00:03 - cell script okay so you can see already
00:05 - I have created this file that is
00:07 - always.ss and added the shebang so
00:09 - before starting the video let me first
00:11 - describe you what is the address so I
00:13 - will just write it like this so array
00:15 - you you can say like that is array is
00:17 - nothing but uh
00:19 - data structure
00:22 - which is used for storing
00:26 - multiple values in a single variable you
00:31 - can say
00:33 - okay so this is the array simple
00:36 - suppose uh let me tell you the one use
00:38 - case like suppose uh you have to uh
00:40 - store multiple names okay suppose you
00:43 - have to store 10 names so how will you
00:44 - create it like if you don't know
00:46 - mortality you will just do like this
00:47 - name one equal to ayush
00:49 - name to equal to some another name like
00:51 - Uncle name three equal to Let's create
00:55 - some write some name like uh iuc
00:59 - name four equal to Avinash like this
01:02 - okay
01:04 - so this is not a good practice of
01:06 - storing names in different different
01:08 - variables so that's why array came in
01:10 - role for storing multiple values in a
01:12 - single variable okay so uh I will first
01:15 - tell you about uh the like error
01:17 - initialization what is the method of
01:18 - adding initialization like how you can
01:21 - create a legend cell scripting so it's a
01:23 - very simple so you have to just
01:27 - give or add a name suppose uh name list
01:30 - I will give name list equal to this
01:32 - single parenthesis and here you have to
01:35 - store multiple names like ayush like
01:37 - here I will write Ankit
01:40 - ayushi and Avinash okay so here you can
01:44 - see uh all the names has been stored in
01:47 - a single variable that is the name list
01:49 - okay
01:50 - so now you will think about how you will
01:53 - access these arrays okay that's a point
01:55 - like how you will access it so let me
01:58 - tell you first about array indexing okay
02:02 - it is used to
02:07 - access the elements
02:11 - present in an array okay so array
02:15 - indexing is basically used to access the
02:17 - elements in an array so it starts from
02:20 - zero suppose uh this is the address so
02:24 - the first element will have indexing is
02:27 - index 0 second one will have one
02:31 - this one will have two and this one will
02:34 - have three okay so here is four elements
02:37 - so like there is uh like index starts
02:40 - from zero and ends with n minus 1 that
02:43 - is three that is 4 minus 1 that is equal
02:45 - to 3. so so to accessing the elements of
02:49 - an array we will use the you will use
02:52 - these index okay like if I will uh enter
02:55 - the index 0 so at index 0 I use is
02:58 - present at index 1 this Ankit is present
03:00 - index 2 is iuc index three is Avinash
03:03 - okay so now let me tell you first about
03:05 - how you can access the arrays Okay so
03:09 - I will just use the Eco so it will
03:11 - simply print the uh whatever the
03:14 - index present okay so how you can do it
03:17 - Eco dollar and this parent uh curly
03:20 - braces and you have to provide the array
03:23 - name that is name list
03:25 - and the big bracket and the index which
03:27 - you want so I want zero index okay so I
03:31 - will just
03:34 - wait a minute I will just comment out
03:35 - these things yes
03:38 - and I will run this script okay
03:41 - so 11 dot sh so let's run 11 dot sh
03:51 - what happened
03:52 - let's
03:54 - okay I will need to give the particular
03:56 - permission here
03:59 - dot slash eleven yeah
04:01 - so here you can see so this one is
04:04 - printing like that is nothing but a data
04:06 - structure so I will also comment out
04:08 - this thing and I will it will just print
04:10 - up the first index okay
04:13 - wait a minute I write like this eco
04:18 - first index
04:26 - let me run this so here you can see the
04:29 - first index is this similarly I will
04:31 - print all the other three indexes
04:34 - so I will just copy these things
04:37 - and here I will just write the Second
04:41 - and here we will write the Third
04:45 - and here fourth
04:47 - and you have to just change the number
04:49 - here like index number like 0 1 that is
04:52 - 2 and that is 3.
04:54 - just Ctrl save clear dot slash eleven
04:58 - dot sh and yeah so here you can see the
05:01 - first index second index third index
05:03 - fourth index so so here the main thing
05:05 - is that it's like you can access or you
05:08 - can store multiple values in a single
05:09 - variable you can see here so but in this
05:12 - case you you will you have to create a
05:15 - multiple variables to store those values
05:17 - so that's not a good practice so instead
05:19 - of this you can use an array
05:21 - so uh one more thing is like if you want
05:24 - to print the multiple arrays oh it's not
05:26 - multiple arrays all the elements of an
05:28 - array so how you will do there is also
05:29 - the special Syntax for this uh like we
05:32 - we use asterisk okay for printing so you
05:36 - can use like this eco
05:38 - all arrays all array elements
05:44 - so I will just write like this name list
05:49 - and this one and here you can see the
05:51 - asterisk
05:53 - you have to just clear the screen and
05:56 - this one all array elements is here are
05:58 - you shank it I usually and one more uh
06:01 - syntax is there like you can use address
06:04 - also for accessing all the elements
06:08 - so you can see okay
06:11 - so that's it guys for today's video I
06:13 - hope you liked it and yeah one more
06:14 - thing I will upload this code in my
06:17 - GitHub directory or your repository you
06:20 - can say here you will see okay you can
06:23 - get this from cell scripting tutorial I
06:25 - will add it here okay
06:27 - so that's it for today guys and I will
06:29 - meet you in the next video and in the
06:31 - next video we'll be learning about the
06:32 - for loops and all those things okay so
06:34 - that's all for this video guys thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello is now in this particular video we'll be learning about the array and cell script okay so you can see already I have created this file that is always.ss and added the shebang so before starting the video let me first describe you what is the address so I will just write it like this so array you you can say like that is array is nothing but uh data structure which is used for storing multiple values in a single variable you can say okay so this is the array simple suppose uh let me tell you the one use case like suppose uh you have to uh store multiple names okay suppose you have to store 10 names so how will you create it like if you don't know mortality you will just do like this name one equal to ayush name to equal to some another name like Uncle name three equal to Let's create some write some name like uh iuc name four equal to Avinash like this okay so this is not a good practice of storing names in different different variables so that's why array came in role for storing multiple values in a single variable okay so uh I will first tell you about uh the like error initialization what is the method of adding initialization like how you can create a legend cell scripting so it's a very simple so you have to just give or add a name suppose uh name list I will give name list equal to this single parenthesis and here you have to store multiple names like ayush like here I will write Ankit ayushi and Avinash okay so here you can see uh all the names has been stored in a single variable that is the name list okay so now you will think about how you will access these arrays okay that's a point like how you will access it so let me tell you first about array indexing okay it is used to access the elements present in an array okay so array indexing is basically used to access the elements in an array so it starts from zero suppose uh this is the address so the first element will have indexing is index 0 second one will have one this one will have two and this one will have three okay so here is four elements so like there is uh like index starts from zero and ends with n minus 1 that is three that is 4 minus 1 that is equal to 3. so so to accessing the elements of an array we will use the you will use these index okay like if I will uh enter the index 0 so at index 0 I use is present at index 1 this Ankit is present index 2 is iuc index three is Avinash okay so now let me tell you first about how you can access the arrays Okay so I will just use the Eco so it will simply print the uh whatever the index present okay so how you can do it Eco dollar and this parent uh curly braces and you have to provide the array name that is name list and the big bracket and the index which you want so I want zero index okay so I will just wait a minute I will just comment out these things yes and I will run this script okay so 11 dot sh so let's run 11 dot sh what happened let's okay I will need to give the particular permission here dot slash eleven yeah so here you can see so this one is printing like that is nothing but a data structure so I will also comment out this thing and I will it will just print up the first index okay wait a minute I write like this eco first index let me run this so here you can see the first index is this similarly I will print all the other three indexes so I will just copy these things and here I will just write the Second and here we will write the Third and here fourth and you have to just change the number here like index number like 0 1 that is 2 and that is 3. just Ctrl save clear dot slash eleven dot sh and yeah so here you can see the first index second index third index fourth index so so here the main thing is that it's like you can access or you can store multiple values in a single variable you can see here so but in this case you you will you have to create a multiple variables to store those values so that's not a good practice so instead of this you can use an array so uh one more thing is like if you want to print the multiple arrays oh it's not multiple arrays all the elements of an array so how you will do there is also the special Syntax for this uh like we we use asterisk okay for printing so you can use like this eco all arrays all array elements so I will just write like this name list and this one and here you can see the asterisk you have to just clear the screen and this one all array elements is here are you shank it I usually and one more uh syntax is there like you can use address also for accessing all the elements so you can see okay so that's it guys for today's video I hope you liked it and yeah one more thing I will upload this code in my GitHub directory or your repository you can say here you will see okay you can get this from cell scripting tutorial I will add it here okay so that's it for today guys and I will meet you in the next video and in the next video we'll be learning about the for loops and all those things okay so that's all for this video guys thank you
