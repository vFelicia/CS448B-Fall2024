00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - how to use if statement in Java and we
00:11 - have also seen how we can use relational
00:15 - operator inside our if condition now in
00:19 - this video we will see how we can use
00:22 - logical operators in or with our if
00:27 - statement so what are logical operators
00:31 - first of all so for example uh you want
00:35 - to evaluate more than one conditions uh
00:40 - using a single if
00:42 - statement how you can do it you can uh
00:46 - not simply do it like for example I want
00:50 - uh to check uh the scores of the student
00:53 - in some uh particular subject so in
00:57 - subject one a particular student scores
00:59 - 40
01:00 - and subject to a particular student the
01:03 - same student scores 60 marks and I want
01:07 - to check whether these uh two conditions
01:11 - are true or not so I want to check if uh
01:15 - the subject one
01:17 - marks is uh greater than or equal to
01:24 - 35 and I want to also check if he has
01:28 - passed in second subject so I want to
01:30 - check similar kind of condition with the
01:33 - second subject now using logical
01:38 - operators you can check multiple
01:41 - conditions inside single if statement so
01:45 - how you can do it first of all there are
01:48 - two kind or Third Kind is also possible
01:52 - but most Basics are two uh kinds of
01:57 - logical operators first is
02:00 - uh end operator so these double m per
02:05 - shows the end
02:08 - operator and second type of operator is
02:13 - called or operator okay so second type
02:17 - is double pipe and this is called R
02:22 - operator or okay and this should be and
02:28 - operator I can make it
02:32 - bold Now using and operator as the name
02:35 - suggest it checks two condition wherever
02:40 - it's used for example we use this end
02:43 - operator we can uh Define two conditions
02:48 - so one first condition is this one which
02:51 - is subject one marks should be greater
02:54 - than or equal to
02:56 - 35 and let's uh put them inside the
03:01 - bracket so there will be no confusion
03:03 - and the second condition we want to
03:05 - check that subject two Mark should also
03:09 - be greater than or equal to 35 right
03:16 - so using this and operator we are
03:19 - checking both the condition so and
03:22 - operator whenever you use you check
03:25 - first condition and the second condition
03:29 - right
03:31 - so whenever you run the
03:34 - program it checks both the condition so
03:38 - it says the condition is true okay we
03:42 - can also add else
03:44 - statements else and we can just write
03:49 - the condition is false if this is not
03:52 - true right so
03:56 - here false so for example example I want
04:01 - to check or I will uh change the value
04:05 - of subject one for example 20 right now
04:09 - the subject one value is not greater
04:13 - than 35 but the second condition is true
04:16 - subject two value which is 60 is greater
04:18 - than 35 so only one condition is true in
04:22 - this case and the other is not true
04:25 - right so let's try to run the program
04:29 - and it says the condition is false so
04:31 - the end operator evaluates all the
04:36 - condition in the if statement this and
04:39 - this right and in the same way you can
04:42 - add multiple and operators like this so
04:48 - you can just need you just need to add
04:50 - this end and you can evaluate this
04:53 - condition then and other condition then
04:57 - and other condition right so in this way
05:00 - you can evaluate multiple conditions
05:03 - using this and
05:05 - operator now or operator is as the name
05:09 - suggest is it checks for either one of
05:14 - the condition should be true so either
05:17 - this should be true or this should be
05:19 - true so at least one condition is true
05:22 - then it'll execute the statement in the
05:25 - if statement for example right now this
05:28 - condition in our case is true because uh
05:31 - subject 2 has 60 60 is greater than 35
05:34 - this condition is true but this
05:36 - condition is false because subject 1 is
05:38 - equal to 20 which is not greater than 35
05:41 - so only one condition is true in this
05:43 - case and when we run the program it
05:47 - says why it says because yeah we need to
05:50 - add this R operator here right once
05:54 - again run the
05:56 - program and it says the condition is
05:58 - true right right so this R
06:01 - operator checks only one condition or
06:05 - checks for both the condition and if
06:08 - only one condition is true also it will
06:12 - just uh execute your statement side your
06:16 - if statement so
06:18 - or means just checking either I mean if
06:23 - this or this is true it will uh execute
06:27 - the statement but in end statement or
06:29 - all conditions should be true this and
06:32 - this
06:34 - right this is the basic difference uh in
06:39 - and operator and or operator now for
06:43 - example I have both the condition false
06:45 - for example this is 25 so student one is
06:50 - also not passed and student two is also
06:53 - not passed because both are below 32
06:57 - then the
07:00 - condition is false in this case so using
07:04 - R operator we are checking even one
07:07 - condition is true then it will print
07:09 - this but in this case both condition are
07:12 - false that's why it's printing this
07:15 - one so in this CA in this uh way you can
07:19 - use logical operator with if statements
07:23 - so I hope you have enjoyed the video

07:26 - bye for

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use if statement in Java and we have also seen how we can use relational operator inside our if condition now in this video we will see how we can use logical operators in or with our if statement so what are logical operators first of all so for example uh you want to evaluate more than one conditions uh using a single if statement how you can do it you can uh not simply do it like for example I want uh to check uh the scores of the student in some uh particular subject so in subject one a particular student scores 40 and subject to a particular student the same student scores 60 marks and I want to check whether these uh two conditions are true or not so I want to check if uh the subject one marks is uh greater than or equal to 35 and I want to also check if he has passed in second subject so I want to check similar kind of condition with the second subject now using logical operators you can check multiple conditions inside single if statement so how you can do it first of all there are two kind or Third Kind is also possible but most Basics are two uh kinds of logical operators first is uh end operator so these double m per shows the end operator and second type of operator is called or operator okay so second type is double pipe and this is called R operator or okay and this should be and operator I can make it bold Now using and operator as the name suggest it checks two condition wherever it's used for example we use this end operator we can uh Define two conditions so one first condition is this one which is subject one marks should be greater than or equal to 35 and let's uh put them inside the bracket so there will be no confusion and the second condition we want to check that subject two Mark should also be greater than or equal to 35 right so using this and operator we are checking both the condition so and operator whenever you use you check first condition and the second condition right so whenever you run the program it checks both the condition so it says the condition is true okay we can also add else statements else and we can just write the condition is false if this is not true right so here false so for example example I want to check or I will uh change the value of subject one for example 20 right now the subject one value is not greater than 35 but the second condition is true subject two value which is 60 is greater than 35 so only one condition is true in this case and the other is not true right so let's try to run the program and it says the condition is false so the end operator evaluates all the condition in the if statement this and this right and in the same way you can add multiple and operators like this so you can just need you just need to add this end and you can evaluate this condition then and other condition then and other condition right so in this way you can evaluate multiple conditions using this and operator now or operator is as the name suggest is it checks for either one of the condition should be true so either this should be true or this should be true so at least one condition is true then it'll execute the statement in the if statement for example right now this condition in our case is true because uh subject 2 has 60 60 is greater than 35 this condition is true but this condition is false because subject 1 is equal to 20 which is not greater than 35 so only one condition is true in this case and when we run the program it says why it says because yeah we need to add this R operator here right once again run the program and it says the condition is true right right so this R operator checks only one condition or checks for both the condition and if only one condition is true also it will just uh execute your statement side your if statement so or means just checking either I mean if this or this is true it will uh execute the statement but in end statement or all conditions should be true this and this right this is the basic difference uh in and operator and or operator now for example I have both the condition false for example this is 25 so student one is also not passed and student two is also not passed because both are below 32 then the condition is false in this case so using R operator we are checking even one condition is true then it will print this but in this case both condition are false that's why it's printing this one so in this CA in this uh way you can use logical operator with if statements so I hope you have enjoyed the video please raise comment and subscribe and bye for
