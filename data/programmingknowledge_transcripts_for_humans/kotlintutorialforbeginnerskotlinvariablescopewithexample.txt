00:00 - in this video
00:01 - firstly we are going to see what is the
00:03 - scope of a variable and then we we will
00:07 - cover some uh few examples which which
00:10 - will help you get a better clarity of
00:12 - all this con all those concepts that we
00:14 - have learned in the particular playlist
00:16 - of
00:17 - introduction to kotlin okay
00:19 - so what is scope of a variable a scope
00:22 - of a variable is
00:24 - its visibility or a visibility of a
00:26 - particular variable within a piece of
00:28 - code
00:29 - so let us understand with it with this
00:32 - with the example okay so suppose
00:36 - this is a block one block of code one
00:38 - okay
00:40 - so
00:42 - and
00:43 - then there is a for loop and then in
00:45 - between inside the for loop there is a
00:48 - block of
00:49 - code two so uh as the variable a is
00:53 - defined in the main function outside the
00:55 - for loop
00:57 - so the
00:58 - variable a is visible to code one as
01:01 - well as the code two okay so the code
01:04 - one is this thing and the code two is
01:06 - particularly this thing okay or i can
01:08 - say the code one includes this also so
01:10 - basically the code 2 is the for loop
01:14 - and
01:17 - because the variable b
01:19 - is
01:20 - initialized in the
01:22 - for loop
01:23 - inside the loop body and
01:27 - so it is visible to visible only to the
01:31 - code b and not the code one and hence it
01:34 - should be used
01:35 - by
01:36 - this loop body only okay so the variable
01:41 - b cannot be used outside so i cannot use
01:45 - b is equals to 20 here
01:48 - okay when i uh
01:50 - do so it shows an error here because
01:53 - the b variable is not visible to
01:56 - outside the loop
01:58 - okay similarly
02:00 - when i define a function okay
02:03 - a function outside the main function and
02:05 - i
02:06 - use some variables in the
02:09 - other function so the variables which i
02:12 - have used in the other function are not
02:14 - visible to the main function
02:16 - and the body and the
02:18 - and the body of the main function okay
02:20 - so this is about the uh scope of a
02:23 - variable okay so uh now moving forward
02:26 - uh we will uh
02:28 - write a kotlin program to
02:31 - find a
02:33 - factorial of a particular number of a
02:35 - give of a particular number okay
02:37 - so kotlin
02:40 - program to
02:43 - find
02:45 - factorial
02:50 - of a
02:52 - number
02:54 - so in this program you will learn to
02:56 - find the factorial of a number using for
02:59 - loop or you can use while loop also
03:03 - and
03:04 - okay so what is a factorial so a
03:06 - factorial of a number n can be given by
03:09 - uh n factorial
03:11 - and it it is equals to
03:13 - 1 into 2
03:15 - into 3
03:17 - into 4
03:19 - and so on
03:21 - till
03:22 - n
03:23 - okay
03:25 - so
03:26 - now we have to think that how should we
03:29 - proceed in this particular question so
03:32 - uh uh for thinking this uh
03:35 - firstly i should think that uh one loop
03:38 - is required okay we cannot manually
03:40 - multiply the number with two and three
03:42 - and four okay also uh
03:45 - the the particular factor should be
03:47 - multiplied with the i with the
03:51 - incrementer
03:52 - okay
03:54 - so
03:55 - in this program we should we should use
03:58 - loop to loop through all the numbers
04:01 - between one to the given number
04:03 - okay whichever number has been given and
04:06 - uh
04:07 - the product of each number till the
04:10 - number is stored within a variable it
04:12 - must be stored within the variable
04:15 - okay so as we did in the uh
04:18 - as we did for finally finding the sum
04:21 - so uh initially i i'll declare the main
04:23 - function
04:25 - okay inside the main function there is a
04:28 - value
04:29 - num
04:30 - and that is defined so i have to find
04:32 - the
04:33 - factorial for the particular number 10.
04:37 - now i should define a particular
04:41 - variable
04:42 - let's say factorial okay
04:45 - variable let's say factorial in which
04:48 - the factorial is going to be
04:50 - stored
04:53 - okay
04:54 - now this factorial
04:57 - uh okay instead of 10 i i'll do it five
05:02 - okay so this factorial uh
05:04 - should be
05:06 - equals to one on in the starting because
05:09 - this is multiplication if this is if
05:11 - this was a sum as we did in the sum of n
05:13 - natural numbers we would have
05:14 - initialized it with 0 because
05:17 - it we would be adding something to it
05:19 - now
05:20 - we would be multiplying something to it
05:21 - so we have initially initialized it as
05:24 - one because anything multiplied to one
05:26 - is the particular thing
05:28 - okay similarly anything added to the
05:30 - zero is the particular number
05:33 - okay now after declaring a factorial
05:36 - variable uh we should declare we should
05:39 - use the for loop okay so for now
05:42 - from where we have to iterate so i have
05:44 - to iterate from
05:46 - one to
05:48 - the number particular okay
05:51 - so from i to the number
05:54 - uh
05:55 - the factorial okay
05:57 - the factorial
05:59 - is equals to
06:00 - the
06:01 - factorial into number
06:06 - okay so
06:07 - uh from starting we can see that uh
06:10 - what is two factorial
06:12 - or what is one factorial i'll say one
06:14 - factorial one factorial is
06:17 - one
06:18 - okay now what is 2 factorial
06:20 - 2 factorial is
06:22 - 2 into 1 factorial
06:26 - and what is 3 factorial
06:29 - 3 factorial is 3 into 2 into 1 and 2
06:32 - into 1 is any basically 2 factorial now
06:36 - what is 4 factorial
06:38 - 4 factorial is
06:40 - 4 into 3 into 2 into 1
06:42 - now what is 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 4 4
06:45 - into 3 into 2 into 1 so what is 3 into 2
06:47 - into 1 3 into 2 into 1 is 3 factorial
06:51 - okay so i can see that i can say that
06:53 - the factorial
06:55 - is equals to the previous factorial into
06:57 - the current number
06:59 - or instead of number i should have said
07:01 - here i
07:02 - okay that was my fault
07:04 - so
07:05 - what i can do here is i can just write
07:07 - factorial
07:10 - into equals to
07:12 - i
07:14 - okay clear
07:17 - and
07:18 - at the end
07:20 - i should write the print function
07:23 - so print ln
07:25 - uh
07:27 - pack
07:28 - to real
07:32 - of
07:34 - the number
07:39 - is equals to
07:42 - factorial so the factorial variable
07:48 - now
07:50 - what i should do is i should run this
07:52 - program
07:54 - okay
07:56 - so what is 5 factorial 5 factorial is
07:58 - basically 120 4 factorial is 24 okay so
08:02 - this program gives that factorial of 5
08:04 - is 120 so we have successfully
08:09 - made a program which prints the
08:11 - factorial of a particular number okay so
08:13 - that that is all for this video stay
08:15 - tuned

Cleaned transcript:

in this video firstly we are going to see what is the scope of a variable and then we we will cover some uh few examples which which will help you get a better clarity of all this con all those concepts that we have learned in the particular playlist of introduction to kotlin okay so what is scope of a variable a scope of a variable is its visibility or a visibility of a particular variable within a piece of code so let us understand with it with this with the example okay so suppose this is a block one block of code one okay so and then there is a for loop and then in between inside the for loop there is a block of code two so uh as the variable a is defined in the main function outside the for loop so the variable a is visible to code one as well as the code two okay so the code one is this thing and the code two is particularly this thing okay or i can say the code one includes this also so basically the code 2 is the for loop and because the variable b is initialized in the for loop inside the loop body and so it is visible to visible only to the code b and not the code one and hence it should be used by this loop body only okay so the variable b cannot be used outside so i cannot use b is equals to 20 here okay when i uh do so it shows an error here because the b variable is not visible to outside the loop okay similarly when i define a function okay a function outside the main function and i use some variables in the other function so the variables which i have used in the other function are not visible to the main function and the body and the and the body of the main function okay so this is about the uh scope of a variable okay so uh now moving forward uh we will uh write a kotlin program to find a factorial of a particular number of a give of a particular number okay so kotlin program to find factorial of a number so in this program you will learn to find the factorial of a number using for loop or you can use while loop also and okay so what is a factorial so a factorial of a number n can be given by uh n factorial and it it is equals to 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 and so on till n okay so now we have to think that how should we proceed in this particular question so uh uh for thinking this uh firstly i should think that uh one loop is required okay we cannot manually multiply the number with two and three and four okay also uh the the particular factor should be multiplied with the i with the incrementer okay so in this program we should we should use loop to loop through all the numbers between one to the given number okay whichever number has been given and uh the product of each number till the number is stored within a variable it must be stored within the variable okay so as we did in the uh as we did for finally finding the sum so uh initially i i'll declare the main function okay inside the main function there is a value num and that is defined so i have to find the factorial for the particular number 10. now i should define a particular variable let's say factorial okay variable let's say factorial in which the factorial is going to be stored okay now this factorial uh okay instead of 10 i i'll do it five okay so this factorial uh should be equals to one on in the starting because this is multiplication if this is if this was a sum as we did in the sum of n natural numbers we would have initialized it with 0 because it we would be adding something to it now we would be multiplying something to it so we have initially initialized it as one because anything multiplied to one is the particular thing okay similarly anything added to the zero is the particular number okay now after declaring a factorial variable uh we should declare we should use the for loop okay so for now from where we have to iterate so i have to iterate from one to the number particular okay so from i to the number uh the factorial okay the factorial is equals to the factorial into number okay so uh from starting we can see that uh what is two factorial or what is one factorial i'll say one factorial one factorial is one okay now what is 2 factorial 2 factorial is 2 into 1 factorial and what is 3 factorial 3 factorial is 3 into 2 into 1 and 2 into 1 is any basically 2 factorial now what is 4 factorial 4 factorial is 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 now what is 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 4 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 so what is 3 into 2 into 1 3 into 2 into 1 is 3 factorial okay so i can see that i can say that the factorial is equals to the previous factorial into the current number or instead of number i should have said here i okay that was my fault so what i can do here is i can just write factorial into equals to i okay clear and at the end i should write the print function so print ln uh pack to real of the number is equals to factorial so the factorial variable now what i should do is i should run this program okay so what is 5 factorial 5 factorial is basically 120 4 factorial is 24 okay so this program gives that factorial of 5 is 120 so we have successfully made a program which prints the factorial of a particular number okay so that that is all for this video stay tuned
