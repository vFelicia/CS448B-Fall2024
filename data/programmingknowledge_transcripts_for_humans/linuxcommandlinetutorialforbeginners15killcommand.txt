00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - we can use a kill command to kill
00:08 - processes in Linux so let's get started
00:12 - first of all what I'm going to do is I'm
00:14 - going to open my terminal and for
00:16 - example I will start some process so I
00:20 - will go here and I will just start this
00:23 - system settings ok now I know that this
00:29 - is called unity monitor so I will just
00:34 - use kill command so how you can use kill
00:37 - command you can just give a kill and
00:40 - there are some flags so you can give
00:44 - Flags using this minus here and then the
00:47 - name of or PID of the process which you
00:52 - want to kill so if you give PID here
00:55 - okay
00:56 - so what I need to know is I need to know
01:00 - the PID of a process in order to kill it
01:06 - right so first of all I will use a
01:10 - command to know the PID of a process so
01:14 - just write PID off and then the name of
01:18 - the process so I know the name of this
01:21 - process which is this one is unity
01:25 - control center right and I will just
01:28 - press Enter which will give me the PID
01:31 - of this process right so in order to
01:35 - know the PID of a process of program if
01:39 - you know the name then you can find out
01:42 - the PID of this process right now in
01:45 - order to kill it I can just write kill
01:48 - and then the PID so I can just write 3 -
01:52 - 8 6 which is this one this PID and as
01:58 - soon as I will press Enter
02:00 - this is going to be killed or closed
02:03 - right so when I press Enter
02:05 - you can see it's killed right now if
02:10 - this command doesn't kill or is
02:13 - able to kill a process somehow there is
02:16 - a little bit stronger you know flag you
02:21 - can say you can add to this kill come on
02:23 - and this flag will be something like
02:26 - this so I will start the process once
02:29 - again for example this once again and
02:32 - once again I will find the PID and if
02:36 - you close or kill the program and start
02:40 - it again its PID will be changed so it
02:43 - will not be same every time right so you
02:45 - can see its PID is changed right now
02:49 - this time what I want to do is I want to
02:53 - show you one more stronger command which
02:56 - is kill - ki ll in capital and then the
03:02 - PID which is this one right and this
03:05 - will you know close the process it will
03:09 - force the process to be closed but it's
03:13 - not recommended but if you need it you
03:17 - know in some circumstances then you can
03:20 - use it ok and when I press ENTER this
03:22 - will be closed right and one more
03:26 - command is kill - 9 right and then the
03:34 - PID name or a PID number right and this
03:38 - minus 9 is called sig kill command and
03:41 - it's also us very I mean little bit
03:45 - powerful command to kill some processes
03:48 - if they are not killed by this a simple
03:51 - kill command so just use this flag - 9
03:55 - and then most probably this process will
03:58 - be killed
03:59 - ok now sometimes you don't even know the
04:04 - name of the process so how will you find
04:08 - the PID of this process right so in
04:11 - order to find out the list of running
04:16 - processes on your system what you can do
04:18 - is we have seen in the last video how we
04:22 - can use top command right so you can
04:26 - either
04:26 - you stop but I have one more command to
04:29 - show you which you can use to find out
04:32 - the pids of the processes by their names
04:35 - and this command is PS and then you can
04:39 - just write - you X ok so just write px
04:45 - PS and - UX and press ENTER and this
04:49 - will give you this long list of all
04:52 - running processes right and you can see
04:56 - there are different processes running
04:58 - and on the on the left hand side you can
05:01 - see all these values are the PID right
05:06 - so you can just match the you know the
05:10 - program name with the PID and then you
05:13 - know you can use this PID to kill the
05:16 - process now for example I will once
05:18 - again so you can see there is no this
05:22 - unity control center here listed because
05:26 - it's not running right now and there is
05:29 - no process like this and when I start
05:33 - this so I'm going to start this once
05:36 - again and then I will just run this PS
05:40 - UX once again then let's see what
05:43 - happens so I will once again give the
05:45 - same command let me clear the terminal
05:47 - first and then I will just show you this
05:51 - PS minus UX command and now you can see
05:55 - this process is running so we know that
05:59 - this is the name of the process and you
06:01 - can see the PID of the process and then
06:06 - you can kill it so just write kill and
06:08 - then 3 3 1 1 which is the PID okay and
06:14 - then this process will be killed right
06:17 - now in PS command you can also use for
06:23 - example this is going to give you the
06:26 - current user processes right now if you
06:30 - want to see all the processes you can
06:32 - just write PS - aux ok
06:37 - and a I think stand for all
06:40 - so it will show you the processes which
06:43 - is run by all users right so you can see
06:47 - you will see the route and the current
06:51 - user also which is my PC or me for
06:56 - example right and you can see all the
06:59 - list of all the processes which is you
07:02 - know used by all the users right now for
07:06 - example if your Linux operating system
07:11 - is containing multiple users and you
07:14 - want to you know see which processes are
07:17 - run by which user then you can use for
07:22 - example PS and then - you and this will
07:27 - be I think capital use and then the user
07:30 - name so I don't have multiple user but I
07:33 - know that my user name is this one so I
07:37 - will just paste it and then once again
07:40 - press ENTER and it's going to give you
07:42 - all the processes run you know is
07:45 - running by my username for example right
07:49 - so you can see the process name and PID
07:53 - according to this also now there is a
07:56 - last command which I want to show you
07:58 - here so for example I will just write PS
08:03 - and then - capital C and for example our
08:08 - name of a process for example genome
08:11 - terminal right and I will press ENTER
08:14 - and you can see it will list out all the
08:17 - instances or all the you know
08:20 - pause processes which are you know
08:23 - related to this program so there can be
08:26 - multiple for example instances of this
08:29 - program running on your system and then
08:32 - it will show you all the you know list
08:34 - of all the instances so in this way also
08:36 - you can use this PS command
08:39 - to find out the PID of process and then
08:42 - later kill it so I hope you've enjoyed

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use a kill command to kill processes in Linux so let's get started first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my terminal and for example I will start some process so I will go here and I will just start this system settings ok now I know that this is called unity monitor so I will just use kill command so how you can use kill command you can just give a kill and there are some flags so you can give Flags using this minus here and then the name of or PID of the

of a process so just write PID off and then the name of the process so I know the name of this process which is this one is unity control center right and I will just press Enter which will give me the PID of this process right so in order to know the PID of a process of program if you know the name then you can find out the PID of this process right now in order to kill it I can just write kill and then the PID so I can just write 3 8 6 which is this one this PID and as soon as I will press Enter this is going to be killed or closed right so when I press Enter you can see it's killed right now if this command doesn't kill or is able to kill a process somehow there is a little bit stronger you know flag you can say you can add to this kill come on and this flag will be something like this so I will start the process once again for example this once again and once again I will find the PID and if you close or kill the program and start it again its PID will be changed so it will not be same every time right so you can see its PID is changed right now this time what I want to do is I want to show you one more stronger command which is kill ki ll in capital and then the PID which is this one right and this will you know close the process it will force the process to be closed but it's not recommended but if you need it you know in some circumstances then you can use it ok and when I press ENTER this will be closed right and one more command is kill 9 right and then the PID name or a PID number right and this minus 9 is called sig kill command and it's also us very I mean little bit powerful command to kill some processes if they are not killed by this a simple kill command so just use this flag 9 and then most probably this process will be killed ok now sometimes you don't even know the name of the process so how will you find the PID of this process right so in order to find out the list of running processes on your system what you can do is we have seen in the last video how we can use top command right so you can either you stop but I have one more command to show you which you can use to find out the pids of the processes by their names and this command is PS and then you can just write you X ok so just write px PS and UX and press ENTER and this will give you this long list of all running processes right and you can see there are different processes running and on the on the left hand side you can see all these values are the PID right so you can just match the you know the program name with the PID and then you know you can use this PID to kill the process now for example I will once again so you can see there is no this unity control center here listed because it's not running right now and there is no process like this and when I start this so I'm going to start this once again and then I will just run this PS UX once again then let's see what happens so I will once again give the same command let me clear the terminal first and then I will just show you this PS minus UX command and now you can see this process is running so we know that this is the name of the process and you can see the PID of the process and then you can kill it so just write kill and then 3 3 1 1 which is the PID okay and then this process will be killed right now in PS command you can also use for example this is going to give you the current user processes right now if you want to see all the processes you can just write PS aux ok and a I think stand for all so it will show you the processes which is run by all users right so you can see you will see the route and the current user also which is my PC or me for example right and you can see all the list of all the processes which is you know used by all the users right now for example if your Linux operating system is containing multiple users and you want to you know see which processes are run by which user then you can use for example PS and then you and this will be I think capital use and then the user name so I don't have multiple user but I know that my user name is this one so I will just paste it and then once again press ENTER and it's going to give you all the processes run you know is running by my username for example right so you can see the process name and PID according to this also now there is a last command which I want to show you here so for example I will just write PS and then capital C and for example our name of a process for example genome terminal right and I will press ENTER and you can see it will list out all the instances or all the you know pause processes which are you know related to this program so there can be multiple for example instances of this program running on your system and then it will show you all the you know list of all the instances so in this way also you can use this PS command to find out the PID of process and then later kill it so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and
