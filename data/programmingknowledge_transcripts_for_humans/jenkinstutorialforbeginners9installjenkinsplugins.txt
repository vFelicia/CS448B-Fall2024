03:15 - and how to use this plugin also you will
03:18 - be able to see the documentation about

03:34 - to find the plug-in and then we will
03:36 - click this button which says download
03:39 - now and install after restart or the the
03:43 - second way of installing the plug-in is
03:46 - I'm going to show you so for example we
03:48 - want to install this dependency which
03:51 - says matrix authentication strategy I am
03:53 - going to open this in the next tab and
03:56 - in this tab you will be able to see when
03:59 - you scroll down the latest release of
04:02 - this plugin so I'm going to click on the
04:05 - latest release which is going to
04:07 - download the dot HPI file so this
04:10 - plug-in is called matrix out dot SP a
04:14 - file is the plugin right so we are going
04:17 - to save this plug-in and once this file
04:21 - is downloaded this HPI file is
04:23 - downloaded we will go to the Jenkins and
04:26 - you
04:26 - be able to see this advanced tab here
04:29 - and in the Advanced tab when you scroll
04:31 - down a little you will be able to see
04:33 - this option which says upload plugins
04:36 - and you will be able to just click on
04:40 - this button which says browse and then
04:42 - just select your HPI file and upload
04:45 - this file and in this way you will be
04:48 - able to install that plug-in also now we
04:51 - are going to install our plug-in using
04:53 - the Jenkins in the available tab so I'm
04:57 - going to once again search for the role
05:00 - based authentication strategy I'm going
05:04 - to just check on this checkbox and I'm
05:07 - going to click on this button which says
05:09 - download now and install after restart
05:12 - and then you will be able to see this
05:14 - page which says installing plugins or
05:17 - upgrades and then it says role based
05:20 - authentication strategy downloaded
05:22 - successfully we need to restart our
05:25 - Jenkins so we will just check on this
05:28 - checkbox which says restart Jenkins when
05:31 - installation is complete so I'm going to
05:34 - just check on this checkbox so it's
05:36 - going to restart the Jenkins once this
05:39 - plug-in is installed so I'm going to
05:41 - wait for some time until this Jenkins is
05:44 - restarted and now I can see this message
05:46 - which says please wait while Jenkins is
05:48 - getting ready to work after the restart
05:51 - and now the Jenkins has been restarted I
05:54 - think so we need to log in with our
05:56 - credentials and I'm going to say login
05:58 - and after I logged in to the Jenkins I'm
06:01 - going to go to the manage Jenkins
06:04 - section so I'm going to click on manage
06:07 - Jenkins and then I will go to the manage
06:11 - plugins section and then once the
06:14 - plug-in is installed you will be able to
06:16 - see it in the installed tab so I'm going
06:19 - to click on installed and then I'm going
06:22 - to search for role based authentication
06:25 - strategy you can see this plug-in here
06:29 - which says role based authentication
06:31 - strategy so this plug-in is now
06:33 - installed so now we can use this plugin
06:36 - and this we will see in the next video
06:39 - how we
06:40 - use the role based authentication
06:43 - strategy plugin to restrict Jenkins
06:46 - project access to the users and group
06:49 - using rules so stay tuned and please
06:52 - recommend subscribe and bye for now
