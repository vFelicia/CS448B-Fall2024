00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install xampp webserver on your windows
00:06 - 10 operating system so let's get started
00:09 - first of all open your favorite browser
00:11 - and search for XA MPP so just search for
00:15 - XA MPP and just press ENTER and in here
00:20 - first option hopefully which will appear
00:23 - here will be from Apache Friends dot
00:25 - o-r-g so just click this link and this
00:29 - will open this website which is Apache
00:32 - friends don't Watchi and if you want to
00:36 - change the language you can change the
00:38 - language from here for example I want
00:40 - English version of for xmp's so just
00:43 - change the language and now you can see
00:46 - the download options here so we want the
00:50 - option which is for Windows so I will
00:52 - choose xampp for windows so just click
00:55 - it and once you click it the download
00:59 - will start for this example web server
01:02 - now it's a relatively big file so it
01:07 - will take some time to download this
01:10 - xampp executable file so you just need
01:14 - to wait for maybe a few minutes and once
01:18 - it's downloaded we can go further so I
01:20 - will wait for the download and once it
01:23 - will be downloaded we will see the next
01:26 - steps so now my download for this zamp
01:29 - executable file for Windows is complete
01:33 - so I can run this executable file so
01:36 - just click run to execute this
01:38 - executable file and I'm going to
01:41 - minimize my browser and I will wait for
01:44 - the installation to start so first of
01:47 - all it will give you this kind of
01:50 - warning you just need to click yes and
01:52 - then it's going to start the
01:55 - installation wizard for the xampp so
01:59 - just wait for one or two seconds and
02:02 - then the installation will start
02:10 - so now I can see these kind of warnings
02:15 - so don't worry about these warnings they
02:18 - will come while you are installing the
02:21 - exam server so you just need to click
02:24 - okay for these warnings so you may be
02:26 - you know see seeing multiple warning in
02:30 - your case but it's nothing to worry
02:33 - about you can just click OK to proceed
02:36 - further right now you will be able to
02:39 - see this kind of setup interface for
02:42 - exempt so you just need to click Next
02:45 - and these are the programs or apps which
02:49 - will come with your exempt web server so
02:53 - Apache will come my SQL files era
02:56 - mercury mail server will come and Tomcat
03:00 - will come and the program which will
03:03 - come with it is PHP and perl and also it
03:08 - will come with PHP myadmin for managing
03:11 - your MySQL and other you know options
03:15 - you can see so it's a good idea to leave
03:19 - them as default all the checkbox is
03:22 - checked and then click Next and this
03:26 - will be the location where example will
03:29 - be installed so just keep this location
03:32 - in mind we are going to access exempt
03:34 - from this location so in my case it's C
03:37 - colon slash XM ok so just click Next and
03:41 - click Next and click Next and just wait
03:46 - for some time to you know complete the
03:49 - installation so it's going to take some
03:52 - time so just wait for the installation
03:55 - to complete once this green progress bar
03:59 - reaches 100% then we are going to go
04:03 - further now in between you will see this
04:06 - kind of warning or alert window you just
04:09 - need to allow the access so just click
04:12 - allow access and just wait for the
04:16 - installation to complete ok so now the
04:19 - installation for the xampp webserver is
04:22 - complete
04:23 - and now after the completion its will
04:26 - ask you whether you want to start the
04:28 - control panel for the XM to start so
04:32 - just leave this checkbox as checked and
04:34 - click finish
04:35 - ok and once you click finish it's going
04:38 - to start the control panel for your XM
04:43 - web server so the language I want to
04:46 - choose is English so I will just save
04:48 - this language and then it's going to
04:51 - start this type of control panel for
04:53 - example right now in here you can see a
04:57 - different kind of services and the
05:00 - status of these services if they are
05:03 - running or not
05:05 - so to start apache a web server what we
05:08 - need to do is we just need to click
05:10 - start and it's going to start the Apache
05:12 - web server on port 80 right now
05:17 - sometimes what happens is generally if
05:20 - you have other programs installed and
05:24 - sometimes this port 80 is occupied by
05:28 - some other programs then you may need to
05:33 - change this port right so in my case
05:36 - this port 80 is not occupied by any
05:39 - other program so it's successfully
05:43 - running but in most of the cases this
05:46 - port 80 is occupied by some other
05:49 - programs so how to change it and first
05:52 - of all how to check it so the simple way
05:56 - to check if this port 80 is occupied or
06:00 - not is just click this button which says
06:03 - netstat so I'm going to just click
06:06 - netstat and it will show you all the
06:09 - ports which are occupied by some
06:13 - programs so you can see right now port
06:16 - 80 is occupied by my apache web server
06:19 - but it will show you the description of
06:22 - all the services which are occupying
06:25 - some ports right so you can detect which
06:29 - app is occupying this right now in order
06:33 - to change in this port for example I
06:36 - want to change this port from port 80 to
06:40 - both 8080 or something else what I can
06:44 - do is I can just click this config
06:46 - button here and it's going to show me
06:50 - some options for con file and the other
06:54 - files I want to choose this first option
06:56 - which is httpd.conf so just click the
07:00 - first option and it's going to show you
07:02 - this kind of what txt file now when you
07:06 - scroll down you can see here the Apache
07:09 - web server is listening on port 80 which
07:13 - is this one right so in order to change
07:15 - the port simply you just need to write
07:18 - the number of port which you want to you
07:22 - know run the Apache on so for example I
07:25 - want to change it to 8080 just change
07:27 - this one to 8080 and then save this file
07:31 - for example I'm going to just change it
07:33 - here just in case and then I'm going to
07:36 - just save this file and once this file
07:39 - is saved you can once again
07:42 - stop your Apache web server and start it
07:45 - again and now you will be able to see
07:48 - you see here now Apache is running on
07:52 - port 8080 right so if you face some
07:56 - problem just change this port from here
08:01 - okay
08:01 - so I'm going to just revert my changes
08:05 - so it will remain default here and this
08:09 - also put 80 and I'm going to save it
08:12 - again right and I'm going to close it
08:14 - and i will restart my apache server so
08:17 - to stop my server and restart it and now
08:21 - it's running on port 80 okay so once
08:25 - this is done what we need to do next is
08:28 - I will just open my browser and in here
08:33 - I will just enter the localhost okay so
08:40 - now because my apache web server
08:42 - is running so I can just you know enter
08:46 - localhost and check if it's really
08:49 - running or not so I will just right here
08:54 - local host and I will just choose this
09:00 - option which says HTTP colon slash slash
09:03 - localhost and it's going to show this
09:06 - kind of webpage which is for xampp
09:10 - webserver right so this is the welcome
09:13 - page for your example web server okay so
09:17 - now we can see that our xampp web server
09:21 - is running successfully and once you see
09:25 - this web page then you know that
09:28 - everything is okay in your Apache web
09:31 - server now let's try to open a PHP my
09:34 - admin so I will click this option which
09:37 - says PHP myadmin and when I click this
09:41 - it's going to show me error because I
09:44 - haven't started my MySQL option from
09:48 - here so once again open your control
09:50 - panel and then just start this MySQL
09:54 - from here so just click this second
09:57 - button which say start and once your
09:59 - MySQL is started then just click here
10:04 - allow access and once this is done you
10:07 - can refresh this page and now you will
10:11 - be able to see your PHP myadmin also so
10:15 - let's see what happens for this PHP my
10:19 - admin so it's going to open this kind of
10:23 - PHP my admin interface ok so you just
10:27 - need to start the you know apps which
10:31 - you want to run from here
10:33 - now in case this will be port 80 then
10:39 - what will happen for example I will
10:42 - change this Apache to listen on port
10:46 - 8080 for example instead of 80 port 8080
10:50 - so just convert to port 8080 and I will
10:55 - just say
10:55 - this so I'm going to just save this and
10:58 - once this is saved I'm going to close
11:00 - this and I will stop my Apache web
11:03 - server and restart it again
11:06 - okay and now it rests listens on port
11:09 - 8080 and now this time when I go to the
11:13 - browser and I will just write local host
11:18 - here and I will click OK it's going to
11:21 - give me some unknown web page because
11:26 - this is now listening on port 8080 and
11:31 - not the default 80 port so you just need
11:34 - to write after localhost Poulin and then
11:38 - port 8080 the port you are using here
11:41 - right so whatever port you have provided
11:44 - you just need to write here after the
11:47 - colon and press enter and then you will
11:49 - be able to see your Apache or xampp home
11:53 - page okay so this is how you can
11:57 - download and install xampp web server on
12:00 - your Windows 10 operating system I hope
