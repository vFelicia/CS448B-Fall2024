00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - open CV on your Ruben 2 operating system
00:06 - and in the later part of this video I'm
00:08 - going to show you how you can verify the
00:10 - open CV installation by creating a C++
00:14 - project now this procedure which I'm
00:17 - going to show you uh will work with
00:21 - python also so if you want to uh create
00:23 - a python project using this installation
00:26 - it'll work also okay so let's get
00:30 - started now first of all I want to show
00:32 - you that I will be uh following the
00:35 - procedure of installing open CV on
00:38 - Ubuntu from my blog post from my website
00:42 - which is code.com so if you want to copy
00:46 - uh all the command or if you want to
00:48 - know all the command which I have used
00:51 - in this video you can just uh go to this
00:54 - link which I'm going to give you in the
00:56 - description and then copy all these
00:59 - command from here and here are all the
01:01 - detailed uh instruction how to install
01:04 - open CV and how you can create your
01:07 - first C++ uh project with open CV okay
01:12 - so let's get started so first of all I'm
01:15 - going to open my terminal and the first
01:18 - step is to update my open to operating
01:22 - system so just give this command here P
01:24 - sudo apt minus get update okay so sud
01:31 - sudo app minus get update and then give
01:34 - your open Do's password it's going to uh
01:37 - get all the
01:39 - updates and once this is done we are
01:41 - going to give this command second
01:43 - command is Pudo app get upgrade so just
01:47 - give uh this command sudo app get
01:49 - upgrade and then give y here so the
01:53 - upgrade is finished and then I'm going
01:56 - to go to the next step you can see this
01:58 - is the next step to install all the
02:01 - dependencies which are for example build
02:04 - essential for C++ and C cake for making
02:08 - your uh open CV repositories get for
02:12 - cloning and other dependencies for open
02:15 - CV okay so I'm going to just copy this
02:18 - one by one and paste it here so let me
02:20 - clear the terminal and then paste this
02:23 - command and uh I'm going to uh just go
02:27 - to the start position delete this dollar
02:31 - symbol and then press enter is going to
02:34 - install these dependencies first of all
02:36 - and by the time uh these dependencies
02:39 - are installing I'm going to copy the
02:42 - second command which is this one which
02:44 - is for the support of python and other
02:48 - libraries okay so just copy the second
02:50 - command so now the first command is
02:52 - finished let me once again clear the
02:55 - terminal and then let's give the second
02:58 - command which is sudo app get install
03:01 - python 3.5 minus Dev Python 3 minus numy
03:06 - and these other libraries okay so I'm
03:09 - going to give this command and press
03:12 - Y and once this is done we are going to
03:15 - execute the third command for the
03:18 - dependencies which is this one so let me
03:20 - copy this command and then I'm going to
03:24 - just uh give this command after this
03:27 - installation is finished so the second
03:29 - command is also finished let me clear
03:31 - the terminal and let me give the third
03:34 - command and let's give the third command
03:37 - now so and press
03:39 - Y and let's wait for the command to
03:43 - execute and install all the dependencies
03:47 - so the dependency installation process
03:49 - is finished and let's go and see what's
03:52 - the next uh step so in the next step we
03:55 - are going to get the open CV and these
03:58 - open CV the uh repositories are hosted
04:02 - on the GitHub uh by the username itc's
04:07 - and open CV okay so we are going to just
04:11 - uh get these repositories in our opt uh
04:15 - folder or directory and then we are
04:18 - going to make uh these repositories
04:21 - right so let me clear the terminal once
04:25 - again and now give the pseudo SE U
04:30 - command because we are going to go
04:32 - inside our opt folder which requires
04:35 - pseudo privileges right and then we
04:39 - going to go to the CD opt folder so
04:43 - let's go to the opt and in the opt we
04:46 - are going to clone this git repository
04:50 - right so just give this command to co
04:53 - clone the repository and we have already
04:56 - installed git in our previous Command
04:59 - right so this git command will work so
05:03 - get clone which is going to clone this
05:05 - open CV uh repository on our opt
05:09 - directory so the cloning of the first
05:12 - repository is done and let's clone the
05:15 - second
05:16 - repository and the second repository was
05:19 - this get clone https uh open cvore
05:24 - contri dogit right this is the second
05:27 - repository we are cloning
05:30 - so it will be cloned in few seconds and
05:34 - then we will go to the next step which
05:37 - is to make our binaries so the cloning
05:41 - of the next repository is also done so
05:45 - we can go to the next step and let's see
05:47 - what the next step is so here is the
05:50 - next step so now once uh both the
05:55 - repositories are cloned now we just need
05:58 - to build an install open CV and these
06:02 - are the steps for building and uh you
06:05 - know installing the open CV so we just
06:08 - need to seed into the open CV directory
06:10 - and create a release uh directory inside
06:13 - that and in the release directory we
06:16 - just need to run this command Okay so
06:19 - let's uh do that so let's first of all
06:23 - LS into our opt uh directory and you can
06:27 - see we have two directories created one
06:31 - is open CV which is created by cloning
06:34 - of the first repository and other is
06:37 - open CV contri which is uh created by
06:41 - the cloning of the second repository
06:43 - right so we will CD into the first
06:47 - repository which is open CV so just give
06:50 - the command CD open CV and now we are in
06:55 - the opt slopen CV directory right here
06:59 - we are going to create uh a directory
07:02 - called release and once this directory
07:04 - is created we will just CD into that
07:08 - directory so just to CD release okay so
07:12 - now we are in opt forward slop CV slash
07:17 - relase right now inside this uh
07:21 - directory we just need to give uh this
07:24 - command so we have given uh the CD
07:27 - release command and now we just need to
07:29 - give this cmake command which is a very
07:32 - long command so just copy this uh
07:36 - command and we are going to give this
07:38 - Command right which is the cmake so
07:41 - let's clear the terminal first of all
07:43 - and now let's give the cake command okay
07:47 - so this is the command we just need to
07:49 - give cmake and then all the flags
07:52 - associated with the cake okay and here
07:55 - you can see the last option is important
07:58 - here last uh option here which is the
08:01 - directory opt slop CV okay so this
08:05 - operation of cmake will happen in opt
08:08 - slop CV right so just give this command
08:12 - it's going to build open CV using cmake
08:15 - now the cmake command is finished so
08:17 - let's see what the next step is so after
08:20 - the cmake command we just need to
08:23 - make uh our binaries and then give the
08:27 - make install command okay and then LD
08:29 - config so let's issue the make Command
08:32 - and then we will do the make install so
08:34 - just write make minus j4 j4 is for the
08:40 - jobs so make minus j4 okay and it's
08:45 - going to make your binaries and then we
08:48 - are going to issue the make install
08:50 - command so the make Command is also
08:52 - finished so let's give the make install
08:55 - command now so let me clear the terminal
08:59 - and let me me give
09:00 - make install command and once this make
09:04 - install command is finished then we will
09:07 - do the LD config and LD config is going
09:12 - to create the necessary link for the
09:15 - open CV okay so the make install is also
09:18 - finished so let's give
09:21 - LD config command here you can also
09:25 - verify these commands from here so after
09:28 - make we have given make install and then
09:31 - LD config right and then we are going to
09:34 - exit from the Pudo and then we will go
09:37 - to our home directory okay so let's do
09:41 - the same so LD config which is going to
09:44 - create all the necessary links and then
09:46 - we just need to exit from our
09:48 - Pudo so we are out of our pseudo and now
09:54 - we just need to do CD till there if it's
09:57 - necessary in your case uh I was already
10:00 - in my home directory so I do not
10:03 - necessarily need to give this command
10:05 - but uh I just gave this Command right
10:08 - now let's verify that uh which version
10:11 - of open CV we have installed and for
10:13 - that we have uh this command let me
10:16 - scroll down and we have this command PKG
10:19 - minus config minus minus uh mod version
10:23 - open CV okay so let's give uh this
10:26 - command here and let me remove this
10:30 - dollar and then press enter and you can
10:33 - see the version of open CV in our case
10:35 - is
10:37 - 3.3.0 okay now let's create some C++
10:42 - project and let's uh see how we can uh
10:46 - compile US Open CV C++ uh project so I
10:51 - will go down a little and I can see
10:54 - these instructions here right so you can
10:58 - create this directory in which uh you
11:01 - will uh you know create your main.cpp
11:04 - file so let me do this so let me create
11:08 - a directory called CPP test or open CV
11:11 - test so
11:12 - mkd CPP
11:16 - uncore test and then let's go to that
11:20 - directory CPP test and inside the CPP
11:24 - test I'm going
11:25 - to create a main. CPP file so main.
11:32 - CPP and I will need a picture or a image
11:37 - for this program right so let me open
11:40 - this
11:41 - main.cpp and let me open the folder
11:45 - Explorer and let me show you this main.
11:48 - CPP there right you can see in here I
11:50 - have CPP test directory and inside CPP
11:54 - test I have created this main. CPP using
11:57 - the touch Command right so I'm going to
11:59 - open this uh
12:00 - main.cpp using my G addit editor you can
12:05 - use any other editor as you wish so
12:08 - right now this is empty file right this
12:10 - main.cpp is empty and in this uh empty
12:14 - main.cpp I'm going to just copy this uh
12:18 - program which I have provided on this uh
12:20 - website and then I'm going to compile
12:23 - this so let me copy all this code which
12:26 - I have uh given here
12:30 - and let me just paste it here okay and
12:33 - you can see here I need a sample JPEG
12:37 - file also to uh open it right so in this
12:43 - here in this directory I need a sample.
12:46 - JPEG image so what I'm going to do is
12:49 - I'm going to take a screenshot of uh my
12:54 - desktop so let me take a screenshot and
12:57 - let me save this screenshot with this
12:59 - which is same sample. uh jpeg here or in
13:04 - my case it's a PNG so I will just say
13:07 - sample.png file okay and I will save it
13:10 - in my pictures directory and I just need
13:13 - to copy that from my pictures directory
13:16 - so
13:16 - sample.png let me copy this from here
13:20 - and let me go to the home CPP test and
13:24 - then let me paste it in the same
13:26 - directory in which my main.cpp file is
13:30 - so in this directory I have main.cpp and
13:33 - sample.png and because it's a sample.png
13:36 - I will just change the extension here
13:39 - PNG right because I have uh PNG not JPEG
13:45 - and now I'm going to just compile my uh
13:47 - program and then I'm going to run it so
13:50 - to compile my program you can see uh
13:52 - this command which is going to compile
13:55 - your program and create a output uh
14:00 - binary file or executable file so
14:03 - g++ main. CPP minus o output so this is
14:07 - our executable file and you just need to
14:10 - give this uh command there okay let's uh
14:14 - build so our main.cpp is compiled and
14:17 - you can see there is one more uh
14:20 - executable file which is created which
14:21 - is output right so let's run the
14:26 - output and once you run it you can see
14:29 - it has opened uh this image in our case
14:33 - Okay so this is our display window and
14:35 - it has opened this display window here
14:38 - let's run it once again to verify and
14:41 - you can see this is the display window
14:44 - which is opened by our open CV uh
14:48 - program okay so now we know that our
14:51 - open CV is working fine with our CPP
14:55 - project so this is how you can uh
14:57 - download and install open open CV on
14:59 - your Ubuntu operating system and you can
15:01 - create your first C++ project I hope you
15:04 - have enjoyed this video please RIT
15:05 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install open CV on your Ruben 2 operating system and in the later part of this video I'm going to show you how you can verify the open CV installation by creating a C++ project now this procedure which I'm going to show you uh will work with python also so if you want to uh create a python project using this installation it'll work also okay so let's get started now first of all I want to show you that I will be uh following the procedure of installing open CV on Ubuntu from my blog post from my website which is code.com so if you want to copy uh all the command or if you want to know all the command which I have used in this video you can just uh go to this link which I'm going to give you in the description and then copy all these command from here and here are all the detailed uh instruction how to install open CV and how you can create your first C++ uh project with open CV okay so let's get started so first of all I'm going to open my terminal and the first step is to update my open to operating system so just give this command here P sudo apt minus get update okay so sud sudo app minus get update and then give your open Do's password it's going to uh get all the updates and once this is done we are going to give this command second command is Pudo app get upgrade so just give uh this command sudo app get upgrade and then give y here so the upgrade is finished and then I'm going to go to the next step you can see this is the next step to install all the dependencies which are for example build essential for C++ and C cake for making your uh open CV repositories get for cloning and other dependencies for open CV okay so I'm going to just copy this one by one and paste it here so let me clear the terminal and then paste this command and uh I'm going to uh just go to the start position delete this dollar symbol and then press enter is going to install these dependencies first of all and by the time uh these dependencies are installing I'm going to copy the second command which is this one which is for the support of python and other libraries okay so just copy the second command so now the first command is finished let me once again clear the terminal and then let's give the second command which is sudo app get install python 3.5 minus Dev Python 3 minus numy and these other libraries okay so I'm going to give this command and press Y and once this is done we are going to execute the third command for the dependencies which is this one so let me copy this command and then I'm going to just uh give this command after this installation is finished so the second command is also finished let me clear the terminal and let me give the third command and let's give the third command now so and press Y and let's wait for the command to execute and install all the dependencies so the dependency installation process is finished and let's go and see what's the next uh step so in the next step we are going to get the open CV and these open CV the uh repositories are hosted on the GitHub uh by the username itc's and open CV okay so we are going to just uh get these repositories in our opt uh folder or directory and then we are going to make uh these repositories right so let me clear the terminal once again and now give the pseudo SE U command because we are going to go inside our opt folder which requires pseudo privileges right and then we going to go to the CD opt folder so let's go to the opt and in the opt we are going to clone this git repository right so just give this command to co clone the repository and we have already installed git in our previous Command right so this git command will work so get clone which is going to clone this open CV uh repository on our opt directory so the cloning of the first repository is done and let's clone the second repository and the second repository was this get clone https uh open cvore contri dogit right this is the second repository we are cloning so it will be cloned in few seconds and then we will go to the next step which is to make our binaries so the cloning of the next repository is also done so we can go to the next step and let's see what the next step is so here is the next step so now once uh both the repositories are cloned now we just need to build an install open CV and these are the steps for building and uh you know installing the open CV so we just need to seed into the open CV directory and create a release uh directory inside that and in the release directory we just need to run this command Okay so let's uh do that so let's first of all LS into our opt uh directory and you can see we have two directories created one is open CV which is created by cloning of the first repository and other is open CV contri which is uh created by the cloning of the second repository right so we will CD into the first repository which is open CV so just give the command CD open CV and now we are in the opt slopen CV directory right here we are going to create uh a directory called release and once this directory is created we will just CD into that directory so just to CD release okay so now we are in opt forward slop CV slash relase right now inside this uh directory we just need to give uh this command so we have given uh the CD release command and now we just need to give this cmake command which is a very long command so just copy this uh command and we are going to give this Command right which is the cmake so let's clear the terminal first of all and now let's give the cake command okay so this is the command we just need to give cmake and then all the flags associated with the cake okay and here you can see the last option is important here last uh option here which is the directory opt slop CV okay so this operation of cmake will happen in opt slop CV right so just give this command it's going to build open CV using cmake now the cmake command is finished so let's see what the next step is so after the cmake command we just need to make uh our binaries and then give the make install command okay and then LD config so let's issue the make Command and then we will do the make install so just write make minus j4 j4 is for the jobs so make minus j4 okay and it's going to make your binaries and then we are going to issue the make install command so the make Command is also finished so let's give the make install command now so let me clear the terminal and let me me give make install command and once this make install command is finished then we will do the LD config and LD config is going to create the necessary link for the open CV okay so the make install is also finished so let's give LD config command here you can also verify these commands from here so after make we have given make install and then LD config right and then we are going to exit from the Pudo and then we will go to our home directory okay so let's do the same so LD config which is going to create all the necessary links and then we just need to exit from our Pudo so we are out of our pseudo and now we just need to do CD till there if it's necessary in your case uh I was already in my home directory so I do not necessarily need to give this command but uh I just gave this Command right now let's verify that uh which version of open CV we have installed and for that we have uh this command let me scroll down and we have this command PKG minus config minus minus uh mod version open CV okay so let's give uh this command here and let me remove this dollar and then press enter and you can see the version of open CV in our case is 3.3.0 okay now let's create some C++ project and let's uh see how we can uh compile US Open CV C++ uh project so I will go down a little and I can see these instructions here right so you can create this directory in which uh you will uh you know create your main.cpp file so let me do this so let me create a directory called CPP test or open CV test so mkd CPP uncore test and then let's go to that directory CPP test and inside the CPP test I'm going to create a main. CPP file so main. CPP and I will need a picture or a image for this program right so let me open this main.cpp and let me open the folder Explorer and let me show you this main. CPP there right you can see in here I have CPP test directory and inside CPP test I have created this main. CPP using the touch Command right so I'm going to open this uh main.cpp using my G addit editor you can use any other editor as you wish so right now this is empty file right this main.cpp is empty and in this uh empty main.cpp I'm going to just copy this uh program which I have provided on this uh website and then I'm going to compile this so let me copy all this code which I have uh given here and let me just paste it here okay and you can see here I need a sample JPEG file also to uh open it right so in this here in this directory I need a sample. JPEG image so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a screenshot of uh my desktop so let me take a screenshot and let me save this screenshot with this which is same sample. uh jpeg here or in my case it's a PNG so I will just say sample.png file okay and I will save it in my pictures directory and I just need to copy that from my pictures directory so sample.png let me copy this from here and let me go to the home CPP test and then let me paste it in the same directory in which my main.cpp file is so in this directory I have main.cpp and sample.png and because it's a sample.png I will just change the extension here PNG right because I have uh PNG not JPEG and now I'm going to just compile my uh program and then I'm going to run it so to compile my program you can see uh this command which is going to compile your program and create a output uh binary file or executable file so g++ main. CPP minus o output so this is our executable file and you just need to give this uh command there okay let's uh build so our main.cpp is compiled and you can see there is one more uh executable file which is created which is output right so let's run the output and once you run it you can see it has opened uh this image in our case Okay so this is our display window and it has opened this display window here let's run it once again to verify and you can see this is the display window which is opened by our open CV uh program okay so now we know that our open CV is working fine with our CPP project so this is how you can uh download and install open open CV on your Ubuntu operating system and you can create your first C++ project I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
