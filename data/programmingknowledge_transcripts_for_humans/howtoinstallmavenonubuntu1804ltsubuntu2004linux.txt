00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - configure maven on your Ubuntu operating
00:07 - system so let's get started so I have
00:10 - just collected and written all the
00:15 - commands which you will need to install
00:17 - maven and configure maven on your open
00:21 - to operating system so all these
00:24 - commands I'm going to give you in the
00:26 - description of this video so you can
00:28 - directly copy them and paste them into
00:30 - your terminal and you will be good to go
00:34 - so first of all we need to install Java
00:37 - in order to install maven so let's start
00:41 - with the installation of Java so for
00:44 - installing Java we will need these four
00:46 - commands so I'm going to minimize this
00:48 - editor and I'm going to open the
00:51 - terminal so the first command is this
00:54 - sudo add - apt - repository PPA colon
00:59 - web up8 team four slash Java and then
01:04 - press ENTER and then give your open to
01:07 - spaz word and then press ENTER and once
01:10 - again press ENTER and once this command
01:12 - is finished I'm going to paste the
01:14 - second command in order to install Java
01:16 - 8 so this is the second command which is
01:18 - sudo apt install Oracle - Java 8 -
01:22 - Installer press ENTER in order to
01:25 - install Java 8 so now we can see this
01:27 - message here which says Oracle JDK 8 is
01:31 - installed on my system and then there is
01:34 - an important message here and this
01:37 - message says to set Oracle Java JDK 8 as
01:41 - default we need to install Oracle - Java
01:45 - 8 - set - default so we are going to run
01:49 - this command which is given in the
01:51 - example which is this one so I'm going
01:53 - to just copy this command in order to
01:56 - set Java 8 as the default Java version
02:00 - so just copy this command which is sudo
02:03 - apt install Oracle - Java 8 - set -
02:07 - default and paste on to your terminal
02:09 - and then press ENTER and then
02:13 - why and once this command is finished we
02:16 - are going to check the Java version so
02:18 - I'm going to just write Java - - version
02:22 - and then press ENTER and this command
02:25 - gives us some problem I can see could
02:28 - not create Java Virtual Machine so
02:30 - instead of giving double - I think the
02:34 - command is Java - version and you can
02:37 - see this version Java version one point
02:39 - eight point zero point something so if
02:42 - you see this version here that Java
02:45 - eight is installed on your system
02:47 - so now once Java is installed on your
02:49 - abun to operating system we will move to
02:51 - the next step which is actually
02:53 - installing maven so first of all let's
02:56 - see which is the latest version of maven
02:59 - available on the maven website so you
03:02 - just need to go to maven dot Apache dot
03:05 - o-r-g and you will be able to see this
03:08 - Downloads button here or you can also
03:12 - click on this download option so we are
03:15 - going to click on that and I will scroll
03:18 - down and you can see Apache maven three
03:21 - point five point three is the latest
03:24 - version at the time of making this video
03:27 - so we will install this version on our
03:30 - open to operating system so now what we
03:34 - need to do first is we need to CD to the
03:37 - opt directory so I'm going to open the
03:40 - terminal once again and I will just go
03:44 - to the opt directory and then we will
03:49 - download this maven tar dot GZ file so
03:54 - you can see the version we will download
03:57 - is three point five point three which is
04:01 - this one and if you want to know the
04:04 - location of this tar god key that file
04:08 - you can just right click and then copy
04:11 - the location from here and then you will
04:14 - be able to see the location of this star
04:17 - dot cheese that file for the maven okay
04:20 - so I'm going to just copy this command
04:23 - in order to download this
04:26 - gzip file so I'm going to just paste
04:30 - this command which is pseudo W get and
04:32 - the link for this on cheese at file
04:37 - and then I'm going to press ENTER and
04:40 - I'm going to provide my Ubuntu's
04:41 - password and then press Enter
04:43 - which is going to download this tar dodd
04:46 - cheese at file let's see what's the next
04:49 - step next step is obviously we need to
04:51 - enter this so this is the command to
04:54 - extract this file which is sudo tar
04:57 - minus XF and then the tar file name and
05:02 - then I'm going to just press enter once
05:04 - again which is going to extract this
05:07 - file into a folder let's do a LS and
05:09 - let's see what folder we have here so
05:13 - you can see now we have Apache - maven -
05:17 - three point five point three folder now
05:20 - the next step is to move this folder
05:23 - into more understandable form which is
05:29 - Apache maven so we will just remove this
05:33 - extension from here so I'm going to just
05:35 - use this move command to just move this
05:40 - folder into Apache maven folder so just
05:44 - give this command sudo MV your Apache
05:47 - maven folder name and then this will be
05:50 - the destination and I'm going to just
05:53 - press ENTER and I will do LS once again
05:56 - and now you can see our folder name is
06:00 - changed to Apache - maven without the
06:04 - version now the next step is to give
06:09 - this command so I'm going to just copy
06:11 - this command and let me clear the
06:14 - terminal so we will see this command
06:16 - clearer so I'm going to just paste this
06:19 - command and then press ENTER and this
06:21 - command is successful now so we will
06:23 - just move to the next section which is
06:27 - configuring the Apache maven environment
06:30 - so for that we need to go to the etc'
06:36 - profile D folder so I'm going to just
06:39 - see
06:39 - to the et Cie profile D folder so I will
06:43 - just write CD or slash et Cie profile D
06:48 - and inside this folder we are going to
06:51 - create a new file with the name maven
06:54 - dot Sh so you can see using this command
06:59 - you can create dot H file you can use
07:03 - your favorite editor I'm using G added
07:06 - for editing this file you can use Nano
07:10 - or whim or any other editor which you
07:12 - like to create and edit this file so I'm
07:15 - going to use this pseudo G edit maven
07:19 - dot SH which is going to just create
07:22 - this file and open this file in the
07:26 - editor now the next step is to just copy
07:31 - all this text and then paste it into
07:37 - this maven dot SH file and what this
07:41 - text is doing is just exporting some of
07:45 - the environment variables for example
07:47 - Java home environment variable and then
07:51 - m2 home environment variable this is the
07:54 - location and then maven home environment
07:57 - variable and the path environment
07:59 - variable so just copy and paste these
08:03 - exports into your maven dot H file and
08:08 - just save it and then close it so once
08:11 - you have created and copied and pasted
08:14 - this text into your maven dot Sh file we
08:19 - just need to change the permission of
08:21 - this maven dot SH file in order to
08:24 - execute it and this will be the command
08:27 - to change the permission of this maven
08:30 - dot SH and what this chmod command does
08:35 - is so I'm going to just clear the
08:37 - terminal once again and I'm going to
08:39 - just paste this command and this command
08:41 - is sudo chmod plus x maven dot Sh so
08:46 - this is going to change the permission
08:48 - of this maven dot SH to become an
08:52 - executable
08:53 - so I'm going to just give this come on
08:55 - and then we will do LS - al and then we
09:01 - can do maven dot SH and you will see
09:05 - here X is added to the permission of
09:09 - this file so now this file becomes an
09:12 - executable file now the last thing we
09:15 - need to do here is to just give the
09:18 - source command for this maven dot Sh in
09:22 - order to set all the environment
09:23 - variables so just give source come on
09:27 - and then maven dot SH and then press
09:29 - Enter which is going to refresh all the
09:31 - environment variables so now maven is
09:34 - installed on your system and to check
09:36 - whether maven is working you can just
09:40 - provide this Kevon mbn and then - -
09:44 - version and then press enter and you
09:47 - will see which version of maven you have
09:49 - installed so we have installed a three
09:52 - point five point three maven version so
09:54 - if you see all this text that means
09:57 - maven is working fine on your open to
10:02 - operating system now in order to do the
10:04 - quick test you can also go on this maven
10:09 - website which is maven Apache dot o-r-g
10:14 - so I'm going to just go to the home page
10:17 - of this website and then in order to
10:20 - just test whether maven is working fine
10:24 - or not you can go to this section which
10:27 - says use and then there is a five minute
10:31 - test here so I'm going to click on this
10:33 - and you can see first of all you can
10:36 - check the maven version using this MVN -
10:40 - - version command and if you see text
10:43 - like this then it's installed perfectly
10:47 - on your system now in order to create a
10:49 - sample project you can just follow these
10:52 - command which is given under the
10:54 - creating a project so let's do that I'm
10:57 - going to just copy the first command and
11:01 - first of all I will go to my home folder
11:04 - so I will just could do CD
11:07 - and I'm going to clear the terminal and
11:09 - I'm going to do LS and let's create our
11:12 - directory in which we are going to
11:14 - create this maven projects well mkdir
11:18 - MBN underscore work space and then I'm
11:25 - going to CD into this ambien workspace
11:28 - and now I'm going to just paste this
11:30 - command which I have copied which is
11:32 - this one and I'm going to just press
11:36 - Enter
11:37 - we're just going to create this my - app
11:42 - directory first of all it will download
11:44 - all the requirements from the maven
11:47 - repository it will take some time so
11:49 - just wait for that so now this command
11:51 - is successful so now it says we need to
11:54 - CD to my app folder so we will do that
11:57 - I'm going to just LS first of all here
12:01 - and you can see my app folder is created
12:04 - so we will just CD into my app folder
12:07 - and then you will be able to see this
12:11 - kind of folder structure there I'm going
12:14 - to do LS - L air - just see you can see
12:19 - pom dot XML file is there and then the
12:22 - source directory is there so let's build
12:25 - our project using ambient package
12:28 - command which is this one so I'm going
12:30 - to just copy this ambient package come
12:34 - on and I'm going to clear the terminal
12:36 - and then I'm going to just say MB in a
12:39 - package and then press ENTER and this is
12:43 - going to just build my project once
12:46 - again and if I see build successful
12:50 - message then package command worked
12:53 - successfully and everything is working
12:55 - fine regarding maven on my open to
12:59 - operating system so I can see build
13:01 - success that means maven is working fine
13:04 - on my open to operating system so that's
13:08 - it for this video I hope you've enjoyed
13:09 - this video please rate comment subscribe
13:11 - and bye for now

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and configure maven on your Ubuntu operating system so let's get started so I have just collected and written all the

so this is the second command which is sudo apt install Oracle Java 8 Installer press ENTER in order to install Java 8 so now we can see this message here which says Oracle JDK 8 is installed on my system and then there is an important message here and this message says to set Oracle Java JDK 8 as default we need to install Oracle Java 8 set default so we are going to run this command which is given in the example which is this one so I'm going to just copy this command in order to set Java 8 as the default Java version so just copy this command which is sudo apt install Oracle Java 8 set default and paste on to your terminal and then press ENTER and then why and once this command is finished we are going to check the Java version so I'm going to just write Java version and then press
