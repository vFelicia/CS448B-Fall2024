00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:06 - how to design a simple login app in
00:10 - Android Studio so we have completed in
00:13 - the last video the design part of our
00:17 - simple login app in this video we will
00:20 - see how to write the code behind uh this
00:25 - uh button or login button so that we can
00:27 - perform some actions uh or validate
00:30 - username and password and then perform
00:32 - some action on button click so let's get
00:36 - started now once we have uh completed
00:39 - our design now we will go to
00:43 - the Java folder here and in here we will
00:48 - go to the login. Java folder okay so we
00:53 - already designed our you know login page
00:57 - here so what you can do is you can can
01:00 - go to the
01:02 - login open login from here or directly
01:06 - go to the Java folder and in here go to
01:09 - login. Java folder okay and this is the
01:14 - Java code behind that login page
01:19 - activity right now in here we are going
01:22 - to uh declare some variables inside our
01:27 - login class and then we will add a
01:30 - button action perform uh method to our
01:33 - on create method so let's declare some
01:37 - variables we will declare two addit text
01:41 - boxes for username and password and we
01:44 - will declare one text view for attempt
01:48 - and one for button so let's uh do
01:58 - this
02:20 - so now we have uh declared all our
02:23 - variables I have uh declared one extra
02:26 - variable here which is called int ATT M
02:30 - counter so we want to provide minimum
02:34 - attempt or maximum attempt to the user
02:37 - so that uh you know for example we just
02:39 - want to provide five attempts to the
02:41 - user to uh try login and password and if
02:45 - these attempts are uh gone then we want
02:50 - to uh do some other option right so now
02:55 - our variables are declared and now we
02:58 - are ready to create our
03:00 - uh button click event so I will name my
03:04 - uh method as
03:07 - public
03:10 - void
03:12 - login
03:14 - button and in here we will just cast all
03:19 - these variables which we have declared
03:21 - here so we will cast a username password
03:26 - and uh the attempt and the button uh
03:29 - variable
03:58 - El
04:00 - so now we have casted all our four uh
04:04 - variables which we have declared here
04:07 - and now we are going to add the button
04:10 - click event to our uh login button and
04:14 - on the basis of this button click event
04:17 - we are going to decide some action okay
04:21 - so let's uh take this button and create
04:25 - a button click event so login button Dot
04:29 - set onclick method or set on click
04:33 - listener and then we will create a
04:37 - new onclick
04:40 - listener and inside this onclick method
04:43 - we are going to write our code so first
04:46 - of all we want to check the text in the
04:49 - username and password so we will just uh
04:53 - write if the password so the we will get
04:57 - the text from the the username text
05:01 - field so
05:02 - username dot get text and then we will
05:08 - convert it to the string and then we
05:13 - will check if it's equal to some uh
05:16 - predefined username so dot
05:19 - equals and we will check if it's uh
05:23 - equal to a keyword for
05:27 - example user
05:30 - okay or uh you can uh predefine your own
05:35 - username right and we also want to check
05:38 - uh the password so we will uh give the
05:43 - end and we will check for the password
05:48 - also okay so inside this if we will add
05:51 - this and condition and then we will add
05:56 - for same for the password okay okay so
06:00 - I'm going to copy this code and paste it
06:02 - here and here we will check for for the
06:07 - password uh is equal to pass for example
06:11 - okay so what we are doing in this if
06:15 - condition we are taking the text from
06:17 - the user in the user text field and the
06:20 - password text field and we are matching
06:22 - if the user name entered is user and
06:26 - password entered is equal to this string
06:30 - called pass and then if it's uh true
06:35 - then what we are going to do is we are
06:38 - going to perform some action so let's
06:41 - perform some action we will just add a
06:58 - toast
07:01 - okay now this is for the condition where
07:06 - username and password is correct if the
07:08 - username and password is wrong here we
07:12 - can if the username and password is
07:13 - correct we can also redirect uh this
07:16 - activity to the second user this we will
07:19 - see in a moment but let's define the
07:22 - else condition for this first so
07:27 - else what we are going to do here is we
07:31 - are going to uh reduce the number of
07:34 - count right because uh we have defined
07:38 - maximum number of count is equal to five
07:40 - here right so we can uh you know reduce
07:44 - the number of count if the login is
07:48 - failed so what we are going to do is
07:50 - first of all we will uh show some
07:53 - message to the user that username and
07:57 - password is
07:59 - not correct and then what we are going
08:03 - to do is we can reduce the number of
08:07 - attempts so we can just reduce this
08:12 - counter by one so
08:16 - attempts minus minus this will attempts
08:19 - uh this will uh reduce the number of
08:22 - attempts by one and if the counter is
08:26 - zero we are going to disable
08:29 - if this
08:33 - counter is equal
08:35 - to 0 then what we are going to do is we
08:40 - are going to disable this login button
08:44 - so that user cannot login anymore do
08:52 - set enabled is equal to
08:56 - false Okay so so this is the uh
09:00 - condition we are going to write here if
09:03 - the username and password is correct we
09:06 - are going to show this message that
09:08 - username and password is correct
09:11 - otherwise if the username and password
09:13 - is not correct we are going to show this
09:15 - message that username and password is
09:16 - not correct and we are going to reduce
09:19 - this um counter by minus one and then we
09:25 - are going to uh you know if the counter
09:28 - is zero then we are going to disable
09:30 - this button right now uh we are going to
09:34 - call this method in our oncreate method
09:38 - so copy this method and uh paste it in
09:42 - oncreate and here I can see some error
09:46 - so I just want to change this edit text
09:50 - to text view because this text view uh
09:54 - for attempt count is a text view not uh
09:56 - edit text now we will add add the code
10:00 - to open the new activity when username
10:04 - and password is correct so if this
10:08 - username and password is correct below
10:10 - our message that username and password
10:13 - is correct we are going to uh create an
10:17 - instance of
10:19 - intent I or whatever name you want to
10:23 - give is equal to
10:26 - new intent and and as an argument we
10:30 - will pass the path to our second
10:34 - activity for the user so just open your
10:38 - Android manifest.xml file which we have
10:41 - addited last time and in here just see
10:46 - what name we have given here so just
10:49 - copy this name from here Android colon
10:51 - name is equal to whatever the name is
10:53 - this should start from com do example do
10:57 - whatever name you have given okay and in
11:00 - this login we will just uh in the intent
11:05 - instantiation we will just paste this
11:07 - path here okay so we have pasted this
11:11 - path and now we just want to start our
11:14 - activity okay using this intent
11:18 - so start activity and just uh pass this
11:24 - intent as an argument okay one more
11:27 - thing uh we want to do here is we want
11:31 - to set the count to attempt text box
11:36 - right so what we can do here is we can
11:41 - take this attempt inside this uh login
11:44 - method and just below the casting of
11:47 - these variable attempt dot set text and
11:53 - we will set text is equal to uh whatever
11:58 - is the count counter or current counter
12:00 - right now so this is our
12:03 - counter and we will convert this counter
12:06 - to text first okay so we will pass it
12:11 - like this integer
12:13 - dot then two
12:16 - text and then our counter here okay so
12:20 - now what you need to do is once you have
12:23 - uh you know uh printed your the number
12:26 - of attempt just copy this uh code from
12:29 - here and we also want to reduce the
12:32 - number of count and set this text to uh
12:35 - the attempt text box in the else
12:39 - condition so once if the username and
12:41 - password is correct or not correct we
12:44 - will reduce the counter and set the text
12:47 - to our attempt text box here right so
12:51 - just paste this uh here okay so this
12:56 - attempt. set text you paste it uh two
12:59 - times once uh at the starting after the
13:02 - casting of all the variables here and
13:05 - second after the reduction of this
13:08 - counter by one in the else condition now
13:11 - we are going to run our program so now
13:15 - our app is running and now we are going
13:19 - to enter username and password remember
13:22 - user name should be user and uh password
13:25 - should be passed in order to uh you know
13:28 - uh successful login right so we will
13:31 - enter first of all successful username
13:34 - and password or correct username and
13:38 - password and if the username and
13:42 - password is correctly entered when we
13:46 - press this login button you see it so
13:49 - shows this message username and password
13:51 - is correct and we are redirected to the
13:54 - next page now let's uh try to enter some
13:59 - random username and
14:01 - password and let's see the response okay
14:04 - so once uh we enter the you know random
14:09 - username and password and when we click
14:11 - this login button it reduces the
14:15 - attempts and it shows username and
14:17 - password is not correct once again
14:21 - username and password is not correct and
14:22 - it reduces the attempts once again once
14:26 - again and last time when we uh click
14:31 - login once the attempts becomes zero
14:35 - then this login button is no more active
14:39 - Okay so it's
14:41 - disabled so in this way you can make a
14:44 - simple login application using Android
14:46 - studio I hope you have enjoyed this
14:48 - video please wait comment and subscribe
14:50 - and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in the last video we have seen how to design a simple login app in Android Studio so we have completed in the last video the design part of our simple login app in this video we will see how to write the code behind uh this uh button or login button so that we can perform some actions uh or validate username and password and then perform some action on button click so let's get started now once we have uh completed our design now we will go to the Java folder here and in here we will go to the login. Java folder okay so we already designed our you know login page here so what you can do is you can can go to the login open login from here or directly go to the Java folder and in here go to login. Java folder okay and this is the Java code behind that login page activity right now in here we are going to uh declare some variables inside our login class and then we will add a button action perform uh method to our on create method so let's declare some variables we will declare two addit text boxes for username and password and we will declare one text view for attempt and one for button so let's uh do this so now we have uh declared all our variables I have uh declared one extra variable here which is called int ATT M counter so we want to provide minimum attempt or maximum attempt to the user so that uh you know for example we just want to provide five attempts to the user to uh try login and password and if these attempts are uh gone then we want to uh do some other option right so now our variables are declared and now we are ready to create our uh button click event so I will name my uh method as public void login button and in here we will just cast all these variables which we have declared here so we will cast a username password and uh the attempt and the button uh variable El so now we have casted all our four uh variables which we have declared here and now we are going to add the button click event to our uh login button and on the basis of this button click event we are going to decide some action okay so let's uh take this button and create a button click event so login button Dot set onclick method or set on click listener and then we will create a new onclick listener and inside this onclick method we are going to write our code so first of all we want to check the text in the username and password so we will just uh write if the password so the we will get the text from the the username text field so username dot get text and then we will convert it to the string and then we will check if it's equal to some uh predefined username so dot equals and we will check if it's uh equal to a keyword for example user okay or uh you can uh predefine your own username right and we also want to check uh the password so we will uh give the end and we will check for the password also okay so inside this if we will add this and condition and then we will add for same for the password okay okay so I'm going to copy this code and paste it here and here we will check for for the password uh is equal to pass for example okay so what we are doing in this if condition we are taking the text from the user in the user text field and the password text field and we are matching if the user name entered is user and password entered is equal to this string called pass and then if it's uh true then what we are going to do is we are going to perform some action so let's perform some action we will just add a toast okay now this is for the condition where username and password is correct if the username and password is wrong here we can if the username and password is correct we can also redirect uh this activity to the second user this we will see in a moment but let's define the else condition for this first so else what we are going to do here is we are going to uh reduce the number of count right because uh we have defined maximum number of count is equal to five here right so we can uh you know reduce the number of count if the login is failed so what we are going to do is first of all we will uh show some message to the user that username and password is not correct and then what we are going to do is we can reduce the number of attempts so we can just reduce this counter by one so attempts minus minus this will attempts uh this will uh reduce the number of attempts by one and if the counter is zero we are going to disable if this counter is equal to 0 then what we are going to do is we are going to disable this login button so that user cannot login anymore do set enabled is equal to false Okay so so this is the uh condition we are going to write here if the username and password is correct we are going to show this message that username and password is correct otherwise if the username and password is not correct we are going to show this message that username and password is not correct and we are going to reduce this um counter by minus one and then we are going to uh you know if the counter is zero then we are going to disable this button right now uh we are going to call this method in our oncreate method so copy this method and uh paste it in oncreate and here I can see some error so I just want to change this edit text to text view because this text view uh for attempt count is a text view not uh edit text now we will add add the code to open the new activity when username and password is correct so if this username and password is correct below our message that username and password is correct we are going to uh create an instance of intent I or whatever name you want to give is equal to new intent and and as an argument we will pass the path to our second activity for the user so just open your Android manifest.xml file which we have addited last time and in here just see what name we have given here so just copy this name from here Android colon name is equal to whatever the name is this should start from com do example do whatever name you have given okay and in this login we will just uh in the intent instantiation we will just paste this path here okay so we have pasted this path and now we just want to start our activity okay using this intent so start activity and just uh pass this intent as an argument okay one more thing uh we want to do here is we want to set the count to attempt text box right so what we can do here is we can take this attempt inside this uh login method and just below the casting of these variable attempt dot set text and we will set text is equal to uh whatever is the count counter or current counter right now so this is our counter and we will convert this counter to text first okay so we will pass it like this integer dot then two text and then our counter here okay so now what you need to do is once you have uh you know uh printed your the number of attempt just copy this uh code from here and we also want to reduce the number of count and set this text to uh the attempt text box in the else condition so once if the username and password is correct or not correct we will reduce the counter and set the text to our attempt text box here right so just paste this uh here okay so this attempt. set text you paste it uh two times once uh at the starting after the casting of all the variables here and second after the reduction of this counter by one in the else condition now we are going to run our program so now our app is running and now we are going to enter username and password remember user name should be user and uh password should be passed in order to uh you know uh successful login right so we will enter first of all successful username and password or correct username and password and if the username and password is correctly entered when we press this login button you see it so shows this message username and password is correct and we are redirected to the next page now let's uh try to enter some random username and password and let's see the response okay so once uh we enter the you know random username and password and when we click this login button it reduces the attempts and it shows username and password is not correct once again username and password is not correct and it reduces the attempts once again once again and last time when we uh click login once the attempts becomes zero then this login button is no more active Okay so it's disabled so in this way you can make a simple login application using Android studio I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
