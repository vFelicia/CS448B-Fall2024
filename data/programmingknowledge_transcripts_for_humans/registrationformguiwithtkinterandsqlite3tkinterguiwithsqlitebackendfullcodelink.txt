00:00 - hey everyone in this video we will try
00:03 - to make a registration form using
00:05 - thinker
00:06 - there is nothing to be explained about
00:08 - it as done in some of the last inter
00:10 - applications it is just assembling all
00:12 - that we have learned in Dinka this is
00:15 - more like a practice session so let's
00:17 - get started with the code right away
00:21 - from tenter import Star
00:23 - and also importing to
00:27 - Dot message box
00:31 - now I'll add my window root equals TK
00:37 - also I'll set a specific size of the
00:40 - window
00:41 - Let It Be 500 into 500.
00:44 - I will put that in inverted commas
00:47 - the form looks cleaner this way moreover
00:50 - it's been long we have used place to
00:52 - position objects mentioning the window
00:54 - size lets me manage coordinates easily
00:57 - then I'll also given a title I'll write
01:00 - shoot
01:01 - dot title
01:04 - registration form
01:07 - since we are making a registration form
01:09 - it would be registration form cool
01:14 - also let me give my form a little
01:16 - background so I'll write root dot config
01:20 - background equals
01:26 - hash f f
01:29 - e
01:30 - 6 f
01:33 - 0.
01:34 - now this should be an inverted commas
01:38 - also this is a light shade of pink
01:41 - you can also pick any random colors from
01:44 - Color Picker now
01:47 - I will make a very simple registration
01:49 - form it will have five entry Fields two
01:52 - for the complete name first and last
01:54 - name then a date of birth field a
01:57 - country field from which country the
01:59 - user belongs
02:00 - which will be a drop list along with
02:03 - selection checkbox
02:04 - and a radio button for gender selection
02:08 - okay
02:10 - so I'll just quickly declare all my five
02:13 - variables
02:15 - are string variables and if you cannot
02:18 - recall what string variables were they
02:21 - were usually used with the widgets entry
02:24 - and label since there are going to be
02:26 - many entries I would make use of string
02:29 - bar
02:30 - to manage them effectively I will not
02:33 - give in any arguments as they are
02:35 - directly contained in the master window
02:38 - so first name FN equals stringvar
02:42 - brackets
02:45 - last name Ln equals string bar again
02:51 - top the date of birth equals string bar
02:56 - variable equals string bar VAR
03:01 - or C1 equals Java this would be our
03:06 - checkbox one for the language selection
03:09 - word to
03:13 - equals python
03:15 - VAR C3 equals C plus plus
03:20 - and then radio variable again a string
03:24 - bar
03:27 - this war variable would be used for
03:30 - country
03:32 - and okay
03:34 - I would also like this information
03:38 - to be
03:39 - displayed later on the console after I
03:43 - have submitted the registration form
03:45 - so I'll have a function for that
03:48 - I'll write Def
03:50 - print
03:52 - entry
03:54 - rockets and column
03:59 - first equals FN
04:02 - dot get so first would be my first name
04:06 - variable
04:07 - you can take any variables that's not a
04:10 - problem
04:12 - and then for the last name I'll write
04:14 - second equals Ln dot get
04:20 - dob1 equals Tob dot get
04:25 - variable 1 equals variable dot get
04:31 - War 3 equals vrc1
04:35 - or 3 equals for C2
04:39 - War 3 equals or C3
04:45 - now these three were repeated because
04:48 - you would be selecting something from
04:51 - the check box only one option
04:54 - and accordingly the option would be fair
04:57 - in later on okay now I'll have my
05:00 - variable 4 equals radio underscore War
05:04 - dot get
05:07 - cool now I'll just print it
05:10 - so how I'll print it just follow along
05:12 - you know this already right print
05:16 - f
05:19 - the full name is
05:22 - first in curly braces and second in
05:25 - curly braces with a space in between
05:29 - then print f
05:33 - your age is
05:37 - top one
05:39 - and curly braces again and print
05:43 - if your country is
05:47 - in curly braces variable one
05:50 - then again print
05:53 - f
05:54 - your selected programming
05:57 - language is
06:04 - variable 3
06:06 - in curly braces again and print
06:10 - if your gender is in curly braces
06:14 - variable 4.
06:15 - now I'd be calling this function when
06:17 - I'd be done with my form filling so I'll
06:20 - also have this tincter Dot message box
06:23 - dot show info
06:25 - just to give the user a pop-up that your
06:28 - form has been filled
06:30 - so as the message I'll write
06:32 - congratulations
06:36 - this would be the heading of the pop-up
06:38 - box the message box
06:41 - and the message displayed in the Box
06:44 - would be user
06:47 - has
06:49 - successfully
06:52 - signed up
06:55 - now I'll start with the labels the text
06:58 - things and the entry fields so let's
07:02 - start with the heading I'll have a
07:04 - heading registration form
07:06 - so I'll have a variable heading equals
07:09 - label
07:13 - where do I want it I want it on root
07:16 - the window I have and text would be
07:21 - registration form
07:25 - let me decorate it a little so I'll
07:27 - write relief equals solid
07:31 - width equals twenty
07:36 - font
07:38 - area
07:40 - 19.
07:42 - and bold
07:44 - foreground is
07:47 - hash
07:48 - p30047
07:54 - and background is Hash FF
07:58 - e6f0
08:03 - now I'll place the heading heading dot
08:06 - place
08:07 - x equals 90 y equals 10.
08:13 - fine then for the first name I'll have a
08:16 - variable F name equals label
08:20 - it's just the text not the entry field
08:22 - right now so label and root
08:26 - text equals first name and column
08:30 - width equals 20 font equals bold 10
08:36 - background equals FF
08:39 - E6 F0
08:45 - fine now I'll place it
08:48 - fname dot place
08:53 - x equals 80.
08:58 - y equals 17.
09:01 - fine
09:03 - then for the entry field of the first
09:05 - name I'll write EF name
09:08 - equals entry
09:12 - root
09:14 - text War equals FN
09:18 - okay
09:20 - now FN was the string variable that we
09:22 - declared above I hope you remember this
09:25 - is how we have used it
09:27 - and I'll place it I need to place the
09:30 - entry field also so it should be on the
09:32 - same y-axis
09:34 - and so I'll write EF name dot place
09:39 - x equals 240 y equals 70. now very
09:45 - similarly for the last name L name
09:49 - equals label
09:51 - root
09:53 - text equals last name Colin
09:59 - width equals 20
10:02 - font equals bold then
10:05 - background equals again
10:08 - hash f f e 6 F 0
10:14 - so I'll place it
10:16 - lname dot Place x equals 80 y equals
10:22 - 120.
10:25 - now the entry field for the last name
10:28 - I'll just copy it from above and change
10:32 - the text bar
10:34 - equals Ln
10:36 - then I'll pack it again I'll just copy
10:40 - it
10:41 - the last entry field
10:43 - x axis would be same y coordinate would
10:47 - be 120 now
10:49 - fine then moving on to the date of birth
10:53 - label and entry I'll have date equals
10:57 - label
10:59 - root comma text equals top
11:04 - width equals 20
11:06 - font equals bold and then background
11:10 - again would be ffe6 F0
11:14 - and I'll place this I'll write date dot
11:18 - place
11:19 - x equals 80.
11:22 - y equals 170.
11:26 - fine then the entry field
11:29 - edob equals entry
11:33 - root
11:36 - and text bar equals top
11:41 - now I'll place it e t o p dot Place x
11:45 - equals 240 y equals 170. fine
11:51 - now I'll have the country and that would
11:54 - be your drop down list so first the
11:57 - label country equals label
12:03 - where do I want this I want it on the
12:05 - windows so I'll write root
12:08 - so the text would be country of course
12:11 - text equals country
12:15 - width equals 20 font equals poles 10
12:20 - for round equals ffe6 F0
12:24 - you can just copy it from above
12:27 - and change the text part
12:29 - and
12:32 - country dot place
12:35 - x equals 75 y equals to 20.
12:44 - now I'll given a list for the drop down
12:47 - box
12:48 - and let's have it let's have the list
12:51 - now
12:52 - list equals
12:56 - let me give in some names of country
12:59 - Nepal
13:01 - India
13:04 - America
13:06 - China
13:09 - doll
13:11 - Japan
13:13 - South Africa
13:18 - and you can given names of any countries
13:21 - and a lot more countries
13:25 - and I'll just make it a drop down list
13:28 - now how do we do it so drop list equals
13:31 - option menu
13:34 - it's again a printer function
13:37 - and root
13:40 - and variable
13:43 - variable would save the value of the
13:46 - list whatever was selected
13:49 - and where the values will be selected
13:52 - from the list so star list
13:57 - fine now to set the value I'll write VAR
14:01 - dot set select country
14:05 - okay
14:07 - now drop list dot config
14:11 - since the drop list values that is war
14:14 - can change so I need to configure the
14:16 - drop list
14:18 - and I'll just give in the width equals
14:21 - 15.
14:26 - so I'll just place it drop list dot
14:30 - place
14:31 - x equals 238 y equals to 20.
14:37 - now again I'll have a label for the
14:39 - language
14:42 - equals label
14:45 - root
14:47 - text equals programming language
14:52 - width equals 20 font bold and 10.
14:56 - background same as above ffe6f0
15:01 - and I'll place this variable language
15:04 - language dot place
15:09 - x equals 95
15:11 - and Y equals to 70.
15:15 - fine
15:17 - now I'll have the check buttons
15:20 - C1 equals check button
15:23 - root
15:26 - text equals Java
15:29 - variable equals War C1
15:33 - dot place
15:35 - now here I'll be placing this all
15:39 - together
15:40 - without taking it separately
15:43 - and x equals 235
15:46 - y equals to 70.
15:50 - just copy this entire statement twice
15:53 - because we have two more check buttons
15:56 - text would be python for the second one
15:59 - C2 and where variable would be VAR C2
16:04 - and I'll place it somewhere else that is
16:07 - x equals to nine t
16:09 - and Y equals to 70.
16:12 - similarly
16:15 - for C plus plus
16:20 - VAR C3
16:22 - and I'll change the x coordinates also
16:27 - fine now for the gender I'll have the
16:30 - label
16:31 - I'll just copy it from above
16:34 - because everything is same just need to
16:37 - change the text that is gender
16:41 - otherwise width font and background
16:45 - color they all are same
16:47 - and I'll place it somewhere else I'll
16:50 - write gender dot place
16:52 - x equals 73
16:55 - y equals 320. fine
17:00 - now for gender I'll have radio buttons
17:03 - I can have male and female
17:06 - so R1 equals radio button
17:10 - root
17:12 - text equals mail
17:16 - variable equals radio underscore War
17:20 - value equals mail dot place
17:25 - x equals 230 comma y equals 320.
17:31 - copy the same R1 make it R2 and text
17:36 - would be female
17:38 - also the value would change to female
17:43 - and x coordinate would change to 290.
17:48 - fine
17:49 - so I had all my five entries
17:53 - and I'll have two buttons now one to
17:55 - quit
17:57 - and another for submitting the form so
18:00 - I'll have
18:01 - submit equals button
18:06 - root
18:07 - text equals submit
18:10 - width equals 12.
18:13 - background equals FF 4D 9 4
18:21 - ground let be white
18:23 - command equals print entry
18:27 - and I'll place it
18:29 - x equals 130
18:32 - y equals 400.
18:35 - I'll have
18:36 - the quit button so quit equals button
18:42 - root
18:43 - comma text equals quit
18:47 - width equals 12.
18:53 - background and foreground same as buff
18:56 - and command would be exit
19:00 - and I'll place it
19:02 - x equals to 80 comma y equals 400.
19:08 - and I'll call in the main Loop to root
19:11 - root dot main Loop it's good to go now
19:15 - we should not have any problem in the
19:18 - code let's run this uncheck it
19:25 - so I have the window the registration
19:27 - form
19:28 - I'll just quickly fill in some details
19:32 - you can see the labels and the entry
19:34 - fields for the first name I can fill in
19:38 - person one
19:42 - for last name I can fill in
19:45 - last name
19:50 - date of birth can be 12.
19:53 - 04 slash two zero zero one
19:58 - I can select some country see there's a
20:01 - drop list
20:02 - and let me select Canada
20:05 - programming language Let It Be python
20:09 - gender I'll click on mail
20:12 - and I'll submit
20:15 - so I have this
20:17 - pop-up box message box congratulations
20:20 - user has successfully signed up when I
20:23 - click on submit I have this printed on
20:26 - the console
20:28 - so this was it about the program
20:31 - hey everyone in the last video we made a
20:34 - form a registration form that was very
20:36 - basic and the information attained from
20:38 - it was just printed on the console now
20:41 - in this video we will get that into a
20:43 - data in a table in a database we will
20:46 - save the information and table so for
20:49 - that we have the SQL Lite model to carry
20:52 - out data related function
20:55 - now the entire program would be same
20:57 - except the print entry function let me
21:00 - copy the program I'll go to registration
21:02 - firm.pui
21:04 - control a control C and I'll just paste
21:08 - it over here Ctrl V
21:11 - INE
21:12 - now I'll import
21:15 - sqlite3 and if you don't have the module
21:18 - you can always download it using the
21:20 - command pip install SQL lite3
21:24 - so I'll write import
21:27 - SQL
21:29 - 8 3.
21:31 - fine
21:33 - and I'll just delete this function Dev
21:37 - print entry and in place I'll write def
21:39 - database
21:41 - I will get the variables so I'll write
21:43 - first just like print entry
21:46 - I'll write first equals FN dot get
21:55 - second
21:57 - equals
21:59 - Ln
22:00 - dot get last name the first name is done
22:03 - then dob1
22:06 - equals dob the date of birth dot get
22:09 - then variable one var1 equals War dot
22:14 - get
22:15 - this was for the country
22:17 - then
22:19 - variable 3
22:21 - bar 3 equals War underscore C1
22:27 - or 3 equals
22:30 - VAR underscore C2
22:34 - bar 3 equals War underscore C3
22:40 - fine then the radio button
22:43 - War 4 for the gender equals radio
22:48 - underscore or
22:50 - dot get
22:52 - now till here the program was same as
22:56 - the print entry function
22:58 - it changes when I start connecting this
23:01 - data
23:03 - with the table or the database now how
23:06 - do we do that I'll write I'll have a
23:08 - variable
23:09 - c-o-n-n that is for connection equals
23:13 - SQL light 3 dot connect
23:18 - and in Brackets I'll given the name of
23:21 - the database okay so I'll write form dot
23:23 - DB
23:25 - this is to establish a connection to
23:28 - sqlite you need to pass the database
23:30 - name you want to connect okay that was
23:33 - form dot DB
23:35 - if the specified database is not present
23:37 - on the disk then a new one would be
23:40 - created by sqlite otherwise it will
23:42 - connect to the one that is already
23:45 - present
23:46 - now if there is a connection established
23:49 - that was done by dot connect I'll write
23:52 - with con Conn
23:56 - cursor equals con dot cursor now this is
24:00 - another function by sqlite to create a
24:04 - cursor object to execute SQL light
24:06 - commands queries from python okay
24:08 - Now to create a database to add values
24:11 - to it SQL commands need to be executed
24:14 - and since we are doing that in a python
24:16 - file I need the cursor object okay now
24:19 - I'll write cursor.execute
24:24 - and in inverted commas I'll given the
24:27 - SQL command Okay so execute is used to
24:31 - run the SQL query and return the results
24:33 - okay
24:37 - so
24:39 - create table
24:42 - if not exists
24:46 - student
24:48 - which is the name of the database or the
24:50 - table
24:51 - SQL commands are not case sensitive
24:54 - but they are preferred to be written in
24:56 - uppercase
24:58 - then brackets
25:00 - are given the field names F name
25:04 - and what type of Entry would be made it
25:07 - would be text
25:09 - and then L name
25:13 - and also text
25:16 - DOB
25:17 - it is a date so I'll write date
25:20 - and Country
25:24 - text again
25:25 - programming language I'll write proc
25:28 - language
25:30 - it is also text
25:33 - and gender
25:35 - which is also text
25:37 - enclosed brackets and the inverted
25:39 - commas
25:41 - again I'll have another statement SQL
25:44 - statement I'll write cursor.execute
25:49 - in inverted commas
25:55 - insert into
25:59 - student
26:05 - F name
26:07 - L name
26:09 - dop country
26:11 - Pro language
26:15 - gender
26:17 - and what values would be inserted
26:20 - values
26:22 - Rockets I'll give in six question marks
26:26 - for six fields
26:31 - inverted commas close
26:36 - and
26:37 - comma the value of these question marks
26:41 - can be first
26:43 - these variables
26:45 - where we get the value of the string
26:48 - words first second
26:50 - dob1 War 1 War 3
26:55 - and War 4.
26:57 - fine
26:58 - these were just the two SQL statements
27:01 - that I needed and then I'll commit I'll
27:04 - write c o n n dot commit
27:09 - and buckets to make changes to the table
27:12 - to confirm the change is committed okay
27:14 - and also I need a pop-up box after I
27:17 - have submitted the form so I'll write
27:19 - tincter
27:21 - Dot message
27:22 - box
27:25 - dot show info
27:28 - uh we can print in the same message
27:30 - congratulations
27:35 - and for the information the user has
27:39 - successfully
27:42 - signed
27:46 - close and what it comes closed
27:49 - and the rest would be pretty similar
27:53 - we have all the entries we have the
27:55 - labels we have the entries
27:57 - we have the drop list for the country
27:59 - then we have the check buttons
28:02 - the radio buttons
28:04 - but here for the command of the submit
28:07 - button I'll change this to database
28:10 - instead of print entry
28:14 - and the rest can remain the same
28:17 - now let's run this let's fill in the
28:20 - form
28:21 - and then we'll check the database
28:24 - so I have my form now I'll fill in this
28:27 - registration form twice just to have
28:30 - some data when I'm checking the database
28:32 - the table
28:33 - so for first name I can write
28:36 - ABC
28:39 - and for last name I can write x y z
28:43 - then for the date of words 12 0 3 slash
28:48 - two zero zero three
28:50 - I'll select some country India
28:52 - programming language Let It Be Python
28:55 - and gender mail and I'll submit I have
28:59 - the pop-up box and I'll click on OK
29:02 - and I'll quit again I'll run this
29:11 - we can given the first name mnop
29:15 - last name
29:18 - qrst
29:21 - dob can be
29:24 - 10 slash 10 slash 1980
29:30 - and I'll select the country
29:32 - Canada again maybe and programming log
29:36 - which can be Java female and I'll submit
29:40 - I have the pop-up box
29:42 - and I'll quit
29:44 - now it's time to check the database
29:47 - for that you need to download something
29:49 - and that's database for sqlite
29:52 - you can just search the same statement
29:55 - database for sqlite and you'll find this
29:58 - first link
29:59 - and when you click on it you will see
30:01 - downloads and you can download the
30:04 - required version
30:06 - so I installed the standard installer
30:08 - for 64-bit windows
30:11 - now once you've installed it installing
30:13 - this is very easy you can go with the
30:15 - default settings and you just need to
30:18 - check the Tinker folder in which you are
30:20 - saving all the programs and there you'll
30:23 - find this form.tb and you can open it
30:26 - with database for SQL
30:29 - and you can actually see the table
30:32 - you will find this interface
30:36 - so you can see we have our table student
30:40 - it has the specified field names when I
30:43 - click on browse data you can actually
30:45 - see the table that we have filled in
30:48 - so this was all about the program we
30:51 - learned how to use sqlite3 along with
30:54 - printer
30:55 - and SQL in Python
30:58 - I hope you understood what we did thank
31:01 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone in this video we will try to make a registration form using thinker there is nothing to be explained about it as done in some of the last inter applications it is just assembling all that we have learned in Dinka this is more like a practice session so let's get started with the code right away from tenter import Star and also importing to Dot message box now I'll add my window root equals TK also I'll set a specific size of the window Let It Be 500 into 500. I will put that in inverted commas the form looks cleaner this way moreover it's been long we have used place to position objects mentioning the window size lets me manage coordinates easily then I'll also given a title I'll write shoot dot title registration form since we are making a registration form it would be registration form cool also let me give my form a little background so I'll write root dot config background equals hash f f e 6 f 0. now this should be an inverted commas also this is a light shade of pink you can also pick any random colors from Color Picker now I will make a very simple registration form it will have five entry Fields two for the complete name first and last name then a date of birth field a country field from which country the user belongs which will be a drop list along with selection checkbox and a radio button for gender selection okay so I'll just quickly declare all my five variables are string variables and if you cannot recall what string variables were they were usually used with the widgets entry and label since there are going to be many entries I would make use of string bar to manage them effectively I will not give in any arguments as they are directly contained in the master window so first name FN equals stringvar brackets last name Ln equals string bar again top the date of birth equals string bar variable equals string bar VAR or C1 equals Java this would be our checkbox one for the language selection word to equals python VAR C3 equals C plus plus and then radio variable again a string bar this war variable would be used for country and okay I would also like this information to be displayed later on the console after I have submitted the registration form so I'll have a function for that I'll write Def print entry rockets and column first equals FN dot get so first would be my first name variable you can take any variables that's not a problem and then for the last name I'll write second equals Ln dot get dob1 equals Tob dot get variable 1 equals variable dot get War 3 equals vrc1 or 3 equals for C2 War 3 equals or C3 now these three were repeated because you would be selecting something from the check box only one option and accordingly the option would be fair in later on okay now I'll have my variable 4 equals radio underscore War dot get cool now I'll just print it so how I'll print it just follow along you know this already right print f the full name is first in curly braces and second in curly braces with a space in between then print f your age is top one and curly braces again and print if your country is in curly braces variable one then again print f your selected programming language is variable 3 in curly braces again and print if your gender is in curly braces variable 4. now I'd be calling this function when I'd be done with my form filling so I'll also have this tincter Dot message box dot show info just to give the user a popup that your form has been filled so as the message I'll write congratulations this would be the heading of the popup box the message box and the message displayed in the Box would be user has successfully signed up now I'll start with the labels the text things and the entry fields so let's start with the heading I'll have a heading registration form so I'll have a variable heading equals label where do I want it I want it on root the window I have and text would be registration form let me decorate it a little so I'll write relief equals solid width equals twenty font area 19. and bold foreground is hash p30047 and background is Hash FF e6f0 now I'll place the heading heading dot place x equals 90 y equals 10. fine then for the first name I'll have a variable F name equals label it's just the text not the entry field right now so label and root text equals first name and column width equals 20 font equals bold 10 background equals FF E6 F0 fine now I'll place it fname dot place x equals 80. y equals 17. fine then for the entry field of the first name I'll write EF name equals entry root text War equals FN okay now FN was the string variable that we declared above I hope you remember this is how we have used it and I'll place it I need to place the entry field also so it should be on the same yaxis and so I'll write EF name dot place x equals 240 y equals 70. now very similarly for the last name L name equals label root text equals last name Colin width equals 20 font equals bold then background equals again hash f f e 6 F 0 so I'll place it lname dot Place x equals 80 y equals 120. now the entry field for the last name I'll just copy it from above and change the text bar equals Ln then I'll pack it again I'll just copy it the last entry field x axis would be same y coordinate would be 120 now fine then moving on to the date of birth label and entry I'll have date equals label root comma text equals top width equals 20 font equals bold and then background again would be ffe6 F0 and I'll place this I'll write date dot place x equals 80. y equals 170. fine then the entry field edob equals entry root and text bar equals top now I'll place it e t o p dot Place x equals 240 y equals 170. fine now I'll have the country and that would be your drop down list so first the label country equals label where do I want this I want it on the windows so I'll write root so the text would be country of course text equals country width equals 20 font equals poles 10 for round equals ffe6 F0 you can just copy it from above and change the text part and country dot place x equals 75 y equals to 20. now I'll given a list for the drop down box and let's have it let's have the list now list equals let me give in some names of country Nepal India America China doll Japan South Africa and you can given names of any countries and a lot more countries and I'll just make it a drop down list now how do we do it so drop list equals option menu it's again a printer function and root and variable variable would save the value of the list whatever was selected and where the values will be selected from the list so star list fine now to set the value I'll write VAR dot set select country okay now drop list dot config since the drop list values that is war can change so I need to configure the drop list and I'll just give in the width equals 15. so I'll just place it drop list dot place x equals 238 y equals to 20. now again I'll have a label for the language equals label root text equals programming language width equals 20 font bold and 10. background same as above ffe6f0 and I'll place this variable language language dot place x equals 95 and Y equals to 70. fine now I'll have the check buttons C1 equals check button root text equals Java variable equals War C1 dot place now here I'll be placing this all together without taking it separately and x equals 235 y equals to 70. just copy this entire statement twice because we have two more check buttons text would be python for the second one C2 and where variable would be VAR C2 and I'll place it somewhere else that is x equals to nine t and Y equals to 70. similarly for C plus plus VAR C3 and I'll change the x coordinates also fine now for the gender I'll have the label I'll just copy it from above because everything is same just need to change the text that is gender otherwise width font and background color they all are same and I'll place it somewhere else I'll write gender dot place x equals 73 y equals 320. fine now for gender I'll have radio buttons I can have male and female so R1 equals radio button root text equals mail variable equals radio underscore War value equals mail dot place x equals 230 comma y equals 320. copy the same R1 make it R2 and text would be female also the value would change to female and x coordinate would change to 290. fine so I had all my five entries and I'll have two buttons now one to quit and another for submitting the form so I'll have submit equals button root text equals submit width equals 12. background equals FF 4D 9 4 ground let be white command equals print entry and I'll place it x equals 130 y equals 400. I'll have the quit button so quit equals button root comma text equals quit width equals 12. background and foreground same as buff and command would be exit and I'll place it x equals to 80 comma y equals 400. and I'll call in the main Loop to root root dot main Loop it's good to go now we should not have any problem in the code let's run this uncheck it so I have the window the registration form I'll just quickly fill in some details you can see the labels and the entry fields for the first name I can fill in person one for last name I can fill in last name date of birth can be 12. 04 slash two zero zero one I can select some country see there's a drop list and let me select Canada programming language Let It Be python gender I'll click on mail and I'll submit so I have this popup box message box congratulations user has successfully signed up when I click on submit I have this printed on the console so this was it about the program hey everyone in the last video we made a form a registration form that was very basic and the information attained from it was just printed on the console now in this video we will get that into a data in a table in a database we will save the information and table so for that we have the SQL Lite model to carry out data related function now the entire program would be same except the print entry function let me copy the program I'll go to registration firm.pui control a control C and I'll just paste it over here Ctrl V INE now I'll import sqlite3 and if you don't have the module you can always download it using the command pip install SQL lite3 so I'll write import SQL 8 3. fine and I'll just delete this function Dev print entry and in place I'll write def database I will get the variables so I'll write first just like print entry I'll write first equals FN dot get second equals Ln dot get last name the first name is done then dob1 equals dob the date of birth dot get then variable one var1 equals War dot get this was for the country then variable 3 bar 3 equals War underscore C1 or 3 equals VAR underscore C2 bar 3 equals War underscore C3 fine then the radio button War 4 for the gender equals radio underscore or dot get now till here the program was same as the print entry function it changes when I start connecting this data with the table or the database now how do we do that I'll write I'll have a variable conn that is for connection equals SQL light 3 dot connect and in Brackets I'll given the name of the database okay so I'll write form dot DB this is to establish a connection to sqlite you need to pass the database name you want to connect okay that was form dot DB if the specified database is not present on the disk then a new one would be created by sqlite otherwise it will connect to the one that is already present now if there is a connection established that was done by dot connect I'll write with con Conn cursor equals con dot cursor now this is another function by sqlite to create a cursor object to execute SQL light commands queries from python okay Now to create a database to add values to it SQL commands need to be executed and since we are doing that in a python file I need the cursor object okay now I'll write cursor.execute and in inverted commas I'll given the SQL command Okay so execute is used to run the SQL query and return the results okay so create table if not exists student which is the name of the database or the table SQL commands are not case sensitive but they are preferred to be written in uppercase then brackets are given the field names F name and what type of Entry would be made it would be text and then L name and also text DOB it is a date so I'll write date and Country text again programming language I'll write proc language it is also text and gender which is also text enclosed brackets and the inverted commas again I'll have another statement SQL statement I'll write cursor.execute in inverted commas insert into student F name L name dop country Pro language gender and what values would be inserted values Rockets I'll give in six question marks for six fields inverted commas close and comma the value of these question marks can be first these variables where we get the value of the string words first second dob1 War 1 War 3 and War 4. fine these were just the two SQL statements that I needed and then I'll commit I'll write c o n n dot commit and buckets to make changes to the table to confirm the change is committed okay and also I need a popup box after I have submitted the form so I'll write tincter Dot message box dot show info uh we can print in the same message congratulations and for the information the user has successfully signed close and what it comes closed and the rest would be pretty similar we have all the entries we have the labels we have the entries we have the drop list for the country then we have the check buttons the radio buttons but here for the command of the submit button I'll change this to database instead of print entry and the rest can remain the same now let's run this let's fill in the form and then we'll check the database so I have my form now I'll fill in this registration form twice just to have some data when I'm checking the database the table so for first name I can write ABC and for last name I can write x y z then for the date of words 12 0 3 slash two zero zero three I'll select some country India programming language Let It Be Python and gender mail and I'll submit I have the popup box and I'll click on OK and I'll quit again I'll run this we can given the first name mnop last name qrst dob can be 10 slash 10 slash 1980 and I'll select the country Canada again maybe and programming log which can be Java female and I'll submit I have the popup box and I'll quit now it's time to check the database for that you need to download something and that's database for sqlite you can just search the same statement database for sqlite and you'll find this first link and when you click on it you will see downloads and you can download the required version so I installed the standard installer for 64bit windows now once you've installed it installing this is very easy you can go with the default settings and you just need to check the Tinker folder in which you are saving all the programs and there you'll find this form.tb and you can open it with database for SQL and you can actually see the table you will find this interface so you can see we have our table student it has the specified field names when I click on browse data you can actually see the table that we have filled in so this was all about the program we learned how to use sqlite3 along with printer and SQL in Python I hope you understood what we did thank you
