00:00 - now in this video we will cover the zip
00:02 - command okay
00:03 - so basically uh as you are aware of zip
00:06 - like we chip files to compress the size
00:08 - of that particular directory or a
00:09 - particular file which we use
00:11 - okay suppose you want to transfer a file
00:13 - of 500 me to your friend okay but
00:18 - you want to compress that file and after
00:20 - that you want to send it to that your
00:22 - friend so
00:23 - when you zip that file so the size will
00:25 - be automatically decrease okay
00:28 - so that's why we use the zip command so
00:29 - basically in the linux we will use the
00:31 - zip command okay for uh
00:34 - zipping the files and directories okay
00:36 - but in
00:38 - windows or you use uh that particular
00:41 - gui to
00:42 - zip the files okay so now in this video
00:44 - what we are going to do
00:46 - we will first of all create a one
00:47 - directory
00:50 - mkdi zip and let's move into this
00:52 - directory
00:54 - and also maybe zip has been created yes
00:56 - here it is now what we will do
00:58 - i will create multiple files
01:00 - uh
01:02 - one.xt
01:06 - 2.txt3.txt okay
01:08 - so basically on in a simple way how you
01:10 - can zip file without any option so this
01:12 - is a just simple like you zip and the
01:15 - file name which you want to give to that
01:17 - particular
01:19 - zip file so i am giving it the file dot
01:22 - zip and the particular files which you
01:24 - want to
01:27 - which you want to
01:30 - add in that particular
01:32 - zip file okay
01:34 - so now what we can do i will just hit
01:37 - enter
01:38 - and here you can see file.zip has been
01:40 - created now in this
01:41 - particular
01:43 - zip file you can see one dot txt has
01:45 - been added okay
01:46 - so but what if you want to add multiple
01:50 - files okay
01:51 - if you want to add multi multiple files
01:54 - in your that particular
01:56 - this zipper so how you can do it so for
01:59 - this what you will do i am i'm going to
02:01 - create another
02:03 - zip file with file two dot step
02:06 - one dot txt
02:08 - two dot txt
02:10 - three dot txt
02:12 - and
02:13 - again here you can see file two dot zip
02:15 - in this we will get uh
02:17 - actually three files okay one two three
02:19 - dot txt we are getting here
02:21 - so this is the way of zipping multiple
02:24 - files together okay
02:26 - in a particular zip file in which you
02:29 - want so now what we are going to do i am
02:31 - again going to create some more files
02:35 - touch 4.60
02:37 - 5.60
02:39 - 6.txt okay
02:42 - so now what i want to do i am going to
02:44 - zip
02:46 - four dot txt and file3.zip file
02:51 - okay
02:52 - so the option is one of the option of
02:55 - the zip command is hyphen you option
02:57 - which we can use to like
03:00 - add some other files in that particular
03:03 - zip file
03:04 - it means
03:05 - like
03:06 - in the file 3.0 right now we have only
03:09 - four dot txt okay so what i'm going to
03:12 - do i will add five and six also without
03:16 - ampering four so the there is a hyphen
03:19 - new option in the zip command
03:22 - okay
03:23 - which we can use to
03:26 - perform that particular action so i'm
03:28 - going to add here five dot txt and also
03:31 - six dot txt
03:33 - and now i will open up
03:35 - this zip file and here you can see four
03:37 - five six has been added okay
03:39 - so we will cover unzip in next video and
03:42 - that's why i'm going i'm showing you
03:43 - like this okay that's why i'm not
03:45 - unzipping it with cmd okay
03:48 - so in this way you can add uh other
03:50 - files also
03:52 - and one more option is there like uh
03:54 - hyphen m option so what it does it's
03:57 - basically like it will zip the file and
04:00 - it will also delete that particular file
04:02 - sometimes in case you don't want to uh
04:05 - like uh
04:07 - what we can say keep that particular
04:09 - file okay in your disk or to save your
04:12 - space or something like that you can
04:13 - think of it so how we can do it uh like
04:15 - here is ls we i'm going to do
04:18 - and here is a six dot till one two six
04:21 - or text is file now what i'm going to do
04:23 - zip hyphen m
04:25 - i will
04:26 - [Music]
04:27 - use five four dots
04:30 - and i will add a suppose
04:32 - four dot txt five dot six dot txt
04:36 - hit enter adding all those things and
04:39 - here you can see all the four to six dot
04:41 - txt file has been
04:43 - deleted and here in the file for dot j
04:45 - we will get the
04:46 - four five six dot txt files so using
04:50 - hyphen we you can uh
04:52 - like uh
04:53 - zip that all files and also
04:56 - uh you can delete that files to save
04:58 - your space amateurs you will not need to
05:00 - delete that file after
05:02 - the zipping of all that things okay
05:04 - so now moving forward what we can do so
05:07 - uh suppose if you have other directories
05:09 - also like
05:11 - with 30 xt files you have some other
05:12 - directory so how you can do it how you
05:14 - can zip that also
05:16 - so you can
05:17 - do that in a recursive manner like using
05:20 - iphone or option so first of all what
05:22 - i'm going to do i will just create some
05:24 - other
05:25 - directories like let's create test
05:27 - okay
05:29 - i have created test directory
05:31 - and you have to
05:33 - like
05:36 - what you can say
05:37 - you have to add one to three dot txt
05:39 - files also and also test
05:42 - uh directory in one zip file how you can
05:45 - do it you have to just use hyphen r
05:47 - option so hyphen are option what it does
05:50 - it they basically work as a recursive
05:52 - manner like it will uh
05:54 - zip your directory
05:56 - and also files which you you will use so
05:59 - let's uh
06:01 - give it a name as dir dot zip and then
06:04 - what we can do one dot txt two dot txt
06:08 - three dot txt and the name of the
06:11 - file
06:12 - not file directory
06:15 - enter
06:16 - and
06:18 - where it is cdi.zip
06:22 - and here you can see all of your files
06:24 - has been added into that particular
06:28 - zip file okay
06:30 - so in this way you can
06:32 - uh add some other like more than files
06:35 - and directories in one zip file using a
06:36 - single command or using iphone or option
06:39 - mostly it happens mostly we use it in
06:42 - like uh
06:43 - in our windows system
06:45 - like we have multiple files in one
06:48 - directory is also some other directory
06:49 - so you can basically like use it in this
06:52 - case and one more important thing though
06:55 - and the last one the last option which
06:57 - we will see together is hyphen e option
06:59 - okay it basically stands for encrypt so
07:02 - what it does
07:03 - uh
07:05 - well let me
07:07 - like what i will do i will add this
07:09 - one.txt file into one zip file with a
07:12 - password okay basically it will create a
07:16 - zip file with an password so how you can
07:18 - do it zip
07:19 - i will
07:20 - write password
07:23 - dot sep
07:25 - into
07:26 - one dot txt
07:28 - like one dot text i want to zip into
07:30 - this particular
07:31 - file password dot
07:33 - zip i will use hyphen e option
07:36 - and here it will ask for me to enter the
07:39 - password which you want
07:40 - i will use
07:42 - something okay
07:44 - i use and here you can see adding
07:46 - one.txt is stored in that particular zip
07:48 - file so where it is on this one
07:50 - password.js
07:52 - okay
07:54 - let me open it
07:58 - yeah and now here one dot txt and like
08:00 - as you can see here clock type also like
08:03 - it will may like prompt me to enter the
08:06 - password now i will enter
08:11 - and there you can see one dot txt has
08:13 - been unlocked as there is nothing so
08:14 - it's showing like nothing here okay we
08:17 - are not written anything in that one.txt
08:19 - file
08:20 - okay
08:21 - so uh that's all for today uh i hope you
08:23 - got it how you can zip files and also
08:27 - how you can save multiple files together
08:28 - in a single uh file with a hyphen e
08:31 - option like if you want
08:33 - to like protect
08:35 - or zip some sensitive files and you have
08:37 - to send it to some other person you
08:39 - don't want to disclose that particular
08:40 - file so you can easily use hyphen option
08:42 - also in that case
08:44 - so that's all for

hyphen e option and here it will ask for me to enter the password which you want i will use something okay i use and here you can see adding one.txt is stored in that particular zip file so where it is on this one password.js okay let me open it yeah and now here one dot txt and like as you can see here clock type also like it will may like prompt me to enter the password now i will enter and there you can see one dot txt has been unlocked as there is nothing so it's showing like nothing here okay we are not written anything in that one.txt file okay so uh that's all for today uh i hope you got it how you can zip files and also how you can save multiple files together in a single uh file with a hyphen e option like if you want to like protect or zip some sensitive files and you have to send it to some other person you don't want to disclose that particular file so you can easily use hyphen option also in that case so that's all for
