00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video I have shown you how to
00:05 - install Linux Mint on your VMware Player
00:10 - and after installing Linux Mint on your
00:12 - VMware Player the first thing you want
00:15 - to do is go into the full screen mode so
00:19 - let's try to go into the full screen
00:21 - mode just after installing the Linux
00:24 - Mint one would say just click this
00:27 - maximize button and it will go into the
00:30 - full screen mode but you can see here
00:32 - it's not going into the full screen mode
00:35 - so maybe let's try this uh enter full
00:40 - screen mode and this will help and once
00:43 - you click this and this will also not
00:46 - help and the other option maybe one can
00:50 - try is maybe we can stretch
00:55 - this uh VMware screen from here and this
00:59 - doesn't help either so in this video I
01:02 - will show you how to uh uh make your
01:06 - Linux Mint screen to go into the full
01:10 - screen mode so for that we need to
01:13 - install VMware tools so what you need to
01:17 - do is first just go to this ler combo
01:22 - box at the top and go to manage and just
01:26 - click this install VMware tools so I
01:30 - click
01:32 - it and once you click this install
01:35 - VMware tools it will show at the bottom
01:39 - if you can see here it will show some
01:42 - help tab here and it's showing that make
01:45 - sure that you are logged in as a super
01:48 - user and your CD is mounted and yeah
01:54 - this is something uh help tip to you to
01:58 - use VM player and how to install them
02:02 - and in the meantime you will see here
02:06 - VMware tool will be mounted here as a
02:09 - DVD and you will be able to see this U
02:13 - VMware tools automatically here so first
02:16 - thing you need to do is extract this ZIP
02:20 - file somewhere so just double click
02:27 - it
02:28 - and
02:32 - just click this extract button from
02:36 - here and you need to provide the
02:38 - location wherever you want to extract
02:42 - this so for example I want to extract
02:44 - this in my downloads folder so just
02:47 - click this download folder and I click
02:52 - extract and it will extract this VMware
02:55 - tools and whatever is the version of
02:59 - this tools it will extract this into my
03:03 - download
03:05 - folder so I will wait while it's
03:09 - extracting and let's see in our download
03:15 - folder whether it's there or not so I
03:19 - will go to my download
03:28 - folder
03:31 - and you can see it's
03:39 - here so once the extraction is complete
03:42 - you will be able to see this uh quit or
