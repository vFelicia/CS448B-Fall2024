00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Jenkins tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:06 - Jenkins CLI and more specifically I'm
00:10 - going to show you how you can run your
00:13 - Jenkins job using Jenkins CLI so let's
00:18 - get started
00:19 - so first of all what I'm going to do is
00:20 - I'm going to just click on manage
00:22 - Jenkins here and when you scroll down
00:25 - you will be able to see this option
00:27 - which says Jenkins CLI and so once you
00:30 - are in this Jenkins CLI section you will
00:33 - be able to see this command which you
00:35 - can use to get help on using Jenkins CLI
00:41 - now when you want to use Jenkins - for
00:46 - example build your job or add job to
00:48 - view or there is a list of command which
00:51 - you can use with Jenkins CLI you just
00:55 - need to click on the specific command
00:57 - which you want to execute for example I
00:59 - want to execute build command I can just
01:02 - click on this build command and then
01:05 - this is the command which I can use to
01:07 - build my job with some flags and the
01:11 - description of these flags are given
01:14 - here so let's use this Jenkins CLI
01:19 - command to build Jenkins job so first of
01:23 - all you need to download this Jenkins -
01:26 - CLI jar file and you can download it by
01:29 - clicking on this Jenkins CLI jar file
01:33 - and you can save it on your computer
01:36 - first of all and once this Jenkins CLI
01:38 - jar is downloaded you can copy this
01:42 - Jenkins CLI jar at the comfortable
01:46 - location and then use this gia jar to
01:49 - execute the command which is given here
01:52 - so let me open the terminal first of all
01:55 - and I will first fall create as Jenkins
01:58 - directory so mkdir Jenkins and I want to
02:04 - move this Jenkins CLI jar file into this
02:09 - directory so this is in my downloads
02:11 - folder so I'm going to
02:13 - right MV and then I will just move this
02:19 - jar file which I have downloaded from
02:23 - the Downloads folder to this Jenkins
02:26 - folder so I'm going to just give this
02:29 - command which is going to move this jar
02:32 - file into the Jenkins folder so I'm
02:34 - going to just CD to the Jenkins folder
02:37 - now and you can see this Jenkins CLI dot
02:40 - char is there so now I can use this
02:44 - command to build a job so let's see what
02:47 - job we can build so I have this job
02:50 - which is Java HelloWorld and let's build
02:54 - this job using the Jenkins CLI so the
02:58 - job name is Java HelloWorld so I'm going
03:02 - to just first of all copy this command
03:04 - up to job and then I'm going to just
03:08 - paste this command on my terminal and
03:12 - instead of job here you just need to
03:15 - give the name of your Jenkins job which
03:17 - you want to build so the name of the
03:19 - Jenkins job is Java HelloWorld which I
03:22 - will provide here and then press ENTER
03:24 - and of course this will fail because our
03:28 - Jenkins require the permission so right
03:32 - now we are logged in with the admin
03:34 - credentials that's why we need to give
03:37 - the admin credentials in case you want
03:40 - to execute your job without the
03:42 - credentials you can go to manage Jenkins
03:45 - and then go to configure global security
03:49 - and once you are in the configure global
03:52 - security there is a option under
03:55 - authentication we have previously chosen
03:57 - this option which is role based strategy
04:01 - right so if you want to disable this
04:03 - authentication you can choose this
04:05 - option which says anyone can do anything
04:08 - and save this configuration and once
04:12 - this configuration is saved this command
04:14 - will work because now we don't need any
04:18 - credentials to run the Jenkins job so
04:21 - once again I'm going to give this
04:23 - command and this time you can
04:27 - see it's successful and it hasn't given
04:29 - any error to us but you can see this
04:33 - command doesn't give any result it just
04:35 - executes and then no result is printed
04:39 - and when you go to the location where
04:42 - your Jenkins job is there on this
04:45 - Jenkins UI you will see this Jenkins job
04:48 - is executed but no result is printed
04:51 - here so for example you can see I have
04:54 - five bills right now and when I execute
04:57 - this command once again and I will
05:00 - refresh this web page you will be able
05:04 - to see a sixth bill is executed
05:06 - successfully here so now in case you
05:09 - want to see the output of your build on
05:12 - the terminal itself what you can do is
05:15 - you can go to this command once again
05:18 - from where you have copied and you can
05:20 - see there are a bunch of flags you can
05:23 - provide so the flag - F is going to show
05:28 - you the output of your Jenkins job so
05:33 - I'm going to just give the - F flag with
05:37 - my command and then press enter and you
05:40 - can see started Java HelloWorld build
05:43 - and you will be able to see here also
05:46 - the seventh build is executed
05:49 - successfully on the Jenkins UI also and
05:52 - some output is printed here also it's a
05:55 - started Java HelloWorld seventh build
05:58 - and that build status was successful now
06:01 - if you want to see more verbose output
06:04 - you can use this flag which is minus V
06:07 - and you can see this flag is used with
06:10 - minus s so we will give this flag which
06:15 - is minus V with minus s and then press
06:18 - Enter
06:19 - and you can see started the build number
06:22 - eight and you will see all the console
06:25 - output which you see generally on your
06:29 - Jenkins job so when I just refresh this
06:33 - and I will go to the console output here
06:36 - so this is the output which you see in
06:39 - the console output
06:41 - this output will be shown on the
06:44 - terminal also same output will be shown
06:46 - here and once again the build status is
06:49 - successful now in order to use this
06:52 - Jenkins CLI command with the
06:54 - authentication you just need to go to
06:57 - the manage Jenkins section once again
06:59 - and then go to configure global security
07:02 - and this time we will enable the in
07:05 - authentication the logged in user can do
07:08 - anything so you need to just choose this
07:12 - option
07:12 - it says logged in user can do anything
07:15 - and though you also need to check this
07:17 - option which says allow anonymous read
07:20 - access so this is important you need to
07:22 - check this option and this option as
07:26 - well which is logged in user can do
07:28 - anything and then I'm going to save this
07:31 - configuration and this time with this
07:34 - command so let me clear the terminal
07:36 - first of all so I'm going to clear the
07:38 - terminal and with this command which we
07:41 - have used to build the Java HelloWorld
07:45 - Jenkins job we will use the username so
07:48 - I'm going to just write - - user name
07:52 - and space the username is admin in my
07:56 - case and then to provide a password you
07:59 - just need to give this flag which is - -
08:03 - password and space your password so my
08:07 - password here is root so I'm going to
08:10 - give my password and then press enter
08:12 - and this is going to start the build you
08:15 - can see Java HelloWorld
08:17 - ix build was started and it's ended
08:22 - successfully so the build status is
08:24 - success here so in order to provide the
08:27 - credentials you just need to use these
08:29 - two flag which is username your username
08:32 - and - - password your password so now
08:35 - let me show you one more thing which is
08:37 - to execute a parameterised Jenkins job
08:41 - using command line so I'm going to go to
08:45 - my Jenkins home here and I'm going to
08:49 - choose a project which I have created in
08:51 - the last video which shows how to use
08:54 - parameter
08:54 - in your Jenkins job and its name was
08:58 - parameterised project now if you don't
09:02 - know how to create a parameterised
09:04 - Jenkins job you need to see the last
09:07 - video so I'm not going to create a new
09:09 - job I'm just going to use the Jenkins
09:12 - job which I have created earlier so in
09:15 - this Jenkins job we have this build with
09:18 - parameters option and there are two
09:21 - parameters here one is platform and
09:23 - other is choice so I'm going to just use
09:27 - this Jenkins job name first of all and
09:30 - I'm going to go to the terminal and let
09:33 - me clear the terminal and I'm going to
09:36 - use the same command but this time the
09:38 - project name is different so instead of
09:40 - Java HelloWorld the project name is
09:43 - parameterised project which is this one
09:46 - and in order to provide the parameters
09:49 - you need to give the flag which is minus
09:53 - P so at the end just add minus P and
09:57 - then your parameter name so the
10:00 - parameter name I have is first of all
10:03 - platform and it's better to use double
10:07 - quotes if you have single word then you
10:10 - can avoid these double quotes but I
10:13 - prefer to use these double quotes even
10:15 - if this is a single word string so here
10:20 - I'm going to just try it Linux now once
10:22 - again I'm going to just use minus P flag
10:26 - for providing the second parameter and
10:28 - the second parameter is a choice here so
10:31 - I'm going to once again use minus P
10:34 - choice which is the parameter name and
10:36 - then the parameter value so for example
10:39 - I want to just give C here as a choice
10:42 - and then I'm going to just press ENTER
10:44 - which is going to execute this job you
10:47 - can see the job is executed and you can
10:51 - see it has echoed the Linux keyboard and
10:55 - the C letter and the build was
10:59 - successful so this is how you can
11:02 - provide the parameters to your Jenkins
11:06 - job using Jenkins
11:08 - CLI so this is how you can use Jenkins
11:10 - CLI to execute your Jenkins build I hope
11:14 - you've enjoyed this video please rate

which is to execute a parameterised Jenkins job using command line so I'm going to go to my Jenkins home here and I'm going to choose a project which I have created in the last video which shows how
