With timestamps:

00:00 - and now in this video we will talk about
00:02 - uh how we can create files using cat
00:05 - command and also we will say some other
00:06 - operations using that command okay so uh
00:09 - let me increase the size of the terminal
00:11 - I think now it's fine and I will just
00:14 - open up my
00:16 - file system in my left hand side to
00:19 - be more clear with you guys okay
00:22 - so now what we will need to do we will
00:24 - we will have to learn about cat command
00:27 - okay so basically cat command we can use
00:29 - to create files and also we can use this
00:32 - cat command tool like concatenate some
00:34 - more files together or you can say like
00:37 - merging more than one file in a one
00:39 - single file okay you can also do it in
00:41 - this and also uh we can use it like uh
00:45 - like to get the how many uh numbers like
00:48 - to show the lines and all those things
00:50 - in this in the particular files okay so
00:52 - now we will start with the creating file
00:54 - okay
00:56 - so let me do first LS so I think I have
00:59 - some files directory
01:01 - or let me check what is there okay file
01:03 - on file 4 okay
01:05 - and what is uh
01:08 - let's create some files with cat command
01:11 - Okay so cat I will go with the test1.txt
01:18 - and what here the main benefit is that
01:20 - we can simultaneously write whatever we
01:22 - want to write in that particular test
01:23 - file
01:24 - so here I'm just writing this is
01:28 - test one file
01:31 - okay in txt format
01:35 - and what you have to do you have to just
01:37 - hit enter and then Ctrl T okay so in
01:40 - this way we can create files okay and
01:43 - now what we have to do
01:45 - we have to do LS and here you will see
01:47 - test1.txt has been created for you and
01:50 - here also you can see it okay now now
01:52 - the other feature of cat command is that
01:54 - like you can also read the contents of
01:58 - that text file so how you can do it you
02:00 - can just get and then the whatever the
02:03 - file name is there you can provide it
02:05 - okay at test1.xt
02:08 - I will hit enter and here you will see
02:10 - the whatever is the content of the file
02:14 - um like it is being printed here okay
02:18 - so uh this is the like two operations we
02:20 - covered and now what we will need to do
02:22 - uh I'll create one more file okay
02:27 - uh cat uh
02:29 - test2 Dot txt
02:32 - okay and here I will write this is
02:36 - test to file in
02:40 - txt format okay and just hit enter and
02:44 - then Ctrl D and now what we will do we
02:46 - will see the content of test2.txt and
02:49 - here you can see this is test 2 file in
02:52 - txt
02:53 - format okay now what we will need to do
02:56 - what I will do I will try to like
02:59 - concatenate
03:00 - like uh what you can say
03:03 - test test two content in test one okay
03:06 - so how I can do it get
03:09 - test1 dot txt then again this
03:13 - redirection operator this is called
03:15 - redirection operator
03:17 - and test2.txt hit enter I will try to
03:21 - see the content of first
03:23 - test one let's see what is there okay so
03:27 - basically this command like will append
03:29 - in test2.txt not in Textron sorry for
03:32 - that
03:32 - okay test two and here you can see like
03:36 - the whatever the content of test one
03:40 - file has been included in this
03:42 - particular test2 file okay from here you
03:45 - can see also like when I will just hit
03:48 - double click on it and here you can see
03:50 - the same thing here also okay
03:53 - so this is the one way of like appending
03:56 - uh two files together okay
03:59 - and what we can do uh if you want to
04:03 - like append content of those file in
04:06 - another some file likes suppose like
04:09 - test three file so what we will do we
04:12 - will there is just simple a cat
04:16 - uh test1.txt
04:19 - test2.txt
04:21 - and then nothing just a redirection
04:24 - operator and here we will write test3
04:26 - Dot txt and now what we will do we will
04:30 - see here like test 3 has been created
04:32 - also when we will do LS here you can see
04:34 - test 3 has been created now what we will
04:37 - do I will try to read the content of
04:40 - test 3.
04:43 - 3 Dot txt
04:47 - okay oh so here you can see the content
04:51 - of both the files like this is showing
04:53 - test on two terms because in test two uh
04:55 - it was there like this was the content
04:57 - of Testo file okay
04:59 - so in this way we can like merge
05:01 - multiple files as many you want okay and
05:05 - now a moving forward like now we will
05:09 - learn about some like uh what we can say
05:12 - little bit options which we can use with
05:14 - this cat command
05:16 - so first option I will uh I want to show
05:19 - you is cat hyphen n
05:23 - test3.txt
05:26 - so this command basically what it does
05:28 - it uh basically like show you the lines
05:31 - with number wise okay here you can see
05:33 - this is first line This is third line
05:36 - and similarly here also you can see the
05:38 - uh like all those things like one two
05:40 - three okay
05:43 - so
05:44 - this is the one way uh to like get the
05:48 - files by number wise and if you want to
05:51 - uh check the like end where is the
05:54 - ending of that all the line then at that
05:58 - time it will show you the dollar
05:59 - character at the end of the line okay
06:06 - here you can see like here the line is
06:08 - ending that's why it is showing dollar
06:10 - here what if we will do uh here I will
06:15 - change little bit uh like here I will
06:18 - change like uh this is
06:21 - another file and I will just hit Ctrl s
06:25 - and full stop also
06:29 - and let me cut this
06:33 - and here you can see the line is ending
06:35 - here okay
06:37 - so I hope you got it why it's showing
06:39 - dollar dollars because like here at this
06:41 - point of line uh
06:45 - sentence or at this point of word this
06:48 - line has been ended so here that's why
06:50 - here it is Swing dollar okay so this is
06:53 - the basic use of hyphen e command
06:57 - okay and now uh what if you want to add
07:01 - like
07:03 - some more content in uh like previous
07:06 - file previous file it means like it is
07:09 - already created you don't have to create
07:10 - anything for it so for that you don't
07:13 - have to do anything uh you have to just
07:18 - apply double the direction of it that is
07:20 - this one get and suppose I want to write
07:23 - in test1.txt
07:26 - okay and here first we will see the
07:28 - content of this so here you can see this
07:30 - is test on file index free format and I
07:33 - have to write
07:35 - something like this is
07:37 - a tutorial
07:40 - based on
07:41 - Linux
07:44 - cities or something like that okay and
07:47 - just hit Ctrl D okay and I will just
07:50 - like uh re-open this
07:54 - particular
07:55 - file
07:59 - um
08:00 - okay so here you can see like uh this is
08:04 - tutorial based online site has been like
08:06 - added in this particular
08:08 - test1.txt file okay
08:12 - and uh there is also one like uh option
08:15 - which we can see like uh hyphen T option
08:19 - okay so basically what it does uh it
08:23 - will show you the tab like where where
08:26 - is the tab in the particular line okay
08:31 - so what I will do now I will just
08:35 - like uh give a tab here okay one time
08:40 - two tab three time I'm giving here okay
08:44 - and just Ctrl s and the tab will be
08:48 - represented by this this symbol I think
08:51 - let's see what it shows cat file one dot
08:58 - sorry what is the file name okay
09:00 - test1.txt
09:02 - test one dot txt
09:05 - okay so this is the content which we saw
09:09 - and now what I will do I will just have
09:11 - to use the
09:12 - High 20 option and here you can see this
09:17 - is uh the particular symbol and I III
09:21 - it's showing like three tabs is there it
09:23 - is showing that's it okay so uh
09:27 - uh that's all about uh like this cat
09:31 - command okay I hope you liked it and if

what we will do I will try to read the content of test 3. 3 Dot txt okay oh so here you can see the content of both the files like this is showing test on two terms because in test two uh it was there like this was the content of Testo file okay so in this way we can like merge multiple files as many you want okay and now a moving forward like now we will learn about some like uh what we can say little bit options which we can use with this cat command so first option I will uh I want to show you is cat hyphen n test3.txt so this command basically what it does it uh basically like show you
