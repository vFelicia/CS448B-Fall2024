00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:03 - in this video we will see how we can use
00:06 - arrays in shell scripting now bash
00:09 - suppose simple one-dimensional arrays
00:12 - and to declare arrays you just need to
00:15 - use the name of the array so whatever
00:18 - name you want to give to your array
00:21 - variable just give it for example you
00:23 - want to have operated system array
00:27 - variables so I will just write OS is
00:30 - equal to this is the name of the array o
00:32 - X right and then you just use this
00:35 - parent ever and in the single quotes you
00:39 - just add the element to the array so for
00:43 - example I will just add Ubuntu here and
00:46 - then separate it by a space no comma you
00:50 - just need to add things a second the
00:53 - elements for example windows and so on
00:57 - so third for example we will add Kali
01:02 - Linux or Kali right and just save it and
01:06 - to print this array you just need to use
01:10 - echo and I think in the first few videos
01:13 - we have seen how we can print array but
01:15 - we will repeat this thing so just use
01:19 - dollar symbol and then in the curly
01:22 - bracket name of the array or a name is
01:25 - OS and then in the square bracket use
01:29 - the special character at the rate which
01:33 - is going to print the elements of the
01:35 - array so let's run the script and let's
01:37 - see what happens so you can see it
01:40 - prints the elements of the array right
01:44 - now in order to print any specific
01:47 - element you just need to use echo and
01:50 - once again dollar symbol curly brackets
01:53 - name of the array and the square bracket
01:56 - the index of the element which you want
01:58 - to print so for example I want to print
02:01 - Windows which is the first element and
02:05 - how it's the first element or for the
02:08 - first index the
02:09 - element or index of the array starts
02:13 - from the 0th position so this is the
02:16 - index 0 this is the index 1 and this is
02:20 - at the index 2 right
02:22 - so index 1 is assigned to the windows
02:27 - element right so let's run the script
02:31 - once again and let's see what happens so
02:33 - it prints windows if you right here 0th
02:36 - index it's going to print ubuntu right
02:41 - and let's go ahead and i'm going to show
02:46 - you how you can print the indexes or
02:50 - indices of the array so you just need to
02:54 - use once again the dollar symbol and the
02:57 - curly bracket and the name of the array
03:00 - and once again in the square bracket use
03:04 - the add the rate but this time here you
03:07 - just need to use not symbol this
03:11 - exclamation mark okay and let's see what
03:14 - happens when we run the script and you
03:17 - can see it trains the indexes of the
03:20 - array or indices of the array right so
03:23 - we have 3 element which starts from 0 1
03:27 - 2 so it prints 0 1 2 ok now for example
03:32 - you want to print the length of the
03:34 - array what we will do we will just write
03:36 - echo and once again echo and then the
03:42 - dollar symbol once again and then the
03:45 - square bracket name of the array and in
03:49 - the square bracket you just need to
03:52 - write at the rate special character and
03:55 - in front of the array variable name you
04:00 - just need to add this hash symbol okay
04:02 - and this means you want to print the
04:05 - length of the array okay so let's run
04:09 - the script and let's see what happens so
04:11 - you can see the array length in our case
04:14 - is 3 because it contains 3 elements
04:17 - right now how we can add elements to the
04:21 - array so to add elements
04:23 - you just need to write the name of the
04:27 - array and then whatever index at
04:31 - whatever index you want to add an
04:33 - element you just need to write the index
04:36 - of that element so for example I want to
04:38 - add at the index 3 some other OS name so
04:44 - for example I want to write Mac here
04:46 - okay so this will be added to the third
04:51 - index of this array now let's see what
04:53 - happens when we run the script you can
04:56 - see here this fourth element is added to
05:01 - an array at the index three right so in
05:06 - this way you can add the element now if
05:09 - you want to update this so for example I
05:11 - right here at the 0th index then this
05:16 - Mac will be assigned at the 0th index
05:19 - which is going to replace this ubuntu by
05:24 - Mac right so let's run the script and
05:27 - you can see now it has at the 0th index
05:32 - Mac then Windows then Kali okay so if
05:35 - you want to update it you just need to
05:38 - write the index of the element which you
05:41 - want to replace the new element with and
05:44 - then you just assign the element value
05:47 - okay now we will see how we are going to
05:52 - remove how can we remove element from an
05:56 - array so to remove an element from an
06:00 - array what we will do we will use the
06:03 - keyword unset so just write unset and
06:07 - then the name of the array so money
06:10 - array name is where and then whatever
06:14 - index of the element you want to remove
06:16 - so for example I want to remove the
06:20 - index at which Kali Linux is let me just
06:25 - edit this index also so Mac is at the
06:30 - third index right and Kali is at the
06:33 - second index so 0 1 2 ok so I am going
06:36 - to remove
06:37 - the callee from my array right so just
06:41 - write the index value of the element
06:45 - which you want to remove and then once
06:47 - again run the script and you can see now
06:52 - we have open to Windows and Mac and no
06:56 - Colleen right now you may ask why it's
07:00 - printing like this because we already
07:03 - have removed the element at index two
07:08 - right so it's like that that in bash
07:13 - you can add element at any index so it
07:17 - can be for example at fixed index and
07:21 - nothing is going to happen it's going to
07:23 - print the elements of the array in the
07:27 - sequence of the index right so if it
07:30 - it's at the fixed index it will be
07:33 - sorted in the ascending order so 0 1 and
07:37 - then if it it it is at the 6th position
07:41 - or index and it's going to just print
07:44 - the value at the fixed index and now
07:47 - this position will be ignored so this
07:49 - means that some members of the array can
07:53 - be left uninitialized and gaps in the
07:56 - arrays are okay now bash permits arrays
08:00 - operation on variables also even if the
08:04 - variables are not explicitly declared as
08:07 - an arrays so let's take an example so I
08:11 - have a variable name called string for
08:14 - example and I assign any value to it so
08:18 - let's say this random string right
08:21 - now when I I will just take this echo
08:26 - come on here and then I will just print
08:30 - the string right string array and let's
08:34 - see what happens so let me clear the
08:36 - terminal and let's run the script once
08:38 - again and you can see here it prints the
08:42 - you know array or string value as it is
08:47 - right so you can see string is printed
08:49 - right so
08:50 - taking this string as an array so you
08:54 - can use this kind of notation also but
08:57 - let's print for example the 0th index of
09:03 - the array so once again I'm going to
09:06 - just write 0 here instead of at the rate
09:10 - I will just write 0 and then once again
09:13 - run the script and it prints the same
09:16 - string value right let me just print the
09:20 - index 1 value and here the magic happens
09:24 - you can see at index 1 there is nothing
09:27 - so why this is happening because you are
09:31 - going to treat any variable as an array
09:35 - the array element value at 0 10 Dex
09:39 - whatever the value of the variable it's
09:43 - assigned at the 0th index right so you
09:46 - can treat any variable as an array but
09:50 - the value of this array will be assigned
09:54 - to the 0th index okay so at the first
09:58 - index there is nothing because the whole
10:02 - value is assigned to the 0th index and
10:06 - this we can prove by printing the length
10:09 - of the array also so let's print the
10:11 - length of this string array and let's
10:14 - see what happens so you can see the
10:16 - length of the string array is only 1
10:18 - which is this one ok so this is how you
10:23 - can use arrays in bash scripting I hope

hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use arrays in shell scripting now bash suppose simple onedimensional arrays and to declare arrays you just need to use the name of the array so whatever name you want to give to your array variable just give it for example you want to have operated system array variables so I will just write OS is equal to this is the name of the array o X right and then you just use this parent ever and in the single quotes you just add the element to the array so for example I will just add Ubuntu here and then separate it by a space no comma you just need to add things a second the elements for example windows and so on so third for example we will add Kali Linux or Kali right and just save it and to print this array you just need to use echo and I think in the first few videos we have seen how we can print array but we will repeat this thing so just use dollar symbol and then in the curly bracket name of the array or a name is OS and then in the square bracket use the special character at the rate which is going to print the elements of the array so let's run the script and let's see what happens so you can see it prints the elements of the array right now in order to print any specific element you just need to use echo and once again dollar symbol curly brackets name of the array and the square bracket the index of the element which you want to print so for example I want to print Windows which is the first element and how it's the first element or for the first index the element or index of the array starts from the 0th position so this is the index 0 this is the index 1 and this is at the index 2 right so index 1 is assigned to the windows element right so let's run the script once again and let's see what happens so it prints windows if you right here 0th index it's going to print ubuntu right and let's go ahead and i'm going to show you how you can print the indexes or indices of the array so you just need to use once again the dollar symbol and the curly bracket and the name of the array and once again in the square bracket use the add the rate but this time here you just need to use not symbol this exclamation mark okay and let's see what happens when we run the script and you can see it trains the indexes of the array or indices of the array right so we have 3 element which starts from 0 1 2 so it prints 0 1 2 ok now for example you want to print the length of the array what we will do we will just write echo and once again echo and then the dollar symbol once again and then the square bracket name of the array and in the square bracket you just need to write at the rate special character and in front of the array variable name you just need to add this hash symbol okay and this means you want to print the length of the array okay so let's run the script and let's see what happens so you can see the array length in our case is 3 because it contains 3 elements right now how we can add elements to the array so to add elements you just need to write the name of the array and then whatever index at whatever index you want to add an element you just need to write the index of that element so for example I want to add at the index 3 some other OS name so for example I want to write Mac here okay so this will be added to the third index of this array now let's see what happens when we run the script you can see here this fourth element is added to an array at the index three right so in this way you can add the element now if you want to update this so for example I right here at the 0th index then this Mac will be assigned at the 0th index which is going to replace this ubuntu by Mac right so let's run the script and you can see now it has at the 0th index Mac then Windows then Kali okay so if you want to update it you just need to write the index of the element which you want to replace the new element with and then you just assign the element value okay now we will see how we are going to remove how can we remove element from an array so to remove an element from an array what we will do we will use the keyword unset so just write unset and then the name of the array so money array name is where and then whatever index of the element you want to remove so for example I want to remove the index at which Kali Linux is let me just edit this index also so Mac is at the third index right and Kali is at the second index so 0 1 2 ok so I am going to remove the callee from my array right so just write the index value of the element which you want to remove and then once again run the script and you can see now we have open to Windows and Mac and no Colleen right now you may ask why it's printing like this because we already have removed the element at index two right so it's like that that in bash you can add element at any index so it can be for example at fixed index and nothing is going to happen it's going to print the elements of the array in the sequence of the index right so if it it's at the fixed index it will be sorted in the ascending order so 0 1 and then if it it it is at the 6th position or index and it's going to just print the value at the fixed index and now this position will be ignored so this means that some members of the array can be left uninitialized and gaps in the arrays are okay now bash permits arrays operation on variables also even if the variables are not explicitly declared as an arrays so let's take an example so I have a variable name called string for example and I assign any value to it so let's say this random string right now when I I will just take this echo come on here and then I will just print the string right string array and let's see what happens so let me clear the terminal and let's run the script once again and you can see here it prints the you know array or string value as it is right so you can see string is printed right so taking this string as an array so you can use this kind of notation also but let's print for example the 0th index of the array so once again I'm going to just write 0 here instead of at the rate I will just write 0 and then once again run the script and it prints the same string value right let me just print the index 1 value and here the magic happens you can see at index 1 there is nothing so why this is happening because you are going to treat any variable as an array the array element value at 0 10 Dex whatever the value of the variable it's assigned at the 0th index right so you can treat any variable as an array but the value of this array will be assigned to the 0th index okay so at the first index there is nothing because the whole value is assigned to the 0th index and this we can prove by printing the length of the array also so let's print the length of this string array and let's see what happens so you can see the length of the string array is only 1 which is this one ok so this is how you can use arrays in bash scripting I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
