With timestamps:

00:01 - hello and welcome back to the another
00:02 - video of the ciao tutorial Series so
00:04 - till now we have covered exercise two
00:07 - part one and this is video for the
00:09 - exercise two part two wherein we will be
00:11 - covering the solution for the two
00:14 - programs that's the fourth and fifth one
00:16 - so let's
00:18 - get started uh what is the problem
00:21 - statement write a program that from prom
00:23 - prompts the user to an import and
00:25 - integer and then outputs the number with
00:27 - the digits reverse so basically uh one
00:30 - string we have to provide to the user
00:32 - and we have to reverse it okay for
00:34 - example uh if the string is one two
00:36 - three four five then the output should
00:38 - be a five four three two one okay
00:41 - so let me just open my IDE and this is
00:45 - the previous video we have seen first
00:48 - second and third
00:49 - question solution now I will continue
00:52 - here for the fourth solution so we
00:55 - required to take input from the user
00:57 - uh that I have that's why I have
01:00 - imported the scanner class okay and now
01:03 - I just required one number because we
01:06 - have two reverse and numbers
01:09 - okay so I have declared a variable call
01:11 - number and another variable which will
01:14 - hold
01:16 - the number which which is reversed one
01:19 - okay
01:20 - now I will print
01:24 - I will accept one input from the user
01:27 - enter the number
01:34 - then here
01:36 - I will write number is equals to
01:40 - uh let me just see what is my object
01:43 - name for Scandal yes SC Dot
01:48 - next int okay so we have accepted one
01:52 - input from the user and store it inside
01:54 - the variable called number now I have I
01:57 - will require one another variable called
01:59 - temps and one variable name
02:04 - remainder and I will assign the value of
02:07 - 0 to it okay so here I will be using
02:10 - while loop
02:15 - while
02:17 - my
02:19 - 10 piece
02:21 - greater than
02:22 - zero
02:24 - okay and oops I forgot to assign value
02:28 - to the temp so tells you will hold the
02:30 - value of the number the because we are
02:34 - in this line number 40 44 we are
02:37 - assigning the numbers value to the 10
02:39 - because we are we are not changing or
02:42 - modifying the actual number because we
02:44 - required that number to check whether
02:46 - that a original number of the reverse
02:48 - number are the same or not that's why I
02:50 - have to copied that number inside the
02:51 - temp variable
02:53 - okay
02:55 - so here we will write remainder is
02:58 - equals to
03:02 - 10
03:04 - mod 10. and after that don't worry I
03:08 - will explain you what I have done here
03:12 - just watch
03:13 - these words into
03:17 - sorry 10 plus
03:21 - Commander okay and again
03:26 - temp is equals to
03:29 - temp divided is equals to 10
03:34 - and in line number 54 let me just
03:38 - increase the font size
03:42 - okay in line number 54 is same as this
03:46 - so don't get confused what I have done
03:49 - here temp is equals to
03:52 - wait a minute I will just comment it out
03:58 - 10 is equals to 10 divided by 10. so and
04:04 - that's just a shortcut to write
04:06 - this whole statement okay uh this is
04:10 - what I'm doing in the while loop and
04:13 - after that
04:14 - I'll print
04:17 - and check
04:19 - not it we just have to reverse okay
04:23 - reviews
04:27 - oh
04:30 - number holds the original number
04:34 - all right eggs
04:38 - and our reverse number is inside the
04:41 - reverse template variable okay
04:44 - viewers
04:51 - okay so this is the string this is the
04:55 - actual
04:56 - okay
04:57 - so here you can see uh let's suppose I
05:00 - have uh let me explain you
05:03 - what I have done here inside the while
05:04 - loop
05:05 - okay
05:07 - so let's suppose our input is one two
05:10 - three four five okay and our 10th will
05:14 - hold the number
05:16 - 's value that is the actual number value
05:18 - okay
05:20 - and uh whether my time is criticism 0
05:22 - whether this is greater than zero
05:26 - whether this is greater than zero yes it
05:29 - will come inside inside the loop and a
05:31 - remainder is equals to Temp mod 10.
05:37 - mod 10 okay so here
05:42 - the remainder will get stored when that
05:44 - is the last digit mod 10 the last digit
05:47 - will get stored inside the remainder
05:50 - okay and now reverse value here
05:52 - initially reverse value is zero so here
05:56 - 0 into
05:58 - 10 that is 0
06:01 - plus 5 so this will result 5 and in
06:06 - first iteration reverse value will get
06:09 - stored as 5 and in here we have just
06:11 - divided dividing our temp number by 10
06:15 - means
06:16 - one two three four five divided by ten
06:20 - which is equals to one two three four
06:23 - and again we are going to check for the
06:26 - loop and again and this time we will be
06:29 - checking whether the one two three four
06:30 - is greater than zero yes it will come
06:33 - inside the loop and it will by mod 10 we
06:36 - will we will be getting the last digit
06:38 - of this number that is 4 and inside uh
06:41 - reverse then now the reverse value
06:44 - previously was 5. 5 into original uh 10
06:51 - 5 into 10 is 50. plus what is the new
06:55 - remainder's value is 4 plus 4 now this
06:58 - is this is equals to 54.
07:01 - Okay so
07:03 - this is 54 and now we again we will
07:06 - divide 10th value by 10 so now the 10th
07:10 - value is 1 2 3 okay so this how this is
07:14 - how so while loop will run and one point
07:16 - will came where the tenth value will be
07:18 - 0 and where 0 is greater than 0 will be
07:21 - get evaluated as false and we will get
07:24 - out of this Loop and we will just print
07:27 - the original number and the reverse
07:28 - number okay
07:30 - so let me just run this
07:34 - wait by the way if you guys are liking
07:37 - this series
07:38 - do comment and like and share okay so
07:41 - the number I will give input as one two
07:44 - three four five
07:45 - and that's let's see here you can see
07:48 - reverse of one two three four five is
07:50 - okay just let me give one space over
07:53 - here five four three two one okay so if
07:57 - you guys don't know how the loop is
07:59 - running then please do watch the loop
08:01 - video that I have covered uh each and
08:04 - every Loop which is there in the Java
08:06 - and if you want to
08:09 - see how this is working then you can put
08:13 - one debug pointer over here
08:15 - not here
08:17 - wait here and you can just debug this
08:21 - okay
08:23 - and wait allow excess
08:27 - okay so my debug pointer is here I will
08:31 - click on here okay scanner class I will
08:35 - take
08:36 - in the console I will input the number
08:38 - one two three four five okay now I will
08:42 - go in the debugger now you can see
08:44 - number value is one two three four five
08:46 - which is getting stored inside it uh now
08:49 - again if I click remainder is 0 and see
08:52 - it is violating as true because one two
08:55 - three four five is greater than zero
08:57 - okay it will come inside the loop and it
09:00 - will do one two three four five more ten
09:03 - and the remainder value will get in
09:05 - stored is zero and here you can see uh
09:09 - now after executing the 40 48 line
09:12 - remainder value will getting stored as
09:14 - five okay because one two three four
09:17 - five more ten is equals to five okay so
09:20 - what is the reverse value initially 0 0
09:23 - into 10 0 plus 5 plus 5 is equal to five
09:26 - now if if I click here here you can see
09:30 - reverse value will be updated as 5 and
09:32 - the better will S5 and after doing this
09:35 - now the is eliminated from that original
09:38 - time number because if I do one two
09:41 - three four five divided by 10 it it
09:44 - gives me one two three four okay uh like
09:46 - this you you can debug this debugger is
09:50 - best when you don't know how the loops
09:53 - are working internally how the flow flow
09:55 - of the code is going okay so you can use
09:58 - this feature of debugging
10:01 - okay so that that is about program
10:05 - number four let
10:07 - let's go into the program number five
10:09 - okay so what is program number five
10:11 - write a program to print the Fibonacci
10:13 - series of n terms where n is the import
10:15 - by the user
10:17 - okay so I hope you know what is
10:20 - Fibonacci series
10:22 - if no let me just comment it out and I
10:26 - will explain okay
10:28 - so here
10:29 - we are
10:31 - I'm commenting out this as fifth
10:35 - solution okay
10:37 - so Fibonacci series is nothing but uh
10:39 - let me just comment it out and I will
10:41 - show you Fibonacci series start from the
10:42 - uh zero
10:45 - and it goes like 0 1 1
10:50 - 2 like that because what is the formula
10:53 - for the Fibonacci series is nothing but
10:55 - the uh the place where the number is is
10:58 - a pre addition of the previous two
11:00 - numbers okay this uh series start from
11:03 - zero and one the third number will
11:04 - determine as a addition of the previous
11:07 - two numbers okay so what is 0 plus 1 is
11:09 - 1 and now for this position we we have
11:12 - to add
11:14 - to its previous two numbers okay what is
11:16 - one plus one that is equals to two and
11:18 - likewise a series goes on okay so we are
11:21 - we have to print the series here okay so
11:25 - I I again I require one
11:28 - variable number
11:32 - okay to hold the number of terms which
11:36 - is given by the user and I will again
11:38 - required one variable called as first
11:44 - and I will assign that 0 because the
11:47 - series start from
11:49 - 0 okay and the second term of the series
11:51 - is one
11:55 - and that is going to hold here and the
11:58 - third
12:00 - down
12:01 - okay now let me just give it okay third
12:06 - okay now
12:10 - I will just print one line where we
12:13 - require is telling the user to put one
12:16 - number enter the
12:20 - number of
12:22 - terms
12:25 - so sorry
12:26 - you want
12:29 - in the series
12:34 - okay and
12:36 - over here
12:37 - I will be doing SC dot next in sorry
12:46 - I see dot next chain okay
12:49 - now
12:51 - after getting input from the user
12:55 - I will just print the first two number
12:58 - of the series because those are fixed
13:01 - those will never change because series
13:03 - start from zero and one as we know okay
13:05 - and after this I will give one space
13:09 - between two numbers and again again I
13:13 - will concatenate it with second term
13:16 - now I will be running one for Loop
13:20 - squares int
13:22 - I is equals to 3 by this time uh I hope
13:27 - you guys are getting oh I have wrote
13:29 - three over there because the first two
13:31 - terms are fixed and uh I don't want my
13:35 - Loop to run from 0 or 1 because first
13:38 - and second terms are fixed okay so
13:40 - that's why I am learning running my loop
13:42 - from third position and my eyes value is
13:47 - less than equals to the numbers value
13:51 - each time I am doing I plus plus okay
13:56 - so over here I will be assigning the
13:59 - third term is equals to the addition of
14:02 - the first term and the second term okay
14:07 - and I will be printing
14:12 - third term
14:14 - and after that I will be giving one
14:16 - space so that the next next time I will
14:20 - be printing the uh another term so that
14:23 - one extra space would be there between
14:26 - each term okay so here I don't require
14:29 - Ln because
14:31 - I don't want the series to be printed in
14:33 - the straight line I will I want the
14:35 - present to print the series in the one
14:37 - line itself okay
14:39 - so over here I will be assigning the
14:42 - first term value as the second term
14:46 - and the second term membrane should be
14:51 - third
14:54 - okay so here you can see uh first term
14:57 - and second terms are fixed for the first
14:58 - first time when we are iterating our
15:01 - Loop that is 0 and 1 third term value
15:04 - will be a zero plus one is one we will
15:06 - print the one as third term and we will
15:09 - update the value of the first step to
15:11 - the second term that is the second terms
15:13 - value is one and and the second terms
15:16 - value L third term that is one so that
15:18 - next time if we iterate through this
15:20 - Loop that is one plus one is true two
15:23 - okay
15:24 - and I guess this is pretty much about
15:27 - the fifth question
15:28 - let me just stop the run it okay
15:34 - okay that are the number of series that
15:36 - you want okay so let me just get the
15:39 - first 10 numbers of the series
15:41 - so over here you can see the first 10
15:43 - number of the series is zero one uh this
15:46 - is not eleven uh I have done one mistake
15:48 - over here I have to print one
15:51 - extra space over here for that it will
15:54 - distinguish between this one and one
15:56 - okay let me just again run this
16:01 - so over here you can see zero one one
16:05 - two three five eight thirteen Twenty One
16:07 - thirty four and then these are the ten
16:09 - numbers of the first
16:10 - first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series
16:13 - okay
16:14 - so for this problem also uh you can put
16:17 - one debug pointer over here and uh right
16:20 - click and click on the debug okay it
16:23 - will run in the debug board where you
16:25 - can
16:26 - see how the loops are working internally
16:29 - okay
16:30 - so that this is pretty much about the
16:33 - exercise too I hope you guys have give
16:36 - it a try to solve this question and I
16:39 - will see you in the next one thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to the another video of the ciao tutorial Series so till now we have covered exercise two part one and this is video for the exercise two part two wherein we will be covering the solution for the two programs that's the fourth and fifth one so let's get started uh what is the problem statement write a program that from prom prompts the user to an import and integer and then outputs the number with the digits reverse so basically uh one string we have to provide to the user and we have to reverse it okay for example uh if the string is one two three four five then the output should be a five four three two one okay so let me just open my IDE and this is the previous video we have seen first second and third question solution now I will continue here for the fourth solution so we required to take input from the user uh that I have that's why I have imported the scanner class okay and now I just required one number because we have two reverse and numbers okay so I have declared a variable call number and another variable which will hold the number which which is reversed one okay now I will print I will accept one input from the user enter the number then here I will write number is equals to uh let me just see what is my object name for Scandal yes SC Dot next int okay so we have accepted one input from the user and store it inside the variable called number now I have I will require one another variable called temps and one variable name remainder and I will assign the value of 0 to it okay so here I will be using while loop while my 10 piece greater than zero okay and oops I forgot to assign value to the temp so tells you will hold the value of the number the because we are in this line number 40 44 we are assigning the numbers value to the 10 because we are we are not changing or modifying the actual number because we required that number to check whether that a original number of the reverse number are the same or not that's why I have to copied that number inside the temp variable okay so here we will write remainder is equals to 10 mod 10. and after that don't worry I will explain you what I have done here just watch these words into sorry 10 plus Commander okay and again temp is equals to temp divided is equals to 10 and in line number 54 let me just increase the font size okay in line number 54 is same as this so don't get confused what I have done here temp is equals to wait a minute I will just comment it out 10 is equals to 10 divided by 10. so and that's just a shortcut to write this whole statement okay uh this is what I'm doing in the while loop and after that I'll print and check not it we just have to reverse okay reviews oh number holds the original number all right eggs and our reverse number is inside the reverse template variable okay viewers okay so this is the string this is the actual okay so here you can see uh let's suppose I have uh let me explain you what I have done here inside the while loop okay so let's suppose our input is one two three four five okay and our 10th will hold the number 's value that is the actual number value okay and uh whether my time is criticism 0 whether this is greater than zero whether this is greater than zero yes it will come inside inside the loop and a remainder is equals to Temp mod 10. mod 10 okay so here the remainder will get stored when that is the last digit mod 10 the last digit will get stored inside the remainder okay and now reverse value here initially reverse value is zero so here 0 into 10 that is 0 plus 5 so this will result 5 and in first iteration reverse value will get stored as 5 and in here we have just divided dividing our temp number by 10 means one two three four five divided by ten which is equals to one two three four and again we are going to check for the loop and again and this time we will be checking whether the one two three four is greater than zero yes it will come inside the loop and it will by mod 10 we will we will be getting the last digit of this number that is 4 and inside uh reverse then now the reverse value previously was 5. 5 into original uh 10 5 into 10 is 50. plus what is the new remainder's value is 4 plus 4 now this is this is equals to 54. Okay so this is 54 and now we again we will divide 10th value by 10 so now the 10th value is 1 2 3 okay so this how this is how so while loop will run and one point will came where the tenth value will be 0 and where 0 is greater than 0 will be get evaluated as false and we will get out of this Loop and we will just print the original number and the reverse number okay so let me just run this wait by the way if you guys are liking this series do comment and like and share okay so the number I will give input as one two three four five and that's let's see here you can see reverse of one two three four five is okay just let me give one space over here five four three two one okay so if you guys don't know how the loop is running then please do watch the loop video that I have covered uh each and every Loop which is there in the Java and if you want to see how this is working then you can put one debug pointer over here not here wait here and you can just debug this okay and wait allow excess okay so my debug pointer is here I will click on here okay scanner class I will take in the console I will input the number one two three four five okay now I will go in the debugger now you can see number value is one two three four five which is getting stored inside it uh now again if I click remainder is 0 and see it is violating as true because one two three four five is greater than zero okay it will come inside the loop and it will do one two three four five more ten and the remainder value will get in stored is zero and here you can see uh now after executing the 40 48 line remainder value will getting stored as five okay because one two three four five more ten is equals to five okay so what is the reverse value initially 0 0 into 10 0 plus 5 plus 5 is equal to five now if if I click here here you can see reverse value will be updated as 5 and the better will S5 and after doing this now the is eliminated from that original time number because if I do one two three four five divided by 10 it it gives me one two three four okay uh like this you you can debug this debugger is best when you don't know how the loops are working internally how the flow flow of the code is going okay so you can use this feature of debugging okay so that that is about program number four let let's go into the program number five okay so what is program number five write a program to print the Fibonacci series of n terms where n is the import by the user okay so I hope you know what is Fibonacci series if no let me just comment it out and I will explain okay so here we are I'm commenting out this as fifth solution okay so Fibonacci series is nothing but uh let me just comment it out and I will show you Fibonacci series start from the uh zero and it goes like 0 1 1 2 like that because what is the formula for the Fibonacci series is nothing but the uh the place where the number is is a pre addition of the previous two numbers okay this uh series start from zero and one the third number will determine as a addition of the previous two numbers okay so what is 0 plus 1 is 1 and now for this position we we have to add to its previous two numbers okay what is one plus one that is equals to two and likewise a series goes on okay so we are we have to print the series here okay so I I again I require one variable number okay to hold the number of terms which is given by the user and I will again required one variable called as first and I will assign that 0 because the series start from 0 okay and the second term of the series is one and that is going to hold here and the third down okay now let me just give it okay third okay now I will just print one line where we require is telling the user to put one number enter the number of terms so sorry you want in the series okay and over here I will be doing SC dot next in sorry I see dot next chain okay now after getting input from the user I will just print the first two number of the series because those are fixed those will never change because series start from zero and one as we know okay and after this I will give one space between two numbers and again again I will concatenate it with second term now I will be running one for Loop squares int I is equals to 3 by this time uh I hope you guys are getting oh I have wrote three over there because the first two terms are fixed and uh I don't want my Loop to run from 0 or 1 because first and second terms are fixed okay so that's why I am learning running my loop from third position and my eyes value is less than equals to the numbers value each time I am doing I plus plus okay so over here I will be assigning the third term is equals to the addition of the first term and the second term okay and I will be printing third term and after that I will be giving one space so that the next next time I will be printing the uh another term so that one extra space would be there between each term okay so here I don't require Ln because I don't want the series to be printed in the straight line I will I want the present to print the series in the one line itself okay so over here I will be assigning the first term value as the second term and the second term membrane should be third okay so here you can see uh first term and second terms are fixed for the first first time when we are iterating our Loop that is 0 and 1 third term value will be a zero plus one is one we will print the one as third term and we will update the value of the first step to the second term that is the second terms value is one and and the second terms value L third term that is one so that next time if we iterate through this Loop that is one plus one is true two okay and I guess this is pretty much about the fifth question let me just stop the run it okay okay that are the number of series that you want okay so let me just get the first 10 numbers of the series so over here you can see the first 10 number of the series is zero one uh this is not eleven uh I have done one mistake over here I have to print one extra space over here for that it will distinguish between this one and one okay let me just again run this so over here you can see zero one one two three five eight thirteen Twenty One thirty four and then these are the ten numbers of the first first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series okay so for this problem also uh you can put one debug pointer over here and uh right click and click on the debug okay it will run in the debug board where you can see how the loops are working internally okay so that this is pretty much about the exercise too I hope you guys have give it a try to solve this question and I will see you in the next one thank you
