00:00 - hello guys in earlier video I had shown
00:03 - you how to do the looping and writing
00:06 - functions for last at acid so before
00:09 - that I had to clean the data so we can
00:12 - see that we had cleaned the column doors
00:14 - etcetera so what I will show you today
00:17 - is we will export this data into a new
00:20 - file format so what we can do after this
00:24 - will add one new cell and inside that we
00:30 - call our data frame we have carseat data
00:33 - - ok then we will call a function it is
00:40 - to underscore CSV so this is for
00:43 - exporting into CSV format and we give
00:48 - our name of the file which you want to
00:49 - create so that's a filtered dot CSV okay
00:57 - and we don't want index so we will give
01:01 - index equal to false it is indexed color
01:05 - will not be included and the separator
01:09 - if you want in you but by default
01:13 - separator for comma CSV is gamma so we
01:16 - don't need this if you press shift enter
01:20 - our file will be created
01:22 - let's see okay it was you can see
01:29 - filtered CSV is included now okay
01:34 - and now what we can do will we head down
01:39 - the lake functions etcetera so we had
01:41 - added some extra columns price classic
01:45 - cetera so we will just run them one by
01:47 - one I am going down pressing shift enter
02:03 - you can say so you can see we got all
02:11 - the columns along with that we got price
02:14 - class H converted kilometer per month
02:16 - and then H converted again
02:18 - so we can see we had created on extra
02:20 - column so I will show you how to remove
02:23 - this so for this what we can do
02:25 - we'll call our data thing straight up to
02:29 - and equate it to called data frame again
02:38 - and then we will use drop function so
02:40 - inside that we have to pass the column
02:43 - which you want to remove so columns
02:45 - equal to you can do more than one column
02:49 - also it can give only one column value
02:52 - only one column which is capital a
02:56 - converted if you run this again you can
03:05 - see now the H converted is removed ok so
03:09 - this is how we remove the columns which
03:12 - we don't want
03:13 - and now I'll show you how to sort the
03:16 - values so sorting can be done by using
03:19 - this command so for that they call our
03:23 - data frame cos theta two dot sort
03:28 - underscore values so this is a function
03:31 - so inside that we have to pass the
03:34 - columns which we on which we want to
03:36 - sort the data frame so I'm gonna salt on
03:41 - fairy-type and HP let's say
03:44 - we'll die with the first fear it
03:49 - and you can do one more than one also
03:51 - also column can now which direction you
03:54 - want to to so I will do in ascending
03:56 - that is lowest lowest count first
04:00 - so here I sending in scented be able to
04:03 - pass one or zero coupons one means yes
04:07 - in zero means no so ascending equal to 1
04:10 - so that is yes so now if you run this
04:14 - you can see the fare type now is has
04:18 - come in CNG because C is the alphabet in
04:22 - alphabet C comes first then we have D
04:25 - Diesel and then all the non values in
04:30 - the middle we have petrol but it is not
04:32 - displayed because of the it can't show
04:35 - all the values here so it can also
04:38 - include other data frames such as HP so
04:46 - for that what we can do inside this list
04:49 - only will get HP ok and we have
04:57 - integrated one value extra so will
04:59 - include I will give 0 that is I don't
05:02 - want it to be a sending word now you can
05:06 - see this is same but HP 110 10 50 90 so
05:13 - it is not sorted okay so this is how I
05:16 - think sort there is one more function
05:21 - called describe cos theta2 dot describe
05:39 - so if we call this function what it will
05:43 - do it will give you all the description
05:47 - of the different columns so you can see
05:50 - the count how many elements of price are
05:52 - there then th you can see 1 3 3 6 of 1 3
05:56 - 3 6 elements are there in each column
05:59 - like that
06:00 - and then for me it gives you the mean
06:04 - average of the price then for age that
06:07 - way it gives for all the columns then it
06:10 - gives standard deviation for all the
06:12 - columns then minimum number of minimum
06:16 - value in a particular column to use then
06:21 - it will give you about 25% 50% and 75%
06:25 - value of all the columns then it will
06:29 - give you maximum value of all the
06:31 - columns
06:33 - so this is this comes have up this comes
06:36 - in handy if you are not going to find
06:38 - standard deviation or minimum value or
06:41 - main value and one more thing you can
06:53 - export to other format also so if you
06:57 - want to format like cos theta2 dot we
07:06 - had gone to CSV we can do also to excel
07:09 - or proof text but for that also we use
07:14 - CSV
07:15 - can you see se for converting into text
07:19 - file so we'll give this name as modified
07:24 - dot txt the separator is voltage so
07:32 - we'll use tab and do you want to use
07:41 - index so I will kill index equal to
07:44 - false
07:47 - and we can check by using last at least
07:51 - today I have and you can see modified
07:55 - but tht is created how to do the
07:58 - aggregate statistics now that is using
08:00 - group by function so first for that
08:03 - first what we will do is will input data
08:09 - like this with filtered CSV into the new
08:13 - data frame and we can do that is in read
08:18 - CSV function of pandas latterly inside
08:23 - that will pass the name of the file in
08:29 - our case it is filter dot CSV and what
08:37 - we can do is we'll send comp so what we
08:43 - can do is field based on date of a beer
08:48 - cos theta 3 inside that will create a
08:51 - new column so you can just give it here
08:54 - temporarily
08:55 - it's count equal to 1 and now what we
08:59 - can do we can use already tough rain
09:03 - dot will call group I function and
09:08 - inside that we want to give the two
09:13 - columns on which you want to do the
09:15 - grouping so earlier I had shown you if
09:21 - you type NHP so on those we can group by
09:25 - so type then we'll pass this is a list
09:36 - so it is not the slicing operator it is
09:39 - released so thank you the next column
09:42 - that is HP
09:49 - and after that after group by what we
09:53 - can do
09:54 - Williams count function to counted wrong
09:58 - number of values and we'll set that
10:02 - value inside the count column now if you
10:08 - run this
10:13 - how many have to close this if you run
10:17 - this now you can see it is giving the
10:19 - insult value so favorite type in HP so
10:23 - it is group ID on CNG so how many HP are
10:27 - there on trend 10 so how many values are
10:31 - there 15 number of values are of CNG
10:34 - type and HP is hundred and ten in diesel
10:37 - fear death over here
10:39 - HP is 69 for 31 cars for 72 HP we have
10:45 - 69 cars and one car has 73 like that we
10:49 - are given and for petrol we can see 296
10:52 - cars are of 86 HP so by this you can get
10:59 - greater insight using group by function
11:03 - so this works same as in the way we do
11:07 - the SQL queries if you have tried SQL
11:10 - queries this would be very easy for you
11:11 - to understand you can give any other
11:15 - column here you can give more than one
11:18 - column also so this is how you can use a
11:20 - grim statistics for grouping two or more
11:23 - columns

hello guys in earlier video I had shown you how to do the looping and writing functions for last at acid so before that I had to clean the data so we can see that we had cleaned the column doors

had added some extra columns price classic cetera so we will just run them one by one I am going down pressing shift enter you can say so you can see we got all the columns along with that we got price class H converted kilometer per month and then H converted again so we can see we had created on extra column so I will show you how to remove this so for this what we can do we'll call our data

than one column also it can give only one column value only one column which is capital a converted if you run this again you can see now the H converted is removed ok so this is how we remove the columns which we don't want and now I'll show you how to sort the values so sorting can be done by using this command so for that they call our data frame cos theta two dot sort underscore values so this is a function so inside that we have to pass the columns which we on which we want to sort the data frame so I'm gonna salt on fairytype and HP let's say we'll die with the first fear it and you can do one more than one also also column can now which direction you want to to so I will do in ascending that is lowest lowest count first so here I sending in scented be able to pass one or zero coupons one means yes in zero means no so ascending equal to 1 so that is yes so now if you run this you can see the fare type now is has come in CNG because C is the alphabet in alphabet C comes first then we have D Diesel and then all the non values in the middle we have petrol but it is not displayed because of the it can't show all the values here so it can also include other data frames such as HP so for that what we can do inside this list only will get HP ok and we have integrated one value extra so will include I will give 0 that is I don't want it to be a sending word now you can see this is same but HP 110 10 50 90 so it is not sorted okay so this is how I think sort there is one more function called describe cos theta2 dot describe so if we call this function what it will do it will give you all the description of the different columns so you can see the count how many elements of price are there then th you can see 1 3 3 6 of 1 3 3 6 elements are there in each column like that and then for me it gives you the mean average of the price then for age that way it gives for all the columns then it gives standard deviation for all the columns then minimum number of minimum value in a particular column to use then it will give you about 25% 50% and 75% value of all the columns then it will give you maximum value of all the columns so this is this comes have up this comes in handy if you are not going to find standard deviation or minimum value or main value and one more thing you can export to other format also so if you want to format like cos theta2 dot we had gone to CSV we can do also to excel or proof text but for that also we use CSV can you see se for converting into text file so we'll give this name as modified dot txt the separator is voltage so we'll use tab and do you want to use index so I will kill index equal to false and we can check by using last at least today I have and you can see modified but tht is created how to do the aggregate statistics now that is using group by function so first for that first what we will do is will input data like this with filtered CSV into the new data frame and we can do that is in read CSV function of pandas latterly inside that will pass the name of the file in our case it is filter dot CSV and what we can do is we'll send comp so what we can do is field based on date of a beer cos theta 3 inside that will create a new column so you can just give it here temporarily it's count equal to 1 and now what we can do we can use already tough rain dot will call group I function and inside that we want to give the two columns on which you want to do the grouping so earlier I had shown you if you type NHP so on those we can group by so type then we'll pass this is a list so it is not the slicing operator it is released so thank you the next column that is HP and after that after group by what we can do Williams count function to counted wrong number of values and we'll set that value inside the count column now if you run this how many have to close this if you run this now you can see it is giving the insult value so favorite type in HP so it is group ID on CNG so how many HP are there on trend 10 so how many values are there 15 number of values are of CNG type and HP is hundred and ten in diesel fear death over here HP is 69 for 31 cars for 72 HP we have 69 cars and one car has 73 like that we are given and for petrol we can see 296 cars are of 86 HP so by this you can get greater insight using group by function so this works same as in the way we do the SQL queries if you have tried SQL queries this would be very easy for you to understand you can give any other column here you can give more than one column also so this is how you can use a grim statistics for grouping two or more columns
