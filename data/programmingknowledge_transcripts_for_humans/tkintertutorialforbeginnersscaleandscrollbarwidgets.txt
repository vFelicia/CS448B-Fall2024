00:00 - hey everyone we have covered almost all
00:03 - the visits in thinker we are left with a
00:05 - few so let's just take a look at them we
00:08 - will discuss the scale scroll bar list
00:10 - box and spin box they are very easy to
00:13 - understand and there is nothing complex
00:15 - about them so I'll just get all these
00:18 - widgets on the same screen and let's
00:20 - start writing the code
00:22 - I'll write
00:24 - from thinker
00:27 - inboard star you don't need to import
00:30 - any separate modules for these then I'll
00:33 - have my screen I'll write when equals TK
00:37 - and then I'll given a title I'll write
00:39 - win dot title
00:43 - and let title be scroll
00:48 - so I'll add my first widget I'll give
00:51 - the name scale
00:53 - have the variable scale
00:55 - equal scale that's my widget
00:59 - so it is like a slider that lets you
01:01 - pick a value and it has two methods get
01:04 - unset so let's just give the options for
01:07 - this where do I want the scale I want it
01:09 - on my window so I'll write when
01:13 - and you have this from N2 to specify the
01:17 - range of this slider
01:19 - so I'll write from equals zero
01:24 - two hundred
01:27 - okay
01:28 - I'll give in a background I'll give it
01:30 - to be light yellow
01:33 - then a foreground
01:36 - let it be black
01:40 - you can give an orientation for vertical
01:44 - and horizontal so I'll give an Orient
01:46 - equals horizontal
01:54 - then I'll given a label so let the label
01:57 - be scale widget
02:04 - there are many more options like the
02:07 - trough color the slider relief the kind
02:09 - of slider you want you can give it a
02:12 - command you can have a font description
02:14 - you can have
02:17 - resolution you have slider length you
02:20 - can specify the length of the slider
02:21 - then you can specify the state of it you
02:24 - can have the cursor then the Border
02:27 - Etc so
02:29 - you have given enough options and let's
02:32 - start this widget I'll write scale dot
02:35 - pack
02:36 - cool now I'll go to the spin box I'll
02:40 - write spin box
02:42 - equals spin box
02:46 - and for the arguments I'll give Master
02:49 - equals win
02:52 - again we have from N2 so from 0 to 10
03:00 - you can also given a negative number for
03:02 - from you can start from a negative
03:04 - number you can go to a negative from
03:06 - number but there should be a difference
03:08 - there should be a positive difference
03:09 - between them
03:11 - so you can given accordingly the range
03:14 - but we will do it from zero
03:18 - and then I'll give in a background color
03:20 - I'll write PG
03:22 - equals
03:23 - light gray
03:27 - FC equals
03:29 - Orange
03:34 - and
03:36 - let me give an a font I will give the
03:38 - font to be Ariel
03:40 - 12 italic it's just the number you can
03:44 - even not given the font
03:45 - for a spin box too we have a lot of
03:48 - options
03:50 - some are same as the scale widget but
03:53 - there are some things that are different
03:55 - so you have button up relief and button
03:58 - down relief
03:59 - then you have this increment parameter
04:02 - it can be a float
04:04 - then you have this x scroll command
04:06 - option so you can given a command that
04:09 - you want to take place when you scroll
04:11 - through the values
04:12 - that is when you increment or decrement
04:15 - the
04:15 - numbers in the spin box
04:19 - and I'm done with the widget so I'll
04:21 - pack this I'll write spinbox dot back
04:25 - then I'll go on to the scroll bar
04:27 - I'll write scroll bar
04:30 - equals scroll bar
04:34 - so for argument I have win as master
04:39 - so let's just keep the scroll bar simple
04:41 - it'll just stick upper side and I'll
04:45 - pack the scroll bar I'll write scroll
04:47 - bar dot pack
04:49 - side equals right
04:56 - fill equals y
04:59 - so I'll pack this at the right side of
05:01 - the screen and I want to fill
05:03 - the y-axis completely with the scroll
05:06 - bar okay
05:08 - then I'll get my list
05:11 - so I'll have this variable list
05:14 - equals list box this is another widget
05:18 - and when as master
05:22 - now what I want to do is I want to
05:24 - scroll through the list as I move my
05:27 - scroll bar so I'll write y scroll
05:29 - command
05:30 - equals scroll bar dot set
05:34 - so
05:35 - I'll set the values according to this
05:37 - wire scroll command okay
05:39 - now I'll also give in a font I'll give
05:41 - it to be Georgia 20. it's for the list
05:44 - okay
05:46 - and I'll have the background color to be
05:49 - sky blue
05:52 - now there are many methods associated
05:55 - with the list box widget to insert the
05:58 - values in a list box we would use the
06:01 - insert method so what I'll do is I'll
06:04 - write for I in range 51
06:07 - I'll just make a list with 51 lines I'll
06:11 - write list dot insert
06:15 - end so I need to give in the index
06:20 - and end word represent the point
06:23 - immediately after the last character
06:25 - entered by the user so and for the index
06:29 - and
06:32 - for the element I'll write string I
06:36 - Plus
06:37 - thought
06:40 - we are checking
06:44 - the list
06:46 - and scroll bar
06:49 - together
06:50 - okay
06:52 - now outside the for Loop I'll pack this
06:54 - widget I'll write list dot pack
06:58 - side equals right
07:00 - fill equals y
07:03 - expand equals true
07:05 - okay so that'll give me a good format
07:09 - now I want to configure the scroll bar
07:12 - again because I want to add the list to
07:13 - it okay so I'll write scroll bar dot
07:17 - config we have already discussed the use
07:19 - of config
07:20 - config is basically for overloading
07:23 - and I'll write in the argument command
07:27 - equals
07:29 - list dot y View
07:32 - okay
07:34 - so this tells the scroll bar that
07:36 - whenever the scroll bar is scroll
07:39 - through the list should also move along
07:42 - the wire view okay the y-axis now I can
07:45 - call the main Loop I'll write win Dot
07:49 - main Loop
07:51 - and let's just run this and check out
07:54 - all our widgets if they're working
07:56 - together and working properly as we have
07:58 - arranged them
08:02 - so I have my scale widget and you can
08:06 - see how this bar moves and gives us
08:09 - values
08:10 - then you have your spin box you can
08:13 - increase the value first and then
08:14 - decrease it
08:16 - but the values will only go from 0 to
08:19 - 10.
08:20 - we also have the scroll bar this thin
08:23 - line along
08:24 - the right of the screen and as you
08:28 - scroll
08:29 - As you move this scroll bar you can see
08:32 - the list moving up and down along this
08:35 - we have the list elements as we
08:37 - specified them and that's pretty much it
08:40 - for this video I hope you understood the
08:43 - widgets
08:45 - thank you

hey everyone we have covered almost all the visits in thinker we are left with a few so let's just take a look at them we will discuss the scale scroll bar list box and spin box they are very easy to understand and there is nothing complex about them so I'll just get all these widgets on the same screen and let's start writing the code I'll write from thinker inboard star you don't need to import any separate modules for these then I'll have my screen I'll write when equals TK and then I'll given a title I'll write win dot title and let title be scroll so I'll add my first widget I'll give the name scale have the variable scale equal scale that's my widget so it is like a slider that lets you pick a value and it has two methods get unset so let's just give the options for this where do I want the scale I want it on my window so I'll write when and you have this from N2 to specify the range of this slider so I'll write from equals zero two hundred okay I'll give in a background I'll give it to be light yellow then a foreground let it be black you can give an orientation for vertical and horizontal so I'll give an Orient equals horizontal then I'll given a label so let the label be scale widget there are many more options like the trough color the slider relief the kind of slider you want you can give it a command you can have a font description you can have resolution you have slider length you can specify the length of the slider then you can specify the state of it you can have the cursor then the Border Etc so you have given enough options and let's start this widget I'll write scale dot pack cool now I'll go to the spin box I'll write spin box equals spin box and for the arguments I'll give Master equals win again we have from N2 so from 0 to 10 you can also given a negative number for from you can start from a negative number you can go to a negative from number but there should be a difference there should be a positive difference between them so you can given accordingly the range but we will do it from zero and then I'll give in a background color I'll write PG equals light gray FC equals Orange and let me give an a font I will give the font to be Ariel 12 italic it's just the number you can even not given the font for a spin box too we have a lot of options some are same as the scale widget but there are some things that are different so you have button up relief and button down relief then you have this increment parameter it can be a float then you have this x scroll command option so you can given a command that you want to take place when you scroll through the values that is when you increment or decrement the numbers in the spin box and I'm done with the widget so I'll pack this I'll write spinbox dot back then I'll go on to the scroll bar I'll write scroll bar equals scroll bar so for argument I have win as master so let's just keep the scroll bar simple it'll just stick upper side and I'll pack the scroll bar I'll write scroll bar dot pack side equals right fill equals y so I'll pack this at the right side of the screen and I want to fill the yaxis completely with the scroll bar okay then I'll get my list so I'll have this variable list equals list box this is another widget and when as master now what I want to do is I want to scroll through the list as I move my scroll bar so I'll write y scroll command equals scroll bar dot set so I'll set the values according to this wire scroll command okay now I'll also give in a font I'll give it to be Georgia 20. it's for the list okay and I'll have the

and for the index and for the element I'll write string I Plus thought we are checking the list and scroll bar together okay now outside the for Loop I'll pack this widget I'll write list dot pack side equals right fill equals y expand equals true okay so that'll give me a good format now I want to configure the scroll bar again because I want to add the list to it okay so I'll write scroll bar dot config we have already discussed the use of config config is basically for overloading and I'll write in the argument command equals list dot y View okay so this tells the scroll bar that whenever the scroll bar is scroll through the list should also move along the wire view okay the yaxis now I can call the main Loop I'll write win Dot main Loop and let's just run this and check out all our widgets if they're working together and working properly as we have arranged them so I have my scale widget and you can see how this bar moves and gives us values then you have your spin box you can
