00:01 - hello welcome back to the another video
00:03 - of the JavaScript Java tutorial series
00:05 - uh so I guess this is the right time to
00:08 - begin our project
00:10 - our project number one is a simple
00:11 - banking application
00:13 - okay so till now we have covered only
00:16 - the loops uh some basic basic concepts
00:19 - of the Java and we are not right now uh
00:22 - Deep dive into the oops concept and that
00:25 - we will be doing after this project once
00:28 - we complete this project so uh this
00:31 - project is simply a console based
00:33 - project uh so no GUI interaction will be
00:36 - there in this project once we move into
00:38 - the advanced section of the Java where
00:41 - we'll be seeing some Java applets or
00:44 - swing there we can convert this project
00:46 - into the GUI based project okay so for
00:49 - till now uh I will be doing all this
00:53 - stuffs inside the console okay so for
00:56 - this I have plan what I have planned I
00:58 - will write down the points 0 over here
01:00 - so first we will display a
01:04 - one welcome welcome message to the user
01:06 - okay
01:07 - welcome
01:09 - message
01:11 - to user okay so that is how the first
01:13 - first goal okay
01:16 - and okay and then
01:18 - let me just get here
01:21 - okay for second number
01:24 - uh
01:28 - I can will be looking into the give me a
01:33 - we are giving five options to the user
01:35 - okay so first option will be uh
01:37 - something known as deposit
01:41 - where user can deposit the money inside
01:45 - this bank account okay and then
01:49 - after that
01:50 - the third option second option will be
01:54 - something known as withdraw
01:58 - okay where user can withdraw the money
02:00 - from his account okay then the third uh
02:04 - feature we will be carrying is get
02:11 - previous
02:16 - transactions okay so here in this
02:19 - feature a user will get to know what
02:22 - what is this previous transactions what
02:25 - you have done
02:27 - in the past transaction okay and uh
02:29 - again one more feature is there that is
02:33 - not not a feature it it basically uh
02:37 - your menu which shows to the user okay
02:39 - so here we are showing the menu to the
02:42 - user according to that by seeing that
02:44 - when new user will give import to our
02:45 - program and programs will behave
02:47 - according to that input okay
02:50 - show when
02:51 - today you said okay and uh at last
02:55 - we will
02:56 - execute
02:59 - execute our
03:02 - code
03:03 - okay so these are some steps that we
03:06 - will be following uh following inside
03:07 - this project
03:09 - okay at first user came and see the
03:12 - welcome message okay and then uh based
03:16 - on the user input we'll be performing
03:18 - some
03:19 - functions okay that is deposit withdraw
03:22 - get previous and reaction show the menu
03:23 - and execute our code okay so I hope you
03:26 - understand the only of the project and
03:29 - in our upcoming videos we will be seeing
03:31 - into the these one one by one
03:35 - implementing this functionality in our
03:37 - projects and at last as a sixth point we
03:39 - will execute our code okay so thank you
03:41 - for watching this video and I will see
03:43 - in the next one
