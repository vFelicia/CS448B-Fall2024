00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last two videos we have seen how to use
00:04 - basic functions and how to use functions
00:07 - with arguments and in this video I'm
00:10 - going to show you how to use a function
00:13 - that returns some value okay so for
00:16 - example I want uh to perform some more
00:21 - actions on the basis of the result of my
00:24 - function so for example I have this um
00:29 - these two numbers which I can add using
00:32 - this add function which I have shown you
00:34 - in the last video right so I can add two
00:37 - numbers but I want to somehow use this
00:41 - that result and I want to uh perform
00:44 - some more task with the result of this
00:47 - function how can I do it for
00:50 - example I want to
00:53 - add these two numbers 899 and 1,000 for
00:57 - example so add 89 9 +
01:03 - 1,000 and I want to multiply this this
01:08 - number which is a result by the addition
01:12 - of these two numbers right by the
01:15 - addition
01:16 - of these two numbers so how can I do
01:22 - this if I use the simple uh function
01:27 - with the argument I cannot achieve this
01:30 - and why I cannot achieve this because if
01:34 - you just uh want to Echo these numbers
01:38 - you don't uh have a result right unless
01:41 - and unless you you have some variable
01:43 - and you save that this uh somewhere
01:46 - right so I want to achieve something
01:48 - like this I want to add these two
01:49 - numbers using this add function and add
01:52 - these two number using this function but
01:54 - I also want the product of this I cannot
01:57 - do something like this this multiplied
02:01 - or multiplied by this and for that so
02:06 - this is not valid right so for that what
02:09 - I need to do is I need to return a value
02:12 - and store it in some variable and then
02:16 - do the performance or do some some kind
02:19 - of operation like this so let's see how
02:23 - we can do it I will just delete it and
02:28 - so we are adding these two numbers
02:29 - numbers but I want to the value of the
02:33 - result so that I can perform further
02:35 - actions so what I can do is I can uh
02:39 - declare one more variable
02:41 - called result is equal
02:45 - to
02:47 - result is equal to number one and number
02:50 - two right now this has the value of the
02:54 - result and somehow I want to get the
02:57 - value of this result uh in the case of
03:00 - this and in the case of this so what I
03:02 - can do is I can return this
03:07 - result return result so that I can store
03:12 - this result in some other variable and I
03:14 - can perform some action
03:17 - right so now it's returning something so
03:21 - how how can we achieve this kind of a
03:24 - goal what we can do is we can have for
03:31 - example a variable
03:34 - called uh add
03:37 - one is equal to which gives the addition
03:41 - of this these two numbers 8.99 and th000
03:46 - okay and what this return is doing here
03:49 - is it's taking 899 here 1,000 here it
03:54 - adds this these two numbers and whatever
03:58 - result it's
04:01 - returning from this function so what
04:04 - this will do here is it's returning the
04:07 - sum of these two numbers and it will
04:10 - assign this result in this add one
04:13 - variable in a similar way I can declare
04:18 - a second variable which will add my
04:20 - these two numbers so for example
04:24 - 2, and
04:26 - 1100
04:28 - okay
04:30 - okay now I want the product of these two
04:33 - numbers so what I can do I can simply
04:37 - echo echo the product of add one because
04:41 - it has the result of addition of these
04:43 - two add one
04:46 - multiplied by add two and basically I
04:51 - get the result like this okay so by
04:54 - returning the value you can assign your
04:57 - result in some other Val variable like
05:00 - this okay I will save it
05:04 - and
05:06 - basically let's Echo this also Echo this
05:11 - addition I want to Echo addition
05:15 - one and with a
05:21 - break BR and I want to Echo addition two
05:27 - also with a break but the parameters
05:31 - will be this so we know that the
05:34 - addition of these two number is what an
05:36 - addition of these two numers what and
05:38 - then I want to print the product okay
05:40 - save it and I will run
05:43 - this and there is some mistake somewhere
05:46 - let's see
05:48 - where so yes I forgot this dollar symbol
05:55 - here okay now it should run
06:00 - and I don't need to give any spaces here
06:03 - right and now I will run and you see the
06:07 - addition of
06:09 - 1,899 is 1899 addition of 2, 11100
06:15 - is 1100 is 3100 and product of 899 and
06:22 - 3100 is this one right so in this way
06:26 - you can return value using function and
06:29 - assign it to the other variables and do
06:31 - some other task with it so I hope you
06:35 - have understood the concept of return in
06:38 - functions I hope you have enjoyed this

06:41 - and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in the last two videos we have seen how to use basic functions and how to use functions with arguments and in this video I'm going to show you how to use a function that returns some value okay so for example I want uh to perform some more actions on the basis of the result of my function so for example I have this um these two numbers which I can add using this add function which I have shown you in the last video right so I can add two numbers but I want to somehow use this that result and I want to uh perform some more task with the result of this function how can I do it for example I want to add these two numbers 899 and 1,000 for example so add 89 9 + 1,000 and I want to multiply this this number which is a result by the addition of these two numbers right by the addition of these two numbers so how can I do this if I use the simple uh function with the argument I cannot achieve this and why I cannot achieve this because if you just uh want to Echo these numbers you don't uh have a result right unless and unless you you have some variable and you save that this uh somewhere right so I want to achieve something like this I want to add these two numbers using this add function and add these two number using this function but I also want the product of this I cannot do something like this this multiplied or multiplied by this and for that so this is not valid right so for that what I need to do is I need to return a value and store it in some variable and then do the performance or do some some kind of operation like this so let's see how we can do it I will just delete it and so we are adding these two numbers numbers but I want to the value of the result so that I can perform further actions so what I can do is I can uh declare one more variable called result is equal to result is equal to number one and number two right now this has the value of the result and somehow I want to get the value of this result uh in the case of this and in the case of this so what I can do is I can return this result return result so that I can store this result in some other variable and I can perform some action right so now it's returning something so how how can we achieve this kind of a goal what we can do is we can have for example a variable called uh add one is equal to which gives the addition of this these two numbers 8.99 and th000 okay and what this return is doing here is it's taking 899 here 1,000 here it adds this these two numbers and whatever result it's returning from this function so what this will do here is it's returning the sum of these two numbers and it will assign this result in this add one variable in a similar way I can declare a second variable which will add my these two numbers so for example 2, and 1100 okay okay now I want the product of these two numbers so what I can do I can simply echo echo the product of add one because it has the result of addition of these two add one multiplied by add two and basically I get the result like this okay so by returning the value you can assign your result in some other Val variable like this okay I will save it and basically let's Echo this also Echo this addition I want to Echo addition one and with a break BR and I want to Echo addition two also with a break but the parameters will be this so we know that the addition of these two number is what an addition of these two numers what and then I want to print the product okay save it and I will run this and there is some mistake somewhere let's see where so yes I forgot this dollar symbol here okay now it should run and I don't need to give any spaces here right and now I will run and you see the addition of 1,899 is 1899 addition of 2, 11100 is 1100 is 3100 and product of 899 and 3100 is this one right so in this way you can return value using function and assign it to the other variables and do some other task with it so I hope you have understood the concept of return in functions I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
