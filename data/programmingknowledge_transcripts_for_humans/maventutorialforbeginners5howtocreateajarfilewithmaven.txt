00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - maven tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how we can generate a
00:07 - jar file for our maven project so let's
00:11 - get started so let's say I have a
00:13 - colleague and I want to make a jar file
00:16 - and give it to him
00:18 - now in order to create a jar file from
00:22 - my maven project what steps I need to
00:25 - follow first of all I need to compile
00:28 - all my source file and then convert them
00:32 - into the dot class file so if you know
00:35 - whenever you compile our dot Java file
00:39 - it will result in a dot class file so
00:42 - you need to compile all your java files
00:45 - and then in the next step you need to
00:48 - compile all your test files ok and it
00:52 - will also result in the dot class files
00:56 - right now the third step is to run the
01:00 - test and if any test fails you need to
01:03 - work on them and correct them and unless
01:07 - and until you have zero errors in tests
01:10 - you need to you know rework on them
01:12 - right and the last step is to create a
01:16 - jar file which you can give to your
01:19 - colleagues ok so let's see how we can do
01:22 - it so I'm going to go to my Eclipse IDE
01:26 - and first of all what I'm going to do is
01:29 - I'm going to open the folder in which my
01:33 - maven project is so I'm going to right
01:36 - click and then go to the properties so
01:40 - once again I'm going to right click on
01:42 - my project and go to the properties here
01:44 - and in here you can just copy this
01:47 - location path from here and then go to
01:51 - your folder Explorer and then paste it
01:54 - there and then this will open your
01:57 - project in the you know Windows Explorer
02:01 - right so right now you can see it has
02:04 - the source folder and the target folder
02:08 - and your pom dot XML files right
02:13 - so the first step is to clean your
02:17 - project so you can see there is a target
02:21 - folder here and let's see what happens
02:24 - when we give the clean command but first
02:29 - of all I will go to my test source file
02:33 - here so AB test dot Java and in here
02:37 - there is a sample you know fill here
02:41 - right so I just want to remove it so
02:44 - that my test will not fail right we just
02:48 - want to you know compile our maven
02:51 - project and let's see how we can do it
02:53 - we are more interested in in the steps
02:56 - rather than in the code right so now I'm
03:01 - going to save it and now the command
03:04 - which I'm going to give here is to clean
03:08 - my project so just right click on your
03:11 - project and in here run as in the run as
03:15 - you have the bunch of maven commands
03:19 - here right
03:20 - you have maven build maven clean so you
03:24 - can give this maven clean command to
03:26 - clean your project right so the easy way
03:31 - is to just click this option maven build
03:34 - and in the goals you can just write
03:39 - clean here okay and it's same as writing
03:44 - ambient clean on the command line right
03:47 - and when I run this command what it does
03:51 - is I'm going to go to my folder Explorer
03:55 - once again and when this command will be
03:58 - successful you can see my target folder
04:01 - is deleted right so all the compiled
04:05 - files and all the jar files after
04:08 - compilation they are saved in this
04:11 - target folder and whenever we give the
04:14 - clean command it's going to clean all
04:17 - these compiled you know binaries and jar
04:21 - files ok so now our project is clean so
04:25 - you can see here
04:27 - in the output our build is successful
04:30 - the clean command and now we are ready
04:33 - to you know compile our app now the
04:38 - second command is to compile our source
04:42 - file right so once again right-click
04:45 - your project and run as and choose this
04:49 - option may even build with three dots
04:52 - and in the goals this time you need to
04:56 - give this compile command so in the
05:00 - goals I'm going to just write compile
05:02 - and this compile command is going to
05:06 - compile my source files and create our
05:09 - class files for us for the source files
05:12 - so let's run it and once our command is
05:19 - successfully run you can see build
05:22 - success here then we can once again go
05:25 - to our folder Explorer you can see once
05:28 - again the target folder is created
05:30 - inside the target folder we have this
05:33 - class folder then calm then code bind
05:37 - and then you have your app dot class
05:40 - file created by maven for you right now
05:45 - the third step is to compile your test
05:49 - files right so go to your project once
05:53 - again and right-click your project once
05:56 - again go to run as once again and then
05:59 - just click maven build with three dots
06:02 - once again and in the goals this time to
06:06 - run or to compile the test you just need
06:09 - to write test
06:11 - - compile ok and it's going to compile
06:16 - the test for you ok so just run this
06:20 - command and after this command is run
06:23 - successfully we are going to see the
06:26 - folder Explorer once again so build
06:29 - success once again let's go here and we
06:33 - will go to our project and in the target
06:36 - folder this time we have test - class
06:39 - folder 3
06:40 - inside the target folder and inside the
06:44 - you know code bind the package we have
06:47 - this test class created for you so app
06:50 - test dot class is created for you so we
06:54 - have compiled our source files and we
06:57 - have compiled our test files now we need
07:01 - to run the test so how to run the test
07:05 - you just need to right-click your
07:07 - project once again and then run as and
07:10 - then maven build with three dot once
07:14 - again and then this time you need to
07:17 - write test ok and it's same as giving
07:21 - the command mvn tests ok so just run
07:26 - this command test and let's see what's
07:29 - the result for us and we will wait for
07:35 - it and you can see the builds are
07:38 - success for this also right so now our
07:42 - tests are also passing in you know
07:47 - reality we don't even have any tests but
07:50 - let's say we have you know test cases
07:53 - and test suits for our classes that all
07:57 - our building successfully right once
08:00 - again we will go to our folder Explorer
08:02 - and go to the target folder and you can
08:06 - see there is a third folder created
08:08 - inside the target folder which is
08:11 - surefire reports and inside the Surefire
08:14 - reports you have a txt file and the XML
08:17 - file and when you open this text file is
08:20 - going to give you the result for the
08:24 - test so you can see test run one failure
08:28 - zero error zero skipped zero ok so we
08:32 - don't have any error inside our test ok
08:36 - so all the three steps are done our
08:41 - source files are compiled tests files
08:43 - are compiled and our tests are run
08:48 - successfully now in order to create a
08:51 - jar file there is a last comma
08:53 - we need to give here is just go to run
08:56 - as once again and then may even build
09:00 - you can directly click this maven
09:03 - install command for creating a jar file
09:06 - but since we are following this
09:08 - procedure of going to the maven build
09:11 - here with three dots here in the goals
09:15 - once again give the command install ok
09:19 - so just give the command install and
09:22 - then run it and once again your project
09:29 - will be compiled all the tests will be
09:32 - run and once you can see this build
09:36 - success you can go to the folder
09:38 - Explorer once again and go to the target
09:42 - once again and now you can see your jar
09:46 - file is created here right so the name
09:50 - of the char file as we have discussed
09:52 - earlier will be the name of your project
09:58 - for example your artefact ID then - your
10:04 - version zero point zero point one -
10:07 - snapshot dot is a jar file right so in
10:13 - this way you can create a jar file for
10:15 - your project now let's see how we can do
10:18 - the exact same steps using command line
10:22 - so that you know what are the command
10:25 - issued by Eclipse for creating these
10:28 - files so if you remember in the third
10:31 - video I have shown you how to create
10:34 - your first maven project using command
10:37 - line and we named our project as first
10:40 - maven project so I'm going to work on
10:43 - the same project for the command line
10:47 - right so just go inside this folder my
10:52 - first maven project and inside this
10:56 - folder you will be able to find your
10:59 - project name and inside this you have
11:03 - your source folder and
11:05 - the pom dot XML so just open the folder
11:09 - in which you have your source folder and
11:13 - pom dot XML file right because whenever
11:17 - we issue some command it's going to
11:19 - search for this pom dot XML file and the
11:22 - source folder and in here what you need
11:25 - to do is just press your shift key here
11:28 - so just press shift and then right click
11:31 - your mouse and you will be able to see
11:34 - this command open command window here
11:37 - okay and what it's going to do is I'm
11:40 - going to click this it's going to open
11:42 - the command prompt inside this folder so
11:45 - it will open this command prompt and the
11:48 - directory we are currently in is this
11:52 - directory in which you are in so we are
11:55 - in the my maven project here right now
12:00 - in here we are going to follow the same
12:02 - procedure we are going to give mvn clean
12:05 - command first to clean our project so
12:08 - just press enter and it's going to run
12:13 - this clean command and it says build
12:15 - success so it's going to clean our
12:19 - project right the second is to compile
12:23 - our project so just give me one compile
12:27 - so just write compile maven compile and
12:31 - press ENTER and it is going to compile
12:33 - all your source files right now the
12:37 - third step is to give the test compile
12:41 - you can see our maven compile is
12:44 - successful and it says build success
12:47 - here right so the third step is to may
12:50 - one test
12:52 - - compile here right so it is going to
12:56 - compile all our test files ok so press
12:59 - ENTER and it will run and compile all
13:03 - the test source file that says build
13:06 - success ok so you can see the target
13:09 - folder is created for us and inside this
13:12 - target folder we have the
13:14 - classes and inside the classes we have
13:17 - app class created for us same as we have
13:21 - seen in the case of Eclipse project
13:23 - right and we also have this test classes
13:26 - and then we have our app test or class
13:29 - created for us right now
13:33 - the fourth command was to run the test
13:38 - so ambien test you need to give mvn test
13:42 - to run your test to press ENTER and it's
13:45 - going to run all the tests and if they
13:48 - are successful then you will see build
13:50 - success here so our tests are run and
13:54 - it's going to create this surefire -
13:57 - report file and in this you can see we
14:00 - have zero failures
14:01 - zero errors right and the last command
14:05 - is to give here is MV and installed to
14:11 - create our jar file right so let's go
14:14 - inside the target and we will see the
14:17 - jar file er you know live created so
14:21 - let's give me when install and just see
14:27 - here what happens it will be generated
14:30 - right so maven install and press enter
14:33 - and it's going to compile all the things
14:37 - and run the tests and at the end our jar
14:41 - file is created here ok so in this way
14:45 - you can create a jar file you for your
14:48 - maven project I hope you enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video on maven tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can generate a jar file for our maven project so let's get started so let's say I have a colleague and I want to make a jar file and give it to him now in order to create a jar file from my maven project what steps I need to follow first of all I need to compile all my source file and then convert them into the dot class file so if you know whenever you compile our dot Java file it will result in a dot class file so you need to compile all your java files and then in the next step you need to

until you have zero errors in tests you need to you know rework on them right and the last step is to create a jar file which you can give to your colleagues ok so let's see how we can do it so I'm going to go to my Eclipse IDE and first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open the folder in which my maven project is so I'm going to right click and then go to the properties so once again I'm going to right click on my project and go to the properties here and in here you can just copy this location path from here and then go to your folder Explorer and then paste it there and then this will open your project in the you know Windows Explorer right so right now you can see it has the source folder and the target folder and your pom dot XML files right so the first step is to clean your project so you can see there is a target folder here and let's see what happens when we give the clean command but first of all I will go to my test source file here so AB test dot Java and in here there is a sample you know fill here right so I just want to remove it so that my test will not fail right we just want to you know compile our maven project and let's see how we can do it we are more interested in in the steps rather than in the code right so now I'm going to save it and now the command which I'm going to give here is to clean my project so just right click on your

it does is I'm going to go to my folder Explorer once again and when this command will be successful you can see my target folder is deleted right so all the compiled files and all the jar files after compilation they are saved in this target folder and whenever we give the clean command it's going to clean all these compiled you know binaries and jar files ok so now our project is clean so you can see here in the output our build is successful the clean command and now we are ready to you know compile our app now the second command is to compile our source file right so once again rightclick your project and run as and choose this option may even build with three dots and in the goals this time you need to give this compile command so in the goals I'm going to just write compile and this compile command is going to compile my source files and create our class files for us for the source files so let's run it and once our command is successfully run you can see build success here then we can once again go to our folder Explorer you can see once again the target folder is created inside the target folder we have this class folder then calm then code bind and then you have your app dot class file created by maven for you right now the third step is to compile your test files right so go to your project once again and rightclick your project once again go to run as once again and then just click maven build with three dots once again and in the goals this time to run or to compile the test you just need to write test compile ok and it's going to compile the test for you ok so just run this command and after this command is run successfully we are going to see the folder Explorer once again so build success once again let's go here and we will go to our project and in the target folder this time we have test class folder 3 inside the target folder and inside the you know code bind the package we have this test class created for you so app test dot class is created for you so we have compiled our source files and we have compiled our test files now we need to run the test so how to run the test you just need to rightclick your project once again and then run as and then maven build with three dot once again and then this time you need to write test ok and it's same as giving the command mvn tests ok so just run this command test and let's see what's the result for us and we will wait for it and you can see the builds are success for this also right so now our tests are also passing in you know reality we don't even have any tests but let's say we have you know test cases and test suits for our classes that all our building successfully right once again we will go to our folder Explorer and go to the target folder and you can see there is a third folder created inside the target folder which is surefire reports and inside the Surefire reports you have a txt file and the XML file and when you open this text file is going to give you the result for the test so you can see test run one failure zero error zero skipped zero ok so we don't have any error inside our test ok so all the three steps are done our source files are compiled tests files are compiled and our tests are run successfully now in order to create a jar file there is a last comma we need to give here is just go to run as once again and then may even build you can directly click this maven install command for creating a jar file but since we are following this procedure of going to the maven build here with three dots here in the goals once again give the command install ok so just give the command install and then run it and once again your project will be compiled all the tests will be run and once you can see this build success you can go to the folder Explorer once again and go to the target once again and now you can see your jar file is created here right so the name of the char file as we have discussed earlier will be the name of your project for example your artefact ID then your version zero point zero point one snapshot dot is a jar file right so in this way you can create a jar file for your project now let's see how we can do the exact same steps using command line so that you know what are the command issued by Eclipse for creating these files so if you remember in the third video I have shown you how to create your first maven project using command line and we named our project as first maven project so I'm going to work on the same project for the command line right so just go inside this folder my first maven project and inside this folder you will be able to find your project name and inside this you have your source folder and the pom dot XML so just open the folder in which you have your source folder and pom dot XML file right because whenever we issue some command it's going to search for this pom dot XML file and the source folder and in here what you need to do is just press your shift key here so just press shift and then right click your mouse and you will be able to see this command open command window here okay and what it's going to do is I'm going to click this it's going to open the command prompt inside this folder so it will open this command prompt and the directory we are currently in is this directory in which you are in so we are in the my maven project here right now in here we are going to follow the same procedure we are going to give mvn clean command first to clean our project so just press enter and it's going to run this clean command and it says build success so it's going to clean our project right the second is to compile our project so just give me one compile so just write compile maven compile and press ENTER and it is going to compile all your source files right now the third step is to give the test compile you can see our maven compile is successful and it says build success here right so the third step is to may one test compile here right so it is going to compile all our test files ok so press ENTER and it will run and compile all the test source file that says build success ok so you can see the target folder is created for us and inside this target folder we have the classes and inside the classes we have app class created for us same as we have seen in the case of Eclipse project right and we also have this test classes and then we have our app test or class created for us right now the fourth command was to run the test so ambien test you need to give mvn test to run your test to press ENTER and it's going to run all the tests and if they are successful then you will see build success here so our tests are run and it's going to create this surefire report file and in this you can see we have zero failures zero errors right and the last command is to give here is MV and installed to create our jar file right so let's go inside the target and we will see the jar file er you know live created so let's give me when install and just see here what happens it will be generated right so maven install and press enter and it's going to compile all the things and run the tests and at the end our jar file is created here ok so in this way you can create a jar file you for your maven project I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe
