00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to
00:04 - create a random number generating using
00:06 - your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:08 - application so what I will do is I will
00:10 - drag and drop a button in here and I
00:14 - will change the text of this button
00:17 - as random number
00:20 - generator and let me change the font of
00:24 - this
00:26 - button to a bigger font so you can see
00:30 - so now we are ready to write the code
00:33 - just double click this button and in
00:34 - here we are going to write the code to
00:36 - Generate random number generator first
00:39 - of all we will create a new object of
00:42 - the class random which is already there
00:46 - in your Visual Basic so what I will do
00:50 - is I'll create I will write dim
00:54 - RN
00:56 - as
00:58 - new
01:02 - random okay so this will create object
01:06 - of class random and for example I want
01:11 - to show or I want to generate this
01:13 - random number
01:15 - between a minimum and a maximum limit so
01:18 - for example I want to create this random
01:21 - number between 5 to 50 how can I do this
01:25 - uh I will show you so let me uh show
01:28 - this random number in a message box I
01:30 - will write messagebox do
01:35 - show and in between this message box
01:39 - argument I will write RN which is my
01:41 - random
01:43 - number object dot
01:47 - next and in here I will write two
01:51 - arguments in the next uh function so
01:55 - here I will write a minimum and maximum
01:57 - limit of the random number which I want
01:59 - to to generate so for example I want to
02:02 - generate a random number between 5 and
02:04 - 50 so I will write first argument as
02:06 - five and second argument as
02:10 - 50 and now when I run the
02:13 - program and when I click this random
02:16 - number generator it'll create uh random
02:20 - number between 5 to 50 so it created 33
02:24 - which is between 5 to 50
02:27 - 10 39 4 4 all the numbers are between 5
02:33 - to 50 and all the number are generated
02:36 - randomly and for example I want to
02:39 - generate a random number between 1,000
02:43 - to
02:45 - 10,000 and let's run the program once
02:48 - again and I
02:51 - will just click this button once again
02:55 - it generates a random number between
02:57 - 1,000 and
02:58 - 10,000 see it's generating every time
03:01 - different
03:03 - numbers so in this way you can create uh
03:06 - random number between any minimum and
03:10 - maximum limits and in this way you can
03:13 - use a random number generator you can
03:16 - use these random number generator
03:18 - generally in games when you want uh some
03:23 - function to perform randomly or create
03:26 - random
03:27 - number uh numers I hope you have
03:31 - understood the concept and so I will
03:35 - wrap up this video please write comment
03:37 - and subscribe and my

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to create a random number generating using your Visual Basic Windows Form application so what I will do is I will drag and drop a button in here and I will change the text of this button as random number generator and let me change the font of this button to a bigger font so you can see so now we are ready to write the code just double click this button and in here we are going to write the code to Generate random number generator first of all we will create a new object of the class random which is already there in your Visual Basic so what I will do is I'll create I will write dim RN as new random okay so this will create object of class random and for example I want to show or I want to generate this random number between a minimum and a maximum limit so for example I want to create this random number between 5 to 50 how can I do this uh I will show you so let me uh show this random number in a message box I will write messagebox do show and in between this message box argument I will write RN which is my random number object dot next and in here I will write two arguments in the next uh function so here I will write a minimum and maximum limit of the random number which I want to to generate so for example I want to generate a random number between 5 and 50 so I will write first argument as five and second argument as 50 and now when I run the program and when I click this random number generator it'll create uh random number between 5 to 50 so it created 33 which is between 5 to 50 10 39 4 4 all the numbers are between 5 to 50 and all the number are generated randomly and for example I want to generate a random number between 1,000 to 10,000 and let's run the program once again and I will just click this button once again it generates a random number between 1,000 and 10,000 see it's generating every time different numbers so in this way you can create uh random number between any minimum and maximum limits and in this way you can use a random number generator you can use these random number generator generally in games when you want uh some function to perform randomly or create random number uh numers I hope you have understood the concept and so I will wrap up this video please write comment and subscribe and my
