03:50 - some custom images uh into your
03:53 - dockerhub account and then you also need
03:56 - to pull those images so I already have
03:59 - the docker account so I'm going to click
04:01 - on sign in
04:03 - here and then I'm going to sign in with
04:06 - my Docker account and once I'm uh signed
04:09 - in with my Docker account I'm going to
04:10 - click allow here which is going to sign
04:13 - me in in my Docker desktop and here you
04:17 - can see this welcome survey I don't want
04:20 - to uh give any feedback so I'm going to
04:22 - click on skip survey here and now I can
04:25 - see my Docker
04:26 - desktop so let me just close every thing
04:30 - here and this is how this Docker desktop
04:33 - looks like on the top you can see the
04:36 - docker uh icon and you can also see that
04:39 - Docker desktop is running from here you
04:43 - can restart the docker quit Docker
04:45 - desktop also you can pause the docker
04:49 - right you can also see the images once
04:52 - you have some local images or if you

04:58 - Hub then you can also see those images
05:01 - here also you can see the volumes and
05:04 - other information about your Docker
05:08 - containers once that's done I'm going to
05:11 - minimize this and then I'm going to open
05:14 - the terminals so just go to your
05:16 - Spotlight and then just search for
05:18 - terminal and open the terminal and here
05:21 - we can just write Docker space version
05:26 - here and then press enter and it's going
05:28 - to give you some information
05:30 - about your Docker version you can also
05:33 - give this command which is Docker info
05:36 - and then press enter and it's going to
05:39 - give you the information about your
05:41 - Docker engine once those two commands uh
05:45 - works in your terminal you can also use
05:47 - Docker in your terminal so I'm going to
05:51 - uh clear the terminal and let's say I
05:54 - want to pull some image into my local
05:59 - machine
06:00 - so what you can do is you can search for
06:02 - dockerhub in your favorite browser and
06:06 - you can open this website which is hub.
06:09 - deer.com
06:10 - and once you are in this website you can
06:13 - search for popular Docker images so I'm
06:16 - going to search for hello world image
06:18 - which is the official image by Docker
06:23 - you can see here Docker official image
06:26 - this is the image which you can use to
06:28 - test whether Docker is working fine on
06:31 - your uh operating system or not and the
06:34 - command here is Docker pull hello world
06:37 - you can also copy this command by
06:39 - pressing on this copy button go to your
06:40 - terminal and then just write Docker pull
06:44 - hello world which is going to pull this
06:47 - uh Docker image which is the hello world
06:49 - image once this image is pulled you can
06:53 - check the local images by giving this
06:56 - command which is Docker images
06:59 - and then press enter you can see we have
07:02 - one image right now right so in order to
07:06 - run a container using this image you can
07:10 - give this command which is Docker and
07:13 - when you write Docker and then press Tab
07:16 - Key you will see what kind of commands
07:19 - are available which are associated with
07:22 - Docker right so once you install Docker
07:25 - it also comes with Docker compose
07:27 - command Docker command I have already
07:29 - shown you it also comes with Docker
07:31 - credential desktop and all other
07:34 - commands like this right so in order to
07:37 - run your uh Docker container just write
07:40 - Docker run and then the name of your
07:44 - image which is Hello World in our case
07:47 - so we are going to write this hello
07:50 - hyphen World here and then press enter
07:53 - it's going to give you this kind of
07:55 - output which says hello from Docker if
07:58 - you see this kind of output that means
08:00 - Docker is working fine on your Mac
08:03 - operating
08:04 - system once you pulled your images you
08:08 - can also go to your Docker desktop and
08:11 - check the images here so you can see now
08:14 - I have one local image I can run it from
08:18 - here itself and you can see right now
08:22 - it's in used so it's going to give you
08:25 - the status of Docker also you can also
08:28 - check your container ERS which are
08:30 - running so you can see uh this container
08:33 - we ran 42 seconds ago right you can run
08:36 - this container Again by clicking on the
08:39 - start button to check the containers
08:42 - using command line I can go to my uh
08:45 - terminal and here I can just give this
08:49 - command which is which is Docker PS
08:51 - command and it's going to give me uh the
08:54 - containers which are running right now
08:57 - there are no containers running so I
08:59 - don't see any container if some
09:02 - container is running you will be able to
09:04 - see the list of containers which are
09:06 - running here also if you want to see the
09:09 - list of all the containers which are
09:10 - running or not running you can give uh
09:14 - this command Docker PS with the flag
09:17 - hyphen a and then press enter and it's
09:20 - going to give you the containers which
09:22 - you ran previously also right so this
09:26 - container is right now not running but
09:28 - we ran this container 2 minutes ago so
09:32 - this is how you can download and install
09:34 - Docker on your Mac operating system from
09:38 - now on you will be able to use Docker on
09:41 - your terminal or you can use the docker
09:44 - desktop for pulling or pushing the image
09:48 - into the docker Hub also right so that's
09:52 - it for this video I hope you've enjoyed
09:54 - this video and I will see you in the
09:56 - next
