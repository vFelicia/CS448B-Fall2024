00:00 - hey guys so Visual Studio IDE 2019 is
00:04 - officially released so in this video we
00:07 - are going to see how we can install
00:10 - Visual Studio IDE 2019 on our Windows
00:13 - operating system and in this process we
00:16 - will also feel how this Visual Studio
00:20 - IDE looks like and what are the new
00:24 - features available in the new Visual
00:27 - Studio IDE
00:28 - so first of all open your favorite
00:30 - browser and search for Visual Studio and
00:33 - here is the link which you need to click
00:36 - which is visual studio.net grow soft
00:39 - comm so we are going to click on this
00:41 - link and then on the left hand side you
00:44 - can see visual studio ide and you will
00:48 - see different versions available for
00:51 - download so for now we are going to
00:54 - download the community version so I'm
00:56 - going to just click on the community
00:58 - 2019 and the download will start
01:02 - hopefully in few seconds so you can see
01:05 - this vs underscore community dot exe
01:08 - file is not really big it's around 1.3
01:12 - megabyte but I think at the time of
01:15 - installation we need internet connection
01:18 - in order to install Visual Studio IDE so
01:21 - I'm going to click on the save file
01:23 - button and once this file is saved I'm
01:26 - just going to click on this Exe file
01:29 - this is the easy part and then I'm going
01:32 - to click on yes and I'm going to
01:35 - minimize the browser so here is the
01:37 - first step
01:38 - Visual Studio installer before you get
01:40 - started we need to setup few things so
01:43 - that you can configure your installation
01:45 - I will just click on continue and then I
01:48 - will wait for this process to be
01:50 - completed so it seems that installation
01:54 - of this first step is done and we are
01:58 - waiting for the next step and now we can
02:00 - see this kind of Visual Studio installer
02:03 - window so here in few seconds you will
02:05 - see this window where you need to choose
02:08 - the workloads so there are several
02:11 - workloads available here
02:13 - so depending upon your preferences you
02:16 - can choose these workloads so for now
02:19 - I'm going to choose the dotnet Desktop
02:22 - workload and the other workloads you can
02:26 - also download and install later so you
02:30 - don't need to choose each and every
02:32 - workload for now you can choose the
02:34 - workload you require at the moment and
02:38 - then later also you can install these
02:41 - workloads as you require them and you
02:45 - can see on the right hand side the total
02:48 - space required for the particular
02:51 - workload so for example I choose one
02:54 - more workload here for the node.js
02:57 - development also then this space
03:00 - requirement will be greater so I'm going
03:04 - to just choose this one for now which is
03:07 - dotnet desktop development workload and
03:11 - then I'm going to click on install and
03:13 - now I will wait for this process to be
03:16 - completed so this is around 4.5 gigabyte
03:21 - workload which is to be downloaded so
03:24 - this might take some time to download
03:27 - and install this workload by the
03:30 - meantime let's see what are the new
03:32 - features which are available on Visual
03:34 - Studio IDE 2019 so the first feature
03:38 - which is highlighted here is the
03:40 - one-click code cleanup so it will
03:43 - resolve warnings and suggestions with
03:46 - the click of the button so this feature
03:49 - I have also seen on Visual Studio code
03:53 - when you install certain plugin this
03:56 - feature is available on Visual Studio
03:58 - code also so I think this feature is
04:02 - really good when you need to resolve
04:05 - some issues related to styling or any
04:08 - other warnings or suggestions the second
04:11 - feature here is the Visual Studio a
04:14 - intially code so it gets AI assistant
04:18 - recommendations that learns from the
04:21 - community so this is the second feature
04:24 - and the third feature here is the Visual
04:26 - Studio
04:27 - live share so you can share your code at
04:31 - real time and collaborate on your
04:35 - development at real time with the other
04:38 - developer few more things I have read
04:40 - about Visual Studio 2019 is that it's a
04:45 - get first IDE that means the gate
04:49 - integration in Visual Studio 2019
04:52 - is really good you might have heard the
04:55 - excuse that Microsoft has acquired
04:58 - github and this might be the consequence
05:03 - of this acquisition I think that now
05:07 - Visual Studio 2019 is get first IDE so
05:11 - that you can make your pull request
05:14 - using this IDE itself and I suppose
05:18 - there will be more github related
05:21 - integration inside your Visual Studio
05:24 - IDE the next thing I have heard about
05:27 - Visual Studio 2019 is its look and feel
05:31 - is now more closer to Visual Studio code
05:36 - look and feel and also the font styles
05:39 - are also closer to the visual studio
05:43 - code Visual Studio code is a code editor
05:46 - from Microsoft which is an open source
05:49 - cross-platform editor which is really
05:53 - versatile and I really like it so if
05:56 - this look and feel comes to Visual
05:58 - Studio IDE
06:00 - I think it's a really good step and when
06:03 - you scroll down in this page you can see
06:06 - this link which says learn more about
06:08 - Visual Studio 2019 I'm going to click on
06:11 - this link and you will be able to find
06:14 - some more features of Visual Studio IDE
06:18 - 2019 so when I scroll down here you can
06:22 - see improved intellisense performance
06:25 - for C++ files local development with
06:28 - many common emulators and simplified
06:32 - test access in solution explorer gate
06:36 - management and repo creation in the IDE
06:40 - and kubernetes support so these are some
06:43 - of the new features which are available
06:45 - in Visual Studio 2019 so now the process
06:49 - of installation of workload has been
06:52 - finished and I can see this message
06:54 - which says reboot required success one
06:57 - more step to go please restart your
06:59 - computer before you start Visual Studio
07:01 - community 24 that I have to say that
07:07 - this process of installation of workload
07:10 - it was around 4.5 gb of data which has
07:14 - to be downloaded and then installed so
07:17 - it took around two hours on my pc so
07:21 - make sure that you have a considerable
07:25 - amount of time in order to install
07:27 - Visual Studio maybe it's my computer or
07:29 - maybe it's my internet connection it
07:32 - might be those reasons because of that
07:34 - it took a considerable amount of time
07:37 - and maybe in your case this process will
07:40 - be faster if you have faster internet
07:42 - and the good PC so now I'm going to
07:46 - restart my computer by just clicking on
07:48 - this restart button and then I will see
07:52 - you on the other side when I will
07:54 - restart my computer and restart Visual
07:58 - Studio community 2015 19 for the first
08:10 - time so I'm going to go to the
08:14 - installation location from where I can
08:17 - start Visual Studio 2019 I'm using
08:20 - Windows 8 by the way so that's why this
08:24 - looks like this if you are using Windows
08:27 - 10 you will be able to open this using
08:32 - this windows icon also so when you
08:34 - left-click then you will be able to see
08:38 - the visual studio icon there and you can
08:41 - see for the first time Visual Studio IDE
08:44 - looks like this when it starts and the
08:48 - first thing Visual Studio shows here is
08:51 - the welcome window and you will be
08:54 - encouraged to sign in with your
08:56 - Microsoft account or any kind of visual
09:01 - studio account and there is an option
09:05 - for not now maybe later also so let's
09:08 - click on this option which says not now
09:10 - maybe later and now we are going to
09:14 - choose the environment so this is new
09:19 - I'm seeing this for the first time for
09:22 - Visual Studio so start with a familiar
09:25 - environment development setting is
09:27 - general by default and there are these
09:31 - options whatever you want so I'm going
09:33 - to just say I want the general
09:36 - development settings and there are a few
09:39 - themes available here one is blue and
09:42 - other is blue extra contrast light dark
09:47 - I'm going to go with the normal blue
09:50 - which is the default one and then I'm
09:54 - going to just click on start Visual
09:57 - Studio so now I can see this window
09:59 - which says Visual Studio 2019 and on the
10:03 - left hand side I can see open recent I
10:06 - haven't opened anything this is for the
10:10 - first time I'm opening Visual Studio
10:11 - 2019 so this will look like this and on
10:15 - the right hand side I can see clone or
10:17 - check out or open a project or solution
10:21 - open a local folder or create a new
10:25 - project and there is an option for
10:27 - continue without code so I'm going to
10:31 - just click on this option which says
10:33 - continue without code and it's going to
10:36 - open this Visual Studio IDE for the
10:40 - first time so you can see this is going
10:43 - to look like this
10:44 - so let's try to create a new project so
10:46 - I'm going to try to create a project
10:50 - using the method which I know so I
10:53 - always go to the file option and from
10:57 - here I choose new and then project and
11:00 - here you will be able to choose the type
11:04 - of projects
11:05 - so I'm going to go with Windows forum
11:08 - app which is using dotnet framework and
11:12 - I also can see some new looking window
11:18 - here so this window in the previous
11:22 - version of Visual Studio it doesn't look
11:24 - like this right
11:25 - and also the language options I can
11:28 - choose directly from here so let's say I
11:31 - want to choose a c-sharp from here so
11:33 - it's going to only show the c-sharp
11:36 - options or I can also choose the C++
11:40 - options which are not available because
11:43 - I haven't installed those options so
11:46 - let's choose the default which is all
11:49 - languages and then choose windows form
11:52 - app and then click on next and this will
11:56 - be the name of your project so I'm going
11:58 - to leave it as default which is Windows
12:00 - from app 1 and this will be the location
12:03 - where Visual Studio will save this
12:07 - project by default so I'm going to leave
12:10 - everything as default for now and then
12:13 - I'm going to just click on create so now
12:16 - I can see this project has been created
12:19 - so just to check if everything is
12:22 - working fine I'm going to just click on
12:25 - this start button which is going to
12:27 - build this application and run it on my
12:31 - PC so now this form is open that means
12:37 - our project has been compiled
12:39 - successfully and it's running so
12:42 - everything is working fine after the
12:45 - installation so this is how you can
12:48 - install Visual Studio 2019 on your
12:52 - Windows operating system
12:54 - I have only installed the dotnet
12:56 - workload but you can also install any
12:59 - other workload whatever you want at any
13:02 - time so there are applications which you
13:06 - can develop for example if you want to
13:08 - develop node.js or C++ application or
13:11 - Python application or any other
13:13 - application which you want to develop
13:16 - using Visual Studio you can install the
13:19 - workload for that and then you will be
13:21 - able to develop those applications in
13:24 - your Visual Studio 2019 IDE so I hope
13:29 - you have enjoyed the installation
13:32 - process of Visual Studio 2019 and I will
13:36 - see you in some other video so see you
13:40 - later

the gate integration in Visual Studio 2019 is really good you might have heard the excuse that Microsoft has acquired github and this might be the consequence of this acquisition I think that now Visual Studio 2019 is get first IDE so that you can make your pull request using this IDE itself and I suppose there will be more github related integration inside your Visual Studio IDE the next thing I have heard about Visual Studio 2019 is its look and feel is now more closer to Visual Studio code look and feel and also the font styles are also closer to the visual studio code Visual Studio code is a code editor from Microsoft which is an open source crossplatform editor which is really versatile and I really like it so if this look and feel comes to Visual Studio IDE I think it's a really good step and when you scroll down in this page you can see this link which says learn more about Visual Studio 2019 I'm going to click on this link and you will be able to find some more features of Visual Studio IDE 2019 so when I scroll down here you can see improved intellisense performance for C++ files local development with many common emulators and simplified test access in

of workload has been finished and I can see this message which says reboot required success one more step to go please restart your computer before you start Visual Studio community 24 that I have to say that this process of installation of workload it was around 4.5 gb of data which has to be downloaded and then installed so it took around two hours on my pc so make sure that you have a considerable amount of time in order to install Visual Studio maybe it's my computer or maybe it's my internet connection it might be those reasons because of that it took a considerable amount of time and maybe in your case this process will be faster if you have faster internet and the good PC so now I'm going to restart my computer by just clicking on this restart button and then I will see you on the other side when I will restart my computer and restart Visual Studio community 2015 19 for the first time so I'm going to go to the installation location from where I can start Visual Studio 2019 I'm using Windows 8 by the way so that's why this looks like this if you are using Windows 10 you will be able to open this using this windows icon also so when you leftclick then you will be able to see the visual studio icon there and you can see for the first time Visual Studio IDE looks like this when it starts and the first thing Visual Studio shows here is the welcome window and you will be encouraged to sign in with your Microsoft account or any kind of visual studio account and there is an option for not now maybe later also so let's click on this option which says not now

Windows forum app which is using dotnet framework and I also can see some new looking window here so this window in the previous version of Visual Studio it doesn't look like this right and also the language options I can choose directly from here so let's say I want to choose a csharp from here so it's going to only show the csharp options or I can also choose the C++ options which are not available because I haven't installed those options so let's choose the default which is all languages and then choose windows form app and then click on next and this will be the name of your project so I'm going to leave it as default which is Windows from app 1 and this will be the location where Visual Studio will save this project by default so I'm going to leave everything as default for now and then I'm going to just click on create so now I can see this project has been created so just to check if everything is working fine I'm going to just click on this start button which is going to build this application and run it on my PC so now this form is open that means our project has been compiled successfully and it's running so everything is working fine after the installation so this is how you can install Visual Studio 2019 on your Windows operating system I have only installed the dotnet workload but you can also install any other workload whatever you want at any time so there are applications which you can develop for example if you want to develop node.js or C++ application or Python application or any other application which you want to develop using Visual Studio you can install the workload for that and then you will be able to develop those applications in your Visual Studio 2019 IDE so I hope you have enjoyed the installation process of Visual Studio 2019 and I will see you in some other video so see you later
