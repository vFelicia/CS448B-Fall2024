00:10 - basically Ubuntu
00:12 - and we will see the basic Comfort
00:13 - concept of virtualbox what is virtualbox
00:15 - and why we will use it okay so let's
00:18 - start with the virtual box so virtualbox
00:20 - is nothing but one kind of software that
00:23 - we use to run different operating system
00:25 - in our main host okay
00:27 - so our main host here means that our one
00:29 - this operating system that that this one
00:31 - which I am using right now that is
00:33 - Windows 11 okay so in this operating
00:35 - system we are going to use another
00:37 - operating system with the help of
00:39 - virtualbox okay I hope that is clear to
00:41 - you like what is a virtualbox
00:43 - okay so basically we will uh
00:46 - install Ubuntu OS but before that you
00:49 - will need to first of all install
00:50 - virtualbox so how you can do it you have
00:53 - to just go on this particular website
00:54 - virtualbox.org
00:57 - and you have to click on this download
00:58 - virtualbox 6.1 and then according to
01:01 - your host you can download it if I hope
01:03 - it's windows

11:17 - different for the windows users uh like
11:19 - who are using Windows from his childhood
11:22 - or our childhood
11:24 - okay
11:26 - so this will be basically some kind of
11:28 - command line based thing so as you will
11:30 - get some real-time skills okay
11:33 - like that will be helpful in the
11:35 - corporate also
11:37 - or if you want to go in the domain of
11:40 - cyber security there is also need of
11:43 - this Linux OS so that would be very
11:46 - helpful for you
11:48 - so uh
11:50 - let it installer I will be right back
11:53 - after the complete installation
12:03 - so now you can see guys like now it will
12:06 - install
12:07 - [Music]
12:08 - as there was uh some kind of packages it
12:12 - so it was installing uh just before
12:15 - I resume the video
12:17 - [Music]
12:19 - now it should not take much time it will
12:22 - take I think a little bit of time
12:25 - it will just though whatever the package
12:27 - that has installed by the system then it
12:30 - will just unpack all the all those
12:32 - things
12:42 - so let's wait for it don't know how much
12:45 - time will it take
12:48 - foreign
12:52 - [Music]
12:57 - Linux headers
13:00 - okay nice
13:02 - [Music]
13:12 - it should not take much time I don't
13:14 - know why it's taking much time
13:17 - packingness headers so
13:34 - okay preparing now it's preparing
13:45 - [Music]
13:52 - so guys now you can see our installation
13:54 - has been completed and this is the like
13:57 - information box you will get after the
13:59 - com after the successful installation
14:00 - now it's asking to restart now so I'll
14:04 - just hit on restart now
14:15 - then it will ask for the whatever the
14:18 - username and the password which you have
14:19 - entered at the time installation then
14:21 - that those things you will need to enter
14:22 - okay so it is asking for the removing
14:25 - solution because okay I have to just hit
14:27 - enter so you will also need to hit enter
14:30 - okay so now it wouldn't start
14:35 - and after that uh I will tell you
14:38 - something
14:39 - important uh
14:42 - like as you can see over the this size
14:45 - of that particular schema is only too
14:47 - much uh but uh
14:49 - I know like we don't like to do on like
14:52 - the small window
14:54 - so we will check how we can increase the
14:56 - particular screen size to full screen
15:00 - okay
15:02 - so first of all we will need to login
15:04 - into the system then we will need to do
15:07 - some changes in it then we can easily uh
15:10 - go into the full screen mode
15:13 - foreign
15:20 - as compared to like uh old install
15:24 - system
15:27 - so let's wait for it

15:57 - username whatever you have entered so I
15:59 - had entered the name I use I will just
16:02 - click on it and I will need to just hit
16:04 - the password
16:07 - okay then hit enter
16:17 - it will take little bit of time
16:20 - to configure everything
16:23 - foreign
16:38 - system
16:45 - okay so it will ask for some kind of
16:48 - this thing if you want to link this with
16:50 - the Google account then you can go
16:51 - otherwise you can just skip it okay
16:54 - that's not mandatory to it to do it
16:57 - and then also click on next and if you
17:00 - want to install some kind of software
17:01 - into this Ubuntu OS then you can do it
17:03 - otherwise you can also click on done
17:05 - okay so now you can see uh this is our
17:09 - OS uh which is installed successfully
17:11 - but uh you can see the screen size is
17:14 - too small for the use okay so for that
17:17 - what we will need to do
17:19 - we will need to first of all uh like um
17:25 - let me do one thing I will just uh
17:30 - oh

17:57 - have to do it full to 128 MB and then
18:00 - you have to just enable the 3D
18:02 - acceleration and make sure your storage
18:04 - is it's showing empty but what we will
18:07 - know we will need to do just add optical
18:09 - drive and we will just add this one we
18:11 - both just addition.iso

19:12 - will need to wait
19:14 - okay

24:23 - ayush okay so that's all for today's
24:25 - videos guys I hope you have a
24:27 - successfully install the Linux operating
24:28 - system or you can so Ubuntu OS in your
24:31 - PC using virtualbox so that's all for
24:34 - today so do like share and subscribe
24:36 - programming knowledge and I'll meet you
24:39 - in the next video thank you thank you
24:40 - for watching so now here is our Linux
24:43 - system which we had already installed
24:45 - yesterday if you have not watched the
24:47 - previous video then please go and watch
24:49 - that video because without this uh you
24:51 - will not be able to follow us okay
24:53 - uh if you have already installed it it's
24:56 - fine if you have not installed then you
24:57 - can go for it okay
24:59 - so now what we have to do we have to
25:01 - first off uh learn the one of the basic
25:04 - command like LS command but before that
25:07 - you should have some familiarity with
25:09 - this uh like environment about Linux
25:12 - environment like here you can see the
25:13 - browser web browser mail here you can
25:16 - see the files that just like in our
25:19 - Windows system there is the this one
25:22 - file explorer similarly here is also
25:24 - that thing okay you can access the
25:26 - different folders documents
25:29 - and then downloads music whatever thing
25:32 - you will download from web browser it
25:34 - will get downloaded in this particular
25:35 - video uh in this particular sorry uh
25:38 - download for directory and here is some
25:41 - public folder
25:44 - and here is nothing okay
25:46 - and also you will get the trash videos
25:50 - pictures all these things okay
25:52 - so these are the all things which you
25:55 - will get
25:56 - so now what we have to do we you will
25:59 - you will need to first of all open up
26:01 - the terminal uh you can go from here and
26:05 - then you can click on Terminal okay but
26:08 - also there is a shortcut for opening the
26:11 - terminal is the control alt T okay
26:14 - so now I will cut this and you can just
26:16 - hit Ctrl alt and then
26:19 - so it will like open one of the terminal
26:22 - so this is our terminal and on this
26:26 - particular thing we will work
26:27 - so let me maximize it
26:31 - I hope it is visible to you
26:36 - okay straight amount
26:39 - [Music]
26:40 - uh
26:43 - okay now it should be visible to you
26:45 - guys okay so uh the First Command which
26:48 - we will uh learn about in this video is
26:51 - the ls command so what is LS command
26:53 - first we will talk about this what is LS
26:55 - command uh just think about LSS is
26:58 - nothing but the list the content so we
27:01 - use the ls command to list the contents
27:03 - of a particular directory okay
27:05 - if you are both you are in our desktop
27:08 - directory so you want to get the all
27:11 - what are the files what are the
27:13 - directors in that particular desktop if
27:15 - you want to get it so you will use a
27:17 - simple command that is called as LS
27:19 - command okay
27:20 - so what we will do we'll just hit LS
27:23 - okay
27:24 - so now I am in the home folder and where
27:27 - you can see the desktop documents
27:29 - downloads music pictures and all these
27:31 - things okay
27:32 - so what I will do for the purpose of
27:34 - showing you
27:36 - I will just open up the files in my here
27:42 - on my screen I will try to minimize it
27:46 - okay
27:48 - yeah
27:49 - here you can see I am already on the
27:52 - home directory okay from here you can
27:54 - see also
27:56 - uh I hope it's feasible
28:00 - let me minimize the size of this
28:02 - particular window
28:04 - and yeah
28:07 - now here you can see uh this is the home
28:09 - and the same content which we are
28:12 - getting also here okay so this is the uh
28:15 - main purpose of the command LS so this
28:19 - is the basic work which it does like it
28:22 - just list the content of that particular
28:25 - um folder or particular directory in
28:28 - which you are present so if I will go in
28:30 - the desktop and here you can see one
28:32 - file has been created desktop so now
28:35 - what we will do
28:37 - we will just here click on open it
28:40 - terminal okay
28:43 - and then now you can see where are you
28:45 - you are in the desktop now here when you
28:48 - will do LS
28:50 - so here also you can see you are getting
28:52 - that particular directory test as it is
28:55 - okay so I hope you got the idea about
28:58 - how the ls Works what are the main
28:59 - person purpose behind this okay
29:02 - so now what we will I will talk about
29:05 - with you is the slacks or you can see
29:09 - say the options or arguments so there
29:13 - are many options or arguments which we
29:16 - use with the ls command okay
29:19 - so I will use uh show you the first one
29:23 - is L hyphen L that is small l so this is
29:26 - the basically the format or you can say
29:28 - the Syntax for the like commands like
29:31 - there will be command name then hyphen
29:33 - then the whatever the option which you
29:35 - want to provide with it so what with
29:37 - this command will basically do hyphen L
29:39 - just stands for the long format okay it
29:42 - will show you the all the files and
29:44 - write in the long format
29:46 - so I will just hit enter and now you
29:49 - will learn a thing like wow what what is
29:52 - this now I will get a bit of confused
29:55 - about it okay so let me tell you about
29:57 - these things like
29:59 - these are these are the some permissions
30:01 - okay
30:03 - uh like read write execute uh there will
30:06 - be a separate video on this permission
30:08 - because this is a very important topic
30:10 - okay
30:10 - and then there is a user's new username
30:13 - group name this is the file size and the
30:16 - dates and all in the last modification
30:18 - date time so the I had created The One
30:23 - desktop folder at 153 am so that's why
30:26 - it is showing at uh this time 153 okay
30:30 - so now what I will do I will create one
30:34 - folder in documents okay
30:38 - and here I will do new folder and here I
30:41 - will give it the name as uh
30:44 - LS
30:46 - command okay
30:49 - here you can see the documents folder
30:51 - and in that we have a LS command now
30:54 - what I will do
30:55 - I will just again hit the LSI funnel
31:00 - here now you can see the last
31:03 - modification time of that particular uh
31:05 - directory document is 217 and here also
31:08 - you can say it's now r280 now okay I
31:11 - hope you got the idea about this hyphen
31:14 - L format like it basically displays you
31:16 - the result in the long format okay
31:20 - so this is the main purpose of this
31:23 - hyphen L flag now let me talk you uh
31:27 - about some other flags like H flag okay
31:31 - so H plug basically uh does the like it
31:35 - will show you the format in the human
31:37 - readable format okay like as you can see
31:40 - this is a 409 so you will not give what
31:42 - is this basically it is the file size
31:44 - okay
31:45 - and if I will do hyphen H then you will
31:48 - get us some difference uh let me create
31:51 - one more terminal so that you can
31:53 - differentiate between both the result
31:55 - okay
31:58 - how many eyes at uh
32:02 - okay my battery is low
32:08 - okay now what I will do here LS hyphen l
32:12 - hyphen H okay we can use the separate uh
32:17 - as a separate flag or we can just
32:19 - combine both together I will show you
32:22 - after this okay don't worry about it so
32:25 - here now you can see this is showing me
32:27 - the humidity formula what is 36 it is 36
32:30 - KB and then 4 kb4 kb4 KB this is the
32:33 - size of all like directories there is a
32:37 - some basic concept about it I will tell
32:39 - you later uh in that particular video
32:41 - when we will come across with the more
32:43 - description about these things like it
32:45 - isn't basically related to the hard
32:47 - Links of soft link kind of concept in
32:49 - Linux okay so as this is a beginner
32:51 - purpose video so will not cover this at
32:54 - this time otherwise you will get
32:55 - confused okay
32:57 - so uh we I had used LS iPhone H okay so
33:01 - now what I will do
33:03 - I'll just combine both things okay
33:05 - hyphen LH
33:07 - as you can see there will be no
33:09 - difference and it will also know uh
33:11 - knows like it will also not provide me
33:13 - like this command is basically like on
33:16 - valid or anything else
33:17 - so you can see we can write like this
33:20 - also or we can write like this also
33:23 - so now uh one more command you will need
33:26 - to know the clear command
33:29 - what this phone will do I hope you guys
33:30 - did right this will just clear all this
33:33 - screen okay I will just hit enter and
33:36 - yeah boom you got clear okay
33:40 - now uh let's move about some other flags
33:44 - which we will use the simple flag is
33:46 - also the a slab what it does you will uh
33:51 - will understand like it will list all
33:53 - the files and directory okay uh the
33:56 - hidden files also it will show us and
33:59 - here you can see we are getting the
34:00 - biggest bash history logout Dash RC file
34:03 - all these files which we are we are
34:06 - getting here okay now let me show you
34:08 - here also so you will get idea about it
34:11 - how it's working you can go here
34:15 - and it should be somewhere like hidden
34:18 - files
34:20 - uh yeah here you can see the so hidden
34:22 - files is unchecked now we will check it
34:25 - and then yeah boom
34:27 - you can see the same result as we have
34:30 - by RC
34:32 - and here is also the without batch RC
34:34 - file and other some files which are
34:37 - present here also okay
34:39 - so for now I am again unchecking it
34:44 - so it should be simple
34:46 - okay
34:48 - so now uh we can combine The Hyphen L
34:50 - option with this also like air
34:53 - we are getting the same thing but what
34:56 - in the long format okay like this is the
34:59 - same permissions number some kind of and
35:02 - I use I use this is the username and
35:05 - group and root root is the root
35:08 - user who like we will get about this
35:11 - what is root and all these things when
35:13 - you when we will learn about the user
35:15 - creation things in Linux okay
35:18 - so uh I hope you got it the hyphen L
35:21 - option also okay
35:24 - uh let me tell you one more uh flag
35:28 - which are important here
35:30 - I like uh hyphen LD okay
35:34 - uh what we will do in this when we will
35:38 - uh combine the L with the directive
35:41 - distance for directory and one to get
35:43 - the details of the let's get documents
35:46 - directory
35:48 - yeah
35:50 - now here we can see you you are getting
35:52 - the details for a specific directory
35:55 - that is documents okay and here is the
35:58 - same thing that we were getting earlier
36:00 - like uh you can match it with it like
36:03 - documents and also you can see the
36:06 - permissions users group size and the
36:10 - last modification time okay
36:12 - this is the LD so these are the some
36:15 - basic uh Flags which you can use with
36:18 - the ls command
36:20 - okay and that's all for today and also
36:25 - if you want more like practice on it you
36:29 - can go here also on uh tryhackme.com
36:34 - like this is a platform on which there
36:37 - is a Linux
36:41 - tutorials or something you can say
36:46 - uh wait a minute
36:51 - oh yeah I think I got it here
36:56 - [Music]
36:56 - um
36:58 - in the long
37:01 - that should be in the learning path or
37:03 - somewhere else
37:08 - yeah Linux fundamentals
37:10 - okay if you want to uh more in-depth
37:14 - knowledge or you want to practice some
37:16 - your skills then you can go on this
37:18 - platform also okay
37:20 - so uh
37:24 - that's all for today and I hope you
37:26 - understood about the ls command if you
37:29 - they see it Linux just like about your
37:31 - practice if you do more practice you
37:32 - will get more family familiar with it
37:34 - like uh like when I had a starter it was
37:37 - like what is this thing and what is this
37:40 - terminal I was get scared of this domain
37:42 - but when you start practicing with it
37:44 - when you play with this then you will
37:47 - get a height about OS you can understand
37:49 - it okay
37:50 - so that's all for today and uh please
37:53 - like share and subscribe our Channel and
37:56 - hit the like button if you like this
37:58 - okay so thank you for watching and we
37:59 - will meet you in the next video thank
38:01 - you thank you so much
38:05 - so now today in this video what we are
38:07 - going to learn so basically we are going
38:09 - to learn about one of the more basic
38:11 - command that is CD command which means
38:13 - the change directory okay so if it
38:15 - stands for change directory command so
38:17 - what we will do today we will learn
38:20 - about how we can change our directory
38:21 - from one to another okay now what I have
38:24 - to do I have to just increase the font
38:26 - size for you guys it should be visible
38:29 - uh I think yeah it's okay it's visible
38:32 - it should be
38:34 - and in the next video in window what I
38:37 - will do I will just open this file
38:39 - manager for your reference to show you
38:42 - how the things are working okay
38:48 - now this is our home directory here you
38:51 - can see home
38:53 - okay and right now we are also in the
38:56 - terminal we are on the home table
38:57 - directory what we will do we will do
38:59 - this just LS okay
39:02 - so here you can see we are getting
39:03 - different files like different directory
39:06 - directories desktop
39:08 - downloads pictures snap videos documents
39:11 - and so on okay so now today in this
39:14 - video what we are going to learn about
39:15 - the CD command okay
39:17 - CD what it basically means series also
39:21 - stands for change directory what it will
39:23 - do it will just change your directory
39:25 - okay now our current direct is what it
39:28 - is our home okay we are at home we want
39:30 - to go on the desktop
39:32 - okay how we will do it so if there are
39:36 - the two ways in which we can perform
39:37 - this action like first one is that we
39:39 - that is basically a concept of Linux so
39:42 - that's why I'm telling you uh that is of
39:44 - I think one of these is absolute path
39:46 - name and the second is reality path
39:48 - names okay
39:50 - so first we will talk about the absolute
39:52 - path I mean absolute path names what we
39:54 - do we just provide the whole
39:56 - path okay
39:59 - uh wait a minute I will provide the
40:03 - desktop path okay I want to go move to
40:07 - into the desktop directly what I will do
40:09 - CD desktop this is basically what
40:11 - absolute path names okay
40:13 - so I will just hit enter and now you can
40:15 - see I am in the desktop now what I will
40:18 - do I will do LS
40:21 - okay so here you can see the file which
40:25 - uh this is also one directive in which
40:28 - we had created in the last video okay so
40:31 - this is the
40:33 - files of the
40:35 - desktop directory okay so this is the
40:39 - like one of the way in which we can do
40:42 - it like we call it as the absolute path
40:44 - names and now the next is reality path
40:47 - now what is this so basically relative
40:49 - patterns works for a particular notation
40:51 - that is thought then or you can say
40:53 - double dot okay
40:55 - so what I have to do now I have to go
40:58 - back now I am in the desktop I have to
41:01 - go back okay like from
41:05 - let me cancel it like from here you can
41:07 - see
41:08 - I'm in the tag uh right now we are here
41:11 - at the test okay in the desktop
41:13 - directory now what I have to go I have
41:15 - to go back in the where in the home
41:17 - directory
41:18 - so for this what I will do I will just
41:20 - do CD dot dot
41:23 - again back we are back okay we are in
41:26 - this particular
41:28 - window or get this in this particular
41:31 - window you can say like in the home
41:32 - directory now there is also one more
41:35 - command uh which you you've learned in
41:37 - this video like that is PWD
41:41 - what it does it just shows you the
41:43 - present working directly so our present
41:45 - working directory is home slash is
41:47 - because you I use is one of the user of
41:49 - this particular OS that's why it's
41:51 - showing I would like whenever you will
41:53 - create multiple users then you will get
41:55 - your own particular home directory in
41:57 - which you will create your separate
41:58 - files and folders or anything which you
41:59 - want to create okay that's why it's
42:01 - showing home I use now what I will do I
42:04 - will move into the documents directory
42:08 - okay
42:09 - documents okay now
42:12 - now I am here documents so now what I
42:15 - will do I will just do PWD
42:17 - so here you can see we are getting again
42:19 - the same present working at this CD like
42:22 - home I use documents okay I hope you got
42:24 - the idea about how PWD is working how
42:27 - documents is working now what I have to
42:29 - do I have to just go back one more
42:31 - directory back
42:34 - one activate dot dot okay we are back
42:37 - now I have a loop it WT again we are at
42:40 - the home and ayush
42:41 - we're at the home directory now we'll
42:44 - just hit uh clear button and here what
42:48 - we will do we will create our own
42:49 - structure here you can see LS command is
42:51 - one of the folder
42:53 - and uh
42:56 - I will open up this folder and I will
42:58 - try to create
43:00 - again new folder
43:02 - that is
43:03 - S2
43:06 - okay now what we will do we have to come
43:09 - directly in the LS command folder so how
43:12 - we can do it first we first of all we
43:14 - will do LS
43:15 - okay we got the list of the already
43:17 - active which are present in the home
43:19 - directory now where I have to go I have
43:21 - to go in the documents directory so I
43:23 - will do CD
43:26 - documents I am just entering uh like
43:29 - after typing the Duc and then you if you
43:32 - will hit tab then automatically it will
43:34 - like like this document okay then after
43:37 - documents where we have to go
43:39 - like now I am in documents now I will do
43:41 - LS we are on the this documents for
43:45 - directory and here is the directory that
43:46 - is LS command now what I have to do LS
43:49 - command okay
43:51 - now where we are we are in the document
43:53 - slash LS command now what I will do I
43:55 - will do LS
43:57 - this is
43:58 - we are in the S2
44:00 - not in the test two like this is the
44:02 - content of this particular directory
44:05 - like LS command now I I will do I will
44:08 - again go back and go into the test two
44:11 - okay
44:13 - well let me increase that width so it
44:15 - should be clear to you
44:16 - okay now what I will do I will just hit
44:19 - PWD
44:21 - with WD means present working right so
44:23 - my present working right is home I use
44:24 - documents LS command and the test two
44:27 - okay now what we will do we will go back
44:30 - one by one
44:31 - CD dot dot
44:34 - We Are One director pack CD dot dot
44:38 - again one direct back CD dot dot Again
44:41 - One Direction back now we are where we
44:43 - are
44:44 - we are in the home directory now what I
44:47 - will do I will just give the whole path
44:50 - okay
44:52 - documents
44:53 - slash
44:55 - LS command
44:56 - slash test
44:58 - in this way you can also go in the like
45:00 - your final destination act like
45:02 - providing the whole path in a single
45:04 - string
45:05 - okay now what I will do PWD
45:07 - so here you can see the whole path like
45:11 - this is same as this this one like when
45:14 - we move went to that directly like one
45:17 - by one okay when we were doing one by
45:19 - one then we were all getting these
45:21 - results and also when we are doing like
45:23 - in a single string then also we are
45:24 - getting a steam result I hope you got
45:26 - the idea about how the CD change direct
45:28 - working okay
45:32 - let me clear this now there is also one
45:35 - more shortcut to go directly in the home
45:36 - directory that is CD
45:39 - this tilt it will directly go into the
45:41 - home directory that is LS okay or we
45:45 - when we will do PWD you will get that
45:48 - particular window
45:50 - okay so I hope you got this uh how the
45:53 - things are working and this is all about
45:55 - the CD like change directory command
45:57 - Okay so it stands for change directory
46:01 - okay I hope it is clear now so we will
46:05 - meet in the next video with uh like we
46:07 - will create some folders and files and
46:09 - all these things we will talk about in
46:10 - the next video so that's all for today's
46:12 - video and thank you for watching so
46:14 - we'll meet the next one okay thank you
46:16 - thank you for watching
46:18 - so mkdr command is nothing but uh like
46:21 - it just stands for the make directory
46:23 - okay what by directory means like in
46:25 - Linux we basically uh call directly but
46:28 - in the other uh operating system like
46:31 - Windows what we call it as a folder so
46:33 - director is something basically like a
46:35 - folder you can uh like you can say like
46:38 - that okay direct is like a folder so now
46:40 - what I was talking about uh to create a
46:42 - directory so what we will do uh we'll uh
46:46 - take uh like uh
46:49 - ah structure to create a directory okay
46:51 - so let me draw a structure for you
46:59 - this is a website where you can easily
47:02 - like
47:03 - draw any kind of structure or whatever
47:05 - you want okay
47:08 - I want to create a blank diagram create
47:11 - okay save it anywhere I don't care
47:17 - save oh sorry
47:20 - test
47:24 - okay here it is now what we will do uh
47:30 - we will create first uh
47:33 - University
47:35 - okay
47:37 - then
47:40 - in that University we will create
47:46 - students
47:50 - okay
47:52 - and then we will
47:56 - create
47:59 - fatalities
48:02 - and then we will create
48:07 - uh you can call it as a workers okay
48:13 - and in the student section we will
48:15 - create a
48:18 - like we will name it one of the student
48:22 - like ayush okay are
48:25 - something like XYZ okay and similarly in
48:29 - the faculties
48:30 - uh you want to give it as some kind of
48:34 - instead of Faculty here I will try to
48:36 - give it a subject okay now here we will
48:40 - write Linux
48:42 - networking okay and we will leave the
48:45 - workers has a blank okay so we will
48:47 - follow this pattern to create a
48:48 - directive so this will be helpful too
48:50 - like when you play with it you will get
48:52 - a better idea like and also you will get
48:54 - a practice about the CD command that we
48:57 - have learned earlier in the last video
48:59 - okay
49:00 - so uh
49:02 - how will we proceed I will try to just
49:05 - uh
49:06 - off the screen
49:08 - I hope it should be visible to you
49:12 - okay yeah now it is visible
49:16 - and now what we will do I will clear the
49:19 - screen and we will do just LS okay so
49:22 - here what we have we have just desktop
49:24 - downloads pictures snap and these things
49:26 - okay and I will try to hit just PW to
49:29 - PWD we are in where we are in the home
49:32 - directory now what I will do I will
49:34 - create a first University directory okay
49:37 - so I'll get m k d i r and then I will
49:41 - write University
49:44 - okay
49:46 - I have created University let's say tell
49:48 - us okay so here you can see uh we have
49:51 - got the university directory now what I
49:54 - have to do in the University I have to
49:56 - create this student's directory subject
49:58 - and workers okay first what we will do
50:01 - we will create these directors one by
50:03 - one then after the after the whole this
50:07 - completion of the whole diagram
50:09 - sorry what we will do
50:12 - we will create these three directory
50:14 - like in a row okay in a single command
50:16 - we will do it okay so let's do it first
50:18 - single single okay so I will first go
50:22 - into the university directory
50:24 - CD
50:26 - and then we will do LS that is nothing
50:28 - what I will do I will create a student
50:30 - directory students
50:33 - okay
50:34 - then I will create when you kill upper
50:37 - key then you will get the previous
50:38 - command okay then I will create subject
50:43 - then I will create workers okay so now I
50:48 - will do LS so here you can see we have
50:50 - got the three directories now what I
50:52 - have to do I have to create a more
50:54 - director then
50:56 - uh students so here is one thing also I
50:59 - want to tell you about like here
51:00 - students in this students uh you will
51:03 - see the SS Capital but when I will try
51:06 - to hit s with the small
51:09 - then what happens no such value why
51:11 - because this is a case sensitive in
51:12 - Linux it follows questions activity okay
51:14 - that's why it happens now what I will do
51:17 - c capital is then tab
51:19 - now tab okay restaurants now where we
51:23 - are we are in the student directory when
51:25 - I will do PWD what we will get
51:28 - will get the exact location where we are
51:31 - okay so now what we have to do first of
51:34 - all I want to clear this whole thing
51:35 - okay now what I will do I will create
51:37 - two directors with name
51:42 - ayush and with name
51:45 - uh
51:49 - Ankit okay
51:51 - LS are you think it has been created
51:53 - okay now what I will do I have to go
51:57 - back in the subject directory so how we
52:00 - can do it we will do just CD dot dot
52:03 - remember in the last video we talked
52:05 - about this CD dot dot and here now where
52:09 - I am I am in the University when I will
52:11 - do LS I will have the access of subject
52:13 - and workers also what I will do now I
52:16 - will just do CD
52:18 - subject
52:19 - okay and then again we are in the
52:22 - subject directory now what I have to do
52:24 - I have to create
52:26 - two directors
52:27 - Linux
52:29 - and then
52:32 - networking okay now I'll do LS here you
52:35 - can see Linux and networking has been
52:37 - created and in the workers directory we
52:40 - don't have to write anything or we don't
52:41 - have to create any kind of folder in it
52:43 - okay so this is the basically like
52:45 - simple process of creating files and
52:47 - directors in the Linux and now I will
52:50 - tell you some like
52:52 - ah means I will do like creating these
52:56 - whole things in a single command okay
52:58 - not whole things but yeah this one and
53:00 - this one I will try to create okay
53:03 - so what I will do
53:04 - uh I will go in the home directory again
53:09 - clear now
53:10 - and I will show you here also like how
53:14 - in the file system it will look like
53:16 - whether it is there or not okay
53:19 - uh yeah
53:20 - here you can see University directors
53:23 - here in the University we have student
53:24 - subject workers and in the students we
53:26 - have ayushananket and back and in the
53:30 - subject we have Linux and networking and
53:32 - now what I will do I will just delete
53:34 - this directory okay
53:36 - uh
53:38 - from here I can delete okay to delete
53:41 - the directories and all I will tell you
53:43 - this in the next video okay
53:45 - otherwise everything will get mixed up
53:48 - okay
53:49 - so now if I will do LS here so there is
53:51 - no University folder is there now what I
53:54 - will do I will just create a university
53:55 - folder
53:57 - uh sorry University
53:59 - okay now university has been created I
54:02 - will move into this directory and now I
54:05 - have to do you know I have to create a
54:06 - student subject workers so what I can do
54:08 - mkdir
54:11 - students okay
54:14 - space
54:16 - subject
54:17 - I think spelling mistake is there
54:19 - something okay yeah subject and then
54:22 - I'll get Workers
54:24 - boom now let's hit LS then you will get
54:28 - something yeah so here what we are doing
54:30 - in the same in the single command we are
54:33 - creating three directories or you can
54:35 - create multiple Direction uh it all
54:37 - depends on you how much you want to
54:39 - create okay
54:40 - and now what I have to do in the
54:41 - students we have to create ayush and x y
54:44 - z so how I will do mkdir
54:49 - and
54:51 - students
54:53 - sorry sorry uh
54:55 - okay sorry for it uh I I'm strict
54:59 - entered
55:02 - enter okay
55:05 - this is LS okay now what I have to do I
55:07 - will go in the students directory
55:09 - students
55:12 - okay now what I will do I will create
55:15 - again the both
55:17 - iusion and get like before I send again
55:21 - okay unless
55:23 - same okay so this is the like one way to
55:26 - create multiple directories at in a
55:28 - single command okay so I hope you got it
55:30 - how you can create multiple directories
55:32 - okay I'm not going to show you for the
55:34 - subject like it will be then you will
55:36 - get bored like I am like displaying you
55:38 - same things again and again okay so now
55:40 - let me tell you something more
55:42 - interesting things okay I will clear
55:44 - and then go back into the home directory
55:47 - clear everything LS and now what I will
55:50 - do now
55:52 - I want to tell you some more Concepts
55:54 - like uh the options which we can use
55:57 - with the hyphen P command Okay so the
56:00 - first option which I want to show you
56:02 - like hyphen V that stands for verbose
56:05 - so when we will do this mkdir hyphen V
56:08 - it will tell you the like whether
56:11 - directory has been created or not okay
56:13 - so let me let me create uh like
56:17 - um
56:18 - uh what anything Linux okay
56:23 - here you can see create a directory
56:26 - Linux again uh let me tell you again I
56:28 - want to create same directive let's see
56:30 - what happens
56:31 - here you can see cannot create a Linux
56:34 - file exist what if I remove iPhone B
56:37 - whether it stays displaying or not the
56:40 - same error
56:41 - okay it displays the same here okay so
56:44 - but when we use hyphen way it will tell
56:46 - you the status like whether direct is
56:47 - created or not okay
56:50 - I hope it's clear hyphen B and in the
56:52 - next uh we will talk about hyphen P also
56:55 - what it does hyphen p uh like when we
56:58 - suppose we want to create a directory in
57:01 - which like University in the University
57:03 - students and then in the student we want
57:06 - ayush okay I usually want only okay so
57:10 - how we can do it uh but before uh that I
57:14 - will need to sorry I will not delete
57:16 - that okay I'll let it be I will get some
57:19 - more uh extra scenario like
57:22 - uh
57:26 - let's create some kind of
57:29 - like uh
57:33 - um
57:34 - Sun
57:36 - and with sun let's create a
57:41 - hair father
57:48 - and then we will create obviously
57:51 - grandfather
57:53 - okay or we can go reverse also because I
57:56 - I think I have created in the reverse
58:00 - motion should be in the last okay
58:03 - grandfather okay now what I will do
58:06 - mkdir hyphen P option and Sun slash
58:11 - father
58:14 - smash grandfather
58:17 - okay so basically this command what it
58:20 - will it will create the like in the sun
58:22 - directory you will get further in the
58:23 - further directory you will get the
58:25 - grandfather but if you will not use
58:29 - hyphen P option then what will happen
58:31 - like we will not be able to create a
58:33 - directory like if one father does not
58:35 - exist then it will not create
58:38 - grandfather okay but if like if it
58:41 - exists and father exist okay
58:45 - sorry I
58:47 - got a little bit confused here let me
58:50 - first of all create this one okay LS
58:54 - should be sun directory Sun
58:57 - LS
58:59 - father
59:01 - LS okay so what I was trying to say like
59:04 - when we will use hyphen P option if Sun
59:06 - father is not created then it will be
59:10 - get created automatically but when we
59:12 - will not use hyphen P then it will not
59:14 - get created like uh let me go back and
59:18 - now what I will do I will try to create
59:20 - mkdr test one slash Test 2 slash test
59:26 - three it should be like in test one
59:28 - there should be test one test two there
59:30 - should be test three
59:31 - here you can see cannot create directory
59:33 - okay no such file your directors there
59:35 - okay so I hope you got the like actual
59:37 - role of the hyphen P option okay
59:41 - now this is not a more uh big deal if
59:44 - you want to if you play more and more
59:46 - with this command you will get familiar
59:48 - with this whole Linux environment okay
59:50 - that's not a big deal now the next thing
59:52 - is hyphen M option okay what it does
59:55 - this is nothing but mode okay mode or we
59:58 - can say permissions like uh uh till now
60:02 - we have not covered the permission
60:03 - section in Linux like it is another
60:05 - concept when the another another video
60:07 - will come up on this concept like read
60:10 - write execute all these things but still
60:12 - I tell you like if the if the person
60:15 - will have the read read permission then
60:17 - that user can read the file if he has
60:20 - right then he can write the file or
60:22 - execute then he can execute that file
60:24 - but if he has all the threatened he can
60:27 - do anything rewrite execute all okay so
60:29 - how we can do this mkdr hyphen M and we
60:33 - provide a equal to suppose we want to
60:35 - provide r w x all to the one directory
60:39 - that is test
60:41 - IOP test is not there yes
60:44 - distributed now what I have to do LSI
60:47 - funnel you can see here the permission
60:49 - of all these things
60:52 - and here you can see where it is test so
60:55 - r w x r w x r w three dot execute
60:59 - there is something like rwx for users
61:01 - and another this RW is for group and
61:05 - another this rwx is for other portions
61:07 - okay so when we will do test in this
61:11 - when we will go in this directory we can
61:13 - do any kind of operation MKT sorry mkdir
61:16 - test blah blah blah okay we can do
61:18 - anything but now what I will do I will
61:21 - try to create a uh One Directory with
61:23 - only read operations okay so let's see
61:27 - what happens whether we are able to
61:29 - create or not anything in that
61:31 - particular direct whether we have a
61:33 - permission or not
61:34 - so what I will do mkdir hyphen m a equal
61:38 - to I want to just read operation we can
61:41 - only read read and I will create test
61:46 - three
61:49 - let's do unless iPhone L and now you can
61:52 - see in test 3 we have only read
61:55 - permission to everyone
61:56 - users also groups also
62:00 - and others I think others have not any
62:03 - permission okay here okay
62:06 - now I will go in the test three
62:09 - test three so as you can see permission
62:14 - denied we don't have X access to that
62:16 - folder so now who can access this folder
62:19 - there is also one user in the Linux
62:21 - buddy root only root can access okay
62:27 - uh so that's all about this in this
62:30 - video like mkdr command so I hope you
62:33 - liked it and please like share subscribe
62:36 - our YouTube channel and now we will meet
62:38 - in the next video with another basic
62:40 - command like in the next video we'll
62:42 - basically talk about the whole deck
62:44 - which we have created we will then again
62:46 - we will create some directory then we
62:47 - will delete it with the director is
62:49 - empty then what what we can do if it is
62:51 - not empty then how we can delete it so
62:53 - these are all the things which we'll
62:54 - cover in the next video so that's all
62:56 - for today and we will meet in the next
62:57 - one thank you thank you so much for
62:58 - watching
63:01 - foreign
63:03 - so now what I will do I will create a
63:06 - one more directory I will start by
63:09 - creating a directory mkdir
63:13 - ayush
63:14 - okay
63:16 - I have created ayush and now what I have
63:19 - to do
63:21 - uh I have to again create a more
63:24 - directory in ayush CD ayush okay mkdir I
63:29 - used to
63:30 - okay I used to
63:32 - now we are done again I will go on the
63:35 - home directory
63:37 - and what I will do I will create one
63:39 - more directory mkdir
63:42 - um
63:44 - test 67
63:46 - okay so here you can see I wish I've
63:49 - been created already and they are used
63:50 - so directly we have another I used to
63:53 - and text 67 where it is oh yeah here
63:56 - this is one okay so I will perform here
63:59 - LS and now you can see all the direct
64:01 - which we have created now what I have to
64:03 - tell you like to remove this directory
64:06 - uh the command is rmdir Okay remove
64:10 - directory so there is a one thing in
64:14 - this
64:15 - like uh let me clear this all
64:18 - uh if directory is empty okay if like uh
64:25 - suppose this direct test 67 there is
64:28 - nothing this is empty directory so in
64:31 - this case we can easily use rmdir okay
64:34 - we can easily use it but if directory is
64:37 - not empty suppose in this case I used to
64:41 - so in this case when we will do rmdir so
64:45 - what will happen like it will uh like it
64:47 - will not delete that particular
64:48 - directory it will show you the error
64:50 - like uh directory is not empty okay but
64:54 - when you go in the iOS direct and when
64:57 - you will try to delete I used to then it
64:59 - can be easily deleted why the reason
65:01 - behind is this like I used 2 is
65:04 - empty
65:05 - okay I hope you got this point like how
65:08 - rmdr command works
65:10 - so uh now our job is to just delete the
65:14 - directory and learn the things okay so
65:16 - let's start
65:18 - so what we will do
65:20 - uh LS
65:21 - now I will first try to delete the test
65:24 - 67.
65:26 - test
65:27 - six seven okay so now what will happen I
65:31 - will hit just enter and now boom so you
65:34 - test this t7 has been deleted okay now
65:37 - again we will try to do LS here and so
65:39 - you will not see anywhere like test67 is
65:41 - there now now what we will do and yeah
65:44 - one more software I want to tell you
65:45 - that for clearing the terminal if you do
65:49 - clear then it will clear obviously but
65:51 - there is also one more shortcut like
65:52 - Control Plus l automatic it will get
65:56 - clear
65:57 - okay so now what we have to do we have
66:00 - to remove the directory ayush
66:02 - okay now let's see what happens
66:06 - fail to remove ayush directory not empty
66:09 - okay obviously direct is not empty we
66:11 - know like there is another folder in
66:14 - ayush so what we will do now we will go
66:16 - in if directory and then I will try to
66:19 - first delete I used to
66:22 - okay we have deleted and there is no any
66:25 - directory now what I will do I will go
66:28 - back in the home directory and I will
66:30 - delete ayush
66:32 - okay so I use has been deleted okay so
66:36 - suppose if there is many folders and
66:38 - directories like Suppose there in ayush
66:40 - there is I use two twice hundred okay or
66:43 - in that particular director there are
66:45 - other more directors okay so you have to
66:47 - delete this so this is very tedious work
66:50 - like uh like it's not easy to do one by
66:53 - one okay so like the solution for that
66:57 - is that like if we will use some flags
66:59 - with it okay so now again let me create
67:02 - a directory I will use hyphen P option
67:04 - if you watch previous video then you
67:05 - will get it what is hyphen p and all
67:07 - these things so I'm going to create uh
67:09 - not test let's create with iPhone
67:13 - I used to
67:15 - if3 so what what will happen here like
67:19 - in are you shown there will be I used to
67:21 - in ih2 they will rise three so you can
67:23 - check here uh
67:27 - 2 and I stand in ISO there will be
67:29 - nothing that will be empty directory
67:31 - so now what I have to do I have to
67:34 - delete this
67:35 - whole directory in single command so
67:38 - what I will do there are multiple ways I
67:40 - will tell you everything issue one by
67:42 - one the more different ways okay so we
67:45 - will use rmdir
67:48 - slash S okay and then we will just
67:53 - provide the directory name I use one
67:55 - okay so uh what this command will do
67:58 - basically it will delete the whole
68:00 - directory from the root to the in like
68:03 - child like it will start from ayush and
68:06 - it will end to the is3 and it will
68:09 - delete the whole file structure and with
68:11 - this command it will ask you for the
68:13 - permission like you have you will need
68:16 - to enter yes or no whether you want to
68:17 - delete or not like just like
68:19 - confirmation message it will ask for you
68:21 - let's check what happens
68:24 - okay uh it's showing
68:27 - no such file or directory
68:29 - why
68:31 - uh one minute let me check with this
68:35 - iPhone help whether it works in Ubuntu
68:38 - or not okay sorry we can use hyphen P
68:41 - option for that okay sorry
68:44 - what we will do rmdir hyphen t
68:48 - are you sure
68:50 - I think we will need to provide whole
68:52 - path okay I use three so we can easily
68:55 - have we have deleted easily in this way
68:57 - also we can use rmdr in this way okay
69:01 - but there is also one way uh that slash
69:04 - is I will need to just check with the
69:06 - Google uh
69:07 - why this command didn't work
69:11 - uh
69:16 - not working with Ubuntu
69:19 - make I have used this command earlier it
69:21 - was working in my Linux machine
69:24 - uh let me check with it
69:32 - um
69:34 - and also let's go with the rmdr slash
69:37 - okay Google is your friend buddy like if
69:40 - you will stuck somewhere then this is
69:43 - your only friend where you will get the
69:44 - help okay
69:46 - okay so here is the like documentation
69:48 - of Microsoft then if it is Microsoft
69:51 - then like it should be correct here
69:54 - slices what it's saying deletes a
69:56 - directory
69:57 - this is why I can also up directly
69:59 - including all files okay we were
70:02 - corrected
70:03 - and this rmdir slash S test to remove a
70:07 - direct name test and always
70:09 - okay
70:11 - we were doing the same thing I didn't
70:13 - get to why it's not working in Ubuntu uh
70:16 - like there may be some reason
70:20 - uh
70:22 - here you can see uh like there is uh
70:25 - then maybe okay I'll leave it uh I will
70:29 - try one once more let's check it happens
70:32 - or not I'll try to create again the same
70:34 - directory
70:35 - I will just hit the
70:40 - what was the command rmdir slashes and
70:44 - uh are you sure it's there
70:48 - okay okay okay okay okay
70:52 - fail to remove okay
70:56 - if I do Force fully then what happens
71:00 - okay it's not working even
71:05 - so now
71:06 - what are the options to delete the whole
71:08 - directory in a single command like slash
71:12 - has failed in Ubuntu I don't know why
71:15 - we'll figure it out later uh but now
71:17 - what is the other way so there is a way
71:20 - so what we will do we can we use the RM
71:23 - command okay with the help of this
71:25 - command we can easily delete all the
71:28 - files like in a single command what we
71:31 - will use the flag with it RM hyphen RF
71:33 - okay and then are you sure
71:36 - done we are done buddy like RF stands
71:41 - for recursively and Fs terms of
71:42 - forcefully we can easily use this RM
71:45 - command to remove these directories in a
71:47 - one single command okay
71:50 - so uh that's all for um today I hope you
71:54 - got it like how we can delete the
71:57 - directories you know in this uh by using
71:59 - a particular single command or by one by
72:01 - one command like basically uh in the
72:04 - like uh real world we basically use this
72:07 - RMI from RF okay we use it uh because uh
72:11 - like uh whenever we create a direct rate
72:15 - will not be empty like you can get it
72:18 - you can relate it with it like whenever
72:20 - you create then you create it for some
72:21 - kind of purpose that's why so we can
72:24 - easily use this RM iPhone RF command for
72:26 - this uh removing directory okay so
72:29 - that's all for today uh I hope you liked
72:32 - it I hope and
72:35 - if you have any query then please you
72:37 - can ask us in comment section and yeah
72:38 - please do like share and subscribe our
72:40 - Channel and yeah thank you thank you for
72:42 - watching this video
72:44 - how we can create files in Linux using
72:47 - touch command okay so here and here in
72:49 - both side there is files there is files
72:51 - okay and I will move into that
72:53 - particular directory
72:56 - files okay and now what I will do I will
72:59 - create some files using touch command
73:02 - okay
73:03 - so I will do
73:04 - touch
73:06 - file one dot txt
73:09 - okay so basically what this command will
73:11 - do it will just like delete the uh sorry
73:14 - I'm saying delete it will just create
73:16 - file one dot txt okay but that file will
73:20 - be empty for you like there will you
73:23 - cannot write anything like that and you
73:25 - will need to first open that file then
73:26 - you will need to write in that date okay
73:28 - but there are also some ways where we
73:30 - can perform both things like
73:33 - simultaneously we can like create files
73:36 - and we can write something in that also
73:38 - but this we will see in the next video
73:40 - okay so first we will uh talk about this
73:44 - touch command so whenever I will hit
73:47 - enter
73:48 - and I will do LS and here you will see
73:51 - like file1.txt
73:53 - will be created okay
73:56 - so I hope it is clear to you and now
73:59 - what if I want to create multiple files
74:01 - okay then I can easily do with file2.txt
74:07 - file 3.txt
74:10 - file 4 Dot txt
74:14 - and I will just hit enter uh sorry LS
74:18 - and here you can see all these and four
74:20 - files have been created okay so this is
74:23 - the one way to create files okay
74:26 - and now with the touch command like we
74:29 - can use various options with it like
74:31 - hyphen a hyphen m
74:34 - hyphen R also we can use it so I will
74:38 - start with the first one that is hyphen
74:40 - a option basically what this option does
74:43 - like it will change the access time of
74:47 - your file suppose now we have created
74:50 - this file let me do LS iPhone l
74:53 - okay so file one has been created at
74:56 - this one
74:58 - 12 42 am okay
75:00 - and this is 43 and all these things so
75:03 - basically this is the modification time
75:05 - okay if you want to look at the access
75:08 - time you will need to hit LS iPhone Lu
75:12 - okay uh access time 42 okay
75:16 - The Hyphen L option will show you the
75:19 - modification time hyphen Lu option will
75:22 - show you the access time when the file
75:24 - is accessed okay so what I'm going to do
75:28 - I will try to access this file and now
75:31 - 1244 it is okay
75:34 - so I have accessed this file okay I will
75:37 - write something
75:38 - hi
75:40 - okay and I will just close it
75:43 - and again I will do this I will need to
75:46 - find the access time
75:48 - so here you can see the
75:50 - 1244 is now the access time of file one
75:54 - dot txt okay and I have not visited
75:57 - file.txt yet okay so it's access time
75:59 - and it is still showing 1243 so now what
76:03 - I have to do
76:05 - I will change the access time using the
76:08 - hyphen a option
76:10 - so how we can do it touch
76:12 - hyphen a
76:14 - and then file name so I want to change
76:17 - the access time for
76:19 - file name uh which one uh let's do for
76:22 - file1.txt okay so it will change my
76:26 - access time from 1244 to the my current
76:28 - time so my current time is what
76:31 - 12 45 okay
76:35 - and now I will do LS iPhone Lu and here
76:38 - you can see file1.txt okay
76:41 - now what I will do
76:44 - like here we have not uh like uh visited
76:49 - this file 2.txt okay even when you don't
76:52 - open that file we don't write anything
76:55 - in that word Define still you can change
76:57 - the access time for it okay
76:59 - suppose or there is someone in your like
77:02 - working environment like you want to
77:04 - change the access time or just for your
77:06 - any kind of purpose okay
77:09 - so what I am going to do uh
77:13 - touch hyphen a I will just
77:16 - change the file name from file 1 to 2.
77:20 - okay and now I will do LS hyphen
77:25 - Lu
77:26 - and here you can see the access time for
77:28 - File 2 has been
77:30 - like change now okay it's 1240
77:34 - 6 okay and now uh I will just clear it
77:38 - all now again I will check the access
77:41 - time so access time is for first one 12
77:44 - 45 12 46. and for let's check for
77:47 - modification time that is at the
77:50 - modification of this is showing 1244
77:53 - okay and 12 43 1243 all the Y 12 44
77:57 - because uh we you know we have right
78:00 - high in this file one dot taxi that's
78:02 - why it's showing 1244 okay
78:05 - now what if you want to change the
78:07 - modification time instead of this access
78:10 - time so what way I will do now I will
78:13 - just hit uh
78:15 - like work with the hyphen M option okay
78:18 - hyphen m
78:21 - and I will change for
78:23 - file 3.txt
78:27 - and now let's do just LS hyphen L file 3
78:30 - you can do like this also
78:33 - and now it's swing 12 47 as here it was
78:37 - 12 43 now the it is modified to the 1247
78:41 - and here you can see the access time is
78:44 - 1243 so now let's check also the access
78:47 - time for file 3.txt whether it is change
78:50 - or not it will not change because we
78:51 - have not done anything with it so it
78:53 - will be as it is like it is 1243 okay
78:57 - so I hope you got it how it is working
79:00 - the how we can basically change the
79:01 - access time modification time with the
79:03 - touch command okay we are creating files
79:06 - also and we can also manipulate the
79:08 - access time and the modification I'm
79:09 - using this command
79:11 - okay so now uh moving uh forward uh the
79:15 - there is also one option hyphen R okay
79:18 - so basically this option what it will do
79:20 - it will just uh like uh
79:24 - what we can say like copy the access
79:26 - time of first file to the second file
79:29 - okay so now what I will need to do
79:33 - I will show you both the uh
79:38 - access time I will show you for file
79:40 - 1.xt and what I will do
79:42 - touch hyphen r
79:46 - file one
79:47 - and five
79:50 - two dot txt okay and again I will do the
79:53 - ls hyphen Lu
79:56 - so here you can see the access time for
79:59 - file 2.txt has been changed from 12 46
80:02 - to 12 45
80:04 - and now let's check for the modification
80:07 - time for file 1 and file two so
80:09 - modification time for file 1 and file 2
80:11 - is same okay I hope you got it how it is
80:16 - working in the access time and
80:17 - modification now I hope you got another
80:19 - like how hyphen a hyphen M and iPhone R
80:23 - option works together okay so that's all
80:26 - for this video and in the next video we
80:28 - will basically talk about how we can
80:31 - write some kind of like whatever you
80:33 - have to write in the file while creating
80:36 - a file okay so that's it for today and
80:39 - we will meet in the next one so thank
80:41 - you thank you for watching and please do
80:43 - like share and subscribe our Channel and
80:45 - if you have any queries then you can ask
80:47 - us in the comment section okay
80:49 - thank you thank you for watching
80:50 - and now in this video we will talk about
80:53 - uh how we can create files using cat
80:55 - command and also we will see some other
80:57 - operations using add command okay
81:00 - so uh let me increase the size of the
81:02 - terminal I think now it's fine and I
81:05 - will just open up my
81:07 - file system in my left hand side to
81:10 - be more clear with the you guys okay
81:13 - so now what we will need to do uh we
81:15 - will we will have to learn about uh cat
81:17 - command okay so basically cat command uh
81:20 - we can use to create files and also we
81:22 - can use this cat command tool like
81:24 - concatenate some more files together or
81:27 - you can say like merging more than one
81:29 - file in a one single file okay you can
81:31 - also do it in this and also uh we can
81:34 - use it like uh
81:36 - like to get the how many numbers like to
81:39 - show the lines and all those things in
81:41 - this in the particular files okay so now
81:44 - we will start with the creating file
81:45 - okay
81:47 - so let me do first LS so I think I have
81:50 - some files directory
81:52 - let me check what is there okay file on
81:55 - file 4 okay
81:56 - now what is uh
81:59 - let's create some files with cat command
82:02 - Okay so cat I will go with the test1.txt
82:09 - and what here the main benefit is that
82:11 - we can simultaneously write whatever we
82:13 - want to write in that particular test
82:14 - file
82:15 - so here I am just writing this is
82:19 - test one file
82:22 - okay in txt format
82:26 - and what you have to do you have to just
82:28 - hit enter and then Ctrl T okay so in
82:31 - this way we can create files okay
82:33 - and now what we have to do
82:36 - we have to do LS and here you will see
82:38 - test1.txt has been created for you and
82:41 - here also you can see it okay now now
82:43 - the other feature of cat command is that
82:45 - like you can also read the contents of
82:49 - that text file so how you can do it you
82:51 - can just get and then the whatever the
82:54 - file name is there you can provide it
82:56 - okay at test1.xt
82:59 - I will hit enter and here you will see
83:01 - the whatever is the content of the file
83:05 - um like it is being printed here okay
83:09 - so uh this is the like two operations we
83:11 - covered and now what we will need to do
83:13 - uh I'll create one more file okay
83:18 - uh cat uh
83:20 - test two Dot txt
83:23 - okay and here I will write this is
83:27 - test to file in
83:31 - txt format okay and just hit enter and
83:35 - then Ctrl D and now what we will do we
83:37 - will see the content of test2.txt and
83:40 - here you can see this is test 2 file in
83:43 - txt
83:44 - format okay now what we will need to do
83:47 - what I will do I will try to like
83:50 - concatenate
83:51 - like uh what you can say
83:54 - test test two content in test one okay
83:57 - so how I can do it get
84:00 - test1 dot txt then again this
84:05 - redirection operator this is called
84:06 - redirection operator
84:08 - and test2.txt hit enter I will try to
84:12 - see the content of first
84:14 - test one let's see what is there okay so
84:18 - basically this command like will append
84:20 - in test2.txt not in text one sorry for
84:23 - that
84:24 - okay test two and here you can see like
84:28 - the whatever the content of text one
84:31 - file has been included in this
84:33 - particular Test 2 file okay from here
84:36 - you can see also like when I will just
84:38 - hit
84:39 - double click on it and here you can see
84:41 - the same thing here also okay
84:44 - so this is the one way of like appending
84:47 - uh two files together okay
84:50 - and what we can do uh if you want to
84:54 - like append content of those file in
84:57 - another some file likes suppose like
85:00 - test three file so what we will do we
85:03 - will there is just simple a cat
85:07 - uh test1.txt
85:11 - test2.txt
85:12 - and then nothing just a redirection
85:15 - operator and here we will write test3
85:17 - Dot txt and now what we will do we will
85:21 - see here like test 3 has been created
85:23 - also when we will do LS here you can see
85:25 - test 3 has been created now what we will
85:28 - do I will try to read the content of
85:31 - test 3.
85:34 - 3 Dot txt
85:38 - okay oh so here you can see the content
85:42 - of both the files like this is showing
85:44 - test on two terms because in test two uh
85:46 - it was there like this was the content
85:48 - of Testo file okay
85:50 - so in this way we can like merge
85:52 - multiple files as many you want okay and
85:56 - now I'm moving forward like now we will
86:00 - learn about some like uh what we can say
86:03 - little bit options which we can use with
86:05 - this card command
86:07 - so first option I will uh I want to show
86:10 - you is cat hyphen n
86:14 - test3.txt
86:17 - so this command basically what it does
86:19 - it uh basically like show you the lines
86:22 - with number wise okay here you can see
86:24 - this first line This is third line now
86:27 - similarly here also you can see the uh
86:30 - like all those things like one two three
86:32 - okay
86:34 - so
86:35 - this is the one way uh to like get the
86:39 - files by number wise and if you want to
86:42 - uh check the like end where is the
86:46 - ending of that all the line then at that
86:49 - time it will show you the dollar
86:50 - character at the end of the line okay
86:57 - here you can see like here the line is
86:59 - ending that's why it is showing dollar
87:01 - here what if we will do uh here I will
87:06 - change little bit uh like here I will
87:09 - change like uh this is
87:12 - another file and I will just hit Ctrl s
87:16 - and full stop also
87:20 - and let me cut this
87:24 - and here you can see the line is ending
87:26 - here okay
87:28 - so I hope you got it why it's showing
87:30 - dollar dollars because like here at this
87:32 - point of line uh
87:36 - sentence or at this point of word thus
87:39 - the line has been ended so here that's
87:41 - why here it is Swing dollar okay so this
87:44 - is the basic use of hyphen e command
87:48 - okay and now uh what if you want to add
87:52 - like
87:54 - some more content in uh like previous
87:57 - file previous file it means like it is
88:00 - already created you don't have to create
88:01 - anything for it so for that you don't
88:04 - have to do anything uh you have to just
88:09 - apply double the direction of it that is
88:11 - this one okay and suppose I want to
88:13 - write in test1.txt
88:17 - okay and here first we will see the
88:19 - content of this so here you can see this
88:21 - is test on file index free format and I
88:24 - have to write
88:26 - something like this is a tutorial
88:31 - based on
88:33 - Linux
88:35 - cities or something like that okay and
88:38 - just hit Ctrl D okay and I will just
88:41 - like uh re-open this
88:45 - particular
88:47 - file
88:50 - um
88:51 - okay so here you can see like uh this is
88:55 - tutorial based online site has been I
88:57 - like added in this particular
88:59 - test1.txt file okay
89:03 - and uh there is also one like option
89:06 - which we can see like uh hyphen T option
89:10 - okay so basically what it does uh it
89:14 - will show you the tab like where where
89:17 - is the tab in the particular line okay
89:22 - so what I will do now I will just
89:26 - like uh give a tab here okay one time
89:31 - two tab three time I'm giving here okay
89:35 - and just Ctrl s and the tab will be
89:39 - represented by this this symbol I think
89:42 - let's see what it shows
89:45 - cat file one dot
89:49 - uh sorry what is the file name okay
89:51 - test1.txt
89:53 - test one dot txt
89:56 - okay so this is the content which we saw
90:00 - and now what I will do I will just have
90:02 - to use the
90:04 - High 20 option and here you can see and
90:08 - this is uh the particular symbol and I
90:11 - III it's showing like three tabs is
90:14 - there it is showing that's it okay so uh
90:18 - uh that's all about uh like this cat
90:22 - command okay I hope you liked it and if
90:24 - you have any issue or if you are facing
90:26 - any problem any kind of confusion then
90:28 - you can ask us in comment section and
90:30 - yeah please do like share and subscribe
90:32 - our Channel okay thank you thank you for
90:34 - watching we'll meet in the next video
90:38 - and now in this video we will talk about
90:42 - RM command Okay so RM basically stands
90:45 - for remove okay so in this basically
90:47 - like video we will uh we're gonna talk
90:50 - about how we can remove files okay
90:53 - and also like basically this uh the RM
90:57 - command basically we use it for removing
90:59 - files but also we can use it for
91:01 - removing directories also okay
91:03 - so today we will see and learn all about
91:06 - this so now what we have to do I will
91:09 - just create some files
91:11 - okay
91:13 - let me do a list okay so there is no any
91:16 - files I have deleted all
91:19 - okay start with touch
91:22 - one dot txt two Dot txt
91:27 - 3 Dot txt and four dot txt okay I hope
91:32 - you you are aware of this touch command
91:34 - as we have already covered
91:36 - okay now unless so here you will you can
91:39 - see like all the four files have been
91:42 - created okay now what I have to do uh I
91:45 - will tell you about the RM command okay
91:49 - so basically
91:50 - uh Rim command is used to remove the
91:53 - directory how we can uh sorry denote
91:55 - directors files also okay not only
91:58 - directory okay
92:00 - so what we will do uh we will try to
92:03 - remove the one dot txt okay so how I can
92:05 - do it RM and then the file name one dot
92:09 - txt
92:11 - and now what I will do I will just hit
92:13 - LS
92:15 - and here you can see 1.xt is not here
92:18 - okay it is deleted now
92:20 - again let's start with 2 Dot txt
92:27 - it is also related
92:29 - now let's uh Delete three Dot txt
92:33 - and again 4.txt
92:37 - okay now let's hit it enter NLS
92:42 - and here you will see uh all the files
92:44 - which we have created has been deleted
92:47 - okay
92:48 - so uh like this is how tedious work like
92:51 - when you will remove one by one one by
92:53 - one so if you want to remove many files
92:56 - like at one time okay so how you can do
93:00 - it
93:01 - so again I will need to just create all
93:04 - those texts so I created a photo of four
93:08 - txt files now what I have to do I will
93:10 - just rm1
93:13 - then 2 then 3 then 4.
93:18 - I will just hit enter
93:21 - and LS all file that's gone okay nothing
93:25 - is there so all file has been deleted
93:27 - now so now let me tell you about the sum
93:30 - of the options which you can use with
93:33 - this RM command like hyphen f
93:35 - hyphen I also Capital IV all these
93:39 - things I will tell you okay so again let
93:42 - me get those files okay now files has
93:44 - been created here
93:46 - now I will show you
93:48 - RM hyphen I option small I
93:53 - uh what it will like do what so
93:56 - basically it just prompts you for the
93:59 - like confirmation like whether you want
94:02 - to delete this file or Not by sometime
94:04 - what happens you by mistake like delete
94:08 - some of the files you don't get any
94:10 - prompt and all so with this option you
94:13 - will get prompt okay so I will just hit
94:15 - enter and here you will see removed
94:17 - regular empty file you have to do yes or
94:19 - no if I will do yes
94:22 - it will get
94:24 - deleted I will just hit enter LS and
94:28 - then see one.txt has been deleted what
94:31 - if I do n
94:33 - list 2 for 2.xt and
94:37 - so obviously this file will not be
94:39 - deleted
94:41 - so true dot dxt is at as it is okay
94:45 - so this is about a hyphen I like a small
94:47 - eye with which you will get uh prompt
94:51 - about whether you want to delete or not
94:53 - some files okay but you will think about
94:56 - in this case you we were deleting like
94:58 - all these four txt files like in a one
95:02 - single command okay
95:05 - but we were so how we can get uh prompt
95:09 - for this so there is also option for it
95:12 - okay
95:13 - so uh let me first remove all these
95:16 - files
95:19 - 3.xt4.txt okay LS there is no files
95:22 - and again I will just try to create
95:25 - those four files okay now uh there is
95:28 - also one option like hyphen capital i
95:32 - okay what it does when you will go to
95:35 - demo more than three files it will ask
95:37 - you for the confirmation whether you
95:40 - want to delete all those files at once
95:43 - okay or not but it will ask only once
95:46 - okay so how we can do it touch you
95:49 - not sorry one dot txt two dot txt3.txt
95:54 - four dot St here you can see we have
95:58 - how many files four files
96:00 - I will hit enter
96:02 - and again here you will see remove do
96:03 - you want to remove four arguments if you
96:05 - will do yes why then obviously
96:10 - it will be delete and now we will do LS
96:12 - so here you will see there is no any
96:14 - files okay
96:16 - all files has been deleted okay
96:19 - there is also more options like hyphen V
96:23 - okay what it does sorry
96:29 - if I will go with hyphen V option
96:32 - we can like combinely use more than two
96:35 - options together so hyphen we what it
96:37 - does it will show you what is being done
96:38 - okay
96:39 - so let's hit enter I will
96:44 - say yes and here you will see what
96:47 - happened removed one.txt then two dot
96:50 - txt then three then four okay
96:52 - sorry
96:56 - so these are the four files which have
96:58 - been deleted and you have got the
97:00 - information like what was going on uh
97:02 - after uh like hitting this particular
97:04 - command Okay so hyphen we have some only
97:07 - just displays the what is going on okay
97:11 - and now let's move towards like uh
97:14 - directories okay how we can delete uh
97:17 - empty directories or uh like non-empted
97:21 - directory so let me create One Directory
97:24 - hyphen p uh I will choose with the
97:28 - uh A1 A2
97:31 - A3
97:33 - okay so like
97:38 - are you uh you will get like in A1
97:41 - director there will be two in A2 there
97:43 - will be a three directory okay
97:44 - so I will do LS and uh if you want to go
97:47 - in the A1 directory
97:50 - so when you will do LSI you will get the
97:52 - A2 direct okay so in similar way in A2
97:55 - there is A3 now I'll go in the home
97:57 - directory I will clear the screen
97:59 - now I want to remove this particular
98:01 - directory to remove directories which is
98:04 - non-empty like in A1 there is something
98:06 - okay so for this we basically use the r
98:11 - option with r we can use f of f option
98:14 - for Force fully deleting okay but we are
98:17 - not using here it okay
98:19 - so I will just go with the A1 and I will
98:22 - hit enter and all the directors will get
98:24 - deleted okay if I do LS so that you will
98:28 - see there is no A1 now what I will do I
98:31 - will just create again those directories
98:33 - and
98:34 - uh I will run with the iPhone V option
98:38 - okay and here we will see remove
98:40 - directory first A3 then A2 then A1
98:45 - okay uh if you want to use hyphen I
98:49 - option then also you can use
98:51 - a small I
98:53 - it will ask you yes then it will ask you
98:57 - for the next you yes then next you have
99:01 - to do yes so remove directory A1 A2 A2
99:05 - then again y then again for the final
99:08 - one
99:09 - so in this way uh like uh we can use the
99:14 - RM command with the iPhone b i r and
99:17 - these are all options okay now if you
99:20 - want to delete uh like um
99:26 - empty directory
99:28 - okay so this is a empty okay there is
99:31 - nothing into S zero zero you can also do
99:33 - with r option but there is also one more
99:36 - like uh what you can say flag or option
99:40 - is D we basically is the empty directors
99:44 - May loot as 0 0 and it will delete the
99:48 - okay
99:49 - so test user has been deleted now uh
99:52 - again I will show you with the hyphen V
99:54 - option
99:55 - so you can get the like confirmation or
99:58 - there should be no any confusion
100:00 - regarding things okay
100:02 - so hyphen V and yeah zero zero okay so
100:06 - uh that's all for today and I hope you
100:08 - liked it about this like how we can
100:11 - remove files and directories with the RM
100:14 - command as this is a basic class command
100:16 - okay and now today in this video we are
100:18 - going to talk about one of the more
100:19 - basic command that is a CP command Okay
100:22 - so CPS stands for just like copy okay
100:26 - what we will do like basically we will
100:28 - copy files and directories from one
100:30 - directly to another or from one file to
100:33 - another just like in Windows we do right
100:35 - click and click on copy and all so same
100:38 - thing like will happen here but using
100:40 - command line okay or you can say using
100:43 - CP command Okay so let's start the
100:45 - tutorial uh first of all open up the
100:48 - terminal
100:51 - and let me increase the font size for
100:54 - you
100:56 - okay now it's okay and open this files
101:00 - like for your reference okay
101:06 - so here it is
101:10 - and now what I will do LS so here are
101:12 - some files okay
101:14 - uh let me create uh One Directory copy
101:20 - command okay I will move into this
101:24 - particular directory
101:25 - and here also I will move in that
101:27 - directory
101:29 - okay so here you can see uh there is no
101:33 - any files or directors here what I want
101:36 - to create I want to create uh files uh
101:39 - let's create one dot txt
101:45 - I will write this as 1 dot txt file
101:52 - Ctrl D okay
101:54 - here you can see 1.xt file has been
101:56 - created now what if you want to create
101:58 - uh the copy of this particular text file
102:02 - okay so how you can do it
102:05 - so to perform this action we have a
102:07 - basic command that is CP command okay it
102:10 - stands for copy so what we will do in a
102:13 - basic simple way we will just give the
102:15 - file name one dot XT and where do you
102:19 - want to create that particular copy I
102:21 - want to create in the same directory so
102:22 - I will just give the name of that file
102:24 - in which I want to
102:26 - uh like copy that file so anyway you
102:29 - will see 2.xt is not there okay
102:33 - so what will happen in this case like if
102:35 - the file exists so it will overwrite
102:37 - simply overwrite the whatever you have
102:39 - written but if file doesn't exist so it
102:42 - will create and then
102:44 - after that it will copy the content of
102:46 - one dot text into two dot text okay
102:49 - so we're going to do LS and I will try
102:51 - to read 2.t2.txt
102:54 - so here you can see the content of this
102:56 - particular
102:57 - like uh
102:59 - particular one dot txt file
103:02 - okay
103:04 - so this is the like one of the simple
103:06 - way in which we can copy the files and
103:09 - files okay
103:10 - so now uh what I want I want to copy
103:14 - this one dot txt file into some other
103:16 - locations so how we can do it
103:19 - so uh like
103:22 - right now where you are let's check you
103:24 - are in the this home I use copy command
103:28 - okay I will try to split the terminal so
103:31 - that will be
103:33 - uh helpful let me uh like create one
103:36 - more terminal
103:38 - Ctrl shift plus I hope it is visible to
103:41 - you
103:47 - um let me just reduce some size
103:51 - okay
103:54 - so now what I will do I will do LS here
103:57 - okay now uh let's do PWD
104:02 - okay and uh you are in the home ayush
104:06 - right now I will just copy this
104:09 - like
104:12 - path
104:13 - now what I want I want to copy this CP
104:17 - one dot text file
104:20 - at
104:25 - sorry
104:30 - one dot txt file right paste
104:35 - oh my use okay
104:37 - and here I will create two Dot txt
104:42 - so here you can see there is no any two
104:44 - dot X Type kind of file
104:46 - let's hit enter and here you will see
104:49 - let's do LS and here we will you will
104:52 - see two dot txt has been created let me
104:55 - open the like check the content of that
104:58 - particular file
105:00 - so relative this is one dot txt
105:02 - file okay uh like it was a like a little
105:06 - bit like difficult because you will need
105:09 - to give the whole path where you want uh
105:12 - to copy that particular file
105:15 - okay so in this way you can copy this
105:18 - like file so in any location you want
105:21 - you will just need to give the like
105:23 - whole path okay where you want to copy
105:26 - that particular file now one more thing
105:28 - I want to tell you guys
105:30 - let me clear the screen here also I will
105:33 - do lsas okay now what I want I uh like
105:37 - want to copy that file okay but what if
105:40 - two dot txt file already exists
105:44 - okay so what will happen
105:46 - so
105:48 - now what I will do
105:50 - I will
105:53 - add some more
105:55 - text n1.txt
106:00 - some more
106:03 - has been added in this
106:06 - file okay
106:08 - Ctrl d
106:10 - now uh let's check the content of the
106:13 - one dot txt
106:15 - so here you can see this one.txt content
106:18 - and let's check the container 2.txt it
106:20 - should be like as a similar one one.txt
106:23 - okay
106:25 - now what we will need to do I will also
106:28 - need to copy this uh one to text into
106:31 - 2.txt okay so I will just try to
106:36 - hit the like previous command but here
106:39 - what I will use I will just hit the
106:41 - hyphen I option
106:43 - okay why hyphen I option
106:45 - it will just prompt you for file over
106:49 - written thing like if file already
106:52 - exists so it will prompt like whether
106:55 - you want to overwrite the content of one
106:58 - dot txt or not like because there is
107:01 - something else in the 2 dot txt if you
107:04 - will like without hyphen I you will run
107:06 - this command so it will simply overwrite
107:08 - the content of one dot text into two dot
107:10 - txt but using hyphen I what it will do
107:13 - it will just
107:14 - prompt you for your decision whether you
107:18 - want to overwrite or not okay so let's
107:21 - hit enter
107:22 - and here you can see it is asking for
107:24 - overwrite and question mark
107:26 - uh whether yes or no I will just hit yes
107:30 - now I will try to check the content of
107:33 - this 2.xt file
107:35 - so here you can see like it has been
107:37 - copied
107:39 - okay
107:40 - I hope you got it uh how we you can do
107:42 - it also
107:44 - now what if I want to copy like
107:49 - file 1 and file 2 into some other
107:51 - directory
107:53 - okay
107:54 - so
107:56 - let me like check LS
108:00 - so here you can see one dot txt and two
108:02 - dot txt file is there now what I want I
108:06 - want one dot txt
108:09 - into some another directory
108:12 - same here in this the same case if
108:15 - directory exist then it will like uh
108:19 - uh like copy this files if directory
108:22 - doesn't exist then it will create a
108:23 - directory and then after that you will
108:25 - copy that like these files into that
108:27 - particular directory okay
108:30 - so how you can do it
108:34 - uh copy one.ac now directory name so uh
108:38 - uh what you can write
108:42 - copied files
108:46 - okay let me hit enter
108:50 - okay is not a director I think I will
108:52 - need to use iPhone R option
108:55 - Maybe
109:03 - okay
109:14 - uh let me create a directory copied
109:16 - files
109:21 - and now let me try to copy this uh
109:26 - finds it to it okay okay sorry
109:30 - uh let's check out this I will move into
109:33 - this directory
109:34 - and I will unless okay okay now now this
109:38 - files has been completed so in this case
109:40 - like it is not uh creating directory if
109:44 - that directory doesn't exist
109:46 - okay
109:49 - so uh like in this way you can like copy
109:52 - uh like more than one files or into some
109:57 - another
109:58 - directory okay
110:01 - now uh one more option is there like if
110:04 - you want to copy
110:06 - uh like one directly through some
110:08 - another directory you want to make a
110:10 - copy of directories okay so how you can
110:12 - do it I will move into the
110:15 - home directory
110:17 - let me clear the screen and then LS okay
110:23 - so what I want to I want this copy
110:25 - command the copy of this
110:28 - copy command directory
110:29 - so I will use CP hyphen R for recursive
110:32 - so it is used for the directory copies
110:38 - so how you can do it
110:41 - you will give the
110:44 - first the this directory name and
110:47 - another directory in which you want
110:49 - so
110:51 - I will use copy command
110:55 - V2
110:56 - and hit enter
110:58 - and h2ls and here you will see copy
111:01 - command B2 has been created now let's
111:03 - move into this particular directory
111:07 - and LS so here you can see the light
111:10 - directors has been well I copied okay
111:13 - so in this way uh you can play with the
111:16 - copy command and all okay so that's all
111:19 - for today's video now in this video we
111:21 - will talk about uh like one of the basic
111:23 - command that is MV command it like it
111:26 - basically stands for move so basically
111:28 - in this video we will talk about how we
111:30 - can move files from one location to
111:32 - another or also you can say like how we
111:36 - can move directory from one location to
111:38 - another location okay
111:40 - so today in this video we are gonna
111:42 - learn about this I like how we can move
111:44 - files from one location to another so
111:46 - first of all let me open up the terminal
111:51 - now let me just to increase the font
111:53 - size for you guys so it should be
111:55 - visible to you and I will just open up
111:57 - these files
111:59 - for your reference so whatever we will
112:02 - perform in it will be visible to you
112:04 - guys okay
112:08 - okay
112:09 - so now what I will do first of all I
112:13 - will create One Directory mkdir move
112:18 - command okay
112:20 - and now what we will need to do Let Me
112:24 - Clear
112:25 - I will move into that particular
112:27 - directory and I will create one file
112:30 - touch
112:33 - file one dot txt we will create okay
112:37 - and let's touch file 1.txt okay
112:41 - uh
112:43 - also let me uh no wait a minute
112:49 - I will try to create a file with for cat
112:52 - command because I have to write
112:54 - something in it
112:59 - this is file one
113:03 - Ctrl D okay now just save
113:07 - what we will do I have to move this file
113:11 - one dot txt
113:12 - okay
113:14 - file one dot txt from this move would
113:17 - move command directly to some another
113:20 - directory that is I have to move this on
113:23 - to support desktop okay
113:25 - so now what I will do uh
113:28 - first of all I will open up one more
113:31 - terminal
113:32 - and
113:36 - I will move into the CD desktop
113:39 - okay I will do PWD I will check the like
113:43 - path of that particular desktop where it
113:46 - is
113:47 - so here you can see
113:49 - home I use desktop okay so now what we
113:53 - will do
113:55 - I will use here
113:57 - MB
113:59 - LX transform move I have to move
114:02 - file1.txtree
114:04 - to home
114:08 - ayush
114:10 - desktop and here what you can do like
114:13 - like this command is also useful like
114:17 - changing
114:18 - the name like we can also rename files
114:20 - okay but here I'm going to use only file
114:24 - dot txt okay
114:27 - and I will hit enter and
114:30 - on the desktop I will do here LS so here
114:33 - you will see file.txt has been
114:36 - like created okay
114:38 - or
114:40 - you can see here also on the desktop
114:43 - I think it is
114:47 - here here you can see the file dot text
114:50 - has been
114:51 - created okay
114:55 - so this is the basics of how we can move
114:58 - files from one location to another now
115:01 - like this command is also useful in
115:03 - renaming files okay so if I will do LSL
115:06 - so there is nothing because we have
115:07 - already moved it let's create another
115:09 - file
115:11 - cat
115:12 - file to
115:15 - Dot dxt
115:16 - this is
115:18 - file to
115:20 - okay
115:21 - endless and now what I want I want to
115:24 - rename this file file two I want to make
115:26 - it file 3.
115:27 - so we can do it for me file to
115:30 - same
115:32 - here I will just file 3.txt and I will
115:36 - do LS and here you will see the name of
115:37 - the file 2 has been changed to
115:40 - file three now let's check the content
115:43 - of file 3 whether it is same or not so
115:45 - cat file three so it is this is file two
115:48 - okay
115:50 - so in this way you can also rename the
115:52 - like file names okay
115:55 - I hope you got it uh now let me tell you
115:58 - one more another thing like
116:00 - if suppose here is file dot txt okay on
116:05 - the desktop
116:06 - and uh you want to move that file one
116:10 - which is here
116:12 - to move into this particular directory
116:15 - or particular location so if already
116:18 - file one dot txt like
116:22 - exist here so what will happen when we
116:26 - will like try to move files from this
116:30 - location to this location with the same
116:32 - and then it will overwrite so to
116:34 - overcome overcome this issue what we
116:36 - will use we will use hyphen I command
116:39 - not command hyphenite flag we will use
116:42 - okay first what I will do I will
116:46 - uh change the file name to file 1 not
116:50 - file on file dot text I will change
116:54 - LS okay now what I will do MBA file dot
116:58 - txt then
117:01 - home
117:02 - ayush
117:04 - desktop and again file Dot
117:08 - txt and here I will use iPhone I option
117:14 - and here you can see over I do you want
117:16 - to override this particular file which
117:18 - it is it is asking so I can say yes or
117:21 - no but before let's check the content of
117:23 - this file
117:25 - this is file 180 it is showing now I
117:27 - will do yes
117:29 - and uh
117:32 - hit enter
117:35 - and now I will
117:38 - again
117:42 - check the content of this file so here
117:44 - you can see this is file to
117:46 - okay I hope it is visible to you yeah
117:48 - this is this file 2 is the now the like
117:52 - uh decent content of this file because
117:55 - it is overwritten okay
117:58 - now next uh what are we I have to do
118:02 - I will try to move
118:05 - like uh some files into one particular
118:08 - directory okay
118:10 - so what I will do I will create two
118:13 - files
118:15 - one dot txt
118:16 - 2.txt
118:19 - now let's create a DOT text also okay
118:21 - now you can see LS so these are the
118:24 - three by which we have created now I
118:26 - will
118:27 - make a directory here on the desktop
118:29 - mkdir
118:32 - move files
118:35 - okay now what I will do MB
118:39 - 1.txt 2 Dot txt 3 Dot txt
118:43 - into the directory home
118:47 - ayush
118:48 - desktop on desktop.vm
118:52 - move files we'll hit enter
118:56 - and we will do lso here we can see there
118:58 - is no any files here now I will move
119:01 - into the move files and I will do LS so
119:04 - here you can see all the files has been
119:05 - and I moved at this particular locations
119:08 - okay
119:09 - so this is the another way to like
119:12 - moving files from one location to
119:14 - another like from
119:16 - one location to any kind of directory in
119:19 - which you want okay now moving forward
119:22 - uh what we can do like how you can copy
119:26 - like One Directory to another location
119:30 - okay or renaming it okay
119:34 - so let me go back here and
119:37 - now at desktop here you can see move
119:39 - files and one directory that is test
119:42 - directory okay
119:44 - now what I want I want to First rename
119:49 - this file or this directory
119:52 - so move files I will try to rename it
119:57 - m files
120:00 - now let's so here you can see the like
120:03 - move files have been changed to Empire
120:05 - now what now I want to move this M5 into
120:08 - this tester directory
120:10 - uh so what I can do on a MB
120:15 - m files
120:17 - and in the test
120:20 - enter LS there is no m files here now
120:24 - see the change reacted to test now let's
120:27 - do LS
120:30 - and here you can see m files has been
120:33 - moved at this particular location or you
120:35 - can say add the test directory
120:38 - okay
120:39 - so in this way uh like you can move
120:41 - files from one location to another or
120:44 - from One Directory to another or how you
120:47 - can also rename files and also in this
120:51 - video you'll learn about it
120:53 - so today we will stop here and we will
120:55 - meet in the next two videos so thank you
120:57 - thank you for watching and please if you
120:59 - have any queries then you can ask us in
121:01 - the comment section okay hello guys and
121:03 - welcome back to the channel this is
121:05 - ayush
121:06 - and now in this video here is the test
121:08 - for you guys till the topics which we
121:10 - have covered till now I think till every
121:12 - command we have covered so in this test
121:15 - we have approx 15 questions which will
121:17 - be given by you and after that you will
121:19 - get the
121:21 - each like one point for every correct
121:24 - answer and you will get the link of this
121:27 - form in the description of this video
121:29 - okay
121:30 - so best of luck for it and I hope you
121:32 - will do great and we will meet in the
121:35 - next video okay bye
121:39 - and on this video we'll cover the zip
121:41 - command okay
121:43 - so basically uh as you are aware of zip
121:45 - like widget files to compress the size
121:47 - of that particular directory or
121:49 - particular file which we use okay
121:51 - suppose you want to transfer a file of
121:53 - 500 MB to your friend okay
121:55 - but uh you want to compress that file
121:59 - and after that you want to send it to
122:01 - that your friend so when you zip that
122:04 - file so the size will be automatically
122:06 - decreased okay
122:07 - so that's why we use the zip command so
122:09 - basically in the Linux we will use the
122:11 - zip command okay for zipping the files
122:14 - and directories okay but in
122:18 - windows or you use on that particular
122:21 - GUI to zip the files okay so now in this
122:24 - video what we are going to do we will
122:26 - first of all create a One Directory
122:29 - mkdl zip and let's move into this
122:32 - directory
122:33 - and also maybe zip has been created yes
122:35 - here it is now what we will do
122:38 - I'll create multiple files
122:40 - uh
122:42 - one dot txt 2 dot txt three dot txt okay
122:48 - so basically on in a simple way how you
122:50 - can zip file without any option so this
122:52 - is a just simple like you zip and the
122:55 - file name which you want to give to that
122:57 - particular
122:59 - uh ZIP file so I am giving it the file
123:01 - dot zip and the particular files which
123:04 - you want to
123:07 - which you want to add in that particular
123:12 - zip file okay
123:14 - so now what we can do uh I will just hit
123:16 - uh enter
123:18 - and here you can see file.za Facebook
123:20 - data now in this particular uh
123:23 - therefore you can see one.txt has been
123:25 - added okay so but what if you want to
123:28 - add multiple files okay
123:31 - if you want to add multi multiple files
123:33 - in your uh that particular
123:36 - this zipper so how you can do it so for
123:39 - this what you will do I am I'm going to
123:41 - create another zip file zip file to dot
123:45 - step
123:46 - one dot txt 2 Dot txt
123:50 - 3 Dot txt and again here you can see
123:54 - file to dot zip in this we will get
123:56 - actually three files okay one two three
123:59 - dot extra we are getting here
124:01 - so this is the way of zipping multiple
124:04 - files together okay in a particular uh
124:08 - ZIP file in which you want so now what
124:10 - we are going to do I am again going to
124:12 - create some more files
124:15 - Touch 4 Dot txt 5.txt
124:19 - dot txt okay
124:22 - so now what I want to do I am going to
124:24 - zip
124:25 - 4 Dot txt and file three dot zip file
124:30 - okay so the option is one of the option
124:35 - of the zip command is hyphen U option
124:37 - which we can use to like
124:39 - uh add some other files in that
124:42 - particular zip file uh it means like in
124:46 - the file 3.0 right now we have only four
124:49 - dot txt okay so what I am going to do I
124:53 - will add 5 and 6 also without tampering
124:56 - four
124:57 - so the there is a hyphen new option in
125:00 - the zip command okay which we can use to
125:05 - perform that particular action so I am
125:08 - going to add here 5 dot txt and also
125:11 - 6.txt
125:12 - and now I will open up this zip file and
125:16 - here you can see four five six has been
125:18 - added Okay so so we will cover unzip in
125:21 - next video and that's why I'm going I'm
125:23 - showing you like this okay that's why
125:25 - I'm not unzipping it with the CMD okay
125:28 - so in this way you can add uh other
125:30 - files also
125:31 - and one more option is there like uh
125:34 - hyphen M option so what it does it's
125:37 - basically like it will zip the file and
125:40 - it will also delete that particular file
125:42 - sometimes in case you don't want to uh
125:45 - like um what we can say keep that
125:48 - particular file okay in your desk or to
125:51 - save your space or something like that
125:52 - you can think of it so how we can do it
125:55 - uh like here is LS we I'm going to do
125:58 - and here is the 6 dot till one two six
126:00 - dot text is file now what I'm going to
126:03 - do is zip hyphen M I will
126:07 - use five four dot zip
126:10 - and I will add a suppose 4.txt 5.6 Dot
126:15 - txt
126:16 - hit enter adding all those things and
126:19 - here you can see all the 4 to 6.txt file
126:21 - has been deleted and here in the file
126:24 - 4.0 we will get the four five six dot
126:27 - txt files so using iPhone you can uh
126:31 - like uh ZIP that all files and also uh
126:36 - you can delete that files to save your
126:38 - space Hamilton so you will not need to
126:40 - delete that file after the zipping of
126:43 - all that things okay so now moving
126:45 - forward what we can do so uh suppose if
126:48 - you have other directories also like
126:50 - with 30 XD files you have some other
126:52 - directory so how you can do it how you
126:54 - can zip that also so you can do that in
126:58 - a recursive manner like using iPhone or
127:00 - option so first of all what I'm going to
127:02 - do I will just create some other
127:04 - directories like let's create test okay
127:09 - I have created test directory
127:11 - and you have to like
127:15 - what you can say you have to add one to
127:18 - three dot XD files also and also test
127:22 - uh directory in one zip file how you can
127:25 - do it you have to just use hyphen R
127:27 - option so hyphen are option what it does
127:30 - it basically work as a recursive manner
127:32 - like it will uh ZIP your directory and
127:36 - also files which you you will use so
127:39 - let's uh
127:43 - and then what we can do one dot txt 2
127:46 - Dot txt
127:47 - free Dot txt and the name of the file
127:52 - not file directory
127:54 - enter and
127:58 - where it is
128:02 - and here you can see all of your files
128:04 - has been added into that particular
128:07 - zip file okay
128:10 - so in this way you can add some other
128:14 - like more than files and directories in
128:16 - one zip file using a single command or
128:17 - using iPhone R option mostly it happens
128:20 - mostly we use it in like
128:23 - in our window system like we have
128:26 - multiple files in One Directory is also
128:29 - some other directory so you can
128:30 - basically like use it in this case
128:33 - more important thing the and the last
128:35 - one the last option which we will see
128:37 - together is hyphen e option okay it
128:40 - basically stands for encrypt so what it
128:42 - does
128:43 - uh
128:45 - let me
128:47 - like what I will do I will add this
128:49 - 1.txt file into one zip file with a
128:52 - password okay basically it will create a
128:55 - zip file within password so how you can
128:58 - do it zip
128:59 - I will write password
129:03 - dot zip into
129:05 - one dot txt like one dot text I want to
129:09 - zip into this particular
129:11 - file password Dot zip I will use hyphen
129:14 - e option
129:16 - and here it will ask for me to enter the
129:19 - password which you want I will use
129:21 - something okay
129:24 - ayush and here you can see adding
129:26 - one.txt is stored in that particular zip
129:28 - file so where it is uh this one password
129:30 - dot zip
129:32 - okay
129:34 - let me open it uh
129:37 - yeah and now here one dot txt and like
129:40 - as you can see here clock type also like
129:43 - it will me you know it prompt me to
129:46 - enter the password now I will enter
129:50 - and here you can see one dot txt has
129:53 - been unlocked as there is nothing so
129:54 - it's showing like nothing here okay we
129:57 - have not written anything in that
129:58 - one.txt file okay so uh that's all for
130:02 - today uh I hope you got it how you can
130:04 - zip files and also how you can save
130:07 - multiple files together in a single file
130:09 - with hyphen e option like if you want to
130:13 - to like protect uh or zip some sensitive
130:16 - files and you have to send it to some
130:18 - other person you don't want to disclose
130:20 - that particular file so you can use
130:21 - hypheny option also in that case
130:24 - so that's all for doing now in this
130:26 - video we will start with the most uh
130:28 - basic command that is unzip command okay
130:31 - so uh first how we will start uh I will
130:34 - create a One Directory
130:37 - that is uh sorry mkdir zip
130:42 - and I will move into that particular
130:44 - directory and I will create some files
130:47 - one dot txt
130:49 - uh so sorry to Dot txt
130:54 - 3.txt okay now these three files has
130:56 - been created now what I like to do I
130:59 - want to zip all these three files in uh
131:04 - one particular
131:06 - zip file okay
131:07 - so
131:09 - 1.2 XT 2.txt
131:13 - 3.txtree and I want to zip all these in
131:15 - a single file that is
131:18 - files dot zip okay all has been added I
131:23 - will do LS here you can see files.zip
131:25 - and for your reference I will open up
131:27 - this directory and here you can see all
131:29 - these files and the files are there in
131:31 - the entire in this directory so now in
131:33 - this particular we are going to study
131:35 - about uh unchip how you can unzip these
131:39 - particular files and particular zip
131:41 - files okay so the most basic and
131:44 - simple uh like command that is unzip we
131:50 - used to like extract files of this
131:53 - particular zip file so how we can do it
131:56 - we will just use unzip and the
131:57 - particular file name
131:59 - sorry
132:02 - and here you can see it is asking me for
132:04 - do you want to replace or not okay so I
132:06 - will just hit Ctrl C right now
132:09 - okay uh because I don't want to create
132:13 - any confusion for you guys first what I
132:15 - will do I will just create all uh remove
132:17 - all these one dot txt
132:20 - 2.xtend3.txt files I have now deleted
132:23 - all these files now what now I will use
132:26 - unzip and the files.zip and it will
132:29 - simply like extract all the files which
132:32 - are present in this file short zip for
132:34 - your reference let me open it
132:36 - so you can see what are the files is
132:39 - present so here you can see these are
132:41 - the three files which are present in
132:42 - this particular zip file so I will hit
132:45 - this command
132:46 - and done we you have simply extracted
132:48 - all the files of that particular file
132:50 - through the file okay so this is a very
132:53 - simple way to extract files and now
132:56 - moving forward uh suppose like uh you
133:00 - want to use these files and these
133:02 - 1.2.3.txt in some kind of another
133:04 - locations suppose in many cases you want
133:07 - to store these files in some other
133:08 - directories okay so how you can do it uh
133:12 - without like
133:15 - extracting all these files in the same
133:17 - direction which your files.jips so but
133:19 - you can extract this file in some other
133:22 - directories also so you can do it this
133:23 - is very simple now what I will do uh I
133:26 - will open up a new terminal or
133:29 - okay let me open up a new terminal
133:39 - uh let me include a little bit of font
133:41 - size for you and
133:44 - I will create
133:47 - one folder that extracted files okay
133:52 - I'll move into this folder and I will
133:54 - copy the whole path that is home I use
133:57 - extracted files
133:59 - okay
134:01 - in this terminal you can copy by Ctrl
134:05 - shift C
134:06 - okay I will just move it here
134:10 - now what if you want to like unzip the
134:13 - files in some particular directory so
134:15 - for this if we use basically hyphen D
134:18 - option okay in this we will provide the
134:20 - path of that particular
134:26 - particular directory where you want to
134:28 - store that particular extracted files so
134:32 - unzip and then the file name which you
134:34 - want that is files.zip and hyphen D and
134:37 - then Ctrl shift V and here we want our
134:40 - files in this extracted files directory
134:43 - okay
134:44 - now what we will do here I will do the
134:47 - stylus in this particular terminal and
134:49 - here you can see all of these files has
134:52 - been like extracted in this particular
134:55 - directory so in this way also like you
134:58 - can store your extractor file in some
135:01 - kind of another directory okay so this
135:03 - is another simple trick
135:06 - like which you should know about it
135:10 - and also there are many options like
135:13 - suppose in case what happens you have
135:16 - extracted your files uh the file already
135:19 - but sometimes also what happens you
135:22 - accidentally click on it so in this case
135:25 - in Linux what happens when you try to
135:28 - like unzip files and in the same
135:30 - directory or you can say in another
135:33 - another
135:33 - so here you can see we have already
135:36 - these files one two three dot txt what
135:39 - what where what will happen when I will
135:41 - try to hit the same command again so it
135:44 - will ask me for do you want to override
135:45 - these files or none or nothing or else
135:47 - okay I said I will say yes okay
135:51 - and again it is asking for 1.2 XT again
135:55 - I will say yes again for 2 dot TX 10 3
135:58 - dot text okay yes so again these all the
136:01 - files has been replaced
136:04 - okay in case if I would made any changes
136:07 - in this well then I will definitely
136:09 - choose no because I don't want to create
136:12 - any kind of problem for myself okay
136:16 - so like this is the basic uh options
136:19 - which we can use to unzip files and also
136:22 - uh like you should know about one more
136:24 - option that is uh hyphen Q option what
136:27 - is it okay I Will Show You by uh first
136:30 - what I will do I will remove the all
136:32 - these 1 Dot and all these files from
136:35 - this directory
136:38 - okay
136:39 - so here you can see there's only five
136:41 - Starship what basically in simple case
136:44 - what happens when I do
136:46 - it will show me these messages okay
136:49 - extracting these files extracting 2.
136:52 - text extracting three dot txt uh in some
136:55 - cases we don't want this kind of
136:57 - information because we know it will
136:59 - simply extract the files so for this
137:01 - what we can use we can use just uh
137:03 - hyphen Q option
137:06 - iPhone q and then
137:09 - file storage zip it will just avoid like
137:12 - it will not print any kind of extra
137:14 - things
137:15 - so uh for before hitting this command
137:19 - I'll try to again remove all those files
137:21 - and now
137:23 - I will use iPhone key option
137:27 - and done so in this case we didn't get
137:30 - any kind of information or any kind of
137:33 - message like whether this file has been
137:35 - extracted or not okay now again let me
137:38 - remove it and I will again tell you one
137:40 - more option that is hyphen L option
137:41 - basically if you are aware of Ls command
137:43 - so you will definitely know about LS
137:46 - hyphen L option which basically like
137:49 - list all the uh means list of files in a
137:54 - long format okay you can say like we get
137:56 - many kind of things like date time user
137:58 - guest not guest groups user groups
138:01 - access time modify time we get all those
138:04 - kind of information and simply uh you
138:06 - can say permissions also like we will
138:08 - have a separate lecture permissions okay
138:11 - so now what we can do on J python L and
138:14 - again I will try to unzip this files uh
138:16 - it is looking so much like
138:19 - so much stuff are there let me clear
138:21 - first string screen now again I will
138:23 - write NG by funnel and then file store
138:25 - ZIP and here you can see the more extra
138:28 - information about the extracted files
138:31 - you can see the length the length is 0
138:33 - and
138:35 - date time name all these titles all
138:39 - these things okay so it basically
138:41 - doesn't extract but it simply shows you
138:44 - the whatever the files are present in
138:46 - the particular
138:47 - uh zip files okay
138:51 - so that's it for today now in this video
138:53 - we are going to cover the most important
138:55 - topic of how the Linux series that is
138:57 - the permissions okay
138:58 - so uh in this video we will cover the
139:01 - console which slides inside this
139:02 - particular topic and uh commands we will
139:05 - cover in the next video okay
139:07 - so basically uh let me tell you about
139:09 - the permissions I hope you may be aware
139:11 - of it uh but still let me tell you like
139:14 - um
139:15 - I will tell you with one of the example
139:17 - with a real life example uh suppose you
139:19 - have a PC and you are the administrator
139:21 - of that particular PC and you have some
139:23 - other users like your brother or you can
139:25 - or your sister okay and you have some
139:28 - kind of files okay which you don't want
139:30 - to show those files to that particular
139:31 - user particular your brother okay so in
139:34 - this case what you will do you will
139:35 - specify a particular permission to that
139:38 - file so that file should not visible or
139:41 - should not accessible to other user
139:44 - so in this way we can set permissions to
139:49 - the files or directories or whatever you
139:51 - want so that should not be accessible to
139:54 - other users or other person okay or you
139:57 - want your profiles to like keep it
139:59 - secret or keep it private you can say
140:02 - so uh I will tell you with the a diagram
140:06 - also so that it will be easy to
140:09 - understand for you guys
140:10 - so here you can see you here is the
140:13 - administrator that you
140:15 - okay
140:18 - and uh
140:23 - suppose here is your brother uh your
140:27 - brother okay or so study you can see
140:31 - and also you have some files also
140:35 - that is
140:38 - I will name it as a
140:40 - private files
140:42 - okay
140:43 - and
140:46 - this one
140:49 - and from this to this
140:52 - you have like you will have the access
140:57 - and your brother will not have the
140:59 - access for it
141:02 - not access okay so in this way you can
141:06 - just understand like this is the private
141:08 - file okay you have the administrator you
141:10 - have the access for it but your brother
141:12 - or sister uh if they want to access this
141:15 - particular file they will get the error
141:18 - like permission denied or something like
141:19 - that okay
141:20 - so in this way permission like you can
141:23 - get the scenario of the how permission
141:25 - work okay
141:26 - so now uh in our Linux operating system
141:30 - or you can say Ubuntu
141:33 - uh sorry
141:36 - I will show you the permissions Okay so
141:40 - I hope you are aware of Ls command so
141:42 - this command basically doesn't so much
141:45 - information about the what are the
141:47 - permission what is the size who is the
141:49 - user who is the group all this thing it
141:51 - does also but when we will do LSI funnel
141:53 - then it basically like
141:55 - what we can say long listing description
141:58 - of the files and directories okay
142:01 - wait a minute
142:06 - so in this way
142:08 - here you can see there are multiple
142:10 - columns so I like you will think first
142:12 - like what are these things so I'm not
142:14 - getting anything
142:15 - but here you can see like this is First
142:18 - Column is just for permissions next
142:21 - column is for this is the hard links
142:23 - which we will cover in other videos okay
142:25 - and this is the user who is the user web
142:28 - access of that particular directory and
142:31 - who are the groups and this is the file
142:33 - size date modification date and time
142:36 - these things are there and this is
142:37 - obviously the
142:38 - directory name
142:40 - so right now in this video we don't have
142:42 - to focus on all these other columns like
142:44 - user group we will have a separate video
142:47 - when at the time we use occasion all
142:48 - these things but now in this video we
142:51 - have to only focus on these particular
142:53 - things like only on the First Column
142:55 - what is the
142:57 - drwx WXR what are these things so we
143:00 - will cover
143:02 - now in this video okay
143:06 - so
143:09 - I hope you got it
143:11 - now what I will do
143:19 - increase the font size first
143:22 - let it be 18 not 18.
143:27 - uh
143:28 - 24 yeah
143:35 - uh wait a minute
143:38 - yes first uh I will write the rwx okay
143:44 - again similar thing is we have to do
143:48 - as WX and RW X I will tell you one by
143:55 - one what is these things so basically R
143:57 - what is r
143:59 - R stands for read
144:02 - and uh
144:05 - we have
144:10 - W stands for
144:14 - right
144:16 - okay
144:18 - and x x stands for
144:24 - execute
144:26 - okay
144:30 - so these are the some like notations RW
144:34 - access for the permission in our Linux
144:36 - operating system that is R stands for
144:38 - read it just means suppose you have a
144:40 - file and you want to give that file only
144:42 - the read access to some kind some other
144:44 - user
144:45 - similarly in kind of your brother's
144:47 - sister okay suppose here is you like
144:49 - some documentation you have and
144:53 - you want to show it to your brother so
144:55 - you can give only the read permission to
144:57 - your brother or to your other user like
144:59 - he can only read these files okay
145:02 - and what is the right permission suppose
145:04 - when you will give the read and write
145:06 - permission to this particular
145:07 - documentation file so in this case
145:10 - suppose uh they are in the same project
145:12 - with you
145:14 - so what will happen they can change
145:16 - these files also according to him and
145:18 - the rwx is nothing but the read write
145:21 - execute it means you will give the all
145:23 - the permissions like execute permission
145:25 - we basically use for the some kind of
145:27 - scripts and all these things like when
145:29 - we will cover basket scripting so you
145:31 - will get to know about this dot sh
145:33 - files and all or we can say dot Pi also
145:36 - for python files okay
145:39 - so these are the things for in the read
145:41 - write execute so I hope you got it what
145:44 - is read what is right what is execute so
145:47 - now here comes why I have written these
145:49 - three three three so here is the reason
145:51 - behind it the first section is only for
145:55 - the user the user uh whoever is the user
145:59 - they will have the like these permission
146:01 - right now they have read write execute
146:02 - all these three permissions okay
146:05 - and next is for group
146:10 - okay
146:13 - and uh next is for
146:17 - uh wait a minute
146:23 - next is for home
146:25 - other or you can say some other books or
146:29 - some other on net you can get like other
146:33 - world or anything else like
146:35 - okay
146:37 - so uh these are the 3D permission total
146:40 - nine nine permission we have three for
146:42 - user other three for group and other
146:45 - three for other
146:47 - like other world okay so here you can
146:49 - see in our system uh I will make a
146:53 - directory so it will be visible to you
146:58 - and I will try to
147:01 - create One Directory test one
147:06 - and uh
147:11 - Touch file dot txt LS Okay so
147:16 - like here you can see I've created two
147:18 - files like with when you will apply this
147:21 - semicolon then you can write multiple
147:23 - commands in one single line okay I hope
147:25 - you you got to learn new things okay
147:28 - so now I will do uh LSI funnel
147:32 - so here you can see uh the file
147:35 - permissions for uh user
147:38 - and D is for directory and this hyphen
147:41 - is for only for the files okay
147:44 - there are some also other notations
147:45 - which will cover in advanced video okay
147:48 - when we will executing commands Okay
147:52 - so here you can see rwx
147:54 - rwx that is how much it
147:57 - uh that is 6 and again r w x okay
148:02 - so here in place of w you can see that
148:06 - is hyphen means it means zero like uh
148:08 - that other user is not having any
148:10 - permission to write anything inside the
148:13 - directory okay
148:15 - and this rwx rwx the user and the group
148:19 - have all the permissions okay I hope you
148:22 - got it
148:24 - so uh
148:27 - now what we have to do uh now I will
148:30 - tell you about some kind of like uh
148:33 - you can say numeric representation like
148:35 - how we can represent the uh what we can
148:38 - say
148:39 - permissions of this
148:41 - so basically what happens this is in
148:45 - this uh
148:46 - foreign
148:47 - wait a minute
148:49 - for R we basically gave a number that is
148:52 - read
148:54 - wait a minute I will write here only
149:00 - here for R we give particular number
149:02 - that is 4 okay
149:05 - and for
149:09 - right we give it to
149:12 - and for one
149:15 - we give it
149:17 - for execute we give it one so overall
149:20 - when you will add all these numbers so
149:23 - for all suppose if you want to give all
149:25 - the permission to some kind of file so
149:28 - in this case you will provide this 777
149:33 - okay it means you are providing seven
149:37 - for user also 7 for group also other
149:43 - seven four
149:45 - other also and suppose uh and also one
149:50 - more is remaining that is zero
149:52 - what is 0 0 is nothing for no permission
149:57 - okay if you will give it 0 to some other
150:01 - like
150:03 - for any case you will give it a zero
150:05 - then
150:08 - they will not have any kind of
150:10 - permissions okay now Suppose there is a
150:14 - file that is uh suppose this
150:16 - documentation file
150:18 - I want to give this as a only
150:21 - uh read and write permission to the no
150:25 - rewrite execute permission to the
150:28 - user so in case of user I will write 4
150:33 - plus 2 plus 1 that is I will write 7 for
150:37 - the user okay
150:40 - and similarly for
150:43 - group
150:45 - what for group I just want to give them
150:48 - only
150:49 - what we can say uh write permissions
150:52 - okay
150:54 - so I will just give it them two
150:57 - okay it basically means zero
151:01 - plus 2 plus 0 like it will automatically
151:05 - like uh accept like uh
151:07 - that particular group has only write
151:09 - permissions okay
151:13 - and for
151:15 - other users suppose uh you want to give
151:17 - it as
151:19 - for other I want to give them as six
151:22 - like four plus two plus zero so they
151:26 - will only have the read and write
151:29 - permissions okay
151:33 - so overall what we will write
151:36 - we will write 7 2
151:39 - seven two and
151:42 - six okay
151:47 - all right now I don't want a mouse with
151:49 - me so I'm getting this problem okay
151:54 - so now so to give the permission to like
151:58 - uh for user you want to give them all
152:00 - the permission so we can you can give it
152:02 - simply as seven for group suppose you
152:05 - want to give only the right permission
152:06 - you can give it to or suppose you want
152:09 - to give other or like only uh read and
152:13 - write permission so you can give it 4
152:14 - plus 236. so the overall like uh number
152:19 - which you will provide in the CH mode
152:21 - command that is the
152:24 - uh 726
152:26 - so what uh when you don't want to give
152:28 - any permission to the other user so in
152:31 - this case you can
152:32 - give it them as a zero suppose uh the
152:35 - same scenario like you want to give
152:37 - group S2 so what you can do that is
152:39 - seven to zero simple
152:42 - so uh I hope you got it the concept of
152:44 - rewrite execute and how this is divided
152:47 - like r w x r double x r double X what is
152:50 - this
152:51 - three like we have
152:54 - like say permission for read write
152:57 - execute for one user then for group for
153:00 - other and also I hope you got this
153:03 - representation of numeric okay
153:06 - in binary also we can represent like for
153:08 - four I think we represent
153:10 - uh one double zero and yeah let me write
153:15 - it for binary also
153:23 - so for binary we write one double zero
153:26 - and uh for four for two I think we write
153:30 - uh uh it's 0 1 0 it may be uh I hope I
153:36 - am correct
153:38 - uh wait a minute
153:43 - so for two what we write uh zero one
153:46 - zero and the for one uh it's I think
153:50 - zero zero one
153:52 - should be
153:54 - zero zero one
153:57 - okay
153:58 - so uh let me check it once also I don't
154:01 - want to like share raw information with
154:03 - you guys uh 4 in binary
154:09 - it's one double zero okay
154:16 - yeah here you can see one double zero
154:18 - and for two it should be zero one zero
154:22 - yeah U zero and zero is there
154:25 - uh
154:28 - we can get like zero one zero it is
154:30 - there and for one we will get uh
154:33 - yeah zero one okay
154:36 - so this is correct so in binary also you
154:39 - got to learn about how we can write in
154:41 - the binary also
154:43 - so uh that's all for today's video I
154:45 - hope you liked and now in this video we
154:46 - are going to cover the one command that
154:48 - is the change mode or you can say CH
154:50 - mode also basically this command is used
154:54 - to change the permissions so this thing
154:56 - we have covered in our last video okay
154:59 - so now a particular CH mode is one of
155:02 - the command that we basically use to
155:04 - change the permissions of the certain
155:06 - files or directory you can say okay if
155:09 - you don't want to provide a permission
155:12 - to any user or any groups or anything
155:15 - any other user whom you don't want to
155:18 - provide access or want to provide Excel
155:20 - then you can use this particular command
155:22 - okay
155:23 - so now in this video uh first of all let
155:26 - me increase the size so it will be
155:27 - visible to you so now what we have to do
155:29 - I will create one directory that is
155:35 - access dni like this
155:43 - now what I have to do I will create two
155:45 - folders or you can see directors also
155:50 - secret one
155:53 - see create two
155:56 - and one file that is
156:02 - private dot txt okay
156:07 - now you can so I have done a list so
156:10 - these are all the files or the active
156:12 - which you have created now when I will
156:14 - do wireless iPhone so you can get these
156:16 - information of the long format in the
156:18 - long format okay
156:19 - so I hope you are aware of this what is
156:21 - drwx
156:23 - okay and what is this iPhone I hope you
156:26 - but let me tell you one more time like
156:28 - what are these things
156:30 - so basically hyphen is for files are
156:32 - this for read so if you will provide
156:34 - read permission then you can read that
156:37 - file then if you provide write code then
156:39 - you can write your favorite execute and
156:41 - that file will be executable okay
156:44 - so for uh form like in-depth information
156:48 - you can watch our previous video on the
156:50 - permissions okay
156:51 - so now what we have to do uh
156:55 - today in this video what we will go uh
156:57 - going to do like we will change the
156:59 - permissions of certain files or
157:01 - directories okay
157:02 - so now uh the command which I was
157:05 - talking about that is CH mode it's
157:07 - basically stands for change mode okay
157:10 - change mode of what files or directors
157:12 - so we have learned already learned the
157:15 - uh like two
157:17 - representations of this uh
157:19 - permissions like one is a uh numerical
157:23 - and one is alphabetical like when you
157:25 - will do rwx it is alphabetical and four
157:28 - to one is for
157:30 - what numerical okay
157:33 - so now what I will do I will first clear
157:37 - the screen and let's open it so now you
157:40 - can see the file permission of this
157:42 - private.txt
157:44 - so this is file and this is this like
157:49 - file has not any executable permission
157:52 - of this of the user
157:54 - or any other like on group also and for
157:58 - others it has only read permission okay
158:02 - so now what I have to do I will try to
158:06 - add
158:07 - executable permissions to this
158:10 - particular file
158:12 - okay
158:13 - so how can I do it so the most and
158:16 - simple approach is CH mode
158:21 - plus plus means basically when you want
158:24 - to add permissions to each and every
158:28 - like user group and others
158:30 - so then we will use plus so now what we
158:33 - have to do I have to use x like I have
158:36 - to add executable permission to this
158:38 - file
158:40 - then file name then enter
158:43 - now again I will try to check the
158:45 - permission so here you can see in users
158:48 - also executables has been added in
158:50 - groups also executables has been at and
158:52 - in
158:54 - what we say in others also executables
158:57 - has been added so this is the most basic
159:00 - approach for adding permissions in some
159:03 - files or directories and here you can
159:05 - see the color has been also changed
159:08 - because it has now the executable
159:10 - permission that's why color has been
159:11 - changed from normal to
159:14 - green okay
159:17 - so uh what if you want to remove
159:19 - permissions okay so there is also way
159:23 - for it if I want to remove permissions
159:25 - like
159:27 - executable or okay so what I will do
159:30 - minus x minus y minus this because we
159:33 - use minus to remove the permissions now
159:37 - again you can give the file name that is
159:39 - private.txt again same thing I'll repeat
159:42 - LS iPhone L and here you can see
159:44 - executable permission has been removed
159:46 - from the user also group also and others
159:48 - also
159:49 - okay
159:51 - so this is the simple basic approach
159:53 - what if you want to remove
159:56 - like uh
159:58 - what we can say all the permissions
160:01 - so if I will do CH mode
160:04 - minus RW
160:07 - private.txt
160:11 - now here you can see all the permissions
160:13 - has been removed from this private.txt
160:16 - like a user has also no any permission
160:20 - or whether the
160:22 - groups has also not not any permission
160:25 - and others also have have got any
160:27 - permission
160:28 - so now what type will happen I will try
160:30 - to access this file
160:33 - so let's see what happens
160:36 - here you can see permission is denied
160:38 - why it's showing this error because the
160:42 - read permission like we have removed all
160:44 - the permission so simultaneously
160:46 - permission has also be removed okay so
160:49 - what I if I will add only the read
160:52 - permission okay what will happen now
160:58 - CH mode plus read
161:02 - then file name
161:05 - again I will do LSI funnel and here you
161:08 - will see the read permission has been
161:09 - added to all the groups now what I will
161:12 - do I will try to access this file
161:14 - private.txt
161:16 - and here you can see uh but here nothing
161:19 - is written that's why it's showing like
161:20 - nothing else has been printed but now
161:24 - you can see we can access this
161:26 - but here also you can see the right
161:28 - permission is not there so what if I
161:31 - will try to write some kind of files or
161:33 - some kind of thing or text in this file
161:35 - then let's see what happens whether we
161:37 - are able to write or not so here you can
161:39 - see permission denied why because you
161:42 - don't have right permission to change
161:45 - uh to change anything in this particular
161:48 - file
161:49 - okay
161:50 - so uh I hope you got it like how this uh
161:54 - like we can remove commissions we can
161:57 - add permissions then how we can do
161:59 - certain permissions together or add or
162:02 - remove okay like we did here like video
162:05 - we do two permissions
162:07 - together in this case hyphen RW okay
162:12 - so uh this approach is basically applies
162:15 - for if you want to apply certain
162:17 - permission for all the like offer all
162:21 - these three like for the users also for
162:24 - the groups also and for the
162:26 - this one others also what if you want to
162:30 - apply permissions to only user okay so
162:35 - how will you do it okay
162:38 - so in this case what will happen how you
162:41 - can do it
162:42 - like let me clear the screen
162:46 - LSI final okay now what I want to do I
162:49 - want to give the read sorry write
162:51 - permission to only the user okay
162:54 - so how I can do it CH mode
162:58 - then for user we use U and equal to is
163:03 - used to like assign certain only a
163:06 - specified permission to that particular
163:09 - user group or other okay now I will use
163:12 - here w
163:15 - and then
163:16 - private.txt
163:19 - and here you can see
163:22 - W has been added okay but uh
163:27 - uh yeah but read permission has been
163:31 - demo but uh so basically what happens
163:33 - here in this case when you provide this
163:36 - U equal to w
163:38 - so it only
163:40 - like what we can say it only uh like uh
163:44 - add that permission and whatever you
163:47 - have a default permission it will get
163:49 - removed okay so when we will use equal
163:52 - so it will just replace or you can say
163:54 - it will remove the other permission and
163:56 - it will add this new one okay
163:59 - so now what I have to do
164:03 - I will do uh like add read permission
164:06 - again in this
164:08 - user so how I can do it
164:11 - CH mode U Plus
164:15 - read okay private.txt
164:19 - so here you can see we have added read
164:21 - permission as well in this particular
164:24 - file
164:25 - what if you want to give like
164:30 - write permission to this one to others
164:33 - or two groups also for for groups so
164:36 - there is a notation of
164:38 - what we can say G
164:39 - okay
164:42 - and again unless I finally if you do hey
164:44 - you can see
164:45 - right permission has been added and for
164:48 - others we use
164:50 - o
164:54 - again unless iPhone L and here you can
164:57 - see the
164:58 - right permission has been added in this
165:00 - private Dot txt file okay
165:04 - so in this way uh you can add remove
165:06 - permission for users for groups or for
165:10 - others okay
165:12 - so this is basically for the like what
165:15 - we can say uh
165:17 - alphabetical notation okay but uh but
165:21 - numerical notation is I think it's good
165:25 - to use like it is easy also you can
165:28 - easily understand but if you're beginner
165:30 - you will think like yeah this is a easy
165:32 - so
165:33 - so now what I have to do
165:36 - I have I will remove all the permissions
165:39 - from this
165:41 - what we can say private.txt file
165:44 - so
165:46 - CH mode
165:51 - minus RW from all it will remove the
165:54 - from all the
165:57 - okay
166:00 - new permissions are W minus
166:07 - okay
166:09 - let me try to remove like this like a
166:12 - equal to
166:15 - or 0 0 I can give
166:20 - yeah
166:22 - so now here you can see all the
166:24 - permission has been removed why zero
166:26 - zero I will tell you uh in a little bit
166:29 - now
166:30 - so now what we have to do
166:33 - we will add permissions in this
166:36 - particular file using the octal notation
166:38 - of the
166:40 - like this octal notation of what we can
166:44 - say
166:45 - permission
166:46 - so let me like tell you those things
166:50 - again so that will be helpful for you so
166:53 - for octal notation what happens we use r
166:56 - equal to 4 okay
167:00 - and
167:02 - we use write
167:06 - to
167:08 - and execute equal to 1 okay so if you
167:12 - want to give the means all permissions
167:17 - okay like read write execute to
167:19 - particular user or particular group or
167:22 - particular
167:23 - other okay
167:25 - so what you will need to do you will
167:28 - need to give it as a seven like you want
167:31 - to give four also you want to give two
167:34 - also you want to give X also
167:37 - okay so overall it is seven so let me
167:41 - tell you with an example so that will be
167:42 - easy to understand okay so now what I
167:45 - will do CH mode
167:47 - 777
167:49 - this 7 is for first seven is for user
167:52 - second seven is for group and this third
167:55 - seven is for others so if I will do 777
167:58 - it will give all the permission to all
168:02 - those user group and
168:04 - others
168:05 - and now I will do this hyphen n and here
168:07 - you can see all the permission has been
168:09 - added to that particular private.txt
168:11 - file so now I will do some kind of
168:14 - changes I will again remove all the
168:16 - permission by
168:18 - applying 0 0 to all those
168:21 - okay
168:25 - so here I have removed all those
168:27 - permissions so now in this case what I
168:28 - have to do I have to only give the read
168:31 - permission okay uh let me open a text
168:34 - file for you uh or another terminal I
168:38 - will open
168:50 - so for R what we have for for write what
168:54 - we have to for execute what we have one
168:57 - so in this case what I want to give the
169:00 - user only I want to give them read and
169:03 - write okay
169:05 - so for user I will just write six okay
169:09 - and I want to give the group only write
169:12 - permission so two and I don't want any
169:14 - kind of permission to others so I will
169:16 - give it there as 0.
169:18 - okay and then find them
169:21 - so now here you can see we have only
169:24 - read write permission to this
169:26 - user only write permission to the group
169:29 - and there is no any permission to the
169:32 - what we can say or others okay
169:36 - so uh in this way I hope you got it like
169:39 - how you can change the permission based
169:42 - on this octane number I hope you got it
169:44 - like we have covered this in the last
169:45 - video okay so r equal to four to one
169:48 - that is seven if it is seven and it will
169:50 - give you the all the permissions you
169:53 - write execute together okay
169:55 - now what if you want to uh
169:59 - give permissions like uh
170:04 - what you can say
170:06 - suppose if you want to change permission
170:08 - uh
170:09 - from read write for user I will just
170:11 - give them as a
170:13 - one let's see what happens
170:18 - so here you can see
170:20 - only
170:21 - like what you can say
170:24 - others has been added execute okay not
170:27 - anyone else okay so this is a happening
170:31 - I think because of we have provided only
170:33 - one
170:34 - one means uh there is not a three values
170:38 - so now what we will do
170:42 - I will provide one to everyone
170:44 - let's see what happens
170:46 - you will see you have to only play with
170:48 - it when you will not play then you will
170:50 - not learn anything okay so that's all
170:53 - depends upon you so here you can see if
170:55 - I provided one to everyone so only
170:57 - execute permission has been added to all
170:59 - of them
171:00 - okay
171:02 - and if I provide two
171:05 - so
171:08 - let's see what happens
171:11 - only write permission has been added
171:14 - okay
171:15 - so I hope you got it uh let me provide
171:19 - uh like uh
171:22 - for user I will provide only execute
171:25 - for group I will provide
171:28 - an execute that is three another zero
171:32 - what happens
171:34 - same execute write execute and zero
171:38 - okay so I hope you got it like uh
171:43 - how you can do or change the permissions
171:46 - with the help of this octal numbers and
171:49 - all okay
171:50 - so uh that's all for today yeah One More
171:52 - Concept is remaining here like uh when I
171:55 - will release iPhone L here you will
171:57 - sometimes get the hyphen uh High not
172:00 - hyphen you will get instead of X you
172:02 - will get some kind sometime s so s is
172:05 - nothing but a set uid it basically means
172:07 - like when you provide a file uh like
172:11 - with that permission so what will happen
172:15 - it will run that particular file on
172:17 - behalf of you okay
172:20 - so uh let me uh check about the password
172:24 - uh
172:34 - one net in this iPhone and user
172:38 - bin
172:44 - okay so here you can see the S and here
172:47 - who is the user root is the user and
172:49 - also here is root is the user I hope you
172:52 - know about the root user like this is
172:54 - the main user if if you are not able to
172:57 - run any file you don't have any
172:58 - questions then you you can use the root
173:01 - user to run run those file so here what
173:04 - happens this is the password is one of
173:06 - the command to change the password of
173:08 - your PC okay or you this machine
173:12 - so basically what happens when we run
173:14 - this password command so we basically
173:16 - run this password command on behalf of
173:19 - whom on behalf of this root user that's
173:22 - why we have given it them as a s
173:24 - permission that is the set uid
173:25 - permission okay what will happen
173:27 - whenever you will run this password
173:29 - command okay
173:30 - so what happens
173:34 - it will like say you were changing a
173:37 - password for ayush okay so I don't have
173:39 - to change it right now
173:41 - so here what is happening this command
173:43 - is running on behalf of this
173:46 - root e so that's why we provided uh s
173:48 - permission so this is basically a
173:50 - special permission you can learn more
173:51 - about this on the Google okay
173:54 - so I don't have to change
173:57 - okay I will just
174:00 - close the terminal that's all
174:04 - so I have you got it like how you can do
174:06 - with the octal representation with the
174:08 - uh alphabetical notation so that's all
174:11 - for today we are going to cover the most
174:13 - important topic of how this next series
174:15 - that is the user creation okay
174:18 - so basically in this video we are going
174:19 - to cover the how you can create users
174:22 - what are the files affected by you by
174:24 - creating that particular user and how
174:27 - you can create what are the root users
174:29 - sudo command and we are going to cover
174:31 - many things in this particular video
174:32 - okay
174:33 - so before moving forward uh I just want
174:36 - to discuss about obesity a base a very
174:39 - basic thing that is what are the users
174:40 - okay I hope you you like
174:44 - you're aware of it like if you're using
174:46 - this pieces then you are the user if
174:48 - someone else is this using this
174:50 - particular PC and if he has or she has
174:53 - an account in the spirit and he see or
174:55 - he is the user
174:56 - so basically what are the user users are
174:58 - nothing but you can say uh a particular
175:00 - person a particular entity what he can
175:03 - just like change the files and
175:05 - directories or he can do whatever he
175:08 - want okay
175:10 - so moving forward in this video uh I
175:13 - will like start with the very basic
175:15 - thing like
175:17 - categories or types of users in our
175:20 - Linux system okay so I hope this
175:22 - terminal visible to you okay
175:24 - I will just write right now I'll just
175:27 - write things
175:28 - [Music]
175:29 - okay so the hash is basically just for
175:33 - comment okay so if whatever I will write
175:35 - it will like not execute as a command
175:38 - okay so there are two types of user in
175:41 - all this Linux operating system that is
175:43 - one is root user or you can say
175:44 - administrative user
175:46 - and other one is the normal user okay
175:50 - so what are the root users so if you are
175:53 - following the series then I don't think
175:55 - you are aware of the root user so but
175:57 - now we will cover it what is this
176:00 - so root user is basically that user who
176:02 - has access of the all the files and
176:04 - system like he he is just like
176:06 - administrator he can do anything he
176:08 - wants okay he has access of everything
176:11 - but what a normal user a normal user
176:13 - nothing but like who doesn't have all
176:15 - the access okay
176:17 - so uh if you take uh like real life
176:20 - example suppose you are a administrator
176:23 - of how this Windows PC or Linux PC
176:25 - anything
176:26 - okay
176:28 - and there is someone else who who has
176:31 - also access of this place but he is a
176:33 - normal user so I will just tell you like
176:37 - if you want to change the password of
176:39 - your of your account you can change it
176:41 - okay but if you want to change the
176:43 - password or anything uh files of that
176:47 - other user then you can access it but
176:49 - that user cannot access the file of this
176:53 - particular what which to use a root user
176:56 - or
176:57 - administrative or administrator okay so
177:01 - basically the difference between in this
177:03 - is like normal user can't access the
177:05 - files of administrative user button yes
177:08 - we can do it using the one of the
177:10 - functionality that is a sudo command
177:12 - okay I will tell you what are the sudo
177:14 - commands what is this how it works okay
177:18 - so this is all about the basics of
177:20 - difference between the root user and the
177:22 - normal user I hope you got it
177:24 - now moving forward uh now uh I will tell
177:28 - you about the sudo command what is this
177:30 - okay but before it I will try to like uh
177:34 - cover one thing also the root user I
177:37 - will first set up the root user then I
177:38 - will tell you about the sudo command one
177:40 - of the root users like I just described
177:42 - like he has access to all the permission
177:44 - but by default in this Ubuntu OS root
177:48 - user doesn't work because it is disabled
177:50 - okay
177:51 - so to enable it what you can do you can
177:54 - just simply change the password because
177:55 - you know the dot user is created you
177:57 - will just change the password
177:59 - okay
178:01 - so I will need sudo also because I don't
178:04 - I think it requires
178:06 - permission
178:08 - so the this pass WD is a command to
178:11 - change the user or to change the
178:13 - password of any user so I am changing
178:15 - the root
178:18 - okay here it is asking for
178:20 - my password and here I will try to
178:24 - add password of this root user okay
178:28 - so here we have successfully changed the
178:30 - password of this root user so now to
178:34 - login as a root user what you can do you
178:36 - can change the switch user okay
178:39 - AC root means
178:41 - Su stands for switch user and root is
178:44 - that's the username of that particular
178:45 - user and I will type the password
178:48 - and here you can see the hostname has
178:50 - been changed from IOS to the
178:52 - so I will do LS here so that I have all
178:55 - the files I can see here if I will go to
178:58 - go back I will do LS here you can say
179:00 - test user has been created by me okay
179:03 - so that's all about it like root user
179:07 - now uh what I will do is wait from this
179:10 - root user okay
179:13 - so we have created the root user and we
179:15 - have successfully set up the root user
179:17 - now moving forward the I was going to
179:19 - tell you about the sudo command what is
179:21 - this sudo Sudo what is the sudo command
179:23 - like there is a Boom episode like if
179:25 - anything doesn't work then you will just
179:27 - apply sudo and that thing will work okay
179:29 - so how it work basically that sudo
179:31 - command is nothing but uh like um
179:33 - you can say how should I explain let me
179:36 - explain it by you an example suppose uh
179:39 - you have a file okay file.txt
179:43 - you don't have access to it okay but if
179:46 - you want to access to it you can use the
179:47 - sudo command to access it okay I'm just
179:49 - giving you an example
179:51 - so
179:53 - how it works basically uh sudo command
179:56 - when you use it it like it will work on
180:00 - behalf of the which user
180:03 - the root user okay the root user because
180:07 - root user has access to all the files
180:11 - okay so what you will do you will try to
180:15 - access that file on behalf of root user
180:19 - okay I hope you got it okay so but now
180:23 - there is a question like then every user
180:26 - like suppose I am this ayush user I can
180:29 - access suppose I create some another
180:31 - user I used to then he can also access
180:33 - this particular administrative file but
180:36 - no the that's not a thing for this to
180:40 - work what you will need to do you will
180:41 - need to this I use 2 into a sudoers file
180:44 - that is some kind of file that is
180:45 - pseudos I think that that is the name I
180:48 - will Google it okay
180:50 - but remember I think this is the file
180:52 - sudo's file it is there okay so in this
180:55 - file that particular user should be
180:57 - added or should be present to run sudo
180:59 - command okay
181:01 - so you will see all these things after
181:04 - when you will create a user and all
181:06 - these things you will see it everything
181:07 - okay so don't worry about it
181:11 - so have you got it what is the sudo
181:13 - command and all these things now moving
181:15 - on to the main topic of our this video
181:17 - is the
181:19 - user creation okay
181:22 - so before starting uh there are some
181:25 - Concepts which you should learn okay so
181:27 - I have already written it on this notion
181:30 - okay
181:31 - so the concept which you should learn
181:33 - the first and basic thing is uid what is
181:37 - the uid UI did nothing but a user
181:40 - identification number you can say or
181:42 - user identifier
181:44 - so in Linux every user has their own
181:47 - unique ID
181:48 - okay so I will tell you my unique ID so
181:51 - if you will type ID and ayush
181:55 - here you can see my uid is 1000 and GID
181:58 - is 1000 this is the group ID and groups
182:01 - and all these things okay
182:04 - so now you have to focus only on this
182:06 - this part uid so now my uid is what
182:09 - 1000. okay if I want to change look at
182:13 - the root ID what are the what is the uid
182:16 - of the root
182:18 - so this is only 0 okay so that's thing I
182:21 - have written here like the ranges of uid
182:24 - is from 1 to 500
182:27 - only for
182:33 - so here for system users uid ranges from
182:36 - 1 to 500 and for the other users it
182:39 - starts from 1000 as in the Ubuntu and
182:41 - Fedora it just starts from 1000 1000 but
182:44 - 0 0 is reserved for which user root user
182:49 - or administrative user it is just the
182:51 - root is just the username okay
182:54 - so this is the concept of the uid okay
182:57 - so now what I will I'm going to tell you
183:00 - like uid I you got it the ID is 0 for
183:03 - the root user and 1000 for the ayush
183:06 - okay this is the ID which is generated
183:07 - for a whatever user you will create it
183:10 - will get added by one and one okay
183:15 - so now the next concept is uh the
183:19 - where the details of user is stored okay
183:23 - so there are some kind of files
183:25 - which are getting infected when you
183:27 - create a user the most uh like uh usual
183:31 - or you can say important file that is
183:34 - since it is a past WD is one of the file
183:37 - and other file is Slash the Etc
183:42 - shadow
183:44 - so essentially this is just a directory
183:46 - and it's just their location where it
183:48 - exists okay so the pass WD and Shadow
183:52 - file are the two file which get effect
183:53 - and also there are some other files so
183:57 - those we will not cover right now
183:59 - so these are the two files which getting
184:02 - affected okay
184:04 - so now if you will see the content of
184:06 - the slash ATC pass WT okay
184:10 - so what you will see
184:13 - wow I don't think you will understand
184:15 - anything right now okay let me clear the
184:18 - screen but before that let me tell you
184:20 - about this what is the password file or
184:22 - password files okay so in this file
184:25 - basically uh the
184:27 - information is stored about the user
184:30 - it means what information the uid
184:33 - okay the group ID
184:35 - their name okay
184:39 - and other information and also some
184:41 - other information like Linux login cell
184:44 - information are stored in this
184:45 - particular file okay so if I'll do cats
184:48 - CTC let me increase the
184:53 - okay
184:54 - so the first entry is of which user the
184:58 - first entry is of the root user okay
185:02 - and the second X is just for the
185:04 - password like here password doesn't like
185:07 - it
185:09 - doesn't display your password it is
185:12 - password is stored in another file that
185:13 - is a shadow file okay in the hash format
185:16 - type okay and then this is the group ID
185:19 - this uid group ID their group user group
185:23 - and their home directory and the shell
185:28 - which they are using Okay pin bash so
185:30 - there is the like
185:34 - I break every part of that particular
185:38 - like
185:40 - thing like there are seven what yeah
185:43 - seven separators or you can say seven
185:45 - Concepts you can say okay in this
185:49 - particular file so here you can see uh
185:51 - mark
185:52 - is what username X is what password 1001
185:58 - is what uid
186:00 - again one thousand one is what Zid
186:03 - again here is the additional information
186:05 - okay and this is the home directory
186:09 - and this is the login shell so what is
186:14 - the login cell but before understanding
186:16 - this you need to understand what is cell
186:18 - cell is nothing but which provides you
186:19 - an interface okay
186:22 - to work okay you can understand login
186:24 - cell is nothing but uh like whenever you
186:27 - login into the particular system then it
186:29 - starts working like you will learn about
186:32 - shell and Bash scripting or bash shell
186:34 - you will learn when we will start the
186:36 - best scripting concept okay
186:39 - so there are also some other sales you
186:41 - can see uh like gnu seashell console jet
186:46 - cell okay
186:48 - so now what uh
186:50 - I'm going to do I will create a one user
186:53 - okay but before that uh yeah One More
186:55 - Concept is remaining here like slash ATV
186:58 - Shadow okay now we will uh
187:01 - come back on this point later on after
187:03 - creating user
187:04 - and also your head you can see in my the
187:07 - first user that is ayush and 1000 is
187:10 - their uid GID and this is group
187:12 - additional info
187:14 - okay
187:15 - [Music]
187:17 - so now what I have to do
187:20 - clear the screen
187:22 - and I will going to add some users in
187:26 - this particular
187:29 - video or
187:32 - so I will use sudo command y sudo
187:34 - because user add command uh like does
187:37 - not work directly you can drive so if I
187:40 - have to user that it will give me the
187:42 - all the options but also if I will try
187:45 - to add user some kind of thing like some
187:48 - you can say which user
187:54 - test 22 so here you can see permission
187:57 - denied by permission denied because you
188:00 - don't have access to run this user add
188:02 - command because only root can add users
188:04 - so now what we will do we are going to
188:06 - add user on behalf of the root account
188:07 - okay that's why we will use sudo now now
188:11 - I think you got the main concept of this
188:13 - sudo
188:15 - sudo user ad I will write some good name
188:19 - let's take Mike
188:22 - oh no with that stick with that okay
188:25 - and uh sudo user ad VDOT just uh this is
188:31 - the username now I will hit enter
188:33 - user has been created now to look at the
188:36 - file where the user has been created or
188:38 - not what I will do
188:42 - I will open up another terminal
188:44 - [Music]
188:47 - okay and I will just read the password
188:50 - file
188:52 - and here you can see Virat user has been
188:55 - created and we still have not saved the
188:58 - password okay and the uid has been given
189:01 - to that particular user 1002 and another
189:04 - group ID has been given to 1002 and this
189:08 - is the home way that has been created
189:10 - but using user add command it does not
189:13 - reflect let's check whether it reflects
189:15 - or not
189:17 - if I do LS here you can see without
189:19 - directory has not been created I will
189:21 - tell you everything how you can do it
189:23 - using user add command okay and the
189:25 - shell which are being used by this is
189:28 - bin sh okay
189:30 - so uh like in this way you can simply
189:33 - like
189:36 - add a user you know in your system now
189:39 - to change the password or assign the
189:41 - password what you will need to do
189:47 - password command you will use sudo
189:49 - password we're not
189:52 - password let's write same without Virat
189:56 - okay password data successfully now the
190:00 - other file which come enroll in this
190:03 - user creation process that is Shadow
190:05 - file in Shadow file what happens like um
190:10 - all the passwords are stored in the hash
190:12 - format okay
190:14 - now let's take a look at the shadow file
190:21 - so as you can see permission denied so
190:23 - what I can do I will just use sudo
190:25 - because now I will run this command as
190:26 - on behalf of the root user now it will
190:30 - ask you for the password just enter and
190:32 - here you can see Virat
190:34 - okay
190:38 - so Virat is there and this is the hash
190:41 - format of your password
190:43 - okay
190:45 - and uh next here is the
190:49 - when password created or passwords in
190:51 - expiry right not all things now let me
190:53 - open up this to simplify this
190:56 - uh yeah here you can see Mark dollar six
191:00 - dollar
191:01 - this is the whole day like hash format
191:05 - encrypted password you can say and this
191:07 - is the when last password was changed
191:10 - then again their minimum password h
191:14 - and then maximum password H again
191:18 - warning period in activity expiration
191:20 - unused all these things is like in this
191:23 - Shadow file you can get but we have not
191:26 - assigned any kind of deals thing in like
191:27 - expiry rate all these things so that's
191:29 - why we are not able to see it so there
191:32 - are some encrypted password you can say
191:34 - what are the format like dollar type
191:36 - dollar short dollar hash is the format
191:39 - to a store your password
191:40 - so if it is 1 then it is md5 it is two
191:43 - way it is Blowfish this is uh 2y
191:46 - e case Blowfish you can say all this
191:49 - thing if dollar five and second is such
191:51 - a 256 and 512 now for dollar y it is the
191:54 - yes script so it is also one of the
191:56 - method you can learn about it
191:59 - and now uh if you will learn about the
192:02 - last password change on in this what
192:04 - happens it calculates from this state
192:07 - Jan 1 to 1970.
192:10 - okay and for expiry like it also like
192:14 - calculate from that particular day
192:18 - so I hope you got it the like what are
192:21 - the password file what are the shadow
192:23 - file if you want to take a screenshot
192:25 - you can take off this particular content
192:28 - so it will be helpful to understand you
192:31 - okay
192:33 - and for password you can
192:36 - just like you can take the screenshot of
192:38 - this particular part
192:41 - okay so now uh
192:45 - what we have to do we have successfully
192:47 - created this particular
192:50 - user now what we will do we are going to
192:53 - login
192:54 - okay we are going to login using that
192:57 - particular username and password so you
193:00 - can do SEO
193:03 - and uh
193:06 - username Virat and the password which
193:08 - you have set me that and here we you are
193:11 - in this
193:12 - particular user
193:15 - shell
193:17 - so here you can see who am I that is
193:19 - without if I'll do LS so you don't have
193:21 - permission
193:22 - because user simply just at the user
193:25 - adds a user so you will need to perform
193:28 - some other actions also okay
193:32 - so I will exit to from this cell
193:38 - [Music]
193:42 - okay let me clear the screen here also
193:46 - and now what I'm going to do I will just
193:51 - like use the other options which you can
193:54 - use with the user add command okay like
193:57 - there are multiple options which you can
193:58 - use okay
194:00 - so
194:02 - to create a home directory which option
194:04 - we use we use hyphen M option okay
194:09 - and to create a
194:11 - [Music]
194:13 - like user with your own user ID then we
194:17 - use
194:18 - hyphen U option
194:20 - okay
194:22 - and to add some command comments we use
194:25 - hyphen C option
194:27 - okay
194:30 - uh wait a minute hyphen C option
194:35 - so that's all
194:36 - and hyphen s option is also used to
194:39 - assign the login shell okay
194:42 - so uh we can use this one by one or in a
194:46 - single command also
194:48 - okay
194:49 - so uh for your Simplicity or will you
194:53 - like to make it simple I will use first
194:56 - one by one then I will like
195:01 - and everything in a single command
195:06 - now here I will I I'm creating hyphen
195:09 - name without two okay
195:12 - so permission denied so I forgot to use
195:14 - sudo I will use sudo and again you will

200:18 - congratulations you have successfully
200:20 - created
200:22 - one user and you have like you have all
200:25 - you have set the password of it you have
200:28 - created the home directory for it
200:29 - everything okay done
200:32 - so now what you can do
200:35 - [Music]
200:35 - um
200:39 - uh what you can do now
200:41 - yeah
200:43 - so uh you can see the multiple process
200:46 - we did in this like first we created
200:49 - user using user ad
200:52 - then we provided using hyphen apps
200:54 - option to create home directory then for
200:57 - the shell we use iPhone S option for
201:00 - command we use iPhone 3 option
201:03 - and for and what else we used for uid
201:07 - you used hyphen U option okay
201:11 - so these are the multiple options you
201:13 - are using the user add command so
201:15 - basically user add command is the low
201:17 - level utility which means like it is
201:19 - earlier used but now it's there is also
201:22 - other utility that is add user there is
201:24 - a high level utility you can see
201:27 - okay so this is also useful because
201:29 - sometimes in kind of automation thing
201:32 - you need it okay
201:34 - oh I do yeah but you should know this
201:38 - method also so now moving forward what I
201:41 - am going to do
201:42 - I'm just let me like list all the
201:50 - so we are two three four has been
201:52 - getting 15.1 okay
201:55 - so now what I'm going to do I'm going to
201:57 - add a user using the simple command that
202:01 - is uh
202:02 - add user command okay
202:04 - so how you can do it sudo
202:07 - add user
202:09 - and the username which you want to give
202:11 - I just want to give as a search in
202:15 - okay
202:17 - what it is showing me please enter a
202:20 - username matching the regular expression
202:22 - configured
202:26 - here's the iPhone 4S okay
202:28 - I think I'll need to write as a small
202:30 - case in
202:32 - yes
202:34 - so here you can see you can't use
202:35 - capital letter okay
202:37 - so here you can see adding users
202:39 - searching adding a new group such in
202:41 - here group is also added I didn't talk
202:44 - about group in this video I will talk
202:45 - about in the later video okay
202:48 - and then you have to here only you have
202:50 - to enter the password like uh
202:55 - and again you have to enter the password
202:58 - and here if you want to give full name
203:00 - you can give
203:03 - a chintendo
203:06 - room number one two three work phone
203:10 - seven eight nine four five six one two
203:12 - three yeah oh sorry sorry
203:16 - one two three four five six seven eight
203:19 - nine zero home number zero nine eight
203:21 - seven six five four three two one
203:23 - other two nine years if you if you
203:26 - didn't enter anything it will be blank
203:28 - okay other is the information correct
203:31 - yes obviously why
203:33 - so now
203:34 - user hasn't created
203:36 - so
203:38 - this is a very simple command like in
203:40 - just one command you can create uh you
203:43 - can set the password you can add if any
203:45 - extra information you want to add
203:47 - okay so using this command you can
203:50 - simply do those things okay
203:53 - so if I will check the
203:55 - content or password so here you can see
203:57 - Sachin
203:58 - 1004 has been idea assigned to Sachin
204:02 - full name
204:04 - their phone number whatever it is room
204:06 - number home number and the directory
204:09 - directory has been also created let's
204:11 - check
204:13 - LS so here you can see Sachin and now
204:16 - let's login using searchin
204:21 - now you are here and
204:26 - if you will do LS so there is nothing
204:29 - any file so in this way also you can add
204:31 - users okay so that's all for today's
204:35 - video guys I hope you liked it and if
204:38 - you have yeah if you have any queries
204:39 - then please you can ask us in the
204:41 - comment section okay so that's all for
204:43 - today and we will meet in the next video
204:45 - with another concept so that's all so
204:48 - thank you thank you guys for watching
204:49 - this video and we'll meet in the next
204:51 - one thank you
204:52 - in this video we are going to talk about
204:54 - groups okay what are the groups in Linux
204:57 - operating system
204:58 - so basically as the name suggests you
205:01 - can think like a group as a like a group
205:03 - of some kind of users group or
205:05 - politicians group of actors and this is
205:07 - the name suggest but any in Linux we can
205:10 - create different kind of groups like we
205:13 - can create separate groups for developer
205:14 - for pen tip from for pen test or the
205:17 - different groups and for marketing team
205:19 - different groups so basically this is
205:22 - the basically mostly use of groups like
205:24 - we can create different groups for
205:25 - different teams and we we can provide
205:27 - them the like different permissions
205:30 - according to their role
205:32 - so there is a basic simple command Linux
205:35 - like group AD okay using this command we
205:37 - can basically uh create groups in our
205:40 - operating system and I hope this is
205:43 - available to you let me increase the
205:44 - size first
205:46 - right it's too large let me hit this
205:48 - yeah now it's fine
205:50 - so how you can do it uh the one command
205:52 - which I told you right now it's group
205:54 - add and what you have to do you have to
205:57 - just provide the name of the group which
205:58 - you want
206:00 - so uh
206:03 - I will name it as a
206:07 - like Developers
206:10 - okay so here you can see it is showing
206:13 - permission denied so one thing here also
206:15 - is like uh the group group AD command is
206:18 - or can be or only performed by those
206:21 - users whether they are root or whether
206:24 - they have a certain permission of root
206:27 - permission or you can say whether they
206:28 - are in the pseudos file okay so in that
206:32 - file if any user in that particular file
206:34 - so they can easily use this particular
206:37 - uh feature of sudo command okay
206:40 - so I'm in that file like this user and
206:44 - yeah you show what I will do I will just
206:45 - add sudo
206:47 - and it will ask me
206:49 - to enter the password done and we are
206:52 - done here you are not uh getting any
206:55 - kind of output or something but let me
206:58 - tell you one thing like when you create
207:00 - this uh or when you add
207:03 - this group had a command or you add
207:06 - different groups so at that time what
207:08 - happened there are the two files which
207:10 - gets affected when you hit this
207:12 - particular command one is
207:17 - uh one is group which are located in the
207:20 - slash CTC
207:22 - directory and the one another is
207:26 - slash Etc G shadow
207:30 - okay
207:31 - so I will show you the con content of
207:36 - group file okay like in Shadow file it
207:39 - basically contains the like when you
207:42 - create a group with password and like
207:44 - they are not much required because like
207:47 - if there are multiple users then like
207:50 - your password will get uh like
207:52 - compromise you can think about of it
207:55 - okay
207:56 - so uh these are the two file which get
207:58 - affected when you whenever you create a
208:00 - group okay so let me show you the
208:03 - content of first CAD slash Etc
208:05 - like group file
208:08 - and here you can see there are the
208:10 - multiple groups here okay there are
208:13 - multiple groups the first group it may
208:15 - be root okay this is the root and these
208:18 - are some system users and here in the
208:20 - last video we had covered our Vita two
208:22 - three four so whenever you add a new
208:24 - user then the separate groups is also
208:26 - created okay so right now what we have
208:29 - added we have added developers okay so
208:32 - developers is one of the group and X is
208:35 - for password and this is the group ID
208:37 - okay so let me show you the detailed
208:40 - information about this particular file
208:42 - so that will be
208:44 - more clear for you guys okay so in this
208:47 - picture you can see like CD-ROM x 24 and
208:52 - this will be a question these are the
208:53 - users
208:55 - but in our case users are not visible
208:57 - why because we have not still added
209:00 - users in our group so we will do this in
209:03 - our next video okay
209:05 - so in this particular video we will only
209:06 - create groups like we will say different
209:08 - options how you can do it and here you
209:11 - can see the like detailed information
209:13 - about that particular file so here you
209:16 - can see those CD term is what just the
209:18 - name of your group like here you can see
209:19 - one indicates the group name like it is
209:22 - the name of the group if you run LS and
209:24 - this command you will see okay
209:26 - and then this is for password which we
209:28 - have not provided this is the GID that
209:30 - is a group ID and the group list like
209:33 - who are the users present in this
209:35 - particular
209:36 - group
209:38 - I hope that is clear to you okay
209:40 - so now what I will do uh I will try to
209:43 - create a group with some
209:46 - another GID okay
209:49 - so for this we can use the only one
209:52 - option is there that is hyphen G option
209:54 - which will help you to create
209:56 - uh like um
209:58 - group with different GID
210:01 - okay so but before that I want to I
210:04 - wanna show you one more option that is
210:06 - hyphen f option what it does
210:08 - sorry basically
210:12 - when you want to create a group with the
210:16 - same name then let's see what happens
210:17 - okay so I'm going to enter the same
210:20 - command again let's see what happens
210:22 - here you can see group developer already
210:25 - exist but what if you want to like if
210:28 - you don't want to see this error message
210:30 - or you want to forcefully create that
210:32 - particular like developer group so in
210:35 - this case you can use which option you
210:37 - can use just
210:39 - hyphen f option hyphenator stands out
210:41 - forcefully okay or you can say Force
210:44 - so in this case what will happen I will
210:46 - hit enter and here again you can see
210:49 - same developer 1502
210:53 - okay so now in this key now what I will
210:56 - do wait a minute
210:59 - why my screen is not
211:05 - okay
211:13 - okay so now what I will do I will try to
211:17 - create a group with some different GID
211:19 - okay so how you can do it uh for this we
211:22 - have a hyphen G option
211:24 - group AD and still I will use hyphen egg
211:27 - option because I don't want to create
211:28 - some other groups I would just want to
211:30 - work on this particular developers group
211:32 - hyphen app then I will use hyphen G and
211:36 - I will provide this 2000
211:38 - let's provide it 2022 and the name is
211:41 - Still Remains same that is developers
211:43 - and I have not added photo
211:45 - it's more important with the help of
211:48 - sudo you can perform anything in Linux
211:51 - just hit enter and then again we will
211:53 - see the content
211:56 - and here you can see okay it our GRE
212:01 - not added here
212:03 - okay let me check
212:05 - now we have entered collect command or
212:07 - not
212:09 - oh yeah there is a hyphen G option is
212:11 - correct
212:14 - okay
212:16 - let's try to
212:19 - create different group
212:22 - testers
212:27 - okay so what happened like when we we
212:32 - were using hyphen option then in that
212:34 - case we cannot change this GID
212:37 - but with other when you will create new
212:40 - group then you can uh change it like
212:44 - this tid like you can create your
212:47 - uh you you can create like a group with
212:50 - your own jid okay
212:52 - so like in this way you like you learn
212:54 - something new like you can't do like
212:56 - that if someone asks you to perform the
212:58 - same thing then you can use this and why
213:00 - it is not possible to change this GID
213:04 - using iPhone option
213:07 - so uh now what we I will do uh there is
213:09 - also one command that we can use like uh
213:12 - like for getting the list of users what
213:14 - I'm typing I am typing this cash slash
213:17 - Etc group okay but instead instead of
213:20 - this we can use the one command that is
213:23 - g
213:24 - ENT
213:26 - and
213:29 - then group
213:35 - and here you will get get the list of
213:38 - all the groups which is present in our
213:40 - system
213:41 - okay and to delete the groups you can
213:44 - easily uh delete it using the group Dell
213:46 - command that is very simple that is what
213:48 - I will group tell
213:50 - and I will just pass the name of the
213:53 - group which you want to date I want to
213:54 - delete testers
213:56 - and hit enter again permission United
213:58 - why because I am not your sudo let's use
214:01 - sudo
214:02 - and then again get list of that
214:06 - get list where it is
214:10 - okay so here you can see tester has been
214:12 - removed
214:13 - so I hope you guys like learned about
214:15 - how we can add groups in our Linux
214:18 - system and but in our further video we
214:20 - will see like how we can add users in
214:22 - particular different groups like there
214:25 - is also a separate command for this task
214:27 - that is a user mod or you can say user
214:29 - modification also like there are many uh
214:32 - properties of this particular command we
214:34 - will learn all about this in the next
214:36 - video okay
214:37 - so that's all for it and we'll meet in
214:39 - the next video so thank you thank you
214:41 - for watching and we'll meet you next one
214:43 - thank you
214:45 - this video we are going to cover the one
214:47 - command that is the user mod like as the
214:49 - name suggest it is the user modification
214:51 - command like with the help of this
214:53 - command you can modify the user details
214:56 - like their user ID you can modify their
214:58 - username you can modify or if you want
215:00 - to add those users into that particular
215:03 - group then you can also do it in this
215:05 - particular video so basically mainly we
215:07 - will focus like adding users into groups
215:10 - in this particular video in our next
215:11 - video we will try to cover the like
215:13 - extra things or whatever is the like
215:16 - user locking changing uid changing their
215:19 - uh what you can say uh their group name
215:22 - all these things we will cover in our
215:24 - next video
215:25 - so here is the scenario for you guys
215:27 - like uh there is a some kind of company
215:30 - and here you can see different teams are
215:33 - there like developer tester marketing
215:35 - team okay these are some kind of teams
215:37 - in that particular company and we have a
215:39 - different users like D1 D2 T1 T2 M1 M2
215:44 - so basically suppose this is our uh some
215:47 - kind of Linux server and in which we
215:49 - want to create different groups so there
215:52 - will be separate groups for developer
215:53 - separate groups for tester and similarly
215:55 - for marketing game there will be a
215:57 - separate group and these are the users
215:59 - so now what we will do we will try to
216:01 - first of all create all these user all
216:03 - these groups then we will create users
216:06 - and then we will add these users into
216:08 - that
216:09 - groups using user mode command okay
216:14 - so now first what we will check if we
216:17 - have
216:20 - that group present or not
216:25 - I have
216:27 - sorry
216:32 - okay so here you can see uh there is no
216:35 - any other groups present like developers
216:37 - marketing team and all other groups okay
216:40 - so now what we can do we can try to add
216:42 - those groups so how we can do it you can
216:45 - do it easily by using group add command
216:49 - and I will try to give the uid that is
216:53 - 2001
216:55 - and the name of the group that will be
216:57 - Developers
217:00 - okay so it is showing permission denied
217:02 - why because we have not added sudo here
217:04 - because it runs only if you have a
217:07 - permission
217:08 - like that user should be adding that
217:11 - suitors file
217:12 - so now I will need to enter my password
217:16 - and again let's check if this group is
217:18 - added or not
217:20 - so here you can see developers group has
217:22 - been added okay
217:23 - and 2001 is the GID and we have not
217:26 - still added any kind of user into this
217:28 - group
217:29 - okay
217:30 - so now let's uh
217:33 - create other groups
217:37 - um
217:42 - testers I will try to give you editors
217:45 - 2002.
217:46 - again permission denied
217:50 - okay added
217:52 - and now marketing
217:56 - team
217:57 - okay
217:59 - 2012 already just change the uid to
218:02 - three
218:03 - okay
218:06 - so now what we can do we can check if
218:08 - all the groups has been created or not
218:09 - so here you can see developers tester
218:12 - marketing team has been created now what
218:14 - we have to do we have to create all
218:16 - these users like D1 D2 D1 T2 M1 M2 okay
218:21 - but before creating group there is a one
218:23 - concept of primary and secondary group
218:25 - in all this Linux system so you will
218:28 - need to understand it first like
218:29 - basically what is primary group in
218:31 - primary group what happens when you
218:33 - create a one user or any new user so
218:36 - simultaneously a one group is also
218:38 - created with them like suppose I have
218:40 - created test okay a test user then test
218:43 - group will be also created okay so that
218:46 - is a primary group and what is a
218:47 - secondary group
218:48 - second group is nothing but uh like uh
218:51 - one user like will present in other
218:54 - groups also
218:55 - suppose this is a D1 user and he has a
218:59 - primary group of D1 and but he is also
219:02 - present in developer so developer is
219:04 - it's what secondary group okay
219:07 - have you gotten the concept of this okay
219:12 - so now what we can do I will add users
219:15 - so for users also we use sudo command
219:18 - and we will use add user command
219:20 - not user ad
219:23 - um
219:24 - name it as a D1
219:29 - matching the regular expression okay so
219:32 - I think we cannot write the numerical
219:35 - uh Devo
219:38 - one
219:41 - okay should add user day one is
219:43 - knowledge
219:45 - okay let me check
219:55 - Okay add user
220:02 - that is sudo again I will try to create
220:05 - user
220:12 - oh sorry
220:18 - add user developer
220:20 - [Music]
220:22 - one
220:24 - okay so here you can see like developer
220:27 - one has been like username has been
220:29 - created now it is asking me to enter the
220:31 - password of that particular user so I
220:34 - will enter some kind like
220:37 - anything maybe which I want
220:40 - and full name
220:42 - um I don't want to give
220:45 - and whether this information correct or
220:46 - not yes it is correct
220:48 - so this user has been created like to
220:51 - verify whether user has been created or
220:53 - not what you can do like as we have
220:55 - earlier learned like when whenever we
220:57 - create a user then the information is
220:59 - get stored or get added into the
221:01 - password to file that is pass WD okay so
221:05 - we will check the content of that file
221:08 - sorry
221:11 - so here you can see our developer one
221:13 - has been created with the uid disk and
221:15 - 1001. GID what is Zid that is the group
221:19 - ID and this is uh his primary group okay
221:24 - so if you will check with the ID command
221:25 - of that particular user they were
221:28 - developer one
221:30 - so here you can see their GID is 1001
221:32 - and their primary group is developer one
221:34 - okay and groups in which groups this
221:37 - user is present so basically it is
221:39 - present in only one group that is a
221:40 - developer one because we have not added
221:43 - this user into the developers group
221:45 - so now what I will do again I will
221:47 - create another user
221:49 - um developer to
221:54 - okay let's enter password
221:59 - I don't want to provide yes
222:02 - done again
222:06 - now I will create for tester tester one
222:10 - same
222:13 - sorry
222:21 - y okay tester has been added now tested
222:25 - to
222:30 - no full name nothing required yes okay
222:34 - we have already covered this user
222:36 - creation you can watch our previous
222:37 - video okay so uh these two users has
222:40 - been added let's again check the content
222:42 - of that password file so here you can
222:45 - see developer one developer 2 tester one
222:47 - tester 2 has been added again last one
222:49 - is remaining that is virtual marketing
222:51 - team
222:52 - Okay so
222:55 - uh where that last command which we have
222:58 - done okay
223:01 - I will just write mt1
223:04 - password
223:05 - okay
223:09 - nothing is required yes
223:11 - again mt2
223:14 - password uh enter anything which you
223:17 - want
223:22 - nothing required nothing and then yes
223:25 - okay so successfully we have created all
223:28 - these three users and the groups okay so
223:30 - as per this scenario like developer has
223:32 - developer one developer two tester one
223:35 - tester two marketing team one and
223:37 - marketing team too okay
223:40 - so now we will check whether all these
223:42 - things have been created or not for your
223:44 - like clarification
223:48 - cat slash CTC
223:52 - so here you can see all these six users
223:54 - has been created so now the main thing
223:56 - uh the main topic of our this video is
223:59 - user mode like user modification so now
224:02 - let's check the uh first of all check
224:04 - the like group of developer uh not
224:07 - developer let's check for tester one
224:10 - so here you can see GID is this and
224:12 - group is this is added only in this
224:14 - group particular and now let's check the
224:17 - like whatever the groups we have present
224:24 - so here you can see uh
224:28 - here one developers testers marketing
224:31 - team and also you can see developer one
224:34 - developer to this this and why why this
224:37 - is happening because these are the
224:38 - primary groups for that particular user
224:40 - like when you have created that
224:42 - developer one user then simultaneously
224:44 - another group has been also created okay
224:46 - that's why this is a primary group now
224:49 - what we will do we will add this
224:50 - developer one user into this developers
224:52 - group and then we will check that uh
224:54 - like check with the ID command like
224:58 - um what are the other groups in which
224:59 - that particular user is present okay so
225:02 - now the role of user mode begins so
225:04 - let's start with this so basically uh
225:07 - user mode we will use it uh like this
225:10 - like user mode and then we will provide
225:12 - the name of the group in which we want
225:15 - an iPhone a option hyphen a is nothing
225:18 - for the append option okay I hope you
225:20 - are aware of append like appending
225:22 - something like uh
225:24 - Suppose there is a some kind of content
225:27 - and you are just appending into
225:29 - something things in it okay you can
225:31 - think of it like that and we will use
225:34 - hyphen G option for the groups
225:38 - and the group name so what we want that
225:41 - is the Developers
225:42 - I think this is the same name if I am
225:45 - correct let me check it
225:58 - okay leave
226:01 - I'm correct I know
226:03 - uh
226:05 - developer one
226:08 - permission denied again because we have
226:10 - not used sudo here
226:14 - and now let's check the
226:17 - groups of this particular user developer
226:19 - one
226:20 - so here you can see like uh GID is 1001
226:25 - and the groups which in which groups
226:26 - this particular user is present so here
226:28 - you can see developer one this is his
226:31 - primary group and developers is it
226:33 - secondary group okay
226:36 - so again let's add other users also like
226:40 - uh
226:42 - developer to
226:44 - I will add this user into this
226:47 - developers
226:48 - what you can say developers group
226:51 - added simultaneously we will add
226:54 - users and testers group
227:01 - uh
227:03 - after one
227:11 - return wrong name
227:19 - tester one okay
227:25 - added again for tester 2.
227:29 - added similarly for marketing team
227:32 - uh let me check the name of that
227:37 - particular group
227:43 - um
227:44 - marketing team okay
227:46 - and here you can see like in developers
227:48 - we have you can see like developer one
227:50 - has been added and developer 2 has been
227:52 - added similarly in testers we have
227:54 - tested one and tester two okay
227:57 - so now what we will do
228:02 - we will add
228:03 - users into the marketing team
228:07 - let me clear the screen and marketing
228:10 - team and
228:12 - a username was mt1 I think mt1 okay
228:17 - added and similarly empty
228:19 - [Music]
228:20 - empty two it was I think
228:24 - let me check the name of that particular
228:26 - user
228:30 - foreign
228:43 - so now again we will check
228:51 - so now here you can see the developers
228:53 - group like what are the users present
228:55 - that is developer one and developer two
228:57 - in similarly interested groups we have a

232:45 - first some kind of comments in that
232:47 - particular user so how you can do it
232:50 - user mode hyphen C

232:58 - okay to provide some comments so let me
233:00 - provide like uh I am a hacker
233:04 - okay and the name of that the particular
233:07 - user hackerman and I will use sudo like
233:09 - because we can't use normally this
233:11 - command
233:13 - okay so now let's check the sorry not I
233:17 - don't want to switch I need this one
233:19 - yeah so here you can see the comment has
233:22 - been added like I am a hacker so in this
233:24 - way if you want to like

233:37 - developer this is second developer or
233:39 - his ID is this his ID this okay and kind
233:42 - of this kind of things you can do
233:44 - okay so now moving forward what we can
233:46 - do uh we can also change the uid what is
233:49 - uid UI is just the unique identifier
233:51 - number uh which you can change of any
233:53 - particular user which you want
233:55 - so how you can do it simple
233:57 - just provide a
234:01 - hyphen which option new Option and then
234:03 - uid which you want so right now what it
234:05 - is one double zero eight I will
234:08 - give it as two double zero it let's hit
234:11 - enter and again uh let's check this
234:13 - content of that particular file and it
234:15 - should be change yeah so here you can
234:18 - see 2008 this is the uid and what is
234:21 - this one double zero this is the GID
234:22 - okay but we have what changed we have
234:24 - changed the
234:25 - uid okay so uh we have covered now
234:29 - iPhone c hyphen U now moving forward and
234:31 - uh if you want to change the username of
234:35 - this particular hacker man like from a
234:37 - hackerman to if you want to change it
234:40 - like um
234:41 - best hacker like this like this kind of
234:44 - thing if you want to so how you can do
234:47 - it uh I will use again the C sudo user
234:50 - mod okay and I will use hyphen L option
234:54 - for changing the username
234:56 - iPhone L and the new username which you
235:00 - want I want sorry
235:04 - uh I want uh best hacker
235:09 - okay
235:10 - I will hit enter and again
235:15 - check here so here you can see the name
235:18 - from hackerman to best hacker like it
235:21 - has been changed so in this way you can
235:24 - also change the like username of your uh
235:28 - okay
235:29 - you can change the username of your
235:31 - particular user if you want okay
235:33 - and also you the most like important
235:35 - thing is here you can use hyphen e
235:37 - option also okay
235:39 - uh hyphony option what it will provide
235:42 - it will just add the like expired date
235:44 - like when that user should be get
235:46 - disabled so you can do it using the just
235:49 - one option that is a user mode hyphen e
235:52 - e stands for expiry and the particular
235:54 - date on which you want okay
235:58 - so today is uh 28 I will provide it as a
236:03 - 30 okay 30
236:06 - now not in this I think year month and
236:09 - then 2022
236:11 - and then month that is
236:13 - it
236:15 - and 30 okay
236:18 - I will hit enter and the high command
236:21 - doesn't exist yeah because we have
236:22 - changed the name from hackerman to which
236:25 - best hacker
236:27 - best hacker
236:30 - done let's check whether it is
236:32 - reflecting or not it should
236:34 - okay but here it is not reflecting it
236:37 - reflects and writing Shadow file okay
236:40 - so uh in this way you can also add the
236:43 - expiry date and one more like important
236:46 - command is that locking and unlocking of
236:48 - user account now you can do it in this
236:50 - so for this option we use the capital L
236:53 - option okay to lock a user so in this
236:56 - what happens like uh the that user can't
236:59 - log in using the username and password
237:01 - like but other methods are required like
237:03 - key based or switching user like which
237:04 - we did here earlier okay
237:08 - so to log the user what we can do user
237:10 - mode iPhone l
237:12 - uh capital and the best hacker
237:16 - permission denied why we have not used
237:19 - sudo hit enter we have logged the user
237:21 - if I will try to not right now first of
237:25 - all I have to delete some users
237:27 - like I'm Linux marketing these all the
237:30 - users I want to delete uh how you can do
237:33 - it sudo user Dell
237:36 - uh I am Linux
237:39 - marketing
237:41 - [Music]
237:42 - maybe a simultaneously if I
237:45 - um I don't know I can do or not
237:48 - mt1
237:51 - tester two
237:55 - tester one
237:58 - develop one
238:02 - developer 2.
238:08 - okay but I don't think I'm
238:13 - succeed or not I don't think
238:17 - okay so now I am not like able to like
238:21 - delete that users like simultaneously
238:23 - okay so I will need to do one by one let
238:26 - me do it
238:28 - first because I have to show you like I
238:30 - am not able to log in using the username
238:32 - and password okay
238:34 - so the user Dell developer one
238:39 - again develop it
238:42 - developer to
238:44 - again tester one
238:51 - extra two
238:54 - marketing
238:57 - what is the name of the user that mt1
239:02 - done again it is marketing something
239:04 - marketing to done I am Linux
239:09 - I am Linux done okay so we have deleted
239:13 - all the users like XI users which we had
239:15 - created earlier
239:17 - okay
239:20 - so now let me check the again that file
239:22 - okay so here you can see on the best
239:24 - hacker is there so now what I will do I
239:26 - will try to like uh
239:30 - switch user from here
239:32 - okay
239:36 - uh
239:39 - wait a minute it's like
239:41 - yeah
239:43 - not listed it's not showing yeah and it
239:46 - is not showing okay
239:48 - so when we will unlock then we will try
239:51 - to check whether it is uh like visible
239:53 - or not that option of particular that
239:56 - user okay
239:57 - so I think if we have logged it that's
240:00 - why it's not visible to us okay
240:03 - so uh now to unlock the particular user
240:06 - what you can do you can you have to just
240:07 - use hyphen you option okay but before
240:10 - that I will show you this one like if
240:13 - you are able to switch or not
240:20 - uh
240:21 - I don't think we are
240:28 - authentication failure okay
240:37 - okay authentication failure will be
240:39 - there yeah I'm correct so now what if we
240:42 - have blocked the user now what we can do
240:43 - we will provide this hyphenue option it
240:46 - will unlock the user okay so again let's
240:49 - check whether we are able to log in or
240:52 - not so now now we are able to login so
240:55 - when you log the user you can't just
240:58 - um login or anything for like using
241:00 - username and password okay so here also
241:03 - if we try to check whether the name of
241:06 - that particular user is available or not
241:09 - switch user
241:14 - just wait for a minute like it takes
241:16 - some time
241:18 - so here you can see I am a hacker white
241:20 - song because we have added that comment
241:21 - okay
241:22 - so where it is showing okay but I am
241:25 - still logging into my account
241:28 - oh I have added wrong
241:35 - okay
241:36 - so uh that's all for this video guys I
241:39 - hope you learned about like how you can
241:41 - uh edit the username add comments uh
241:44 - like editing username like mostly we
241:46 - want to edit okay and uh most and we
241:50 - will not use a hyphen L option like we
241:53 - don't want to lock anyone okay
241:55 - so uh you can do it or if you have guys
241:59 - any problem with this particular video
242:01 - or our previous video then you can ask
242:02 - us in our comment section okay so that's
242:04 - all for today and we will meet in the
242:06 - next video so thank you thank you for
242:07 - watching and if you have not subscribed
242:09 - our Channel then please subscribe it
242:10 - guys okay thank you
242:15 - this video we are going to cover about
242:16 - uh head command okay
242:18 - so head command is nothing but a simple
242:20 - command that we basically use to get the
242:23 - uh starting content of a particular txt
242:26 - file okay
242:27 - so uh when we will demonstrate and then
242:31 - you can easily get okay so let me open
242:33 - up the terminal
242:37 - I hope it is visible to you okay
242:40 - all right first create One Directory
242:41 - with a head
242:46 - okay and I'll create two files touch
242:51 - now I will create with cat command cat
242:54 - States dot XD
242:58 - okay and already I have entered the
243:01 - whatever the states
243:04 - okay I will just copy it here and I will
243:07 - paste it there okay
243:12 - enter Ctrl D to save and I will again
243:14 - create another command that is a
243:16 - capital.txt
243:21 - okay let me
243:23 - [Music]
243:24 - like this and again I will copy from
243:27 - this
243:31 - okay
243:36 - Ctrl D okay so we have created two files
243:39 - you can check with ls command if I will
243:40 - try to read the first
243:42 - here you can see and if I try to read
243:45 - second file that is capital
243:47 - here you can see okay so now we will use
243:50 - the head command okay so what I just
243:51 - said you like what is the head command
243:53 - hit command is nothing but which we use
243:55 - to print the starting content of a file
243:57 - so how we can get it so simply the
244:00 - command is head
244:01 - and just provide the file name whatever
244:04 - it is sales.txt till suppose okay I
244:08 - print uh I will hit enter and here you
244:11 - can see the first 10 lines you will get
244:13 - so by default what happens when you use
244:15 - the head command you get the first 10
244:17 - lines of our txt file so you can count
244:20 - here also like one two three four five
244:23 - six seven eight nine and ten okay so
244:26 - this is the one of the feature of the
244:27 - head command okay so if you want to like
244:30 - suppose you want to print only first two
244:32 - lines okay for this what you can do you
244:35 - have to nothing just provide the like
244:37 - hyphen air option or you can do it add
244:41 - iPhone and 2 and States Dot
244:45 - txt so here you can see we have only
244:48 - just got the only first two lines if you
244:52 - want to print first five lines then also
244:54 - you can do it like form
244:56 - five okay
244:59 - so and what if you want to like uh get
245:03 - the content of two files simultaneously
245:05 - how you can do it so it's also a simple
245:07 - command of it is like a head
245:15 - hit enter so here you can see the first
245:18 - 10 contents of both the files okay
245:21 - so
245:23 - now what if you want to print only first
245:27 - five
245:28 - or first five line of both the files so
245:31 - you can see here you can see three plus
245:33 - two five three plus two five okay
245:36 - so here we are getting five lines and
245:38 - here also we are getting five line so
245:40 - with the help of iPhone and option we
245:42 - can easily uh get uh whatever uh number
245:46 - of lines which you want to like display
245:48 - in the on this terminal okay
245:51 - and also there is another option that is
245:53 - a hyphen C option what it does so hyphen
245:55 - C option is nothing but like which we we
245:58 - use to get the uh like content of a
246:01 - particular size okay suppose if you want
246:03 - to print the content of only first like
246:07 - 30 bits or 10 bits so then for this we
246:10 - can use the hyphen C option okay
246:13 - so uh let's use it
246:16 - iPhone C I will provide uh
246:20 - so
246:22 - States dot txt so here you can see a and
246:25 - d h why this because this is only
246:28 - four bytes okay first four whites it
246:30 - will provide us and what if I want to
246:34 - hit 12
246:36 - so here you can see it is just me
246:38 - providing me the 12 bytes okay this is a
246:41 - three three six seven and again this is
246:44 - five seven plus five that is a 12 bytes
246:46 - okay
246:47 - so in this way you can use the hyphen 3
246:49 - option and also you can see use I think
246:52 - together also for Capital let me use
246:55 - and as you can see in a stress dot txt
246:57 - you are getting this and in hazarable
246:59 - you are getting
247:00 - this okay
247:03 - so uh and also there is one more option
247:05 - is remaining in this like hyphen V
247:07 - option what it does it basically just
247:09 - provide you the verbose information and
247:11 - hyphen us stand from verbose
247:13 - which basically shows you the like
247:15 - information about execution of command
247:18 - like that let me use it for States
247:21 - so here you can see stress dot tx3 like
247:24 - if we not use hyphen reaction then let's
247:26 - see what happens
247:28 - nothing okay
247:30 - so that's all guys for this particular
247:32 - video so I hope you liked it and we will
247:34 - meet in the next video okay so thank you
247:36 - thank you for watching
247:38 - now in this particular video we are
247:40 - going to learn about the tail command
247:42 - okay
247:43 - so similarly just like a head command L
247:45 - is also one command bin but in this we
247:48 - are like expect output from the downside
247:52 - or you can say the we try to get the
247:55 - output from the bottom of the txt file
247:57 - or any file like from which we want to
248:02 - like extract some kind of data like
248:04 - suppose you want to extract data from a
248:06 - log file like you need a last 10 number
248:09 - of lines if you need okay so in this
248:11 - case we can use the tail command okay so
248:14 - uh the basic uses like you can try to
248:18 - learn about uh like how you can read the
248:21 - log file using tail command and all
248:23 - these things so these are the basic uses
248:25 - of this
248:26 - so I have already two files uh stressed
248:29 - or text and capital.txt okay so let me
248:32 - show you these two files
248:34 - so this is the content of States Dot txt
248:39 - and this is the content of capital.txt
248:42 - okay
248:42 - so on these two files we are going to
248:44 - use the TL command okay so I will use
248:47 - first tail command on the stress dot txt
248:49 - so what it will do let's check so it
248:51 - will just print the last 10 lines okay
248:56 - so here you can see it is just printing
248:57 - the last 10 and you can like get the one
249:00 - two three four five six seven eight nine
249:03 - and ten okay so using the simple tail
249:06 - and the file name what you will get you
249:08 - will get that by default last 10 lines
249:10 - but to suppose if you want to more more
249:12 - lines so if you if you want 15 lines so
249:15 - how you can do it so nothing you just
249:17 - have to use iPhone n option and provide
249:19 - the number of lines which you want so I
249:21 - just want 15.
249:23 - so here I got the last 15 lines okay
249:28 - so you can use hyphen n option to get
249:30 - the last number of lines and similarly
249:33 - there is option of hyphen C option like
249:36 - which will provide you the like what you
249:39 - can say
249:41 - last number of specific bytes if you
249:43 - want suppose if I want uh
249:45 - 13 bytes
249:47 - I will use just hyphen C
249:50 - and 13.
249:52 - so you can see I'm getting just West
249:54 - Bengal let me try higher number
249:58 - 16 again I think I will get same okay
250:00 - nothing uh I I got like this West
250:03 - Pangolin and okay suppose if I want uh
250:07 - 20 bytes
250:10 - uh sorry
250:12 - if I want how much
250:16 - 20 so as you can see I'm getting 20
250:20 - bytes let's count like w one two three
250:23 - four five six seven eight nine ten
250:26 - eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
250:30 - sixteen Seventeen eighteen and also
250:33 - there will be like some kind of
250:35 - particular size for the spaces also okay
250:37 - so in this way we are getting the 20
250:39 - bytes like specific bits okay not bits
250:42 - bytes it is okay so you can use the
250:44 - iPhone C option to get the specific
250:46 - number of bits okay from a txt file or
250:49 - any kind of file
250:50 - so now if you want to get the like
250:54 - last 10 lines of both files or you can
250:58 - get it just simply use this command
251:00 - stress dot t uh hyphen n and the number
251:04 - of lines then provide the files file
251:06 - name which you want so I need
251:08 - data from two files so you can see you
251:11 - can get easily like from capital.txt
251:13 - these are the last 10 lines and from
251:15 - stress dot txt these are the last 10
251:18 - lines okay so apart from this uh there
251:21 - is also uh like a very interesting thing
251:25 - in which you will learn in this
251:27 - particular video that is a monitoring
251:29 - any like any txt file Suppose there is a
251:33 - log system or something like that and if
251:35 - you want to monitor it so how you can do
251:37 - it you you can use it just by applying
251:41 - tail command by which option you can use
251:43 - by using hyphen f okay so let's do it
251:48 - tail hyphen app states.txt okay
251:52 - so uh first let me show you the content
251:55 - of stress.txt so that will be clear to
251:57 - you so as you can see at the end we have
251:59 - only West Bengal okay
252:01 - so now I will use tail hyphen f States
252:04 - Dot txt and here you can see like it has
252:07 - to enter the last 10 lines and it is my
252:09 - monitoring this file so now what I will
252:12 - do I will just open up the again new
252:14 - terminal
252:16 - I hope it is visible to you I will move
252:18 - into the head directory
252:21 - [Music]
252:22 - and I have these two files and what I am
252:25 - going to do I will append some data in
252:28 - stress.txt
252:31 - and then here we you can see
252:37 - if I write something then it should
252:40 - reflect here
252:42 - hello okay so you can see Hello has been
252:45 - added if I want uh
252:49 - if I want to print Linux
252:53 - Fair India
252:55 - so here you can see whatever I'm writing
252:58 - here whatever I'm adding in this
253:00 - particular file it is get monitored by
253:02 - this system like tell if we have used
253:04 - the hyphen have option to monitor this
253:06 - since.txt file so whatever we are doing
253:08 - changes in that particular file it is
253:10 - reflecting here so in like this you can
253:13 - also use this particular thing in the
253:16 - like log monitoring system okay
253:19 - so have you liked it like that was the
253:21 - interesting part of this particular
253:22 - video I hope you liked it suppose we
253:24 - write anything else okay so here you can
253:27 - see it is getting like reflecting here
253:30 - okay and all these things will get added
253:32 - into this particular stress or text file
253:34 - now I will just save it and now again I
253:38 - will try to
253:39 - check the content so here you can see
253:41 - all those extra content has been added
253:43 - in that particular
253:44 - stress.txt file so that was the like
253:47 - most important or you can say most
253:51 - interesting thing of this particular
253:52 - video so I hope you liked it and please
253:55 - if you have any queries regarding this
253:57 - video so then you can ask us in the
253:59 - comment section okay so we will meet in
254:00 - the next video so thank you thank you
254:02 - for watching
254:04 - in this particular video we are going to
254:06 - cover about the CH own command that
254:09 - basically make change ownership command
254:11 - okay
254:11 - so before starting uh let me tell you
254:13 - the brief or a little bit introduction
254:16 - about this command basically it means
254:18 - what as the name suggests that change
254:20 - ownership what does it basically means
254:23 - uh let's take a scenario of a corporate
254:25 - world okay in which you are working in a
254:27 - team and there are people with different
254:30 - roles okay and if you have access of
254:32 - some kind of file and you want to share
254:35 - that file to some another team okay so
254:38 - in this case you can use the CH own
254:40 - command okay like there will be a one
254:42 - particular group for or one team and you
254:46 - want to give that access to some other
254:48 - team member or some other group member
254:52 - you can say okay
254:53 - so it basically means changing the
254:55 - ownership of a file or transferring the
254:57 - ownership to some other people or to
255:01 - some other user okay so we will start
255:04 - this uh okay so but before starting uh I
255:07 - will tell you to just set up your root
255:10 - account okay but because we will use
255:12 - root account and also want another user
255:14 - to perform this
255:16 - ah particular ch1 command Okay so to set
255:20 - up a root command first of all what you
255:21 - have to you have to just change the
255:23 - password if you don't know so enter the
255:25 - password command and the username that
255:26 - is a root
255:28 - and you have to just use a sudo and
255:34 - and now you can enter the new password
255:36 - which you want
255:38 - okay password related successfully and
255:42 - one more thing what we have to do I will
255:44 - add another user add user and I will
255:48 - give the name as a
255:54 - Avinash
255:56 - okay
255:57 - so enter a password
256:03 - I will not provide any kind of
256:05 - information okay yes okay so user has
256:08 - been created now what you will do first
256:10 - login as a root in this terminal
256:16 - uh wrong password I enter wrong password
256:21 - yeah now I'm logged in as a root user
256:24 - here you can see root and now again I
256:27 - will open up on another terminal in
256:28 - which I will log in with the credential
256:31 - of Avinash
256:33 - uh I hope it is visible to you now yeah
256:37 - it should be visible to you guys so now
256:39 - what we have to do uh we have to just
256:41 - log in as a different user that is a uh
256:44 - Avinash
256:46 - okay just enter the password of that
256:48 - particular user uh test uh
256:51 - Avinash okay so here we you can see uh I
256:54 - have another user in this terminal and
256:56 - another user in this terminal
256:58 - okay so this is the root user and this
257:01 - is the Avinash user okay
257:07 - so now both the user are in the home
257:09 - directory let me do here also same thing
257:12 - okay so with both the users are in the
257:15 - home directory okay so now what I have
257:17 - to do to see the permissions or to see
257:20 - anything uh permission of a file or
257:23 - directory or anything else which you
257:25 - want what what command you enter just
257:27 - you enter LS
257:30 - iPhone lyl just a long listing of files
257:33 - you can say like that okay so here you
257:36 - can see we have three directories and
257:38 - these are the some
257:39 - permissions based on those directory
257:41 - that is rewrite execute read
257:44 - ER and then for others there is no any
257:47 - permissions okay but these are the
257:49 - regarding what you can say these are
257:51 - regarding your
257:53 - um users like this is the user static
257:55 - tree but we don't have to work on this I
257:58 - will work on some different directories
258:00 - or different files okay
258:01 - so what I will do I will just create a
258:03 - one file that is touch file.txt
258:07 - and I will do LS hyphenyl and that
258:09 - particular file name so here you can see
258:10 - in this case uh if you have watched our
258:14 - previous videos on permissions okay so I
258:16 - think you will get it easily so these
258:19 - three represents the permissions of
258:21 - users
258:23 - and this is for groups and these are
258:26 - from others user so here you can see uh
258:29 - groups has only read permission and
258:31 - other others also has only read
258:33 - permissions okay
258:34 - but uh this particular user has a read
258:38 - and write a permission okay so who is
258:41 - the owner right now the owner right now
258:42 - is
258:44 - root root is the owner right now okay so
258:49 - now what uh you have to serve suppose or
258:51 - you have to think like that you have to
258:53 - share this file.txt to someone else to
258:56 - Avinash okay this user you have to share
259:00 - now what will happen list to a lesson I
259:02 - will try to access this file so I hope I
259:05 - can access because others have read
259:07 - permissions
259:09 - so let me hit enter this command so here
259:12 - you can see we have not got any error
259:13 - like permission denied so now what I
259:16 - will do I will just add one line in this
259:19 - particular file hi this is root user
259:25 - Ctrl D to save
259:27 - okay and now again I will try to access
259:30 - and here you can see I am able to access
259:32 - this file but if I will go to change the
259:36 - permission in this particular file then
259:38 - at that time what will happen if we will
259:39 - get an error of permission denied why
259:42 - why we will get error the reason behind
259:44 - is this that we don't have execute
259:48 - permissions okay so now what we have to
259:50 - do
259:51 - uh if I will try to add some extra lines
259:55 - in this file.txt so how we can do
259:58 - file.txt let's see if we are able to add
260:01 - or not so here you can see permission
260:03 - denied so okay as I said earlier like if
260:07 - we don't have permission like execute
260:08 - permission so to change the
260:12 - to change in the file okay
260:15 - so to do this we have two options one is
260:18 - change ownership just for one particular
260:21 - user or simply add execute permission
260:23 - for others using uh CH command okay
260:27 - change permission right CH mode command
260:30 - okay you can use that command to change
260:34 - the permission for all the users but
260:36 - that is not a useful case or that is not
260:40 - a best scenario because you don't want
260:42 - to share that file to all the users
260:44 - okay so that's why ch1 command came into
260:48 - this role and that's why we are using it
260:50 - so how you can do it
260:53 - just use CH own and whatever username
260:56 - you want to uh here our username is uh
261:00 - this particular username is I uh Avinash
261:03 - show Avinash and I will just provide the
261:06 - file name
261:07 - and done now I'll do LSI funnel and here
261:11 - you can see Avinash is now the
261:13 - uh new owner of that particular file so
261:16 - LS iPhone let me do two one more time
261:19 - yeah here you can see Avinash is the new
261:21 - owner
261:23 - sorry and now
261:28 - if I will try to change in this
261:29 - particular file then obviously I will be
261:32 - able to change here I will add just
261:37 - this line has been added by
261:42 - Avinash Ctrl D2 save and again I will
261:45 - try to access and here you can see this
261:49 - line has been added by
261:51 - which user
261:52 - Avinash
261:54 - okay we can also use multiple options
261:57 - with the ch1 command like ch1 hyphen C
262:00 - for uh what you can say for informations
262:05 - okay
262:06 - like it will display just like uh
262:08 - information like uh permission has been
262:11 - transformed from this user to this user
262:13 - let's do this uh with this again let's
262:15 - hope it works or not let's see CH on
262:19 - hyphen C and I will provide the username
262:21 - that is Avinash
262:23 - and file
262:26 - okay it's not showing me
262:30 - where do we
262:32 - okay ownership file.t extra detained as
262:35 - Avinash okay and you can see we have
262:37 - used iPhone V for warbus and it just
262:39 - displays the extra information
262:49 - um
262:50 - yeah it's still Avinash Okay so
262:54 - no worries so in this way CH own command
262:57 - works okay so I hope you like this video
262:59 - and I hope you got the concept of how
263:01 - ch1 works okay so that's all for today's
263:04 - now in this particular video we are
263:05 - going to cover about the CH group
263:07 - command it basically means the change
263:08 - group or you can say in the change group
263:11 - ownership okay from one group to another
263:13 - okay to understand this uh command just
263:17 - think like a basic scenario Suppose
263:19 - there is there are the two teams in a
263:20 - company that is the one for uh tester
263:22 - and another for the
263:24 - you can say a red developer okay
263:27 - suppose uh tester wants to share uh one
263:31 - file or to some other group members that
263:35 - is uh they these are some kind of group
263:37 - members okay so uh not for a particular
263:42 - member of that group but this team
263:45 - tester team wants to share those file to
263:47 - all the groups so in this scenario we
263:50 - can easily use this CH group command
263:52 - okay so in this kind of scenario it will
263:55 - be helpful
263:56 - because you don't have to share that
264:00 - file to one particular user okay so that
264:04 - if you share that file or change the
264:07 - ownership from from file to that group
264:09 - so every member of that particular you
264:12 - group can easily access the
264:15 - we can easily access that particular
264:17 - file okay so to understand the scenario
264:20 - first what we will need to do we will
264:22 - first need to create a group
264:23 - okay I hope it is visible to you guys uh
264:27 - so to add groups what is the command so
264:31 - the command is nothing but the
264:33 - group add and group name
264:36 - okay so what we will do group add
264:40 - and let's make a group name as a
264:42 - Developers
264:44 - foreign
264:47 - foreign
264:53 - sorry I went to wrong password I think
264:56 - yeah group has been created uh now what
264:59 - I will do I will just uh create two
265:00 - users
265:02 - add user
265:04 - user one
265:07 - again we have to use sudo
265:10 - password
265:13 - no extra information I have to provide
265:15 - yes user one is added user two
265:20 - test
265:22 - test
265:25 - yes both the user has been created now
265:28 - what we have to do we have to just uh
265:30 - add those two users into the developer
265:33 - group okay so how you can add those two
265:36 - user into a developer group so for that
265:38 - also we have a particular command that
265:39 - is a user modification so I will use
265:42 - pseudo user mod hyphen a and uh we use I
265:47 - think High fungi and the group name is
265:49 - developers and the name of the user that
265:52 - is a user
265:54 - user 1 and user two I hope it should
265:57 - work again not working user one if I
266:00 - provide
266:01 - I added and again use the two okay so
266:04 - groups has been added these two users
266:06 - have been added to the developer group
266:08 - to check what you can do
266:13 - and
266:14 - group okay so here you can see user one
266:17 - and user two and in developers we have
266:19 - two users that is user one and
266:22 - user tool okay so uh now what we have to
266:26 - do uh I will create a one file with our
266:29 - root user so first of all what I will do
266:31 - I will change my
266:34 - like switch to the root user
266:38 - I will go move back to directory in LS
266:42 - okay we have file.txt I will first
266:44 - remove
266:46 - file.txt and
266:49 - test
266:52 - okay both are due now what we have to do
266:54 - I will create one file that is Touch
266:57 - file dot txt okay so if I will change
267:00 - check the permissions for this
267:02 - particular file so here you can see we
267:06 - have root root the user is root and the
267:08 - group is also root user so in this case
267:11 - what we have to do we have to just
267:12 - change the group ownership not user like
267:15 - this one we have to change this group
267:17 - ownership to
267:19 - some other users or to some other group
267:22 - so but in this case here you can see in
267:24 - the permission we have the group has
267:26 - only read permission okay
267:28 - so now what we can do uh we can change
267:31 - the group
267:33 - from root 2 which group that is a
267:36 - developer group so for this we have a
267:38 - command that is CH group so how you can
267:41 - do it CH group
267:44 - ch
267:46 - grp and the group name is Developers
267:52 - okay developers and then what we have to
267:55 - do we have to just provide the file name
267:58 - okay now I will do LS hyphen and
268:00 - file.txt and here you can see the group
268:02 - name has been changed from root to
268:04 - developers okay so now what I will do I
268:07 - will login using uh both the user
268:11 - Su user one
268:13 - and I will enter the password test and
268:18 - again one more terminal I will open up
268:19 - here
268:22 - uh like this I will increase the font
268:25 - size so it should be visible to you
268:27 - and SEO which user that was user 2 okay
268:32 - and again enter the password same thing
268:36 - move back
268:40 - here also the same thing I will do I
268:42 - will move back on directory and I will
268:44 - do LS hyphen L and file.txt and here you
268:47 - can see developers and again here
268:53 - Developers okay
268:56 - wait a minute
269:03 - what key I just entered here
269:06 - LSI funnel file.txt okay so here you can
269:10 - see above in both the scenario we are
269:12 - getting developers as a group okay so
269:15 - now what I as a user one I will try to
269:18 - like change the
269:20 - some file content file.txt and here you
269:24 - can see it is showing me permission
269:26 - denied why it is showing permission
269:28 - denied because
269:31 - here you can see we have not added any
269:34 - kind of permission he has just read
269:37 - permissions okay
269:40 - so now what we can do uh
269:48 - okay so we have only the read permission
269:51 - here for the groups okay so if I will
269:53 - just uh try to access so I can just only
269:57 - read this file.txt but if I want to uh
270:01 - add some kind of text or add something
270:03 - in that particular file so here you can
270:06 - see the permission is
270:07 - denied so now what we will need to do we
270:10 - will need to just add permission for the
270:12 - groups for that particular file okay so
270:14 - how we can do it using the CH mode
270:16 - command just because uh we don't have uh
270:20 - like execute permission to the groups
270:22 - that's why we are getting this error so
270:24 - CH mode of what you have to do for Group
270:25 - G plus I will do uh write an execute and
270:29 - I will remove the read permission uh for
270:32 - others and the file name that is file
270:34 - Dot txt
270:36 - and done and now in this case I will
270:39 - just read check
270:42 - so here you can see uh read write
270:45 - execute has been added for groups and uh
270:48 - read has been removed from for others
270:51 - okay and the group is developers as we
270:53 - performed earlier so now what we can do
270:56 - uh if I will try to access this file
271:00 - that file file.txt so now let's try for
271:04 - user one I will remove all those things
271:06 - so cat
271:09 - file dot txt so here you can see I will
271:13 - just hide this line has been entered by
271:19 - user one Ctrl D to save and again here
271:24 - also uh I will I will here I will try to
271:28 - access this file
271:30 - ah sorry file.txt
271:33 - and here you can see that line I am
271:35 - getting and for user 2 also I will try
271:38 - to enter some line
271:41 - with respect to user 2 that is high
271:45 - this line has been added by user 2.
271:53 - Ctrl D to save and again I will try to
271:56 - access so let's access my user one
272:01 - not user one it's file Dot txt
272:05 - and here you can see both the lines has
272:07 - been added and it is accessible by both
272:10 - the users so this is the benefit of like
272:12 - group command like you can
272:15 - you don't have to share that file with
272:18 - each and every user Suppose there there
272:21 - is a team of 50 members okay so uh you
272:24 - you you can't like you can't just share
272:27 - those files to all those 50 people
272:30 - separately okay so that's why we have
272:33 - this group command change group
272:35 - ownership and just
272:38 - like that file will be accessible by
272:40 - each and every group member so guys
272:44 - that's all for today's video on this
272:45 - video we are going to start to post
272:48 - videos on networking okay like whatever
272:50 - the commands which are used in the
272:52 - networking domain now Linux operating
272:54 - system those are the commands which we
272:56 - will learn so for basically we will
272:58 - start with the First Command that is the
273:00 - Ping command okay
273:01 - so before starting uh the Ping command I
273:04 - hope you are aware of the basics of
273:05 - networking if not then let me tell you
273:07 - about like from scratch okay
273:10 - so these are the computers uh for
273:12 - support this these are the two computers
273:13 - okay and we are the two companies and
273:15 - they are connected to each other so now
273:17 - what happens in this case they basically
273:18 - form a kind of network what happens when
273:21 - multiple devices connected to each other
273:23 - okay so that process just called as a
273:26 - networking okay so in the networking
273:28 - there are many Concepts like uh what is
273:31 - an IP address what is a MAC address uh
273:34 - like uh different network topologies
273:37 - okay so we don't have to discuss that
273:39 - much thing particularly in this video so
273:41 - basically you just need about what is an
273:43 - IP address okay
273:44 - so uh let me tell you about the basics
273:47 - of IP address that you can think one of
273:50 - analogy is like
273:54 - uh what you can say just like in a
273:57 - family uh everyone has a separate name
274:00 - okay
274:00 - suppose one one name as ayush
274:04 - Ankita anything okay they are the
274:07 - siblings and they know each their names
274:09 - okay
274:10 - so similarly you know what network what
274:12 - happens each device has their own name
274:14 - or their IP address okay so basically
274:18 - and I bet it's just an address which
274:21 - identifies a device on a network okay I
274:26 - hope that is a clear to you so what is
274:28 - an IP address and also there is a
274:30 - concept of Mac address
274:31 - so my encourages you can think like of
274:34 - it as a fingerprint of a person suppose
274:36 - a person changes his name or her name
274:39 - but he can't change their fingerprint
274:41 - okay it will be always same
274:45 - so that's why Mac address is just like a
274:47 - permanent idea that is like a printed on
274:50 - your NIC card okay in your PC
274:55 - so now we will start with the Ping
274:56 - command
274:57 - ah
274:59 - let me enter the password
275:07 - I hope there are terminally visible or
275:10 - let me increase the font size
275:13 - okay
275:15 - so now what is a ping command so ping
275:18 - command is basically a simple command
275:19 - which you basically use to uh check
275:22 - whether the our like host is reachable
275:26 - or not suppose
275:28 - I will enter google.com so what
275:31 - google.com is kind of one of the host
275:33 - okay or you can see domain name
275:35 - so I will try to check whether I am able
275:38 - to reach there or not okay
275:41 - google.com so here you can see I am
275:44 - getting multiple uh requests from them
275:47 - now I will just hit Ctrl C to stop it
275:50 - okay so here you can see this is the 64
275:53 - bytes uh like uh packet size what uh so
275:57 - now what is a packet
275:59 - okay so packet is basically just like a
276:01 - data you can think of it like a data
276:04 - that is that transfers suppose you send
276:06 - a image then it can it gets divided into
276:09 - different small small packets or chunks
276:12 - then it is transferred so packet is just
276:14 - like a you can think as a small data
276:17 - okay
276:19 - so basically what happens when you ping
276:21 - uh and when you use a ping command so it
276:25 - basically what sends the icmp Eco
276:28 - request which basically means that is
276:30 - internet control message protocol
276:32 - request okay so icmp is just a one of a
276:35 - protocol that is used by the Ping
276:38 - command okay to like for that these are
276:41 - for this purpose like for receiving or
276:44 - for sending like Eco request and Eco
276:47 - response is one of the thing which comes
276:49 - in this role okay
276:51 - so whenever it's in that is called as
276:53 - the icmp equal request and whenever it
276:55 - received and that is called as the icmp
276:57 - equal response okay so there are
277:00 - multiple attributes here you can see
277:01 - like what is this uh sequence number dtl
277:04 - okay so I will cover like most important
277:06 - things first this is from it means it is
277:10 - just and the what you can say it is just
277:12 - the IP address of this Google.com
277:16 - okay so google.com is identified by
277:20 - this IP address
277:22 - like from where this request is coming
277:24 - that is 64 bytes is coming from where so
277:28 - it is coming from this IP address this
277:30 - is maybe the domain name or something
277:31 - like that or servers maybe we don't know
277:35 - about it what is this okay
277:37 - image domain from where this is coming
277:39 - but we know that this is the IP address
277:41 - IP address of this Google.com
277:44 - this is what detail is nothing but a
277:45 - time to leave it basically means like
277:48 - how many hopes or how many routers uh
277:51 - this process has covered okay
277:54 - and time is just like uh how much time
277:57 - it took to get the response or send the
278:01 - response it basically means what
278:03 - happened the total time
278:04 - so first this is our PC this is
278:06 - google.com Okay
278:08 - so it will ask for are you there are you
278:11 - alive or not Google reply and Google
278:15 - will just reply yes I am alive okay
278:19 - so uh this is the total time that is uh
278:22 - here it is where it is uh here this one
278:24 - this is 133 millisecond okay so at what
278:27 - happens at in one second there at least
278:30 - I think four to five packets or request
278:33 - four to five request as the end
278:35 - okay so being company we basically use
278:39 - for the like intent connectivity
278:42 - purposes further we will check about
278:44 - another commonly the Trace Road ipconfig
278:46 - if count if config sorry we will learn
278:49 - about all those things I hope uh you
278:51 - liked this video and now in this video
278:53 - we are going to talk about the most
278:54 - important command that is the trace root
278:56 - command okay
278:57 - so now in this video we will discuss
278:59 - about this particular command so before
279:01 - starting the actual implementation of
279:03 - this command let me discuss with you the
279:05 - like basics of this Trace root command
279:08 - okay so what are the basics of Trace
279:10 - root command as the name subject
279:12 - suggests Trace root what does it mean it
279:15 - just means you are tracing a root okay
279:18 - uh just uh think like an example like
279:22 - you have to go from like uh Mumbai to
279:25 - Bangalore okay so you can go from
279:28 - different routes and you will first
279:30 - Trace like how you can go to that
279:32 - destination okay so Trace root is a
279:36 - command which is used to find the what
279:38 - are the number of hopes hopes means you
279:41 - can say number of routers which are
279:43 - included between your source and the
279:45 - destination
279:47 - okay so we will start with this so
279:50 - basically uh actually I have an image
279:51 - for you also like Suppose there is a
279:54 - source and this is the destination and
279:56 - these are the number of routers included
279:58 - between the source and destination okay
280:01 - so Trace router which will tell you like
280:03 - what are the number of hopes present
280:06 - between source and destination like in
280:08 - our list today's implementation we will
280:10 - see uh like uh
280:14 - the number of Hoops which will be uh
280:17 - included between all this local machine
280:21 - and the
280:23 - google.com Okay so for the in Ubuntu
280:27 - actually trace route
280:29 - does not come with pre-install so we
280:31 - will need to install it like if you hit
280:33 - this command then you will get uh this
280:35 - error message or you will get a citation
280:37 - too
280:39 - first enter this command to install
280:41 - Tracer so we will do this sudo apt
280:43 - install tray so deputy just a packet
280:46 - manager you can say okay
280:49 - and password
280:50 - [Music]
280:54 - and now it will install your Trace root
280:56 - command okay
280:58 - so it will take a little bit of time
281:03 - let's wait for it
281:07 - so it's also just like a trace root
281:09 - command just also you can say like a
281:11 - ping command okay like we can use it
281:13 - also for checking the weather uh the
281:16 - particular server of particular host is
281:18 - reachable or not
281:20 - okay
281:21 - so uh now we will start with the Trace
281:24 - would command Okay so first of all uh I
281:27 - will clear the screen and hypo review
281:29 - visible to you so Trace root
281:32 - google.com
281:34 - okay
281:36 - so here you can see the first four page
281:42 - 10.0.2.1 it's like basically the
281:45 - uh what you can say
281:48 - gateway address like the first address
281:51 - through which my piece is getting
281:53 - connected
281:55 - and the star means like it is whether we
281:58 - are not getting any response or
282:00 - something like that
282:01 - okay
282:04 - so here you can see we didn't get any
282:06 - kind of response I don't know why uh
282:10 - this is it's showing me star star and
282:12 - the star means unreachable host so you
282:15 - can say like uh or not on reachable it
282:18 - means like you are not getting response
282:20 - okay and the maximum hopes uh can be it
282:24 - will try for 30.
282:26 - okay uh let me again check whether
282:30 - management is working or not
282:32 - okay internet is working fine
282:35 - okay
282:37 - five packet transmitter five receive
282:39 - zero percent loss let me try with again
282:42 - Trace root with a DNS server let me try
282:48 - first gateway
282:49 - [Music]
282:52 - again same that star means like not
282:55 - responding
282:58 - uh here you can see the maximum of hops
283:00 - can be 30.
283:02 - okay
283:05 - at least it should show something
283:07 - [Music]
283:11 - okay let's hope
283:16 - [Music]
283:20 - okay so it's still uh as trick so it's
283:23 - not strict by not getting response
283:26 - okay let me check the network setting
283:28 - here
283:31 - okay it's some Breeze adapter
283:35 - okay
283:38 - uh let me try again
283:41 - Trace root
283:44 - google.com
283:47 - first we'll get it okay yeah now now we
283:49 - are getting you here you can see from
283:51 - second and third hope so we are not
283:53 - getting any kind of response so asterisk
283:55 - basically means uh we are not getting
283:58 - any response from that particular router
284:01 - or you can say oops okay
284:04 - so now here you can see the first
284:05 - gateway like Gateway and Gateway just
284:08 - means like though
284:10 - very first router or very first uh you
284:14 - can say what you call the gate like
284:17 - through which your packet will pass like
284:19 - the very first router you can say
284:21 - Gateway just like a your first router
284:24 - okay suppose you are connected to a
284:26 - hotspot okay then your phone will be off
284:29 - it will act as a first router okay first
284:32 - gateway or whether your phone is
284:34 - connected to the your ISP or anything
284:37 - else you can say or just take an example
284:40 - of your Wi-Fi
284:42 - if you're connected to a Wi-Fi then the
284:44 - first request will be passed through
284:46 - your Wi-Fi then it will be connected to
284:48 - some another router then another router
284:50 - then another option okay then finally
284:52 - you will reach to the
284:54 - destination
284:55 - so here you can see uh we are getting
284:57 - many results here like
284:59 - uh I think we have covered
285:03 - approx of 14 hopes here okay let's check
285:09 - whether it will come in one line let me
285:11 - increase this okay
285:13 - I think now it's better yeah
285:17 - uh so now here you can see the first
285:19 - gateway like from which we are getting
285:22 - the response
285:25 - and these are the time like uh what you
285:28 - can say uh
285:30 - ground trip times like from
285:34 - like when we go and then when we come
285:37 - back then the overall time okay so here
285:40 - you can see uh the different IP
285:42 - addresses of different routers then the
285:45 - total time taken by them
285:47 - these are all the details you can see
285:49 - and I tell us here you can see we
285:51 - reached to the destination
285:53 - okay
285:55 - and uh
285:57 - okay wait is to the destination
286:00 - yes
286:02 - so it overall take 84.1 for one
286:04 - millisecond
286:06 - [Music]
286:08 - okay so again let me try with uh some
286:11 - other uh
286:13 - website like let's take our IBM
286:16 - ibm.com
286:21 - [Music]
286:30 - I think my internet connectivity is slow
286:33 - today that's why taking much time
286:38 - so you can see you are getting different
286:40 - uh
286:43 - IP addresses of different routers okay
286:49 - let's wait
286:55 - okay so we have covered seven ropes
287:03 - 10 11 12 13 we are not getting any kind
287:05 - of response
287:07 - again no no response no response we're
287:10 - getting
287:12 - oh my God okay
287:15 - maximum hope is 30 so I don't think it
287:18 - will get complete
287:21 - okay
287:25 - okay no problem
287:27 - let me think about some other website uh
287:31 - Which is popular one uh let's take uh
287:36 - which website should I take man
287:42 - Trace food
287:47 - let me search for a new website
287:57 - booking.com okay let's check for
287:59 - booking.com
288:04 - booking.com
288:09 - [Music]
288:23 - foreign
288:24 - [Music]
288:34 - like here you can see like all this line
288:36 - represents the information about that
288:38 - particular hopes like the fifth one is
288:41 - the type address of that okay this like
288:44 - two two three Dot 196.2.5
288:49 - okay
288:51 - [Music]
288:54 - and also it shows us the round trip time
288:57 - rounded up I hope you got it like uh
288:59 - from sending packet to receiving back
289:03 - like from requesting to response
289:06 - okay this is the round trip time
289:12 - so here you can see we have got still uh
289:14 - seven hopes
289:16 - uh let's wait
289:19 - let's eat now
289:21 - [Music]
289:29 - [Music]
289:40 - okay I think we have reached
289:44 - like we're getting the booking.com so
289:49 - approximately we have reached
289:54 - [Music]
289:56 - okay now it will get uh
289:59 - yeah completed
290:02 - okay so here we are not getting any kind
290:05 - of responses from the particular uh what
290:09 - you can say
290:11 - particular hopes why it happens it may
290:13 - be because of they are unresponsive or
290:16 - they are turned off or whether it's also
290:18 - because of the firewall regions like
290:19 - some of the firewalls does not reply
290:21 - back to this ping requester or icmp
290:24 - packet here also interested also we are
290:27 - sending that that icmp packet like
290:29 - internal what the what was the full form
290:32 - that it is internet control message
290:33 - protocol yeah we can say it like that
290:36 - okay
290:37 - so some of the routers are not routers
290:39 - some of the firewalls does not reply
290:40 - back to those packets that's why we are
290:42 - getting this it may be a one kind of
290:44 - region or whether they are returned over
290:46 - we don't know okay but still here you
290:49 - can see we have approximately released
290:52 - because the head I can see the domain
290:54 - name of their of their website that is
290:56 - booking.com
290:57 - okay
291:00 - so it may be one of the reason
291:03 - uh also we can use uh some different
291:05 - options with this stress root command
291:07 - like hyphen n options for like better
291:09 - View and let's try uh with hyphen and
291:12 - what
291:13 - looks like let's try
291:15 - okay
291:19 - [Music]
291:21 - okay now damn
291:24 - as you can see like uh as soon like very
291:28 - fast we got the result
291:31 - so you can see 192
291:34 - uh first hope second third on responsive
291:39 - one not eight dot
291:43 - 170.248.21 on whether it is the
291:46 - our last node uh let me check with ping
291:50 - I don't think because it started with
291:52 - 142 yeah
291:54 - okay so this is not the address which we
291:57 - were expecting
291:59 - [Music]
292:00 - um
292:02 - but
292:03 - 142.251 okay
292:07 - so here it should show me that
292:09 - particular uh like the last IP address
292:14 - I was expecting this address
292:17 - okay let's try with uh
292:24 - other website
292:25 - yahoo.com
292:29 - not Yahoo it's Yahoo
292:34 - okay I have not used hyphen and option
292:37 - let me use that
292:41 - [Music]
292:46 - [Music]
292:48 - okay so here also we can see like 74.60
292:52 - Dot like uh
292:56 - here you can see the first and Octane
292:58 - and second octet is same then
293:00 - we can we are in
293:03 - in the network we can say like that
293:06 - okay
293:08 - so basically like this would come and
293:10 - just use to find a number of hopes which
293:13 - um lies between the source and the
293:16 - destination okay
293:18 - so we are getting asterisk and not
293:20 - getting responses just because of their
293:21 - firewall uh settings like uh
293:24 - it shows us the like don't reply to the
293:27 - icmb packet equation maybe for the
293:30 - security regions uh because there is a
293:33 - tool in our Linux or Curry Linux system
293:35 - that is the nmap which we use for the
293:37 - network scanning okay
293:39 - so we also face that error now because
293:44 - when we go with the network testing then
293:46 - in that case we basically get that error
293:51 - so that's why uh no any company or no
293:53 - any organization want
293:56 - to uh what we can say they don't want to
293:59 - replace anyone
294:00 - you can say like that
294:02 - okay so that's all for today's video
294:04 - guys and I hope you liked it and yeah if
294:07 - you have any queries then please ask us
294:09 - in the comment section yeah but before
294:11 - ending this video I have to
294:13 - show you one more thing for you like for
294:16 - Windows
294:17 - I know it's still uh in a series but uh
294:21 - day suit is a command which we can use
294:23 - on both windows and the Linux but in
294:25 - Windows we just use this one Trace CRT
294:30 - and again let's enter google.com
294:34 - and here you can see the first hope it
294:36 - is taking 32 to
294:38 - millisecond 2 millisecond and the IP
294:40 - address the IP address of the first rope
294:43 - okay
294:46 - so let's wait for some time
294:49 - it I don't think it will take much time
294:52 - uh okay for second hop request timed out
294:57 - again yeah yeah
295:01 - I will take this I don't think more than
295:04 - 15 seconds now
295:08 - so here also it is just sending the icmp
295:11 - packet request
295:13 - okay when we will start with the
295:15 - networking if in future then you will
295:17 - get to know about the what are the
295:19 - different protocols used okay like for
295:23 - web we use HTTP https protocol and also
295:27 - we use different uh for remote
295:29 - connectivity we use SSH FTP so we will
295:33 - learn all about these like how we can do
295:35 - with all these in our ax operating
295:39 - system
295:41 - let's wait
295:45 - [Music]
295:51 - now eight hops
295:54 - I think in Windows it's working fine
295:57 - um
296:04 - now nine
296:07 - it is unresponsive Maybe
296:09 - [Music]
296:10 - yeah to a state three and the third one
296:13 - will come up yeah
296:15 - and the tenth one is here
296:19 - let's check what will be the IP address
296:21 - of this
296:28 - k123
296:35 - I just want to ask you one question like
296:36 - do you know about the uh
296:38 - IPv6 address if yes then yeah please
296:42 - comment
296:43 - comment about this IP address about IPv6
296:46 - address
296:47 - [Music]
296:48 - Okay so
296:52 - okay finally I think we have reached to
296:55 - the destination with the number of hops
296:58 - is 14 okay yeah now now here you can see
297:00 - uh this is
297:04 - 142.250.192.46 it is the same IP address
297:08 - and the destination IP address is also
297:11 - the same okay so in this way uh we are
297:15 - getting uh like the number of different
297:17 - hopes like uh we started from first and
297:21 - till 14 we reached to that our
297:24 - particular destination
297:26 - so this is the beauty of this command
297:27 - okay so I hope you like this because at
297:31 - the end we got our like particular
297:34 - result like required result because it
297:38 - will show the like exact uh utility of
297:41 - this command like uh
297:44 - we are requesting for this and still
297:48 - again we are getting the same thing like
297:50 - we are getting the destination address
297:52 - the same as the IP address okay
297:55 - so that's all guys so if you have any
297:57 - query then please ask now in this
297:59 - particular video we are going to learn
298:00 - about one of the most important command
298:02 - that is the MTR command okay
298:04 - so basically uh MTR command is nothing
298:06 - but uh like combination of the two
298:08 - commas which we have learned in our
298:10 - previous videos that is the Ping and the
298:12 - trace root command
298:13 - so now in this video we are going to
298:15 - learn about uh this and we will use like
298:18 - see the both the features of the pink
298:20 - command and the trace route command in
298:22 - this particular single command okay
298:24 - so let's start with the
298:26 - basic
298:28 - like what we have to write that is MTR
298:31 - and enter the then host name I will just
298:34 - go with google.com and hit enter
298:37 - okay so here we you can see like uh this
298:40 - is refreshing again and again and again
298:42 - okay so basically what's happening here
298:44 - you can see the uh you will get the
298:47 - percentage loss and all the what are the
298:50 - number of packets and whatever has
298:51 - received average based and all these
298:53 - things okay
298:54 - so basically What's Happening Here you
298:56 - here you can see the number of hops like
298:59 - from our
299:01 - what you could say from our source to
299:02 - the destination okay so there are approx
299:06 - 10 hops here in this case
299:08 - so uh like basically with this command
299:10 - you are getting the overall uh what you
299:13 - can say overall statistics and what
299:15 - happens in this particular command as
299:16 - you can see this page is refreshing
299:18 - again and again and again so we started
299:20 - from zero and now we are still at here
299:22 - you can see we are at uh 48 again 49.50
299:25 - so what is this happening this is
299:26 - basically nothing but uh
299:28 - the Ping request okay so here uh this
299:32 - command like what it does it sends pin
299:35 - request again and again and again
299:37 - so uh with pink Rick is what we send we
299:40 - send the which protocol we use icmp like
299:43 - internet control message protocol we use
299:45 - okay
299:46 - so uh here you can see that again I will
299:49 - like uh run this command to stop this we
299:54 - have to just hit Q
299:56 - and it will stop
299:58 - okay again let me check with the for
300:00 - another domain uh let's try for
300:03 - gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try for
300:07 - facebook.com
300:10 - so here you can see here also we are
300:13 - getting a 10 hops
300:14 - so there is no any packet loss here in
300:17 - this case
300:19 - okay so this is the again at 11 times
300:22 - that is 13 14 15 16 all these things you
300:26 - can see so to control the your what you
300:28 - can say ping request time like suppose
300:30 - you want to Ping again after some some
300:34 - after some seconds like suppose you want
300:36 - to Ping after two seconds so how you can
300:38 - do it so for this we use a special
300:40 - function not function we will say just
300:42 - it is uh just an option that is a hyphen
300:45 - I option okay so let's use that MTR
300:49 - hyphen I
300:52 - and we will specify the time for 2
300:55 - second and
300:59 - for domain name let's go with the
301:01 - YouTube
301:05 - okay so here you can see now it's not
301:08 - like earlier like it's sending the Ping
301:10 - request after two seconds so you can see
301:13 - the like change in the frequency of
301:16 - sending packets okay so here you can see
301:18 - F4 now seven now eight so it's slow
301:21 - slower than earlier okay
301:24 - so in this way you can control the ping
301:27 - request
301:28 - and here you can see the IP addresses of
301:30 - all the hopes which are which lies
301:33 - between our from the source and
301:34 - destination
301:35 - okay so and now moving forward uh
301:39 - suppose if you want to uh display only
301:42 - the what you can say
301:44 - only iPad is not host names like
301:46 - actually we are getting here uh IP area
301:49 - but still there is option of hyphen and
301:52 - so we will use it let me clear the
301:54 - screen MTR hyphen n and uh
301:57 - let's take some basic one uh our Indian
302:01 - website
302:02 - let me search
302:08 - not brave
302:10 - let me open Chrome
302:18 - okay I will search for
302:20 - let's search for blockchain
302:23 - so here okay here is the one website
302:26 - Investopedia okay
302:28 - or here is also blockchain.com is also
302:30 - one kind of website let's let me check
302:32 - it as I've
302:34 - yeah it's live okay we can
302:38 - find the
302:40 - IP and all what are the
302:42 - hops present between this
302:45 - so let me
302:47 - go like this first blockchain.com
302:50 - okay accessible
302:52 - one zero four okay
302:55 - okay
302:56 - now what I will do I will use the
303:01 - hyphen n option
303:04 - blockchain.com
303:06 - so here you can see only iPad is as
303:09 - earlier also we were getting only IP
303:10 - address but so what happens in some
303:12 - cases we get the host names okay
303:15 - we get the host names in place of these
303:18 - IP addresses okay so these are basically
303:20 - your ipv4 added whatever your 32-bit
303:22 - addresses okay
303:24 - how we will learn about more about in
303:26 - networking part okay about ipv4 address
303:30 - and IPv6 address okay so moving forward
303:32 - in this video so we will go with uh one
303:36 - of the like uh option with in which we
303:39 - store the output in different different
303:42 - files like the different formats you can
303:44 - say like we can store in XML we can
303:46 - store ingestion and also we can store in
303:49 - uh like other videos
303:52 - file format we can say I'm not getting
303:56 - what are the file formats let me check
303:59 - with uh
304:01 - okay so now here we will see
304:04 - uh what are the file formats so
304:10 - um
304:11 - hyphen B naught
304:13 - this one local environment packet
304:22 - okay CSV is also there
304:27 - okay
304:30 - here we can see if yeah here you can see
304:32 - iPhone iPhone XML is there we can use
304:34 - hyphen iPhone XML for storing the output
304:36 - in
304:37 - like this okay
304:41 - so let me try with this hyphen hyphen
304:44 - XML google.com whether I will need to
304:47 - provide path or not I don't know
304:53 - okay
304:56 - Ctrl C to stop take one minute
305:00 - I will create One Directory
305:02 - uh
305:06 - 3D blockchain
305:09 - and NTR iPhone iPhone XML
305:14 - google.com
305:17 - and now it will be sending like it's not
305:19 - displaying us here I will just hit Ctrl
305:21 - CLS okay no files has been created
305:24 - uh
305:26 - my front wall
305:29 - street.xml whether it's lock or not
305:33 - okay it's not working
305:36 - let me check
305:40 - okay uh let's try with CSV
305:48 - okay it's not printing anything
305:52 - I don't know what's the problem here uh
305:56 - basically what happens it displays the
305:59 - output in that particular format like if
306:01 - a head is CS with then comma separated
306:03 - values okay yeah okay we got it now so
306:06 - here you can see uh like this is the
306:08 - comma separated output in this case and
306:11 - if I will try with the XML uh
306:14 - actually uh file is not created the
306:17 - output is displayed in that particular
306:19 - format okay let's wait for two to three
306:22 - seconds so I hope it will work
306:28 - sweet
306:35 - okay so here you can see uh the output
306:38 - in the XML format
306:40 - nice
306:42 - okay so moving forward uh what I will do
306:45 - uh I will use some other function not
306:49 - function I will use some other uh
306:51 - options in which we can like uh create a
306:55 - one file in which you will add some
306:56 - domain names and then we will call that
306:58 - file and use this particular command
307:01 - what I'm just trying to say you let me
307:03 - create one file so just remember how you
307:06 - can create file in Linux we will just
307:09 - use Touch command
307:13 - okay I will enter
307:16 - domain
307:18 - Dot txt and I will write first
307:21 - google.com
307:23 - facebook.com
307:27 - instagram.com okay that's enough Ctrl D
307:31 - to save
307:32 - okay let me check the content of this
307:34 - file not 50 what was the name domain
307:36 - yeah okay here is the domain uh now I
307:40 - will use MTR I will use hyphen f capital
307:42 - F option
307:44 - and provide the
307:47 - uh
307:51 - domain.txt
307:54 - and then the
307:57 - just it I think that's it
308:01 - okay
308:02 - so here you can see we are getting
308:04 - result for google.com
308:12 - okay
308:18 - so here you can see the Ping request
308:20 - everything we can see here
308:22 - all statistics
308:27 - okay now further we will see how we can
308:29 - set the Ping okay so like uh normally
308:32 - what happens it sends approx 10 things
308:35 - request okay
308:37 - like one to ten
308:40 - okay if we want for only five how we can
308:43 - do MTR
308:45 - iPhone C5
308:47 - google.com
308:51 - this is third fourth and the last one is
308:54 - fifth that's it
308:56 - so only five packets have been sent okay
309:00 - okay uh yeah again so here you can see
309:03 - this percentage loss here we can see the
309:06 - maximum percentage loss we don't know
309:09 - why and send
309:12 - okay wait a minute I have to just to
309:15 - explain some things that's why so this
309:18 - is the last the average time this is the
309:20 - best time the what what time I am trying
309:23 - to tell you like this is a round trip
309:24 - time like when the packet goes from the
309:27 - source to destination and then the
309:29 - packet like the DC sender receives the
309:32 - response from the
309:34 - receiver like that time that is a round
309:36 - trip time okay so this is the average
309:38 - best worst and this is the standard
309:40 - deviation
309:41 - okay
309:44 - latency is something uh this is the last
309:46 - one
309:48 - so guys that's all for this video and I
309:51 - hope you liked it and if you have any
309:53 - queries then please ask us in the
309:54 - comment section so thank you thank you
309:57 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
309:58 - video
310:02 - on this particular video we are going to
310:04 - learn about host command okay so
310:07 - basically this command is used for the
310:09 - DNS lookup it basically means you are
310:11 - going to find information about the DNS
310:13 - servers as well the IP addresses of a
310:16 - domain name or or domain name with IP
310:20 - address you can say so but before moving
310:23 - forward in this particular video you
310:24 - should know the basics of domain name
310:26 - server okay so this is basically one of
310:29 - the networking Concept in which we will
310:33 - learn okay
310:34 - in the following topics like I actually
310:36 - have written already one blog on DNS
310:38 - so you can go and learn from this
310:40 - infosec write-ups and if you will search
310:43 - for all about DNS 100 days of hacking
310:46 - you will get it let me search it for you
310:53 - in four SEC write-ups
310:58 - okay so this is the first one write up
311:00 - by ayush Verma okay you can get it from
311:03 - here
311:04 - so let me tell you the basic idea of
311:06 - what is this domain name server and all
311:09 - these things so basically DNS stands for
311:11 - domain name server okay
311:14 - it means the whatever the your
311:17 - google.com it is a domain name it will
311:20 - get converted into the IP address or
311:22 - vice versa or IP address will get
311:24 - converted into the domain so with the
311:27 - main reason behind this is domain name
311:29 - service why this domain name server came
311:32 - in a role okay
311:34 - so just think like a normal human if you
311:37 - uh you are given one address like
311:39 - 192.168.42.35
311:43 - whether this is easily remember easy to
311:47 - remember or google.com is easy to
311:49 - remember okay just think once so
311:51 - obviously you will say like sir
311:53 - google.com is easy to remember that's
311:55 - why that is the main reason behind this
311:57 - of DNS that's why it came in a role so
312:00 - we will see the basically working of how
312:02 - it basically works let me move down
312:06 - as here you can see the I have written
312:09 - like in more explanation I have given
312:11 - here you can learn it
312:13 - and also how it works I will tell you
312:16 - and this is the domain High key like
312:18 - root level domain top level domain
312:20 - second level domain like.com dot
312:23 - government Dot
312:25 - mil these are the root level domains
312:27 - okay
312:28 - and try hack my Google USA sub domains
312:32 - okay so you can learn all about these
312:34 - things and now let's moving forward to
312:37 - the working of
312:39 - this DNS okay so whenever user types in
312:42 - web address this particular
312:45 - grow my name what happens in this case
312:47 - it will first do the DNS query from
312:49 - where DNS resolver okay DNS is always
312:53 - also one of the part of this particular
312:55 - process where summary codes are stored
312:58 - now next what will happen it will send
313:00 - the request to this root server whether
313:02 - if the
313:03 - dominionadv.com or dot anything it will
313:06 - move to the root server it will ask for
313:07 - do you have this IP address of this
313:10 - particular domain if it will say yes
313:12 - then it will forward the request
313:14 - then again fourth step it will go with
313:17 - the TLD server and again with authority
313:19 - name server and after that it will go to
313:23 - the main server of that particular
313:25 - website after getting the IP address
313:27 - okay so this is the overall working of
313:29 - this domain name server
313:31 - and now we will talk about the what are
313:34 - the records in DNS okay so basically DNS
313:37 - request provide the information about
313:39 - the particular domain
313:41 - so I will
313:43 - like go down and let me tell you the
313:46 - records okay
313:47 - so these are the basically some of the
313:49 - records like a records this four a
313:52 - records I mix the chord c name record
313:54 - you can learn about these all things
313:55 - like 80 cost provide us the ipv4
313:57 - addresses and AAA and also one more day
314:01 - that is a 4A record providers the IPv6
314:04 - address MX3 cost provide us the
314:07 - like Mail Exchange address CNM record is
314:09 - also provides like like it points the
314:12 - subdomain to the main domain basically
314:14 - if there is a
314:16 - gmail.google.com or google.com both will
314:19 - point to the only single domain or it's
314:21 - not domain single IP addresses okay
314:25 - now moving this is the name server
314:27 - record that is NS records okay and txt
314:30 - record is some kind of record that
314:32 - administered some kind of text and all
314:34 - these things okay now let's move to our
314:37 - main motive of this particular video
314:39 - that is the host command okay
314:42 - so I hope you got to learn about all
314:43 - those things about DNS records
314:46 - I hope it is visible to you let me just
314:48 - increase the size first so that it will
314:51 - be easy to
314:53 - it will be easily visible okay
314:56 - so now let's enter the host
314:58 - and just provide the google.com
315:02 - okay oh wait a minute
315:04 - [Music]
315:07 - okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind
315:09 - of error
315:15 - okay
315:16 - host
315:19 - google.com
315:22 - Okay
315:23 - google.com not found why like
315:27 - this
315:28 - post
315:31 - okay it's working
315:39 - okay let me provide another iPad another
315:42 - domain name like let me provide Gmail
315:48 - .com
315:52 - host gmail.com not found okay why this
315:55 - is happening I'm not getting
316:00 - let me do first thing whether it's
316:02 - working or not
316:04 - okay temporary failure in name
316:07 - resolution
316:09 - let me ping another some domain name
316:11 - that is a
316:13 - uh
316:15 - which two menu should I
316:19 - let me check here medium.com let me do
316:25 - medium.com
316:28 - why it's happening I'm not getting uh
316:30 - let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine
316:32 - so that
316:34 - after it may be uh work let me do
316:39 - okay now I've started restarting my PC
316:42 - uh let me now perform the that command
316:45 - okay so I hope it is visible to you uh
316:48 - let's do host google.com
316:54 - okay so here you can see the address of
316:56 - google.com that is uh that is the ipv4
316:59 - that is what does ipv4 address mean it
317:01 - means that it is a like 32-bit ideas I
317:04 - guess okay if I'm not wrong let me check
317:07 - why to create confusion for you guys
317:10 - okay
317:11 - IP address
317:13 - bit
317:15 - size okay I hope it is 32 yeah I was
317:18 - connected okay it's 32-bit address
317:21 - it ranges from 0 to 20 0 2 to double
317:24 - five
317:25 - okay so here you can see the IP
317:28 - addresses of google.com that is
317:31 - 172.217.27.2.6 and again with with same
317:34 - like you will get this IPv6 address so
317:36 - that this is the
317:38 - like version 6 addresses of google.com
317:40 - and the mail server address that is MTP
317:44 - now what will happen
317:45 - if you will think about the concept of
317:48 - DNS what is happening here is when you
317:51 - are entering google.com
317:53 - so that domain is mapped with this
317:56 - particular IP address this one
317:58 - let me copy this IP address and let me
318:03 - put it here what will happen whether it
318:06 - will go on to the google.com or not
318:08 - let's check
318:11 - foreign
318:14 - so here you can see that that IP address
318:17 - is mapped to the google.com that's why
318:20 - uh like we are going on this particular
318:24 - domain name
318:25 - what will happen if I will see I will
318:28 - just change it dot two zero six to two
318:30 - note five whether it will go to the same
318:32 - or different let's check
318:34 - okay it's going to the same
318:36 - because that per whole IP address may be
318:39 - belonging to that particular google.com
318:43 - let me do two double zero
318:46 - okay it's same okay so now uh let me go
318:50 - for some another domain also host uh
318:53 - let's go with medium.com
318:55 - like sometimes it happens like uh you
318:59 - can't go on a particular okay I press
319:02 - something like print okay
319:06 - when sometimes what happens when you
319:08 - enter the IP address of some of the
319:10 - domain name then at that time you will
319:12 - not be able to reach that particular
319:14 - domain because of firewall
319:16 - implementation and all so
319:19 - so here also you can see different IP
319:21 - addresses mail servers okay so let me
319:24 - check this one
319:25 - one five three Dot
319:28 - four
319:33 - okay let's check whether it goes or not
319:35 - okay so yeah here you can see the direct
319:37 - iPad is not allowed why because I think
319:40 - they are using cloudflare
319:43 - Cloud Player they are using yes
319:45 - your IP here I will get my IP address
319:48 - okay
319:50 - so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now
319:54 - moving forward in this particular video
319:56 - with the getting the DNS records of a
320:00 - particular domain name okay
320:02 - so how you can get it like uh using
320:05 - hyphen T option we can get and also if
320:09 - you want to get only the IPv6 address
320:11 - you can get if it is available
320:16 - so here you can see connection is
320:17 - refused
320:18 - now let's check with the CNM record okay
320:21 - so if you don't know more cname record
320:23 - you can go here and learn about it
320:26 - on this particular block okay
320:31 - domain to another domain for example you
320:34 - can see blog.example.com has a CNM
320:36 - record with a value of example.com This
320:39 - Means whenever DNS record hits the DNS
320:42 - record for blocked example it actually
320:44 - triggers another DNS lookup to which
320:47 - domain that is the example domain
320:50 - and it basically turns the IP of the
320:52 - same that is main domain name
320:54 - example.com domain okay
320:58 - so uh let's do the DNS look of all this
321:01 - particular record that is which one CNM
321:04 - record
321:05 - so the command is very simple host
321:07 - hyphen T C name and you have to just
321:10 - write any domain name which you want
321:12 - let's do with google.com
321:15 - okay it has no any record
321:18 - uh maybe it will be for medium
321:21 - let's check
321:23 - okay no records
321:26 - uh any website
321:31 - okay
321:33 - let me search for
321:36 - random
321:37 - colleges
321:40 - in Delhi
321:42 - if I get any college website now let's
321:45 - go with the siksha.com
321:55 - copy it
321:58 - and just paste it here
322:07 - okay so here we are getting the
322:11 - okay not found
322:13 - okay
322:16 - okay so these sites are not having any
322:18 - CM because let's go with some another
322:19 - record
322:21 - uh let me check with the MX record that
322:23 - is the mail action it should be there
322:25 - yeah it has a mixed record let's go for
322:29 - uh gold medium.com
322:34 - yeah they are using
322:37 - MX record okay and let's check for
322:40 - another record that is the txt record
322:45 - okay we are getting it here all those
322:47 - records
322:49 - uh let's check for
322:52 - okay another website that is structure
322:55 - hyphen ttxt record
323:00 - okay we are getting all those
323:02 - information whatever the
323:03 - actors stored in this particular text
323:06 - file in the DNS records okay
323:08 - so I hope you like this particular video
323:10 - and today we will stop here in the next
323:12 - video we will learn about something new
323:14 - okay so that's all for today's video and
323:16 - if you have any queries then please ask
323:17 - us in the comment section so thank you
323:19 - thank you for watching and we'll meet in
323:20 - the next video thank you
323:24 - hello guys now in this particular video
323:25 - we are going to cover the ifconfig
323:27 - command basically it stands for
323:28 - interface configurator okay basically in
323:31 - this particular video we will be doing
323:32 - like changing the IP addresses and all
323:35 - those things and also this Commander
323:36 - basically we use is to find the IP
323:38 - address and the MAC address of
323:39 - particular machine
323:40 - so before starting what is the MAC
323:42 - address so macad is nothing but a
323:43 - particular 48-bit address which we use
323:46 - to identify a particular device on a
323:48 - particular Network okay so basically
323:51 - this Mac address is printed on your Nic
323:54 - that is the Nic is the one of the card
323:56 - which attached to your to your computer
323:59 - or to your laptop then at this Mac
324:01 - address is like written hard coded okay
324:06 - so let's start with our video so I will
324:08 - just hit
324:09 - ifconfig so here you can see I'm getting
324:12 - different interfaces like enp03 and
324:15 - localhost and at this point of time I am
324:18 - getting this IP address this is provided
324:19 - by virtualbox
324:21 - and this is the IPv6 address and this is
324:25 - the my Mac address okay so don't worry
324:28 - I've changed it okay and this interface
324:31 - is for the localhost okay so uh
324:34 - basically this command provides us what
324:37 - information you can see here the ipv4
324:39 - address ipvc and the
324:42 - Mac address okay
324:44 - so moving forward uh if you want to get
324:47 - the information of particular interface
324:48 - how you can do it
324:50 - if config and just write the interface
324:52 - name that is enp 0s3
324:55 - okay here you can see the only uh like
324:58 - information about a single interface
325:00 - okay what is the interface just like uh
325:02 - suppose if you are connected to a VPN
325:05 - then another interface will be created
325:07 - okay so it just provides us the IP
325:09 - address of a particular Network in which
325:11 - through to which you are connected and
325:13 - on
325:15 - okay so moving forward uh if you want to
325:17 - change your IP address how you can do it
325:19 - so this command basically provides us
325:22 - this functionality also another command
325:24 - is IP Command which we will cover in our
325:26 - next video okay which which is similarly
325:29 - used for these purposes so first let's
325:32 - uh
325:33 - change the IP address of this particular
325:35 - command that is ifconfig and the
325:38 - interface name but before I will need to
325:40 - copy this interface name
325:43 - okay so let me clear the screen if
325:46 - config
325:49 - ifconfig
325:52 - interface name and then the I will
325:55 - provide one IP address let's do 192.168.
326:00 - uh Dot
326:05 - 255.0 and net marks we will provide
326:09 - like this determines the number of our
326:13 - machines which will be there on the
326:15 - network okay the operation permitted why
326:16 - because we have not used sudo so to
326:19 - change these uh things we we need a
326:22 - pseudo permission okay
326:23 - I will enter just password
326:27 - I hope I tied wrong password yeah
326:32 - No it should
326:34 - okay let me try it again
326:38 - yeah done now again I will check the IP
326:41 - address I if config
326:43 - and I'm here you can see the particular
326:45 - IP addresses and netbox okay so that's
326:48 - all for this particular video and we'll
326:49 - meet in the next video with another most
326:50 - amazing command so if you have any query
326:52 - then please ask in the comment section
326:53 - guys so thank you and thank you for
326:55 - watching we'll meet in the next one
326:58 - hello guys now in this particular video
326:59 - we are going to learn about the IP
327:01 - Command okay so this is similar to the
327:03 - ipconfig ifconfig command okay so in
327:07 - this particular video we are going to
327:08 - learn about this so let me open up the
327:10 - terminal and
327:13 - let me just increase the font size okay
327:15 - I hope it is visible to you
327:18 - and the command is just IP and you have
327:20 - to provide just one option that is a or
327:22 - a this one double TR okay so this will
327:25 - give you the IP addresses of for each
327:28 - interface so that is this is a local
327:30 - host and second one is my this one
327:32 - interface en p 0 S3
327:35 - and my Mac address is there which is
327:37 - provided by the
327:39 - which what we say virtual box and this
327:42 - one is the IP address okay
327:44 - so uh
327:46 - now moving forward uh if you want to get
327:49 - the on the ipv4 address so what can you
327:52 - type okay
327:53 - so IP 5.4
327:57 - and just awdr and here you go and now
328:02 - you have got the only ipv4 addresses not
328:05 - IPv6 but what if you want to get the ipv
328:08 - IPv6 address then what command you can
328:10 - do IB iPhone 6.
328:14 - address okay so here you can see this is
328:17 - the uh IPv6 it is the it means IP
328:21 - version 6 address okay so basically
328:23 - there are the two types of addresses
328:24 - that is a IP version 4 and version 6 and
328:27 - there are some differences between them
328:29 - uh like um uh differences in you can say
328:34 - on basis of bit size okay you can learn
328:37 - more about the differences between ipv4
328:39 - and IPv6
328:41 - and moving forward uh let me tell you
328:44 - about one more uh this option that is a
328:48 - IP address so Dev and interface if you
328:52 - want to get only information about some
328:54 - particular input interface so I will go
328:57 - with this enp 0s3
329:01 - and here you can see the only result
329:04 - from this interface particular e and P0
329:08 - S3 let me clear the screen so that it
329:11 - will be
329:13 - more visible to you let me again run the
329:16 - command okay here you can see the
329:18 - interface is this one
329:20 - and here is the MAC address and the IP
329:23 - address okay so in this way you can get
329:26 - the IP address and Mac address of your
329:28 - system using this IP Command okay if you
329:31 - want to learn more you can just do man
329:33 - IP
329:35 - and here we will get the multiple
329:36 - options as you can see here hyphen H for
329:40 - human readable for iPhone S for stats so
329:43 - I'll put more information if the cap
329:45 - option appears twice on the amount of
329:47 - information increases okay
329:49 - so let me try hyphen as IP hyphen is
329:54 - let's see what happens okay
329:56 - uh
329:57 - uh what should I do now
330:01 - object equal to address
330:03 - okay
330:04 - let me check like this
330:08 - yeah here you can see we are getting now
330:11 - various records like many more
330:13 - information
330:15 - okay this is rx bytes packet and a drop
330:17 - missed any packet which is Mr M cast so
330:21 - all these are showing here
330:23 - okay you get this option you can get
330:25 - more information
330:27 - again let's see some another option
330:29 - which we can use here like
330:34 - if you let's use hyphen r
330:38 - IP hyphen our address
330:41 - okay so here you can see the information
330:43 - about dissolver name
330:47 - 6 is virtualbox 64 scoping this is
330:51 - okay so that's all for today's video
330:54 - guys I hope you liked it and if you have
330:56 - any query then please ask us in the
330:57 - comment section okay so thank you thank
330:59 - you for watching and we'll meet in the
331:01 - next video thank you
331:04 - now in this particular video we are
331:06 - going to learn about the who is command
331:07 - okay so basically this is the command
331:09 - line utility of one of the GUI based
331:11 - tool that is a who is lookup okay so
331:14 - basically we use this particular command
331:16 - to find the information about a
331:18 - particular domain name as for example
331:20 - google.com
331:22 - or the IP address
331:25 - okay
331:26 - so this is the basically command which
331:29 - we will use and let's see what kind of
331:31 - information we can get about one
331:33 - particular domain name or particular IP
331:36 - address okay
331:37 - so first of all let me find the IP
331:39 - address of google.com
331:41 - okay so here I'm getting this one I will
331:43 - just copy it how I can do it just Ctrl
331:47 - shift and C
331:48 - I will just now hit Ctrl C to
331:53 - to stop this ping command okay now who
331:56 - is okay so now you will see this command
331:59 - is not found why not found because it's
332:02 - not installed in our system that so it's
332:03 - not found okay so just copy it okay
332:08 - paste it this is the APT install which
332:11 - this is a command to install any package
332:12 - you want
332:15 - okay let it install
332:19 - okay done done yeah
332:23 - okay I think now it's done it will take
332:27 - some time this way okay now done
332:30 - let me clear the screen let me again
332:31 - type who is okay yeah uh yeah I can do
332:34 - like
332:36 - I am able to learn to run this command
332:38 - okay now
332:39 - so here you can see there are many flags
332:41 - available to use this command that is a
332:44 - host Port I for query who is INR and
332:48 - follows its referral okay
332:51 - so now what we will do let's hit this
332:55 - one who is and first let's check for DNS
332:57 - only like for domain names okay
333:00 - so now here you can see multiple
333:02 - information about this domain google.com
333:04 - let me clear this screen and again let
333:07 - me show you the whole
333:09 - information about google.com
333:12 - so here you can see the domain name is
333:15 - google.com their ID is this who which
333:18 - server is this their URL is this like
333:22 - from where they have registered or what
333:24 - register URL
333:26 - and updated date you can see it's 9 9
333:29 - 2019 expiry date is 49.28
333:33 - okay so name server is this one
333:36 - ns1.google.com minus two and so on
333:40 - and moving forward
333:42 - and here you can see the
333:45 - creation date all those things okay
333:49 - and admin organization who is the admin
333:52 - of this particular domain that is Google
333:54 - llc's the admin as we all know
333:57 - country us yeah we know it
334:00 - and sometimes we don't get this email
334:02 - because suppose you buy a domain name
334:05 - from godaddy.com okay so they take some
334:08 - some fees to you to keep your
334:10 - information safe
334:12 - okay so no one should access those
334:15 - information like your mail ID your
334:17 - password not password your phone number
334:19 - and all those things
334:21 - okay so in this way you can get the
334:24 - information about uh
334:27 - any particular domain name okay now let
334:29 - me again check with uh
334:32 - with the IP address whether I'm able to
334:35 - perform this not let me just copy this
334:37 - IP address again
334:38 - oh wait okay yeah
334:41 - 142.250
334:44 - okay let me clear the screen
334:48 - who is and the particular IP address and
334:50 - we are done okay so here's the all the
334:53 - results
334:54 - so net range is this 142.250 dot not DOT
334:58 - not to this range okay so IP addresses
335:01 - can be between this Eid ad is this slash
335:03 - 15 so if you want to learn more about
335:06 - the idea I have actually uh write a blog
335:09 - on it you can search for it like
335:11 - subnetting infosec write-ups if you will
335:13 - search then you will get okay
335:15 - then Google parent all this information
335:18 - you can get okay
335:21 - so basically where you will think about
335:23 - where uh you need this particular
335:25 - command what is the use of this
335:27 - basically if you go in the testing field
335:29 - or penetration testing or cyber security
335:30 - field and then there is a phase of
335:33 - information gathering so in this
335:35 - particular phase we use it okay so
335:37 - that's why I'm telling you
335:39 - okay so uh
335:41 - let me search for some more information
335:44 - like who is what are the things we can
335:48 - check here who is
335:50 - hyphen Q keyword description okay
335:57 - okay if you will use hyphen it will
336:00 - search for all the mirror databases
336:03 - b5p addresses with abuse contact okay
336:07 - show the email addresses
336:10 - okay uh let me try with hyphen B okay
336:14 - let's check what happens
336:16 - who is hyphen B google.com
336:22 - okay here you can see we are getting
336:24 - some kind of
336:26 - email address okay let me again uh
336:31 - like uh use this command and I will not
336:33 - use hyphen B option so so that we can uh
336:37 - get the difference okay
336:39 - so what was the command I had entered
336:40 - here
336:42 - who is hyphen B okay now I will just use
336:45 - who is
336:46 - google.com
336:50 - Okay so
336:54 - here you can see uh I think we are not
336:57 - getting any uh mail address here but
336:59 - here you can see
337:00 - admin email
337:02 - okay but here I am getting one address
337:05 - that is brjb someone's address it is
337:09 - okay
337:12 - so in this way uh you can use different
337:14 - options okay so that's all for today's
337:17 - video I hope you liked it and if you
337:19 - have any queries then please ask us in
337:21 - the comment section we will surely help
337:22 - you and thank you thank you for watching
337:25 - and we'll meet in the next video thank
337:27 - you thank you so much
337:29 - in this particular video we are going to
337:31 - learn about the nslookup command okay so
337:33 - basically this command is used to find
337:35 - uh like information about the DNS
337:38 - records Okay so
337:40 - previously in the host command we have
337:42 - find the DNS record so and already we
337:44 - have covered what is the domain name
337:45 - server like it is used to change the
337:48 - domain name to the IP address and vice
337:50 - versa and also various DNS records like
337:53 - cname record we have covered and txt
337:57 - record
337:58 - a record and for a record we have
338:02 - covered okay so many records we have
338:04 - covered till now and we will use this NS
338:06 - logo command to get information about
338:09 - these particular records
338:11 - okay so let's start with the first basic
338:13 - one
338:15 - start with google.com
338:19 - okay let me close this caps lock okay
338:22 - let's look up google.com
338:24 - okay done here you can see the address
338:27 - that is this is ipv4 address and this is
338:29 - IPv6 address okay so uh you can like
338:34 - what we say use this
338:37 - like this also you can use NS look of
338:40 - hyphen type equal to it means you are
338:42 - just defining the what type of record
338:44 - you want okay it may be a record okay
338:47 - let's search for area code iPhone type A
338:49 - and just provide the
338:52 - domain name and here you will get the
338:54 - address
338:55 - okay so in this you are getting this let
338:57 - me search for another domain name let's
338:59 - take some another domain name what
339:02 - should we take
339:04 - uh I'm not getting
339:06 - okay facebook.com
339:10 - okay so here you can see this is the
339:12 - particular IP address of facebook.com
339:15 - and this is for google.com
339:18 - so let me uh just copy this
339:22 - IP address and paste it in the browser
339:25 - whether we can access it or not
339:29 - let me just paste it here
339:32 - okay I think I'm not copied it
339:37 - okay just copy it
339:41 - and um we'll just open up the
339:46 - okay here I will paste it let's say
339:48 - whether it is accessible or not
339:51 - google.com with this iPad is okay so it
339:53 - is accessible
339:54 - and similarly we will try for our this
339:58 - one
340:01 - facebook.com I don't think it will be
340:03 - accessible
340:05 - let's still let's try
340:13 - okay it's showing not recommended
340:17 - I will accept a risk let's say what
340:20 - happens
340:22 - is
340:25 - I hope you have watched a scam
340:28 - okay so here you can see uh we are on
340:32 - this facebook.com page okay it means we
340:35 - can uh go on this particular page using
340:39 - IP address
340:41 - okay so moving forward uh if you want to
340:44 - get the record of like 4A record like a
340:48 - a a a and a okay I hope I
340:52 - count it till five
340:57 - okay
340:58 - so here you can see the
341:01 - version 6 like IPv6 address of
341:04 - facebook.com now let's try some another
341:07 - record for another domain uh let me
341:09 - check for a record for some other
341:12 - another another domain like I will now I
341:14 - will go for YouTube
341:18 - okay here you can see the iPad is of
341:20 - YouTube I we know it may be accessible
341:23 - or not accessible using IP address okay
341:25 - that particular domain so now moving
341:28 - forward to the different records so we
341:30 - will search for the uh
341:33 - txt record
341:35 - okay let's search for txt
341:37 - iPhone type equal to txt youtube.com
341:41 - Okay so here you can see this is the
341:44 - Google side verification some kind of
341:45 - text is stored
341:48 - okay and uh
341:51 - if I go with some different domain name
341:53 - like
341:54 - Facebook
341:57 - okay let's check okay
342:00 - these are the texts
342:04 - okay let's check for some another domain
342:06 - also
342:08 - I will just check for google.com
342:12 - okay here you can see different
342:14 - different uh like many texts are present
342:18 - there
342:19 - atlassian
342:22 - One Touch domain verification okay many
342:24 - things are there
342:25 - and now moving forward let's check for
342:28 - the MX record that is the mail exchange
342:30 - record okay it it is basically we use it
342:33 - to like sending the mail or receiving
342:35 - the mail from
342:37 - from any sender okay
342:41 - so let's use it I will just change this
342:46 - from type to MX
342:49 - and this is you can see the mail
342:51 - exchange which is smtp.google.com okay
342:54 - we have used this command like for like
342:56 - big giant so why not to use these
342:59 - command photos small uh
343:01 - websites like let's take some let me
343:04 - search it search it for
343:06 - uh
343:08 - I will open up Chrome here
343:11 - I think into this Firefox will take much
343:14 - time in this
343:17 - okay we are here
343:20 - just search for Linux commands
343:25 - okay so let me take Java T Point okay
343:30 - um yeah
343:33 - let me close this okay now I will use
343:37 - Java T point a record
343:43 - Java t point.com
343:46 - okay so here you can see this is the a
343:49 - record
343:50 - and here you can see true IP addresses
343:52 - are pointing to the same domain uh let
343:55 - me check I will just copy this IP
343:57 - address
343:59 - and I will put it in my
344:03 - browser let's check what happens whether
344:05 - it is accessible or not I don't know why
344:08 - it's not working off
344:11 - bi-directional copy paste is not here I
344:14 - think let me enable those settings yeah
344:17 - I think now it should work
344:20 - Ctrl FC
344:23 - oh yeah now it's working okay so here
344:26 - you can see uh direct ipx is not allowed
344:29 - for Java Point let me check the another
344:31 - IP address
344:33 - it will be it will throw same error I
344:37 - think let's see what happens
344:39 - okay same same thing like direct IP
344:41 - access is not allowed so I hope you got
344:44 - it how you can find the different
344:45 - records using an X lookup command so
344:47 - that's it for today's video and we'll
344:48 - meet in the next video so with some
344:50 - amazing commands so thank you thank you
344:51 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
344:53 - one thank you particular video we are
344:55 - going to learn about the most
344:56 - interesting command that is a double
344:57 - gate command okay so basically we use
344:59 - this command to uh download files from
345:02 - the servers or from any website suppose
345:04 - in case if you want to download any kind
345:06 - of PNG or you want to download any kind
345:09 - of PDF or you can say uh
345:13 - also if you want to mirror the website
345:16 - it means you want to download the whole
345:18 - website their whole file that is htmlc
345:20 - is a JavaScript all those well if you
345:22 - want to download okay so in this case
345:24 - you can do all those operations using
345:26 - this single command that is a double get
345:28 - command okay
345:30 - so uh let's start now with the
345:32 - implementation part that is uh W get
345:35 - and the
345:37 - whatever the URL you want okay I'm just
345:39 - first I will give you the syntax so
345:42 - syntax is nothing but W gate options and
345:45 - whatever the URL uh you want to provide
345:48 - it can be uh URL of any file or anything
345:50 - else okay
345:52 - so now moving forward uh what are the
345:55 - protocols that wget command supports so
345:57 - it supports http
346:00 - https that is a high for text transfer
346:02 - protocol secure
346:05 - and FTP file transfer protocol so these
346:08 - are the some protocols which are used by
346:09 - the duplicate command so HTTP runs on
346:12 - Port 80 https runs on Port 443 and FTP
346:15 - on Port 21.
346:17 - okay now moving forward uh let me
346:20 - increase the font size first so that it
346:22 - should it should be visible to you guys
346:24 - okay now now what I will do I will try
346:27 - to search for image
346:29 - I have already searched I think okay
346:33 - so Linux PNG
346:38 - let me copy this image address or
346:43 - let me do here also I will choose
346:48 - this one image okay let's check
346:50 - let me check open image in new tribe
346:54 - okay
346:58 - um
347:00 - yeah this one is good
347:02 - copy image address
347:05 - and here the blue gate and the oh my god
347:09 - let's let's see what happens let's see
347:11 - just
347:14 - file name is too long okay
347:17 - so let's take some another image uh
347:22 - okay let me search for
347:27 - from here I will choose okay
347:37 - okay
347:42 - I think this one should be no not this
347:46 - one
347:50 - open image in new tab
347:54 - okay
347:56 - copy image address
347:59 - and now let's check
348:01 - so here right now I'm not providing any
348:03 - kind of options so it will just store my
348:05 - file in this current working directory
348:07 - but before I will just create a one
348:09 - directly W get tutorial I will create
348:11 - okay
348:13 - I will move into that particular
348:14 - directory and I will again enter the
348:16 - command that is W get and the this one
348:19 - link
348:21 - so here you can see it is downloading my
348:23 - file okay now I will do LS and here you
348:25 - can see my file has been downloaded okay
348:28 - now to uh see the image file uh there is
348:31 - a separate command that is a fee but it
348:35 - is you need to install first you can do
348:37 - like sudo apt
348:39 - install fee
348:41 - I know I don't know the pronunciation of
348:43 - this command but it can it could be
348:45 - something like that so as you can see
348:48 - phase already newest version so now what
348:49 - I will do I will just say and the file
348:52 - name what it was I think L something
348:54 - yeah
348:55 - so you can see file has been downloaded
348:57 - okay cool now you can easily download
348:59 - the files uh it can be used in some kind
349:02 - of automation things okay if you want
349:05 - but manually we download files from our
349:07 - web web browser but in some cases we
349:10 - could we can use duplicate command also
349:14 - so now moving forward uh we will uh
349:18 - see the uh like uh what like here you
349:22 - can see uh the name of the file is so
349:24 - big
349:25 - okay if you want to uh like name it some
349:29 - different names okay I will then for
349:31 - that we use capital O that is hyphen
349:34 - capital O option
349:36 - and then we will use the new name that I
349:38 - will provide this Linux PNG image
349:42 - okay and the URL
349:47 - let's check
349:49 - okay I will do LS and here you can see
349:51 - Linux PNG image I have not added dot PNG
349:55 - let me add it first
349:58 - okay
350:02 - dot PNG oh sorry sorry sorry sorry
350:11 - PNG
350:13 - done
350:17 - okay let me do LS and now I will use Fey
350:21 - Linux PNG not this one
350:24 - Linux image
350:27 - Linux what is the name it is Linux PNG
350:31 - image yeah okay so here you can see uh
350:35 - we have changed the name of the uh like
350:38 - file
350:39 - this so this like earlier it was a long
350:42 - string like the next pen doing Vector
350:44 - graphic pixel B
350:46 - all those things but now we can easily
350:49 - change the name of that particular file
350:52 - okay
350:55 - so moving forward uh you can use the
350:57 - different options like hyphen P option
351:00 - to uh like save the file in a particular
351:03 - directory in which you want so I will go
351:06 - just move back one directory and uh
351:10 - no let me
351:12 - PWD I will do and I will just copy the
351:15 - whole path here first
351:17 - okay if I'm not copy uh doesn't matter
351:20 - let's now I am in which directory I'm in
351:23 - this home I use directory okay now what
351:25 - I will do I will just like I want to
351:30 - CMI file in this particular directory
351:33 - okay but before that I will just remove
351:36 - those files
351:39 - uh
351:42 - edw get
351:45 - RM iPhone audio star
351:48 - okay
351:49 - it's not destroy it's basically as trick
351:51 - we say
351:52 - let me close this terminal
351:55 - now what you want to do you have to just
351:57 - to give the whole path of this
351:58 - particular
352:00 - like location
352:02 - so I will just provide this
352:05 - hyphen p and this one and we
352:11 - link so I will just copy this one link
352:15 - okay done it should be
352:20 - yes so now I will move back into this
352:23 - directory W get I'll do LS and here you
352:26 - can see the same image okay we have
352:29 - downloaded so using hyphen P option you
352:32 - can
352:33 - save your file into some another
352:36 - directory okay
352:39 - so now moving forward uh Suppose there
352:43 - is some conditions like if you are
352:44 - downloading multiple files or anything
352:47 - else and you have a limited bandwidth or
352:49 - limited internet connection or you can
352:51 - say limited net you have like these days
352:54 - we use 1.5 GB per days and all those
352:56 - things
352:57 - so in this case you want to limit your
353:00 - bandwidth or Internet like two like we
353:03 - we don't want to like w get to consume
353:06 - more amount of net
353:08 - okay
353:09 - so for this we use the uh hyphen hyphen
353:12 - limit hyphen rate option and we provide
353:15 - the what should be the minimum amount of
353:17 - the net
353:18 - used by this
353:22 - delegate command so for this what we
353:24 - will do get hyphen iPhone limit hyphen
353:28 - rate equal to one M1 I means one memory
353:31 - 1 MB and K means KB and all okay and the
353:36 - URL we will provide unless now or just
353:39 - uh
353:40 - use some different uh
353:43 - image
353:45 - oh not this one here this one I was
353:47 - learning what how I can see the image
353:49 - okay and this is not necessary
353:52 - okay
353:55 - move back move back uh
353:59 - let's download Spiderman
354:06 - Spiderman okay so this one is so like
354:12 - it's great image
354:14 - looking beautiful
354:16 - uh copy image address if I will do like
354:20 - it's on Splash image
354:23 - uh no I don't want this link let me open
354:27 - up this one
354:33 - open image a new tab
354:38 - okay
354:43 - uh if I will click on download free
354:47 - whether I will get some link or not if I
354:50 - will copy this one let's see what
354:52 - happens
354:54 - okay it's downloading now it means we
354:56 - have copied the
354:59 - correct link now what I will do I will
355:01 - just to paste the URL
355:04 - and we are done and also I will provide
355:07 - the iPhone option
355:09 - to change the file name
355:11 - iPhone capital O
355:15 - file name should be Spiderman
355:19 - dot PNG enter
355:24 - okay I'm getting some kind of error
355:29 - let me to Ctrl C LS
355:34 - something cat of look at log let's see
355:37 - what's going on
355:41 - okay saving spiderman.png okay
355:46 - let me again run the program
355:49 - uh you can use hyphen C option to uh
355:51 - what we can say to resume
355:55 - uh hyphen C I think it's uh
356:00 - ah small C let me check and again I will
356:03 - just
356:04 - open up some another terminal to check
356:07 - the W get lock file if I get the same
356:10 - error again
356:12 - CDW get URL LS
356:15 - and Trail hyphen f w get log okay
356:20 - and let me just again run this command
356:25 - okay
356:30 - redirecting output to W get hyphen log.1
356:38 - okay let me just Ctrl C and
356:41 - W get one it is I think
356:44 - LS uh
356:50 - one okay
356:52 - connecting to onesplash.com so here you
356:56 - can see we can see the live uh whatever
356:58 - the background process is going on you
357:00 - we can see this like this using tail
357:03 - command okay
357:04 - so w get comma and W get log basically
357:06 - provides the log okay
357:08 - whatever it's going on
357:12 - okay so I don't think it is getting
357:15 - connected I'm getting some kind of error
357:17 - maybe it could be network error let me
357:19 - just
357:20 - close the connection
357:22 - I will use some different uh
357:26 - different image not from months plus
357:29 - okay Wikipedia is there let me open
357:33 - image in new tab
357:34 - I need a short link just
357:38 - okay just search for Linux only
357:42 - okay and this one let me check
357:49 - let me close all these sites
358:02 - okay let's move back I think it's taking
358:05 - so much time
358:08 - Open Image new tab
358:11 - no
358:16 - Linux PNG
358:27 - oh here it's still opening man how much
358:30 - time it will take
358:32 - uh let me pause the video uh
358:37 - okay so I was getting a network error at
358:39 - that time uh now it has been resolved so
358:42 - here you can see uh like the log file of
358:45 - this one W get DOT log dot one okay so
358:48 - you can see the file is already fully
358:50 - retrieved okay so uh now I will just
358:54 - check again so here you can see the
358:56 - image I think it's too large to display
358:58 - here
358:59 - okay that's why we are not uh able to
359:01 - see it
359:02 - so in this case if you want to limit
359:05 - your bandwidth you can use the limit
359:07 - hyphen hyphen uh hyphen iPhone limit
359:09 - hyphen rate equal to whatever the uh
359:12 - amount you want to give like uh it could
359:15 - be 1 MB 1 KB or anything it's all
359:17 - depends upon you and your internet
359:19 - connection
359:21 - similarly using hyphen C we just checked
359:24 - we can resume any uh like uh
359:27 - any download which is not complete or if
359:30 - like similarly I just got the network
359:32 - error so I can resume using iPhone C
359:35 - option
359:37 - okay now moving forward uh if you want
359:40 - to download some file in the background
359:42 - process
359:44 - okay so in that time we use the hyphen B
359:47 - option that is this one hyphen B option
359:49 - we will use and also the W get log file
359:53 - will be created similarly like this like
359:56 - this one W get log and W get log.1 okay
360:00 - similarly this file will be generated
360:02 - and we can see the whatever the process
360:04 - going on and all those things
360:07 - so now moving forward I will just
360:09 - download one PDF I will just search for
360:11 - us
360:12 - uh
360:14 - file type this is Linux Google docking
360:17 - we call it if you use this kind of
360:19 - searches
360:20 - file type I will just type uh
360:26 - um let's type linux.pdf
360:30 - I hope my connection internet should
360:33 - work okay again I'm getting a ride on to
360:35 - let me pause the video
360:37 - okay now I'm done I'll now finally it's
360:40 - working let me just search for uh file
360:43 - type
360:45 - I will just use let's just search
360:48 - similarly like this file type PDF
360:51 - uh colonizers let me write the file name
360:54 - also so that it could be easy
360:57 - so here you can see there is one PDF
360:59 - file introduction to Linux this one okay
361:03 - tldp.org this is some kind of
361:06 - I don't know which website is I will
361:07 - just copy this one
361:10 - move back to our terminal just LS remove
361:13 - everything whatever we have uh
361:15 - downloaded till now okay RM iPhone RF
361:18 - forcefully we removed everything clear
361:20 - the screen also W get hyphen B and the
361:24 - particular
361:27 - link or URL you can say so now in this
361:30 - case what will happen the log file will
361:31 - be created okay so I will just enter and
361:35 - what it's saying continuing in
361:37 - background PID is this output will be
361:39 - written to W get hyphen log
361:41 - okay LS I will just use tail hyphen f w
361:46 - kit and here you can see all done we
361:50 - have finally downloaded this one I think
361:52 - let me do LS
361:54 - and
361:56 - let me go into the file section
362:00 - file system open

365:04 - okay so now in the next video we will
365:07 - see the the most interesting part of
365:10 - this wget command which will be covered
365:12 - in our next videos so till now we will
365:14 - stop here and thank you thank you for
365:16 - watching and if you have any questions
365:17 - please ask us in the comment section
365:19 - guys thank you thank you for watching
365:20 - and we'll meet in the next one
365:23 - hello is now in this particular video we
365:25 - are going to learn about the how we can
365:27 - mirror a particular website or download
365:28 - a particular website you can select that
365:30 - also so using W get command so already
365:33 - we have covered the first part of wget
365:35 - command and now in this particular video
365:36 - we will just mirror the website okay
365:39 - so what are the things we will be doing
365:41 - in this particular video so first of all
365:43 - we will meter the website and secondly
365:46 - we will just locally host the website
365:47 - using python
365:49 - okay and already the python installed in
365:51 - our one to PC okay
365:53 - this machine so these are the two things
365:55 - we will perform and let's start the
365:58 - implementation part so we will use this
366:00 - wget command and some of the options the
366:03 - common option is use hyphen am but it is
366:06 - not suitable to browse that downloaded
366:08 - website locally so additionally we use
366:10 - some other options that is hyphen K and
366:13 - hyphen P option also to browse those
366:17 - website locally in an easy way okay and
366:19 - it downloads the website in a particular
366:21 - format you can select that
366:23 - okay
366:24 - so I have already selected this
366:26 - particular website you can see this is a
366:29 - quite a good website and this is nothing
366:31 - but a free template from I've got this
366:34 - from this html.design slash demo slash
366:38 - bird uh bird IM okay
366:41 - so you can do this you can also download
366:44 - this template or also any other okay
366:48 - so I'll just copy the URL and I will
366:51 - just paste it here
366:53 - and but before that uh
366:57 - well wait a minute I'll just close it I
367:01 - will just create One Directory uh mirror
367:04 - website
367:06 - okay CD mirror website
367:11 - okay and now here I will use those
367:14 - particular
367:16 - this one command okay
367:18 - so now it will fetch all the HTML Pages
367:21 - CSS all the images it is fetching and
367:24 - here you can see contact dot HTML images
367:27 - bird lion dear dog anything whatever is
367:30 - the images and all those things it is
367:32 - fetching
367:33 - so it will take approx I think it should
367:37 - take three to four minutes of time as
367:41 - website is not quite uh long like
367:46 - it should not take much time
367:50 - okay so here you can see it has faced
367:52 - multiple files you can see multiple
367:54 - images of images directory
367:58 - and here you can see it is fetching left
368:01 - Arrow blue all those images it is
368:03 - fetching
368:05 - okay
368:07 - xmlrpc dot PHP okay it's present here in
368:11 - this particular website I think this is

377:34 - next one thank you thank you so much
377:37 - particular video we are going to learn
377:39 - about the SSH command okay so basically
377:41 - this command we use to connect to the
377:43 - remote machines or if you are not aware
377:46 - of remote machine then let me tell you
377:48 - first what is the remote machine so
377:49 - basically this is the concept of cloud
377:51 - computing in which
377:53 - uh when you use a machine this is just
377:56 - like a similar machine but we access it
377:58 - remotely okay that will be the similar
378:01 - machine like your PC and the same
378:03 - operating system will be there okay and
378:06 - it will be Linux or it can be
378:09 - Windows OS okay so basically that
378:12 - particular instance or that particular
378:15 - machine is stored in the data center of
378:17 - different Cloud providers if you are
378:19 - using AWS then Amazon Amazon data center
378:22 - will be there if you are using Azure
378:25 - then Microsoft cloud data center will be
378:28 - there and in case of Google then Google
378:30 - data center will be there okay so
378:34 - basically what we are going to perform
378:36 - in this particular video so first of all
378:39 - I will create a virtual machine in Azure
378:41 - you can also do it because it's a free
378:43 - and using sandbox so you can like
378:47 - you get one hour excess of the Azure
378:49 - portal so you can go on this particular
378:52 - link or you can just search for create a
378:54 - VM using Azure portal then you will get
378:56 - this link and you will just need to
378:58 - login using your Microsoft account
379:00 - so I'll just activate sandbox it will
379:02 - take some time just wait for it
379:06 - okay but uh let me tell you first like
379:09 - SSH command so what port it uses so
379:13 - basically SSS command uses port number
379:15 - 22 okay
379:18 - so now this processes uh going on and in
379:22 - this particular this article you can
379:24 - learn about how you can create a virtual
379:26 - machine also if you are interested okay
379:34 - so now 91 92
379:38 - yeah
379:39 - okay and you have to just to go there
379:42 - and click on this as your portal
379:47 - okay
379:52 - okay now here this here is the Azure
379:54 - portal you can easily uh create virtual
379:57 - machines in this just click on this
379:59 - virtual machine
380:00 - okay so I will just click on it
380:04 - and you have to just click on create
380:09 - as your virtual machine
380:14 - okay so here you can see the resource
380:17 - code you have to select just this learn
380:18 - and virtual machine name I will just use
380:21 - a Linux VM
380:23 - and this is the Ubuntu Server we are
380:25 - going to use in our case this is a image
380:28 - it means which operating system you are
380:30 - going to use so here you can see choose
380:31 - the base operating system or applicator
380:33 - applicable for the VM so we are all
380:36 - ready to selected there is Ubuntu server
380:39 - you can also select different OS like
380:41 - Windows and all for Windows we use RDP
380:44 - okay
380:45 - so now here you can see if you are going
380:47 - with this sh public key then it will
380:49 - create a DOT pem file but right now we
380:52 - are not going with it we are going uh
380:54 - it's a simple way that is a password so
380:57 - I will just provide a password that is
380:59 - ayush and I will provide a username
381:05 - okay
381:11 - okay matching now SSH Port is there you
381:14 - can enable HTTP also it's so all your

387:29 - you will think like this is my Ubuntu
387:31 - machine okay
387:32 - so Apache 2 is getting okay okay
387:36 - uh after uh creating the server you will
387:39 - see the default page of Apache
387:43 - okay we are done and I will just reload
387:46 - okay so automatically here you can see
387:48 - the Apache server uh default page is
387:52 - displaying okay
387:54 - so uh let me change this uh like I will
387:57 - just change the permission of one folder
388:00 - that is
388:02 - 7 7
388:05 - and the folder is war www
388:10 - HTML basically this is the directory
388:12 - where your index.str file is stored
388:16 - I'll do sudo now okay
388:19 - and now let's move back into those
388:22 - directories I will just use CD dot dot
388:26 - slash
388:27 - unless
388:29 - again CD dot dot slash LS I will move
388:34 - into the war
388:35 - www.html
388:40 - okay now we'll do LS here you will see
388:43 - there is nothing I will just create
388:48 - index.html and I will okay permission
388:51 - denied I will use sudo
388:55 - okay again it's permission is denied
388:57 - okay unless iPhone l
389:02 - CH mode seven seven
389:08 - operation not permitted let's use sudo
389:13 - okay now I can edit this index.html file
389:17 - okay I will use this body
389:20 - and the H1 tag I will use this is
389:28 - tutorial base Stone SSH by
389:37 - ayush
389:40 - okay and just close this body tag Ctrl D
389:46 - to save and just reload this page
389:51 - okay so you're done here you can see
389:54 - this is tutorial based on SSH by iOS so
389:57 - I hope you uh got to learn about
389:59 - different things in this particular
390:01 - video like how you can create VMS in
390:04 - Azure Azure okay
390:07 - and also how you can
390:10 - install Apache server in your remote
390:13 - machine and the most important thing SSH
390:15 - command how you can connect
390:17 - so in our next video we will use
390:19 - different commands to we will see how we
390:22 - can upload files from our like this
390:25 - local machine to this machine but sorry
390:34 - but we will use uh like different server
390:38 - okay like tomorrow we will use ec2
390:41 - server of Amazon okay because uh this
390:45 - machine will get uh like out of network
390:49 - in one hour okay not in even one hour it
390:53 - will take
390:55 - approx 35 minutes will be remaining okay
390:58 - 42 minutes okay
391:00 - thank you guys for watching this video
391:02 - and I hope you liked it and got to learn
391:04 - about new things so we will meet in the
391:06 - next video so bye bye and we'll meet you
391:09 - next one thank you for watching
391:10 - hello guys now in this particular video
391:12 - we're going to learn about the SCP
391:13 - command okay so basically this command
391:15 - is used to copy the files from one host
391:17 - to the another host that is uh in our
391:20 - previous video we had created the
391:22 - virtual machine and uh
391:24 - today we will work on that particular
391:26 - thing
391:27 - so basically in this video we will
391:28 - create one virtual machine and we will
391:30 - share the file or move file from this
391:33 - machine from this Ubuntu machine to that
391:36 - particular remote machine okay so we
391:38 - will do this with the SCP command so
391:41 - let's start the video on first of all we
391:43 - will need to create a virtual machine
391:46 - so on this particular URL you can go
391:48 - like learn microsoft.com and intro to
391:52 - Azure virtual machine then you here you
391:54 - will get the sandbox and you will get
391:56 - the access of one hour of azure portal
391:59 - so you don't need to pay any amount of
392:01 - money for creating virtual machine or
392:03 - anything okay
392:05 - so we will wait for some time uh it will
392:08 - just take hardly 10 seconds now
392:12 - okay let's wait
392:18 - 92 93 4
392:21 - okay hundred
392:23 - okay so here you can see 59 minutes so
392:25 - it's basically we get access for one
392:27 - hour so now come down
392:29 - and just click on this Azure portal
392:34 - now here you will get the interface and
392:36 - maybe uh you will need to sign in with
392:39 - your Microsoft account and only then you
392:41 - will get the access
392:45 - okay it's taking some time let's wait
392:47 - okay here we go now here you will see
392:50 - the virtual machine you have to just
392:51 - click on it virtual machine
392:54 - and you will need to just go on Create
392:57 - and click on this as your virtual
392:59 - machine
393:04 - sometimes yeah
393:07 - here you have to just select your
393:09 - resource Group
393:12 - and virtual machine name I will just
393:16 - use this name Linux VM and the username
393:18 - and password
393:20 - so I will write the username as I use
393:22 - and the password I will write
393:30 - sorry
393:36 - okay again enter the password
393:42 - okay password match so here SSS 2022
393:45 - Port is allowed so basically sap command
393:47 - runs on this particular Port by default
393:50 - okay
393:51 - so uh next you will do but here you
393:55 - don't have to change any kind of
393:56 - settings and all
393:58 - it will be by default it will be same
394:01 - okay we don't need to change anything
394:05 - okay here we go now what do you have to
394:08 - you have to just click on review press
394:09 - create it will take approx one minute of
394:12 - time
394:16 - uh okay
394:18 - till now I pause the video
394:23 - okay guys so here you can see the
394:25 - validation is passed so now we have to
394:28 - just click on this create button
394:31 - so it will just create a virtual machine
394:33 - and we will get the
394:35 - public IP address of that particular
394:37 - machine and we will use that particular
394:38 - IPS address to connect with this machine
394:40 - and whatever the username and password
394:43 - we have provided while creating this
394:45 - virtual machine we will uh use that one
394:48 - to connect to this particular remote
394:49 - host
394:52 - so let's wait for some time it will just
394:53 - hardly take uh two to three minutes of
394:55 - time
394:57 - okay so deployment is in progress let's
394:59 - wait
395:04 - okay so till now uh till then I just uh
395:06 - give you the overview of what is the sap
395:09 - command so already I have told you like
395:12 - this command is used to like
395:15 - copy the file from one host to remote
395:17 - host
395:19 - so here basically this machine is my uh
395:22 - physical host physical machine you can
395:25 - say and the Machine to which I will
395:27 - connect like this virtual machine that
395:29 - will be my remote host so I will use
395:32 - this command to share file from this
395:34 - machine
395:35 - to another machine so there are also
395:38 - some many of options we use for fast
395:41 - transfer for getting information while
395:43 - transferring we will use all those
395:46 - particular functions
395:48 - so here you can see the deployment is
395:50 - complete now we have to just click on go
395:52 - to Resource and we we will get the
395:54 - particular public IP address
395:57 - and here it will show yeah here
396:01 - is the public IP address first of all
396:03 - what I will do I will just uh try to
396:05 - connect to that particular machine using
396:07 - the credential which we had provided in
396:09 - Mobile creation
396:11 - I hope the terminally visible to you
396:13 - just to SSH and whatever the username I
396:17 - use and the IP address
396:19 - okay so you have used to write yes it
396:23 - will uh
396:27 - permission denied publicly okay I don't
396:29 - know let me just close the terminal and
396:30 - again I will open up
396:35 - SSH I use
396:39 - at the rate IP address
396:43 - okay password it's asking me for
396:46 - password
396:50 - hit enter okay now I hope I have entered
396:52 - correct address uh correct password okay
396:55 - okay so now here you can see the uh
396:58 - whatever the host name we had added like
396:59 - Linux VM and I usually the username okay
397:02 - so if I will do uh clear the screen and
397:04 - I will write who am I
397:07 - so here you can see the uh
397:10 - username is ayush and uh also you can
397:13 - see this hostname has been changed from
397:14 - Linux VM
397:16 - uh from I used to link swim I think let
397:18 - me again open up one terminal and here
397:20 - you can see I use virtualbox is there
397:22 - okay so this one is my
397:26 - remote machine I just add one command
397:29 - here
397:31 - remote
397:33 - machine and I will just provide the IP
397:36 - address
397:37 - okay so this is the
397:40 - like command view hash for writing the
397:42 - comment in this terminal now moving
397:43 - forward another use of the sap command
397:46 - comes here if we have a file suppose I
397:49 - have to just create one file let me
397:51 - create one file with the name of
397:52 - cactus.txt
397:55 - and I will just not test I will write
397:58 - some another cat remote file Dot txt and
398:03 - I will write something like this file
398:07 - is being sent from
398:11 - ayush physical
398:14 - machine
398:16 - Ctrl D to save now we have to use the
398:19 - SCP command so basically SCP what it
398:22 - stands for it basically stands for
398:24 - secure copy so you will send the file
398:27 - using uh Port like 2022 it basically by
398:31 - default it uses Port 2022 and also our
398:33 - this machine accepts only port number 22
398:36 - no other port number it accepts if
398:38 - request is coming from
398:40 - coming for the some other port number uh
398:42 - other than 2022 then in that case it
398:45 - will not reply back to that particular
398:49 - host okay
398:51 - so now what we have to do uh I will just
398:53 - let me do LS
398:56 - so here you can see the remote file dot
398:58 - text is there
399:00 - and let me just clear the screen and SCP
399:03 - I will use and I will use hyphen capital
399:06 - c for the faster transfer and the file
399:09 - name that is the remote file Dot txt and
399:12 - the username I will also need to provide
399:14 - here
399:15 - ayush
399:18 - are you shared the rate and the Ctrl
399:20 - shift V and I will need to provide the
399:22 - location where we want to just
399:26 - what we say store that file so I will
399:29 - store this file at this particular
399:31 - location home ayush
399:33 - and 251 and I will just need to use this
399:38 - colon
399:39 - and
399:42 - sorry
399:44 - okay sorry sorry I just
399:49 - I will need to again write the command
399:53 - so here I have to just
399:57 - use slash omis okay so here what will
400:00 - happen basically uh this remote file dot
400:02 - txt will get transferred from this must
400:04 - into this machine like copy will be
400:06 - transferred so let me just hit enter and
400:09 - it will ask me to enter the password
400:11 - and I will just enter the password
400:16 - okay done
400:19 - so here you can see hundred percent so
400:21 - 0.2 kb per second was the speed and uh
400:24 - let me clear the screen and I will do LS
400:26 - so here you can see the remote file.txt
400:28 - has been
400:29 - uh like copied into this particular
400:31 - remote host okay uh like let me uh just
400:37 - send another file also let me create
400:39 - ios.txt
400:47 - okay
400:48 - Ctrl D to save
400:50 - again I will use the same command just
400:52 - change the file name
400:56 - file name to ayush now hit enter again
400:59 - maybe hope it will
401:01 - ask me to enter the password but let's
401:04 - see yeah I will need to enter the
401:06 - password that is Kumar Walmart 38098
401:09 - hash
401:11 - hit enter and uh
401:13 - the file will get copied into that
401:15 - particular location
401:18 - okay it's taking time I don't know why
401:23 - okay now you are done so I will do again
401:27 - LS here
401:28 - so here you can see eyes dot txt has
401:30 - been copied now I will just
401:32 - try to read the content of this
401:34 - particular file
401:36 - Okay so
401:42 - I think the connection is slow that's
401:44 - why it's lagging
401:47 - okay sorry I've used wrong I have to
401:50 - read this
401:51 - okay okay
401:57 - let me just remove this
402:04 - okay yeah
402:07 - now just hit enter
402:11 - so basically it has overwritten with the
402:15 - like nothing we had written so by this
402:17 - command basically the text was
402:18 - overwritten
402:20 - no problem let me just read another file
402:22 - we have also transferred another file
402:23 - that is the remote file.txt
402:26 - we can read this
402:27 - okay so here you can see this file is
402:29 - being synchronized physical machine the
402:31 - same text which we had written in this
402:34 - particular physical machine
402:36 - okay so in this way we can transfer the
402:38 - files from one machine to another
402:39 - machine and also by default the CPU uses
402:42 - AES so 128 encryption method to encrypt
402:47 - files while while translate you can say
402:50 - but if you have to use some another
402:52 - method then you can use the iPhone C
402:55 - Small option also if you if you want to
402:58 - use some some different port number uh
403:00 - like if you will need to use then hyphen
403:03 - capital P option okay but by default
403:06 - this machine is accepting only the port
403:08 - number 2022 so if I will use some
403:11 - another port number then in that case it
403:13 - will not uh what we say
403:16 - it will not accept the request so if I
403:18 - will do hyphen Port 234 and I will just
403:21 - try to I will remove the files from this
403:25 - machine
403:27 - okay it's like running so I don't know
403:29 - maybe it's
403:32 - reason behind is slow connection it may
403:34 - be
403:35 - so I'll just remove the iso.txt file
403:37 - here
403:38 - okay sorry
403:40 - you should take the area
403:43 - so now file has been removed and now I
403:46 - have used the hyphen p234 and I will use
403:49 - hyphen Capital C option and just hit
403:51 - enter so in this in this case you will
403:54 - get like it will not accept the request
403:57 - like
403:58 - it uh it will not display anything
404:01 - nothing will happen
404:03 - okay to solve this issue we will need to
404:07 - use just a hyphen V option also hyphen
404:09 - small V that is just used for getting
404:12 - the
404:14 - default information
404:16 - okay
404:19 - hopefully we will get
404:23 - s not connecting to the spot number
404:26 - yeah because port number is not open
404:28 - that port number is not open in this
404:30 - machine that's why
404:31 - so if I will use just sport number 2022
404:38 - and we have used the wrong command also
404:42 - hyphen P 2022 iPhone C Small hyphen V
404:48 - and now hit enter and here you got all
404:51 - the information
404:52 - so now you have to just enter the
404:54 - password but develop again ever we will
404:56 - see the information like connecting to
404:59 - this particular IP address on Port 2022
405:01 - enter the password
405:06 - so done
405:08 - next okay sending command sending file
405:11 - modes
405:12 - I store TX 300 15 compressed outgoing
405:15 - raw data this compressed to this so
405:18 - while Transit Transit what happens
405:19 - whatever the amount of whatever size of
405:21 - your file will get compressed and then
405:23 - again it will whenever we it will reach
405:25 - to the remote machine it will uh like
405:28 - stored in the original form
405:31 - so again if I do LS here
405:35 - so you will get the ice.txt file okay
405:38 - so uh now let's do with the different
405:41 - port number
405:43 - let's see what happens actually total
405:46 - port number in network we use our act
405:48 - prox 65 535 for the total port numbers
405:53 - so I have just tailed it told about this
405:55 - for your information only
405:58 - so here you will see connecting to this
406:00 - particular IP and the port then you can
406:03 - see the port and after this nothing will
406:05 - happen because
406:07 - this machine is not
406:09 - accepting any port number
406:11 - other than Port 2022
406:15 - so it will not happen anything it will
406:17 - go in the infinite Loop you can say and
406:19 - bus like we just need to
406:21 - hit Ctrl C
406:24 - so basically in this way you can use the
406:26 - sap command to share files from one
406:28 - machine to another machine remotely or
406:31 - or also you can say like the two remote
406:34 - machines are there then and only then
406:35 - you can use this particular command so
406:38 - that's all for today's video and I hope
406:39 - you liked it if you have any queries
406:41 - then you can ask us in the comment
406:42 - section so thank you thank you for
406:44 - watching and we'll meet in the next one
406:45 - thank you
406:48 - hello guys now in this particular video
406:50 - we are going to cover about the most
406:51 - important command that is the uptime
406:53 - command Okay so uh this is a very simple
406:56 - command and it will not take much time
406:58 - so let me introduce you first with what
407:01 - is this and so basically uptime is a
407:03 - command which is basically we use to
407:05 - find the how long the server is running
407:07 - okay so let's start with the
407:10 - implementation part
407:12 - so I will just hit up time oh sorry
407:16 - it's up time and here you can see it's
407:20 - 18 5151 that is 651 and up for since uh
407:27 - 34 Minute like from right now it's 6 51
407:31 - as you can see it's 652 right now
407:34 - and now it's running till uh 34 Minute
407:37 - and number of users who are logged in
407:39 - that is only one user is logged in and
407:42 - this is the average load you can see
407:44 - okay
407:45 - so to get output in a very easy way to
407:49 - in understandable where this is there
407:52 - are multiple things here like
407:54 - current time up time okay users okay so
407:58 - but before that let me increase the font
408:01 - size I forgot to increase
408:03 - okay so I can use different options uh
408:06 - you can use hyphen is to see what are
408:09 - the options available so here you can
408:11 - see hyphen P it will show uptime in
408:14 - pretty format so let's use this and
408:17 - let's check whether output comes in
408:19 - pretty format or not
408:21 - so uptime hyphen P we are done okay so
408:24 - the server is running from
408:26 - uh it's running since 35 minutes okay
408:30 - uh let's use another option we will use
408:33 - hyphen s
408:35 - so it's uh the time at that time was 6
408:39 - 17 okay now it's 6 53
408:42 - okay so and you can check the version of
408:45 - this uptime command using hyphen V
408:50 - okay this is something
408:53 - 3.3.17 okay
408:55 - so I hope you liked it guys this video
408:57 - so as this command you basically useful
408:59 - uh when you go in a corporate and you
409:03 - need to fetch some server uptime whether
409:05 - the servers is running or not okay so in
409:08 - that case you can use this basically
409:09 - command Okay so that's it for today's
409:11 - video and I will meet you in the next
409:13 - one thank you thank you for watching
409:16 - now in this video we are going to learn
409:18 - about the most interesting command that
409:20 - is a union command okay so basically
409:21 - this command is used to get the
409:23 - information about your machine okay so
409:25 - basically we will use this command to
409:27 - get the information about this Ubuntu
409:29 - machine
409:30 - so uh we will basically start with this
409:32 - and we will use some of the flags or you
409:34 - can say options with this uh Union
409:36 - command to get the host name to get the
409:38 - kernel whatever the kernel is being used
409:40 - in this particular machine what is the
409:42 - name of the kernel and also you will get
409:44 - multiple information like operating
409:47 - system Hardware platform information
409:48 - machine information everything you will
409:50 - get to know in this particular video
409:52 - so uh let's start with the
409:55 - implementation part so here you name if
409:57 - you provide without any option if you
409:59 - will execute this command you will just
410:01 - get the uh like name of the
410:04 - kernel name you will get okay so here
410:07 - you can see as we already know like in
410:09 - the installation video we have so like
410:11 - uh the Ubuntu is based on the Linux
410:13 - kernel so that's why it is showing the
410:16 - Linux so but before starting uh the like
410:19 - going deep into the video I want to just
410:21 - uh give you the overview of what is the
410:23 - Linux kernel okay so all units connect
410:25 - basically you can say is the core of the
410:27 - operating system okay if there is an
410:28 - operating system the current will be the
410:30 - core of that operating system babe why
410:32 - because it creates an interface you can
410:34 - say or creates a connection between your
410:37 - Hardware
410:40 - hardware and your software okay so
410:45 - basically uh kernel has all the control
410:48 - of your operating system if kernel fails
410:51 - then whole operating system will get
410:52 - failed you can say like that also so I
410:55 - hope that is a basic information is
410:58 - clear to you and we will see about
411:00 - kernel release what is Kernel release so
411:02 - uh let me tell you about the kernel
411:04 - release So currently this is nothing but
411:05 - whenever a new version is released of a
411:08 - kernel like if there is suppose a
411:10 - version is suppose 5.0.1 you can say
411:13 - like that then again new version is
411:16 - create release that is 5.0.2 so why this
411:19 - new version and why this new kernel
411:21 - release has been done because if there
411:24 - is some vulnerability or any bugs in the
411:26 - first kernel then that bug will get
411:27 - passed and then again new release will
411:30 - be
411:31 - done okay and you can release will be
411:34 - done okay so that is the concept
411:36 - basically current release so now we will
411:38 - see the uh
411:40 - kernel release so for this we basically
411:43 - use the hyphen R option so here you can
411:46 - see the now currently version and
411:48 - current release version of this machine
411:49 - is this 5.15.0
411:52 - 41 generic okay
411:55 - so in this way you can get the kernel
411:56 - release information now moving forward
411:58 - uh let me just show you this uh
412:01 - Linux like kernel name you can use a
412:05 - hyphen s option also to get the
412:08 - kernel name okay
412:10 - so uh like both will give you the same
412:13 - result like unim and unim hyphen s uh
412:16 - okay and now next moving forward uh if
412:20 - you want to get the host name of your
412:22 - computer like hostname is like that name
412:25 - which is used over the network you can
412:27 - say like that so if you you will do unim
412:30 - hyphen and then obviously you will get
412:32 - the hostname as in my case this is ayush
412:34 - virtualbox is the hostname
412:36 - and again next if you want to get
412:38 - information about your machine about
412:40 - your processor then you can use hyphen M
412:43 - for your machine
412:44 - U name hyphen M for your machine so like
412:48 - it is 64-bit you can say you can see
412:50 - here it is and next if you want to get
412:53 - information about your processor then
412:55 - it's also easy you can get using iPhone
412:57 - P option
412:59 - so same
413:01 - information is being displayed here like
413:03 - it is the basically the architecture
413:06 - okay so now next moving forward uh if
413:09 - you want to get a hardware platform all
413:12 - those things you will get the same I
413:13 - think yeah Hardware platform is the same
413:15 - 64-bit and to get the name of the
413:18 - operating system so obviously it is uh
413:21 - gnu Linux so links operating system it
413:24 - is Ubuntu so
413:27 - now again uh like there is also one uh
413:30 - super command you can say like super
413:32 - option that is hyphen a option which
413:34 - basically gives you all the result of
413:36 - these like you do you don't need to
413:38 - write this all to get if kernel release
413:41 - you you you don't need to uh
413:46 - anything you can use a simple command
413:48 - that is a u name
413:51 - hyphen a
413:53 - hit enter and here you will get the all
413:54 - the above information like Linux is the
413:56 - kernel name this is the host name this
413:59 - is the version and this is the uh what
414:03 - you can say I think this is uh your uh
414:07 - version name it maybe yeah it should be
414:10 - version name like hashtag Ubuntu SMP
414:14 - yeah it's a kernel version name it is
414:16 - and next is the date of creation or
414:18 - installation
414:20 - and next is your all the architecture
414:23 - processor architecture everything you
414:25 - can see and and at the last you can see
414:28 - the name of the operating system
414:31 - so I hope you liked it guys that was a
414:33 - very uh basic tutorial so that's all for
414:36 - today's video and if you have any
414:37 - queries then you can ask in the comment
414:39 - section so thank you
414:40 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
414:42 - video thank you thank you so much
414:45 - now in this video we are going to learn
414:47 - about another command uh that is the
414:49 - host name command okay so basically
414:51 - hostname command is we use to get the
414:54 - information about your what is the host
414:56 - name like this name and how you can
414:59 - change the name also with the help of
415:01 - host command you will get the uh IP
415:05 - address okay
415:06 - so we will start with the implementation
415:08 - part
415:10 - so let me increase the first font size
415:12 - so hope it is visible to you so now what
415:16 - we have to do we have to just write a
415:17 - hostname so it will basically give you
415:19 - the whatever the host name of your
415:20 - computer that is this one I use
415:22 - virtualbox okay
415:23 - so also you can uh like uh what we say
415:27 - change the host name and also you can
415:30 - get the IP address using different
415:32 - options if I will use hyphen I then it
415:34 - will give me this localhost IP address
415:36 - and but if you will use the capital i
415:40 - then in that case you will get the
415:42 - actual IP address and whatever the IP
415:44 - address the will be present in your
415:46 - system so in this case we have only one
415:49 - IP address and now moving forward uh
415:52 - the interesting part of this particular
415:54 - video is that you can change the host
415:57 - name also so how you can do it it
416:00 - totally there are basically two methods
416:02 - and you should be like uh run this
416:06 - command as a root okay like in my case
416:09 - this ayush user is like in the sudos
416:12 - file and we can easily change using this
416:15 - particular command so how you can do it
416:17 - uh you have to just use this particular
416:20 - sudo host name and host name and then
416:25 - what we have to do you have to just give
416:27 - the uh different
416:29 - name okay I will give this one
416:32 - actually this is my Instagram page
416:34 - username uh you can follow if you want
416:38 - so
416:41 - I think I enter wrong password let me
416:44 - erase now I use
416:47 - okay so a specified hostname is invaded
416:49 - because we have used underscore so
416:51 - underscores are not allowed I will just
416:53 - remove it underscores
416:56 - and hit enter and now I will again open
416:59 - up the one terminal new terminal and
417:00 - here you can see the
417:03 - host name has been changed from ayush
417:06 - virtualbox to this one exabyte okay so
417:10 - but now what I want I want to uh like
417:13 - keep my host name as it is so I will
417:15 - just copy this one
417:18 - and what I'll do I will just again uh
417:22 - run this command and use this and now in
417:25 - this case you will get it same at same
417:28 - as preview previous one okay
417:30 - so moving forward uh if you want to
417:32 - change this hostname in some kind of
417:35 - different method so how you can do it
417:36 - it's uh it is very unique thing you can
417:39 - say like you will you will use the
417:42 - one file I will create one file that is
417:44 - uh let's create with the hostname.txt
417:48 - and I will write the
417:50 - hostname as let me write
417:53 - let's write same thing as a white and
417:56 - Ctrl D to save and now what we have to
417:58 - do uh you have to just use this command
418:01 - that is the sudo
418:06 - host name and capital F and the file
418:09 - name which webkit that is hostname.txt
418:12 - and now again I will open the new
418:14 - terminal and here you can see the
418:17 - hostname has been changed from Ice
418:19 - virtualbox to excavate again
418:22 - so in this way you can change the host
418:24 - name also very easily now moving forward
418:26 - uh if you talk about the like fqdn that
418:31 - is a fully qualified domain name that is
418:33 - basically a domain name for a specific
418:34 - computer or a host on the internet you
418:36 - can select that so how you find it using
418:39 - this only one option that is hyphen f so
418:43 - this is the now my actual
418:47 - hostname so in this case you can get the
418:49 - fqdns also if you want to learn more
418:51 - about it you can just Google it what is
418:53 - what are fqdns
418:55 - so uh first now let me again change my
418:58 - hostname to the previous one this one
419:00 - yeah
419:01 - now it changed
419:04 - so yeah done
419:06 - so uh I hope you like this particular
419:08 - video and if you have any queries if you
419:10 - have any doubt then please ask us in the
419:12 - comment section so that's all for
419:13 - today's video we will stop here and I
419:15 - will meet you in the next video so thank
419:17 - you thank you for watching and we'll
419:18 - meet you next one thank you guys bye
419:21 - now in this video we are going to learn
419:22 - about the password command okay so
419:24 - basically uh this command is basically
419:26 - we used to change the password of any
419:29 - user or if you want to add uh like
419:32 - password expiration days or anything you
419:34 - want to perform with the password any
419:36 - kind of operation like if you want to
419:39 - delete the password you want to make
419:40 - account passwordless then this command
419:43 - is used okay so we will basically start
419:45 - with the user creation like we will
419:47 - first of all add a user
419:49 - and then we will perform that operation
419:52 - on that particular user so I'm adding
419:55 - one user here
419:57 - only one or two names allowed okay
420:01 - I'm just giving the name as
420:06 - a password user
420:09 - here new password it asking me for
420:12 - I will give the new password
420:15 - okay no required these information yes
420:19 - okay clear now first of all what I will
420:22 - do I first
420:26 - login into that user
420:29 - password user
420:31 - and I will just enter the password and
420:33 - yeah here you can see I'm logged in into
420:35 - that particular user
420:36 - and now I will just exit because I want
420:40 - to use my account okay so let's start
420:42 - with the uh
420:46 - password
420:48 - command okay
420:50 - so now what we have to do you the
420:52 - command is basically used with the sudo
420:55 - why because only the root user or
420:59 - whatever the user who is present in the
421:01 - sudoers file that that can only change
421:03 - the password or the current user if you
421:06 - uh do like this sudo and only password
421:10 - it will what it will do it will change
421:12 - the password of your current account
421:14 - that is my account that is ayush and it
421:17 - will ask me for the new password okay
421:19 - but I don't want to uh change my
421:21 - password okay so uh for a minute let's
421:24 - change
421:26 - so as you can see password updated
421:28 - successfully
421:30 - but again I want to keep my old password
421:34 - so I will write that password
421:45 - okay password did successfully okay so
421:48 - now moving forward what you can do if
421:50 - you want to change the password of any
421:51 - other account that is a root account
421:53 - then also you can change that how you
421:55 - can do it that is sudo
421:57 - password
421:59 - that is pass WD not a full password so
422:02 - pass WD and then the user account name
422:04 - that is root so here you can change
422:08 - the password password updated
422:10 - successfully now what you can do you can
422:12 - just log in with that credentials using
422:14 - SEO that is switch user command
422:17 - and here you will need to just uh
422:25 - okay so now here you can just enter the
422:28 - password of the root user and you will
422:29 - get the access of the root account okay
422:31 - so with this you can change the password
422:34 - of any other user and also you can do
422:36 - many operations okay so now what we will
422:39 - do we will just uh change the password
422:41 - of this the user which we had created
422:44 - now so let me close this terminal
422:47 - and I will just copy this username
422:50 - because it's so long username I had
422:52 - taken
422:53 - no problem just to sudo
422:56 - password and the name of the user that
422:58 - is a password user an enter and a new
423:01 - password I will provide him just okay
423:04 - password updated successfully so now
423:07 - what I will do I will just open up the
423:08 - new terminal and I will log in with that
423:10 - new password I know the password is not
423:12 - visible because
423:14 - the this is the feature of the Linux
423:16 - like you cannot see the password like
423:19 - it's a great thing
423:20 - okay password user user user okay it's
423:26 - not coming okay now door okay yeah so
423:29 - here you can see you have we have logged
423:31 - in with this particular account so now
423:33 - let's do some certain operations like
423:36 - now what I will do I will just close up
423:37 - this terminal and I will
423:41 - just use some some options here it's
423:44 - like a hyphen D option now we will use
423:46 - so basically what happened this option
423:48 - deletes the password and make the
423:51 - account password list
423:53 - okay so if we do like this
423:58 - password hyphen D and the username that
424:01 - is a
424:02 - password user
424:06 - and here I have to use sudo
424:10 - so password expiry information changed
424:13 - okay now what I will do I will just
424:15 - again open up the new terminal and I
424:17 - will try to login and I will check
424:18 - whether it asks me for entering the
424:20 - password or not so here you can see it
424:22 - is not asking me to enter any password
424:24 - as you can see the password user uh like
424:27 - is logged in now if I will do here who
424:29 - am I here it will show me the password
424:31 - user so using hyphen D option you can
424:34 - just make any account passwordless
424:36 - so suppose uh if you want to create a
424:39 - guest account for the like any user who
424:42 - want to use the system and you will just
424:44 - give him thumbs give him that certain
424:47 - permissions like not you will not
424:48 - provide him the root permission
424:50 - and you can create his account
424:52 - passwordless the guest account could be
424:54 - password Let's uh let it be okay it will
424:56 - not affect your system or the
424:59 - administrator
425:02 - so in this way you can just create a
425:04 - passwordless account
425:06 - now moving forward uh let me try to just
425:09 - add the password let me check what
425:11 - happens
425:13 - if I do sudo
425:16 - password password user
425:20 - I hate my asking me to enter the new
425:22 - password I am again entering and now I
425:25 - will just exit here and again I will try
425:27 - to just switch into that account
425:30 - and now it should ask me to enter the
425:33 - password and here you can see it's
425:34 - asking me to enter the password now here
425:36 - you can see I have logged in as the
425:38 - password user
425:39 - okay so in this way you can add the
425:43 - password remove the password you can
425:45 - login into that account you using
425:48 - terminal using switch user command
425:50 - so many information you got till now
425:53 - okay now moving forward uh
425:55 - suppose if you want to like immediately
425:58 - change the password if you suppose if
426:01 - you will use hyphen e option let me
426:03 - clear the screen first
426:06 - I will use sudo password hyphen e option
426:08 - if you you will use hypheny option so
426:11 - what it option does it basically uh like
426:13 - prompt the user to change your password
426:16 - after login
426:17 - okay so let me show you just uh the
426:21 - implementation part I will just to use
426:23 - that username password user
426:25 - password expired changed and again I
426:27 - will exit and again I will try to just
426:29 - log in with this user sorry password
426:31 - user and I will just enter the password
426:34 - and it will ask me to you are required
426:36 - to change your password immediately
426:37 - administrator enforce like as I add main
426:40 - I just reinforce that particular user to
426:42 - change your password immediately
426:45 - okay you got it like Suppose there is a
426:47 - like organization in which the admin
426:49 - want to change the like admin wants like
426:53 - uh their users should change their
426:55 - password immediately okay so he can just
426:58 - add multiple users and then he will
427:02 - enforce them to change their password
427:03 - immediately okay so it will ask me to
427:05 - enter the current password and the new
427:07 - password I will write
427:09 - foreign
427:13 - characters so I have to enter the
427:15 - password which is longer than 8
427:17 - characters
427:21 - okay the password face the dictionary
427:24 - check it doesn't contain enough
427:25 - character okay no problem so but uh you
427:28 - got the point I just didn't use the
427:30 - strong password that's why it's showing
427:31 - like this but in case of you if you will
427:34 - enter the combination of the 0 and 1 and
427:36 - be capital letters small letters
427:38 - characters then that will make the
427:40 - basically a strong password
427:42 - okay so now I'm moving forward I hope
427:45 - you got this point okay but still let it
427:47 - be I will just let me show you the
427:49 - implementation otherwise you will think
427:50 - like uh
427:51 - I didn't showed you the implementation
427:54 - but again let me just do the same thing
427:57 - and I will just log in that user I will
428:00 - enter the password and current password
428:02 - it is asking me current password I will
428:04 - just enter the password
428:07 - some long password I will enter
428:09 - okay so it's not showing any kind of air
428:12 - right now so
428:13 - sorry again I will need to do the same
428:17 - thing
428:21 - again there is some type mistake
428:25 - it should not done yeah okay finally if
428:28 - we change the password okay now if you
428:30 - do who am I and you can see like I am
428:31 - logged in as the password user
428:34 - okay so using iPhone option you can just
428:37 - force the particular user to change
428:39 - their password immediately after login
428:42 - okay so now moving forward uh if you
428:45 - want to add the like some number of days
428:48 - like uh minimum number of days required
428:50 - to change the password suppose you
428:52 - create a user and like uh Suppose there
428:56 - is a organization and there is a intern
429:01 - okay
429:02 - in turn comes in organization
429:06 - comes in organization to do internship
429:11 - so obviously you will provide him he
429:14 - will work for some kind of 90 days or
429:17 - 120 days or any number of days he will
429:19 - work so obviously you will create their
429:21 - account and you want to automatically
429:24 - expire their account after a certain
429:25 - period of time or or you want to change
429:28 - his password after a certain period of
429:29 - time
429:30 - okay there are many number of
429:32 - requirements you can do so to do these
429:34 - kind of things we use the minimum days
429:36 - okay mean days option so it means we
429:39 - cannot change the password before 100
429:41 - days if you provide 100 in her
429:45 - you know option okay suppose the intern
429:47 - you don't want to change the password of
429:50 - intent till his journey
429:53 - suppose you're starting from 0 to uh 50
429:55 - days if there is intention of 50 days
429:57 - and you don't want to change the uh and
429:59 - you don't want to like in turn to change
430:02 - his password
430:03 - in this case you can use easily uh
430:05 - hyphen Mendes option so let me use this
430:09 - option like it's a great thing I will
430:11 - use this password and a hyphen main days
430:14 - I will use Min days and the number of
430:17 - days I
430:19 - this time assuming the 50 and uh
430:23 - username
430:25 - password user I think it was the
430:27 - username yeah
430:29 - okay so there is a invite option it is
430:32 - showing me uh okay is there any
430:37 - okay there is no any option with hyphen
430:40 - M okay let me just try with hyphen
430:43 - iPhone Mendes maybe it should work let's
430:46 - see
430:47 - okay it's showing me permission deny and
430:50 - why it's so just clear the screen I have
430:52 - not used sudo here that so it's showing
430:53 - me permission denial so sudo and
430:55 - password expired information change and
430:57 - now what I will do I will just
430:59 - not exit I will just clear the screen
431:02 - and now I'm logged in as the password
431:05 - user and I will try to change my
431:07 - password
431:08 - so whether I'm able to change or not
431:10 - let's see because I have changed the
431:12 - permission of like I cannot change my
431:14 - password
431:16 - like uh
431:18 - till 50 days
431:20 - okay changing password for password user
431:23 - okay but now let me just close this
431:25 - session because this is uh like you can
431:27 - say
431:28 - old session I will create a new session
431:30 - and then I will try to change the
431:32 - password
431:33 - sudo yeah sorry Su password user
431:39 - and the password what it was yeah
431:43 - I forgot yeah
431:46 - let me just increase the font size I
431:48 - will just render this password and I
431:49 - will write Uh current password
431:54 - okay so here you can see you must wait
431:56 - longer to change your password
431:58 - okay so this is a like get a feature
432:01 - like you cannot change your password
432:04 - before 50 days okay similarly you can
432:08 - use the max days option it will just
432:10 - like
432:12 - suppose if you provide 100 days then
432:14 - after that what will happen your
432:16 - password will expire and you will need
432:19 - to obviously change that password and
432:21 - okay so what we will do we'll just Ctrl
432:24 - C okay it's not working control so I
432:26 - don't know why let me just type like
432:29 - this okay
432:31 - password unchanged and now what I will
432:33 - do I will just use Max Steel option so
432:36 - what it will do it will just uh like
432:39 - your password will get expired after
432:41 - this number of days so I will just leave
432:43 - it uh
432:45 - as
432:47 - 100
432:49 - password expiry chain and you your
432:52 - password will expire after 100 days okay
432:55 - and also you can use another option that
432:58 - is one days option password hyphen
433:00 - iPhone one days
433:03 - so it will warn you to change your
433:04 - password before expiry
433:06 - okay
433:09 - so permission denied you know the reason
433:12 - because we have not used sudo here
433:15 - expiry changed okay so this is the way
433:18 - to manipulate with the
433:21 - uh password command okay and also one
433:24 - more thing is there like inactive is
433:25 - also one option which we can use to
433:27 - deactivate account suppose after 10 days
433:30 - of expiration uh the password expires
433:33 - and uh and still you don't change the
433:35 - password in that because your account
433:36 - will get deactivated
433:38 - okay and also one more option is there
433:40 - that is password hyphen capital S and
433:43 - sudo
433:45 - and I will just provide a username hope
433:48 - it will work yeah so here it will show
433:50 - you some of the information like you can
433:53 - see the date the today's date is 39.22
433:55 - IP just shows the
433:57 - uh like uh account is locked or unlocked
434:05 - and here the date shows the creation of
434:08 - the password and the 50 is the minimum
434:10 - days and 100 is the maximum days as we
434:12 - got to know and 10 is the warning days
434:14 - you can see here okay so that's all for
434:16 - today's video guys and I hope you liked
434:18 - it and if you have any queries then you
434:20 - can ask in the comment section and
434:21 - please just give me the feedback in the
434:24 - comment section like how is the videos
434:25 - going on and are you getting or not and
434:29 - also you can ask me if you have any
434:31 - doubt on Instagram you can just you can
434:33 - just
434:35 - follow this page that is exabyte I know
434:38 - the name is little bit difficult uh
434:40 - after K you can just search as
434:42 - underscore
434:43 - 3xabyt 3 underscore
434:46 - okay you can ask me out here also so
434:49 - that's all for today guys and we'll meet
434:51 - you in the next one so thank you and we
434:53 - will meet you next one bye
434:56 - now in this video we are going to learn
434:58 - about the chh command okay so basically
435:00 - this is similar command uh just we
435:02 - learned about in previous View that is
435:04 - password command but in this we cannot
435:06 - change the password okay so we will
435:09 - start with the basic options and basic
435:12 - implementation of this command so that
435:13 - is Chas and using hyphen L you can get
435:16 - the information of a password of any
435:18 - account
435:19 - but before moving forward we will need
435:21 - to create a password sorry not password
435:25 - a user
435:27 - sudo not user ad I will use add user
435:32 - and I will name that user as a exabyte
435:41 - okay
435:43 - so I will just use like this x sub by
435:48 - height
435:50 - exabyte okay
435:51 - password
435:55 - nothing nothing nothing nothing
435:57 - why okay clear the screen now just chh
436:03 - and provide hyphen L as option and the
436:06 - username that is exabyte
436:09 - um okay
436:11 - permission denied okay no problem we
436:13 - will just use the sudo and we will get
436:15 - the permission
436:17 - is that easy yes okay so here you can
436:20 - see the last password change is that 7
436:22 - like 30 September it means today's date
436:25 - and password expires never never nothing
436:27 - is added account expires the thing is
436:30 - added minimum number of days written
436:31 - password change is zero by default and
436:34 - by default maximum is 999 it's uh like
436:38 - it takes the date from 1970 I think
436:40 - that's why it's showing that number of
436:42 - days and warning warning is this like if
436:45 - your password get like
436:49 - uh uh ninth after before
436:53 - seven days of this completion you will
436:55 - get a warning okay so now let's move and
436:58 - I will use this we will use the maximum
437:01 - number of days like we will use hyphen M
437:03 - option to change the
437:06 - maximum number of days like this one
437:09 - so how we can do it cha is hyphen
437:12 - capital M I will just use 100 and the
437:14 - username that is uh
437:16 - this one and permission denied again
437:18 - because we have not used sudo let me use
437:21 - sudo and done and we will just delete
437:24 - the screen and just call that function
437:26 - and here on that command and here you
437:28 - can see the maximum number of days
437:30 - between password change is 100. now
437:32 - similarly you can just add the minimum
437:34 - number of days also what it will do like
437:36 - it will just you cannot change your
437:38 - password
437:39 - before that particular days whatever you
437:42 - specify in minimum days so you can do it
437:45 - it's simple just instead of capital M
437:47 - you will need to use iPhone M and you
437:49 - can use here the number of days that is
437:51 - 50. like till 50 days you cannot change
437:53 - your password
437:55 - again let me show the information
437:58 - and here you can see the 50 days like
438:01 - minimum number of days written password
438:02 - change is 50.
438:04 - moving forward if you will provide a
438:07 - minus one option then what will happen
438:09 - let's see
438:10 - with maximum amount of days it will
438:13 - remove that it will not check for that
438:15 - validation
438:17 - hyphen M and if I will provide -1 and I
438:21 - will do again check and here you can see
438:22 - minus one it will like it will not check
438:24 - for the maximum number of days if you
438:26 - will use minus one but I don't want to
438:28 - use minus one I will simply use the 100
438:31 - to keep things
438:34 - simple
438:35 - okay
438:36 - moving forward if you will use 0 in a
438:41 - small M like in minimum number of days
438:42 - it means the user can change the
438:45 - password anytime
438:48 - but if you but if you use some kind of
438:51 - number here then user can can change
438:54 - that person after that number of days if
438:56 - I'll use 0 then user can change the
438:58 - password anytime if he wants okay that
439:02 - is the main use of zero
439:04 - and but I will use 50 here
439:07 - okay
439:09 - now moving forward uh if you want to add
439:12 - the expiry date in your password like
439:14 - your password should expired after that
439:16 - certain number of days
439:18 - okay so how you can do it if I will use
439:20 - like this sudo
439:24 - let me just yeah sudo hyphen capital E
439:28 - and I will use the format as year 2022
439:34 - uh 10 and 0 1. in the username
439:43 - okay and tomorrow my password will get
439:45 - expired
439:47 - and here you can see account experience
439:50 - it's on October 1 2020
439:54 - two
439:55 - [Music]
439:56 - okay but password last password change
439:59 - this and password will expire when in
440:00 - January 2023 yeah it's a little bit like
440:03 - a logical thing
440:05 - but yes you can understand because we
440:07 - have not I have just used this expiry
440:10 - date
440:11 - like normally okay
440:13 - so moving forward if you want to use the
440:16 - warning like uh Suppose there are 100 is
440:19 - after 100 if possible get expired but
440:20 - you want to only use it before seven
440:22 - days then in that case you can use
440:23 - hyphen
440:25 - W option
440:29 - hyphen W and suppose you want to warn
440:31 - the user before 10 days
440:34 - and here we got an error this is capital
440:38 - W set expiration warning days to one
440:42 - days
440:43 - okay
440:46 - sudo hyphen
440:49 - W10 yeah now done
440:53 - and here you can see
440:55 - number of days that is 10 as we have
440:57 - provided here
441:00 - okay
441:01 - so in this way you can change the expiry
441:04 - date minimum days of required to change
441:05 - the password password validation warning
441:08 - days
441:09 - you can do all the things with this
441:11 - particular command and also you can do
441:12 - same things with password command also
441:14 - but yeah if you don't want to change the
441:16 - password then you can use this command
441:18 - normally like you don't need to change
441:20 - the password again and again using
441:22 - password command okay
441:23 - so you have basically two commands to to
441:26 - this same thing that is password
441:29 - and this one
441:31 - what it was chhs okay
441:35 - so that's all for today's video guys and
441:37 - I hope you liked it if you have any
441:38 - queries you can ask in the comment
441:39 - section and we will meet you in the next
441:42 - video so thank you thank you for
441:43 - watching
441:46 - now in this video we are going to learn
441:47 - about the basic command that is uh NL
441:49 - command okay so basically this is a very
441:52 - simple command okay but sometimes it's
441:54 - useful for Organics administrators in
441:56 - some cases okay so we will see the one
441:58 - use case and but before that we will
442:00 - create our own file let me give the name
442:03 - as names.txt I will write some names
442:06 - here ayush and Avinash
442:10 - and Harry
442:14 - and I will write Ron
442:17 - and again let's take some another name
442:19 - that is uh
442:22 - me okay I will use Ctrl D to save and
442:26 - now I'll just read this file names.txt
442:28 - but in this case you can see like there
442:30 - is no numbering here
442:32 - but sometimes we need to just get
442:36 - numbering like if you suppose this is a
442:38 - code
442:39 - uh if there is a code file and you need
442:42 - some numbering in that then we use this
442:45 - NL command to get the
442:48 - numbers so here you can see that one two
442:51 - three four five is listed here okay so
442:55 - suppose if I create an another file that
442:57 - is index dot X HTML
443:01 - right like body and I'll write this H1
443:06 - hello world
443:10 - and I will just close the body
443:13 - Ctrl D to save and we'll just read the
443:16 - file cat index.html and you can see this
443:18 - we are able to read but now I want the
443:21 - line number of this file like of this
443:24 - code sometimes what happens uh like uh
443:29 - we get some kind of error in a
443:31 - particular line of code so in this case
443:33 - it is useful to like debug that error
443:36 - I'll use this NL and I will just provide
443:38 - the name of the file what was it
443:40 - index.html and here you can see there
443:43 - one two three line number
443:45 - okay so I hope you got the value what
443:47 - will be the what can be the use of this
443:49 - NL command but yeah it's very simple so
443:52 - that's all for today's video guys and we
443:53 - will meet you in the next video uh with
443:56 - some amazing commands
443:58 - so that's all for today's video and
444:00 - we'll meet you next one thank you thank
444:01 - you for watching we'll meet you in the
444:03 - next video thank you now in this video
444:05 - we are going to learn about the process
444:06 - in Linux operating system okay so
444:08 - basically in this video we are going to
444:10 - cover multiple things about the process
444:11 - uh what is the process what are the
444:13 - types of process what is the PID and
444:16 - basically we will surely learn about the
444:18 - basic concept of PS command okay we will
444:20 - just take an overview but in detail we
444:22 - will make a separate video about this on
444:24 - PS command okay
444:26 - so let's start with the process if you
444:28 - are a cc student and if you are an
444:30 - operating system student also then I
444:33 - hope you are aware of process but if not
444:35 - then I am here for you guys okay so
444:37 - let's start so what is the process
444:39 - so the basic and simple definition of
444:41 - process is execution of a program
444:44 - okay
444:45 - so now what many of you will ask me what
444:48 - is the program set so program is nothing
444:50 - but uh
444:51 - buddy like whatever you write in CPP
444:54 - code or a python code or a Java code
444:56 - that is a program and whenever you
444:58 - execute that program it becomes one of
444:59 - the process
445:00 - but uh if you take a real life example
445:03 - of a process here here you will see many
445:06 - apps are there if I will open Firefox
445:08 - that will become one of the process if I
445:10 - will open this Thunderbird that will
445:12 - become one of the persons if you will
445:13 - open files that will become one of the
445:15 - process okay so as for definition
445:18 - process nothing but execution of a
445:21 - program
445:22 - when you are executing any program
445:24 - then you are simply creating one process
445:27 - in your operating system
445:29 - okay now moving forward what is a PID
445:34 - so PID is nothing but uh you can say it
445:38 - like as a process ID it is created by
445:41 - the
445:43 - updated by machine from by Linux machine
445:46 - and which what it does which unique
445:50 - identify is the process Suppose there
445:53 - are multiple processes going on in this
445:55 - Reliance operating system so to identify
445:58 - each and every process there are a
446:00 - unique PID like if you are aware of the
446:03 - primary key of bpms so it's similar like
446:05 - that it uniquely identify each and every
446:07 - process okay or if you you will get a
446:11 - real life example of account numbers so
446:13 - more One account number cannot be
446:16 - associated with the two different people
446:18 - okay so similarly PID also works like it
446:22 - uniquely identifies the particular
446:24 - process
446:25 - and also uh in Linux there are basically
446:28 - the we learn about the two types of
446:30 - processes mainly that is uh one is the
446:34 - foreground
446:36 - okay
446:37 - and the second one is the background
446:40 - process
446:42 - so as a name suggest you might have
446:45 - guessed like what is the foreground
446:46 - about the background so forward means
446:48 - whatever the process which are run by
446:50 - the user so that is the foreground
446:52 - pressure if I will do here
446:55 - uh what I can do I can just do PWD this
446:58 - is one of the process if I will do who
447:01 - am I it is sorry who am I it is one of
447:05 - the process
447:06 - so whatever the user is entering the
447:08 - command or opening any kind of
447:10 - application or anything happening that
447:12 - is a pro example of the four dot process
447:15 - and now if you will talk about the
447:17 - background process then in this case uh
447:20 - what happens the operating system has
447:23 - multiple process which runs on the
447:25 - background as for example if you will
447:26 - take an example of the Microsoft Word
447:29 - Ms word so in this what happens whatever
447:32 - you write in uh like in what we say in a
447:37 - world then if any mistake happens
447:41 - spelling mistake then what happens in
447:44 - that case like it stays as the yeah this
447:47 - is your spelling mistake it like shows
447:49 - in red color
447:50 - so how how is it possible it's possible
447:53 - as the background process running on to
447:56 - check the spelling mistake you might
447:57 - have might happen Okay so this is the
448:00 - concept of the background process okay
448:03 - so in Linux we basically we can also
448:06 - create the vaginal browser using uh I
448:08 - think some kind of ampersand
448:11 - right we use Ampersand to use the
448:13 - background process
448:14 - so yeah as you can see the two one two
448:17 - five one zero PID has been created for
448:20 - this to create to do who am I as the
448:24 - background process
448:25 - to stop this you can hit just Ctrl Z or
448:28 - Ctrl C TRL C okay so if I will do FS
448:33 - command so it will display me the
448:35 - foreground process I think
448:38 - not FS
448:40 - I will need to like install this command
448:43 - FS or FB it is I am not remembering this
448:46 - like we will cover this all those
448:48 - command and all those in our next video
448:51 - FPS there may be no not it's not there
448:55 - FP is not there uh let me remember the
448:58 - what is the concept what are the command
449:00 - for the checking format process
449:04 - yeah so FG is the command to get the
449:08 - foreground process so here like no job
449:11 - is it is showing more job okay
449:14 - so
449:15 - if I were to B3 so be there is also
449:18 - there is no background process going on
449:20 - as per this operating system
449:22 - so also we will learn about this some of
449:25 - the command like in the left lecture
449:27 - that is the PS commentary bit which
449:29 - displays of the process State okay so
449:32 - right now it is displaying me the two
449:34 - like what we say
449:35 - two processors so relative has cleared
449:38 - the screen and surely we will learn in
449:40 - detail about what is the pidtty time
449:42 - same day now next lecture but let me
449:45 - just show you the example of the
449:46 - foreground process
449:48 - so if I will open up this Firefox right
449:50 - let me just split the screen and I will
449:53 - just do not Firefox I will open this uh
449:56 - let me open Firefox
449:59 - so right now currently it's showing me
450:01 - like this processor but for more you can
450:04 - check vs iPhone e
450:06 - okay so here you can see now Firefox is
450:10 - displaying here like 12630 if I will
450:13 - close
450:16 - okay and again I will check whether it
450:18 - is paying me or not I will just check
450:20 - with it PSI funny
450:24 - okay so here you can see there is no
450:25 - Firefox but when I will open up so
450:28 - Firefox process will get added and it
450:32 - will display me the PID of that Firefox
450:35 - so now again I will just clear the
450:37 - screen and I will again I will enter
450:38 - this PSI funny so here you can see like
450:41 - now different PID is being used for the
450:43 - Firefox now to stop this process you can
450:45 - use skill command also so kill command
450:48 - and the PID that is the one
450:55 - so that's all about uh yeah guys about
450:58 - the process I hope you liked it
450:59 - particular video and surely now next
451:01 - lecture we will get to learn about the
451:03 - foreground how to get foreground
451:06 - background and the PS command
451:08 - okay so we will learn all about these
451:11 - three commands and the process States in
451:14 - our next lecture so thank you guys for
451:15 - watching this particular video and I
451:17 - hope you liked it and if you have any
451:18 - query then you can ask us in the comment
451:20 - section
451:21 - thank you guys and we'll meet you in the
451:23 - next one thank you
451:25 - hello guys now in this particular video
451:26 - we are going to learn about the PS
451:28 - command okay so basically what is a PS
451:30 - command why we use it we will discuss
451:32 - each and everything in this particular
451:35 - video okay so what is the speeds uh but
451:38 - before that we just increase the font
451:39 - size now I hope it is visible so PS is
451:42 - nothing but uh
451:44 - process State what does it mean it
451:46 - basically means it just gives us the
451:48 - information out straight of any process
451:50 - okay it will get the PID of a number the
451:55 - name of the command who is the user
451:57 - using that particular process so we will
451:59 - get each and every information on the
452:01 - process
452:01 - but before starting and going into the
452:04 - deep inside of this topic you should
452:06 - know what is the process so process is
452:08 - nothing but the execution of a program
452:11 - when I open this Firefox it will become
452:14 - one of the process when I will hit this
452:16 - particular thing it will become one of
452:17 - the possible I know it is like
452:21 - anybody command but still if I will open
452:24 - any this music rhythm box then it will
452:27 - become one of the process of process and
452:29 - nothing but the execution of a program
452:32 - okay so now let's uh
452:35 - play with this PS command so when you
452:38 - will enter the PS it basically gives you
452:40 - the uh like status of this current cell
452:43 - what are the processes running in this
452:45 - particular uh cell like this is one of
452:47 - the cell if I will open another room
452:49 - window of terminal it will give me the
452:51 - other share okay
452:54 - so here you can see we are just getting
452:56 - this PS the command which entered just
452:58 - and this is the bash is one of the like
453:01 - you can say uh shell which acts like a
453:05 - parent uh process like some other person
453:09 - use this bash to execute some kind of uh
453:12 - they have to ask okay so now let's
453:14 - basically talk about the what are the
453:16 - these four types of like what is this
453:19 - like p i d t t y okay so let's start
453:22 - with the PID
453:24 - okay so what if a PID is nothing but the
453:27 - process ID what does it mean it
453:30 - basically gives us view the unique
453:32 - identification number of a process like
453:35 - uh
453:36 - let me tell you the example of suppose
453:39 - in a family member or each and everyone
453:42 - will have the different name okay not a
453:45 - like two person will have the same name
453:48 - in a group of like family of two two are
453:51 - not two five to six members okay
453:54 - similarly this PID is there like process
453:56 - ID it uniquely identifies each and every
453:59 - process in this operating system okay it
454:02 - just gives you the particular number of
454:03 - four day data
454:05 - so that is clear to you what is the
454:07 - process ID you know moving forward that
454:09 - if TTY is not equal to terminal type it
454:11 - gives you the information about what
454:13 - type of terminal has been used by the
454:14 - user
454:16 - let me just write uh
454:18 - terminal type and yeah if you are just
454:21 - watching this video so don't just keep
454:23 - watching uh make notes also so that will
454:26 - be helpful for you for your further use
454:29 - now this is a time in learning but the
454:31 - CPU utilization time by the process so
454:34 - here it is 0 because no any other
454:36 - process using this Bash
454:39 - shell or best command okay so this is
454:43 - CPU utilization
454:48 - moving forward the CMD is nothing but a
454:51 - command which is used by like what
454:53 - commands have been applied for this
454:55 - particular process
454:57 - okay so I hope it is clear to you like
455:00 - what is PID TTY times CMD okay now
455:04 - moving forward now you will be thinking
455:07 - about why there is only two processes to
455:09 - spend because it in PS files by default
455:12 - displays the current uh process in a
455:16 - credential okay
455:18 - so to get more information about the
455:19 - different processes like on a board time
455:22 - there are multiple processor runs like
455:24 - on voting of our system so let me just
455:27 - uh enter this PSI form a so here you can
455:32 - see there are the multiple processes you
455:34 - can see like what are the commands has
455:36 - been used like
455:38 - system d
455:41 - SCSI polka diet
455:44 - okay this one colored so there are many
455:48 - processors here you can see in this
455:50 - particular
455:51 - like the screen so here you can see the
455:53 - PS command is also there uh like the PID
455:57 - 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is
456:00 - that like if the PS command fetches the
456:02 - result from this particular directory
456:05 - if you do LS then here you will get the
456:08 - information about the particular thing
456:14 - okay so uh in this particular directory
456:17 - you can see many files are there like
456:19 - like it basically fetches the particular
456:22 - information from this particular
456:24 - directory okay now we'll leave it at
456:26 - just I move it on to the root directory
456:29 - now moving forward or suppose I just
456:33 - create one process
456:35 - okay let me just create one process but
456:38 - before that I want to tell you one
456:39 - command that is the one option that PS
456:42 - hyphen C
456:43 - discount basically uh option what
456:46 - basically it does it basically uh like
456:48 - gives you the information about the
456:50 - particular process which you want okay
456:52 - in case if you want to get information
456:54 - about the particular process uh then you
456:56 - can hit the name of that particular
456:57 - process here suppose I need information
456:59 - about the Firefox okay which is now it's
457:02 - not running so I can get this so now
457:04 - what I will do I will just first clear
457:06 - the screen and I will open up this
457:07 - particular
457:08 - Firefox so now what will happen when I
457:11 - will click on this firework one process
457:13 - is getting created and then the PID is
457:16 - given to that particular process and you
457:18 - will see that in this
457:20 - like uh now you know seconds okay so
457:23 - let's wait now you can see the this
457:25 - Firefox I'll get started now I will use
457:28 - this PS hyphen C and the name of the
457:30 - person that is the Firefox
457:34 - so here you can see it like from 10
457:35 - seconds utilizing the CPU and the PID is
457:39 - given and a command is using like
457:42 - Firefox okay like you will say like you
457:46 - you are not used this phone but yeah
457:49 - let me show you if I will identify for
457:52 - the Firefox again the one Terminal 5
457:54 - will start
457:55 - okay it's showing fail to load
457:58 - yeah but some modules fit but they're
458:00 - still here you can see one Firefox
458:01 - window has been a paid if I'll just
458:03 - close it
458:05 - okay so that uh this is the first one
458:09 - okay so in this way you can see the
458:11 - information about the particular process
458:14 - and if let me just enter one more
458:17 - command if I will hit hit cat and it is
458:20 - now in the weight estate like it is just
458:23 - what we can say asking for the user
458:26 - input whatever I will write and anything
458:28 - okay it is just waiting for the user
458:30 - input so I can use this command also I
458:34 - like I will write your cat and here you
458:37 - can see the PID is assigned to this
458:39 - particular process
458:41 - okay so now what I will do uh if I want
458:44 - to just kill any process I want to just
458:49 - what we can say discard any kind any
458:51 - processor now I can use the kill command
458:53 - and I will just give pass the parameter
458:55 - as this PID
458:57 - foreign
459:00 - and then here you will see like
459:04 - let's see what happens so here you can
459:05 - say terminated the cat is now terminated
459:09 - and similarly you can do for this what
459:12 - you can say for Firefox also but before
459:14 - that uh let me just
459:17 - use hyphen a option to again view the
459:19 - all the processes so when I will clear
459:22 - not okay I will clear this account just
459:24 - do psyphenate and here you can see
459:28 - uh what is the PID 6214
459:33 - let me check whether it is visible or
459:35 - not yeah here you can see the six two
459:38 - six two one four Pi ideas
459:41 - okay what if I will kill this six to one
459:45 - for what will happen the Firefox window
459:46 - will get close okay
459:49 - so you can see now again I will use PSI
459:51 - funny
459:52 - so here you can see there is no six two
459:54 - one four and also no there is web
459:56 - content uh like what you can say web
460:00 - content command or any process is not
460:02 - displaying here as you can see in the
460:04 - previous command here while it is move
460:06 - packet you can see the web content
460:08 - process was also there so in this what
460:10 - had happened uh the 6214 PID was the
460:13 - parent process and under this process
460:16 - there are many other processes like here
460:17 - you can see the web extensions web
460:20 - content and all those things okay
460:24 - so in this way we can use this PS
460:27 - command to get the process of
460:30 - any particular uh application or any
460:33 - command okay now moving forward about
460:36 - another option that is the PS hyphen U
460:39 - okay so what is basically going to do
460:43 - what uh
460:45 - this one do so hyphenu option b is
460:48 - basically used to giving the like you
460:50 - want to get the information over to some
460:52 - particular user so if I use their iOS so
460:55 - I will get this information
460:58 - so these are the process which are being
461:00 - used by my commander
461:03 - not by my command sorry uh by me
461:06 - actually I use one of the user of this
461:08 - operating system if I have your root
461:13 - hyphen you root so as you can see the uh
461:18 - these are some processes which are being
461:20 - used by the
461:22 - dot user okay so also there were one
461:26 - more option that is the aux option PS
461:29 - command which is used for uh getting
461:31 - detailed information over the processes
461:34 - so PSI for aux displays the result in
461:37 - more or detailed format okay so here you
461:40 - can see the name of the user is like
461:44 - display like whatever user is using this
461:46 - particular
461:47 - command this particular process and the
461:50 - virtual memory utilization
461:52 - TTYL terminal type stats start when the
461:56 - process started so here you can see the
461:57 - 549 at 549 actually I had started by the
462:01 - system
462:02 - so it is displaying like on boot time
462:04 - this process has been
462:07 - started so you can see all the
462:09 - information but now here you can see
462:11 - here six one this process and now at 6
462:15 - 59 this command was done was
462:20 - used okay
462:23 - so in this way you can get the detailed
462:25 - information about uh
462:28 - your process
462:30 - okay also you can use a PS iPhone x to
462:34 - get the running processes so here you
462:36 - can see these are the running processors
462:39 - okay
462:42 - uh okay yeah this is the time command
462:45 - start okay
462:47 - so that's all for today's videos guide I
462:50 - hope you liked it and it was a very uh
462:52 - interesting thing like to get uh like uh
462:56 - what are the processes being used in
462:57 - your operating system if you learn more
463:00 - about this you will get to learn also
463:02 - more like when you will explore
463:05 - personally then obviously we get to
463:07 - learn more about this
463:09 - so that's all for this video and we'll
463:11 - meet you in the next one with another
463:12 - interesting command uh okay so maybe I
463:15 - will create video on top command after
463:17 - this so let's meet in the next one so
463:19 - thank you for watching bye
463:23 - now yesterday we are going to learn
463:24 - about the top command Okay so before
463:26 - starting this video uh first of all let
463:28 - me tell you about the what is the top
463:30 - card okay so if you have learned about
463:32 - the PS command like which gives us the
463:35 - process rates of uh like of our system
463:38 - similarly top command is also on the
463:40 - command which lies under the process
463:42 - management okay we can get the uh
463:45 - information about the different
463:46 - processes like what is the P ID of that
463:48 - particular process how much your memory
463:51 - is being used by that process okay we
463:53 - will see all the details and what are
463:55 - the users and what the users using that
463:57 - particular process so everything we are
463:59 - going to see about the in this
464:00 - particular video so we will start with
464:02 - the simple and basic command that is the
464:04 - top simple even you say top then it will
464:07 - show you the details about the other
464:09 - running different running processes by
464:11 - different users and all those things
464:12 - okay uh but before that let me just
464:14 - increase the size of my terminal I hope
464:18 - it is visible to you I'll just hit Top
464:20 - okay
464:21 - so here you can see uh the PID the what
464:24 - PID what does that mean I will tell you
464:26 - everything about the all these three
464:28 - what is these all things okay but before
464:30 - that I will need to save it like this
464:33 - the screen and I will just open command
464:35 - line also
464:37 - okay
464:38 - so here you can see what is the PID
464:42 - you just Define the process ID like
464:46 - if you don't know about PID let me tell
464:48 - you like like every device has a unique
464:51 - Mac address similarly PID is just like
464:53 - that like it is it uniquely identifies
464:56 - each processes whatever the process is
464:58 - created by the user then
465:01 - the our system assigns some PID to that
465:04 - particular process to uniquely identify
465:06 - that process simulate that is the
465:08 - process ID okay moving forward if you
465:12 - will see the user so user section just
465:15 - defines like who is the user
465:19 - using that particular
465:22 - process
465:25 - don't give attention on scaling mistakes
465:27 - okay that is not important here right
465:30 - now so what is PR pla just like private
465:35 - okay what is the priority of that
465:36 - command so the thing is that if though
465:40 - your what we say the number is lower so
465:43 - it should have the higher priority here
465:45 - you can see the zero so these processors
465:47 - have should have higher priority
465:50 - okay like you can see 20 minus 51 so it
465:53 - is you can see
465:55 - 2020 everything is there like so here
465:59 - you can write the lower the number
466:04 - higher the priority
466:06 - what does priority mean basically like
466:08 - this process like for if something
466:11 - happens to the more priority command or
466:14 - more priority process then the CPU users
466:17 - should like not CPU uses
466:20 - just think like example Suppose there
466:22 - are two processes A and B and uh B the
466:27 - priority of B is low but priority of a
466:30 - is high okay if some Interruption
466:32 - happens with hidden then a can use more
466:35 - CPU uses you can say like that okay so
466:39 - this is the defines the pr like what is
466:42 - the priority of that particular process
466:43 - of command
466:45 - and for the UK you will see here it is v
466:47 - i r t which really defines the
466:50 - virtual memory used by the task okay it
466:55 - is I think it's in KV it is in KB okay
466:59 - so that's why it's showing like bigger
467:02 - number
467:03 - okay so it is virtually you can suppose
467:07 - not virtually virtual memory
467:09 - used by the task okay
467:13 - moving forward what is this
467:16 - so this is uh what we can say I think it
467:20 - is the physical RAM yeah the command
467:23 - used like whatever the process is
467:25 - running like how much RAM this is
467:28 - particularly using like this particular
467:29 - process how much RAM it is using so it
467:32 - is also in the KB
467:34 - this data is in KB okay and moving
467:37 - forward if you will talk about the fhr
467:40 - so shr is nothing but a shared memory it
467:42 - also in KB
467:44 - okay and then the percentage CPU
467:47 - percentile memory time and or the other
467:49 - option you can see here uh where it is
467:52 - time plus command all those things like
467:56 - this is this uh this shows the
467:59 - uh which command uh like after entering
468:03 - which command this process is running
468:04 - okay
468:05 - so here you can see all those things
468:07 - okay if I will just
468:10 - yeah wait a minute
468:11 - what I will do first I will just stop
468:14 - this stop command
468:16 - and I will again run that top command
468:19 - and I will show you one okay so here you
468:21 - can see the top command is running
468:23 - okay like different processes coming
468:26 - here and there okay now what I will do
468:28 - uh but command is not visible let me
468:31 - just string create this one yeah now you
468:34 - can see the command is visible
468:36 - if I do Ctrl alt T and I will hit this
468:38 - Firefox
468:39 - okay so this command what it will do it
468:42 - will just create a new process okay and
468:44 - then again you can see here if I will
468:47 - hit enter in that particular terminal
468:49 - then Firehouse will come up there and
468:51 - some PID will be assigned to that so
468:54 - here you can see which command is this
468:56 - Firefox and the particular time you can
468:58 - see how much CPU uses per memory plus
469:02 - virtual memory
469:04 - okay and RAM also and who is the user I
469:07 - use is the user and the PID is four
469:10 - seven nine zero
469:12 - okay
469:13 - so in this way this particular
469:15 - popcorn Works which displays you the
469:19 - particular information about any
469:21 - particular
469:22 - process okay
469:24 - so now what we have to do uh if you want
469:27 - to just what you can see you can say
469:30 - like if you want to get information
469:31 - about the particular user like so let's
469:35 - suppose I want to get information about
469:37 - the IU shooter what process being used
469:39 - by that particular user so I can use
469:42 - those command also okay but before
469:44 - moving to that uh I will just tell you
469:47 - one thing like if you want to kill any
469:49 - process while using top command how you
469:51 - can do it you have to just in this
469:53 - particular terminal
469:54 - uh let me just increase this one okay
469:58 - uh
470:00 - where it is uh
470:03 - I think this one
470:06 - yeah this one
470:08 - Firefox was running Firefox pied is what
470:11 - 4790. now what we have to do let me just
470:13 - hit k so when you will enter K so here
470:17 - you can see PID to Signal default P ID
470:19 - is one six two two so here you can do it
470:22 - uh like enter the PID of the process
470:25 - which you want to kill or which you want
470:26 - to close so if I will search for Firefox
470:31 - I think it was four seven nine zero
470:35 - okay so let me just
470:40 - shape like this
470:42 - okay uh yeah here you can see four seven
470:46 - nine zero is some process
470:50 - let me just get this one
470:54 - the weight of it
470:56 - so four seven nine zero not able to see
470:59 - 479 here you can see fourth of manager
471:01 - is this one so I'll just hit K and I
471:04 - will write enter 4790 enter and here you
471:07 - can see the what happens when you kill
471:10 - the command uh it's not command can you
471:13 - kill the process then you need to give
471:15 - the particular signal so in this case
471:16 - I'll hit 15 so
471:19 - you can see like Firefox has been closed
471:21 - and also here you can see the terminated
471:24 - okay
471:25 - so while I entered the p uh 15 because
471:29 - like it's kind of a signal which we use
471:32 - with the kill command okay
471:34 - so we will talk about the kill command
471:36 - in some another particular video okay
471:38 - now moving forward what uh I was telling
471:40 - about to get information about the
471:42 - process used by some particular user so
471:45 - how you can see you like how you can do
471:47 - that what you have to do you have to
471:48 - just need to talk
471:51 - hyphen U and the name of the user ayush
471:55 - and now here you can see all the
471:57 - processes which are being used by this
471:59 - particular user oh I think multiple
472:01 - processes are being used
472:03 - okay so in this way you can get
472:06 - information about particular uh user if
472:08 - you want to like if you work in the
472:10 - corporate world and you get like other
472:13 - units administrator then in that case it
472:15 - will be very useful like to know like
472:18 - which user is using what kind of
472:19 - processes when something happens when
472:21 - you can see
472:22 - okay and also there are multiple things
472:25 - like uh you can if you will hit Z then
472:28 - the running process color will get
472:30 - converted into this so what we what red
472:33 - color and if you will do press uh like
472:36 - what you can say if you press C
472:39 - then you will get the
472:41 - path of particular command like go for
472:44 - which in which part that command is
472:45 - particular running so here you can see
472:47 - the genome cell is in user bin directory
472:51 - and many more things here it is okay
472:55 - so that's all for today's videos guys I
472:57 - hope you liked it and if you have any
472:58 - queries then you can ask us in the
472:59 - comment section so thank you thank you
473:01 - for watching and I will meet you in the
473:02 - next video thank you
473:04 - now in this video we're going to learn
473:05 - about the kill command Okay so already
473:07 - we have covered the PS command and the
473:10 - top command okay so in this video we're
473:12 - going to learn about how we can kill a
473:14 - particular process or you can see the
473:15 - how we can terminate a particular
473:17 - process sometimes what happens in our
473:19 - case like you open a Firefox or any
473:22 - application and it becomes unresponsive
473:24 - okay and at that time you cannot access
473:26 - that application and you cannot use that
473:28 - particular application
473:29 - so in that case you need to just you
473:32 - want to just terminate that process or
473:34 - close that application anyhow okay
473:37 - so for that purpose we can use the kill
473:40 - command and also you can normally you
473:42 - can also use that kill command okay to
473:43 - close any application or download that
473:45 - particular process so how you can do it
473:47 - so there is a separate command in our
473:49 - Linux system that is a kit
473:52 - okay so kill is the command you can use
473:55 - okay so there are the many signals
473:59 - provided by this particular command you
474:01 - can get two single using the kill hyphen
474:04 - L option
474:05 - so here it will list all the signals
474:07 - which you can use but mostly used signal
474:10 - is the
474:12 - 15 this one signal terminate and also
474:15 - you can use the signal kill signal kill
474:18 - okay so these are the signals which are
474:20 - used mostly by the kill command to kill
474:23 - particular process so
474:25 - to demonstrate you
474:28 - I will just
474:30 - open up the Firefox using this terminal
474:34 - I will hit fire Firefox
474:38 - and Firefox will start and I will just
474:41 - enter the PS
474:44 - and psyphen a to show all the process
474:48 - so here you will see the Firefox PID
474:53 - that is
474:55 - 8796 okay so I have got the PID of
475:00 - Firefox okay so with the help of PID I
475:03 - can
475:05 - terminate this particular process so PID
475:07 - is 8796 okay so but there is many uh
475:11 - ways to terminate particular process you
475:13 - can just terminate that process using
475:15 - the PID as well using third signal and
475:18 - the name of that like signal term Single
475:22 - kill and also without signal so I will
475:25 - just show you each and everything okay
475:28 - so you can just to kill
475:31 - that is PID is 8796
475:34 - okay using PID or you can just do hyphen
475:37 - 50.
475:39 - okay that is 8796 so what it will do to
475:42 - just kill that particular process that
475:43 - you can see the terminated okay so also
475:47 - you can do how you can do it but now I
475:49 - will not open the uh
475:51 - Firefox I will just use CAD commands at
475:54 - home
475:55 - okay and I will just use PS cat to check
475:59 - the pad is 9405 okay so here I can use
476:04 - kill hyphen Sig signal and I will use
476:08 - Tom
476:09 - and I will just enter the
476:11 - PID number that is a 9405 and hit enter
476:15 - and you can see the that particular uh
476:18 - process terminated
476:20 - and also you can do like this also like
476:23 - a size Z without Sid you can also
476:27 - use this command so I will again use
476:29 - this one and I will first check the what
476:32 - is the process of CAD because process ID
476:35 - changes again and again that is 9417
476:37 - this time and I will use 9417 and you
476:41 - can see the process terminated okay so
476:43 - in this way you can use the kill command
476:45 - okay now uh now let's use some another
476:48 - signal also so if I will use psyphen l
476:52 - not PS sorry
476:55 - kill iPhone help
476:58 - so I will use this one kill so let me
477:02 - check how it works I will use this so
477:04 - kill hyphen 9 and the process name that
477:09 - is the cat
477:10 - no not process name
477:13 - PID
477:16 - so 9431
477:19 - kill hyphen 9
477:22 - 431 hit enter and here you can see the
477:25 - process is killed
477:26 - okay so in this way you can use the
477:29 - skill command to terminate any process
477:30 - or kill any process so if that process
477:33 - and responsive of that any application
477:35 - is on this point so in that case you can
477:37 - use this particular command
477:39 - okay so that's all for the today's video
477:41 - guys and I hope you liked and if you
477:42 - have any queries you can ask us in the
477:44 - comment section okay
477:46 - so I will meet you in the next video
477:47 - thank you thank you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the channel this is ayush and from today we are going to start our Linux Series so today in this tutorial we are going to cover the installation of Linux operating system that is we are going to install basically Ubuntu and we will see the basic Comfort concept of virtualbox what is virtualbox and why we will use it okay so let's start with the virtual box so virtualbox is nothing but one kind of software that we use to run different operating system in our main host okay so our main host here means that our one this operating system that that this one which I am using right now that is Windows 11 okay so in this operating system we are going to use another operating system with the help of virtualbox okay I hope that is clear to you like what is a virtualbox okay so basically we will uh install Ubuntu OS but before that you will need to first of all install virtualbox so how you can do it you have to just go on this particular website virtualbox.org and you have to click on this download virtualbox 6.1 and then according to your host you can download it if I hope it's windows so you can just click on Windows host okay this will download the installation file and actually I have already installed it I've already downloaded this file so I'll just cancel this okay and let me go here you can see I have this file okay so what you have to do you have to just click double click on it and it will just ask for the administration permission you have to just click yes and then it will start uh installation actually I have already installed virtualbox that's why it's coming like it first of all I will remove it okay let me remove it first then again it will install okay it will take little bit of time don't worry for it okay uh we believe it uh for but till now I pause the video okay so guys my virtualbox has been already uh like uh uninstalled now again I will click on this particular file and just hit on yes it will start uh okay so just you have to click next then you have to make sure all the options are to tick mark you have to click yes 10 yes then install and it will take just the approx 5 minute of time not more than that okay uh first of all it be let it be installed and yeah it's installed I think after that I will tell you though about the installation part of the Ubuntu operating system so one operating system is nothing but the next is true okay so I will cover all that point in the next video and here you can see the uh like virtualbox is installed and just click on finished and the virtualbox will come up okay so here you can see my virtualbox has been loaded and don't worry about these files because I had already these files with me so don't worry about it I will tell you the installation part of Ubuntu operating system okay so what you have to do now you have to go on the you have to just search Ubuntu okay nothing else then you have to just go on this download section or you can go buy this ubuntu.com download and here you can see the one to desktop you have to click on it and then make sure the version of I am using I'm also using this uh current version you have to just hit download okay and the download will start and also I have already downloaded this file also and you can see the file size is approx 3.4 GB okay so if you have WiFi then it's good if you're not then you will need X some extra on it okay I have already installed it so I will just cancel it you can see the file here one two desktop same version okay 2022.04 so what I will do now uh this is my virtualbox I will just hit new I will just name my OS I will name it Ubuntu OS and make sure or don't change it now for like don't change the location as maybe you can face some error okay and here the type is Linux and this is all default okay you will get the same here just click on next make sure you provide the size a more than 4 GB at least and if you uh 4 M sorry if you have a ram of laptop approx 4 GB Ram then make sure like you provide half of it otherwise your laptop will hang okay so now click on next create a virtual hard disk click on next dynamically allocated next and here you can provide the size which you want to provide to that particular OS I will provide Max to Max 50 GB okay you can also provide it approx according to your exercise okay I will just hit on create as you can see my machine has been created and now what I will need to do I will need to click on next so the total installation I think it takes approx of 2025 minutes or maybe 30 minutes sometimes and here you can see you have to just select that particular file I will just click on this and then click on ADD I will select my file here just click on open and then choose okay and you have selected that ISO file now you have to just hit a start okay so it will take some time and then you have to just sorry click enter hit enter and it will take some time of approx five minutes okay uh I will pause the video and when the another screen come I will resume okay now here you can see guys uh this window has come up now it will ask for the installation so let's wait mapoxally takes 30 minutes and case foreign and again the same thing like keyboard layout to what you want so I need English so I will just hit on continue then again continue it's taking much time and then you have to just hit on install now foreign then like my reason is in India so it's been already selected you can also choose according to you I'm just hitting continue now you have to provide a username so you can my username will be I choose as I use and my password make sure you remember your password because we will need it again and again so you have to just make sure you have selected this option to cover my password to login okay then click on continue and now it will like copy all the files and install the month OS okay so I will pause this video after the complete installation I will be back okay foreign has been almost copied okay now the installation will start okay so it will also take app of 5 to 10 minute of time now guys you can see like at approx half of our OS has installed so it's just unpacking all the liabilities and then retriving files storing so you will learn more about uh operating system like how will be the file structure what are the commands that we will use in our playlist okay so let it be complete foreign I think different softwares and here also you can see like uh this while installing it's showing everything you need for the office all these things you can check okay here we will get the Firefox web browser and the photo applications we will get yeah we'll Spotify so at this OS will be little bit different for the windows users uh like who are using Windows from his childhood or our childhood okay so this will be basically some kind of command line based thing so as you will get some realtime skills okay like that will be helpful in the corporate also or if you want to go in the domain of cyber security there is also need of this Linux OS so that would be very helpful for you so uh let it installer I will be right back after the complete installation so now you can see guys like now it will install as there was uh some kind of packages it so it was installing uh just before I resume the video now it should not take much time it will take I think a little bit of time it will just though whatever the package that has installed by the system then it will just unpack all the all those things so let's wait for it don't know how much time will it take foreign Linux headers okay nice it should not take much time I don't know why it's taking much time packingness headers so okay preparing now it's preparing so guys now you can see our installation has been completed and this is the like information box you will get after the com after the successful installation now it's asking to restart now so I'll just hit on restart now then it will ask for the whatever the username and the password which you have entered at the time installation then that those things you will need to enter okay so it is asking for the removing solution because okay I have to just hit enter so you will also need to hit enter okay so now it wouldn't start and after that uh I will tell you something important uh like as you can see over the this size of that particular schema is only too much uh but uh I know like we don't like to do on like the small window so we will check how we can increase the particular screen size to full screen okay so first of all we will need to login into the system then we will need to do some changes in it then we can easily uh go into the full screen mode foreign as compared to like uh old install system so let's wait for it now here you can see uh now your username whatever you have entered so I had entered the name I use I will just click on it and I will need to just hit the password okay then hit enter it will take little bit of time to configure everything foreign system okay so it will ask for some kind of this thing if you want to link this with the Google account then you can go otherwise you can just skip it okay that's not mandatory to it to do it and then also click on next and if you want to install some kind of software into this Ubuntu OS then you can do it otherwise you can also click on done okay so now you can see uh this is our OS uh which is installed successfully but uh you can see the screen size is too small for the use okay so for that what we will need to do we will need to first of all uh like um let me do one thing I will just uh oh I will just power off the window you can do by the control alt then this terminal will open and you have to just enter into one command power off now your system has been successfully installed or just we have to do one thing like we have to do the full screen mode okay so we will just go in the setting and then again in the display and you have to do it full to 128 MB and then you have to just enable the 3D acceleration and make sure your storage is it's showing empty but what we will know we will need to do just add optical drive and we will just add this one we both just addition.iso will choose it and then on the empty what we will do we'll just do right click and we will remove this particular attachment and then you have to go click on OK and here you can see where we box there's something okay now what we will do we will just restart our system foreign password not username only password you will need to wait okay yeah now we can just hit the password and then let's show the screen buddy yes now you will just scroll down then you you will see this so V box gas okay so you have to just click on it and then here you have to just hit the right click and then open in terminal and here we have to just hit this command dot slash auto run dot sh okay so this is uh what's coming so auto catalog is being downloaded oh no I don't want this right now just close button this is basically a cell script file that we will run okay to set enter and it will ask for the Authentication well then again now it will install some some files okay then after the complete installation again we will need to restart our this machine and then you can easily uh set the particular um like we will get the whole screen okay uh till now let's do some kind of Surfing this OS so here you can see the Firefox is there and this is Thunderbird mail we can use as a mail this is the file system new Rhythm box I think it's some kind of music player okay so here you can see the play install the GCC make Power package from distribution okay it will install it so you don't have to do anything now here you can see an economy will not be present until somebody has started okay uh I will need to hit enter I think yeah just hit enter and again one thing will come up here then after that we will need to hit enter okay just wait for it yeah now it's been done okay now what we will need to do uh we will need to just restart the system you can hit the command reboot foreign foreign I think it's not done let me check from here this is the way box guest Edition what is there put it all to the same thing now it should happen okay let me show the screen bro yeah now done okay so what I just said that I just write control and then press F okay when you will do it you will go in the full screen again you will then do the right control and then have F then you will get this the whole skin now it looks nice now on pasting Ctrl alt you can get the terminal on or by just hitting here now I will just close it and I think here you can see activity is and the address and here the all application which you can see and then from here you can just click on the terminal and now the terminal will open up okay or the shortcut is Ctrl alt so here I'm just entering the command who am I this is the basic Linux command so here you can see it's showing the name as ayush okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you have a successfully install the Linux operating system or you can so Ubuntu OS in your PC using virtualbox so that's all for today so do like share and subscribe programming knowledge and I'll meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching so now here is our Linux system which we had already installed yesterday if you have not watched the previous video then please go and watch that video because without this uh you will not be able to follow us okay uh if you have already installed it it's fine if you have not installed then you can go for it okay so now what we have to do we have to first off uh learn the one of the basic command like LS command but before that you should have some familiarity with this uh like environment about Linux environment like here you can see the browser web browser mail here you can see the files that just like in our Windows system there is the this one file explorer similarly here is also that thing okay you can access the different folders documents and then downloads music whatever thing you will download from web browser it will get downloaded in this particular video uh in this particular sorry uh download for directory and here is some public folder and here is nothing okay and also you will get the trash videos pictures all these things okay so these are the all things which you will get so now what we have to do we you will you will need to first of all open up the terminal uh you can go from here and then you can click on Terminal okay but also there is a shortcut for opening the terminal is the control alt T okay so now I will cut this and you can just hit Ctrl alt and then so it will like open one of the terminal so this is our terminal and on this particular thing we will work so let me maximize it I hope it is visible to you okay straight amount uh okay now it should be visible to you guys okay so uh the First Command which we will uh learn about in this video is the ls command so what is LS command first we will talk about this what is LS command uh just think about LSS is nothing but the list the content so we use the ls command to list the contents of a particular directory okay if you are both you are in our desktop directory so you want to get the all what are the files what are the directors in that particular desktop if you want to get it so you will use a simple command that is called as LS command okay so what we will do we'll just hit LS okay so now I am in the home folder and where you can see the desktop documents downloads music pictures and all these things okay so what I will do for the purpose of showing you I will just open up the files in my here on my screen I will try to minimize it okay yeah here you can see I am already on the home directory okay from here you can see also uh I hope it's feasible let me minimize the size of this particular window and yeah now here you can see uh this is the home and the same content which we are getting also here okay so this is the uh main purpose of the command LS so this is the basic work which it does like it just list the content of that particular um folder or particular directory in which you are present so if I will go in the desktop and here you can see one file has been created desktop so now what we will do we will just here click on open it terminal okay and then now you can see where are you you are in the desktop now here when you will do LS so here also you can see you are getting that particular directory test as it is okay so I hope you got the idea about how the ls Works what are the main person purpose behind this okay so now what we will I will talk about with you is the slacks or you can see say the options or arguments so there are many options or arguments which we use with the ls command okay so I will use uh show you the first one is L hyphen L that is small l so this is the basically the format or you can say the Syntax for the like commands like there will be command name then hyphen then the whatever the option which you want to provide with it so what with this command will basically do hyphen L just stands for the long format okay it will show you the all the files and write in the long format so I will just hit enter and now you will learn a thing like wow what what is this now I will get a bit of confused about it okay so let me tell you about these things like these are these are the some permissions okay uh like read write execute uh there will be a separate video on this permission because this is a very important topic okay and then there is a user's new username group name this is the file size and the dates and all in the last modification date time so the I had created The One desktop folder at 153 am so that's why it is showing at uh this time 153 okay so now what I will do I will create one folder in documents okay and here I will do new folder and here I will give it the name as uh LS command okay here you can see the documents folder and in that we have a LS command now what I will do I will just again hit the LSI funnel here now you can see the last modification time of that particular uh directory document is 217 and here also you can say it's now r280 now okay I hope you got the idea about this hyphen L format like it basically displays you the result in the long format okay so this is the main purpose of this hyphen L flag now let me talk you uh about some other flags like H flag okay so H plug basically uh does the like it will show you the format in the human readable format okay like as you can see this is a 409 so you will not give what is this basically it is the file size okay and if I will do hyphen H then you will get us some difference uh let me create one more terminal so that you can differentiate between both the result okay how many eyes at uh okay my battery is low okay now what I will do here LS hyphen l hyphen H okay we can use the separate uh as a separate flag or we can just combine both together I will show you after this okay don't worry about it so here now you can see this is showing me the humidity formula what is 36 it is 36 KB and then 4 kb4 kb4 KB this is the size of all like directories there is a some basic concept about it I will tell you later uh in that particular video when we will come across with the more description about these things like it isn't basically related to the hard Links of soft link kind of concept in Linux okay so as this is a beginner purpose video so will not cover this at this time otherwise you will get confused okay so uh we I had used LS iPhone H okay so now what I will do I'll just combine both things okay hyphen LH as you can see there will be no difference and it will also know uh knows like it will also not provide me like this command is basically like on valid or anything else so you can see we can write like this also or we can write like this also so now uh one more command you will need to know the clear command what this phone will do I hope you guys did right this will just clear all this screen okay I will just hit enter and yeah boom you got clear okay now uh let's move about some other flags which we will use the simple flag is also the a slab what it does you will uh will understand like it will list all the files and directory okay uh the hidden files also it will show us and here you can see we are getting the biggest bash history logout Dash RC file all these files which we are we are getting here okay now let me show you here also so you will get idea about it how it's working you can go here and it should be somewhere like hidden files uh yeah here you can see the so hidden files is unchecked now we will check it and then yeah boom you can see the same result as we have by RC and here is also the without batch RC file and other some files which are present here also okay so for now I am again unchecking it so it should be simple okay so now uh we can combine The Hyphen L option with this also like air we are getting the same thing but what in the long format okay like this is the same permissions number some kind of and I use I use this is the username and group and root root is the root user who like we will get about this what is root and all these things when you when we will learn about the user creation things in Linux okay so uh I hope you got it the hyphen L option also okay uh let me tell you one more uh flag which are important here I like uh hyphen LD okay uh what we will do in this when we will uh combine the L with the directive distance for directory and one to get the details of the let's get documents directory yeah now here we can see you you are getting the details for a specific directory that is documents okay and here is the same thing that we were getting earlier like uh you can match it with it like documents and also you can see the permissions users group size and the last modification time okay this is the LD so these are the some basic uh Flags which you can use with the ls command okay and that's all for today and also if you want more like practice on it you can go here also on uh tryhackme.com like this is a platform on which there is a Linux tutorials or something you can say uh wait a minute oh yeah I think I got it here um in the long that should be in the learning path or somewhere else yeah Linux fundamentals okay if you want to uh more indepth knowledge or you want to practice some your skills then you can go on this platform also okay so uh that's all for today and I hope you understood about the ls command if you they see it Linux just like about your practice if you do more practice you will get more family familiar with it like uh like when I had a starter it was like what is this thing and what is this terminal I was get scared of this domain but when you start practicing with it when you play with this then you will get a height about OS you can understand it okay so that's all for today and uh please like share and subscribe our Channel and hit the like button if you like this okay so thank you for watching and we will meet you in the next video thank you thank you so much so now today in this video what we are going to learn so basically we are going to learn about one of the more basic command that is CD command which means the change directory okay so if it stands for change directory command so what we will do today we will learn about how we can change our directory from one to another okay now what I have to do I have to just increase the font size for you guys it should be visible uh I think yeah it's okay it's visible it should be and in the next video in window what I will do I will just open this file manager for your reference to show you how the things are working okay now this is our home directory here you can see home okay and right now we are also in the terminal we are on the home table directory what we will do we will do this just LS okay so here you can see we are getting different files like different directory directories desktop downloads pictures snap videos documents and so on okay so now today in this video what we are going to learn about the CD command okay CD what it basically means series also stands for change directory what it will do it will just change your directory okay now our current direct is what it is our home okay we are at home we want to go on the desktop okay how we will do it so if there are the two ways in which we can perform this action like first one is that we that is basically a concept of Linux so that's why I'm telling you uh that is of I think one of these is absolute path name and the second is reality path names okay so first we will talk about the absolute path I mean absolute path names what we do we just provide the whole path okay uh wait a minute I will provide the desktop path okay I want to go move to into the desktop directly what I will do CD desktop this is basically what absolute path names okay so I will just hit enter and now you can see I am in the desktop now what I will do I will do LS okay so here you can see the file which uh this is also one directive in which we had created in the last video okay so this is the files of the desktop directory okay so this is the like one of the way in which we can do it like we call it as the absolute path names and now the next is reality path now what is this so basically relative patterns works for a particular notation that is thought then or you can say double dot okay so what I have to do now I have to go back now I am in the desktop I have to go back okay like from let me cancel it like from here you can see I'm in the tag uh right now we are here at the test okay in the desktop directory now what I have to go I have to go back in the where in the home directory so for this what I will do I will just do CD dot dot again back we are back okay we are in this particular window or get this in this particular window you can say like in the home directory now there is also one more command uh which you you've learned in this video like that is PWD what it does it just shows you the present working directly so our present working directory is home slash is because you I use is one of the user of this particular OS that's why it's showing I would like whenever you will create multiple users then you will get your own particular home directory in which you will create your separate files and folders or anything which you want to create okay that's why it's showing home I use now what I will do I will move into the documents directory okay documents okay now now I am here documents so now what I will do I will just do PWD so here you can see we are getting again the same present working at this CD like home I use documents okay I hope you got the idea about how PWD is working how documents is working now what I have to do I have to just go back one more directory back one activate dot dot okay we are back now I have a loop it WT again we are at the home and ayush we're at the home directory now we'll just hit uh clear button and here what we will do we will create our own structure here you can see LS command is one of the folder and uh I will open up this folder and I will try to create again new folder that is S2 okay now what we will do we have to come directly in the LS command folder so how we can do it first we first of all we will do LS okay we got the list of the already active which are present in the home directory now where I have to go I have to go in the documents directory so I will do CD documents I am just entering uh like after typing the Duc and then you if you will hit tab then automatically it will like like this document okay then after documents where we have to go like now I am in documents now I will do LS we are on the this documents for directory and here is the directory that is LS command now what I have to do LS command okay now where we are we are in the document slash LS command now what I will do I will do LS this is we are in the S2 not in the test two like this is the content of this particular directory like LS command now I I will do I will again go back and go into the test two okay well let me increase that width so it should be clear to you okay now what I will do I will just hit PWD with WD means present working right so my present working right is home I use documents LS command and the test two okay now what we will do we will go back one by one CD dot dot We Are One director pack CD dot dot again one direct back CD dot dot Again One Direction back now we are where we are we are in the home directory now what I will do I will just give the whole path okay documents slash LS command slash test in this way you can also go in the like your final destination act like providing the whole path in a single string okay now what I will do PWD so here you can see the whole path like this is same as this this one like when we move went to that directly like one by one okay when we were doing one by one then we were all getting these results and also when we are doing like in a single string then also we are getting a steam result I hope you got the idea about how the CD change direct working okay let me clear this now there is also one more shortcut to go directly in the home directory that is CD this tilt it will directly go into the home directory that is LS okay or we when we will do PWD you will get that particular window okay so I hope you got this uh how the things are working and this is all about the CD like change directory command Okay so it stands for change directory okay I hope it is clear now so we will meet in the next video with uh like we will create some folders and files and all these things we will talk about in the next video so that's all for today's video and thank you for watching so we'll meet the next one okay thank you thank you for watching so mkdr command is nothing but uh like it just stands for the make directory okay what by directory means like in Linux we basically uh call directly but in the other uh operating system like Windows what we call it as a folder so director is something basically like a folder you can uh like you can say like that okay direct is like a folder so now what I was talking about uh to create a directory so what we will do uh we'll uh take uh like uh ah structure to create a directory okay so let me draw a structure for you this is a website where you can easily like draw any kind of structure or whatever you want okay I want to create a blank diagram create okay save it anywhere I don't care save oh sorry test okay here it is now what we will do uh we will create first uh University okay then in that University we will create students okay and then we will create fatalities and then we will create uh you can call it as a workers okay and in the student section we will create a like we will name it one of the student like ayush okay are something like XYZ okay and similarly in the faculties uh you want to give it as some kind of instead of Faculty here I will try to give it a subject okay now here we will write Linux networking okay and we will leave the workers has a blank okay so we will follow this pattern to create a directive so this will be helpful too like when you play with it you will get a better idea like and also you will get a practice about the CD command that we have learned earlier in the last video okay so uh how will we proceed I will try to just uh off the screen I hope it should be visible to you okay yeah now it is visible and now what we will do I will clear the screen and we will do just LS okay so here what we have we have just desktop downloads pictures snap and these things okay and I will try to hit just PW to PWD we are in where we are in the home directory now what I will do I will create a first University directory okay so I'll get m k d i r and then I will write University okay I have created University let's say tell us okay so here you can see uh we have got the university directory now what I have to do in the University I have to create this student's directory subject and workers okay first what we will do we will create these directors one by one then after the after the whole this completion of the whole diagram sorry what we will do we will create these three directory like in a row okay in a single command we will do it okay so let's do it first single single okay so I will first go into the university directory CD and then we will do LS that is nothing what I will do I will create a student directory students okay then I will create when you kill upper key then you will get the previous command okay then I will create subject then I will create workers okay so now I will do LS so here you can see we have got the three directories now what I have to do I have to create a more director then uh students so here is one thing also I want to tell you about like here students in this students uh you will see the SS Capital but when I will try to hit s with the small then what happens no such value why because this is a case sensitive in Linux it follows questions activity okay that's why it happens now what I will do c capital is then tab now tab okay restaurants now where we are we are in the student directory when I will do PWD what we will get will get the exact location where we are okay so now what we have to do first of all I want to clear this whole thing okay now what I will do I will create two directors with name ayush and with name uh Ankit okay LS are you think it has been created okay now what I will do I have to go back in the subject directory so how we can do it we will do just CD dot dot remember in the last video we talked about this CD dot dot and here now where I am I am in the University when I will do LS I will have the access of subject and workers also what I will do now I will just do CD subject okay and then again we are in the subject directory now what I have to do I have to create two directors Linux and then networking okay now I'll do LS here you can see Linux and networking has been created and in the workers directory we don't have to write anything or we don't have to create any kind of folder in it okay so this is the basically like simple process of creating files and directors in the Linux and now I will tell you some like ah means I will do like creating these whole things in a single command okay not whole things but yeah this one and this one I will try to create okay so what I will do uh I will go in the home directory again clear now and I will show you here also like how in the file system it will look like whether it is there or not okay uh yeah here you can see University directors here in the University we have student subject workers and in the students we have ayushananket and back and in the subject we have Linux and networking and now what I will do I will just delete this directory okay uh from here I can delete okay to delete the directories and all I will tell you this in the next video okay otherwise everything will get mixed up okay so now if I will do LS here so there is no University folder is there now what I will do I will just create a university folder uh sorry University okay now university has been created I will move into this directory and now I have to do you know I have to create a student subject workers so what I can do mkdir students okay space subject I think spelling mistake is there something okay yeah subject and then I'll get Workers boom now let's hit LS then you will get something yeah so here what we are doing in the same in the single command we are creating three directories or you can create multiple Direction uh it all depends on you how much you want to create okay and now what I have to do in the students we have to create ayush and x y z so how I will do mkdir and students sorry sorry uh okay sorry for it uh I I'm strict entered enter okay this is LS okay now what I have to do I will go in the students directory students okay now what I will do I will create again the both iusion and get like before I send again okay unless same okay so this is the like one way to create multiple directories at in a single command okay so I hope you got it how you can create multiple directories okay I'm not going to show you for the subject like it will be then you will get bored like I am like displaying you same things again and again okay so now let me tell you something more interesting things okay I will clear and then go back into the home directory clear everything LS and now what I will do now I want to tell you some more Concepts like uh the options which we can use with the hyphen P command Okay so the first option which I want to show you like hyphen V that stands for verbose so when we will do this mkdir hyphen V it will tell you the like whether directory has been created or not okay so let me let me create uh like um uh what anything Linux okay here you can see create a directory Linux again uh let me tell you again I want to create same directive let's see what happens here you can see cannot create a Linux file exist what if I remove iPhone B whether it stays displaying or not the same error okay it displays the same here okay so but when we use hyphen way it will tell you the status like whether direct is created or not okay I hope it's clear hyphen B and in the next uh we will talk about hyphen P also what it does hyphen p uh like when we suppose we want to create a directory in which like University in the University students and then in the student we want ayush okay I usually want only okay so how we can do it uh but before uh that I will need to sorry I will not delete that okay I'll let it be I will get some more uh extra scenario like uh let's create some kind of like uh um Sun and with sun let's create a hair father and then we will create obviously grandfather okay or we can go reverse also because I I think I have created in the reverse motion should be in the last okay grandfather okay now what I will do mkdir hyphen P option and Sun slash father smash grandfather okay so basically this command what it will it will create the like in the sun directory you will get further in the further directory you will get the grandfather but if you will not use hyphen P option then what will happen like we will not be able to create a directory like if one father does not exist then it will not create grandfather okay but if like if it exists and father exist okay sorry I got a little bit confused here let me first of all create this one okay LS should be sun directory Sun LS father LS okay so what I was trying to say like when we will use hyphen P option if Sun father is not created then it will be get created automatically but when we will not use hyphen P then it will not get created like uh let me go back and now what I will do I will try to create mkdr test one slash Test 2 slash test three it should be like in test one there should be test one test two there should be test three here you can see cannot create directory okay no such file your directors there okay so I hope you got the like actual role of the hyphen P option okay now this is not a more uh big deal if you want to if you play more and more with this command you will get familiar with this whole Linux environment okay that's not a big deal now the next thing is hyphen M option okay what it does this is nothing but mode okay mode or we can say permissions like uh uh till now we have not covered the permission section in Linux like it is another concept when the another another video will come up on this concept like read write execute all these things but still I tell you like if the if the person will have the read read permission then that user can read the file if he has right then he can write the file or execute then he can execute that file but if he has all the threatened he can do anything rewrite execute all okay so how we can do this mkdr hyphen M and we provide a equal to suppose we want to provide r w x all to the one directory that is test IOP test is not there yes distributed now what I have to do LSI funnel you can see here the permission of all these things and here you can see where it is test so r w x r w x r w three dot execute there is something like rwx for users and another this RW is for group and another this rwx is for other portions okay so when we will do test in this when we will go in this directory we can do any kind of operation MKT sorry mkdir test blah blah blah okay we can do anything but now what I will do I will try to create a uh One Directory with only read operations okay so let's see what happens whether we are able to create or not anything in that particular direct whether we have a permission or not so what I will do mkdir hyphen m a equal to I want to just read operation we can only read read and I will create test three let's do unless iPhone L and now you can see in test 3 we have only read permission to everyone users also groups also and others I think others have not any permission okay here okay now I will go in the test three test three so as you can see permission denied we don't have X access to that folder so now who can access this folder there is also one user in the Linux buddy root only root can access okay uh so that's all about this in this video like mkdr command so I hope you liked it and please like share subscribe our YouTube channel and now we will meet in the next video with another basic command like in the next video we'll basically talk about the whole deck which we have created we will then again we will create some directory then we will delete it with the director is empty then what what we can do if it is not empty then how we can delete it so these are all the things which we'll cover in the next video so that's all for today and we will meet in the next one thank you thank you so much for watching foreign so now what I will do I will create a one more directory I will start by creating a directory mkdir ayush okay I have created ayush and now what I have to do uh I have to again create a more directory in ayush CD ayush okay mkdir I used to okay I used to now we are done again I will go on the home directory and what I will do I will create one more directory mkdir um test 67 okay so here you can see I wish I've been created already and they are used so directly we have another I used to and text 67 where it is oh yeah here this is one okay so I will perform here LS and now you can see all the direct which we have created now what I have to tell you like to remove this directory uh the command is rmdir Okay remove directory so there is a one thing in this like uh let me clear this all uh if directory is empty okay if like uh suppose this direct test 67 there is nothing this is empty directory so in this case we can easily use rmdir okay we can easily use it but if directory is not empty suppose in this case I used to so in this case when we will do rmdir so what will happen like it will uh like it will not delete that particular directory it will show you the error like uh directory is not empty okay but when you go in the iOS direct and when you will try to delete I used to then it can be easily deleted why the reason behind is this like I used 2 is empty okay I hope you got this point like how rmdr command works so uh now our job is to just delete the directory and learn the things okay so let's start so what we will do uh LS now I will first try to delete the test 67. test six seven okay so now what will happen I will hit just enter and now boom so you test this t7 has been deleted okay now again we will try to do LS here and so you will not see anywhere like test67 is there now now what we will do and yeah one more software I want to tell you that for clearing the terminal if you do clear then it will clear obviously but there is also one more shortcut like Control Plus l automatic it will get clear okay so now what we have to do we have to remove the directory ayush okay now let's see what happens fail to remove ayush directory not empty okay obviously direct is not empty we know like there is another folder in ayush so what we will do now we will go in if directory and then I will try to first delete I used to okay we have deleted and there is no any directory now what I will do I will go back in the home directory and I will delete ayush okay so I use has been deleted okay so suppose if there is many folders and directories like Suppose there in ayush there is I use two twice hundred okay or in that particular director there are other more directors okay so you have to delete this so this is very tedious work like uh like it's not easy to do one by one okay so like the solution for that is that like if we will use some flags with it okay so now again let me create a directory I will use hyphen P option if you watch previous video then you will get it what is hyphen p and all these things so I'm going to create uh not test let's create with iPhone I used to if3 so what what will happen here like in are you shown there will be I used to in ih2 they will rise three so you can check here uh 2 and I stand in ISO there will be nothing that will be empty directory so now what I have to do I have to delete this whole directory in single command so what I will do there are multiple ways I will tell you everything issue one by one the more different ways okay so we will use rmdir slash S okay and then we will just provide the directory name I use one okay so uh what this command will do basically it will delete the whole directory from the root to the in like child like it will start from ayush and it will end to the is3 and it will delete the whole file structure and with this command it will ask you for the permission like you have you will need to enter yes or no whether you want to delete or not like just like confirmation message it will ask for you let's check what happens okay uh it's showing no such file or directory why uh one minute let me check with this iPhone help whether it works in Ubuntu or not okay sorry we can use hyphen P option for that okay sorry what we will do rmdir hyphen t are you sure I think we will need to provide whole path okay I use three so we can easily have we have deleted easily in this way also we can use rmdr in this way okay but there is also one way uh that slash is I will need to just check with the Google uh why this command didn't work uh not working with Ubuntu make I have used this command earlier it was working in my Linux machine uh let me check with it um and also let's go with the rmdr slash okay Google is your friend buddy like if you will stuck somewhere then this is your only friend where you will get the help okay okay so here is the like documentation of Microsoft then if it is Microsoft then like it should be correct here slices what it's saying deletes a directory this is why I can also up directly including all files okay we were corrected and this rmdir slash S test to remove a direct name test and always okay we were doing the same thing I didn't get to why it's not working in Ubuntu uh like there may be some reason uh here you can see uh like there is uh then maybe okay I'll leave it uh I will try one once more let's check it happens or not I'll try to create again the same directory I will just hit the what was the command rmdir slashes and uh are you sure it's there okay okay okay okay okay fail to remove okay if I do Force fully then what happens okay it's not working even so now what are the options to delete the whole directory in a single command like slash has failed in Ubuntu I don't know why we'll figure it out later uh but now what is the other way so there is a way so what we will do we can we use the RM command okay with the help of this command we can easily delete all the files like in a single command what we will use the flag with it RM hyphen RF okay and then are you sure done we are done buddy like RF stands for recursively and Fs terms of forcefully we can easily use this RM command to remove these directories in a one single command okay so uh that's all for um today I hope you got it like how we can delete the directories you know in this uh by using a particular single command or by one by one command like basically uh in the like uh real world we basically use this RMI from RF okay we use it uh because uh like uh whenever we create a direct rate will not be empty like you can get it you can relate it with it like whenever you create then you create it for some kind of purpose that's why so we can easily use this RM iPhone RF command for this uh removing directory okay so that's all for today uh I hope you liked it I hope and if you have any query then please you can ask us in comment section and yeah please do like share and subscribe our Channel and yeah thank you thank you for watching this video how we can create files in Linux using touch command okay so here and here in both side there is files there is files okay and I will move into that particular directory files okay and now what I will do I will create some files using touch command okay so I will do touch file one dot txt okay so basically what this command will do it will just like delete the uh sorry I'm saying delete it will just create file one dot txt okay but that file will be empty for you like there will you cannot write anything like that and you will need to first open that file then you will need to write in that date okay but there are also some ways where we can perform both things like simultaneously we can like create files and we can write something in that also but this we will see in the next video okay so first we will uh talk about this touch command so whenever I will hit enter and I will do LS and here you will see like file1.txt will be created okay so I hope it is clear to you and now what if I want to create multiple files okay then I can easily do with file2.txt file 3.txt file 4 Dot txt and I will just hit enter uh sorry LS and here you can see all these and four files have been created okay so this is the one way to create files okay and now with the touch command like we can use various options with it like hyphen a hyphen m hyphen R also we can use it so I will start with the first one that is hyphen a option basically what this option does like it will change the access time of your file suppose now we have created this file let me do LS iPhone l okay so file one has been created at this one 12 42 am okay and this is 43 and all these things so basically this is the modification time okay if you want to look at the access time you will need to hit LS iPhone Lu okay uh access time 42 okay The Hyphen L option will show you the modification time hyphen Lu option will show you the access time when the file is accessed okay so what I'm going to do I will try to access this file and now 1244 it is okay so I have accessed this file okay I will write something hi okay and I will just close it and again I will do this I will need to find the access time so here you can see the 1244 is now the access time of file one dot txt okay and I have not visited file.txt yet okay so it's access time and it is still showing 1243 so now what I have to do I will change the access time using the hyphen a option so how we can do it touch hyphen a and then file name so I want to change the access time for file name uh which one uh let's do for file1.txt okay so it will change my access time from 1244 to the my current time so my current time is what 12 45 okay and now I will do LS iPhone Lu and here you can see file1.txt okay now what I will do like here we have not uh like uh visited this file 2.txt okay even when you don't open that file we don't write anything in that word Define still you can change the access time for it okay suppose or there is someone in your like working environment like you want to change the access time or just for your any kind of purpose okay so what I am going to do uh touch hyphen a I will just change the file name from file 1 to 2. okay and now I will do LS hyphen Lu and here you can see the access time for File 2 has been like change now okay it's 1240 6 okay and now uh I will just clear it all now again I will check the access time so access time is for first one 12 45 12 46. and for let's check for modification time that is at the modification of this is showing 1244 okay and 12 43 1243 all the Y 12 44 because uh we you know we have right high in this file one dot taxi that's why it's showing 1244 okay now what if you want to change the modification time instead of this access time so what way I will do now I will just hit uh like work with the hyphen M option okay hyphen m and I will change for file 3.txt and now let's do just LS hyphen L file 3 you can do like this also and now it's swing 12 47 as here it was 12 43 now the it is modified to the 1247 and here you can see the access time is 1243 so now let's check also the access time for file 3.txt whether it is change or not it will not change because we have not done anything with it so it will be as it is like it is 1243 okay so I hope you got it how it is working the how we can basically change the access time modification time with the touch command okay we are creating files also and we can also manipulate the access time and the modification I'm using this command okay so now uh moving uh forward uh the there is also one option hyphen R okay so basically this option what it will do it will just uh like uh what we can say like copy the access time of first file to the second file okay so now what I will need to do I will show you both the uh access time I will show you for file 1.xt and what I will do touch hyphen r file one and five two dot txt okay and again I will do the ls hyphen Lu so here you can see the access time for file 2.txt has been changed from 12 46 to 12 45 and now let's check for the modification time for file 1 and file two so modification time for file 1 and file 2 is same okay I hope you got it how it is working in the access time and modification now I hope you got another like how hyphen a hyphen M and iPhone R option works together okay so that's all for this video and in the next video we will basically talk about how we can write some kind of like whatever you have to write in the file while creating a file okay so that's it for today and we will meet in the next one so thank you thank you for watching and please do like share and subscribe our Channel and if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section okay thank you thank you for watching and now in this video we will talk about uh how we can create files using cat command and also we will see some other operations using add command okay so uh let me increase the size of the terminal I think now it's fine and I will just open up my file system in my left hand side to be more clear with the you guys okay so now what we will need to do uh we will we will have to learn about uh cat command okay so basically cat command uh we can use to create files and also we can use this cat command tool like concatenate some more files together or you can say like merging more than one file in a one single file okay you can also do it in this and also uh we can use it like uh like to get the how many numbers like to show the lines and all those things in this in the particular files okay so now we will start with the creating file okay so let me do first LS so I think I have some files directory let me check what is there okay file on file 4 okay now what is uh let's create some files with cat command Okay so cat I will go with the test1.txt and what here the main benefit is that we can simultaneously write whatever we want to write in that particular test file so here I am just writing this is test one file okay in txt format and what you have to do you have to just hit enter and then Ctrl T okay so in this way we can create files okay and now what we have to do we have to do LS and here you will see test1.txt has been created for you and here also you can see it okay now now the other feature of cat command is that like you can also read the contents of that text file so how you can do it you can just get and then the whatever the file name is there you can provide it okay at test1.xt I will hit enter and here you will see the whatever is the content of the file um like it is being printed here okay so uh this is the like two operations we covered and now what we will need to do uh I'll create one more file okay uh cat uh test two Dot txt okay and here I will write this is test to file in txt format okay and just hit enter and then Ctrl D and now what we will do we will see the content of test2.txt and here you can see this is test 2 file in txt format okay now what we will need to do what I will do I will try to like concatenate like uh what you can say test test two content in test one okay so how I can do it get test1 dot txt then again this redirection operator this is called redirection operator and test2.txt hit enter I will try to see the content of first test one let's see what is there okay so basically this command like will append in test2.txt not in text one sorry for that okay test two and here you can see like the whatever the content of text one file has been included in this particular Test 2 file okay from here you can see also like when I will just hit double click on it and here you can see the same thing here also okay so this is the one way of like appending uh two files together okay and what we can do uh if you want to like append content of those file in another some file likes suppose like test three file so what we will do we will there is just simple a cat uh test1.txt test2.txt and then nothing just a redirection operator and here we will write test3 Dot txt and now what we will do we will see here like test 3 has been created also when we will do LS here you can see test 3 has been created now what we will do I will try to read the content of test 3. 3 Dot txt okay oh so here you can see the content of both the files like this is showing test on two terms because in test two uh it was there like this was the content of Testo file okay so in this way we can like merge multiple files as many you want okay and now I'm moving forward like now we will learn about some like uh what we can say little bit options which we can use with this card command so first option I will uh I want to show you is cat hyphen n test3.txt so this command basically what it does it uh basically like show you the lines with number wise okay here you can see this first line This is third line now similarly here also you can see the uh like all those things like one two three okay so this is the one way uh to like get the files by number wise and if you want to uh check the like end where is the ending of that all the line then at that time it will show you the dollar character at the end of the line okay here you can see like here the line is ending that's why it is showing dollar here what if we will do uh here I will change little bit uh like here I will change like uh this is another file and I will just hit Ctrl s and full stop also and let me cut this and here you can see the line is ending here okay so I hope you got it why it's showing dollar dollars because like here at this point of line uh sentence or at this point of word thus the line has been ended so here that's why here it is Swing dollar okay so this is the basic use of hyphen e command okay and now uh what if you want to add like some more content in uh like previous file previous file it means like it is already created you don't have to create anything for it so for that you don't have to do anything uh you have to just apply double the direction of it that is this one okay and suppose I want to write in test1.txt okay and here first we will see the content of this so here you can see this is test on file index free format and I have to write something like this is a tutorial based on Linux cities or something like that okay and just hit Ctrl D okay and I will just like uh reopen this particular file um okay so here you can see like uh this is tutorial based online site has been I like added in this particular test1.txt file okay and uh there is also one like option which we can see like uh hyphen T option okay so basically what it does uh it will show you the tab like where where is the tab in the particular line okay so what I will do now I will just like uh give a tab here okay one time two tab three time I'm giving here okay and just Ctrl s and the tab will be represented by this this symbol I think let's see what it shows cat file one dot uh sorry what is the file name okay test1.txt test one dot txt okay so this is the content which we saw and now what I will do I will just have to use the High 20 option and here you can see and this is uh the particular symbol and I III it's showing like three tabs is there it is showing that's it okay so uh uh that's all about uh like this cat command okay I hope you liked it and if you have any issue or if you are facing any problem any kind of confusion then you can ask us in comment section and yeah please do like share and subscribe our Channel okay thank you thank you for watching we'll meet in the next video and now in this video we will talk about RM command Okay so RM basically stands for remove okay so in this basically like video we will uh we're gonna talk about how we can remove files okay and also like basically this uh the RM command basically we use it for removing files but also we can use it for removing directories also okay so today we will see and learn all about this so now what we have to do I will just create some files okay let me do a list okay so there is no any files I have deleted all okay start with touch one dot txt two Dot txt 3 Dot txt and four dot txt okay I hope you you are aware of this touch command as we have already covered okay now unless so here you will you can see like all the four files have been created okay now what I have to do uh I will tell you about the RM command okay so basically uh Rim command is used to remove the directory how we can uh sorry denote directors files also okay not only directory okay so what we will do uh we will try to remove the one dot txt okay so how I can do it RM and then the file name one dot txt and now what I will do I will just hit LS and here you can see 1.xt is not here okay it is deleted now again let's start with 2 Dot txt it is also related now let's uh Delete three Dot txt and again 4.txt okay now let's hit it enter NLS and here you will see uh all the files which we have created has been deleted okay so uh like this is how tedious work like when you will remove one by one one by one so if you want to remove many files like at one time okay so how you can do it so again I will need to just create all those texts so I created a photo of four txt files now what I have to do I will just rm1 then 2 then 3 then 4. I will just hit enter and LS all file that's gone okay nothing is there so all file has been deleted now so now let me tell you about the sum of the options which you can use with this RM command like hyphen f hyphen I also Capital IV all these things I will tell you okay so again let me get those files okay now files has been created here now I will show you RM hyphen I option small I uh what it will like do what so basically it just prompts you for the like confirmation like whether you want to delete this file or Not by sometime what happens you by mistake like delete some of the files you don't get any prompt and all so with this option you will get prompt okay so I will just hit enter and here you will see removed regular empty file you have to do yes or no if I will do yes it will get deleted I will just hit enter LS and then see one.txt has been deleted what if I do n list 2 for 2.xt and so obviously this file will not be deleted so true dot dxt is at as it is okay so this is about a hyphen I like a small eye with which you will get uh prompt about whether you want to delete or not some files okay but you will think about in this case you we were deleting like all these four txt files like in a one single command okay but we were so how we can get uh prompt for this so there is also option for it okay so uh let me first remove all these files 3.xt4.txt okay LS there is no files and again I will just try to create those four files okay now uh there is also one option like hyphen capital i okay what it does when you will go to demo more than three files it will ask you for the confirmation whether you want to delete all those files at once okay or not but it will ask only once okay so how we can do it touch you not sorry one dot txt two dot txt3.txt four dot St here you can see we have how many files four files I will hit enter and again here you will see remove do you want to remove four arguments if you will do yes why then obviously it will be delete and now we will do LS so here you will see there is no any files okay all files has been deleted okay there is also more options like hyphen V okay what it does sorry if I will go with hyphen V option we can like combinely use more than two options together so hyphen we what it does it will show you what is being done okay so let's hit enter I will say yes and here you will see what happened removed one.txt then two dot txt then three then four okay sorry so these are the four files which have been deleted and you have got the information like what was going on uh after uh like hitting this particular command Okay so hyphen we have some only just displays the what is going on okay and now let's move towards like uh directories okay how we can delete uh empty directories or uh like nonempted directory so let me create One Directory hyphen p uh I will choose with the uh A1 A2 A3 okay so like are you uh you will get like in A1 director there will be two in A2 there will be a three directory okay so I will do LS and uh if you want to go in the A1 directory so when you will do LSI you will get the A2 direct okay so in similar way in A2 there is A3 now I'll go in the home directory I will clear the screen now I want to remove this particular directory to remove directories which is nonempty like in A1 there is something okay so for this we basically use the r option with r we can use f of f option for Force fully deleting okay but we are not using here it okay so I will just go with the A1 and I will hit enter and all the directors will get deleted okay if I do LS so that you will see there is no A1 now what I will do I will just create again those directories and uh I will run with the iPhone V option okay and here we will see remove directory first A3 then A2 then A1 okay uh if you want to use hyphen I option then also you can use a small I it will ask you yes then it will ask you for the next you yes then next you have to do yes so remove directory A1 A2 A2 then again y then again for the final one so in this way uh like uh we can use the RM command with the iPhone b i r and these are all options okay now if you want to delete uh like um empty directory okay so this is a empty okay there is nothing into S zero zero you can also do with r option but there is also one more like uh what you can say flag or option is D we basically is the empty directors May loot as 0 0 and it will delete the okay so test user has been deleted now uh again I will show you with the hyphen V option so you can get the like confirmation or there should be no any confusion regarding things okay so hyphen V and yeah zero zero okay so uh that's all for today and I hope you liked it about this like how we can remove files and directories with the RM command as this is a basic class command okay and now today in this video we are going to talk about one of the more basic command that is a CP command Okay so CPS stands for just like copy okay what we will do like basically we will copy files and directories from one directly to another or from one file to another just like in Windows we do right click and click on copy and all so same thing like will happen here but using command line okay or you can say using CP command Okay so let's start the tutorial uh first of all open up the terminal and let me increase the font size for you okay now it's okay and open this files like for your reference okay so here it is and now what I will do LS so here are some files okay uh let me create uh One Directory copy command okay I will move into this particular directory and here also I will move in that directory okay so here you can see uh there is no any files or directors here what I want to create I want to create uh files uh let's create one dot txt I will write this as 1 dot txt file Ctrl D okay here you can see 1.xt file has been created now what if you want to create uh the copy of this particular text file okay so how you can do it so to perform this action we have a basic command that is CP command okay it stands for copy so what we will do in a basic simple way we will just give the file name one dot XT and where do you want to create that particular copy I want to create in the same directory so I will just give the name of that file in which I want to uh like copy that file so anyway you will see 2.xt is not there okay so what will happen in this case like if the file exists so it will overwrite simply overwrite the whatever you have written but if file doesn't exist so it will create and then after that it will copy the content of one dot text into two dot text okay so we're going to do LS and I will try to read 2.t2.txt so here you can see the content of this particular like uh particular one dot txt file okay so this is the like one of the simple way in which we can copy the files and files okay so now uh what I want I want to copy this one dot txt file into some other locations so how we can do it so uh like right now where you are let's check you are in the this home I use copy command okay I will try to split the terminal so that will be uh helpful let me uh like create one more terminal Ctrl shift plus I hope it is visible to you um let me just reduce some size okay so now what I will do I will do LS here okay now uh let's do PWD okay and uh you are in the home ayush right now I will just copy this like path now what I want I want to copy this CP one dot text file at sorry one dot txt file right paste oh my use okay and here I will create two Dot txt so here you can see there is no any two dot X Type kind of file let's hit enter and here you will see let's do LS and here we will you will see two dot txt has been created let me open the like check the content of that particular file so relative this is one dot txt file okay uh like it was a like a little bit like difficult because you will need to give the whole path where you want uh to copy that particular file okay so in this way you can copy this like file so in any location you want you will just need to give the like whole path okay where you want to copy that particular file now one more thing I want to tell you guys let me clear the screen here also I will do lsas okay now what I want I uh like want to copy that file okay but what if two dot txt file already exists okay so what will happen so now what I will do I will add some more text n1.txt some more has been added in this file okay Ctrl d now uh let's check the content of the one dot txt so here you can see this one.txt content and let's check the container 2.txt it should be like as a similar one one.txt okay now what we will need to do I will also need to copy this uh one to text into 2.txt okay so I will just try to hit the like previous command but here what I will use I will just hit the hyphen I option okay why hyphen I option it will just prompt you for file over written thing like if file already exists so it will prompt like whether you want to overwrite the content of one dot txt or not like because there is something else in the 2 dot txt if you will like without hyphen I you will run this command so it will simply overwrite the content of one dot text into two dot txt but using hyphen I what it will do it will just prompt you for your decision whether you want to overwrite or not okay so let's hit enter and here you can see it is asking for overwrite and question mark uh whether yes or no I will just hit yes now I will try to check the content of this 2.xt file so here you can see like it has been copied okay I hope you got it uh how we you can do it also now what if I want to copy like file 1 and file 2 into some other directory okay so let me like check LS so here you can see one dot txt and two dot txt file is there now what I want I want one dot txt into some another directory same here in this the same case if directory exist then it will like uh uh like copy this files if directory doesn't exist then it will create a directory and then after that you will copy that like these files into that particular directory okay so how you can do it uh copy one.ac now directory name so uh uh what you can write copied files okay let me hit enter okay is not a director I think I will need to use iPhone R option Maybe okay uh let me create a directory copied files and now let me try to copy this uh finds it to it okay okay sorry uh let's check out this I will move into this directory and I will unless okay okay now now this files has been completed so in this case like it is not uh creating directory if that directory doesn't exist okay so uh like in this way you can like copy uh like more than one files or into some another directory okay now uh one more option is there like if you want to copy uh like one directly through some another directory you want to make a copy of directories okay so how you can do it I will move into the home directory let me clear the screen and then LS okay so what I want to I want this copy command the copy of this copy command directory so I will use CP hyphen R for recursive so it is used for the directory copies so how you can do it you will give the first the this directory name and another directory in which you want so I will use copy command V2 and hit enter and h2ls and here you will see copy command B2 has been created now let's move into this particular directory and LS so here you can see the light directors has been well I copied okay so in this way uh you can play with the copy command and all okay so that's all for today's video now in this video we will talk about uh like one of the basic command that is MV command it like it basically stands for move so basically in this video we will talk about how we can move files from one location to another or also you can say like how we can move directory from one location to another location okay so today in this video we are gonna learn about this I like how we can move files from one location to another so first of all let me open up the terminal now let me just to increase the font size for you guys so it should be visible to you and I will just open up these files for your reference so whatever we will perform in it will be visible to you guys okay okay so now what I will do first of all I will create One Directory mkdir move command okay and now what we will need to do Let Me Clear I will move into that particular directory and I will create one file touch file one dot txt we will create okay and let's touch file 1.txt okay uh also let me uh no wait a minute I will try to create a file with for cat command because I have to write something in it this is file one Ctrl D okay now just save what we will do I have to move this file one dot txt okay file one dot txt from this move would move command directly to some another directory that is I have to move this on to support desktop okay so now what I will do uh first of all I will open up one more terminal and I will move into the CD desktop okay I will do PWD I will check the like path of that particular desktop where it is so here you can see home I use desktop okay so now what we will do I will use here MB LX transform move I have to move file1.txtree to home ayush desktop and here what you can do like like this command is also useful like changing the name like we can also rename files okay but here I'm going to use only file dot txt okay and I will hit enter and on the desktop I will do here LS so here you will see file.txt has been like created okay or you can see here also on the desktop I think it is here here you can see the file dot text has been created okay so this is the basics of how we can move files from one location to another now like this command is also useful in renaming files okay so if I will do LSL so there is nothing because we have already moved it let's create another file cat file to Dot dxt this is file to okay endless and now what I want I want to rename this file file two I want to make it file 3. so we can do it for me file to same here I will just file 3.txt and I will do LS and here you will see the name of the file 2 has been changed to file three now let's check the content of file 3 whether it is same or not so cat file three so it is this is file two okay so in this way you can also rename the like file names okay I hope you got it uh now let me tell you one more another thing like if suppose here is file dot txt okay on the desktop and uh you want to move that file one which is here to move into this particular directory or particular location so if already file one dot txt like exist here so what will happen when we will like try to move files from this location to this location with the same and then it will overwrite so to overcome overcome this issue what we will use we will use hyphen I command not command hyphenite flag we will use okay first what I will do I will uh change the file name to file 1 not file on file dot text I will change LS okay now what I will do MBA file dot txt then home ayush desktop and again file Dot txt and here I will use iPhone I option and here you can see over I do you want to override this particular file which it is it is asking so I can say yes or no but before let's check the content of this file this is file 180 it is showing now I will do yes and uh hit enter and now I will again check the content of this file so here you can see this is file to okay I hope it is visible to you yeah this is this file 2 is the now the like uh decent content of this file because it is overwritten okay now next uh what are we I have to do I will try to move like uh some files into one particular directory okay so what I will do I will create two files one dot txt 2.txt now let's create a DOT text also okay now you can see LS so these are the three by which we have created now I will make a directory here on the desktop mkdir move files okay now what I will do MB 1.txt 2 Dot txt 3 Dot txt into the directory home ayush desktop on desktop.vm move files we'll hit enter and we will do lso here we can see there is no any files here now I will move into the move files and I will do LS so here you can see all the files has been and I moved at this particular locations okay so this is the another way to like moving files from one location to another like from one location to any kind of directory in which you want okay now moving forward uh what we can do like how you can copy like One Directory to another location okay or renaming it okay so let me go back here and now at desktop here you can see move files and one directory that is test directory okay now what I want I want to First rename this file or this directory so move files I will try to rename it m files now let's so here you can see the like move files have been changed to Empire now what now I want to move this M5 into this tester directory uh so what I can do on a MB m files and in the test enter LS there is no m files here now see the change reacted to test now let's do LS and here you can see m files has been moved at this particular location or you can say add the test directory okay so in this way uh like you can move files from one location to another or from One Directory to another or how you can also rename files and also in this video you'll learn about it so today we will stop here and we will meet in the next two videos so thank you thank you for watching and please if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section okay hello guys and welcome back to the channel this is ayush and now in this video here is the test for you guys till the topics which we have covered till now I think till every command we have covered so in this test we have approx 15 questions which will be given by you and after that you will get the each like one point for every correct answer and you will get the link of this form in the description of this video okay so best of luck for it and I hope you will do great and we will meet in the next video okay bye and on this video we'll cover the zip command okay so basically uh as you are aware of zip like widget files to compress the size of that particular directory or particular file which we use okay suppose you want to transfer a file of 500 MB to your friend okay but uh you want to compress that file and after that you want to send it to that your friend so when you zip that file so the size will be automatically decreased okay so that's why we use the zip command so basically in the Linux we will use the zip command okay for zipping the files and directories okay but in windows or you use on that particular GUI to zip the files okay so now in this video what we are going to do we will first of all create a One Directory mkdl zip and let's move into this directory and also maybe zip has been created yes here it is now what we will do I'll create multiple files uh one dot txt 2 dot txt three dot txt okay so basically on in a simple way how you can zip file without any option so this is a just simple like you zip and the file name which you want to give to that particular uh ZIP file so I am giving it the file dot zip and the particular files which you want to which you want to add in that particular zip file okay so now what we can do uh I will just hit uh enter and here you can see file.za Facebook data now in this particular uh therefore you can see one.txt has been added okay so but what if you want to add multiple files okay if you want to add multi multiple files in your uh that particular this zipper so how you can do it so for this what you will do I am I'm going to create another zip file zip file to dot step one dot txt 2 Dot txt 3 Dot txt and again here you can see file to dot zip in this we will get actually three files okay one two three dot extra we are getting here so this is the way of zipping multiple files together okay in a particular uh ZIP file in which you want so now what we are going to do I am again going to create some more files Touch 4 Dot txt 5.txt dot txt okay so now what I want to do I am going to zip 4 Dot txt and file three dot zip file okay so the option is one of the option of the zip command is hyphen U option which we can use to like uh add some other files in that particular zip file uh it means like in the file 3.0 right now we have only four dot txt okay so what I am going to do I will add 5 and 6 also without tampering four so the there is a hyphen new option in the zip command okay which we can use to perform that particular action so I am going to add here 5 dot txt and also 6.txt and now I will open up this zip file and here you can see four five six has been added Okay so so we will cover unzip in next video and that's why I'm going I'm showing you like this okay that's why I'm not unzipping it with the CMD okay so in this way you can add uh other files also and one more option is there like uh hyphen M option so what it does it's basically like it will zip the file and it will also delete that particular file sometimes in case you don't want to uh like um what we can say keep that particular file okay in your desk or to save your space or something like that you can think of it so how we can do it uh like here is LS we I'm going to do and here is the 6 dot till one two six dot text is file now what I'm going to do is zip hyphen M I will use five four dot zip and I will add a suppose 4.txt 5.6 Dot txt hit enter adding all those things and here you can see all the 4 to 6.txt file has been deleted and here in the file 4.0 we will get the four five six dot txt files so using iPhone you can uh like uh ZIP that all files and also uh you can delete that files to save your space Hamilton so you will not need to delete that file after the zipping of all that things okay so now moving forward what we can do so uh suppose if you have other directories also like with 30 XD files you have some other directory so how you can do it how you can zip that also so you can do that in a recursive manner like using iPhone or option so first of all what I'm going to do I will just create some other directories like let's create test okay I have created test directory and you have to like what you can say you have to add one to three dot XD files also and also test uh directory in one zip file how you can do it you have to just use hyphen R option so hyphen are option what it does it basically work as a recursive manner like it will uh ZIP your directory and also files which you you will use so let's uh and then what we can do one dot txt 2 Dot txt free Dot txt and the name of the file not file directory enter and where it is and here you can see all of your files has been added into that particular zip file okay so in this way you can add some other like more than files and directories in one zip file using a single command or using iPhone R option mostly it happens mostly we use it in like in our window system like we have multiple files in One Directory is also some other directory so you can basically like use it in this case more important thing the and the last one the last option which we will see together is hyphen e option okay it basically stands for encrypt so what it does uh let me like what I will do I will add this 1.txt file into one zip file with a password okay basically it will create a zip file within password so how you can do it zip I will write password dot zip into one dot txt like one dot text I want to zip into this particular file password Dot zip I will use hyphen e option and here it will ask for me to enter the password which you want I will use something okay ayush and here you can see adding one.txt is stored in that particular zip file so where it is uh this one password dot zip okay let me open it uh yeah and now here one dot txt and like as you can see here clock type also like it will me you know it prompt me to enter the password now I will enter and here you can see one dot txt has been unlocked as there is nothing so it's showing like nothing here okay we have not written anything in that one.txt file okay so uh that's all for today uh I hope you got it how you can zip files and also how you can save multiple files together in a single file with hyphen e option like if you want to to like protect uh or zip some sensitive files and you have to send it to some other person you don't want to disclose that particular file so you can use hypheny option also in that case so that's all for doing now in this video we will start with the most uh basic command that is unzip command okay so uh first how we will start uh I will create a One Directory that is uh sorry mkdir zip and I will move into that particular directory and I will create some files one dot txt uh so sorry to Dot txt 3.txt okay now these three files has been created now what I like to do I want to zip all these three files in uh one particular zip file okay so 1.2 XT 2.txt 3.txtree and I want to zip all these in a single file that is files dot zip okay all has been added I will do LS here you can see files.zip and for your reference I will open up this directory and here you can see all these files and the files are there in the entire in this directory so now in this particular we are going to study about uh unchip how you can unzip these particular files and particular zip files okay so the most basic and simple uh like command that is unzip we used to like extract files of this particular zip file so how we can do it we will just use unzip and the particular file name sorry and here you can see it is asking me for do you want to replace or not okay so I will just hit Ctrl C right now okay uh because I don't want to create any confusion for you guys first what I will do I will just create all uh remove all these one dot txt 2.xtend3.txt files I have now deleted all these files now what now I will use unzip and the files.zip and it will simply like extract all the files which are present in this file short zip for your reference let me open it so you can see what are the files is present so here you can see these are the three files which are present in this particular zip file so I will hit this command and done we you have simply extracted all the files of that particular file through the file okay so this is a very simple way to extract files and now moving forward uh suppose like uh you want to use these files and these 1.2.3.txt in some kind of another locations suppose in many cases you want to store these files in some other directories okay so how you can do it uh without like extracting all these files in the same direction which your files.jips so but you can extract this file in some other directories also so you can do it this is very simple now what I will do uh I will open up a new terminal or okay let me open up a new terminal uh let me include a little bit of font size for you and I will create one folder that extracted files okay I'll move into this folder and I will copy the whole path that is home I use extracted files okay in this terminal you can copy by Ctrl shift C okay I will just move it here now what if you want to like unzip the files in some particular directory so for this if we use basically hyphen D option okay in this we will provide the path of that particular particular directory where you want to store that particular extracted files so unzip and then the file name which you want that is files.zip and hyphen D and then Ctrl shift V and here we want our files in this extracted files directory okay now what we will do here I will do the stylus in this particular terminal and here you can see all of these files has been like extracted in this particular directory so in this way also like you can store your extractor file in some kind of another directory okay so this is another simple trick like which you should know about it and also there are many options like suppose in case what happens you have extracted your files uh the file already but sometimes also what happens you accidentally click on it so in this case in Linux what happens when you try to like unzip files and in the same directory or you can say in another another so here you can see we have already these files one two three dot txt what what where what will happen when I will try to hit the same command again so it will ask me for do you want to override these files or none or nothing or else okay I said I will say yes okay and again it is asking for 1.2 XT again I will say yes again for 2 dot TX 10 3 dot text okay yes so again these all the files has been replaced okay in case if I would made any changes in this well then I will definitely choose no because I don't want to create any kind of problem for myself okay so like this is the basic uh options which we can use to unzip files and also uh like you should know about one more option that is uh hyphen Q option what is it okay I Will Show You by uh first what I will do I will remove the all these 1 Dot and all these files from this directory okay so here you can see there's only five Starship what basically in simple case what happens when I do it will show me these messages okay extracting these files extracting 2. text extracting three dot txt uh in some cases we don't want this kind of information because we know it will simply extract the files so for this what we can use we can use just uh hyphen Q option iPhone q and then file storage zip it will just avoid like it will not print any kind of extra things so uh for before hitting this command I'll try to again remove all those files and now I will use iPhone key option and done so in this case we didn't get any kind of information or any kind of message like whether this file has been extracted or not okay now again let me remove it and I will again tell you one more option that is hyphen L option basically if you are aware of Ls command so you will definitely know about LS hyphen L option which basically like list all the uh means list of files in a long format okay you can say like we get many kind of things like date time user guest not guest groups user groups access time modify time we get all those kind of information and simply uh you can say permissions also like we will have a separate lecture permissions okay so now what we can do on J python L and again I will try to unzip this files uh it is looking so much like so much stuff are there let me clear first string screen now again I will write NG by funnel and then file store ZIP and here you can see the more extra information about the extracted files you can see the length the length is 0 and date time name all these titles all these things okay so it basically doesn't extract but it simply shows you the whatever the files are present in the particular uh zip files okay so that's it for today now in this video we are going to cover the most important topic of how the Linux series that is the permissions okay so uh in this video we will cover the console which slides inside this particular topic and uh commands we will cover in the next video okay so basically uh let me tell you about the permissions I hope you may be aware of it uh but still let me tell you like um I will tell you with one of the example with a real life example uh suppose you have a PC and you are the administrator of that particular PC and you have some other users like your brother or you can or your sister okay and you have some kind of files okay which you don't want to show those files to that particular user particular your brother okay so in this case what you will do you will specify a particular permission to that file so that file should not visible or should not accessible to other user so in this way we can set permissions to the files or directories or whatever you want so that should not be accessible to other users or other person okay or you want your profiles to like keep it secret or keep it private you can say so uh I will tell you with the a diagram also so that it will be easy to understand for you guys so here you can see you here is the administrator that you okay and uh suppose here is your brother uh your brother okay or so study you can see and also you have some files also that is I will name it as a private files okay and this one and from this to this you have like you will have the access and your brother will not have the access for it not access okay so in this way you can just understand like this is the private file okay you have the administrator you have the access for it but your brother or sister uh if they want to access this particular file they will get the error like permission denied or something like that okay so in this way permission like you can get the scenario of the how permission work okay so now uh in our Linux operating system or you can say Ubuntu uh sorry I will show you the permissions Okay so I hope you are aware of Ls command so this command basically doesn't so much information about the what are the permission what is the size who is the user who is the group all this thing it does also but when we will do LSI funnel then it basically like what we can say long listing description of the files and directories okay wait a minute so in this way here you can see there are multiple columns so I like you will think first like what are these things so I'm not getting anything but here you can see like this is First Column is just for permissions next column is for this is the hard links which we will cover in other videos okay and this is the user who is the user web access of that particular directory and who are the groups and this is the file size date modification date and time these things are there and this is obviously the directory name so right now in this video we don't have to focus on all these other columns like user group we will have a separate video when at the time we use occasion all these things but now in this video we have to only focus on these particular things like only on the First Column what is the drwx WXR what are these things so we will cover now in this video okay so I hope you got it now what I will do increase the font size first let it be 18 not 18. uh 24 yeah uh wait a minute yes first uh I will write the rwx okay again similar thing is we have to do as WX and RW X I will tell you one by one what is these things so basically R what is r R stands for read and uh we have W stands for right okay and x x stands for execute okay so these are the some like notations RW access for the permission in our Linux operating system that is R stands for read it just means suppose you have a file and you want to give that file only the read access to some kind some other user similarly in kind of your brother's sister okay suppose here is you like some documentation you have and you want to show it to your brother so you can give only the read permission to your brother or to your other user like he can only read these files okay and what is the right permission suppose when you will give the read and write permission to this particular documentation file so in this case suppose uh they are in the same project with you so what will happen they can change these files also according to him and the rwx is nothing but the read write execute it means you will give the all the permissions like execute permission we basically use for the some kind of scripts and all these things like when we will cover basket scripting so you will get to know about this dot sh files and all or we can say dot Pi also for python files okay so these are the things for in the read write execute so I hope you got it what is read what is right what is execute so now here comes why I have written these three three three so here is the reason behind it the first section is only for the user the user uh whoever is the user they will have the like these permission right now they have read write execute all these three permissions okay and next is for group okay and uh next is for uh wait a minute next is for home other or you can say some other books or some other on net you can get like other world or anything else like okay so uh these are the 3D permission total nine nine permission we have three for user other three for group and other three for other like other world okay so here you can see in our system uh I will make a directory so it will be visible to you and I will try to create One Directory test one and uh Touch file dot txt LS Okay so like here you can see I've created two files like with when you will apply this semicolon then you can write multiple commands in one single line okay I hope you you got to learn new things okay so now I will do uh LSI funnel so here you can see uh the file permissions for uh user and D is for directory and this hyphen is for only for the files okay there are some also other notations which will cover in advanced video okay when we will executing commands Okay so here you can see rwx rwx that is how much it uh that is 6 and again r w x okay so here in place of w you can see that is hyphen means it means zero like uh that other user is not having any permission to write anything inside the directory okay and this rwx rwx the user and the group have all the permissions okay I hope you got it so uh now what we have to do uh now I will tell you about some kind of like uh you can say numeric representation like how we can represent the uh what we can say permissions of this so basically what happens this is in this uh foreign wait a minute for R we basically gave a number that is read wait a minute I will write here only here for R we give particular number that is 4 okay and for right we give it to and for one we give it for execute we give it one so overall when you will add all these numbers so for all suppose if you want to give all the permission to some kind of file so in this case you will provide this 777 okay it means you are providing seven for user also 7 for group also other seven four other also and suppose uh and also one more is remaining that is zero what is 0 0 is nothing for no permission okay if you will give it 0 to some other like for any case you will give it a zero then they will not have any kind of permissions okay now Suppose there is a file that is uh suppose this documentation file I want to give this as a only uh read and write permission to the no rewrite execute permission to the user so in case of user I will write 4 plus 2 plus 1 that is I will write 7 for the user okay and similarly for group what for group I just want to give them only what we can say uh write permissions okay so I will just give it them two okay it basically means zero plus 2 plus 0 like it will automatically like uh accept like uh that particular group has only write permissions okay and for other users suppose uh you want to give it as for other I want to give them as six like four plus two plus zero so they will only have the read and write permissions okay so overall what we will write we will write 7 2 seven two and six okay all right now I don't want a mouse with me so I'm getting this problem okay so now so to give the permission to like uh for user you want to give them all the permission so we can you can give it simply as seven for group suppose you want to give only the right permission you can give it to or suppose you want to give other or like only uh read and write permission so you can give it 4 plus 236. so the overall like uh number which you will provide in the CH mode command that is the uh 726 so what uh when you don't want to give any permission to the other user so in this case you can give it them as a zero suppose uh the same scenario like you want to give group S2 so what you can do that is seven to zero simple so uh I hope you got it the concept of rewrite execute and how this is divided like r w x r double x r double X what is this three like we have like say permission for read write execute for one user then for group for other and also I hope you got this representation of numeric okay in binary also we can represent like for four I think we represent uh one double zero and yeah let me write it for binary also so for binary we write one double zero and uh for four for two I think we write uh uh it's 0 1 0 it may be uh I hope I am correct uh wait a minute so for two what we write uh zero one zero and the for one uh it's I think zero zero one should be zero zero one okay so uh let me check it once also I don't want to like share raw information with you guys uh 4 in binary it's one double zero okay yeah here you can see one double zero and for two it should be zero one zero yeah U zero and zero is there uh we can get like zero one zero it is there and for one we will get uh yeah zero one okay so this is correct so in binary also you got to learn about how we can write in the binary also so uh that's all for today's video I hope you liked and now in this video we are going to cover the one command that is the change mode or you can say CH mode also basically this command is used to change the permissions so this thing we have covered in our last video okay so now a particular CH mode is one of the command that we basically use to change the permissions of the certain files or directory you can say okay if you don't want to provide a permission to any user or any groups or anything any other user whom you don't want to provide access or want to provide Excel then you can use this particular command okay so now in this video uh first of all let me increase the size so it will be visible to you so now what we have to do I will create one directory that is access dni like this now what I have to do I will create two folders or you can see directors also secret one see create two and one file that is private dot txt okay now you can so I have done a list so these are all the files or the active which you have created now when I will do wireless iPhone so you can get these information of the long format in the long format okay so I hope you are aware of this what is drwx okay and what is this iPhone I hope you but let me tell you one more time like what are these things so basically hyphen is for files are this for read so if you will provide read permission then you can read that file then if you provide write code then you can write your favorite execute and that file will be executable okay so for uh form like indepth information you can watch our previous video on the permissions okay so now what we have to do uh today in this video what we will go uh going to do like we will change the permissions of certain files or directories okay so now uh the command which I was talking about that is CH mode it's basically stands for change mode okay change mode of what files or directors so we have learned already learned the uh like two representations of this uh permissions like one is a uh numerical and one is alphabetical like when you will do rwx it is alphabetical and four to one is for what numerical okay so now what I will do I will first clear the screen and let's open it so now you can see the file permission of this private.txt so this is file and this is this like file has not any executable permission of this of the user or any other like on group also and for others it has only read permission okay so now what I have to do I will try to add executable permissions to this particular file okay so how can I do it so the most and simple approach is CH mode plus plus means basically when you want to add permissions to each and every like user group and others so then we will use plus so now what we have to do I have to use x like I have to add executable permission to this file then file name then enter now again I will try to check the permission so here you can see in users also executables has been added in groups also executables has been at and in what we say in others also executables has been added so this is the most basic approach for adding permissions in some files or directories and here you can see the color has been also changed because it has now the executable permission that's why color has been changed from normal to green okay so uh what if you want to remove permissions okay so there is also way for it if I want to remove permissions like executable or okay so what I will do minus x minus y minus this because we use minus to remove the permissions now again you can give the file name that is private.txt again same thing I'll repeat LS iPhone L and here you can see executable permission has been removed from the user also group also and others also okay so this is the simple basic approach what if you want to remove like uh what we can say all the permissions so if I will do CH mode minus RW private.txt now here you can see all the permissions has been removed from this private.txt like a user has also no any permission or whether the groups has also not not any permission and others also have have got any permission so now what type will happen I will try to access this file so let's see what happens here you can see permission is denied why it's showing this error because the read permission like we have removed all the permission so simultaneously permission has also be removed okay so what I if I will add only the read permission okay what will happen now CH mode plus read then file name again I will do LSI funnel and here you will see the read permission has been added to all the groups now what I will do I will try to access this file private.txt and here you can see uh but here nothing is written that's why it's showing like nothing else has been printed but now you can see we can access this but here also you can see the right permission is not there so what if I will try to write some kind of files or some kind of thing or text in this file then let's see what happens whether we are able to write or not so here you can see permission denied why because you don't have right permission to change uh to change anything in this particular file okay so uh I hope you got it like how this uh like we can remove commissions we can add permissions then how we can do certain permissions together or add or remove okay like we did here like video we do two permissions together in this case hyphen RW okay so uh this approach is basically applies for if you want to apply certain permission for all the like offer all these three like for the users also for the groups also and for the this one others also what if you want to apply permissions to only user okay so how will you do it okay so in this case what will happen how you can do it like let me clear the screen LSI final okay now what I want to do I want to give the read sorry write permission to only the user okay so how I can do it CH mode then for user we use U and equal to is used to like assign certain only a specified permission to that particular user group or other okay now I will use here w and then private.txt and here you can see W has been added okay but uh uh yeah but read permission has been demo but uh so basically what happens here in this case when you provide this U equal to w so it only like what we can say it only uh like uh add that permission and whatever you have a default permission it will get removed okay so when we will use equal so it will just replace or you can say it will remove the other permission and it will add this new one okay so now what I have to do I will do uh like add read permission again in this user so how I can do it CH mode U Plus read okay private.txt so here you can see we have added read permission as well in this particular file what if you want to give like write permission to this one to others or two groups also for for groups so there is a notation of what we can say G okay and again unless I finally if you do hey you can see right permission has been added and for others we use o again unless iPhone L and here you can see the right permission has been added in this private Dot txt file okay so in this way uh you can add remove permission for users for groups or for others okay so this is basically for the like what we can say uh alphabetical notation okay but uh but numerical notation is I think it's good to use like it is easy also you can easily understand but if you're beginner you will think like yeah this is a easy so so now what I have to do I have I will remove all the permissions from this what we can say private.txt file so CH mode minus RW from all it will remove the from all the okay new permissions are W minus okay let me try to remove like this like a equal to or 0 0 I can give yeah so now here you can see all the permission has been removed why zero zero I will tell you uh in a little bit now so now what we have to do we will add permissions in this particular file using the octal notation of the like this octal notation of what we can say permission so let me like tell you those things again so that will be helpful for you so for octal notation what happens we use r equal to 4 okay and we use write to and execute equal to 1 okay so if you want to give the means all permissions okay like read write execute to particular user or particular group or particular other okay so what you will need to do you will need to give it as a seven like you want to give four also you want to give two also you want to give X also okay so overall it is seven so let me tell you with an example so that will be easy to understand okay so now what I will do CH mode 777 this 7 is for first seven is for user second seven is for group and this third seven is for others so if I will do 777 it will give all the permission to all those user group and others and now I will do this hyphen n and here you can see all the permission has been added to that particular private.txt file so now I will do some kind of changes I will again remove all the permission by applying 0 0 to all those okay so here I have removed all those permissions so now in this case what I have to do I have to only give the read permission okay uh let me open a text file for you uh or another terminal I will open so for R what we have for for write what we have to for execute what we have one so in this case what I want to give the user only I want to give them read and write okay so for user I will just write six okay and I want to give the group only write permission so two and I don't want any kind of permission to others so I will give it there as 0. okay and then find them so now here you can see we have only read write permission to this user only write permission to the group and there is no any permission to the what we can say or others okay so uh in this way I hope you got it like how you can change the permission based on this octane number I hope you got it like we have covered this in the last video okay so r equal to four to one that is seven if it is seven and it will give you the all the permissions you write execute together okay now what if you want to uh give permissions like uh what you can say suppose if you want to change permission uh from read write for user I will just give them as a one let's see what happens so here you can see only like what you can say others has been added execute okay not anyone else okay so this is a happening I think because of we have provided only one one means uh there is not a three values so now what we will do I will provide one to everyone let's see what happens you will see you have to only play with it when you will not play then you will not learn anything okay so that's all depends upon you so here you can see if I provided one to everyone so only execute permission has been added to all of them okay and if I provide two so let's see what happens only write permission has been added okay so I hope you got it uh let me provide uh like uh for user I will provide only execute for group I will provide an execute that is three another zero what happens same execute write execute and zero okay so I hope you got it like uh how you can do or change the permissions with the help of this octal numbers and all okay so uh that's all for today yeah One More Concept is remaining here like uh when I will release iPhone L here you will sometimes get the hyphen uh High not hyphen you will get instead of X you will get some kind sometime s so s is nothing but a set uid it basically means like when you provide a file uh like with that permission so what will happen it will run that particular file on behalf of you okay so uh let me uh check about the password uh one net in this iPhone and user bin okay so here you can see the S and here who is the user root is the user and also here is root is the user I hope you know about the root user like this is the main user if if you are not able to run any file you don't have any questions then you you can use the root user to run run those file so here what happens this is the password is one of the command to change the password of your PC okay or you this machine so basically what happens when we run this password command so we basically run this password command on behalf of whom on behalf of this root user that's why we have given it them as a s permission that is the set uid permission okay what will happen whenever you will run this password command okay so what happens it will like say you were changing a password for ayush okay so I don't have to change it right now so here what is happening this command is running on behalf of this root e so that's why we provided uh s permission so this is basically a special permission you can learn more about this on the Google okay so I don't have to change okay I will just close the terminal that's all so I have you got it like how you can do with the octal representation with the uh alphabetical notation so that's all for today we are going to cover the most important topic of how this next series that is the user creation okay so basically in this video we are going to cover the how you can create users what are the files affected by you by creating that particular user and how you can create what are the root users sudo command and we are going to cover many things in this particular video okay so before moving forward uh I just want to discuss about obesity a base a very basic thing that is what are the users okay I hope you you like you're aware of it like if you're using this pieces then you are the user if someone else is this using this particular PC and if he has or she has an account in the spirit and he see or he is the user so basically what are the user users are nothing but you can say uh a particular person a particular entity what he can just like change the files and directories or he can do whatever he want okay so moving forward in this video uh I will like start with the very basic thing like categories or types of users in our Linux system okay so I hope this terminal visible to you okay I will just write right now I'll just write things okay so the hash is basically just for comment okay so if whatever I will write it will like not execute as a command okay so there are two types of user in all this Linux operating system that is one is root user or you can say administrative user and other one is the normal user okay so what are the root users so if you are following the series then I don't think you are aware of the root user so but now we will cover it what is this so root user is basically that user who has access of the all the files and system like he he is just like administrator he can do anything he wants okay he has access of everything but what a normal user a normal user nothing but like who doesn't have all the access okay so uh if you take uh like real life example suppose you are a administrator of how this Windows PC or Linux PC anything okay and there is someone else who who has also access of this place but he is a normal user so I will just tell you like if you want to change the password of your of your account you can change it okay but if you want to change the password or anything uh files of that other user then you can access it but that user cannot access the file of this particular what which to use a root user or administrative or administrator okay so basically the difference between in this is like normal user can't access the files of administrative user button yes we can do it using the one of the functionality that is a sudo command okay I will tell you what are the sudo commands what is this how it works okay so this is all about the basics of difference between the root user and the normal user I hope you got it now moving forward uh now uh I will tell you about the sudo command what is this okay but before it I will try to like uh cover one thing also the root user I will first set up the root user then I will tell you about the sudo command one of the root users like I just described like he has access to all the permission but by default in this Ubuntu OS root user doesn't work because it is disabled okay so to enable it what you can do you can just simply change the password because you know the dot user is created you will just change the password okay so I will need sudo also because I don't I think it requires permission so the this pass WD is a command to change the user or to change the password of any user so I am changing the root okay here it is asking for my password and here I will try to add password of this root user okay so here we have successfully changed the password of this root user so now to login as a root user what you can do you can change the switch user okay AC root means Su stands for switch user and root is that's the username of that particular user and I will type the password and here you can see the hostname has been changed from IOS to the so I will do LS here so that I have all the files I can see here if I will go to go back I will do LS here you can say test user has been created by me okay so that's all about it like root user now uh what I will do is wait from this root user okay so we have created the root user and we have successfully set up the root user now moving forward the I was going to tell you about the sudo command what is this sudo Sudo what is the sudo command like there is a Boom episode like if anything doesn't work then you will just apply sudo and that thing will work okay so how it work basically that sudo command is nothing but uh like um you can say how should I explain let me explain it by you an example suppose uh you have a file okay file.txt you don't have access to it okay but if you want to access to it you can use the sudo command to access it okay I'm just giving you an example so how it works basically uh sudo command when you use it it like it will work on behalf of the which user the root user okay the root user because root user has access to all the files okay so what you will do you will try to access that file on behalf of root user okay I hope you got it okay so but now there is a question like then every user like suppose I am this ayush user I can access suppose I create some another user I used to then he can also access this particular administrative file but no the that's not a thing for this to work what you will need to do you will need to this I use 2 into a sudoers file that is some kind of file that is pseudos I think that that is the name I will Google it okay but remember I think this is the file sudo's file it is there okay so in this file that particular user should be added or should be present to run sudo command okay so you will see all these things after when you will create a user and all these things you will see it everything okay so don't worry about it so have you got it what is the sudo command and all these things now moving on to the main topic of our this video is the user creation okay so before starting uh there are some Concepts which you should learn okay so I have already written it on this notion okay so the concept which you should learn the first and basic thing is uid what is the uid UI did nothing but a user identification number you can say or user identifier so in Linux every user has their own unique ID okay so I will tell you my unique ID so if you will type ID and ayush here you can see my uid is 1000 and GID is 1000 this is the group ID and groups and all these things okay so now you have to focus only on this this part uid so now my uid is what 1000. okay if I want to change look at the root ID what are the what is the uid of the root so this is only 0 okay so that's thing I have written here like the ranges of uid is from 1 to 500 only for so here for system users uid ranges from 1 to 500 and for the other users it starts from 1000 as in the Ubuntu and Fedora it just starts from 1000 1000 but 0 0 is reserved for which user root user or administrative user it is just the root is just the username okay so this is the concept of the uid okay so now what I will I'm going to tell you like uid I you got it the ID is 0 for the root user and 1000 for the ayush okay this is the ID which is generated for a whatever user you will create it will get added by one and one okay so now the next concept is uh the where the details of user is stored okay so there are some kind of files which are getting infected when you create a user the most uh like uh usual or you can say important file that is since it is a past WD is one of the file and other file is Slash the Etc shadow so essentially this is just a directory and it's just their location where it exists okay so the pass WD and Shadow file are the two file which get effect and also there are some other files so those we will not cover right now so these are the two files which getting affected okay so now if you will see the content of the slash ATC pass WT okay so what you will see wow I don't think you will understand anything right now okay let me clear the screen but before that let me tell you about this what is the password file or password files okay so in this file basically uh the information is stored about the user it means what information the uid okay the group ID their name okay and other information and also some other information like Linux login cell information are stored in this particular file okay so if I'll do cats CTC let me increase the okay so the first entry is of which user the first entry is of the root user okay and the second X is just for the password like here password doesn't like it doesn't display your password it is password is stored in another file that is a shadow file okay in the hash format type okay and then this is the group ID this uid group ID their group user group and their home directory and the shell which they are using Okay pin bash so there is the like I break every part of that particular like thing like there are seven what yeah seven separators or you can say seven Concepts you can say okay in this particular file so here you can see uh mark is what username X is what password 1001 is what uid again one thousand one is what Zid again here is the additional information okay and this is the home directory and this is the login shell so what is the login cell but before understanding this you need to understand what is cell cell is nothing but which provides you an interface okay to work okay you can understand login cell is nothing but uh like whenever you login into the particular system then it starts working like you will learn about shell and Bash scripting or bash shell you will learn when we will start the best scripting concept okay so there are also some other sales you can see uh like gnu seashell console jet cell okay so now what uh I'm going to do I will create a one user okay but before that uh yeah One More Concept is remaining here like slash ATV Shadow okay now we will uh come back on this point later on after creating user and also your head you can see in my the first user that is ayush and 1000 is their uid GID and this is group additional info okay so now what I have to do clear the screen and I will going to add some users in this particular video or so I will use sudo command y sudo because user add command uh like does not work directly you can drive so if I have to user that it will give me the all the options but also if I will try to add user some kind of thing like some you can say which user test 22 so here you can see permission denied by permission denied because you don't have access to run this user add command because only root can add users so now what we will do we are going to add user on behalf of the root account okay that's why we will use sudo now now I think you got the main concept of this sudo sudo user ad I will write some good name let's take Mike oh no with that stick with that okay and uh sudo user ad VDOT just uh this is the username now I will hit enter user has been created now to look at the file where the user has been created or not what I will do I will open up another terminal okay and I will just read the password file and here you can see Virat user has been created and we still have not saved the password okay and the uid has been given to that particular user 1002 and another group ID has been given to 1002 and this is the home way that has been created but using user add command it does not reflect let's check whether it reflects or not if I do LS here you can see without directory has not been created I will tell you everything how you can do it using user add command okay and the shell which are being used by this is bin sh okay so uh like in this way you can simply like add a user you know in your system now to change the password or assign the password what you will need to do password command you will use sudo password we're not password let's write same without Virat okay password data successfully now the other file which come enroll in this user creation process that is Shadow file in Shadow file what happens like um all the passwords are stored in the hash format okay now let's take a look at the shadow file so as you can see permission denied so what I can do I will just use sudo because now I will run this command as on behalf of the root user now it will ask you for the password just enter and here you can see Virat okay so Virat is there and this is the hash format of your password okay and uh next here is the when password created or passwords in expiry right not all things now let me open up this to simplify this uh yeah here you can see Mark dollar six dollar this is the whole day like hash format encrypted password you can say and this is the when last password was changed then again their minimum password h and then maximum password H again warning period in activity expiration unused all these things is like in this Shadow file you can get but we have not assigned any kind of deals thing in like expiry rate all these things so that's why we are not able to see it so there are some encrypted password you can say what are the format like dollar type dollar short dollar hash is the format to a store your password so if it is 1 then it is md5 it is two way it is Blowfish this is uh 2y e case Blowfish you can say all this thing if dollar five and second is such a 256 and 512 now for dollar y it is the yes script so it is also one of the method you can learn about it and now uh if you will learn about the last password change on in this what happens it calculates from this state Jan 1 to 1970. okay and for expiry like it also like calculate from that particular day so I hope you got it the like what are the password file what are the shadow file if you want to take a screenshot you can take off this particular content so it will be helpful to understand you okay and for password you can just like you can take the screenshot of this particular part okay so now uh what we have to do we have successfully created this particular user now what we will do we are going to login okay we are going to login using that particular username and password so you can do SEO and uh username Virat and the password which you have set me that and here we you are in this particular user shell so here you can see who am I that is without if I'll do LS so you don't have permission because user simply just at the user adds a user so you will need to perform some other actions also okay so I will exit to from this cell okay let me clear the screen here also and now what I'm going to do I will just like use the other options which you can use with the user add command okay like there are multiple options which you can use okay so to create a home directory which option we use we use hyphen M option okay and to create a like user with your own user ID then we use hyphen U option okay and to add some command comments we use hyphen C option okay uh wait a minute hyphen C option so that's all and hyphen s option is also used to assign the login shell okay so uh we can use this one by one or in a single command also okay so uh for your Simplicity or will you like to make it simple I will use first one by one then I will like and everything in a single command now here I will I I'm creating hyphen name without two okay so permission denied so I forgot to use sudo I will use sudo and again you will write 2 has been created I will check the file Shadow file here we have not used password we have not set password yet sorry not Shadow I have to use password okay so as you can see VR2 has been created with the user ID 1003 and the home vrad to let's check whether this Home Direct applicator node I will do CD dot dot slash LS and here you can see VR2 has been created okay nice and I will now I will try to create some other user using iPhone M also and also I will try to use hyphen u i will assign some other idea like 1500 okay and also I will use hyphen C so okay so here this is Virat 3. and hit enter oh sorry uh yeah I forgot to change the name of the user we had three so user has been created successfully again password so here you can see we write three X password we have not set yet 1500 is the user ID and the group ID this is the additional information which you wanted to give that is Virat 3 home without three and Bin bin sh is there it should be bin bash to like reflect like this okay virtualbox so now what I will do I will use hyphen s option let me increase this maximize it okay so hyphen C you have used and let's use hyphen s let me clear the screen first what happened wait a minute okay hyphen s okay what I'll do I will first copy you can copy using Ctrl shift C yeah now I will do Virat 4. okay so sudo user at hyphen name what this it will do it will just like create a home directory hyphen U for assigning uh the particular user IDI so 1500 we have already assigned let's assign like 1500 oh sorry 1500 one this is Virat 4 iPhone has been bash without four okay we will hit enter and user has been created let's check in this particular file cat slash CTC slash and here you can see we are at 4 1500 one this is without four home and let's check home as the way character not home directory so here you can see without four has been created now what we will do we will change the password of this particular user that is without food so how you can do it using sudo command sudo password we are at 4 done now what you will do new password just enter anything which you want without I'm just typing and password has been also added now what I will do I will try to access the shadow file so instead of file you can see the hash format all these things okay so now what I will do I will just try to login using the Virat 4. SUV rat 4 is oh sorry and then again enter the password and I think I haven't entered wrong password okay no no sorry its password is only Virat okay okay let's again change the password Y2 okay caps lock is enabled no no no again change the password I forgot every time to use sudo now I will try to switch user okay so now where are you in the Virat for home directory if you will do PWD you are in Virat 4 if you will do who am I you are in without four okay so congratulations you have successfully created one user and you have like you have all you have set the password of it you have created the home directory for it everything okay done so now what you can do um uh what you can do now yeah so uh you can see the multiple process we did in this like first we created user using user ad then we provided using hyphen apps option to create home directory then for the shell we use iPhone S option for command we use iPhone 3 option and for and what else we used for uid you used hyphen U option okay so these are the multiple options you are using the user add command so basically user add command is the low level utility which means like it is earlier used but now it's there is also other utility that is add user there is a high level utility you can see okay so this is also useful because sometimes in kind of automation thing you need it okay oh I do yeah but you should know this method also so now moving forward what I am going to do I'm just let me like list all the so we are two three four has been getting 15.1 okay so now what I'm going to do I'm going to add a user using the simple command that is uh add user command okay so how you can do it sudo add user and the username which you want to give I just want to give as a search in okay what it is showing me please enter a username matching the regular expression configured here's the iPhone 4S okay I think I'll need to write as a small case in yes so here you can see you can't use capital letter okay so here you can see adding users searching adding a new group such in here group is also added I didn't talk about group in this video I will talk about in the later video okay and then you have to here only you have to enter the password like uh and again you have to enter the password and here if you want to give full name you can give a chintendo room number one two three work phone seven eight nine four five six one two three yeah oh sorry sorry one two three four five six seven eight nine zero home number zero nine eight seven six five four three two one other two nine years if you if you didn't enter anything it will be blank okay other is the information correct yes obviously why so now user hasn't created so this is a very simple command like in just one command you can create uh you can set the password you can add if any extra information you want to add okay so using this command you can simply do those things okay so if I will check the content or password so here you can see Sachin 1004 has been idea assigned to Sachin full name their phone number whatever it is room number home number and the directory directory has been also created let's check LS so here you can see Sachin and now let's login using searchin now you are here and if you will do LS so there is nothing any file so in this way also you can add users okay so that's all for today's video guys I hope you liked it and if you have yeah if you have any queries then please you can ask us in the comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video with another concept so that's all so thank you thank you guys for watching this video and we'll meet in the next one thank you in this video we are going to talk about groups okay what are the groups in Linux operating system so basically as the name suggests you can think like a group as a like a group of some kind of users group or politicians group of actors and this is the name suggest but any in Linux we can create different kind of groups like we can create separate groups for developer for pen tip from for pen test or the different groups and for marketing team different groups so basically this is the basically mostly use of groups like we can create different groups for different teams and we we can provide them the like different permissions according to their role so there is a basic simple command Linux like group AD okay using this command we can basically uh create groups in our operating system and I hope this is available to you let me increase the size first right it's too large let me hit this yeah now it's fine so how you can do it uh the one command which I told you right now it's group add and what you have to do you have to just provide the name of the group which you want so uh I will name it as a like Developers okay so here you can see it is showing permission denied so one thing here also is like uh the group group AD command is or can be or only performed by those users whether they are root or whether they have a certain permission of root permission or you can say whether they are in the pseudos file okay so in that file if any user in that particular file so they can easily use this particular uh feature of sudo command okay so I'm in that file like this user and yeah you show what I will do I will just add sudo and it will ask me to enter the password done and we are done here you are not uh getting any kind of output or something but let me tell you one thing like when you create this uh or when you add this group had a command or you add different groups so at that time what happened there are the two files which gets affected when you hit this particular command one is uh one is group which are located in the slash CTC directory and the one another is slash Etc G shadow okay so I will show you the con content of group file okay like in Shadow file it basically contains the like when you create a group with password and like they are not much required because like if there are multiple users then like your password will get uh like compromise you can think about of it okay so uh these are the two file which get affected when you whenever you create a group okay so let me show you the content of first CAD slash Etc like group file and here you can see there are the multiple groups here okay there are multiple groups the first group it may be root okay this is the root and these are some system users and here in the last video we had covered our Vita two three four so whenever you add a new user then the separate groups is also created okay so right now what we have added we have added developers okay so developers is one of the group and X is for password and this is the group ID okay so let me show you the detailed information about this particular file so that will be more clear for you guys okay so in this picture you can see like CDROM x 24 and this will be a question these are the users but in our case users are not visible why because we have not still added users in our group so we will do this in our next video okay so in this particular video we will only create groups like we will say different options how you can do it and here you can see the like detailed information about that particular file so here you can see those CD term is what just the name of your group like here you can see one indicates the group name like it is the name of the group if you run LS and this command you will see okay and then this is for password which we have not provided this is the GID that is a group ID and the group list like who are the users present in this particular group I hope that is clear to you okay so now what I will do uh I will try to create a group with some another GID okay so for this we can use the only one option is there that is hyphen G option which will help you to create uh like um group with different GID okay so but before that I want to I wanna show you one more option that is hyphen f option what it does sorry basically when you want to create a group with the same name then let's see what happens okay so I'm going to enter the same command again let's see what happens here you can see group developer already exist but what if you want to like if you don't want to see this error message or you want to forcefully create that particular like developer group so in this case you can use which option you can use just hyphen f option hyphenator stands out forcefully okay or you can say Force so in this case what will happen I will hit enter and here again you can see same developer 1502 okay so now in this key now what I will do wait a minute why my screen is not okay okay so now what I will do I will try to create a group with some different GID okay so how you can do it uh for this we have a hyphen G option group AD and still I will use hyphen egg option because I don't want to create some other groups I would just want to work on this particular developers group hyphen app then I will use hyphen G and I will provide this 2000 let's provide it 2022 and the name is Still Remains same that is developers and I have not added photo it's more important with the help of sudo you can perform anything in Linux just hit enter and then again we will see the content and here you can see okay it our GRE not added here okay let me check now we have entered collect command or not oh yeah there is a hyphen G option is correct okay let's try to create different group testers okay so what happened like when we we were using hyphen option then in that case we cannot change this GID but with other when you will create new group then you can uh change it like this tid like you can create your uh you you can create like a group with your own jid okay so like in this way you like you learn something new like you can't do like that if someone asks you to perform the same thing then you can use this and why it is not possible to change this GID using iPhone option so uh now what we I will do uh there is also one command that we can use like uh like for getting the list of users what I'm typing I am typing this cash slash Etc group okay but instead instead of this we can use the one command that is g ENT and then group and here you will get get the list of all the groups which is present in our system okay and to delete the groups you can easily uh delete it using the group Dell command that is very simple that is what I will group tell and I will just pass the name of the group which you want to date I want to delete testers and hit enter again permission United why because I am not your sudo let's use sudo and then again get list of that get list where it is okay so here you can see tester has been removed so I hope you guys like learned about how we can add groups in our Linux system and but in our further video we will see like how we can add users in particular different groups like there is also a separate command for this task that is a user mod or you can say user modification also like there are many uh properties of this particular command we will learn all about this in the next video okay so that's all for it and we'll meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet you next one thank you this video we are going to cover the one command that is the user mod like as the name suggest it is the user modification command like with the help of this command you can modify the user details like their user ID you can modify their username you can modify or if you want to add those users into that particular group then you can also do it in this particular video so basically mainly we will focus like adding users into groups in this particular video in our next video we will try to cover the like extra things or whatever is the like user locking changing uid changing their uh what you can say uh their group name all these things we will cover in our next video so here is the scenario for you guys like uh there is a some kind of company and here you can see different teams are there like developer tester marketing team okay these are some kind of teams in that particular company and we have a different users like D1 D2 T1 T2 M1 M2 so basically suppose this is our uh some kind of Linux server and in which we want to create different groups so there will be separate groups for developer separate groups for tester and similarly for marketing game there will be a separate group and these are the users so now what we will do we will try to first of all create all these user all these groups then we will create users and then we will add these users into that groups using user mode command okay so now first what we will check if we have that group present or not I have sorry okay so here you can see uh there is no any other groups present like developers marketing team and all other groups okay so now what we can do we can try to add those groups so how we can do it you can do it easily by using group add command and I will try to give the uid that is 2001 and the name of the group that will be Developers okay so it is showing permission denied why because we have not added sudo here because it runs only if you have a permission like that user should be adding that suitors file so now I will need to enter my password and again let's check if this group is added or not so here you can see developers group has been added okay and 2001 is the GID and we have not still added any kind of user into this group okay so now let's uh create other groups um testers I will try to give you editors 2002. again permission denied okay added and now marketing team okay 2012 already just change the uid to three okay so now what we can do we can check if all the groups has been created or not so here you can see developers tester marketing team has been created now what we have to do we have to create all these users like D1 D2 D1 T2 M1 M2 okay but before creating group there is a one concept of primary and secondary group in all this Linux system so you will need to understand it first like basically what is primary group in primary group what happens when you create a one user or any new user so simultaneously a one group is also created with them like suppose I have created test okay a test user then test group will be also created okay so that is a primary group and what is a secondary group second group is nothing but uh like uh one user like will present in other groups also suppose this is a D1 user and he has a primary group of D1 and but he is also present in developer so developer is it's what secondary group okay have you gotten the concept of this okay so now what we can do I will add users so for users also we use sudo command and we will use add user command not user ad um name it as a D1 matching the regular expression okay so I think we cannot write the numerical uh Devo one okay should add user day one is knowledge okay let me check Okay add user that is sudo again I will try to create user oh sorry add user developer one okay so here you can see like developer one has been like username has been created now it is asking me to enter the password of that particular user so I will enter some kind like anything maybe which I want and full name um I don't want to give and whether this information correct or not yes it is correct so this user has been created like to verify whether user has been created or not what you can do like as we have earlier learned like when whenever we create a user then the information is get stored or get added into the password to file that is pass WD okay so we will check the content of that file sorry so here you can see our developer one has been created with the uid disk and 1001. GID what is Zid that is the group ID and this is uh his primary group okay so if you will check with the ID command of that particular user they were developer one so here you can see their GID is 1001 and their primary group is developer one okay and groups in which groups this user is present so basically it is present in only one group that is a developer one because we have not added this user into the developers group so now what I will do again I will create another user um developer to okay let's enter password I don't want to provide yes done again now I will create for tester tester one same sorry y okay tester has been added now tested to no full name nothing required yes okay we have already covered this user creation you can watch our previous video okay so uh these two users has been added let's again check the content of that password file so here you can see developer one developer 2 tester one tester 2 has been added again last one is remaining that is virtual marketing team Okay so uh where that last command which we have done okay I will just write mt1 password okay nothing is required yes again mt2 password uh enter anything which you want nothing required nothing and then yes okay so successfully we have created all these three users and the groups okay so as per this scenario like developer has developer one developer two tester one tester two marketing team one and marketing team too okay so now we will check whether all these things have been created or not for your like clarification cat slash CTC so here you can see all these six users has been created so now the main thing uh the main topic of our this video is user mode like user modification so now let's check the uh first of all check the like group of developer uh not developer let's check for tester one so here you can see GID is this and group is this is added only in this group particular and now let's check the like whatever the groups we have present so here you can see uh here one developers testers marketing team and also you can see developer one developer to this this and why why this is happening because these are the primary groups for that particular user like when you have created that developer one user then simultaneously another group has been also created okay that's why this is a primary group now what we will do we will add this developer one user into this developers group and then we will check that uh like check with the ID command like um what are the other groups in which that particular user is present okay so now the role of user mode begins so let's start with this so basically uh user mode we will use it uh like this like user mode and then we will provide the name of the group in which we want an iPhone a option hyphen a is nothing for the append option okay I hope you are aware of append like appending something like uh Suppose there is a some kind of content and you are just appending into something things in it okay you can think of it like that and we will use hyphen G option for the groups and the group name so what we want that is the Developers I think this is the same name if I am correct let me check it okay leave I'm correct I know uh developer one permission denied again because we have not used sudo here and now let's check the groups of this particular user developer one so here you can see like uh GID is 1001 and the groups which in which groups this particular user is present so here you can see developer one this is his primary group and developers is it secondary group okay so again let's add other users also like uh developer to I will add this user into this developers what you can say developers group added simultaneously we will add users and testers group uh after one return wrong name tester one okay added again for tester 2. added similarly for marketing team uh let me check the name of that particular group um marketing team okay and here you can see like in developers we have you can see like developer one has been added and developer 2 has been added similarly in testers we have tested one and tester two okay so now what we will do we will add users into the marketing team let me clear the screen and marketing team and a username was mt1 I think mt1 okay added and similarly empty empty two it was I think let me check the name of that particular user foreign so now again we will check so now here you can see the developers group like what are the users present that is developer one and developer two in similarly interested groups we have a tester one and tester two and in our this uh what you can see in the marketing we have uh M M1 and M2 okay so uh this is the like um thing which you should learn about like user modification like this is uh like what you can say important thing because when you will go in the corporate then maybe as a system engineer or whatever like a Linux administrator then at that time you will get to know about this these things okay so uh that's all for this video and for user modification command like there will be another video for for the details like how you can add the command add a uid and you can change the like old username to the new username so let me show you this command like how you can change it I have to change this M2 to m like marketing team two okay this is the user M2 and I have to change his username to marketing team too so how I can do it I will just use user mod and then I will use the option hyphen L and the old username is M2 and the new username what I want is marketing team 2. okay user mod what is it's showing user marketing team 2 does not exist why it not exist I'm just okay maybe the new name will come up here permission to denied shoulder okay again let's check the group name if it is changed so okay here you can see marketing two like M from M2 to marketing to the name of the username has been changed and also you can verify it from this uh our password file here you can see it is marketing too okay so that's all for this video and in our next video we will cover up the other options of user mode command Okay so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you so basically we have already covered that how we can add users into another group so now we will also like do some other operations like for this we will I will I'll just create another user uh I will use the command ad user using sudo and I will give it the name as a file name that's great create with the high command uh sorry a new password I command hi command I think yeah I have written correct I will not provide any kind of extra information just uh yes okay done so to check whether the user has been great or not what we do we check the this file that is hackerman has been created here you can see the with uid1008 and gid1008 okay so uh for login so how you can do it you can just switch user SEO hackerman and the password hi comment so here you can see we are in this the hackerman directory okay so when you do LS so nothing you don't have permission and less okay here you can see all those kind of things log out I will just exit Okay exit we use it for uh like uh close that particular session of that particular user so now what we can do we will just try to change the username of that not username I will add the first some kind of comments in that particular user so how you can do it user mode hyphen C so here I will use a hyphen C option okay to provide some comments so let me provide like uh I am a hacker okay and the name of that the particular user hackerman and I will use sudo like because we can't use normally this command okay so now let's check the sorry not I don't want to switch I need this one yeah so here you can see the comment has been added like I am a hacker so in this way if you want to like add some kind of comments like in our previous video you can see like uh there is a developer section and if you want to add some comment to that particular user then you can add like this is first developer this is second developer or his ID is this his ID this okay and kind of this kind of things you can do okay so now moving forward what we can do uh we can also change the uid what is uid UI is just the unique identifier number uh which you can change of any particular user which you want so how you can do it simple just provide a hyphen which option new Option and then uid which you want so right now what it is one double zero eight I will give it as two double zero it let's hit enter and again uh let's check this content of that particular file and it should be change yeah so here you can see 2008 this is the uid and what is this one double zero this is the GID okay but we have what changed we have changed the uid okay so uh we have covered now iPhone c hyphen U now moving forward and uh if you want to change the username of this particular hacker man like from a hackerman to if you want to change it like um best hacker like this like this kind of thing if you want to so how you can do it uh I will use again the C sudo user mod okay and I will use hyphen L option for changing the username iPhone L and the new username which you want I want sorry uh I want uh best hacker okay I will hit enter and again check here so here you can see the name from hackerman to best hacker like it has been changed so in this way you can also change the like username of your uh okay you can change the username of your particular user if you want okay and also you the most like important thing is here you can use hyphen e option also okay uh hyphony option what it will provide it will just add the like expired date like when that user should be get disabled so you can do it using the just one option that is a user mode hyphen e e stands for expiry and the particular date on which you want okay so today is uh 28 I will provide it as a 30 okay 30 now not in this I think year month and then 2022 and then month that is it and 30 okay I will hit enter and the high command doesn't exist yeah because we have changed the name from hackerman to which best hacker best hacker done let's check whether it is reflecting or not it should okay but here it is not reflecting it reflects and writing Shadow file okay so uh in this way you can also add the expiry date and one more like important command is that locking and unlocking of user account now you can do it in this so for this option we use the capital L option okay to lock a user so in this what happens like uh the that user can't log in using the username and password like but other methods are required like key based or switching user like which we did here earlier okay so to log the user what we can do user mode iPhone l uh capital and the best hacker permission denied why we have not used sudo hit enter we have logged the user if I will try to not right now first of all I have to delete some users like I'm Linux marketing these all the users I want to delete uh how you can do it sudo user Dell uh I am Linux marketing maybe a simultaneously if I um I don't know I can do or not mt1 tester two tester one develop one developer 2. okay but I don't think I'm succeed or not I don't think okay so now I am not like able to like delete that users like simultaneously okay so I will need to do one by one let me do it first because I have to show you like I am not able to log in using the username and password okay so the user Dell developer one again develop it developer to again tester one extra two marketing what is the name of the user that mt1 done again it is marketing something marketing to done I am Linux I am Linux done okay so we have deleted all the users like XI users which we had created earlier okay so now let me check the again that file okay so here you can see on the best hacker is there so now what I will do I will try to like uh switch user from here okay uh wait a minute it's like yeah not listed it's not showing yeah and it is not showing okay so when we will unlock then we will try to check whether it is uh like visible or not that option of particular that user okay so I think if we have logged it that's why it's not visible to us okay so uh now to unlock the particular user what you can do you can you have to just use hyphen you option okay but before that I will show you this one like if you are able to switch or not uh I don't think we are authentication failure okay okay authentication failure will be there yeah I'm correct so now what if we have blocked the user now what we can do we will provide this hyphenue option it will unlock the user okay so again let's check whether we are able to log in or not so now now we are able to login so when you log the user you can't just um login or anything for like using username and password okay so here also if we try to check whether the name of that particular user is available or not switch user just wait for a minute like it takes some time so here you can see I am a hacker white song because we have added that comment okay so where it is showing okay but I am still logging into my account oh I have added wrong okay so uh that's all for this video guys I hope you learned about like how you can uh edit the username add comments uh like editing username like mostly we want to edit okay and uh most and we will not use a hyphen L option like we don't want to lock anyone okay so uh you can do it or if you have guys any problem with this particular video or our previous video then you can ask us in our comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and if you have not subscribed our Channel then please subscribe it guys okay thank you this video we are going to cover about uh head command okay so head command is nothing but a simple command that we basically use to get the uh starting content of a particular txt file okay so uh when we will demonstrate and then you can easily get okay so let me open up the terminal I hope it is visible to you okay all right first create One Directory with a head okay and I'll create two files touch now I will create with cat command cat States dot XD okay and already I have entered the whatever the states okay I will just copy it here and I will paste it there okay enter Ctrl D to save and I will again create another command that is a capital.txt okay let me like this and again I will copy from this okay Ctrl D okay so we have created two files you can check with ls command if I will try to read the first here you can see and if I try to read second file that is capital here you can see okay so now we will use the head command okay so what I just said you like what is the head command hit command is nothing but which we use to print the starting content of a file so how we can get it so simply the command is head and just provide the file name whatever it is sales.txt till suppose okay I print uh I will hit enter and here you can see the first 10 lines you will get so by default what happens when you use the head command you get the first 10 lines of our txt file so you can count here also like one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten okay so this is the one of the feature of the head command okay so if you want to like suppose you want to print only first two lines okay for this what you can do you have to nothing just provide the like hyphen air option or you can do it add iPhone and 2 and States Dot txt so here you can see we have only just got the only first two lines if you want to print first five lines then also you can do it like form five okay so and what if you want to like uh get the content of two files simultaneously how you can do it so it's also a simple command of it is like a head hit enter so here you can see the first 10 contents of both the files okay so now what if you want to print only first five or first five line of both the files so you can see here you can see three plus two five three plus two five okay so here we are getting five lines and here also we are getting five line so with the help of iPhone and option we can easily uh get uh whatever uh number of lines which you want to like display in the on this terminal okay and also there is another option that is a hyphen C option what it does so hyphen C option is nothing but like which we we use to get the uh like content of a particular size okay suppose if you want to print the content of only first like 30 bits or 10 bits so then for this we can use the hyphen C option okay so uh let's use it iPhone C I will provide uh so States dot txt so here you can see a and d h why this because this is only four bytes okay first four whites it will provide us and what if I want to hit 12 so here you can see it is just me providing me the 12 bytes okay this is a three three six seven and again this is five seven plus five that is a 12 bytes okay so in this way you can use the hyphen 3 option and also you can see use I think together also for Capital let me use and as you can see in a stress dot txt you are getting this and in hazarable you are getting this okay so uh and also there is one more option is remaining in this like hyphen V option what it does it basically just provide you the verbose information and hyphen us stand from verbose which basically shows you the like information about execution of command like that let me use it for States so here you can see stress dot tx3 like if we not use hyphen reaction then let's see what happens nothing okay so that's all guys for this particular video so I hope you liked it and we will meet in the next video okay so thank you thank you for watching now in this particular video we are going to learn about the tail command okay so similarly just like a head command L is also one command bin but in this we are like expect output from the downside or you can say the we try to get the output from the bottom of the txt file or any file like from which we want to like extract some kind of data like suppose you want to extract data from a log file like you need a last 10 number of lines if you need okay so in this case we can use the tail command okay so uh the basic uses like you can try to learn about uh like how you can read the log file using tail command and all these things so these are the basic uses of this so I have already two files uh stressed or text and capital.txt okay so let me show you these two files so this is the content of States Dot txt and this is the content of capital.txt okay so on these two files we are going to use the TL command okay so I will use first tail command on the stress dot txt so what it will do let's check so it will just print the last 10 lines okay so here you can see it is just printing the last 10 and you can like get the one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten okay so using the simple tail and the file name what you will get you will get that by default last 10 lines but to suppose if you want to more more lines so if you if you want 15 lines so how you can do it so nothing you just have to use iPhone n option and provide the number of lines which you want so I just want 15. so here I got the last 15 lines okay so you can use hyphen n option to get the last number of lines and similarly there is option of hyphen C option like which will provide you the like what you can say last number of specific bytes if you want suppose if I want uh 13 bytes I will use just hyphen C and 13. so you can see I'm getting just West Bengal let me try higher number 16 again I think I will get same okay nothing uh I I got like this West Pangolin and okay suppose if I want uh 20 bytes uh sorry if I want how much 20 so as you can see I'm getting 20 bytes let's count like w one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen eighteen and also there will be like some kind of particular size for the spaces also okay so in this way we are getting the 20 bytes like specific bits okay not bits bytes it is okay so you can use the iPhone C option to get the specific number of bits okay from a txt file or any kind of file so now if you want to get the like last 10 lines of both files or you can get it just simply use this command stress dot t uh hyphen n and the number of lines then provide the files file name which you want so I need data from two files so you can see you can get easily like from capital.txt these are the last 10 lines and from stress dot txt these are the last 10 lines okay so apart from this uh there is also uh like a very interesting thing in which you will learn in this particular video that is a monitoring any like any txt file Suppose there is a log system or something like that and if you want to monitor it so how you can do it you you can use it just by applying tail command by which option you can use by using hyphen f okay so let's do it tail hyphen app states.txt okay so uh first let me show you the content of stress.txt so that will be clear to you so as you can see at the end we have only West Bengal okay so now I will use tail hyphen f States Dot txt and here you can see like it has to enter the last 10 lines and it is my monitoring this file so now what I will do I will just open up the again new terminal I hope it is visible to you I will move into the head directory and I have these two files and what I am going to do I will append some data in stress.txt and then here we you can see if I write something then it should reflect here hello okay so you can see Hello has been added if I want uh if I want to print Linux Fair India so here you can see whatever I'm writing here whatever I'm adding in this particular file it is get monitored by this system like tell if we have used the hyphen have option to monitor this since.txt file so whatever we are doing changes in that particular file it is reflecting here so in like this you can also use this particular thing in the like log monitoring system okay so have you liked it like that was the interesting part of this particular video I hope you liked it suppose we write anything else okay so here you can see it is getting like reflecting here okay and all these things will get added into this particular stress or text file now I will just save it and now again I will try to check the content so here you can see all those extra content has been added in that particular stress.txt file so that was the like most important or you can say most interesting thing of this particular video so I hope you liked it and please if you have any queries regarding this video so then you can ask us in the comment section okay so we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching in this particular video we are going to cover about the CH own command that basically make change ownership command okay so before starting uh let me tell you the brief or a little bit introduction about this command basically it means what as the name suggests that change ownership what does it basically means uh let's take a scenario of a corporate world okay in which you are working in a team and there are people with different roles okay and if you have access of some kind of file and you want to share that file to some another team okay so in this case you can use the CH own command okay like there will be a one particular group for or one team and you want to give that access to some other team member or some other group member you can say okay so it basically means changing the ownership of a file or transferring the ownership to some other people or to some other user okay so we will start this uh okay so but before starting uh I will tell you to just set up your root account okay but because we will use root account and also want another user to perform this ah particular ch1 command Okay so to set up a root command first of all what you have to you have to just change the password if you don't know so enter the password command and the username that is a root and you have to just use a sudo and and now you can enter the new password which you want okay password related successfully and one more thing what we have to do I will add another user add user and I will give the name as a Avinash okay so enter a password I will not provide any kind of information okay yes okay so user has been created now what you will do first login as a root in this terminal uh wrong password I enter wrong password yeah now I'm logged in as a root user here you can see root and now again I will open up on another terminal in which I will log in with the credential of Avinash uh I hope it is visible to you now yeah it should be visible to you guys so now what we have to do uh we have to just log in as a different user that is a uh Avinash okay just enter the password of that particular user uh test uh Avinash okay so here we you can see uh I have another user in this terminal and another user in this terminal okay so this is the root user and this is the Avinash user okay so now both the user are in the home directory let me do here also same thing okay so with both the users are in the home directory okay so now what I have to do to see the permissions or to see anything uh permission of a file or directory or anything else which you want what what command you enter just you enter LS iPhone lyl just a long listing of files you can say like that okay so here you can see we have three directories and these are the some permissions based on those directory that is rewrite execute read ER and then for others there is no any permissions okay but these are the regarding what you can say these are regarding your um users like this is the user static tree but we don't have to work on this I will work on some different directories or different files okay so what I will do I will just create a one file that is touch file.txt and I will do LS hyphenyl and that particular file name so here you can see in this case uh if you have watched our previous videos on permissions okay so I think you will get it easily so these three represents the permissions of users and this is for groups and these are from others user so here you can see uh groups has only read permission and other others also has only read permissions okay but uh this particular user has a read and write a permission okay so who is the owner right now the owner right now is root root is the owner right now okay so now what uh you have to serve suppose or you have to think like that you have to share this file.txt to someone else to Avinash okay this user you have to share now what will happen list to a lesson I will try to access this file so I hope I can access because others have read permissions so let me hit enter this command so here you can see we have not got any error like permission denied so now what I will do I will just add one line in this particular file hi this is root user Ctrl D to save okay and now again I will try to access and here you can see I am able to access this file but if I will go to change the permission in this particular file then at that time what will happen if we will get an error of permission denied why why we will get error the reason behind is this that we don't have execute permissions okay so now what we have to do uh if I will try to add some extra lines in this file.txt so how we can do file.txt let's see if we are able to add or not so here you can see permission denied so okay as I said earlier like if we don't have permission like execute permission so to change the to change in the file okay so to do this we have two options one is change ownership just for one particular user or simply add execute permission for others using uh CH command okay change permission right CH mode command okay you can use that command to change the permission for all the users but that is not a useful case or that is not a best scenario because you don't want to share that file to all the users okay so that's why ch1 command came into this role and that's why we are using it so how you can do it just use CH own and whatever username you want to uh here our username is uh this particular username is I uh Avinash show Avinash and I will just provide the file name and done now I'll do LSI funnel and here you can see Avinash is now the uh new owner of that particular file so LS iPhone let me do two one more time yeah here you can see Avinash is the new owner sorry and now if I will try to change in this particular file then obviously I will be able to change here I will add just this line has been added by Avinash Ctrl D2 save and again I will try to access and here you can see this line has been added by which user Avinash okay we can also use multiple options with the ch1 command like ch1 hyphen C for uh what you can say for informations okay like it will display just like uh information like uh permission has been transformed from this user to this user let's do this uh with this again let's hope it works or not let's see CH on hyphen C and I will provide the username that is Avinash and file okay it's not showing me where do we okay ownership file.t extra detained as Avinash okay and you can see we have used iPhone V for warbus and it just displays the extra information um yeah it's still Avinash Okay so no worries so in this way CH own command works okay so I hope you like this video and I hope you got the concept of how ch1 works okay so that's all for today's now in this particular video we are going to cover about the CH group command it basically means the change group or you can say in the change group ownership okay from one group to another okay to understand this uh command just think like a basic scenario Suppose there is there are the two teams in a company that is the one for uh tester and another for the you can say a red developer okay suppose uh tester wants to share uh one file or to some other group members that is uh they these are some kind of group members okay so uh not for a particular member of that group but this team tester team wants to share those file to all the groups so in this scenario we can easily use this CH group command okay so in this kind of scenario it will be helpful because you don't have to share that file to one particular user okay so that if you share that file or change the ownership from from file to that group so every member of that particular you group can easily access the we can easily access that particular file okay so to understand the scenario first what we will need to do we will first need to create a group okay I hope it is visible to you guys uh so to add groups what is the command so the command is nothing but the group add and group name okay so what we will do group add and let's make a group name as a Developers foreign foreign sorry I went to wrong password I think yeah group has been created uh now what I will do I will just uh create two users add user user one again we have to use sudo password no extra information I have to provide yes user one is added user two test test yes both the user has been created now what we have to do we have to just uh add those two users into the developer group okay so how you can add those two user into a developer group so for that also we have a particular command that is a user modification so I will use pseudo user mod hyphen a and uh we use I think High fungi and the group name is developers and the name of the user that is a user user 1 and user two I hope it should work again not working user one if I provide I added and again use the two okay so groups has been added these two users have been added to the developer group to check what you can do and group okay so here you can see user one and user two and in developers we have two users that is user one and user tool okay so uh now what we have to do uh I will create a one file with our root user so first of all what I will do I will change my like switch to the root user I will go move back to directory in LS okay we have file.txt I will first remove file.txt and test okay both are due now what we have to do I will create one file that is Touch file dot txt okay so if I will change check the permissions for this particular file so here you can see we have root root the user is root and the group is also root user so in this case what we have to do we have to just change the group ownership not user like this one we have to change this group ownership to some other users or to some other group so but in this case here you can see in the permission we have the group has only read permission okay so now what we can do uh we can change the group from root 2 which group that is a developer group so for this we have a command that is CH group so how you can do it CH group ch grp and the group name is Developers okay developers and then what we have to do we have to just provide the file name okay now I will do LS hyphen and file.txt and here you can see the group name has been changed from root to developers okay so now what I will do I will login using uh both the user Su user one and I will enter the password test and again one more terminal I will open up here uh like this I will increase the font size so it should be visible to you and SEO which user that was user 2 okay and again enter the password same thing move back here also the same thing I will do I will move back on directory and I will do LS hyphen L and file.txt and here you can see developers and again here Developers okay wait a minute what key I just entered here LSI funnel file.txt okay so here you can see above in both the scenario we are getting developers as a group okay so now what I as a user one I will try to like change the some file content file.txt and here you can see it is showing me permission denied why it is showing permission denied because here you can see we have not added any kind of permission he has just read permissions okay so now what we can do uh okay so we have only the read permission here for the groups okay so if I will just uh try to access so I can just only read this file.txt but if I want to uh add some kind of text or add something in that particular file so here you can see the permission is denied so now what we will need to do we will need to just add permission for the groups for that particular file okay so how we can do it using the CH mode command just because uh we don't have uh like execute permission to the groups that's why we are getting this error so CH mode of what you have to do for Group G plus I will do uh write an execute and I will remove the read permission uh for others and the file name that is file Dot txt and done and now in this case I will just read check so here you can see uh read write execute has been added for groups and uh read has been removed from for others okay and the group is developers as we performed earlier so now what we can do uh if I will try to access this file that file file.txt so now let's try for user one I will remove all those things so cat file dot txt so here you can see I will just hide this line has been entered by user one Ctrl D to save and again here also uh I will I will here I will try to access this file ah sorry file.txt and here you can see that line I am getting and for user 2 also I will try to enter some line with respect to user 2 that is high this line has been added by user 2. Ctrl D to save and again I will try to access so let's access my user one not user one it's file Dot txt and here you can see both the lines has been added and it is accessible by both the users so this is the benefit of like group command like you can you don't have to share that file with each and every user Suppose there there is a team of 50 members okay so uh you you you can't like you can't just share those files to all those 50 people separately okay so that's why we have this group command change group ownership and just like that file will be accessible by each and every group member so guys that's all for today's video on this video we are going to start to post videos on networking okay like whatever the commands which are used in the networking domain now Linux operating system those are the commands which we will learn so for basically we will start with the First Command that is the Ping command okay so before starting uh the Ping command I hope you are aware of the basics of networking if not then let me tell you about like from scratch okay so these are the computers uh for support this these are the two computers okay and we are the two companies and they are connected to each other so now what happens in this case they basically form a kind of network what happens when multiple devices connected to each other okay so that process just called as a networking okay so in the networking there are many Concepts like uh what is an IP address what is a MAC address uh like uh different network topologies okay so we don't have to discuss that much thing particularly in this video so basically you just need about what is an IP address okay so uh let me tell you about the basics of IP address that you can think one of analogy is like uh what you can say just like in a family uh everyone has a separate name okay suppose one one name as ayush Ankita anything okay they are the siblings and they know each their names okay so similarly you know what network what happens each device has their own name or their IP address okay so basically and I bet it's just an address which identifies a device on a network okay I hope that is a clear to you so what is an IP address and also there is a concept of Mac address so my encourages you can think like of it as a fingerprint of a person suppose a person changes his name or her name but he can't change their fingerprint okay it will be always same so that's why Mac address is just like a permanent idea that is like a printed on your NIC card okay in your PC so now we will start with the Ping command ah let me enter the password I hope there are terminally visible or let me increase the font size okay so now what is a ping command so ping command is basically a simple command which you basically use to uh check whether the our like host is reachable or not suppose I will enter google.com so what google.com is kind of one of the host okay or you can see domain name so I will try to check whether I am able to reach there or not okay google.com so here you can see I am getting multiple uh requests from them now I will just hit Ctrl C to stop it okay so here you can see this is the 64 bytes uh like uh packet size what uh so now what is a packet okay so packet is basically just like a data you can think of it like a data that is that transfers suppose you send a image then it can it gets divided into different small small packets or chunks then it is transferred so packet is just like a you can think as a small data okay so basically what happens when you ping uh and when you use a ping command so it basically what sends the icmp Eco request which basically means that is internet control message protocol request okay so icmp is just a one of a protocol that is used by the Ping command okay to like for that these are for this purpose like for receiving or for sending like Eco request and Eco response is one of the thing which comes in this role okay so whenever it's in that is called as the icmp equal request and whenever it received and that is called as the icmp equal response okay so there are multiple attributes here you can see like what is this uh sequence number dtl okay so I will cover like most important things first this is from it means it is just and the what you can say it is just the IP address of this Google.com okay so google.com is identified by this IP address like from where this request is coming that is 64 bytes is coming from where so it is coming from this IP address this is maybe the domain name or something like that or servers maybe we don't know about it what is this okay image domain from where this is coming but we know that this is the IP address IP address of this Google.com this is what detail is nothing but a time to leave it basically means like how many hopes or how many routers uh this process has covered okay and time is just like uh how much time it took to get the response or send the response it basically means what happened the total time so first this is our PC this is google.com Okay so it will ask for are you there are you alive or not Google reply and Google will just reply yes I am alive okay so uh this is the total time that is uh here it is where it is uh here this one this is 133 millisecond okay so at what happens at in one second there at least I think four to five packets or request four to five request as the end okay so being company we basically use for the like intent connectivity purposes further we will check about another commonly the Trace Road ipconfig if count if config sorry we will learn about all those things I hope uh you liked this video and now in this video we are going to talk about the most important command that is the trace root command okay so now in this video we will discuss about this particular command so before starting the actual implementation of this command let me discuss with you the like basics of this Trace root command okay so what are the basics of Trace root command as the name subject suggests Trace root what does it mean it just means you are tracing a root okay uh just uh think like an example like you have to go from like uh Mumbai to Bangalore okay so you can go from different routes and you will first Trace like how you can go to that destination okay so Trace root is a command which is used to find the what are the number of hopes hopes means you can say number of routers which are included between your source and the destination okay so we will start with this so basically uh actually I have an image for you also like Suppose there is a source and this is the destination and these are the number of routers included between the source and destination okay so Trace router which will tell you like what are the number of hopes present between source and destination like in our list today's implementation we will see uh like uh the number of Hoops which will be uh included between all this local machine and the google.com Okay so for the in Ubuntu actually trace route does not come with preinstall so we will need to install it like if you hit this command then you will get uh this error message or you will get a citation too first enter this command to install Tracer so we will do this sudo apt install tray so deputy just a packet manager you can say okay and password and now it will install your Trace root command okay so it will take a little bit of time let's wait for it so it's also just like a trace root command just also you can say like a ping command okay like we can use it also for checking the weather uh the particular server of particular host is reachable or not okay so uh now we will start with the Trace would command Okay so first of all uh I will clear the screen and hypo review visible to you so Trace root google.com okay so here you can see the first four page 10.0.2.1 it's like basically the uh what you can say gateway address like the first address through which my piece is getting connected and the star means like it is whether we are not getting any response or something like that okay so here you can see we didn't get any kind of response I don't know why uh this is it's showing me star star and the star means unreachable host so you can say like uh or not on reachable it means like you are not getting response okay and the maximum hopes uh can be it will try for 30. okay uh let me again check whether management is working or not okay internet is working fine okay five packet transmitter five receive zero percent loss let me try with again Trace root with a DNS server let me try first gateway again same that star means like not responding uh here you can see the maximum of hops can be 30. okay at least it should show something okay let's hope okay so it's still uh as trick so it's not strict by not getting response okay let me check the network setting here okay it's some Breeze adapter okay uh let me try again Trace root google.com first we'll get it okay yeah now now we are getting you here you can see from second and third hope so we are not getting any kind of response so asterisk basically means uh we are not getting any response from that particular router or you can say oops okay so now here you can see the first gateway like Gateway and Gateway just means like though very first router or very first uh you can say what you call the gate like through which your packet will pass like the very first router you can say Gateway just like a your first router okay suppose you are connected to a hotspot okay then your phone will be off it will act as a first router okay first gateway or whether your phone is connected to the your ISP or anything else you can say or just take an example of your WiFi if you're connected to a WiFi then the first request will be passed through your WiFi then it will be connected to some another router then another router then another option okay then finally you will reach to the destination so here you can see uh we are getting many results here like uh I think we have covered approx of 14 hopes here okay let's check whether it will come in one line let me increase this okay I think now it's better yeah uh so now here you can see the first gateway like from which we are getting the response and these are the time like uh what you can say uh ground trip times like from like when we go and then when we come back then the overall time okay so here you can see uh the different IP addresses of different routers then the total time taken by them these are all the details you can see and I tell us here you can see we reached to the destination okay and uh okay wait is to the destination yes so it overall take 84.1 for one millisecond okay so again let me try with uh some other uh website like let's take our IBM ibm.com I think my internet connectivity is slow today that's why taking much time so you can see you are getting different uh IP addresses of different routers okay let's wait okay so we have covered seven ropes 10 11 12 13 we are not getting any kind of response again no no response no response we're getting oh my God okay maximum hope is 30 so I don't think it will get complete okay okay no problem let me think about some other website uh Which is popular one uh let's take uh which website should I take man Trace food let me search for a new website booking.com okay let's check for booking.com booking.com foreign like here you can see like all this line represents the information about that particular hopes like the fifth one is the type address of that okay this like two two three Dot 196.2.5 okay and also it shows us the round trip time rounded up I hope you got it like uh from sending packet to receiving back like from requesting to response okay this is the round trip time so here you can see we have got still uh seven hopes uh let's wait let's eat now okay I think we have reached like we're getting the booking.com so approximately we have reached okay now it will get uh yeah completed okay so here we are not getting any kind of responses from the particular uh what you can say particular hopes why it happens it may be because of they are unresponsive or they are turned off or whether it's also because of the firewall regions like some of the firewalls does not reply back to this ping requester or icmp packet here also interested also we are sending that that icmp packet like internal what the what was the full form that it is internet control message protocol yeah we can say it like that okay so some of the routers are not routers some of the firewalls does not reply back to those packets that's why we are getting this it may be a one kind of region or whether they are returned over we don't know okay but still here you can see we have approximately released because the head I can see the domain name of their of their website that is booking.com okay so it may be one of the reason uh also we can use uh some different options with this stress root command like hyphen n options for like better View and let's try uh with hyphen and what looks like let's try okay okay now damn as you can see like uh as soon like very fast we got the result so you can see 192 uh first hope second third on responsive one not eight dot 170.248.21 on whether it is the our last node uh let me check with ping I don't think because it started with 142 yeah okay so this is not the address which we were expecting um but 142.251 okay so here it should show me that particular uh like the last IP address I was expecting this address okay let's try with uh other website yahoo.com not Yahoo it's Yahoo okay I have not used hyphen and option let me use that okay so here also we can see like 74.60 Dot like uh here you can see the first and Octane and second octet is same then we can we are in in the network we can say like that okay so basically like this would come and just use to find a number of hopes which um lies between the source and the destination okay so we are getting asterisk and not getting responses just because of their firewall uh settings like uh it shows us the like don't reply to the icmb packet equation maybe for the security regions uh because there is a tool in our Linux or Curry Linux system that is the nmap which we use for the network scanning okay so we also face that error now because when we go with the network testing then in that case we basically get that error so that's why uh no any company or no any organization want to uh what we can say they don't want to replace anyone you can say like that okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and yeah if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section yeah but before ending this video I have to show you one more thing for you like for Windows I know it's still uh in a series but uh day suit is a command which we can use on both windows and the Linux but in Windows we just use this one Trace CRT and again let's enter google.com and here you can see the first hope it is taking 32 to millisecond 2 millisecond and the IP address the IP address of the first rope okay so let's wait for some time it I don't think it will take much time uh okay for second hop request timed out again yeah yeah I will take this I don't think more than 15 seconds now so here also it is just sending the icmp packet request okay when we will start with the networking if in future then you will get to know about the what are the different protocols used okay like for web we use HTTP https protocol and also we use different uh for remote connectivity we use SSH FTP so we will learn all about these like how we can do with all these in our ax operating system let's wait now eight hops I think in Windows it's working fine um now nine it is unresponsive Maybe yeah to a state three and the third one will come up yeah and the tenth one is here let's check what will be the IP address of this k123 I just want to ask you one question like do you know about the uh IPv6 address if yes then yeah please comment comment about this IP address about IPv6 address Okay so okay finally I think we have reached to the destination with the number of hops is 14 okay yeah now now here you can see uh this is 142.250.192.46 it is the same IP address and the destination IP address is also the same okay so in this way uh we are getting uh like the number of different hopes like uh we started from first and till 14 we reached to that our particular destination so this is the beauty of this command okay so I hope you like this because at the end we got our like particular result like required result because it will show the like exact uh utility of this command like uh we are requesting for this and still again we are getting the same thing like we are getting the destination address the same as the IP address okay so that's all guys so if you have any query then please ask now in this particular video we are going to learn about one of the most important command that is the MTR command okay so basically uh MTR command is nothing but uh like combination of the two commas which we have learned in our previous videos that is the Ping and the trace root command so now in this video we are going to learn about uh this and we will use like see the both the features of the pink command and the trace route command in this particular single command okay so let's start with the basic like what we have to write that is MTR and enter the then host name I will just go with google.com and hit enter okay so here we you can see like uh this is refreshing again and again and again okay so basically what's happening here you can see the uh you will get the percentage loss and all the what are the number of packets and whatever has received average based and all these things okay so basically What's Happening Here you here you can see the number of hops like from our what you could say from our source to the destination okay so there are approx 10 hops here in this case so uh like basically with this command you are getting the overall uh what you can say overall statistics and what happens in this particular command as you can see this page is refreshing again and again and again so we started from zero and now we are still at here you can see we are at uh 48 again 49.50 so what is this happening this is basically nothing but uh the Ping request okay so here uh this command like what it does it sends pin request again and again and again so uh with pink Rick is what we send we send the which protocol we use icmp like internet control message protocol we use okay so uh here you can see that again I will like uh run this command to stop this we have to just hit Q and it will stop okay again let me check with the for another domain uh let's try for gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try for facebook.com so here you can see here also we are getting a 10 hops so there is no any packet loss here in this case okay so this is the again at 11 times that is 13 14 15 16 all these things you can see so to control the your what you can say ping request time like suppose you want to Ping again after some some after some seconds like suppose you want to Ping after two seconds so how you can do it so for this we use a special function not function we will say just it is uh just an option that is a hyphen I option okay so let's use that MTR hyphen I and we will specify the time for 2 second and for domain name let's go with the YouTube okay so here you can see now it's not like earlier like it's sending the Ping request after two seconds so you can see the like change in the frequency of sending packets okay so here you can see F4 now seven now eight so it's slow slower than earlier okay so in this way you can control the ping request and here you can see the IP addresses of all the hopes which are which lies between our from the source and destination okay so and now moving forward uh suppose if you want to uh display only the what you can say only iPad is not host names like actually we are getting here uh IP area but still there is option of hyphen and so we will use it let me clear the screen MTR hyphen n and uh let's take some basic one uh our Indian website let me search not brave let me open Chrome okay I will search for let's search for blockchain so here okay here is the one website Investopedia okay or here is also blockchain.com is also one kind of website let's let me check it as I've yeah it's live okay we can find the IP and all what are the hops present between this so let me go like this first blockchain.com okay accessible one zero four okay okay now what I will do I will use the hyphen n option blockchain.com so here you can see only iPad is as earlier also we were getting only IP address but so what happens in some cases we get the host names okay we get the host names in place of these IP addresses okay so these are basically your ipv4 added whatever your 32bit addresses okay how we will learn about more about in networking part okay about ipv4 address and IPv6 address okay so moving forward in this video so we will go with uh one of the like uh option with in which we store the output in different different files like the different formats you can say like we can store in XML we can store ingestion and also we can store in uh like other videos file format we can say I'm not getting what are the file formats let me check with uh okay so now here we will see uh what are the file formats so um hyphen B naught this one local environment packet okay CSV is also there okay here we can see if yeah here you can see iPhone iPhone XML is there we can use hyphen iPhone XML for storing the output in like this okay so let me try with this hyphen hyphen XML google.com whether I will need to provide path or not I don't know okay Ctrl C to stop take one minute I will create One Directory uh 3D blockchain and NTR iPhone iPhone XML google.com and now it will be sending like it's not displaying us here I will just hit Ctrl CLS okay no files has been created uh my front wall street.xml whether it's lock or not okay it's not working let me check okay uh let's try with CSV okay it's not printing anything I don't know what's the problem here uh basically what happens it displays the output in that particular format like if a head is CS with then comma separated values okay yeah okay we got it now so here you can see uh like this is the comma separated output in this case and if I will try with the XML uh actually uh file is not created the output is displayed in that particular format okay let's wait for two to three seconds so I hope it will work sweet okay so here you can see uh the output in the XML format nice okay so moving forward uh what I will do uh I will use some other function not function I will use some other uh options in which we can like uh create a one file in which you will add some domain names and then we will call that file and use this particular command what I'm just trying to say you let me create one file so just remember how you can create file in Linux we will just use Touch command okay I will enter domain Dot txt and I will write first google.com facebook.com instagram.com okay that's enough Ctrl D to save okay let me check the content of this file not 50 what was the name domain yeah okay here is the domain uh now I will use MTR I will use hyphen f capital F option and provide the uh domain.txt and then the just it I think that's it okay so here you can see we are getting result for google.com okay so here you can see the Ping request everything we can see here all statistics okay now further we will see how we can set the Ping okay so like uh normally what happens it sends approx 10 things request okay like one to ten okay if we want for only five how we can do MTR iPhone C5 google.com this is third fourth and the last one is fifth that's it so only five packets have been sent okay okay uh yeah again so here you can see this percentage loss here we can see the maximum percentage loss we don't know why and send okay wait a minute I have to just to explain some things that's why so this is the last the average time this is the best time the what what time I am trying to tell you like this is a round trip time like when the packet goes from the source to destination and then the packet like the DC sender receives the response from the receiver like that time that is a round trip time okay so this is the average best worst and this is the standard deviation okay latency is something uh this is the last one so guys that's all for this video and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video on this particular video we are going to learn about host command okay so basically this command is used for the DNS lookup it basically means you are going to find information about the DNS servers as well the IP addresses of a domain name or or domain name with IP address you can say so but before moving forward in this particular video you should know the basics of domain name server okay so this is basically one of the networking Concept in which we will learn okay in the following topics like I actually have written already one blog on DNS so you can go and learn from this infosec writeups and if you will search for all about DNS 100 days of hacking you will get it let me search it for you in four SEC writeups okay so this is the first one write up by ayush Verma okay you can get it from here so let me tell you the basic idea of what is this domain name server and all these things so basically DNS stands for domain name server okay it means the whatever the your google.com it is a domain name it will get converted into the IP address or vice versa or IP address will get converted into the domain so with the main reason behind this is domain name service why this domain name server came in a role okay so just think like a normal human if you uh you are given one address like 192.168.42.35 whether this is easily remember easy to remember or google.com is easy to remember okay just think once so obviously you will say like sir google.com is easy to remember that's why that is the main reason behind this of DNS that's why it came in a role so we will see the basically working of how it basically works let me move down as here you can see the I have written like in more explanation I have given here you can learn it and also how it works I will tell you and this is the domain High key like root level domain top level domain second level domain like.com dot government Dot mil these are the root level domains okay and try hack my Google USA sub domains okay so you can learn all about these things and now let's moving forward to the working of this DNS okay so whenever user types in web address this particular grow my name what happens in this case it will first do the DNS query from where DNS resolver okay DNS is always also one of the part of this particular process where summary codes are stored now next what will happen it will send the request to this root server whether if the dominionadv.com or dot anything it will move to the root server it will ask for do you have this IP address of this particular domain if it will say yes then it will forward the request then again fourth step it will go with the TLD server and again with authority name server and after that it will go to the main server of that particular website after getting the IP address okay so this is the overall working of this domain name server and now we will talk about the what are the records in DNS okay so basically DNS request provide the information about the particular domain so I will like go down and let me tell you the records okay so these are the basically some of the records like a records this four a records I mix the chord c name record you can learn about these all things like 80 cost provide us the ipv4 addresses and AAA and also one more day that is a 4A record providers the IPv6 address MX3 cost provide us the like Mail Exchange address CNM record is also provides like like it points the subdomain to the main domain basically if there is a gmail.google.com or google.com both will point to the only single domain or it's not domain single IP addresses okay now moving this is the name server record that is NS records okay and txt record is some kind of record that administered some kind of text and all these things okay now let's move to our main motive of this particular video that is the host command okay so I hope you got to learn about all those things about DNS records I hope it is visible to you let me just increase the size first so that it will be easy to it will be easily visible okay so now let's enter the host and just provide the google.com okay oh wait a minute okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind of error okay host google.com Okay google.com not found why like this post okay it's working okay let me provide another iPad another domain name like let me provide Gmail .com host gmail.com not found okay why this is happening I'm not getting let me do first thing whether it's working or not okay temporary failure in name resolution let me ping another some domain name that is a uh which two menu should I let me check here medium.com let me do medium.com why it's happening I'm not getting uh let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine so that after it may be uh work let me do okay now I've started restarting my PC uh let me now perform the that command okay so I hope it is visible to you uh let's do host google.com okay so here you can see the address of google.com that is uh that is the ipv4 that is what does ipv4 address mean it means that it is a like 32bit ideas I guess okay if I'm not wrong let me check why to create confusion for you guys okay IP address bit size okay I hope it is 32 yeah I was connected okay it's 32bit address it ranges from 0 to 20 0 2 to double five okay so here you can see the IP addresses of google.com that is 172.217.27.2.6 and again with with same like you will get this IPv6 address so that this is the like version 6 addresses of google.com and the mail server address that is MTP now what will happen if you will think about the concept of DNS what is happening here is when you are entering google.com so that domain is mapped with this particular IP address this one let me copy this IP address and let me put it here what will happen whether it will go on to the google.com or not let's check foreign so here you can see that that IP address is mapped to the google.com that's why uh like we are going on this particular domain name what will happen if I will see I will just change it dot two zero six to two note five whether it will go to the same or different let's check okay it's going to the same because that per whole IP address may be belonging to that particular google.com let me do two double zero okay it's same okay so now uh let me go for some another domain also host uh let's go with medium.com like sometimes it happens like uh you can't go on a particular okay I press something like print okay when sometimes what happens when you enter the IP address of some of the domain name then at that time you will not be able to reach that particular domain because of firewall implementation and all so so here also you can see different IP addresses mail servers okay so let me check this one one five three Dot four okay let's check whether it goes or not okay so yeah here you can see the direct iPad is not allowed why because I think they are using cloudflare Cloud Player they are using yes your IP here I will get my IP address okay so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now moving forward in this particular video with the getting the DNS records of a particular domain name okay so how you can get it like uh using hyphen T option we can get and also if you want to get only the IPv6 address you can get if it is available so here you can see connection is refused now let's check with the CNM record okay so if you don't know more cname record you can go here and learn about it on this particular block okay domain to another domain for example you can see blog.example.com has a CNM record with a value of example.com This Means whenever DNS record hits the DNS record for blocked example it actually triggers another DNS lookup to which domain that is the example domain and it basically turns the IP of the same that is main domain name example.com domain okay so uh let's do the DNS look of all this particular record that is which one CNM record so the command is very simple host hyphen T C name and you have to just write any domain name which you want let's do with google.com okay it has no any record uh maybe it will be for medium let's check okay no records uh any website okay let me search for random colleges in Delhi if I get any college website now let's go with the siksha.com copy it and just paste it here okay so here we are getting the okay not found okay okay so these sites are not having any CM because let's go with some another record uh let me check with the MX record that is the mail action it should be there yeah it has a mixed record let's go for uh gold medium.com yeah they are using MX record okay and let's check for another record that is the txt record okay we are getting it here all those records uh let's check for okay another website that is structure hyphen ttxt record okay we are getting all those information whatever the actors stored in this particular text file in the DNS records okay so I hope you like this particular video and today we will stop here in the next video we will learn about something new okay so that's all for today's video and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you hello guys now in this particular video we are going to cover the ifconfig command basically it stands for interface configurator okay basically in this particular video we will be doing like changing the IP addresses and all those things and also this Commander basically we use is to find the IP address and the MAC address of particular machine so before starting what is the MAC address so macad is nothing but a particular 48bit address which we use to identify a particular device on a particular Network okay so basically this Mac address is printed on your Nic that is the Nic is the one of the card which attached to your to your computer or to your laptop then at this Mac address is like written hard coded okay so let's start with our video so I will just hit ifconfig so here you can see I'm getting different interfaces like enp03 and localhost and at this point of time I am getting this IP address this is provided by virtualbox and this is the IPv6 address and this is the my Mac address okay so don't worry I've changed it okay and this interface is for the localhost okay so uh basically this command provides us what information you can see here the ipv4 address ipvc and the Mac address okay so moving forward uh if you want to get the information of particular interface how you can do it if config and just write the interface name that is enp 0s3 okay here you can see the only uh like information about a single interface okay what is the interface just like uh suppose if you are connected to a VPN then another interface will be created okay so it just provides us the IP address of a particular Network in which through to which you are connected and on okay so moving forward uh if you want to change your IP address how you can do it so this command basically provides us this functionality also another command is IP Command which we will cover in our next video okay which which is similarly used for these purposes so first let's uh change the IP address of this particular command that is ifconfig and the interface name but before I will need to copy this interface name okay so let me clear the screen if config ifconfig interface name and then the I will provide one IP address let's do 192.168. uh Dot 255.0 and net marks we will provide like this determines the number of our machines which will be there on the network okay the operation permitted why because we have not used sudo so to change these uh things we we need a pseudo permission okay I will enter just password I hope I tied wrong password yeah No it should okay let me try it again yeah done now again I will check the IP address I if config and I'm here you can see the particular IP addresses and netbox okay so that's all for this particular video and we'll meet in the next video with another most amazing command so if you have any query then please ask in the comment section guys so thank you and thank you for watching we'll meet in the next one hello guys now in this particular video we are going to learn about the IP Command okay so this is similar to the ipconfig ifconfig command okay so in this particular video we are going to learn about this so let me open up the terminal and let me just increase the font size okay I hope it is visible to you and the command is just IP and you have to provide just one option that is a or a this one double TR okay so this will give you the IP addresses of for each interface so that is this is a local host and second one is my this one interface en p 0 S3 and my Mac address is there which is provided by the which what we say virtual box and this one is the IP address okay so uh now moving forward uh if you want to get the on the ipv4 address so what can you type okay so IP 5.4 and just awdr and here you go and now you have got the only ipv4 addresses not IPv6 but what if you want to get the ipv IPv6 address then what command you can do IB iPhone 6. address okay so here you can see this is the uh IPv6 it is the it means IP version 6 address okay so basically there are the two types of addresses that is a IP version 4 and version 6 and there are some differences between them uh like um uh differences in you can say on basis of bit size okay you can learn more about the differences between ipv4 and IPv6 and moving forward uh let me tell you about one more uh this option that is a IP address so Dev and interface if you want to get only information about some particular input interface so I will go with this enp 0s3 and here you can see the only result from this interface particular e and P0 S3 let me clear the screen so that it will be more visible to you let me again run the command okay here you can see the interface is this one and here is the MAC address and the IP address okay so in this way you can get the IP address and Mac address of your system using this IP Command okay if you want to learn more you can just do man IP and here we will get the multiple options as you can see here hyphen H for human readable for iPhone S for stats so I'll put more information if the cap option appears twice on the amount of information increases okay so let me try hyphen as IP hyphen is let's see what happens okay uh uh what should I do now object equal to address okay let me check like this yeah here you can see we are getting now various records like many more information okay this is rx bytes packet and a drop missed any packet which is Mr M cast so all these are showing here okay you get this option you can get more information again let's see some another option which we can use here like if you let's use hyphen r IP hyphen our address okay so here you can see the information about dissolver name 6 is virtualbox 64 scoping this is okay so that's all for today's video guys I hope you liked it and if you have any query then please ask us in the comment section okay so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you now in this particular video we are going to learn about the who is command okay so basically this is the command line utility of one of the GUI based tool that is a who is lookup okay so basically we use this particular command to find the information about a particular domain name as for example google.com or the IP address okay so this is the basically command which we will use and let's see what kind of information we can get about one particular domain name or particular IP address okay so first of all let me find the IP address of google.com okay so here I'm getting this one I will just copy it how I can do it just Ctrl shift and C I will just now hit Ctrl C to to stop this ping command okay now who is okay so now you will see this command is not found why not found because it's not installed in our system that so it's not found okay so just copy it okay paste it this is the APT install which this is a command to install any package you want okay let it install okay done done yeah okay I think now it's done it will take some time this way okay now done let me clear the screen let me again type who is okay yeah uh yeah I can do like I am able to learn to run this command okay now so here you can see there are many flags available to use this command that is a host Port I for query who is INR and follows its referral okay so now what we will do let's hit this one who is and first let's check for DNS only like for domain names okay so now here you can see multiple information about this domain google.com let me clear this screen and again let me show you the whole information about google.com so here you can see the domain name is google.com their ID is this who which server is this their URL is this like from where they have registered or what register URL and updated date you can see it's 9 9 2019 expiry date is 49.28 okay so name server is this one ns1.google.com minus two and so on and moving forward and here you can see the creation date all those things okay and admin organization who is the admin of this particular domain that is Google llc's the admin as we all know country us yeah we know it and sometimes we don't get this email because suppose you buy a domain name from godaddy.com okay so they take some some fees to you to keep your information safe okay so no one should access those information like your mail ID your password not password your phone number and all those things okay so in this way you can get the information about uh any particular domain name okay now let me again check with uh with the IP address whether I'm able to perform this not let me just copy this IP address again oh wait okay yeah 142.250 okay let me clear the screen who is and the particular IP address and we are done okay so here's the all the results so net range is this 142.250 dot not DOT not to this range okay so IP addresses can be between this Eid ad is this slash 15 so if you want to learn more about the idea I have actually uh write a blog on it you can search for it like subnetting infosec writeups if you will search then you will get okay then Google parent all this information you can get okay so basically where you will think about where uh you need this particular command what is the use of this basically if you go in the testing field or penetration testing or cyber security field and then there is a phase of information gathering so in this particular phase we use it okay so that's why I'm telling you okay so uh let me search for some more information like who is what are the things we can check here who is hyphen Q keyword description okay okay if you will use hyphen it will search for all the mirror databases b5p addresses with abuse contact okay show the email addresses okay uh let me try with hyphen B okay let's check what happens who is hyphen B google.com okay here you can see we are getting some kind of email address okay let me again uh like uh use this command and I will not use hyphen B option so so that we can uh get the difference okay so what was the command I had entered here who is hyphen B okay now I will just use who is google.com Okay so here you can see uh I think we are not getting any uh mail address here but here you can see admin email okay but here I am getting one address that is brjb someone's address it is okay so in this way uh you can use different options okay so that's all for today's video I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section we will surely help you and thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you thank you so much in this particular video we are going to learn about the nslookup command okay so basically this command is used to find uh like information about the DNS records Okay so previously in the host command we have find the DNS record so and already we have covered what is the domain name server like it is used to change the domain name to the IP address and vice versa and also various DNS records like cname record we have covered and txt record a record and for a record we have covered okay so many records we have covered till now and we will use this NS logo command to get information about these particular records okay so let's start with the first basic one start with google.com okay let me close this caps lock okay let's look up google.com okay done here you can see the address that is this is ipv4 address and this is IPv6 address okay so uh you can like what we say use this like this also you can use NS look of hyphen type equal to it means you are just defining the what type of record you want okay it may be a record okay let's search for area code iPhone type A and just provide the domain name and here you will get the address okay so in this you are getting this let me search for another domain name let's take some another domain name what should we take uh I'm not getting okay facebook.com okay so here you can see this is the particular IP address of facebook.com and this is for google.com so let me uh just copy this IP address and paste it in the browser whether we can access it or not let me just paste it here okay I think I'm not copied it okay just copy it and um we'll just open up the okay here I will paste it let's say whether it is accessible or not google.com with this iPad is okay so it is accessible and similarly we will try for our this one facebook.com I don't think it will be accessible let's still let's try okay it's showing not recommended I will accept a risk let's say what happens is I hope you have watched a scam okay so here you can see uh we are on this facebook.com page okay it means we can uh go on this particular page using IP address okay so moving forward uh if you want to get the record of like 4A record like a a a a and a okay I hope I count it till five okay so here you can see the version 6 like IPv6 address of facebook.com now let's try some another record for another domain uh let me check for a record for some other another another domain like I will now I will go for YouTube okay here you can see the iPad is of YouTube I we know it may be accessible or not accessible using IP address okay that particular domain so now moving forward to the different records so we will search for the uh txt record okay let's search for txt iPhone type equal to txt youtube.com Okay so here you can see this is the Google side verification some kind of text is stored okay and uh if I go with some different domain name like Facebook okay let's check okay these are the texts okay let's check for some another domain also I will just check for google.com okay here you can see different different uh like many texts are present there atlassian One Touch domain verification okay many things are there and now moving forward let's check for the MX record that is the mail exchange record okay it it is basically we use it to like sending the mail or receiving the mail from from any sender okay so let's use it I will just change this from type to MX and this is you can see the mail exchange which is smtp.google.com okay we have used this command like for like big giant so why not to use these command photos small uh websites like let's take some let me search it search it for uh I will open up Chrome here I think into this Firefox will take much time in this okay we are here just search for Linux commands okay so let me take Java T Point okay um yeah let me close this okay now I will use Java T point a record Java t point.com okay so here you can see this is the a record and here you can see true IP addresses are pointing to the same domain uh let me check I will just copy this IP address and I will put it in my browser let's check what happens whether it is accessible or not I don't know why it's not working off bidirectional copy paste is not here I think let me enable those settings yeah I think now it should work Ctrl FC oh yeah now it's working okay so here you can see uh direct ipx is not allowed for Java Point let me check the another IP address it will be it will throw same error I think let's see what happens okay same same thing like direct IP access is not allowed so I hope you got it how you can find the different records using an X lookup command so that's it for today's video and we'll meet in the next video so with some amazing commands so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one thank you particular video we are going to learn about the most interesting command that is a double gate command okay so basically we use this command to uh download files from the servers or from any website suppose in case if you want to download any kind of PNG or you want to download any kind of PDF or you can say uh also if you want to mirror the website it means you want to download the whole website their whole file that is htmlc is a JavaScript all those well if you want to download okay so in this case you can do all those operations using this single command that is a double get command okay so uh let's start now with the implementation part that is uh W get and the whatever the URL you want okay I'm just first I will give you the syntax so syntax is nothing but W gate options and whatever the URL uh you want to provide it can be uh URL of any file or anything else okay so now moving forward uh what are the protocols that wget command supports so it supports http https that is a high for text transfer protocol secure and FTP file transfer protocol so these are the some protocols which are used by the duplicate command so HTTP runs on Port 80 https runs on Port 443 and FTP on Port 21. okay now moving forward uh let me increase the font size first so that it should it should be visible to you guys okay now now what I will do I will try to search for image I have already searched I think okay so Linux PNG let me copy this image address or let me do here also I will choose this one image okay let's check let me check open image in new tribe okay um yeah this one is good copy image address and here the blue gate and the oh my god let's let's see what happens let's see just file name is too long okay so let's take some another image uh okay let me search for from here I will choose okay okay I think this one should be no not this one open image in new tab okay copy image address and now let's check so here right now I'm not providing any kind of options so it will just store my file in this current working directory but before I will just create a one directly W get tutorial I will create okay I will move into that particular directory and I will again enter the command that is W get and the this one link so here you can see it is downloading my file okay now I will do LS and here you can see my file has been downloaded okay now to uh see the image file uh there is a separate command that is a fee but it is you need to install first you can do like sudo apt install fee I know I don't know the pronunciation of this command but it can it could be something like that so as you can see phase already newest version so now what I will do I will just say and the file name what it was I think L something yeah so you can see file has been downloaded okay cool now you can easily download the files uh it can be used in some kind of automation things okay if you want but manually we download files from our web web browser but in some cases we could we can use duplicate command also so now moving forward uh we will uh see the uh like uh what like here you can see uh the name of the file is so big okay if you want to uh like name it some different names okay I will then for that we use capital O that is hyphen capital O option and then we will use the new name that I will provide this Linux PNG image okay and the URL let's check okay I will do LS and here you can see Linux PNG image I have not added dot PNG let me add it first okay dot PNG oh sorry sorry sorry sorry PNG done okay let me do LS and now I will use Fey Linux PNG not this one Linux image Linux what is the name it is Linux PNG image yeah okay so here you can see uh we have changed the name of the uh like file this so this like earlier it was a long string like the next pen doing Vector graphic pixel B all those things but now we can easily change the name of that particular file okay so moving forward uh you can use the different options like hyphen P option to uh like save the file in a particular directory in which you want so I will go just move back one directory and uh no let me PWD I will do and I will just copy the whole path here first okay if I'm not copy uh doesn't matter let's now I am in which directory I'm in this home I use directory okay now what I will do I will just like I want to CMI file in this particular directory okay but before that I will just remove those files uh edw get RM iPhone audio star okay it's not destroy it's basically as trick we say let me close this terminal now what you want to do you have to just to give the whole path of this particular like location so I will just provide this hyphen p and this one and we link so I will just copy this one link okay done it should be yes so now I will move back into this directory W get I'll do LS and here you can see the same image okay we have downloaded so using hyphen P option you can save your file into some another directory okay so now moving forward uh Suppose there is some conditions like if you are downloading multiple files or anything else and you have a limited bandwidth or limited internet connection or you can say limited net you have like these days we use 1.5 GB per days and all those things so in this case you want to limit your bandwidth or Internet like two like we we don't want to like w get to consume more amount of net okay so for this we use the uh hyphen hyphen limit hyphen rate option and we provide the what should be the minimum amount of the net used by this delegate command so for this what we will do get hyphen iPhone limit hyphen rate equal to one M1 I means one memory 1 MB and K means KB and all okay and the URL we will provide unless now or just uh use some different uh image oh not this one here this one I was learning what how I can see the image okay and this is not necessary okay move back move back uh let's download Spiderman Spiderman okay so this one is so like it's great image looking beautiful uh copy image address if I will do like it's on Splash image uh no I don't want this link let me open up this one open image a new tab okay uh if I will click on download free whether I will get some link or not if I will copy this one let's see what happens okay it's downloading now it means we have copied the correct link now what I will do I will just to paste the URL and we are done and also I will provide the iPhone option to change the file name iPhone capital O file name should be Spiderman dot PNG enter okay I'm getting some kind of error let me to Ctrl C LS something cat of look at log let's see what's going on okay saving spiderman.png okay let me again run the program uh you can use hyphen C option to uh what we can say to resume uh hyphen C I think it's uh ah small C let me check and again I will just open up some another terminal to check the W get lock file if I get the same error again CDW get URL LS and Trail hyphen f w get log okay and let me just again run this command okay redirecting output to W get hyphen log.1 okay let me just Ctrl C and W get one it is I think LS uh one okay connecting to onesplash.com so here you can see we can see the live uh whatever the background process is going on you we can see this like this using tail command okay so w get comma and W get log basically provides the log okay whatever it's going on okay so I don't think it is getting connected I'm getting some kind of error maybe it could be network error let me just close the connection I will use some different uh different image not from months plus okay Wikipedia is there let me open image in new tab I need a short link just okay just search for Linux only okay and this one let me check let me close all these sites okay let's move back I think it's taking so much time Open Image new tab no Linux PNG oh here it's still opening man how much time it will take uh let me pause the video uh okay so I was getting a network error at that time uh now it has been resolved so here you can see uh like the log file of this one W get DOT log dot one okay so you can see the file is already fully retrieved okay so uh now I will just check again so here you can see the image I think it's too large to display here okay that's why we are not uh able to see it so in this case if you want to limit your bandwidth you can use the limit hyphen hyphen uh hyphen iPhone limit hyphen rate equal to whatever the uh amount you want to give like uh it could be 1 MB 1 KB or anything it's all depends upon you and your internet connection similarly using hyphen C we just checked we can resume any uh like uh any download which is not complete or if like similarly I just got the network error so I can resume using iPhone C option okay now moving forward uh if you want to download some file in the background process okay so in that time we use the hyphen B option that is this one hyphen B option we will use and also the W get log file will be created similarly like this like this one W get log and W get log.1 okay similarly this file will be generated and we can see the whatever the process going on and all those things so now moving forward I will just download one PDF I will just search for us uh file type this is Linux Google docking we call it if you use this kind of searches file type I will just type uh um let's type linux.pdf I hope my connection internet should work okay again I'm getting a ride on to let me pause the video okay now I'm done I'll now finally it's working let me just search for uh file type I will just use let's just search similarly like this file type PDF uh colonizers let me write the file name also so that it could be easy so here you can see there is one PDF file introduction to Linux this one okay tldp.org this is some kind of I don't know which website is I will just copy this one move back to our terminal just LS remove everything whatever we have uh downloaded till now okay RM iPhone RF forcefully we removed everything clear the screen also W get hyphen B and the particular link or URL you can say so now in this case what will happen the log file will be created okay so I will just enter and what it's saying continuing in background PID is this output will be written to W get hyphen log okay LS I will just use tail hyphen f w kit and here you can see all done we have finally downloaded this one I think let me do LS and let me go into the file section file system open tutorial okay here you can see the file so in the background process what happens uh the file all the process whatever going on is getting stored in this W get hyphen log file okay I hope it is clear to you so here you can see all the process like oh this is like how much bits of data and all those things the IP address from where it is resolving it is connected on which Port that is 443 that is the https and saving which file that is into to linux.pdf file that's saving okay so I hope that is clear to you it should be clear to you okay so moving forward let me just close one this clear the screen and now we will move forward and we will uh if you want to download some multiple files suppose you both give your task and give you the links and he's saying you download one by one by one but uh you know the feature of this W get command you can download multiple files easily so how you can do it let's do cat let me I will just create one file that is cat uh books.txt okay and I will just hit the first link and let me go for second one okay this one it should work let's check Okay Internet bro yeah working finally okay second file um okay done we will just save only this one file control Ctrl D to save okay now done let me check the first text whether it is correct or not yeah clear and LS I will just remove all those files sorry my phone RF now there is nothing else so which option we use to download multiple files you use obligate hyphen I and the file name but where is file name let me oh I just deleted the file name also no problem let me create again Ctrl shift V and here also uh this one yeah Ctrl C okay just paste it here Ctrl D to save now we are done clear W get hyphen iBook Dot txt hyphen I okay resolving this one connecting to this particular website fetching news for beginners fetching and root intro Linux dot PDF file okay so in this case you can download multiple files you let me check with ls command and yeah done here you can see both the files has been downloaded finally okay so these are some of the features which we learned about till now okay so now in the next video we will see the the most interesting part of this wget command which will be covered in our next videos so till now we will stop here and thank you thank you for watching and if you have any questions please ask us in the comment section guys thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one hello is now in this particular video we are going to learn about the how we can mirror a particular website or download a particular website you can select that also so using W get command so already we have covered the first part of wget command and now in this particular video we will just mirror the website okay so what are the things we will be doing in this particular video so first of all we will meter the website and secondly we will just locally host the website using python okay and already the python installed in our one to PC okay this machine so these are the two things we will perform and let's start the implementation part so we will use this wget command and some of the options the common option is use hyphen am but it is not suitable to browse that downloaded website locally so additionally we use some other options that is hyphen K and hyphen P option also to browse those website locally in an easy way okay and it downloads the website in a particular format you can select that okay so I have already selected this particular website you can see this is a quite a good website and this is nothing but a free template from I've got this from this html.design slash demo slash bird uh bird IM okay so you can do this you can also download this template or also any other okay so I'll just copy the URL and I will just paste it here and but before that uh well wait a minute I'll just close it I will just create One Directory uh mirror website okay CD mirror website okay and now here I will use those particular this one command okay so now it will fetch all the HTML Pages CSS all the images it is fetching and here you can see contact dot HTML images bird lion dear dog anything whatever is the images and all those things it is fetching so it will take approx I think it should take three to four minutes of time as website is not quite uh long like it should not take much time okay so here you can see it has faced multiple files you can see multiple images of images directory and here you can see it is fetching left Arrow blue all those images it is fetching okay xmlrpc dot PHP okay it's present here in this particular website I think this is based on WordPress okay okay okay okay I can see this WP content plugin Json oh okay Let It Be I thought it is HTML page so that it will take approx two to three minutes of time but it is uh okay no problem uh let me search from another website till now which is an HTML not in WordPress I will just add one extension that is used basically used to find the water on which technology the website has been built manage extensions uh vaporizer okay caps lock is on vaporizer okay look up website extension I have to search extension for Chrome okay Let's uh check so it you can see it is downloading all those files and everything else add to Chrome ADD extension so basically this extension is used to uh check on what technology your website is built on it could be what process could be HTML CS it could be react angular okay okay and now let me check I will also search for only HTML templates free download okay uh Supercar okay foreign let me select this on tshirt design okay so I will just touch okay why this is not again it's still checking let me check the source code okay it's section ID script Ctrl U there WordPress is there or not now WordPress is another okay this is based on the HTML CSS okay okay installation is successful okay uh yeah here you can see okay I will just reload this page okay so here you can see we mu YouTube bootstrap is used in this particular website okay here it's still fetching it will take much time because it's based on WordPress that's why I canceled it okay uh cdhtml dot design okay here you can see multiple folders and all those things okay uh okay still let me try with uh just I will serve this webpage let's check what happens what are the files has been now uh downloaded and all those things I will just copy this link and open the this Firefox foreign let's wait okay so I'll just paste it and okay it's opening download free HTML template something is uh coming up here okay okay so it is downloaded the whole website I think okay okay I don't want the whole inside let me close this window first okay we will download the this tshirt design website I will just remove this whole okay clear LS now nothing extensions I don't want like this okay so it is just uh like we can see uh if we are passing one particular like another directory then it is downloading from the all those particular things like uh it if I will provide this link then it will start from this mobilerise.com extensions and all those things okay let's again try uh what was the command okay okay let's wait it's nothing so fast okay okay let's I will just pause the video and wait for the completion okay okay it has been finally uh downloaded everything now I will do LS cdmobirize.com LS and here you can see extensions it is there I will CD dot dot slash LS so mobilize.com uh one director has been created and that extensions is there so CD extensions and here all the files should be there like tool M5 is also One Directory we saw we are sure that okay tshirt design so here you can see the extensions tool M5 tshirt design and then the index.html file will be there okay I'll do LS and now I will do tshirt design LS and here you can see index.html assets so uh let me move back to the directories okay CD dot dot slash dot dot dot dot dot dot slash LS okay again no I think I'm in Mirror on mobile rise.com okay now I'll just start the python server HTTP server okay so just copy this link open up this Firefox okay the website we had chosen earlier like it was a very huge website based on the WordPress that's why it was taking much time so it is a simple website that's why Network completed in a very last time okay so in Mobi rise okay directory listing let's go in mobirize.com in extensions in tool M5 and tshirt design and here we go okay done so this is the website locally okay you can see all the same design same color everything is there okay now you can if you want to like edit this website you can easily do okay so there's also another method to mirror a website but it was related to WK that's why I told you about this particular feature I will go to about us uh yeah it's working I think okay now it is not linked I think about is not linked okay okay no problem so in this way you can mirror a particular website I hope you liked it and you can like match the things like everything is similar okay so in this way you can mirror a particular website if you want so I hope you liked it and that's all for today's video I have and we will meet in the next video with some another amazing command so guys if you have any queries so please ask in the comment sections and thank you for watching we'll meet in the next one thank you thank you so much particular video we are going to learn about the SSH command okay so basically this command we use to connect to the remote machines or if you are not aware of remote machine then let me tell you first what is the remote machine so basically this is the concept of cloud computing in which uh when you use a machine this is just like a similar machine but we access it remotely okay that will be the similar machine like your PC and the same operating system will be there okay and it will be Linux or it can be Windows OS okay so basically that particular instance or that particular machine is stored in the data center of different Cloud providers if you are using AWS then Amazon Amazon data center will be there if you are using Azure then Microsoft cloud data center will be there and in case of Google then Google data center will be there okay so basically what we are going to perform in this particular video so first of all I will create a virtual machine in Azure you can also do it because it's a free and using sandbox so you can like you get one hour excess of the Azure portal so you can go on this particular link or you can just search for create a VM using Azure portal then you will get this link and you will just need to login using your Microsoft account so I'll just activate sandbox it will take some time just wait for it okay but uh let me tell you first like SSH command so what port it uses so basically SSS command uses port number 22 okay so now this processes uh going on and in this particular this article you can learn about how you can create a virtual machine also if you are interested okay so now 91 92 yeah okay and you have to just to go there and click on this as your portal okay okay now here this here is the Azure portal you can easily uh create virtual machines in this just click on this virtual machine okay so I will just click on it and you have to just click on create as your virtual machine okay so here you can see the resource code you have to select just this learn and virtual machine name I will just use a Linux VM and this is the Ubuntu Server we are going to use in our case this is a image it means which operating system you are going to use so here you can see choose the base operating system or applicator applicable for the VM so we are all ready to selected there is Ubuntu server you can also select different OS like Windows and all for Windows we use RDP okay so now here you can see if you are going with this sh public key then it will create a DOT pem file but right now we are not going with it we are going uh it's a simple way that is a password so I will just provide a password that is ayush and I will provide a username okay okay matching now SSH Port is there you can enable HTTP also it's so all your choice okay now next and here you don't have to do any kind of changes no changes you have to do okay so you can directly just click on review plus create okay so basically the main purpose of this video is to so just show you the working of SSH cupboard okay so one uh this money scene is deployed then I can show you easily okay so here you can see validation pass it means you have done all the things correctly you have to just click on create here okay initializing deployment let's wait it will take approx so I think two to three minutes of time and basically this video will be the first part in our next part we will cover some different things in SSH like how we can share files and all those things okay deployment is in progress let's wait okay it's going on here you can see the all the steps uh whatever it is uh performing okay in like Linux IP VM NSG okay it will take approx two minute of time now yeah Linux VM is now it is getting created let's wait okay you can skip this part in the video like you can fast forward now it's done just one confirmation should come yeah your deployment is complete you have to just click on this go to resource okay yeah uh let's wait as end is not ready why not ready troubleshoot the issue okay I'm not getting why it's not ready let me just click on this VM extension issues no issue found okay okay now if you found uh let me just uh yeah IPA this is visible to me I hope now I can uh 2. so here you can see the IP address of this Linux VM machine and I know the my username and password so I will use this SSH command okay and SSH and the username is whatever I use at the rate and the IP which you have copied enter okay so here it is asking are you sure you want to continue yeah I'm absolutely damn sure click on yes okay so we have to just type the password I hope I have entered correct password okay done so here you can see I use Linux VM is the username and uh is the host name of that PC or Ubuntu machine this is ayush okay so you can say this is not my Ubuntu machine okay you can clear the screen if I'll do LS so here it is nothing okay so if I will just create one file uh let me create a cat test Dot txt uh leave I will not create one file let me just to install the one Apache server in the sudo apt get installed Apache 2. so it is basically a web server we use to host web applications so okay so just click hit enter okay oh it's not working I don't know why it's not working let's check I'll just close this terminal again I will connect uh I hope that connection has been lost okay SSH the username and the IP okay IPS not getting printed let me check what is the IP I have this one okay not I don't want HTTP something like that just remove all those things hit enter okay the password okay so now I am this machine I will just install Apache server Apache to hit enter yeah we want to continue yes click on yes now here you can see the Apache server is installing and this is not my Linux machine like you will think like this is my Ubuntu machine okay so Apache 2 is getting okay okay uh after uh creating the server you will see the default page of Apache okay we are done and I will just reload okay so automatically here you can see the Apache server uh default page is displaying okay so uh let me change this uh like I will just change the permission of one folder that is 7 7 and the folder is war www HTML basically this is the directory where your index.str file is stored I'll do sudo now okay and now let's move back into those directories I will just use CD dot dot slash unless again CD dot dot slash LS I will move into the war www.html okay now we'll do LS here you will see there is nothing I will just create index.html and I will okay permission denied I will use sudo okay again it's permission is denied okay unless iPhone l CH mode seven seven operation not permitted let's use sudo okay now I can edit this index.html file okay I will use this body and the H1 tag I will use this is tutorial base Stone SSH by ayush okay and just close this body tag Ctrl D to save and just reload this page okay so you're done here you can see this is tutorial based on SSH by iOS so I hope you uh got to learn about different things in this particular video like how you can create VMS in Azure Azure okay and also how you can install Apache server in your remote machine and the most important thing SSH command how you can connect so in our next video we will use different commands to we will see how we can upload files from our like this local machine to this machine but sorry but we will use uh like different server okay like tomorrow we will use ec2 server of Amazon okay because uh this machine will get uh like out of network in one hour okay not in even one hour it will take approx 35 minutes will be remaining okay 42 minutes okay thank you guys for watching this video and I hope you liked it and got to learn about new things so we will meet in the next video so bye bye and we'll meet you next one thank you for watching hello guys now in this particular video we're going to learn about the SCP command okay so basically this command is used to copy the files from one host to the another host that is uh in our previous video we had created the virtual machine and uh today we will work on that particular thing so basically in this video we will create one virtual machine and we will share the file or move file from this machine from this Ubuntu machine to that particular remote machine okay so we will do this with the SCP command so let's start the video on first of all we will need to create a virtual machine so on this particular URL you can go like learn microsoft.com and intro to Azure virtual machine then you here you will get the sandbox and you will get the access of one hour of azure portal so you don't need to pay any amount of money for creating virtual machine or anything okay so we will wait for some time uh it will just take hardly 10 seconds now okay let's wait 92 93 4 okay hundred okay so here you can see 59 minutes so it's basically we get access for one hour so now come down and just click on this Azure portal now here you will get the interface and maybe uh you will need to sign in with your Microsoft account and only then you will get the access okay it's taking some time let's wait okay here we go now here you will see the virtual machine you have to just click on it virtual machine and you will need to just go on Create and click on this as your virtual machine sometimes yeah here you have to just select your resource Group and virtual machine name I will just use this name Linux VM and the username and password so I will write the username as I use and the password I will write sorry okay again enter the password okay password match so here SSS 2022 Port is allowed so basically sap command runs on this particular Port by default okay so uh next you will do but here you don't have to change any kind of settings and all it will be by default it will be same okay we don't need to change anything okay here we go now what do you have to you have to just click on review press create it will take approx one minute of time uh okay till now I pause the video okay guys so here you can see the validation is passed so now we have to just click on this create button so it will just create a virtual machine and we will get the public IP address of that particular machine and we will use that particular IPS address to connect with this machine and whatever the username and password we have provided while creating this virtual machine we will uh use that one to connect to this particular remote host so let's wait for some time it will just hardly take uh two to three minutes of time okay so deployment is in progress let's wait okay so till now uh till then I just uh give you the overview of what is the sap command so already I have told you like this command is used to like copy the file from one host to remote host so here basically this machine is my uh physical host physical machine you can say and the Machine to which I will connect like this virtual machine that will be my remote host so I will use this command to share file from this machine to another machine so there are also some many of options we use for fast transfer for getting information while transferring we will use all those particular functions so here you can see the deployment is complete now we have to just click on go to Resource and we we will get the particular public IP address and here it will show yeah here is the public IP address first of all what I will do I will just uh try to connect to that particular machine using the credential which we had provided in Mobile creation I hope the terminally visible to you just to SSH and whatever the username I use and the IP address okay so you have used to write yes it will uh permission denied publicly okay I don't know let me just close the terminal and again I will open up SSH I use at the rate IP address okay password it's asking me for password hit enter okay now I hope I have entered correct address uh correct password okay okay so now here you can see the uh whatever the host name we had added like Linux VM and I usually the username okay so if I will do uh clear the screen and I will write who am I so here you can see the uh username is ayush and uh also you can see this hostname has been changed from Linux VM uh from I used to link swim I think let me again open up one terminal and here you can see I use virtualbox is there okay so this one is my remote machine I just add one command here remote machine and I will just provide the IP address okay so this is the like command view hash for writing the comment in this terminal now moving forward another use of the sap command comes here if we have a file suppose I have to just create one file let me create one file with the name of cactus.txt and I will just not test I will write some another cat remote file Dot txt and I will write something like this file is being sent from ayush physical machine Ctrl D to save now we have to use the SCP command so basically SCP what it stands for it basically stands for secure copy so you will send the file using uh Port like 2022 it basically by default it uses Port 2022 and also our this machine accepts only port number 22 no other port number it accepts if request is coming from coming for the some other port number uh other than 2022 then in that case it will not reply back to that particular host okay so now what we have to do uh I will just let me do LS so here you can see the remote file dot text is there and let me just clear the screen and SCP I will use and I will use hyphen capital c for the faster transfer and the file name that is the remote file Dot txt and the username I will also need to provide here ayush are you shared the rate and the Ctrl shift V and I will need to provide the location where we want to just what we say store that file so I will store this file at this particular location home ayush and 251 and I will just need to use this colon and sorry okay sorry sorry I just I will need to again write the command so here I have to just use slash omis okay so here what will happen basically uh this remote file dot txt will get transferred from this must into this machine like copy will be transferred so let me just hit enter and it will ask me to enter the password and I will just enter the password okay done so here you can see hundred percent so 0.2 kb per second was the speed and uh let me clear the screen and I will do LS so here you can see the remote file.txt has been uh like copied into this particular remote host okay uh like let me uh just send another file also let me create ios.txt okay Ctrl D to save again I will use the same command just change the file name file name to ayush now hit enter again maybe hope it will ask me to enter the password but let's see yeah I will need to enter the password that is Kumar Walmart 38098 hash hit enter and uh the file will get copied into that particular location okay it's taking time I don't know why okay now you are done so I will do again LS here so here you can see eyes dot txt has been copied now I will just try to read the content of this particular file Okay so I think the connection is slow that's why it's lagging okay sorry I've used wrong I have to read this okay okay let me just remove this okay yeah now just hit enter so basically it has overwritten with the like nothing we had written so by this command basically the text was overwritten no problem let me just read another file we have also transferred another file that is the remote file.txt we can read this okay so here you can see this file is being synchronized physical machine the same text which we had written in this particular physical machine okay so in this way we can transfer the files from one machine to another machine and also by default the CPU uses AES so 128 encryption method to encrypt files while while translate you can say but if you have to use some another method then you can use the iPhone C Small option also if you if you want to use some some different port number uh like if you will need to use then hyphen capital P option okay but by default this machine is accepting only the port number 2022 so if I will use some another port number then in that case it will not uh what we say it will not accept the request so if I will do hyphen Port 234 and I will just try to I will remove the files from this machine okay it's like running so I don't know maybe it's reason behind is slow connection it may be so I'll just remove the iso.txt file here okay sorry you should take the area so now file has been removed and now I have used the hyphen p234 and I will use hyphen Capital C option and just hit enter so in this in this case you will get like it will not accept the request like it uh it will not display anything nothing will happen okay to solve this issue we will need to use just a hyphen V option also hyphen small V that is just used for getting the default information okay hopefully we will get s not connecting to the spot number yeah because port number is not open that port number is not open in this machine that's why so if I will use just sport number 2022 and we have used the wrong command also hyphen P 2022 iPhone C Small hyphen V and now hit enter and here you got all the information so now you have to just enter the password but develop again ever we will see the information like connecting to this particular IP address on Port 2022 enter the password so done next okay sending command sending file modes I store TX 300 15 compressed outgoing raw data this compressed to this so while Transit Transit what happens whatever the amount of whatever size of your file will get compressed and then again it will whenever we it will reach to the remote machine it will uh like stored in the original form so again if I do LS here so you will get the ice.txt file okay so uh now let's do with the different port number let's see what happens actually total port number in network we use our act prox 65 535 for the total port numbers so I have just tailed it told about this for your information only so here you will see connecting to this particular IP and the port then you can see the port and after this nothing will happen because this machine is not accepting any port number other than Port 2022 so it will not happen anything it will go in the infinite Loop you can say and bus like we just need to hit Ctrl C so basically in this way you can use the sap command to share files from one machine to another machine remotely or or also you can say like the two remote machines are there then and only then you can use this particular command so that's all for today's video and I hope you liked it if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one thank you hello guys now in this particular video we are going to cover about the most important command that is the uptime command Okay so uh this is a very simple command and it will not take much time so let me introduce you first with what is this and so basically uptime is a command which is basically we use to find the how long the server is running okay so let's start with the implementation part so I will just hit up time oh sorry it's up time and here you can see it's 18 5151 that is 651 and up for since uh 34 Minute like from right now it's 6 51 as you can see it's 652 right now and now it's running till uh 34 Minute and number of users who are logged in that is only one user is logged in and this is the average load you can see okay so to get output in a very easy way to in understandable where this is there are multiple things here like current time up time okay users okay so but before that let me increase the font size I forgot to increase okay so I can use different options uh you can use hyphen is to see what are the options available so here you can see hyphen P it will show uptime in pretty format so let's use this and let's check whether output comes in pretty format or not so uptime hyphen P we are done okay so the server is running from uh it's running since 35 minutes okay uh let's use another option we will use hyphen s so it's uh the time at that time was 6 17 okay now it's 6 53 okay so and you can check the version of this uptime command using hyphen V okay this is something 3.3.17 okay so I hope you liked it guys this video so as this command you basically useful uh when you go in a corporate and you need to fetch some server uptime whether the servers is running or not okay so in that case you can use this basically command Okay so that's it for today's video and I will meet you in the next one thank you thank you for watching now in this video we are going to learn about the most interesting command that is a union command okay so basically this command is used to get the information about your machine okay so basically we will use this command to get the information about this Ubuntu machine so uh we will basically start with this and we will use some of the flags or you can say options with this uh Union command to get the host name to get the kernel whatever the kernel is being used in this particular machine what is the name of the kernel and also you will get multiple information like operating system Hardware platform information machine information everything you will get to know in this particular video so uh let's start with the implementation part so here you name if you provide without any option if you will execute this command you will just get the uh like name of the kernel name you will get okay so here you can see as we already know like in the installation video we have so like uh the Ubuntu is based on the Linux kernel so that's why it is showing the Linux so but before starting uh the like going deep into the video I want to just uh give you the overview of what is the Linux kernel okay so all units connect basically you can say is the core of the operating system okay if there is an operating system the current will be the core of that operating system babe why because it creates an interface you can say or creates a connection between your Hardware hardware and your software okay so basically uh kernel has all the control of your operating system if kernel fails then whole operating system will get failed you can say like that also so I hope that is a basic information is clear to you and we will see about kernel release what is Kernel release so uh let me tell you about the kernel release So currently this is nothing but whenever a new version is released of a kernel like if there is suppose a version is suppose 5.0.1 you can say like that then again new version is create release that is 5.0.2 so why this new version and why this new kernel release has been done because if there is some vulnerability or any bugs in the first kernel then that bug will get passed and then again new release will be done okay and you can release will be done okay so that is the concept basically current release so now we will see the uh kernel release so for this we basically use the hyphen R option so here you can see the now currently version and current release version of this machine is this 5.15.0 41 generic okay so in this way you can get the kernel release information now moving forward uh let me just show you this uh Linux like kernel name you can use a hyphen s option also to get the kernel name okay so uh like both will give you the same result like unim and unim hyphen s uh okay and now next moving forward uh if you want to get the host name of your computer like hostname is like that name which is used over the network you can say like that so if you you will do unim hyphen and then obviously you will get the hostname as in my case this is ayush virtualbox is the hostname and again next if you want to get information about your machine about your processor then you can use hyphen M for your machine U name hyphen M for your machine so like it is 64bit you can say you can see here it is and next if you want to get information about your processor then it's also easy you can get using iPhone P option so same information is being displayed here like it is the basically the architecture okay so now next moving forward uh if you want to get a hardware platform all those things you will get the same I think yeah Hardware platform is the same 64bit and to get the name of the operating system so obviously it is uh gnu Linux so links operating system it is Ubuntu so now again uh like there is also one uh super command you can say like super option that is hyphen a option which basically gives you all the result of these like you do you don't need to write this all to get if kernel release you you you don't need to uh anything you can use a simple command that is a u name hyphen a hit enter and here you will get the all the above information like Linux is the kernel name this is the host name this is the version and this is the uh what you can say I think this is uh your uh version name it maybe yeah it should be version name like hashtag Ubuntu SMP yeah it's a kernel version name it is and next is the date of creation or installation and next is your all the architecture processor architecture everything you can see and and at the last you can see the name of the operating system so I hope you liked it guys that was a very uh basic tutorial so that's all for today's video and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section so thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you thank you so much now in this video we are going to learn about another command uh that is the host name command okay so basically hostname command is we use to get the information about your what is the host name like this name and how you can change the name also with the help of host command you will get the uh IP address okay so we will start with the implementation part so let me increase the first font size so hope it is visible to you so now what we have to do we have to just write a hostname so it will basically give you the whatever the host name of your computer that is this one I use virtualbox okay so also you can uh like uh what we say change the host name and also you can get the IP address using different options if I will use hyphen I then it will give me this localhost IP address and but if you will use the capital i then in that case you will get the actual IP address and whatever the IP address the will be present in your system so in this case we have only one IP address and now moving forward uh the interesting part of this particular video is that you can change the host name also so how you can do it it totally there are basically two methods and you should be like uh run this command as a root okay like in my case this ayush user is like in the sudos file and we can easily change using this particular command so how you can do it uh you have to just use this particular sudo host name and host name and then what we have to do you have to just give the uh different name okay I will give this one actually this is my Instagram page username uh you can follow if you want so I think I enter wrong password let me erase now I use okay so a specified hostname is invaded because we have used underscore so underscores are not allowed I will just remove it underscores and hit enter and now I will again open up the one terminal new terminal and here you can see the host name has been changed from ayush virtualbox to this one exabyte okay so but now what I want I want to uh like keep my host name as it is so I will just copy this one and what I'll do I will just again uh run this command and use this and now in this case you will get it same at same as preview previous one okay so moving forward uh if you want to change this hostname in some kind of different method so how you can do it it's uh it is very unique thing you can say like you will you will use the one file I will create one file that is uh let's create with the hostname.txt and I will write the hostname as let me write let's write same thing as a white and Ctrl D to save and now what we have to do uh you have to just use this command that is the sudo host name and capital F and the file name which webkit that is hostname.txt and now again I will open the new terminal and here you can see the hostname has been changed from Ice virtualbox to excavate again so in this way you can change the host name also very easily now moving forward uh if you talk about the like fqdn that is a fully qualified domain name that is basically a domain name for a specific computer or a host on the internet you can select that so how you find it using this only one option that is hyphen f so this is the now my actual hostname so in this case you can get the fqdns also if you want to learn more about it you can just Google it what is what are fqdns so uh first now let me again change my hostname to the previous one this one yeah now it changed so yeah done so uh I hope you like this particular video and if you have any queries if you have any doubt then please ask us in the comment section so that's all for today's video we will stop here and I will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet you next one thank you guys bye now in this video we are going to learn about the password command okay so basically uh this command is basically we used to change the password of any user or if you want to add uh like password expiration days or anything you want to perform with the password any kind of operation like if you want to delete the password you want to make account passwordless then this command is used okay so we will basically start with the user creation like we will first of all add a user and then we will perform that operation on that particular user so I'm adding one user here only one or two names allowed okay I'm just giving the name as a password user here new password it asking me for I will give the new password okay no required these information yes okay clear now first of all what I will do I first login into that user password user and I will just enter the password and yeah here you can see I'm logged in into that particular user and now I will just exit because I want to use my account okay so let's start with the uh password command okay so now what we have to do you the command is basically used with the sudo why because only the root user or whatever the user who is present in the sudoers file that that can only change the password or the current user if you uh do like this sudo and only password it will what it will do it will change the password of your current account that is my account that is ayush and it will ask me for the new password okay but I don't want to uh change my password okay so uh for a minute let's change so as you can see password updated successfully but again I want to keep my old password so I will write that password okay password did successfully okay so now moving forward what you can do if you want to change the password of any other account that is a root account then also you can change that how you can do it that is sudo password that is pass WD not a full password so pass WD and then the user account name that is root so here you can change the password password updated successfully now what you can do you can just log in with that credentials using SEO that is switch user command and here you will need to just uh okay so now here you can just enter the password of the root user and you will get the access of the root account okay so with this you can change the password of any other user and also you can do many operations okay so now what we will do we will just uh change the password of this the user which we had created now so let me close this terminal and I will just copy this username because it's so long username I had taken no problem just to sudo password and the name of the user that is a password user an enter and a new password I will provide him just okay password updated successfully so now what I will do I will just open up the new terminal and I will log in with that new password I know the password is not visible because the this is the feature of the Linux like you cannot see the password like it's a great thing okay password user user user okay it's not coming okay now door okay yeah so here you can see you have we have logged in with this particular account so now let's do some certain operations like now what I will do I will just close up this terminal and I will just use some some options here it's like a hyphen D option now we will use so basically what happened this option deletes the password and make the account password list okay so if we do like this password hyphen D and the username that is a password user and here I have to use sudo so password expiry information changed okay now what I will do I will just again open up the new terminal and I will try to login and I will check whether it asks me for entering the password or not so here you can see it is not asking me to enter any password as you can see the password user uh like is logged in now if I will do here who am I here it will show me the password user so using hyphen D option you can just make any account passwordless so suppose uh if you want to create a guest account for the like any user who want to use the system and you will just give him thumbs give him that certain permissions like not you will not provide him the root permission and you can create his account passwordless the guest account could be password Let's uh let it be okay it will not affect your system or the administrator so in this way you can just create a passwordless account now moving forward uh let me try to just add the password let me check what happens if I do sudo password password user I hate my asking me to enter the new password I am again entering and now I will just exit here and again I will try to just switch into that account and now it should ask me to enter the password and here you can see it's asking me to enter the password now here you can see I have logged in as the password user okay so in this way you can add the password remove the password you can login into that account you using terminal using switch user command so many information you got till now okay now moving forward uh suppose if you want to like immediately change the password if you suppose if you will use hyphen e option let me clear the screen first I will use sudo password hyphen e option if you you will use hypheny option so what it option does it basically uh like prompt the user to change your password after login okay so let me show you just uh the implementation part I will just to use that username password user password expired changed and again I will exit and again I will try to just log in with this user sorry password user and I will just enter the password and it will ask me to you are required to change your password immediately administrator enforce like as I add main I just reinforce that particular user to change your password immediately okay you got it like Suppose there is a like organization in which the admin want to change the like admin wants like uh their users should change their password immediately okay so he can just add multiple users and then he will enforce them to change their password immediately okay so it will ask me to enter the current password and the new password I will write foreign characters so I have to enter the password which is longer than 8 characters okay the password face the dictionary check it doesn't contain enough character okay no problem so but uh you got the point I just didn't use the strong password that's why it's showing like this but in case of you if you will enter the combination of the 0 and 1 and be capital letters small letters characters then that will make the basically a strong password okay so now I'm moving forward I hope you got this point okay but still let it be I will just let me show you the implementation otherwise you will think like uh I didn't showed you the implementation but again let me just do the same thing and I will just log in that user I will enter the password and current password it is asking me current password I will just enter the password some long password I will enter okay so it's not showing any kind of air right now so sorry again I will need to do the same thing again there is some type mistake it should not done yeah okay finally if we change the password okay now if you do who am I and you can see like I am logged in as the password user okay so using iPhone option you can just force the particular user to change their password immediately after login okay so now moving forward uh if you want to add the like some number of days like uh minimum number of days required to change the password suppose you create a user and like uh Suppose there is a organization and there is a intern okay in turn comes in organization comes in organization to do internship so obviously you will provide him he will work for some kind of 90 days or 120 days or any number of days he will work so obviously you will create their account and you want to automatically expire their account after a certain period of time or or you want to change his password after a certain period of time okay there are many number of requirements you can do so to do these kind of things we use the minimum days okay mean days option so it means we cannot change the password before 100 days if you provide 100 in her you know option okay suppose the intern you don't want to change the password of intent till his journey suppose you're starting from 0 to uh 50 days if there is intention of 50 days and you don't want to change the uh and you don't want to like in turn to change his password in this case you can use easily uh hyphen Mendes option so let me use this option like it's a great thing I will use this password and a hyphen main days I will use Min days and the number of days I this time assuming the 50 and uh username password user I think it was the username yeah okay so there is a invite option it is showing me uh okay is there any okay there is no any option with hyphen M okay let me just try with hyphen iPhone Mendes maybe it should work let's see okay it's showing me permission deny and why it's so just clear the screen I have not used sudo here that so it's showing me permission denial so sudo and password expired information change and now what I will do I will just not exit I will just clear the screen and now I'm logged in as the password user and I will try to change my password so whether I'm able to change or not let's see because I have changed the permission of like I cannot change my password like uh till 50 days okay changing password for password user okay but now let me just close this session because this is uh like you can say old session I will create a new session and then I will try to change the password sudo yeah sorry Su password user and the password what it was yeah I forgot yeah let me just increase the font size I will just render this password and I will write Uh current password okay so here you can see you must wait longer to change your password okay so this is a like get a feature like you cannot change your password before 50 days okay similarly you can use the max days option it will just like suppose if you provide 100 days then after that what will happen your password will expire and you will need to obviously change that password and okay so what we will do we'll just Ctrl C okay it's not working control so I don't know why let me just type like this okay password unchanged and now what I will do I will just use Max Steel option so what it will do it will just uh like your password will get expired after this number of days so I will just leave it uh as 100 password expiry chain and you your password will expire after 100 days okay and also you can use another option that is one days option password hyphen iPhone one days so it will warn you to change your password before expiry okay so permission denied you know the reason because we have not used sudo here expiry changed okay so this is the way to manipulate with the uh password command okay and also one more thing is there like inactive is also one option which we can use to deactivate account suppose after 10 days of expiration uh the password expires and uh and still you don't change the password in that because your account will get deactivated okay and also one more option is there that is password hyphen capital S and sudo and I will just provide a username hope it will work yeah so here it will show you some of the information like you can see the date the today's date is 39.22 IP just shows the uh like uh account is locked or unlocked and here the date shows the creation of the password and the 50 is the minimum days and 100 is the maximum days as we got to know and 10 is the warning days you can see here okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section and please just give me the feedback in the comment section like how is the videos going on and are you getting or not and also you can ask me if you have any doubt on Instagram you can just you can just follow this page that is exabyte I know the name is little bit difficult uh after K you can just search as underscore 3xabyt 3 underscore okay you can ask me out here also so that's all for today guys and we'll meet you in the next one so thank you and we will meet you next one bye now in this video we are going to learn about the chh command okay so basically this is similar command uh just we learned about in previous View that is password command but in this we cannot change the password okay so we will start with the basic options and basic implementation of this command so that is Chas and using hyphen L you can get the information of a password of any account but before moving forward we will need to create a password sorry not password a user sudo not user ad I will use add user and I will name that user as a exabyte okay so I will just use like this x sub by height exabyte okay password nothing nothing nothing nothing why okay clear the screen now just chh and provide hyphen L as option and the username that is exabyte um okay permission denied okay no problem we will just use the sudo and we will get the permission is that easy yes okay so here you can see the last password change is that 7 like 30 September it means today's date and password expires never never nothing is added account expires the thing is added minimum number of days written password change is zero by default and by default maximum is 999 it's uh like it takes the date from 1970 I think that's why it's showing that number of days and warning warning is this like if your password get like uh uh ninth after before seven days of this completion you will get a warning okay so now let's move and I will use this we will use the maximum number of days like we will use hyphen M option to change the maximum number of days like this one so how we can do it cha is hyphen capital M I will just use 100 and the username that is uh this one and permission denied again because we have not used sudo let me use sudo and done and we will just delete the screen and just call that function and here on that command and here you can see the maximum number of days between password change is 100. now similarly you can just add the minimum number of days also what it will do like it will just you cannot change your password before that particular days whatever you specify in minimum days so you can do it it's simple just instead of capital M you will need to use iPhone M and you can use here the number of days that is 50. like till 50 days you cannot change your password again let me show the information and here you can see the 50 days like minimum number of days written password change is 50. moving forward if you will provide a minus one option then what will happen let's see with maximum amount of days it will remove that it will not check for that validation hyphen M and if I will provide 1 and I will do again check and here you can see minus one it will like it will not check for the maximum number of days if you will use minus one but I don't want to use minus one I will simply use the 100 to keep things simple okay moving forward if you will use 0 in a small M like in minimum number of days it means the user can change the password anytime but if you but if you use some kind of number here then user can can change that person after that number of days if I'll use 0 then user can change the password anytime if he wants okay that is the main use of zero and but I will use 50 here okay now moving forward uh if you want to add the expiry date in your password like your password should expired after that certain number of days okay so how you can do it if I will use like this sudo let me just yeah sudo hyphen capital E and I will use the format as year 2022 uh 10 and 0 1. in the username okay and tomorrow my password will get expired and here you can see account experience it's on October 1 2020 two okay but password last password change this and password will expire when in January 2023 yeah it's a little bit like a logical thing but yes you can understand because we have not I have just used this expiry date like normally okay so moving forward if you want to use the warning like uh Suppose there are 100 is after 100 if possible get expired but you want to only use it before seven days then in that case you can use hyphen W option hyphen W and suppose you want to warn the user before 10 days and here we got an error this is capital W set expiration warning days to one days okay sudo hyphen W10 yeah now done and here you can see number of days that is 10 as we have provided here okay so in this way you can change the expiry date minimum days of required to change the password password validation warning days you can do all the things with this particular command and also you can do same things with password command also but yeah if you don't want to change the password then you can use this command normally like you don't need to change the password again and again using password command okay so you have basically two commands to to this same thing that is password and this one what it was chhs okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it if you have any queries you can ask in the comment section and we will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you for watching now in this video we are going to learn about the basic command that is uh NL command okay so basically this is a very simple command okay but sometimes it's useful for Organics administrators in some cases okay so we will see the one use case and but before that we will create our own file let me give the name as names.txt I will write some names here ayush and Avinash and Harry and I will write Ron and again let's take some another name that is uh me okay I will use Ctrl D to save and now I'll just read this file names.txt but in this case you can see like there is no numbering here but sometimes we need to just get numbering like if you suppose this is a code uh if there is a code file and you need some numbering in that then we use this NL command to get the numbers so here you can see that one two three four five is listed here okay so suppose if I create an another file that is index dot X HTML right like body and I'll write this H1 hello world and I will just close the body Ctrl D to save and we'll just read the file cat index.html and you can see this we are able to read but now I want the line number of this file like of this code sometimes what happens uh like uh we get some kind of error in a particular line of code so in this case it is useful to like debug that error I'll use this NL and I will just provide the name of the file what was it index.html and here you can see there one two three line number okay so I hope you got the value what will be the what can be the use of this NL command but yeah it's very simple so that's all for today's video guys and we will meet you in the next video uh with some amazing commands so that's all for today's video and we'll meet you next one thank you thank you for watching we'll meet you in the next video thank you now in this video we are going to learn about the process in Linux operating system okay so basically in this video we are going to cover multiple things about the process uh what is the process what are the types of process what is the PID and basically we will surely learn about the basic concept of PS command okay we will just take an overview but in detail we will make a separate video about this on PS command okay so let's start with the process if you are a cc student and if you are an operating system student also then I hope you are aware of process but if not then I am here for you guys okay so let's start so what is the process so the basic and simple definition of process is execution of a program okay so now what many of you will ask me what is the program set so program is nothing but uh buddy like whatever you write in CPP code or a python code or a Java code that is a program and whenever you execute that program it becomes one of the process but uh if you take a real life example of a process here here you will see many apps are there if I will open Firefox that will become one of the process if I will open this Thunderbird that will become one of the persons if you will open files that will become one of the process okay so as for definition process nothing but execution of a program when you are executing any program then you are simply creating one process in your operating system okay now moving forward what is a PID so PID is nothing but uh you can say it like as a process ID it is created by the updated by machine from by Linux machine and which what it does which unique identify is the process Suppose there are multiple processes going on in this Reliance operating system so to identify each and every process there are a unique PID like if you are aware of the primary key of bpms so it's similar like that it uniquely identify each and every process okay or if you you will get a real life example of account numbers so more One account number cannot be associated with the two different people okay so similarly PID also works like it uniquely identifies the particular process and also uh in Linux there are basically the we learn about the two types of processes mainly that is uh one is the foreground okay and the second one is the background process so as a name suggest you might have guessed like what is the foreground about the background so forward means whatever the process which are run by the user so that is the foreground pressure if I will do here uh what I can do I can just do PWD this is one of the process if I will do who am I it is sorry who am I it is one of the process so whatever the user is entering the command or opening any kind of application or anything happening that is a pro example of the four dot process and now if you will talk about the background process then in this case uh what happens the operating system has multiple process which runs on the background as for example if you will take an example of the Microsoft Word Ms word so in this what happens whatever you write in uh like in what we say in a world then if any mistake happens spelling mistake then what happens in that case like it stays as the yeah this is your spelling mistake it like shows in red color so how how is it possible it's possible as the background process running on to check the spelling mistake you might have might happen Okay so this is the concept of the background process okay so in Linux we basically we can also create the vaginal browser using uh I think some kind of ampersand right we use Ampersand to use the background process so yeah as you can see the two one two five one zero PID has been created for this to create to do who am I as the background process to stop this you can hit just Ctrl Z or Ctrl C TRL C okay so if I will do FS command so it will display me the foreground process I think not FS I will need to like install this command FS or FB it is I am not remembering this like we will cover this all those command and all those in our next video FPS there may be no not it's not there FP is not there uh let me remember the what is the concept what are the command for the checking format process yeah so FG is the command to get the foreground process so here like no job is it is showing more job okay so if I were to B3 so be there is also there is no background process going on as per this operating system so also we will learn about this some of the command like in the left lecture that is the PS commentary bit which displays of the process State okay so right now it is displaying me the two like what we say two processors so relative has cleared the screen and surely we will learn in detail about what is the pidtty time same day now next lecture but let me just show you the example of the foreground process so if I will open up this Firefox right let me just split the screen and I will just do not Firefox I will open this uh let me open Firefox so right now currently it's showing me like this processor but for more you can check vs iPhone e okay so here you can see now Firefox is displaying here like 12630 if I will close okay and again I will check whether it is paying me or not I will just check with it PSI funny okay so here you can see there is no Firefox but when I will open up so Firefox process will get added and it will display me the PID of that Firefox so now again I will just clear the screen and I will again I will enter this PSI funny so here you can see like now different PID is being used for the Firefox now to stop this process you can use skill command also so kill command and the PID that is the one so that's all about uh yeah guys about the process I hope you liked it particular video and surely now next lecture we will get to learn about the foreground how to get foreground background and the PS command okay so we will learn all about these three commands and the process States in our next lecture so thank you guys for watching this particular video and I hope you liked it and if you have any query then you can ask us in the comment section thank you guys and we'll meet you in the next one thank you hello guys now in this particular video we are going to learn about the PS command okay so basically what is a PS command why we use it we will discuss each and everything in this particular video okay so what is the speeds uh but before that we just increase the font size now I hope it is visible so PS is nothing but uh process State what does it mean it basically means it just gives us the information out straight of any process okay it will get the PID of a number the name of the command who is the user using that particular process so we will get each and every information on the process but before starting and going into the deep inside of this topic you should know what is the process so process is nothing but the execution of a program when I open this Firefox it will become one of the process when I will hit this particular thing it will become one of the possible I know it is like anybody command but still if I will open any this music rhythm box then it will become one of the process of process and nothing but the execution of a program okay so now let's uh play with this PS command so when you will enter the PS it basically gives you the uh like status of this current cell what are the processes running in this particular uh cell like this is one of the cell if I will open another room window of terminal it will give me the other share okay so here you can see we are just getting this PS the command which entered just and this is the bash is one of the like you can say uh shell which acts like a parent uh process like some other person use this bash to execute some kind of uh they have to ask okay so now let's basically talk about the what are the these four types of like what is this like p i d t t y okay so let's start with the PID okay so what if a PID is nothing but the process ID what does it mean it basically gives us view the unique identification number of a process like uh let me tell you the example of suppose in a family member or each and everyone will have the different name okay not a like two person will have the same name in a group of like family of two two are not two five to six members okay similarly this PID is there like process ID it uniquely identifies each and every process in this operating system okay it just gives you the particular number of four day data so that is clear to you what is the process ID you know moving forward that if TTY is not equal to terminal type it gives you the information about what type of terminal has been used by the user let me just write uh terminal type and yeah if you are just watching this video so don't just keep watching uh make notes also so that will be helpful for you for your further use now this is a time in learning but the CPU utilization time by the process so here it is 0 because no any other process using this Bash shell or best command okay so this is CPU utilization moving forward the CMD is nothing but a command which is used by like what commands have been applied for this particular process okay so I hope it is clear to you like what is PID TTY times CMD okay now moving forward now you will be thinking about why there is only two processes to spend because it in PS files by default displays the current uh process in a credential okay so to get more information about the different processes like on a board time there are multiple processor runs like on voting of our system so let me just uh enter this PSI form a so here you can see there are the multiple processes you can see like what are the commands has been used like system d SCSI polka diet okay this one colored so there are many processors here you can see in this particular like the screen so here you can see the PS command is also there uh like the PID 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is that like if the PS command fetches the result from this particular directory if you do LS then here you will get the information about the particular thing okay so uh in this particular directory you can see many files are there like like it basically fetches the particular information from this particular directory okay now we'll leave it at just I move it on to the root directory now moving forward or suppose I just create one process okay let me just create one process but before that I want to tell you one command that is the one option that PS hyphen C discount basically uh option what basically it does it basically uh like gives you the information about the particular process which you want okay in case if you want to get information about the particular process uh then you can hit the name of that particular process here suppose I need information about the Firefox okay which is now it's not running so I can get this so now what I will do I will just first clear the screen and I will open up this particular Firefox so now what will happen when I will click on this firework one process is getting created and then the PID is given to that particular process and you will see that in this like uh now you know seconds okay so let's wait now you can see the this Firefox I'll get started now I will use this PS hyphen C and the name of the person that is the Firefox so here you can see it like from 10 seconds utilizing the CPU and the PID is given and a command is using like Firefox okay like you will say like you you are not used this phone but yeah let me show you if I will identify for the Firefox again the one Terminal 5 will start okay it's showing fail to load yeah but some modules fit but they're still here you can see one Firefox window has been a paid if I'll just close it okay so that uh this is the first one okay so in this way you can see the information about the particular process and if let me just enter one more command if I will hit hit cat and it is now in the weight estate like it is just what we can say asking for the user input whatever I will write and anything okay it is just waiting for the user input so I can use this command also I like I will write your cat and here you can see the PID is assigned to this particular process okay so now what I will do uh if I want to just kill any process I want to just what we can say discard any kind any processor now I can use the kill command and I will just give pass the parameter as this PID foreign and then here you will see like let's see what happens so here you can say terminated the cat is now terminated and similarly you can do for this what you can say for Firefox also but before that uh let me just use hyphen a option to again view the all the processes so when I will clear not okay I will clear this account just do psyphenate and here you can see uh what is the PID 6214 let me check whether it is visible or not yeah here you can see the six two six two one four Pi ideas okay what if I will kill this six to one for what will happen the Firefox window will get close okay so you can see now again I will use PSI funny so here you can see there is no six two one four and also no there is web content uh like what you can say web content command or any process is not displaying here as you can see in the previous command here while it is move packet you can see the web content process was also there so in this what had happened uh the 6214 PID was the parent process and under this process there are many other processes like here you can see the web extensions web content and all those things okay so in this way we can use this PS command to get the process of any particular uh application or any command okay now moving forward about another option that is the PS hyphen U okay so what is basically going to do what uh this one do so hyphenu option b is basically used to giving the like you want to get the information over to some particular user so if I use their iOS so I will get this information so these are the process which are being used by my commander not by my command sorry uh by me actually I use one of the user of this operating system if I have your root hyphen you root so as you can see the uh these are some processes which are being used by the dot user okay so also there were one more option that is the aux option PS command which is used for uh getting detailed information over the processes so PSI for aux displays the result in more or detailed format okay so here you can see the name of the user is like display like whatever user is using this particular command this particular process and the virtual memory utilization TTYL terminal type stats start when the process started so here you can see the 549 at 549 actually I had started by the system so it is displaying like on boot time this process has been started so you can see all the information but now here you can see here six one this process and now at 6 59 this command was done was used okay so in this way you can get the detailed information about uh your process okay also you can use a PS iPhone x to get the running processes so here you can see these are the running processors okay uh okay yeah this is the time command start okay so that's all for today's videos guide I hope you liked it and it was a very uh interesting thing like to get uh like uh what are the processes being used in your operating system if you learn more about this you will get to learn also more like when you will explore personally then obviously we get to learn more about this so that's all for this video and we'll meet you in the next one with another interesting command uh okay so maybe I will create video on top command after this so let's meet in the next one so thank you for watching bye now yesterday we are going to learn about the top command Okay so before starting this video uh first of all let me tell you about the what is the top card okay so if you have learned about the PS command like which gives us the process rates of uh like of our system similarly top command is also on the command which lies under the process management okay we can get the uh information about the different processes like what is the P ID of that particular process how much your memory is being used by that process okay we will see all the details and what are the users and what the users using that particular process so everything we are going to see about the in this particular video so we will start with the simple and basic command that is the top simple even you say top then it will show you the details about the other running different running processes by different users and all those things okay uh but before that let me just increase the size of my terminal I hope it is visible to you I'll just hit Top okay so here you can see uh the PID the what PID what does that mean I will tell you everything about the all these three what is these all things okay but before that I will need to save it like this the screen and I will just open command line also okay so here you can see what is the PID you just Define the process ID like if you don't know about PID let me tell you like like every device has a unique Mac address similarly PID is just like that like it is it uniquely identifies each processes whatever the process is created by the user then the our system assigns some PID to that particular process to uniquely identify that process simulate that is the process ID okay moving forward if you will see the user so user section just defines like who is the user using that particular process don't give attention on scaling mistakes okay that is not important here right now so what is PR pla just like private okay what is the priority of that command so the thing is that if though your what we say the number is lower so it should have the higher priority here you can see the zero so these processors have should have higher priority okay like you can see 20 minus 51 so it is you can see 2020 everything is there like so here you can write the lower the number higher the priority what does priority mean basically like this process like for if something happens to the more priority command or more priority process then the CPU users should like not CPU uses just think like example Suppose there are two processes A and B and uh B the priority of B is low but priority of a is high okay if some Interruption happens with hidden then a can use more CPU uses you can say like that okay so this is the defines the pr like what is the priority of that particular process of command and for the UK you will see here it is v i r t which really defines the virtual memory used by the task okay it is I think it's in KV it is in KB okay so that's why it's showing like bigger number okay so it is virtually you can suppose not virtually virtual memory used by the task okay moving forward what is this so this is uh what we can say I think it is the physical RAM yeah the command used like whatever the process is running like how much RAM this is particularly using like this particular process how much RAM it is using so it is also in the KB this data is in KB okay and moving forward if you will talk about the fhr so shr is nothing but a shared memory it also in KB okay and then the percentage CPU percentile memory time and or the other option you can see here uh where it is time plus command all those things like this is this uh this shows the uh which command uh like after entering which command this process is running okay so here you can see all those things okay if I will just yeah wait a minute what I will do first I will just stop this stop command and I will again run that top command and I will show you one okay so here you can see the top command is running okay like different processes coming here and there okay now what I will do uh but command is not visible let me just string create this one yeah now you can see the command is visible if I do Ctrl alt T and I will hit this Firefox okay so this command what it will do it will just create a new process okay and then again you can see here if I will hit enter in that particular terminal then Firehouse will come up there and some PID will be assigned to that so here you can see which command is this Firefox and the particular time you can see how much CPU uses per memory plus virtual memory okay and RAM also and who is the user I use is the user and the PID is four seven nine zero okay so in this way this particular popcorn Works which displays you the particular information about any particular process okay so now what we have to do uh if you want to just what you can see you can say like if you want to get information about the particular user like so let's suppose I want to get information about the IU shooter what process being used by that particular user so I can use those command also okay but before moving to that uh I will just tell you one thing like if you want to kill any process while using top command how you can do it you have to just in this particular terminal uh let me just increase this one okay uh where it is uh I think this one yeah this one Firefox was running Firefox pied is what 4790. now what we have to do let me just hit k so when you will enter K so here you can see PID to Signal default P ID is one six two two so here you can do it uh like enter the PID of the process which you want to kill or which you want to close so if I will search for Firefox I think it was four seven nine zero okay so let me just shape like this okay uh yeah here you can see four seven nine zero is some process let me just get this one the weight of it so four seven nine zero not able to see 479 here you can see fourth of manager is this one so I'll just hit K and I will write enter 4790 enter and here you can see the what happens when you kill the command uh it's not command can you kill the process then you need to give the particular signal so in this case I'll hit 15 so you can see like Firefox has been closed and also here you can see the terminated okay so while I entered the p uh 15 because like it's kind of a signal which we use with the kill command okay so we will talk about the kill command in some another particular video okay now moving forward what uh I was telling about to get information about the process used by some particular user so how you can see you like how you can do that what you have to do you have to just need to talk hyphen U and the name of the user ayush and now here you can see all the processes which are being used by this particular user oh I think multiple processes are being used okay so in this way you can get information about particular uh user if you want to like if you work in the corporate world and you get like other units administrator then in that case it will be very useful like to know like which user is using what kind of processes when something happens when you can see okay and also there are multiple things like uh you can if you will hit Z then the running process color will get converted into this so what we what red color and if you will do press uh like what you can say if you press C then you will get the path of particular command like go for which in which part that command is particular running so here you can see the genome cell is in user bin directory and many more things here it is okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and I will meet you in the next video thank you now in this video we're going to learn about the kill command Okay so already we have covered the PS command and the top command okay so in this video we're going to learn about how we can kill a particular process or you can see the how we can terminate a particular process sometimes what happens in our case like you open a Firefox or any application and it becomes unresponsive okay and at that time you cannot access that application and you cannot use that particular application so in that case you need to just you want to just terminate that process or close that application anyhow okay so for that purpose we can use the kill command and also you can normally you can also use that kill command okay to close any application or download that particular process so how you can do it so there is a separate command in our Linux system that is a kit okay so kill is the command you can use okay so there are the many signals provided by this particular command you can get two single using the kill hyphen L option so here it will list all the signals which you can use but mostly used signal is the 15 this one signal terminate and also you can use the signal kill signal kill okay so these are the signals which are used mostly by the kill command to kill particular process so to demonstrate you I will just open up the Firefox using this terminal I will hit fire Firefox and Firefox will start and I will just enter the PS and psyphen a to show all the process so here you will see the Firefox PID that is 8796 okay so I have got the PID of Firefox okay so with the help of PID I can terminate this particular process so PID is 8796 okay so but there is many uh ways to terminate particular process you can just terminate that process using the PID as well using third signal and the name of that like signal term Single kill and also without signal so I will just show you each and everything okay so you can just to kill that is PID is 8796 okay using PID or you can just do hyphen 50. okay that is 8796 so what it will do to just kill that particular process that you can see the terminated okay so also you can do how you can do it but now I will not open the uh Firefox I will just use CAD commands at home okay and I will just use PS cat to check the pad is 9405 okay so here I can use kill hyphen Sig signal and I will use Tom and I will just enter the PID number that is a 9405 and hit enter and you can see the that particular uh process terminated and also you can do like this also like a size Z without Sid you can also use this command so I will again use this one and I will first check the what is the process of CAD because process ID changes again and again that is 9417 this time and I will use 9417 and you can see the process terminated okay so in this way you can use the kill command okay now uh now let's use some another signal also so if I will use psyphen l not PS sorry kill iPhone help so I will use this one kill so let me check how it works I will use this so kill hyphen 9 and the process name that is the cat no not process name PID so 9431 kill hyphen 9 431 hit enter and here you can see the process is killed okay so in this way you can use the skill command to terminate any process or kill any process so if that process and responsive of that any application is on this point so in that case you can use this particular command okay so that's all for the today's video guys and I hope you liked and if you have any queries you can ask us in the comment section okay so I will meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching
