00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I've shown you how to
00:03 - download and install Visual Studio
00:06 - Express Edition for creating your cop
00:08 - projects and we have created our first
00:11 - project in cop and we were able to
00:15 - Output this message on the screen which
00:18 - is welcome to the tutorial now in this
00:21 - video I'm going to show you how to input
00:23 - and output values using cop for
00:28 - example the user want to input some
00:31 - values and on the basis of user input
00:33 - you want to show the output how can you
00:36 - do it I will show you in this video so
00:39 - let's start for example I will declare a
00:44 - variable
00:46 - string not this but string and I will
00:51 - name the string as name okay and right
00:57 - now I will name assign the the
01:02 - name as for
01:08 - example
01:10 - programming okay so this name which I
01:15 - have declared is called a variable and
01:17 - the string which is in front of the
01:20 - variable is called the data type and a
01:23 - variable is just a value holder or
01:26 - placeholder for this value okay
01:30 - and this data type I'm going to discuss
01:33 - this these data types in detail but for
01:37 - now
01:39 - just imagine that this is a variable
01:43 - name and this can only contain the
01:47 - string value string means these kind of
01:50 - word or this kind of sentences right now
01:55 - for example you want to show this
01:58 - variable name on the console how you can
02:02 - do
02:03 - is you can just
02:06 - write in the console right console.
02:09 - right just you can just output it by
02:12 - saying
02:14 - the name is and then give this plus sign
02:21 - and then not this equal to but this plus
02:25 - sign and then just copy this variable
02:27 - called name and place it here and what
02:30 - this plus sign is it's called a
02:33 - concatenation operator and what it does
02:36 - is it concatenate this string which is
02:40 - Al also a string and this string and it
02:44 - will show the output together so it will
02:47 - show ideally show the name is
02:50 - programming right let's run the program
02:54 - I will just click this green button here
02:57 - or I will just press control
03:01 - F5 and it's showing the name is
03:04 - programming so in order to show the
03:07 - value of variable what you need to do is
03:10 - you just need to give this plus sign and
03:15 - the name of the variable okay now for
03:19 - example you want to input the value of
03:22 - name or input name and then want you
03:26 - want to show the output this name right
03:30 - what you can do is once again I will go
03:32 - on the top and I can
03:35 - write console
03:39 - dot
03:41 - right and inside I will give a
03:45 - string and I will
03:48 - say
03:50 - please
03:54 - enter some name okay and then
04:00 - instead of assigning the
04:03 - name to this variable I will ask the
04:07 - user to give the name so I will just
04:09 - delete this and instead of this I will
04:14 - write
04:17 - console
04:19 - dot read
04:23 - line and what this console. readline
04:26 - does is it enables uh you to enter the
04:31 - value enter a string so it reads a line
04:35 - which you enter okay so what this
04:39 - ideally do is it will ask to enter the
04:42 - name and when you enter the name it will
04:45 - be shown here okay so let's run the
04:49 - program and it says please enter some
04:52 - names for example I write
04:56 - YouTube and I will press enter and it
05:00 - says the name is YouTube okay so it
05:05 - works like
05:06 - this now for example you want to enter
05:10 - the surname
05:12 - also or you want to
05:16 - enter two
05:18 - names what you can do is you can just
05:22 - copy
05:25 - this and paste it
05:28 - here and this name I will call this name
05:32 - name one and I will call this name two
05:36 - okay and I will say please enter name
05:43 - one and here I will say please enter
05:46 - name two okay so for example I want to
05:50 - enter two names what can I do here I can
05:55 - just
05:57 - print the four first name is so I can
06:02 - write first name
06:06 - is
06:08 - and you can just give this plus sign
06:11 - once again here and again you can write
06:18 - and second name is and
06:23 - just give this this will contain the
06:26 - first name and this will should contain
06:29 - the second name just using this plus
06:33 - operator okay so this will also print
06:39 - out let's see what it prints out so I
06:41 - will run the program it says please
06:43 - enter the first name so I will
06:50 - write YouTube 1 and press enter and the
06:56 - second name I will
06:57 - write YouTube
07:00 - 2 and when I press enter here you see it
07:04 - says first name is YouTube 1 and the
07:06 - second name is YouTube to okay so the
07:10 - concatenation works like this now there
07:13 - is other way you can uh print these
07:18 - values and this other way is called you
07:22 - by using
07:23 - placeholders so instead of uh doing like
07:27 - this what you can write
07:33 - is you can
07:36 - write the names are or
07:42 - names entered R and then you give a
07:48 - curly braces and inside you give zero
07:53 - and once again give and and once again
07:56 - give curly braces and give
08:00 - one and in here give a comma and not
08:05 - this one but comma and give the first
08:09 - name and once again the comma and give
08:13 - the second
08:15 - name okay so
08:17 - what this code is it's a placeholder
08:21 - it's called a
08:22 - placeholder and this placeholder will
08:26 - show the value of the first first value
08:30 - you will pass after comma and this
08:33 - placeholder will show the second value
08:37 - after this comma so second value is name
08:40 - two right and it starts it starts from
08:43 - zero so 0 1 and if we have the third
08:46 - value we will write name three for
08:50 - example and in here we will write once
08:53 - again of curly braces and two okay so it
08:58 - it will show show the third value also
09:01 - but right now we don't have any third
09:03 - value so just remember this is called
09:06 - called the place holder and
09:09 - whatever is the zeroth value which is
09:12 - name one after comma it will just
09:17 - replace this by this name and it will
09:20 - just replace this second value by this
09:23 - okay and I will run the program once
09:27 - again and I will say this
09:32 - time 1 2 3 4 5 for example and second
09:36 - name
09:38 - is Max okay and I will press enter and
09:43 - it says the names entered are 1 2 3 4 5
09:47 - and Max
09:50 - right so in this way you
09:52 - can use
09:56 - this console right to Output put the
09:59 - values and console read line to input
10:02 - the values now what we have done till
10:06 - now is for the string but suppose you
10:09 - want to show the integers for example
10:13 - once again I will just delete this or I
10:17 - will keep it here I will declare a
10:19 - variable integer so I will declare int
10:24 - X and I will say is equal
10:28 - to
10:29 - is equal
10:34 - to console dot read
10:39 - line so instead of using string you want
10:43 - to use the integer
10:48 - and I have I have written this in front
10:52 - of this X and it's showing this squiggly
10:56 - line here and it's showing that this is
10:58 - not possible because read line only
11:02 - takes the string values and not the
11:05 - integers and this variable we have
11:07 - declared is an integer right this data
11:10 - type of this variable is an integer and
11:13 - this is not
11:15 - possible so what we can do is we need to
11:20 - pass whatever string we have enter into
11:23 - the integer and then show it or or then
11:28 - place it into the X so how we can do it
11:32 - you can just write int
11:37 - dot
11:38 - pars and in the bracket you enclose this
11:43 - console. read line and what this line
11:46 - will do is whatever string or whatever
11:49 - line you will
11:51 - enter it will just convert this string
11:55 - into the integer and then place it into
11:58 - the X right and for this I will do the
12:03 - same
12:05 - here so for example I will say please
12:12 - enter number one and please enter number
12:15 - two okay and you want to show the
12:18 - addition of these two numbers this
12:20 - should be y for example okay and for
12:24 - example you want to show the addition of
12:27 - these two numbers
12:29 - so what you can do here
12:32 - is you can declare a third variable
12:36 - in
12:38 - int Z = to
12:45 - X+ y okay and what this does is whatever
12:50 - you write the value of x and whatever
12:53 - you enter the value of y it will add
12:56 - those two values and place it into this
12:59 - Zed okay and for example you want to
13:02 - show the addition so that you can
13:06 - write
13:08 - the
13:09 - sum
13:11 - of value zero which is X so just copy X
13:16 - here and value Y which is y so copy and
13:21 - paste Y and then write is and we will we
13:25 - will assign or we will use third
13:28 - placeholder for Zed so just write curly
13:32 - braces 2 and then here
13:36 - write z okay now when we run the program
13:41 - it will ask us to enter the first value
13:44 - let's give space here because it's a
13:47 - little bit
13:48 - confusing and here also okay run the
13:52 - program once again and I will enter
13:55 - first number for example 355 enter I
13:59 - will enter the second
14:00 - number
14:02 - 675 for example and I press enter and it
14:06 - will give the output the sum of 365 and
14:11 - 675 is
14:13 - 1030 which is correct right so in this
14:17 - way you can output the values by user
14:20 - inputs okay this should be two okay so I
14:26 - hope you have understood the concept of
14:28 - input and outputting the values on
14:31 - screen uh and please keep watching this
14:34 - video I'm going to cover lots of things
14:36 - so please stay tuned and please wrate
14:38 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I've shown you how to download and install Visual Studio Express Edition for creating your cop projects and we have created our first project in cop and we were able to Output this message on the screen which is welcome to the tutorial now in this video I'm going to show you how to input and output values using cop for example the user want to input some values and on the basis of user input you want to show the output how can you do it I will show you in this video so let's start for example I will declare a variable string not this but string and I will name the string as name okay and right now I will name assign the the name as for example programming okay so this name which I have declared is called a variable and the string which is in front of the variable is called the data type and a variable is just a value holder or placeholder for this value okay and this data type I'm going to discuss this these data types in detail but for now just imagine that this is a variable name and this can only contain the string value string means these kind of word or this kind of sentences right now for example you want to show this variable name on the console how you can do is you can just write in the console right console. right just you can just output it by saying the name is and then give this plus sign and then not this equal to but this plus sign and then just copy this variable called name and place it here and what this plus sign is it's called a concatenation operator and what it does is it concatenate this string which is Al also a string and this string and it will show the output together so it will show ideally show the name is programming right let's run the program I will just click this green button here or I will just press control F5 and it's showing the name is programming so in order to show the value of variable what you need to do is you just need to give this plus sign and the name of the variable okay now for example you want to input the value of name or input name and then want you want to show the output this name right what you can do is once again I will go on the top and I can write console dot right and inside I will give a string and I will say please enter some name okay and then instead of assigning the name to this variable I will ask the user to give the name so I will just delete this and instead of this I will write console dot read line and what this console. readline does is it enables uh you to enter the value enter a string so it reads a line which you enter okay so what this ideally do is it will ask to enter the name and when you enter the name it will be shown here okay so let's run the program and it says please enter some names for example I write YouTube and I will press enter and it says the name is YouTube okay so it works like this now for example you want to enter the surname also or you want to enter two names what you can do is you can just copy this and paste it here and this name I will call this name name one and I will call this name two okay and I will say please enter name one and here I will say please enter name two okay so for example I want to enter two names what can I do here I can just print the four first name is so I can write first name is and you can just give this plus sign once again here and again you can write and second name is and just give this this will contain the first name and this will should contain the second name just using this plus operator okay so this will also print out let's see what it prints out so I will run the program it says please enter the first name so I will write YouTube 1 and press enter and the second name I will write YouTube 2 and when I press enter here you see it says first name is YouTube 1 and the second name is YouTube to okay so the concatenation works like this now there is other way you can uh print these values and this other way is called you by using placeholders so instead of uh doing like this what you can write is you can write the names are or names entered R and then you give a curly braces and inside you give zero and once again give and and once again give curly braces and give one and in here give a comma and not this one but comma and give the first name and once again the comma and give the second name okay so what this code is it's a placeholder it's called a placeholder and this placeholder will show the value of the first first value you will pass after comma and this placeholder will show the second value after this comma so second value is name two right and it starts it starts from zero so 0 1 and if we have the third value we will write name three for example and in here we will write once again of curly braces and two okay so it it will show show the third value also but right now we don't have any third value so just remember this is called called the place holder and whatever is the zeroth value which is name one after comma it will just replace this by this name and it will just replace this second value by this okay and I will run the program once again and I will say this time 1 2 3 4 5 for example and second name is Max okay and I will press enter and it says the names entered are 1 2 3 4 5 and Max right so in this way you can use this console right to Output put the values and console read line to input the values now what we have done till now is for the string but suppose you want to show the integers for example once again I will just delete this or I will keep it here I will declare a variable integer so I will declare int X and I will say is equal to is equal to console dot read line so instead of using string you want to use the integer and I have I have written this in front of this X and it's showing this squiggly line here and it's showing that this is not possible because read line only takes the string values and not the integers and this variable we have declared is an integer right this data type of this variable is an integer and this is not possible so what we can do is we need to pass whatever string we have enter into the integer and then show it or or then place it into the X so how we can do it you can just write int dot pars and in the bracket you enclose this console. read line and what this line will do is whatever string or whatever line you will enter it will just convert this string into the integer and then place it into the X right and for this I will do the same here so for example I will say please enter number one and please enter number two okay and you want to show the addition of these two numbers this should be y for example okay and for example you want to show the addition of these two numbers so what you can do here is you can declare a third variable in int Z = to X+ y okay and what this does is whatever you write the value of x and whatever you enter the value of y it will add those two values and place it into this Zed okay and for example you want to show the addition so that you can write the sum of value zero which is X so just copy X here and value Y which is y so copy and paste Y and then write is and we will we will assign or we will use third placeholder for Zed so just write curly braces 2 and then here write z okay now when we run the program it will ask us to enter the first value let's give space here because it's a little bit confusing and here also okay run the program once again and I will enter first number for example 355 enter I will enter the second number 675 for example and I press enter and it will give the output the sum of 365 and 675 is 1030 which is correct right so in this way you can output the values by user inputs okay this should be two okay so I hope you have understood the concept of input and outputting the values on screen uh and please keep watching this video I'm going to cover lots of things so please stay tuned and please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
