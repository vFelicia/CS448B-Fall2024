00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video and the next few
00:07 - videos I will be teaching you how to use
00:09 - action bars in Android so first of all
00:14 - what is an action bar in our Android app
00:17 - so whenever we open our Android app this
00:22 - black strip you can see here where your
00:24 - app title is there or you can see some
00:28 - overflow menu here it's called an action
00:31 - bar and two action bar you can add your
00:35 - app icon your app title and some of the
00:39 - settings for example you can add about
00:43 - your app some information or some
00:46 - settings or some search icon and some
00:50 - sub menu if you want so let's see how we
00:53 - can use this action bar and how we can
00:56 - use our customer icons here in the sub
01:02 - menu so let's get started first of all
01:05 - open your Android studio and I'm going
01:07 - to create a new Android application and
01:10 - I'm going to name it as action demo for
01:15 - example and then I'm going to click Next
01:17 - and one thing you need to notice here is
01:21 - this action bar is available after
01:24 - Android 3.0 or after API 11 including
01:31 - this API 11 and Android 3.0 so if you
01:36 - want to see action bar on your Android
01:39 - app you need to choose this API level
01:44 - which is API level 11 or above before
01:47 - that action bar was not available so for
01:51 - example I choose this API level 12 or
01:54 - Android 3.1 and then I'm going to click
02:00 - Next and I'm going to create a blank
02:04 - activity and click finish so my project
02:09 - is created now and this is a bank
02:11 - project and when I run the
02:13 - so app like this my blank app runs and I
02:17 - can see the default action bar is
02:20 - provided by Android to us which has the
02:25 - title so action demo and the submenu you
02:30 - can say here and this three dots here
02:34 - are called overflow menu and overflow
02:37 - means that something is hidden behind it
02:42 - or you can you know show multiple icons
02:47 - or sub menus here and you can even add
02:51 - an icon to your action bar which I'm
02:56 - going to show you how you can add your
02:58 - app I can here and how to add your
03:01 - customized overflow items okay so let's
03:06 - get started first of all let's see how
03:10 - and where this action bar menu resides
03:15 - in our project so first of all I'm going
03:17 - to remove this hello world from here and
03:21 - then I'm going to go to my android
03:24 - manifest XML file and in here in the
03:28 - Android team you will be able to see
03:30 - style slash app theme so in style dot
03:35 - XML file this team your app theme is
03:38 - there so I'm going to go to this values
03:41 - folder and inside this I will be able to
03:43 - see the Styles dot XML file and in here
03:46 - I can see the theme of my action bar so
03:51 - I can see that my style name is app team
03:56 - and parent is theme dot app compat dot
04:01 - light dot dark action bar so this action
04:04 - bar is already present in my app right
04:09 - now what are the methods which are
04:13 - responsible to open this action bar so
04:17 - when you go to your main activity dot
04:20 - Java file you can see these two methods
04:24 - one is called on create Oh
04:26 - menu and second is on options items
04:32 - selected okay
04:34 - so these two methods are responsible for
04:39 - showing and some actions for this action
04:43 - bar okay and when you go to your menu
04:48 - folder here so go to menu and in menu
04:51 - underscore main dot XML file you will be
04:55 - able to see here you can see this action
04:59 - settings so you have your menu and
05:02 - inside your menu you have some menu
05:05 - items and first menu item here is called
05:09 - settings ok so you can see here we have
05:15 - the settings menu here ok and it says
05:20 - that show as action never this we will
05:23 - discuss in a while but now let's do it
05:29 - by ourself so once again I'm going to go
05:32 - to my mainactivity.java and in here this
05:35 - on create option menu is responsible for
05:39 - my menu mean so it's going to inflate my
05:44 - menu mean whenever this method is called
05:47 - and this is responsible for my items in
05:52 - the menu so you can see there is a menu
05:55 - called settings which is called by this
05:59 - function or method so let's delete these
06:02 - two methods and we are going to create
06:05 - them from scratch so we will be able to
06:09 - understand how they work in better way
06:12 - okay
06:13 - so let's delete them and first of all
06:17 - for example I want to add an icon to my
06:21 - action bar how can I do it so let's see
06:24 - how we can add an icon to our action bar
06:28 - so go inside your oncreate method and
06:32 - here we will declare a action bar
06:37 - objects so action bar a B
06:40 - is equal to get action bars so just
06:44 - right get action bar and then from this
06:48 - action bar we can select a logo for our
06:52 - application so just write a b dot set
06:57 - logo and if you know in our drawable
07:03 - folder there are already some default
07:06 - icons available for example this IC
07:09 - launcher so i'm going to use this
07:11 - default icon but you can use your own
07:14 - app i can just you need to paste your
07:17 - icon inside this drawable folder and
07:20 - it's going to work okay and that we will
07:24 - also cover in the later video or in the
07:26 - next video itself how we can add some
07:29 - icons here but right now i'm going to
07:32 - add a default icon so just call our dot
07:38 - drawable dot IC launcher okay so this is
07:43 - the icon now i can see this set logo is
07:47 - giving me this error here and it says
07:50 - call require api level 14 okay and we
07:55 - are using I think APA level 12 so we
07:59 - need to add some supporting library to
08:02 - it so how we can do it we can instead of
08:05 - using get action bar we can use get
08:09 - supported action bar so get supported
08:13 - action bar and it's going to give us
08:16 - this red bulb here and when you click on
08:19 - this bulb it's going to say that change
08:22 - variable a B type to Android support dot
08:26 - v7 dot AB dot action bar so we will do
08:29 - this it's going to add this supporting
08:31 - library okay and then we can set our
08:36 - display logo enabled so a B dot set
08:41 - display logo enabled this one and we are
08:46 - going to set it as true and one more
08:49 - thing we need is a B dot
08:54 - display show home enable okay so set
08:57 - display show home enabled is equal to
09:00 - true okay so this method is going to
09:05 - enable your logo and this method is
09:10 - going to enable your home okay
09:14 - so now we are going to run our program
09:17 - or app and now our app is running and we
09:21 - can see here this icon is shown here so
09:25 - this is the default icon which we have
09:27 - used and now our app has this icon here
09:32 - okay and you will also notice that here
09:35 - this overflow menu is gone because we
09:40 - have deleted those two method below
09:43 - which are responsible for this method
09:47 - okay or this item here so we are going
09:51 - to add this manually in the next video
09:54 - and we will see how we can add menu
09:57 - items to our action bars in the next
10:01 - video so stay tuned and please rate
10:03 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
