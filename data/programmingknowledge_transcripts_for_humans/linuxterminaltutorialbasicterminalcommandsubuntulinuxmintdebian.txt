00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - teach you some of the basic terminal
00:05 - command in Linux terminal I'm using
00:09 - Ubuntu for this demonstration but this
00:12 - will work fine on any Linux uh operating
00:16 - system which has terminal commands so
00:20 - let's get started just open your
00:22 - terminal and the First Command we are
00:25 - going to see is
00:27 - PWD PWD stands for present working
00:31 - directory and as the name suggest it
00:36 - just gives you the present working
00:39 - directory in which we are in so by
00:42 - default uh we are in home folder or on
00:46 - open 2 okay now for
00:50 - example you want to list out all the
00:54 - directory in your home folder okay so
00:57 - what you can do is you can give the
01:00 - command LS for list listing out whatever
01:05 - files or directory are there in this
01:08 - obuntu home folder home obuntu folder
01:11 - okay so just give LS and press enter and
01:15 - it gives all the folder and document in
01:20 - this openo folder right now if you want
01:24 - to see the hidden files this only shows
01:28 - the non-hidden f files uh by this
01:32 - command so if you want to show the
01:35 - hidden file also what you can do is you
01:38 - can give the command Lis minus a a stand
01:43 - for all list all and you can see it will
01:47 - just print out all the files and which
01:52 - are hidden or not hidden all the files
01:55 - in the terminal now our terminal looks
01:59 - like like full right so to clear your
02:03 - terminal you can just give the
02:05 - command clear then it will clear your
02:10 - terminal okay so what is the command for
02:14 - clearing just write clear on the
02:17 - terminal now once again let's list out
02:21 - the all the directories and for example
02:25 - so
02:27 - uh in the current folder which we in in
02:30 - which we are in it has desktop folder
02:33 - documents folder and music public videos
02:37 - okay so for example you want to go
02:40 - inside
02:41 - your downloads folder or let's go to the
02:45 - documents folder first okay so what you
02:49 - uh need to do is you need to give this
02:52 - command CD so CD stand for current
02:56 - working directory and then give the name
02:59 - name of the folder in which you want to
03:02 - go okay so first you need to list out
03:05 - this uh this folders and if this folder
03:09 - is present there then just write CD
03:17 - then document and
03:20 - slash so whenever you write do here and
03:24 - press tab also it will autocomplete your
03:28 - search so for example you write do and
03:31 - press this tab button it will complete
03:34 - your search like this and press enter
03:37 - and now you are in documents folder
03:40 - let's see what is there in documents
03:43 - there is nothing in the documents so
03:46 - let's make a directory in your document
03:49 - folder so for making the directory in
03:52 - the folder you need to give this command
03:56 - mkd for make directory and then you need
04:00 - to give the name of the directory so
04:03 - just I will give the name of the
04:06 - directory as
04:07 - test and press enter and now I will list
04:10 - out all the directories in documents and
04:13 - I can see there is a new directory
04:15 - created called test now for example I
04:18 - want to go into this directory once
04:20 - again I will write
04:22 - CD and I will
04:25 - write test for example look here I'm
04:28 - giving this
04:30 - in capital letter which doesn't matches
04:33 - this test folder which is T and small
04:37 - EST I'm giving all capital and what
04:40 - happens it'll give you error because
04:43 - Linux is case sensitive whenever you
04:47 - want to go into some folder in Linux you
04:50 - need to give the exact spelling of the
04:53 - folder not in capital letter or not in
04:57 - uh small letter exact spelling so once
05:01 - again when I give
05:03 - CD test and we are in this directory now
05:10 - for example I want to go back one
05:14 - document up so right now I'm in test
05:18 - directory you see here so in here this
05:21 - shows that in which directory you are in
05:25 - the till this sign if you can see here
05:28 - this is a small sign it indicates that
05:31 - we are in our home folder and in home
05:34 - folder we are in documents and in
05:37 - document we are in test folder now once
05:42 - again I want to go to the last folder
05:44 - that is document right now we are in
05:46 - test folder right so for going one
05:49 - folder up you need to give this command
05:52 - CD space then dot dot okay so space is
05:58 - not like this
06:00 - CD dot dot this is not the command
06:02 - command is CD space dot dot and then you
06:06 - will go one folder up you see earlier it
06:10 - was we are we were in test folder and
06:13 - right now we are in document folder now
06:16 - for example let's list out once again we
06:19 - have test folder inside document and we
06:22 - want to uh delete this directory once uh
06:25 - this test directory which we have
06:27 - created so for remove moving this
06:30 - directory you need to give this command
06:33 - rmdir and give the name of the directory
06:36 - which is test and press enter and this
06:41 - command will remove the directory in
06:45 - your document folder so this command
06:47 - will remove the test directory I would
06:49 - say in your folder and now when you LS
06:52 - Or List out the content in the document
06:55 - and you don't have anything in the
06:58 - test now for creating
07:02 - document uh there is a there is a
07:06 - command called Nano this is the uh
07:09 - software which is pre-installed in
07:11 - obuntu so whenever you give this command
07:17 - Nano so this Nano is a editor terminal
07:21 - editor in obuntu which is pre-installed
07:24 - in UB 2 or any Linux system I'm talking
07:28 - about UB 2 right now now okay so when
07:31 - you give this uh Nano command here and
07:34 - press enter
07:36 - you
07:38 - can make any file here so for example I
07:43 - write
07:46 - hello hello world and for saving this
07:49 - file I will I will uh just give the
07:53 - command control X you see here for
07:56 - exiting I need to give this command
07:59 - contr X so just give control and just
08:03 - press X and it will say it will ask you
08:06 - whether you want to save this file I
08:08 - will say yes so I will write y e s or Y
08:14 - and then it will ask me the name of the
08:16 - file which I want to give so I will I
08:18 - want to give my file name
08:21 - as HW for hell World okay file name is
08:26 - HW and I press enter and we are outside
08:32 - our from our Nano editor now when I uh
08:35 - when I list out all the contents in
08:38 - document folder Lis I can see this file
08:42 - called HW inside my folder and once
08:47 - again if I want to see the content of HW
08:50 - once again I will go I will give this
08:52 - command Nano HW so just give Nano and
08:57 - then give the name of the the file you
08:59 - want to open and press enter and you see
09:03 - we have entered hello world in this
09:07 - text which we have created and contr X
09:11 - will
09:11 - exit now suppose you want to remove this
09:15 - file what you need to do is you just
09:18 - need to give
09:19 - RM and then give the name of the file so
09:23 - RM and then give
09:27 - hws and whenever you get give this
09:29 - command it will remove your file so once
09:33 - again I will list out all the contents
09:35 - in the folder and I see here there is no
09:40 - folder okay so these are some of the
09:43 - basic commands in Linux and I was uh
09:48 - showing this tutorial on obun 2 you can
09:52 - use this on Linux Min or all Dean uh
09:56 - Linux operating system and
09:59 - just practice these commands on other
10:03 - Linux systems so I hope you have enjoyed
10:05 - this video please write comment and

hello guys in this video I'm going to teach you some of the basic terminal command in Linux terminal I'm using Ubuntu for this demonstration but this will work fine on any Linux uh operating system which has terminal commands so let's get started just open your terminal and the First Command we are going to see is PWD PWD stands for present working directory and as the name suggest it just gives you the present working directory in which we are in so by default uh we are in home folder or on open 2 okay now for example you want to list out all the directory in your home folder okay so what you can do is you can give the command LS for list listing out whatever files or directory are there in this obuntu home folder home obuntu folder okay so just give LS and press enter and it gives all the folder and document in this openo folder right now if you want to see the hidden files this only shows the nonhidden f files uh by this command so if you want to show the hidden file also what you can do is you can give the command Lis minus a a stand for all list all and you can see it will just print out all the files and which are hidden or not hidden all the files in the terminal now our terminal looks like like full right so to clear your terminal you can just give the command clear then it will clear your terminal okay so what is the command for clearing just write clear on the terminal now once again let's list out the all the directories and for example so uh in the current folder which we in in which we are in it has desktop folder documents folder and music public videos okay so for example you want to go inside your downloads folder or let's go to the documents folder first okay so what you uh need to do is you need to give this command CD so CD stand for current working directory and then give the name name of the folder in which you want to go okay so first you need to list out this uh this folders and if this folder is present there then just write CD then document and slash so whenever you write do here and press tab also it will autocomplete your search so for example you write do and press this tab button it will complete your search like this and press enter and now you are in documents folder let's see what is there in documents there is nothing in the documents so let's make a directory in your document folder so for making the directory in the folder you need to give this command mkd for make directory and then you need to give the name of the directory so just I will give the name of the directory as test and press enter and now I will list out all the directories in documents and I can see there is a new directory created called test now for example I want to go into this directory once again I will write CD and I will write test for example look here I'm giving this in capital letter which doesn't matches this test folder which is T and small EST I'm giving all capital and what happens it'll give you error because Linux is case sensitive whenever you want to go into some folder in Linux you need to give the exact spelling of the folder not in capital letter or not in uh small letter exact spelling so once again when I give CD test and we are in this directory now for example I want to go back one document up so right now I'm in test directory you see here so in here this shows that in which directory you are in the till this sign if you can see here this is a small sign it indicates that we are in our home folder and in home folder we are in documents and in document we are in test folder now once again I want to go to the last folder that is document right now we are in test folder right so for going one folder up you need to give this command CD space then dot dot okay so space is not like this CD dot dot this is not the command command is CD space dot dot and then you will go one folder up you see earlier it was we are we were in test folder and right now we are in document folder now for example let's list out once again we have test folder inside document and we want to uh delete this directory once uh this test directory which we have created so for remove moving this directory you need to give this command rmdir and give the name of the directory which is test and press enter and this command will remove the directory in your document folder so this command will remove the test directory I would say in your folder and now when you LS Or List out the content in the document and you don't have anything in the test now for creating document uh there is a there is a command called Nano this is the uh software which is preinstalled in obuntu so whenever you give this command Nano so this Nano is a editor terminal editor in obuntu which is preinstalled in UB 2 or any Linux system I'm talking about UB 2 right now now okay so when you give this uh Nano command here and press enter you can make any file here so for example I write hello hello world and for saving this file I will I will uh just give the command control X you see here for exiting I need to give this command contr X so just give control and just press X and it will say it will ask you whether you want to save this file I will say yes so I will write y e s or Y and then it will ask me the name of the file which I want to give so I will I want to give my file name as HW for hell World okay file name is HW and I press enter and we are outside our from our Nano editor now when I uh when I list out all the contents in document folder Lis I can see this file called HW inside my folder and once again if I want to see the content of HW once again I will go I will give this command Nano HW so just give Nano and then give the name of the the file you want to open and press enter and you see we have entered hello world in this text which we have created and contr X will exit now suppose you want to remove this file what you need to do is you just need to give RM and then give the name of the file so RM and then give hws and whenever you get give this command it will remove your file so once again I will list out all the contents in the folder and I see here there is no folder okay so these are some of the basic commands in Linux and I was uh showing this tutorial on obun 2 you can use this on Linux Min or all Dean uh Linux operating system and just practice these commands on other Linux systems so I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
