00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - while loop and do while loop in your PHP
00:08 - code in this video I'm going to show you
00:10 - how to use for Loop in your PHP for Loop
00:14 - is also a kind of loop but it's more
00:17 - flexible in a way that you don't need to
00:21 - uh declare these counter or increment
00:25 - counter like this you have to do in
00:27 - while loop you can do it in the
00:31 - construct of your for Loop these things
00:34 - and you don't need to uh declare them
00:37 - like this so for example first of all I
00:40 - will just delete all the code from here
00:43 - and I will just show you the construct
00:46 - or basic skeleton of fall Loop so the
00:49 - basic skeleton of the Fall Loop is like
00:52 - this you just use for keyword and then
00:56 - it's like while loop you give some
00:58 - condition in this bracket
01:00 - and in this curly braces you give your
01:03 - statement but this for Loop has
01:07 - three three uh categories here uh
01:11 - separated by the semicolon and first
01:14 - category is the initialization of the
01:17 - value you want to uh uh use second is
01:22 - the condition and third is the increment
01:25 - of the value so for example I want to
01:28 - achieve the same what I have uh uh done
01:31 - in the last video I want to print some
01:33 - string 10 times so how can I do it using
01:36 - for Loop just use
01:38 - for and then I would just give the basic
01:42 - construct to this for Loop and then what
01:46 - you do here
01:48 - is give declare a variable and
01:50 - initialize it by a value for example I
01:55 - declare some variable called counter
01:58 - like I have done in in the last
02:01 - video counter and I initialize this by
02:05 - one then I provide the semicolon here
02:09 - and then I provide the condition so I
02:11 - want to print something 10 times so I
02:14 - provide this condition if a counter is
02:18 - less than or equal to 10 I want to keep
02:23 - on Printing and then I will give the
02:25 - semicolon and then I increment the value
02:29 - so I will increment the value of counter
02:31 - once again like we were doing in the
02:33 - last video like this so you don't even
02:37 - need to declare this counter outside
02:39 - your fall Loop it'll take care of this
02:43 - initialization like this and it takes
02:45 - care of even the increment like this and
02:47 - now you can just
02:49 - uh Echo something for
02:58 - example
03:02 - programming knowledge and the counter by
03:04 - this
03:06 - concatenation uh
03:08 - symbol
03:10 - dot and I will give the break here
03:18 - also okay and I will save it and
03:22 - hopefully it will print the same thing
03:26 - okay so it prints the same thing here
03:30 - so fall Loop is also working like this
03:33 - but what is the flow of your code is
03:37 - first of all your code will come here
03:40 - it'll declare a variable and initialize
03:43 - this counter variable by one then it
03:47 - goes and checks this condition and on
03:51 - the basis of this condition for example
03:54 - it initialize this and counter is equal
03:57 - to one and
03:58 - counter which is one is less than 10
04:01 - then it execute this code and then
04:04 - performs increments okay first
04:08 - initialization then comparison then
04:11 - execution if the condition is true and
04:14 - then this
04:15 - increment uh happens okay so this is the
04:19 - flow of your for Loop so in this way you
04:23 - can use for Loop in your PHP code I hope
04:26 - you have enjoyed this video please rate

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use while loop and do while loop in your PHP code in this video I'm going to show you how to use for Loop in your PHP for Loop is also a kind of loop but it's more flexible in a way that you don't need to uh declare these counter or increment counter like this you have to do in while loop you can do it in the construct of your for Loop these things and you don't need to uh declare them like this so for example first of all I will just delete all the code from here and I will just show you the construct or basic skeleton of fall Loop so the basic skeleton of the Fall Loop is like this you just use for keyword and then it's like while loop you give some condition in this bracket and in this curly braces you give your statement but this for Loop has three three uh categories here uh separated by the semicolon and first category is the initialization of the value you want to uh uh use second is the condition and third is the increment of the value so for example I want to achieve the same what I have uh uh done in the last video I want to print some string 10 times so how can I do it using for Loop just use for and then I would just give the basic construct to this for Loop and then what you do here is give declare a variable and initialize it by a value for example I declare some variable called counter like I have done in in the last video counter and I initialize this by one then I provide the semicolon here and then I provide the condition so I want to print something 10 times so I provide this condition if a counter is less than or equal to 10 I want to keep on Printing and then I will give the semicolon and then I increment the value so I will increment the value of counter once again like we were doing in the last video like this so you don't even need to declare this counter outside your fall Loop it'll take care of this initialization like this and it takes care of even the increment like this and now you can just uh Echo something for example programming knowledge and the counter by this concatenation uh symbol dot and I will give the break here also okay and I will save it and hopefully it will print the same thing okay so it prints the same thing here so fall Loop is also working like this but what is the flow of your code is first of all your code will come here it'll declare a variable and initialize this counter variable by one then it goes and checks this condition and on the basis of this condition for example it initialize this and counter is equal to one and counter which is one is less than 10 then it execute this code and then performs increments okay first initialization then comparison then execution if the condition is true and then this increment uh happens okay so this is the flow of your for Loop so in this way you can use for Loop in your PHP code I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
