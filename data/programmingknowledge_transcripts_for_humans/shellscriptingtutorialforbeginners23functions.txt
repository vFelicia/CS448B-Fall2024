00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:03 - in this video and some of the next
00:06 - coming videos I am going to show you how
00:08 - functions works in shell scripting so
00:12 - let's get started
00:13 - so like any other programming language
00:15 - bash also supports function though they
00:19 - have somewhat limited implementations
00:22 - right now first of all what is a
00:25 - function a function is a subroutine or
00:28 - you can say it's a code block that
00:30 - implements a set of operations so for
00:34 - any user it's like a black box right it
00:40 - has some name and it implements some
00:44 - functionality and then later user can
00:48 - use this function once or multiple times
00:52 - so let's see an example and let's see
00:55 - how we can use functions in shell
00:59 - scripting so there are two ways of using
01:02 - functions one is like this and this is
01:07 - the first look at notation and for this
01:11 - you use a keyword function and then you
01:14 - give a name to your function and then
01:17 - you execute some commands right the
01:20 - second notation for the function is like
01:23 - this so you directly give the name to
01:26 - your function and then you give these
01:29 - parentheses and then you use these curly
01:33 - brackets and here comes your commands
01:37 - right so like this or like this so you
01:40 - can use functions like this in this
01:44 - notation or in this notation okay so we
01:48 - are going to see both of the notations
01:51 - and we will see how we can use it so
01:54 - let's say we want to print hello world
01:58 - using a function right so let's do it
02:03 - with this one we can just say hello here
02:08 - or you can add say anything using
02:12 - function right so you can give any name
02:16 - to a function and then we can you know
02:20 - give some commands inside this function
02:23 - inside these curly brackets so I'm going
02:25 - to just give echo and I am going to say
02:29 - hello here right and in the next
02:33 - function for example I want a function
02:37 - that whenever I call it it's going to
02:40 - quit the script right so let's say this
02:45 - function name is quit okay and what it
02:48 - does is it just calls this command which
02:51 - is going to exit our shell script right
02:54 - so let's use this function first of all
02:58 - this Hello function to print something
03:00 - so to use a function in a script you
03:05 - just call it okay so let's first run the
03:09 - script we have just declared these two
03:12 - functions right and whenever we run the
03:15 - script what happens nothing happens
03:17 - because we haven't called any function
03:20 - by its name so to call a function this
03:23 - is just the declaration of a function
03:25 - right so to call a function you just
03:27 - need to give the name of this function
03:30 - so for example I'm calling the function
03:32 - hello then I'm going to run the script
03:35 - is going to print hello right now let's
03:40 - call this function which is a quit
03:43 - function and I'm calling this quit
03:46 - function before hello function right and
03:49 - then let's say I'm just echoing
03:53 - something so I'm echoing for example
03:56 - some word whoo-hoo okay so let's run the
04:01 - script and let's see what happens so I'm
04:03 - going to just run the script and nothing
04:06 - happens because what we have done here
04:08 - is we have called a quit function first
04:12 - of all and quit function just creates
04:15 - the script and the chance of calling
04:19 - this or this does not come because this
04:22 - function is called first and it directly
04:25 - quits
04:26 - the script right let's see the sequence
04:31 - like this so first of all we call holo
04:34 - and then we call this squid function
04:37 - after the holo function and let's run
04:39 - the script and now holo is printed but
04:43 - this echo is not printed echo Fuu right
04:47 - because the sequence is something like
04:51 - this so first holo function is called
04:53 - and this is printed and then we call the
04:56 - squid so the script is exited and the
05:01 - chance of printing this does not come
05:04 - right then let's use this quit after the
05:09 - echo command and then once we run the
05:13 - script it prints hello from this
05:17 - function and then it prints fool from
05:20 - this command and then we call the quit
05:24 - function which exits the script
05:27 - okay so sequence of calling the function
05:31 - is important right so however you call
05:35 - the function in whatever sequence it
05:38 - will be called in that sequence so first
05:40 - of all we are calling the hello here
05:43 - then hello will be called and if you
05:47 - call you know quit at the top then quit
05:50 - will be called first and then the other
05:53 - function right so sequence is important
05:57 - and the function declaration can be done
06:01 - in any sequence right declaration can be
06:04 - done in any sequence but what matters is
06:07 - the calling of the function so on in
06:10 - whatever sequence you will call the
06:12 - function they will be called in that
06:14 - sequence right now second thing is how
06:18 - we can pass any argument to a function
06:22 - so there are some ways of passing some
06:27 - argument to our function and let's see
06:30 - how we can do it so call this function I
06:33 - have declared hello here right instead
06:36 - of hello I can just call for example
06:40 - print this is a print function right and
06:44 - then how it takes an argument or the
06:48 - argument can be used in the with the
06:52 - dollar symbol and then the number okay
06:56 - so one means the first argument then if
07:00 - we write 2 here then it means the second
07:03 - argument and then we write 3 here then
07:06 - it it means the third arguments for
07:09 - example dollar two is the second
07:11 - argument dollar 3 is the third argument
07:14 - and so on right so what we want now is
07:19 - what we want now is we want to call this
07:23 - print function right so we can just call
07:25 - this print function and how we can do or
07:28 - give our an argument you can just give
07:32 - the name whatever name or whatever
07:36 - argument you want to give after the name
07:39 - of the function so whenever you call
07:43 - this function and give this argument it
07:46 - goes here as the argument 1 + hello will
07:51 - be printed so let's see what happens so
07:54 - you can see a hollow will be printed and
07:55 - then who is printed and then we quit the
07:59 - application using this function now we
08:01 - can call a function multiple times so we
08:04 - can say hello world here and then you
08:09 - can see it prints hello
08:11 - and then world and then foo right so you
08:15 - can call it multiple times so hello
08:17 - world and then we can say again here
08:21 - right and then we run the script I says
08:26 - hello world again so you can call a
08:29 - function with multiple times with
08:32 - multiple arguments right and you can
08:36 - call the function in sequence ok let's
08:39 - give some other arguments here so you
08:43 - can give $2 to and then you can give
08:47 - dollar creature right and instead of
08:50 - calling it multiple times you can just
08:53 - care
08:54 - this world as a second argument and
08:57 - again as a third argument and then I'm
09:01 - going to just remove these callings and
09:04 - then run the script for example and it
09:08 - prints hello world again because we are
09:11 - capturing these argument using are these
09:14 - you know variables so variable one is
09:18 - for first argument variable two is for
09:20 - second argument and variable three is
09:22 - for the third argument right so this is
09:26 - the introduction to function function
09:29 - have more functionality than this simple
09:33 - operations and this we are going to see
09:35 - in the next videos so I hope you've
09:38 - enjoyed this video please rate comment

hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video and some of the next coming videos I am going to show you how functions works in shell scripting so let's get started so like any other programming language bash also supports function though they have somewhat limited implementations right now first of all what is a function a function is a subroutine or you can say it's a code block that implements a set of operations so for any user it's like a black box right it has some name and it implements some functionality and then later user can use this function once or multiple times so let's see an example and let's see how we can use functions in shell scripting so there are two ways of using functions one is like this and this is the first look at notation and for this you use a keyword function and then you give a name to your function and then you execute some commands right the second notation for the function is like this so you directly give the name to your function and then you give these parentheses and then you use these curly brackets and here comes your commands right so like this or like this so you can use functions like this in this notation or in this notation okay so we are going to see both of the notations and we will see how we can use it so let's say we want to print hello world using a function right so let's do it with this one we can just say hello here or you can add say anything using function right so you can give any name to a function and then we can you know give some commands inside this function inside these curly brackets so I'm going to just give echo and I am going to say hello here right and in the next function for example I want a function that whenever I call it it's going to quit the script right so let's say this function name is quit okay and what it does is it just calls this command which is going to exit our shell script right so let's use this function first of all this Hello function to print something so to use a function in a script you just call it okay so let's first run the script we have just declared these two functions right and whenever we run the script what happens nothing happens because we haven't called any function by its name so to call a function this is just the declaration of a function right so to call a function you just need to give the name of this function so for example I'm calling the function hello then I'm going to run the script is going to print hello right now let's call this function which is a quit function and I'm calling this quit function before hello function right and then let's say I'm just echoing something so I'm echoing for example some word whoohoo okay so let's run the script and let's see what happens so I'm going to just run the script and nothing happens because what we have done here is we have called a quit function first of all and quit function just creates the script and the chance of calling this or this does not come because this function is called first and it directly quits the script right let's see the sequence like this so first of all we call holo and then we call this squid function after the holo function and let's run the script and now holo is printed but this echo is not printed echo Fuu right because the sequence is something like this so first holo function is called and this is printed and then we call the squid so the script is exited and the chance of printing this does not come right then let's use this quit after the echo command and then once we run the script it prints hello from this function and then it prints fool from this command and then we call the quit function which exits the script okay so sequence of calling the function is important right so however you call the function in whatever sequence it will be called in that sequence so first of all we are calling the hello here then hello will be called and if you call you know quit at the top then quit will be called first and then the other function right so sequence is important and the function declaration can be done in any sequence right declaration can be done in any sequence but what matters is the calling of the function so on in whatever sequence you will call the function they will be called in that sequence right now second thing is how we can pass any argument to a function so there are some ways of passing some argument to our function and let's see how we can do it so call this function I have declared hello here right instead of hello I can just call for example print this is a print function right and then how it takes an argument or the argument can be used in the with the dollar symbol and then the number okay so one means the first argument then if we write 2 here then it means the second argument and then we write 3 here then it it means the third arguments for example dollar two is the second argument dollar 3 is the third argument and so on right so what we want now is what we want now is we want to call this print function right so we can just call this print function and how we can do or give our an argument you can just give the name whatever name or whatever argument you want to give after the name of the function so whenever you call this function and give this argument it goes here as the argument 1 + hello will be printed so let's see what happens so you can see a hollow will be printed and then who is printed and then we quit the application using this function now we can call a function multiple times so we can say hello world here and then you can see it prints hello and then world and then foo right so you can call it multiple times so hello world and then we can say again here right and then we run the script I says hello world again so you can call a function with multiple times with multiple arguments right and you can call the function in sequence ok let's give some other arguments here so you can give $2 to and then you can give dollar creature right and instead of calling it multiple times you can just care this world as a second argument and again as a third argument and then I'm going to just remove these callings and then run the script for example and it prints hello world again because we are capturing these argument using are these you know variables so variable one is for first argument variable two is for second argument and variable three is for the third argument right so this is the introduction to function function have more functionality than this simple operations and this we are going to see in the next videos so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
