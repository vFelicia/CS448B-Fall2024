With timestamps:

00:00 - hello everyone and I welcome you all to
00:03 - another video of our web development
00:04 - series and
00:06 - we have leveled up all right so we have
00:09 - you know learned
00:12 - uh respectable amount of HTML like you
00:17 - would be required to make any
00:22 - um you know representable form of web
00:25 - page uh you would be able to do it
00:27 - you know we talked about forms and we
00:30 - talked about tables we talked about
00:32 - lists we talk about you know basic HTML
00:34 - boilerplates and everything
00:36 - all right and there are other things
00:39 - which I don't feel necessary but if you
00:43 - want you who can look for it I mean
00:46 - iframe is there and
00:48 - some other stuff you can look that on
00:50 - your own all right
00:52 - so from this video we would be starting
00:55 - uh CSS all right
00:57 - so what does CSS stands for CSS stands
01:00 - for cascading
01:04 - styling sheet
01:09 - hold it
01:10 - just put it here let's create okay
01:15 - cool
01:16 - now what are the reasons yeah CSS is
01:20 - used
01:21 - why can't we just you know use HTML for
01:24 - the selling because see HTML stylings
01:29 - if you talk about
01:32 - um
01:34 - it is not preferred all right because
01:36 - see because of HTML styling the
01:41 - alignment gets all messed up
01:43 - all right let me write alignment
01:48 - all right and sometimes it does not
01:50 - produce the
01:53 - correct
01:55 - result as well okay
01:58 - it messes the layout now let's just go
02:02 - quickly and check CSS
02:05 - h
02:09 - mdn box
02:11 - all right
02:17 - so CSS cascading style sheets so it is
02:22 - you know basically a stat sheet language
02:24 - used to describe the presentation of
02:26 - markup languages so markup languages
02:28 - include HTML or XML
02:31 - okay and then all other things as well
02:35 - all right so currently uh that is all
02:39 - the theory you should be knowing about
02:40 - CSS okay
02:42 - and let's do one thing let's go here and
02:46 - let's see how do we add our you know
02:50 - CSS so let's do one thing
02:53 - let's write style dot CSS
02:57 - and how do we basically link it with our
03:01 - HTML
03:03 - so here you just write
03:09 - link CSS
03:12 - okay actually Ariel is basically
03:15 - relationship which is style sheet almost
03:18 - all right then there is uh hyper
03:21 - reference which is this styles.css okay
03:24 - cool
03:26 - now let's just go to style.css
03:29 - and how do we basically style the things
03:33 - so just just you know let's go uh and
03:37 - see what the web page look like okay
03:39 - this look like this cool
03:41 - now what if I have to add the background
03:46 - uh here what I'll do I'll simply write
03:51 - background color
03:53 - CSS mdn
03:57 - all right I'll just
04:00 - go here
04:02 - I just go here I just check it how we do
04:05 - it
04:07 - so we use the background color
04:12 - like this okay
04:14 - so let us sit there all right now what
04:20 - we
04:22 - do exactly is
04:25 - C
04:27 - suppose I have to
04:32 - uh
04:34 - modify the whole area there right
04:37 - so
04:40 - I'll be using a tag there right
04:44 - okay and
04:47 - how do we like exactly use the
04:52 - um
04:53 - attacking and everything oh let's see I
04:57 - go here
04:59 - see this Tiger's body I'll simply say
05:02 - body
05:05 - and I'll open this thing
05:08 - and
05:09 - I'll write here
05:12 - background color
05:14 - and I got a very nice background color
05:18 - so I'll just write the background color
05:21 - code it's e a f
05:25 - and then I'll write 6 F6 all right
05:31 - I receive it
05:32 - go here
05:35 - see background color has again it is
05:38 - looking kind of pretty all right like at
05:41 - least two minutes
05:42 - kind of looking fitty to me all right
05:45 - so that is one thing then you can
05:50 - you know the changes in the H1 as well
05:53 - okay let's do one thing let's add this
05:56 - one
05:57 - and let's see how do we know add color
06:01 - in the text
06:03 - I'll just simply say
06:05 - X color CSS mdn
06:07 - we'll go here we'll see how it works so
06:10 - it's just simply color the color
06:12 - property set the foreground color value
06:14 - of an element text and text decoration
06:17 - set the current color value okay so
06:21 - we'll just come here we'll simply write
06:23 - color
06:24 - and again I got a very nice color which
06:28 - is 6X p f p f
06:34 - okay it's the same rate let's see
06:36 - how it works
06:42 - see
06:43 - a form is already looking kinda pretty
06:46 - right
06:48 - I mean at least for me
06:51 - okay
06:52 - so yeah that is one thing then we can
06:57 - have another thing
06:59 - here as called
07:02 - line
07:05 - there it is simply say Center and see
07:10 - okay this should have been word I mean
07:15 - a line
07:21 - okay I don't know okay
07:27 - let's just simply say align text
07:32 - CSS mdn
07:37 - okay it's texture line
07:40 - so here we just simply write
07:43 - text align Center let's save it let's go
07:46 - let's see
07:48 - see I mean
07:51 - kind of looking very nice right
07:55 - so cool so there's one thing you should
07:58 - be able to very good at Google search
08:01 - for CSS I mean
08:03 - because
08:05 - uh these properties are like in
08:08 - thousands all right so you won't be able
08:11 - to you know
08:12 - learn about every one of them but you
08:15 - should be able to know like what you
08:17 - want to do like I know about here that I
08:20 - want to align my text somewhere so just
08:23 - simply write align text CSS right
08:27 - that's what you have to do there
08:29 - so I guess that was it for the
08:33 - introductory video of CSS uh so let's
08:36 - just quickly review what we talked about
08:38 - here
08:39 - we talked about CSS its reform why don't
08:41 - we use HTML styling over CSS then
08:46 - we learned about linking CSS style sheet
08:49 - to our HTML then how basically we style
08:53 - everything
08:54 - we use the tag like body tag I use it
08:58 - um
08:59 - modified body the H1 tag at modified
09:02 - action
09:03 - like that okay in this video
09:06 - we are going to look at CSS syntax or
09:10 - you can say anatomy of CSS okay
09:14 - so in the previous video we learned
09:17 - about how you know you can add CSS file
09:20 - inside your HTML file
09:22 - so just to give you a quick recap I'm
09:24 - just going
09:25 - I'm just going to put one index dot h
09:30 - tml here I'm going to add
09:38 - okay something is wrong
09:44 - foreign
09:57 - [Music]
10:05 - [Music]
10:17 - [Music]
10:23 - okay I named it index.css so
10:26 - let's just change it to index.css
10:31 - okay
10:33 - now I'll show you
10:37 - how you know CSS syntax is written
10:40 - I mean I did show you in the previous
10:42 - one but let's see
10:44 - how like what is the breakage of it
10:48 - so you can say the breakage of system
10:53 - taxes
10:55 - it is something like
10:58 - selector
11:01 - okay
11:06 - and then inside of it
11:09 - [Applause]
11:09 - um
11:09 - [Music]
11:11 - there is
11:14 - property
11:21 - and then there is
11:27 - um
11:29 - selection let's see
11:37 - okay
11:38 - and these are all in the curly brackets
11:44 - now see this selector this is basically
11:48 - oh
11:52 - like who we need to change okay
11:58 - property is what
12:01 - that means okay we know what like who we
12:05 - need to change exactly or you can say
12:07 - which
12:08 - but what inside that selector we need to
12:11 - change so that is defined by
12:14 - property what
12:17 - and this tells us
12:20 - how much
12:21 - like what you want to change like if you
12:24 - want to you know
12:27 - give it a width how much width you want
12:31 - to like make it bold how much bold
12:33 - that is told by the selection
12:37 - what is sold by the property and who is
12:40 - stored by the selector
12:42 - now let's try and implement this a bit
12:45 - let's see how it works
12:48 - here I'm going to have an H1
12:51 - here I'm going to say
12:53 - in the text
12:54 - and then I'm going to have a p where I'm
12:57 - going to say
13:04 - paragraph text
13:05 - I'll go to my index here I'll select who
13:09 - or what
13:11 - I want to change I want to change H1
13:16 - okay
13:18 - inside action what I want to change I'll
13:21 - just say let's say
13:23 - color
13:25 - how much or what should be the color
13:27 - here yeah let's say aqua
13:30 - I'll save it
13:32 - I automate it and I'll just click on
13:34 - goli
13:41 - okay why haven't it been changed
13:58 - it is
14:00 - index.chers and here it is
14:04 - CSS
14:07 - let's do one thing let's say it
14:10 - style.css and here we will use
14:15 - our
14:18 - rename it
14:25 - let's suppose it works
14:30 - okay that is weird
14:33 - Y is set not working
14:38 - foreign
14:52 - [Music]
14:56 - elements like H1 element of P element
14:59 - you want to
15:01 - you know change we just directly write
15:03 - them as I told you in the previous video
15:06 - but if you like suppose add something
15:09 - called a class here
15:12 - of H1 let's say
15:15 - then if you want to you know
15:17 - uh
15:19 - modify this specific class only then you
15:21 - put dot okay it's not relevant right now
15:24 - but just you know telling you I mean
15:27 - this class would come in the future
15:29 - video so don't you know worry about it
15:32 - but anyways we see you know
15:35 - what we change
15:37 - like
15:38 - movie change what inside that we change
15:41 - and by how much we change or what is
15:43 - that we change
15:45 - okay nice
15:47 - similarly you can have the paragraph tag
15:51 - as well let's see
15:53 - okay and it looks nice let's see
16:01 - you can increase the font size
16:05 - let's see
16:09 - uh learn two
16:15 - great
16:16 - so this was you know basically the
16:18 - anatomy of cases syntax selector
16:20 - property selection to what how much okay
16:24 - so in the previous video we learned
16:26 - about the anatomy of CSS right
16:31 - then we talked about yeah
16:35 - um
16:36 - the prop the values the selectors and
16:40 - everything and we looked at how website
16:43 - looks let's just
16:44 - Collide here
16:46 - okay my bad HTML
16:50 - okay let's close that and it's Collide
16:52 - now
16:54 - okay so this is what it looks like all
16:57 - right
16:58 - now
17:02 - um in the previous video
17:05 - we came up with a
17:07 - with the problem right
17:10 - so uh what I wanted was to change the
17:15 - colors of these two decks right
17:18 - I wanted this to be in black and I
17:21 - wanted this to be an uh
17:26 - but when I use the
17:29 - P here so both of these would get uh the
17:34 - same color
17:35 - so here the confusion arises right what
17:39 - to do now
17:41 - so since till now we have talked about
17:44 - uh selectors which are just tags like
17:48 - etch on tag P tag
17:54 - but now we are going to look at more CSS
17:57 - selectors
17:59 - schools
18:07 - and you can see spot assist selectors
18:10 - you already know but let's read it again
18:12 - so uh
18:15 - basically selects the HTM element you
18:19 - understand
18:21 - all right
18:23 - now there are different type of CSS
18:26 - selectors
18:28 - okay uh you can divide the CSS selectors
18:31 - into five category
18:34 - so there are simple selectors then there
18:38 - are combinators pseudo class you do
18:41 - elements and attributes
18:43 - okay
18:44 - so if you go to combinator selectors you
18:48 - can see a combinator something that
18:50 - explains a relationship between these
18:52 - characters
18:53 - so this would be I guess uh later
19:00 - too much for you
19:02 - okay
19:03 - so right now we are not going to talk
19:06 - about the combination one we'll talk at
19:09 - about any further coming videos
19:11 - but uh till then uh let's just talk
19:15 - about the simple selectors about in the
19:17 - simple selector we have only used the
19:19 - tag name okay
19:23 - so simple CSS selectors it contains
19:26 - ID
19:29 - and class
19:31 - okay
19:33 - so ID is used by a hashtag sign and
19:38 - class is used by a DOT okay we'll talk
19:42 - about how we'll do that okay
19:45 - and then there is a universal selected
19:48 - as well
19:49 - okay
19:51 - and the letters we talked about and yeah
19:56 - okay okay that is cool that is good
19:59 - right
20:01 - so let's just head back to our virtual
20:04 - Studio code and let's learn what we just
20:07 - ready so here we'll just write
20:11 - um ID okay
20:13 - and let's just name it
20:17 - and here we have a class which would be
20:19 - named black for now
20:24 - yeah
20:26 - okay
20:29 - now here what uh we'll do we'll comment
20:33 - this so I hope you know what a comment
20:36 - is so comment is basically
20:38 - a part of the code which is basically
20:41 - not
20:43 - executed or compiled
20:45 - so it is understood by the compiler that
20:47 - this is just for the documentation
20:48 - purposes and we don't need to compile
20:50 - this okay so it tells you by forward
20:52 - slash star
20:55 - and then you can have this chart again
20:58 - and forward slash
21:00 - okay okay
21:03 - that looks well
21:08 - oh
21:11 - okay let's talk about the universal
21:14 - directors
21:15 - the open Universal selector right
21:19 - now I'll just save it okay there is
21:21 - another
21:23 - warning okay
21:26 - now here I'll simply write uh
21:30 - font family
21:34 - on family is basically used for changing
21:38 - the font style so let's suppose with
21:40 - this right now
21:42 - okay let's just save it
21:47 - okay only one
21:52 - okay
21:53 - [Music]
21:59 - okay okay okay okay okay
22:02 - [Music]
22:04 - um
22:07 - [Music]
22:12 - okay
22:15 - you're the same thing here but oh is it
22:18 - not working let's go here outside
22:20 - property okay that is
22:24 - in one
22:27 - on red
22:34 - oh
22:36 - let's just go back here we have saved it
22:39 - let's just go here
22:41 - okay let's just observe this now we'll
22:45 - go back here again
22:46 - and other than this what
22:50 - you can have
22:53 - equal that's right let's see where let's
22:57 - go back here
23:01 - [Applause]
23:04 - uh
23:08 - let's have this okay
23:12 - okay it is still not changing I am still
23:15 - not sure why is that happening
23:17 - let's just go to the Bluetooth
23:19 - [Music]
23:37 - okay okay let's try it for ourselves
23:45 - um you can see that
23:48 - there are different ones why are we not
23:52 - having that thing
23:57 - behind anything okay
24:02 - let's try two one two one thing it is
24:05 - copy it from here
24:07 - relationship
24:11 - okay
24:13 - it's still not working let's just go to
24:14 - selected back again
24:17 - Universal selector is like this only
24:19 - okay let's just do one thing let's just
24:23 - try to put the color here for now
24:26 - and let's just say I'm not black let's
24:29 - say so let's see where let's just go
24:32 - here
24:41 - in this part from here let's go okay
24:46 - this thing is working
24:49 - okay
24:54 - hmm
24:56 - or family
25:07 - hmm
25:13 - let's just try the font I'm leaving
25:16 - again
25:18 - or let's just support Target right now
25:21 - okay I just don't want to miss you don't
25:23 - see that it always you can check the
25:25 - phone from everything on your own on
25:26 - your own system Maybe
25:28 - uh
25:33 - we'll see what it is all right
25:37 - so okay but never mind uh we're talking
25:39 - about friends so let's have one thing
25:41 - here uh
25:43 - let's have the class which was back okay
25:48 - and here we have the color as
25:52 - black okay let's save it
25:54 - and let's just have ID
26:04 - favorite Let's uh
26:07 - let's go here
26:11 - oh sorry oh it should be
26:16 - good
26:25 - what's the problem now
26:28 - okay
26:30 - let's save it
26:38 - this is in Black
26:41 - so
26:43 - both are the same paragraph type but IDs
26:48 - and classes these are the main selectors
26:50 - you can you know
26:52 - um select and then
26:55 - uh code code snippet and style it
27:01 - accordingly all right
27:03 - so I guess the symbol selectors was all
27:06 - this video are in the next video we'll
27:08 - talk about the difference between class
27:10 - and ID and I welcome you all to another
27:12 - video of our web development series and
27:15 - in this video we are going to talk about
27:17 - IDs versus Plus
27:21 - okay so I hope you remember how we used
27:23 - Class
27:25 - how we use class and how we use ID
27:29 - just to give you a quick recap
27:31 - uh we type class we give it some class
27:34 - name and we use
27:38 - dot for that
27:40 - okay
27:41 - and for simple like for ID views hashtag
27:46 - ID let's just say for now okay
27:49 - great we can just remove everything from
27:51 - here and I'll remove this class as well
27:53 - we'll just start a fish
27:58 - let's see what happens
28:00 - okay simple nothing nothing important
28:02 - here
28:03 - okay great
28:05 - now
28:07 - you might think that
28:10 - okay idea like they have similar
28:13 - functions right
28:14 - but remember they are not the same and
28:17 - they do not always share the same
28:19 - purpose okay
28:21 - if I talk about
28:25 - um
28:28 - where's my star
28:33 - okay
28:35 - now what if I talk about IDs
28:41 - so first point is that each
28:48 - element
28:50 - can have
28:52 - only one ID
28:55 - okay
28:56 - suppose this is my header and there are
28:59 - two IDs let's say
29:02 - um sample one sample two
29:04 - sample one
29:07 - sample 2 and if I save it
29:12 - and let's just say I write hashtag
29:18 - sample one
29:22 - and hashtag
29:23 - sample two yeah
29:26 - this is how it would work right
29:28 - and suppose here I give it font size
29:34 - 1.5 REM
29:38 - and here I give it
29:42 - Color actor let's see
29:46 - now if I go back to the website and if I
29:49 - refresh see nothing happened why because
29:52 - each element can have only one ID so
29:55 - according to our compiler sample one pay
29:59 - sample 2 is a single ID both are not
30:02 - treated as different IDs
30:04 - so suppose if I write class here and I
30:09 - just
30:12 - now if I go back to a site see it
30:15 - changed right
30:17 - so that is one difference between them
30:19 - let's just put
30:22 - let's just leave it okay
30:24 - then second Point uh which would be here
30:28 - would be
30:31 - each
30:33 - page
30:39 - can
30:42 - only one
30:46 - element
30:48 - with that ID
30:52 - okay
30:53 - now this is like you can have like that
30:58 - okay let me just show you what I'm
31:02 - talking about
31:03 - it's intuitive
31:07 - okay hashtag sample two
31:09 - uh let's remove this part let's say ID
31:15 - okay
31:22 - okay if I go back to the website both
31:25 - are converted right but here what we
31:27 - said each page can have only one element
31:29 - with that ID
31:31 - but
31:33 - this
31:35 - is like a practice for us like this is a
31:38 - good practice for us I mean we should
31:40 - give only one eye to one element okay
31:44 - it's not like you cannot use it multiple
31:46 - times you can
31:48 - but it was made for such a purpose all
31:51 - right
31:52 - okay I hope you understood that
31:56 - and
31:58 - more tilts is the difference
32:00 - obviously ID
32:03 - uses hashtag
32:08 - okay
32:11 - now if I talk about classes
32:15 - classes you know you can use
32:18 - same class or multiple elements that is
32:20 - the practice we use dot in the class
32:26 - and you can use multiple classes on a
32:29 - single element not like this and classes
32:31 - are
32:33 - like there is a rule for writing class
32:35 - uh let me just say
32:41 - you can not have a class
32:47 - name with a
32:50 - spacing
32:52 - positive space con compiler would think
32:55 - that both are different classes which we
32:57 - just sorted here right okay
32:59 - so that was another example and
33:04 - play yes that was all the difference
33:06 - between IDs and classes
33:09 - like these three differences are there
33:11 - and one of these differences there
33:14 - okay
33:15 - and I'm again telling you this line each
33:17 - page can have only one element with that
33:19 - ID
33:20 - it is not a rule it is basically a
33:24 - practice which is used by most of the
33:26 - developers and you should
33:27 - follow the same okay
33:30 - so I guess that was all for this video
33:33 - hello everyone and welcome you all to
33:36 - another video of our web develop series
33:40 - so for the past few videos we have in
33:43 - talking about you know CSS we talked
33:46 - about the introduction to it
33:49 - we talked about the selectors we talked
33:51 - about the anatomy and few other stuff
33:54 - right
33:55 - if I
33:57 - just go live
33:58 - this is what our website looks like I
34:01 - mean
34:02 - we talked about different things here
34:04 - right so that is there
34:06 - so in
34:09 - this video or like I should say from
34:12 - this video onwards we'd be working on
34:16 - um website uh personal website basically
34:19 - I mean it's not going to be a simple uh
34:23 - CV website which we made there because
34:27 - play
34:28 - it was a very basic one right
34:31 - I mean if someone sees it they won't
34:33 - find it very attractive or anything like
34:35 - that
34:36 - right
34:39 - so
34:41 - that is there now let's go back to here
34:45 - and let's see what exactly we are going
34:47 - to make
34:48 - so this is one of the websites which I
34:54 - personally liked very much
34:57 - so this guy name is Sean helpin all
35:00 - right this is his website
35:03 - and you can see this cover page it looks
35:06 - uh really nice here like see this is
35:09 - written here
35:11 - right
35:13 - um and you can see there are other users
35:16 - like it's a very neat website right
35:20 - there are different stuff here and there
35:23 - as well so yeah
35:25 - all in all there are many stuff which
35:29 - is available here okay
35:33 - so in this video we are like try to
35:37 - imitate this website and make it our own
35:39 - all right so before we
35:42 - uh
35:46 - [Music]
35:48 - a few things for me
35:50 - I'll just clear my sheets here
35:53 - okay first thing is
36:06 - just give me a minute
36:11 - okay this is not okay I don't remember
36:13 - them
36:14 - let's go back here let's see how to add
36:18 - comments in HTML
36:21 - okay
36:24 - so this is the way
36:32 - all right
36:33 - so first step is uh
36:36 - create a new folder
36:40 - and writers
36:42 - my personal page
36:45 - okay
36:47 - then I want you to
36:50 - create an index Dot
36:53 - HTML
36:56 - okay then
36:57 - [Music]
36:59 - add boilerplate
37:04 - title
37:05 - your name whatever it is
37:09 - uh
37:11 - create
37:15 - style.css and
37:18 - link
37:21 - both of them
37:23 - and add
37:25 - blue
37:30 - background color so this is your task
37:32 - okay try and do it
37:35 - okay
37:37 - so of course this you don't try to do
37:39 - whatever the steps I told you all right
37:42 - so here I'll go with my
37:44 - explanation we'll add the boilerplate I
37:48 - mean this
37:49 - this and this is already done with me so
37:52 - I just start from here I have added the
37:55 - boilerplate I'll just add the title
37:58 - so my name is
38:00 - so I'll just do that I'll save it
38:04 - and then what I have already like
38:06 - created this childhood CSS as well so
38:08 - you just do it on your own and then you
38:10 - have to basically link them so just link
38:13 - and hrf style.css
38:17 - now here Simply Red body
38:22 - background color as
38:25 - blue saved
38:28 - okay
38:45 - okay my part
38:48 - here
38:59 - okay so there's the shoes that we have
39:02 - successfully
39:05 - um created a sheet and linked them all
39:08 - right
39:09 - now now another thing I want to talk to
39:13 - you guys is
39:14 - um
39:15 - before going deep into you know making
39:18 - the site there's something I want to
39:21 - talk about as favicons
39:23 - so you can see here at the Sean's site
39:27 - he got a little I couldn't write here
39:32 - right
39:34 - um
39:36 - so how to do that so what you have to do
39:38 - is write here we go on
39:42 - IO
39:45 - all right
39:47 - let's just go here
39:51 - let's have the text as yes
39:54 - right
39:55 - that works
39:58 - so this is what it should you know look
40:01 - like
40:02 - foreign
40:09 - so just show in folder
40:16 - um
40:19 - let's just try to open this one
40:25 - okay looks well
40:27 - if I open this one
40:30 - okay then what is this one exactly all
40:35 - right
40:37 - so what I'll do I'll just simply cut
40:39 - this
40:40 - I'll just go to the web def folder and
40:43 - I'll just paste it here
40:46 - I'll just save it okay now what I'll do
40:48 - I'll go here
40:50 - what I'm going to do I'll simply click
40:53 - on link this time link is not relative
40:56 - style sheet
40:58 - it's
41:00 - icon and it is
41:04 - right let's save it
41:06 - let's go here
41:08 - and you can see we got that beautiful
41:10 - icon right there with the name
41:13 - so you can have different things I mean
41:16 - you can
41:18 - go here you can add some emojis text PNG
41:21 - or something all right
41:23 - so that works now there's another thing
41:26 - that
41:28 - this uh might not work on some of the
41:32 - cases
41:33 - so what you have to do here is just
41:35 - change the relationship to
41:38 - favicon save it
41:44 - okay I mean see this would not work for
41:47 - me but it would work for you then all
41:49 - right
41:50 - and here what you have to do
42:00 - okay
42:01 - you might be wondering what is all this
42:02 - stuff so I would not go into detain over
42:05 - these things
42:06 - all right this is about basically the
42:09 - caching system which I don't uh thing is
42:14 - necessary for you to learn in this
42:15 - course so yeah here we go track it back
42:18 - now there's another thing you might see
42:20 - on Sean subsiders that it has got you
42:23 - know different divisions like see this
42:26 - division is a different thing
42:28 - then it got different divisions here and
42:31 - there and everything the positionings
42:33 - and everything
42:35 - I don't think so we have talked about
42:37 - right
42:38 - so in the next video we are going to
42:40 - talk about
42:42 - um how to you know add these divisions
42:44 - to which we can style differently and
42:46 - add
42:47 - different blocks in our code all right
42:49 - so many more to come uh in the next
42:52 - video so thank you for thank you for
42:54 - watching this video and see you later
42:57 - and I welcome you all to another video
43:00 - of our web development series
43:03 - so in the previous video we learned that
43:06 - we are going to make a new project on
43:09 - CSS along with it we learn a few
43:13 - Concepts as you will
43:15 - all right so if I do one thing if I go
43:20 - live
43:22 - we see what exactly I have it until now
43:27 - so till now we have you know basically
43:30 - made our
43:33 - boilerplate and styling sheet and Link
43:36 - them and
43:38 - to
43:41 - uh uh you know
43:43 - check
43:45 - uh
43:47 - the linking if it is right or not we
43:51 - have added a blue color right here okay
43:54 - so for now I'll just remove this look uh
44:01 - okay so now I'll just you know simply
44:03 - remove this
44:06 - all right so it is like this and then
44:10 - again one more thing was we have added
44:13 - an icon
44:15 - which is this favicon which you can see
44:17 - right here okay cool
44:21 - now let's do one thing let's try and
44:24 - implement this thing like
44:27 - what whatever is written here
44:30 - so you can see that this is an H1 and
44:33 - this is the
44:36 - paragraph
44:37 - so let's let's do the same thing here
44:42 - H1
44:47 - um
44:47 - sure
44:50 - then let's write a paragraph tag
44:53 - foreign
44:54 - okay
44:57 - [Music]
45:01 - so
45:04 - okay uh as you can see here
45:07 - and if you see here
45:10 - in a different right
45:13 - I mean
45:14 - in this website it looks like the both
45:17 - are in close Inside the Box
45:19 - and if we see R it looks like they are
45:22 - very different right
45:24 - so what is different there exactly so
45:27 - let's just think click on inspect and
45:30 - see
45:33 - okay so this is basically I remember but
45:36 - if you can see there's something called
45:39 - div
45:41 - okay
45:44 - now you might be wondering what div is
45:48 - exactly right
45:50 - so we just go Dev MDM
45:56 - okay
45:59 - so Dev basically stands for Content
46:01 - division element
46:04 - all right
46:13 - now it development is the generic
46:17 - container for flow content okay so it
46:20 - has basically no effect on the content
46:22 - or layout until styled in some way
46:26 - okay
46:29 - it might be a little confusing for you
46:31 - but let me tell you what David exactly
46:33 - do
46:34 - so if
46:36 - I want to Club these two together
46:40 - what I use I lose a day
46:43 - so tip basically helps us to you know
46:46 - divide our content into separate
46:48 - containers so that we can affect the
46:50 - layout of each of the containers
46:52 - differently all right
46:55 - so what I can do here is
46:58 - I can write there
47:00 - right
47:03 - and I can simply
47:07 - paste it here
47:09 - but if you see
47:11 - not much of a difference you might be
47:13 - wondering what is this right but let me
47:16 - tell you
47:17 - uh
47:21 - the Sony Indian dogs if it is open yeah
47:25 - it is
47:26 - that it has no effect until in some way
47:31 - CSS is applied here
47:34 - so we need to apply a CSS right
47:41 - now before we talk about the CSS part I
47:44 - want to mention a few things right here
47:48 - uh that would be that then we think of a
47:52 - div basically spans from this corner
47:55 - to this corner and its height is equal
47:58 - to whatever the content is inside that
48:00 - thing all right that is a very important
48:04 - point which I wanted to mention in front
48:06 - of you because in the future videos
48:08 - we'll talk about span and then we'll see
48:10 - what is the difference between span and
48:12 - a div all right
48:13 - okay so let's try and give a very nice
48:16 - background color to our text okay so
48:19 - before that we'll just simply go to
48:22 - Color Picker
48:24 - CSS
48:30 - so okay okay it's not like this it was I
48:35 - don't remember exactly
48:37 - uh what the site's name was
48:42 - okay but
48:44 - it had a very nice one let's let's try
48:48 - color palette pick up
48:53 - for
48:55 - HTML okay let's see
49:09 - okay I remember it was color red right
49:18 - okay okay
49:20 - uh these are the basic uh you know a
49:23 - very nice color palettes
49:26 - which we can use
49:29 - let's go with this one all right
49:33 - so I'll simply
49:36 - copy this color copy it
49:40 - I'll simply come here
49:43 - I'll simply say class equal to ddates
49:49 - right whoops
49:52 - and here I see details
49:59 - and here against the background color as
50:02 - okay yeah
50:09 - see
50:10 - okay this color is uh not very visible
50:15 - so I think I'm gonna choose this color
50:18 - maybe
50:22 - and sorry guys
50:24 - a little bit I have actually a little
50:27 - bit download code
50:29 - not anything is serious but yeah
50:32 - okay I have finished the color
50:35 - and yeah this looks far better right I
50:39 - mean this is visible color like that was
50:40 - a nice color but it was not visible on
50:42 - the white background
50:44 - but anyways uh let's let's continue okay
50:48 - so this is uh
50:50 - now if you look closely you might see
50:54 - that there is a gap here
50:56 - this is the gap pill under the Gap here
50:59 - as a
51:00 - what is this Gap exactly
51:02 - I mean
51:05 - I will use Dev nothing above anything to
51:08 - the left I think to the right why it is
51:10 - so
51:10 - this is because our web browsers have
51:14 - here
51:16 - in styling so they I mean if I go to
51:19 - it's not paid Source sorry for that
51:24 - I'm going to give go to inspect
51:29 - like this
51:33 - [Music]
51:43 - is not able to find that right now
51:49 - okay
51:51 - but never mind you can see that there's
51:53 - a gap
51:54 - how to reduce it so this is a very nice
51:57 - trick which I'm going to tell you
51:59 - so
52:00 - listen to it all right
52:04 - you don't have to do anywhere
52:07 - simply
52:10 - right body
52:12 - and here
52:15 - have the margin as zero
52:18 - and then I have actually
52:22 - and here margin top has zero
52:26 - save it let's see how okay
52:31 - everything looks perfect right
52:36 - yeah
52:39 - then there is
52:42 - a line content to Center let's see if it
52:46 - works I don't know much up oh it doesn't
52:52 - enter content of temp let's see how we
52:57 - do a
53:01 - okay text align
53:08 - with your Center let's see if it works
53:10 - now
53:12 - okay this is a start I mean this looks
53:15 - nice to me at least I told about
53:17 - remember this looks nice to me
53:20 - we have done a lot of things till now
53:23 - and in the last video we talked about uh
53:26 - development
53:28 - uh this
53:30 - okay
53:32 - then we see a website it looks something
53:35 - like this
53:36 - pretty nice I'd say and then we go to
53:39 - this website says what we're trying to
53:41 - make okay
53:42 - now uh in this video we're going to talk
53:46 - about
53:47 - Box model
53:49 - okay
53:50 - now you might be wondering what is a box
53:52 - Water right
53:55 - so
53:57 - let's go to outside let's try to inspect
54:03 - fully Box model should come all right
54:06 - so
54:16 - uh yeah
54:21 - okay everything okay this is what is
54:25 - called a box model
54:26 - okay
54:27 - so in HTML every element
54:35 - its own box
54:37 - if I write a paragraph tag it would have
54:40 - its own box all right
54:42 - so a box basically has three main
54:46 - attributes one is padding
54:48 - one is the Border
54:50 - Anonymous margin all right
54:53 - so one by one uh
54:56 - we are going to talk about each of those
54:58 - boxes
54:59 - and
55:02 - then we'll try to you know do something
55:09 - on our own to see how
55:13 - we see it all right if it makes sense to
55:18 - you
55:22 - okay
55:28 - so first we'll talk about the Border
55:31 - okay
55:32 - let's come here let's see what we can
55:35 - have
55:37 - uh okay we will draw it
55:40 - I will draw it suppose this is my box
55:43 - this is my development
55:45 - okay
55:47 - now this div element uh
55:51 - would have some border
55:54 - right
55:56 - if I go here it would have some border
56:00 - right
56:01 - now what would it look like
56:05 - oh this there are some border like this
56:09 - okay
56:12 - trading and closing it
56:15 - is called it
56:16 - border okay
56:19 - I hope it was a bit clear to you I
56:22 - really do
56:24 - okay
56:27 - now let's try and implement it let's see
56:30 - how it will look if you see it you would
56:32 - get it
56:33 - uh remove pattern understanding mode
56:36 - right away
56:37 - you know I order write solid and
56:43 - then we say
56:45 - order
56:49 - let's suppose
56:53 - okay
56:54 - this
57:01 - looks let's go to our side
57:09 - video
57:10 - [Music]
57:12 - right
57:17 - [Music]
57:20 - okay
57:22 - why can't you see the Border here
57:25 - okay since there goes the whole part
57:28 - let's have a height
57:31 - of 200 pixels for now
57:35 - and uh width of 200 pixel
57:41 - now let's see
57:43 - we got it
57:46 - um yeah
57:51 - [Music]
57:53 - now let's do one time next is the
57:57 - background color too
58:01 - black
58:04 - okay okay so the color was
58:07 - actually equal to the background color
58:09 - right now so that's why you couldn't
58:11 - feel good this is the background I mean
58:14 - the Border you're talking about it
58:16 - trigger of 10 pixel my neck color is
58:19 - black
58:20 - right as you know and you can see the
58:23 - same thing is happening here okay
58:28 - now the other thing which we'll talk
58:30 - about is uh added
58:33 - so Suppose there is some content written
58:36 - inside a box
58:39 - so
58:41 - the
58:42 - distance between the content and the
58:45 - both edges
58:47 - mean difference
58:50 - or that edge or this Edge or message
58:57 - it is called
59:01 - padding
59:04 - okay
59:10 - it is called padding
59:13 - so what uh we are going to do is
59:20 - we are going to
59:24 - have a padding here
59:34 - [Music]
59:36 - let's save it
59:39 - [Music]
59:39 - um
59:42 - if I go
59:47 - and
59:52 - you can see that there's a padding
59:54 - around it
59:56 - I mean this is the content and there is
59:58 - the padding
59:59 - okay oh you might wondering
60:03 - okay there's not much of a change here
60:05 - what is the difference right
60:09 - that is motivated
60:12 - okay
60:14 - so let's just try to remove the body for
60:18 - now let's save it
60:20 - so let's see
60:22 - okay I can I see I mean I guess you
60:26 - might be it is different than me
60:29 - [Music]
60:33 - so guys safely add the padding
60:40 - and there we go
60:43 - by 200 and then you want to go into
60:45 - padding on the box
60:48 - then we go to border and the only thing
60:51 - that is left is uh we need to talk about
60:54 - is
60:57 - so margins
61:02 - a buffer zone okay
61:05 - it is basically you know uh
61:08 - the testing the current element and any
61:12 - other element that is on our screen
61:15 - so suppose
61:19 - okay
61:20 - there is this box as well let's call it
61:23 - Dev box only and the distance between
61:25 - them
61:29 - that is called the
61:33 - [Music]
61:33 - um
61:38 - okay
61:42 - so I hope uh
61:44 - thistles
61:46 - clear to you
61:50 - okay
61:59 - no
62:01 - okay so I told you about margin now
62:04 - there's one task which I would like to
62:07 - give you
62:09 - um
62:13 - okay so first thing you have to do is
62:18 - make one more container
62:22 - with
62:24 - [Music]
62:26 - height and
62:33 - that as
62:37 - 200 pixel only okay then the second
62:40 - point would be
62:43 - uh give it uh red color
62:48 - s
62:51 - the third thing would be
62:54 - change
62:57 - first I mean
63:01 - assign class to Port p divs
63:09 - then try
63:13 - or if you can't rewrite it but for now
63:16 - that is all you have to do okay
63:20 - so yeah I'm going to uh okay uh we can
63:24 - just change it to let's say
63:29 - first container
63:33 - so we have another div and we will have
63:37 - the class five
63:40 - second container
63:42 - and let's save it
63:44 - let's change it to
63:52 - let's go to website to see if it working
63:54 - if it is working it is working
64:00 - now let's add
64:06 - second container
64:10 - we'll have high dashboard pixel we have
64:13 - with uh 200 pixel what else
64:18 - uh background color will have your
64:22 - okay let's not do it let's see how our
64:25 - side looks now
64:28 - okay
64:30 - now one more thing I don't know if you
64:33 - might uh
64:35 - seen it or not but this is a total pixel
64:38 - box this is a 200 pixel box
64:40 - where is the difference make
64:43 - why am I getting uh so much High
64:46 - difference
64:49 - we'll talk about it so let's talk about
64:52 - this box
64:54 - [Music]
64:55 - yeah if I talk about this box
65:00 - extended and everything the address 200
65:02 - pixel
65:05 - but because of the padding which is you
65:08 - know 20 200 plus 220 that is 240
65:13 - if I talked about the border that would
65:16 - be 10 10 260.
65:18 - so that makes it greater than I mean
65:23 - it's because it the box size isn't
65:26 - compromised when we had the padding or
65:28 - when we add the Border
65:30 - all right even when we add imagine the
65:33 - box size is not compromised okay so
65:35 - please keep that in mind
65:38 - okay okay
65:40 - so anyway the next thing we had to do
65:42 - was just introduce margin here
65:48 - yes
65:59 - yes this
66:02 - we have separate margins as well
66:06 - um
66:08 - [Music]
66:12 - let's go let's save it
66:18 - from here
66:21 - no that's why I put the margin on the
66:24 - top of
66:25 - temperature as well
66:31 - between them becomes 20 pixel
66:35 - okay
66:37 - so this was the both model uh we had to
66:41 - talk about
66:45 - we basically had
66:47 - three maintenance padding model and
66:50 - margin
66:52 - so far we have learned a lot of things
66:54 - right let's go live and see
66:57 - uh uh okay okay uh I've had let's just
67:02 - close this
67:04 - um let's just go back here
67:06 - stop this for a while go to HTML and
67:10 - then we go live
67:12 - yeah Okay cool so we have like developed
67:17 - kind of a few things right so far okay
67:21 - cool
67:22 - uh now the question arises uh exactly
67:29 - that our site is not looking like the
67:32 - Sean's
67:34 - site
67:36 - right
67:39 - I mean yes it looks something like this
67:44 - which uh clearly doesn't
67:47 - so okay we'll try and do few things here
67:51 - to make our website look something like
67:55 - this let's go to style
67:57 - okay in the first container what I want
67:59 - is just remove the border with and
68:01 - Border color for now
68:04 - okay
68:05 - then we have textile and background
68:08 - color Okay erase all the things are fine
68:11 - okay
68:14 - something is still there which we don't
68:16 - want
68:19 - uh width is there let's move it let's
68:25 - let's have the padding
68:27 - let's remove the margin let's move the
68:30 - margin from here as well let's save it
68:35 - let's remove this solid border also
68:39 - let's save it
68:41 - okay
68:44 - um kind of works right
68:46 - I mean
68:48 - I can have the
68:51 - wet okay let's not have the weight right
68:54 - now okay
68:56 - cool
68:59 - okay now uh one thing I want to show you
69:02 - is
69:03 - uh this is my development project in the
69:07 - image I have two images
69:09 - one is cloud
69:11 - okay looks like this
69:14 - and one is Mountain which looks like
69:16 - this you can download your old images
69:19 - from the
69:21 - all right like the way I did it
69:25 - all right
69:28 - uh now I get back to here uh what I want
69:33 - here is
69:34 - I'll go to simple HTML
69:37 - um in the
69:39 - this part
69:43 - um
69:45 - I have this two sentences and below this
69:48 - sentence I want an image tag okay
69:51 - Source would be
69:54 - images
69:58 - scare nothing like this what is this
70:02 - Images slash uh let's have the cloud one
70:06 - let's save it
70:07 - we'll have
70:10 - Cloud image okay
70:14 - and
70:17 - similar thing we'll have here as well
70:26 - okay
70:28 - and then below this uh we'll have same
70:33 - mountains and we'll save it and we'll
70:36 - say
70:39 - Mountain image for now okay okay works
70:44 - let's see how it looks
70:47 - uh definitely we are looking for
70:52 - uh what is wrong here exactly
70:58 - um let's just remove the height as well
71:01 - now let's see
71:03 - okay okay
71:08 - and another thing which we can have here
71:11 - is
71:15 - uh sorry yeah here is let's remove the
71:20 - text Line to Center as well okay
71:24 - okay let's save it
71:27 - just give me a minute
71:32 - okay this this looks uh nice okay I mean
71:36 - we have the images not looking nice okay
71:40 - it's looking very houses now you might
71:42 - be wondering why one thing is
71:45 - um which I don't know is bugging to you
71:47 - but it is bugging to me is I have this
71:49 - Cloud here and then I have the sentences
71:51 - but here I have the cloud and
71:53 - adjacent to it is the mountain image
71:56 - so what is these what is this thing
71:58 - exactly what is the difference here
72:01 - okay so the discs uh I mean
72:05 - differences because of the display
72:08 - okay let's now go and try to read the
72:10 - display so display is a CSS property
72:13 - which sits within an element is treated
72:15 - as block or inline
72:17 - okay and the layout is used for okay
72:21 - that is something different but what you
72:23 - should be know is how it is seated block
72:25 - or inline
72:26 - let's just click here block or inline
72:31 - uh
72:34 - okay they don't have it here I'll just
72:36 - tell you what is the blocker and what is
72:38 - an inline
72:44 - okay
72:46 - suppose
72:48 - here I write H1
72:51 - hello world
72:56 - H1 okay
72:59 - now if I
73:02 - have the color as red
73:12 - I mean it is World here and it should be
73:16 - like uh
73:19 - background color
73:25 - here you can see that this I mean the
73:29 - text is here but it is taking the whole
73:31 - this thing
73:33 - right so what is this called
73:37 - so this is basically called a block
73:40 - element which you know blocks the whole
73:43 - uh area
73:44 - not just the text all right
73:48 - similar thing is the
73:50 - paragraph tag as well
73:53 - para have to say
73:55 - and we'll just close it with this
74:00 - okay okay
74:01 - okay
74:03 - then
74:05 - I have the para title well
74:09 - back crown
74:12 - color let's say
74:14 - blue
74:16 - okay
74:18 - so you can see
74:20 - the block elements you know blocking the
74:22 - whole area
74:24 - right
74:26 - so that is one of the displays called
74:29 - block okay
74:31 - another of the display is called uh span
74:34 - ah sorry another display is called
74:36 - inline and example of inline could be a
74:38 - span okay now I'm wondering what is a
74:41 - span so let's just try writing span
74:45 - okay
74:47 - I mean yeah
74:49 - I'll simply write
74:51 - hello
74:53 - world again
74:55 - and I'll just close this fan
74:58 - okay
75:01 - and I'll just have this thing I'll have
75:04 - the background color copied from here
75:07 - only
75:09 - and let's paste it
75:12 - okay
75:13 - great work right I mean you can see that
75:16 - span
75:18 - is on like if we write span and if we
75:21 - try to format it it is not you know uh
75:24 - encapsulating the whole block it is only
75:26 - encapsulating the
75:28 - content written inside it so this type
75:30 - of display is called inline display
75:33 - okay
75:35 - create create
75:37 - now you might be thinking like okay span
75:40 - is working fine then why do we need a
75:43 - block display elements I mean what is
75:46 - the need there
75:47 - so need is there I mean suppose I want
75:50 - the width not
75:52 - to be changed I said
75:55 - 100 pixel
75:58 - right but suppose I want the width here
76:02 - to be
76:03 - 100 pixel
76:06 - it has 100 pixel width right so that is
76:10 - the thing here okay
76:15 - okay everything is working fine
76:17 - everything is cool
76:19 - all is good but
76:21 - the thing which is bugging me is if I
76:24 - want to use the powers of both
76:26 - um block and ni what can I do
76:28 - so CSS gives us the ability to adjust
76:32 - our display okay
76:34 - I just
76:36 - simply write display and I can write
76:41 - inline
76:44 - see
76:46 - cool trick right
76:47 - so this brings you to the third type of
76:50 - display which is
76:53 - in
76:56 - line ok
77:03 - here you can adjust the height
77:08 - let's say 100 pixel
77:11 - see
77:12 - so this gives you the advantage of both
77:15 - the cases all right
77:17 - so this is how you can see that how
77:20 - elements are you know adjusted in our
77:23 - web page using CSS okay
77:26 - the Box model contributes to it the
77:30 - display contributes to it and a few
77:31 - other things which we'll talk about it
77:34 - so I hope you learned something in this
77:36 - video about
77:38 - the display the block display in line
77:41 - display name block display
77:43 - and one more uh very uh
77:48 - what should I say
77:50 - informative
77:53 - tag which is the span tag all right so I
77:56 - guess that was all for this video and in
77:59 - the previous video we learned about
78:01 - um
78:05 - elements of like block elements and
78:07 - inline elements and how we can you know
78:09 - change the position
78:11 - okay
78:13 - and what else uh we talked about the
78:17 - positioning as I mentioned
78:20 - uh all right
78:22 - and
78:25 - did we talk about anything else no that
78:28 - was it okay
78:30 - so in this video we are going to talk
78:31 - more about how you know we position the
78:35 - element exactly okay
78:37 - so but before we do so the first thing
78:40 - we have to realize is that even without
78:42 - CSS
78:44 - HTML element has some positioning by
78:48 - default okay
78:49 - and we have to understand how things you
78:51 - know get positioned by default before we
78:53 - can go and change it to bend the rules
78:55 - okay
78:58 - so the first rule is that content is
79:04 - everything
79:04 - okay
79:06 - suppose here I have uh let's say I have
79:11 - a dip
79:17 - uh hello
79:22 - and here I have a span
79:29 - okay
79:31 - and if I write the div
79:41 - let's see this
79:43 - and
79:45 - I have this one let's see
79:59 - okay
80:01 - take a
80:06 - so we can see that okay in div in Span
80:10 - the content is like this okay it just
80:13 - encapsulates C whole content
80:16 - it's fine that the it has the whole
80:19 - block like this but the height is in
80:22 - accordance to the element only
80:24 - so that's why the first rule is that
80:27 - um content is everything all right
80:30 - the second rule I would say is children
80:32 - sit on parents
80:34 - okay
80:36 - now I'm wondering what I mean by that
80:38 - exactly
80:39 - so suppose I just remove the hello from
80:42 - here
80:44 - okay
80:46 - and here I have
80:50 - height say 100 pixel
80:57 - and let's say
81:00 - with 100 pixel as well for now
81:09 - okay
81:11 - and if I have this pan
81:16 - inside this div so div is a parent and
81:19 - span would be the child
81:22 - all right so you can see that our span
81:27 - or a child sits on the parent
81:30 - right so that is what children said on
81:32 - the parents mean so these are the basic
81:34 - two rules of positioning okay
81:37 - now uh we can also you know set CSS
81:40 - property like
81:43 - other than the positional thing
81:47 - okay
81:49 - uh I mean other than this position or
81:51 - nothing
81:54 - um
81:56 - like the default position thing we can
81:58 - also write a CSS property which is
82:00 - position property in order to position
82:02 - elements on okay
82:04 - so basically there are two position
82:06 - properties static and relative
82:10 - so let's talk about the static so okay
82:13 - we have talked about this article
82:14 - because this default HTML thing
82:18 - I mean positioning of how how how this
82:20 - would be positioned how this would be
82:22 - positioned how this would be positioned
82:23 - is
82:25 - um simple static
82:27 - all right
82:29 - and if I talk about the relative one uh
82:32 - relative positioning is uh basically how
82:36 - uh you would you know
82:38 - a positional element relative to how
82:41 - absolute it was
82:42 - okay
82:44 - I don't know if it made sense to you but
82:47 - let's try something and then
82:50 - we'll be able to I guess I would be able
82:54 - to get it what I'm trying to say here
82:56 - so okay I'm giving you a task make three
83:01 - divs of a square diff of 100 plus 100 by
83:05 - 100 and
83:07 - give them colors of red blue and yellow
83:09 - okay pause the video and do it
83:11 - oh yeah meanwhile I'm gonna do it
83:19 - let's say the
83:23 - class as read
83:28 - okay
83:55 - okay
83:57 - this works right now let's just
84:20 - now let's have the blue one
84:23 - let's do something let's just copy this
84:26 - thing
84:28 - and there's a space here
84:30 - uh change the color to Blue
84:35 - okay
84:37 - and let's uh
84:43 - let's paste it change the color to
84:48 - yellow
84:49 - okay okay cool
84:52 - now suppose I changed the
84:57 - position to
85:00 - um sorry
85:02 - position to relative
85:07 - okay
85:08 - and now I put the top to
85:12 - 20 pixel
85:14 - you see this element
85:17 - be here according to the its static
85:20 - position
85:21 - but
85:22 - since it is a relative position it would
85:25 - you know shift to 20 pixels downward
85:28 - from the top
85:30 - uh whether friends to the absolute
85:32 - position and the one of the major thing
85:36 - is
85:37 - that other elements would still be at
85:40 - their absolute position
85:42 - so if I simply just say 100 pixels
85:47 - good you know come down here and the
85:51 - other element would just you know
85:55 - uh
85:57 - vanish okay so this is all that we have
86:02 - to talk about the positioning absolute
86:04 - answers and how default positioning is
86:06 - done by HTML okay so far in the couple
86:12 - of previous videos we learned about the
86:14 - positioning of elements in our
86:20 - um website right we learned about inline
86:24 - elements we learned about block elements
86:26 - we learned about inline block element
86:29 - we learned about the fixed position and
86:31 - the absolute position and the related
86:35 - position all right
86:36 - so let's do one thing let's go live here
86:40 - and try to see what we have achieved so
86:43 - far okay okay let's remove this red box
86:45 - I don't know why it is still there
86:48 - okay
86:50 - now let's see uh Okay cool so this is
86:55 - what our website uh looks like currently
86:57 - okay
86:59 - now
87:01 - uh one thing which
87:03 - I think we can have it all we can have
87:06 - all these elements towards the center
87:08 - right
87:10 - that is one of the bare minimum
87:12 - so to do that we have text align as I
87:16 - told you which we can have in the body
87:19 - now let's just enter
87:22 - let's see how it looks hmm okay great
87:27 - now one thing I want to tell you is if
87:31 - we inspect it
87:33 - um
87:34 - yeah you can see that
87:37 - all the text
87:38 - uh which are aligned or I mean see it
87:42 - just as a cloud
87:44 - okay let's have it
87:47 - I mean other than the image all the
87:50 - things which are
87:51 - aligned like this
87:55 - so these are basically the uh block
87:59 - element
88:00 - all right like they have the full block
88:03 - like this right
88:06 - the whole inline things right suppose
88:09 - [Music]
88:11 - um
88:12 - I change the width
88:16 - to
88:18 - 10 percent
88:19 - now what will happen
88:21 - see as soon as it gets upload it becomes
88:24 - a block element
88:27 - um
88:27 - yeah so that it becomes a block element
88:30 - the texture line uh don't work on it
88:34 - so what is like what can we do here
88:38 - what we can do here is we can have the
88:40 - margin
88:41 - top would be zero right would be Auto
88:44 - bottom would be zero and left will be
88:47 - orders
88:48 - okay now I have a jacket uh this is how
88:52 - you Center
88:52 - all right so this was all uh about you
88:57 - know centering how we Center an element
89:00 - so these two are the main methods by
89:03 - which we can Center the element all
89:04 - right all right so I'll just
89:07 - [Music]
89:07 - um
89:08 - removed from here for now
89:10 - uh I'll have margin top uh zero let's
89:17 - say
89:18 - back to what we have okay great
89:24 - now another thing which you might be
89:26 - noticing is that this mountain is not
89:29 - aligned in the center because of um
89:33 - This Cloud
89:34 - right
89:36 - um
89:37 - This Cloud basically is like a hindrance
89:39 - right so we have to you know remove this
89:43 - uh cloud from the HTML flow
89:48 - so whenever I remember how we take an
89:52 - element of of the HTML Flow by changing
89:54 - one particular CSS property
89:58 - and yeah that is of course a position
90:00 - property that we are going to change
90:04 - all right
90:07 - um now let's try to
90:11 - see uh what we can change here exactly
90:16 - okay
90:18 - let's do one thing uh this is the cloud
90:23 - um
90:24 - I'll give it a class
90:27 - called
90:29 - bottom Cloud okay
90:34 - uh let's move this is good
90:39 - and I'll say bottom
90:43 - cloud and simply I have the position
90:47 - absolutely
90:56 - why there is
91:01 - no difference here
91:06 - okay okay okay and the third
91:12 - this is our first container so
91:16 - thank you
91:17 - let's have the position
91:22 - whereas related
91:26 - okay
91:28 - and let's have the
91:32 - left of what
91:37 - let me see
91:41 - okay
91:43 - [Music]
91:44 - um
91:47 - 50 pixels
91:48 - okay
91:54 - okay I'm not sure why this thing is not
91:58 - working
92:00 - uh
92:03 - like
92:07 - um
92:08 - let's see let's see let's see
92:12 - there is uh probably sometime which we
92:16 - are missing
92:20 - um what can it be
92:24 - what is that one thing
92:28 - uh which we are nothing
92:32 - let us check the name if it is correct
92:35 - it's bottom cloud
92:38 - okay
92:43 - I mean one of the most any mistakes but
92:48 - okay
92:49 - okay I mean uh
92:53 - it is uh something not one thing you
92:58 - want but it is something
93:00 - so this is because we don't
93:02 - he should not be having what should not
93:06 - be adding
93:08 - uh suppose I just say
93:11 - 10 bucks what difference would it bring
93:13 - let's see
93:16 - okay let's say 300 pixels and
93:22 - okay
93:24 - and left May I'll say 300 pixel
93:29 - okay
93:30 - right
93:34 - so yeah
93:36 - okay let's have it
93:38 - 400 pixels
93:41 - looks pretty nice right so my next
93:44 - challenge is to be
93:45 - to
93:47 - ha let's make it 400 I will
93:51 - let's see how it would look I mean it
93:53 - depends all on you okay not 400 fold it
93:56 - will look nice
93:58 - let's say 350.
94:00 - now let's see let's see
94:03 - okay I mean for me it worked
94:06 - I mean I can have it to 330
94:10 - okay that works for me that was really
94:12 - fine for me
94:13 - okay now I want you I want to give you
94:17 - guys a challenge to move this
94:21 - uh
94:24 - uh I'm Legit forgetting the words right
94:27 - now
94:29 - but yeah let's move this Cloud somewhere
94:33 - here okay
94:34 - let's have some padding over here I
94:36 - would say
94:39 - right uh first container let's have some
94:44 - adding top let's say 100 pixels
94:48 - you see
94:53 - this is
95:09 - another look
95:12 - s unfortunate
95:15 - let's say let's see in this bag let's
95:19 - see why they're not working
95:24 - Cloud I should be obviously adding you
95:27 - know
95:32 - okay
95:34 - well I'm having some baggage
95:39 - okay we'll talk about the batting thing
95:41 - later but
95:42 - um I'm glad like you understood and just
95:45 - try to move this from here to here
95:47 - somewhere
95:49 - hmm
95:53 - so what what what we can do is
95:59 - uh we can have
96:04 - classes
96:05 - [Music]
96:07 - um
96:13 - because
96:15 - there obviously
96:21 - a cloud
96:23 - [Music]
96:24 - um
96:29 - we love the position
96:33 - again as
96:35 - absolute
96:39 - um what we can have more would be
96:43 - let's have top of 50 pixels right
96:51 - and I'll write as
96:56 - okay
96:57 - [Music]
96:59 - let's see how it looks
97:01 - okay
97:03 - where this mountain is a little bit far
97:06 - so we should be having this amount of
97:07 - bit far as well
97:10 - so let's have the left task in pixel as
97:13 - well
97:14 - but okay
97:17 - so now you guys tell me how it looks
97:21 - I mean for me it looks better and I a
97:25 - little bit
97:26 - um what is this
97:28 - uh let's write shown
97:34 - okay it's looking a little bit like this
97:37 - right
97:38 - so okay that's a good start
97:41 - now in the next video we would be trying
97:43 - to change the font here because because
97:46 - of it the positioning
97:48 - changes sometimes it should
97:51 - see all about in the next video hello
97:53 - everyone and I welcome you all to
97:55 - another video of our web development
97:57 - series and in the last video we learned
98:00 - about the what I call the Dark Art of
98:04 - centering
98:05 - elements using CSS all right we did it
98:08 - using two methods and we learned about
98:12 - um
98:14 - what we say uh
98:17 - absolute positioning as well and if I go
98:20 - live
98:22 - this is what my website looks like it
98:24 - looks pretty neat to me at least all
98:26 - right
98:27 - so I mean I'll give that to me that this
98:31 - looks nice
98:34 - okay
98:35 - [Music]
98:39 - uh now what I would be going to talk
98:44 - about is these texts right
98:47 - uh which I already talked about
98:50 - how to I mean uh
98:53 - I am going to
98:55 - talk about them right
99:00 - so
99:02 - yeah
99:04 - let's let's uh just start with that all
99:09 - right
99:12 - great okay now there are basically two
99:15 - font families one is
99:20 - a difference between serif and trans
99:22 - surveys these tiny legs which are
99:24 - present in the serif but are present in
99:26 - these answers
99:27 - okay
99:29 - now let's just try with the example
99:34 - let's say upon family
99:37 - the kind
99:39 - between a lot
99:44 - but uh main are
99:49 - sand setup
99:51 - let's see how it looks
99:53 - okay there's my website okay it's there
99:57 - so we'll see
99:58 - there are no little legs there and there
100:00 - so there is that
100:03 - then we have syrup let's see how it
100:06 - looks
100:07 - see the little legs
100:10 - okay then what else we have we have
100:12 - bonus space right
100:16 - I mean mono spaces
100:19 - uh every letter has you know like equal
100:24 - gap between them
100:26 - then
100:28 - [Applause]
100:30 - let's see
100:32 - I mean it looks a bit terrible right
100:36 - and there is one fantasy as well if I
100:40 - remember correctly okay this looks
100:43 - really bad
100:44 - so these are the basic font families
100:46 - then
100:48 - um we talked about Siri so Sans serif
100:51 - and serif has basically
100:53 - like these upon families so there are
100:55 - definite fonts present in them right
100:59 - so
101:01 - let me show you some things
101:04 - let's say for family I will say
101:09 - uh answer it for now let's see how it
101:13 - looks it looks like you okay
101:15 - then there is
101:18 - wordana
101:22 - which is under the
101:26 - only
101:29 - and it looks little thing like this okay
101:33 - so
101:34 - I okay one more thing is
101:38 - um
101:39 - you are seeing all these things right
101:41 - like you might be wondering okay what
101:44 - the hell is this right
101:46 - uh so suppose guys just type the subject
101:50 - right okay
101:52 - so you might be a little bit uh short to
101:56 - low but I mean the first time when I
101:59 - read about it
102:02 - okay so this is basically uh
102:06 - all these fonts may or may not be
102:09 - present on someone's computer
102:12 - I mean
102:14 - three it's not present on my computer I
102:16 - mean uh this one is present on my
102:18 - computer
102:19 - but
102:20 - there is a high possibility that this
102:23 - might not be present on yours
102:26 - all right then what would happen
102:28 - uh your system would look for this if
102:32 - not it would go for this if not it would
102:34 - look for this and if not transfer refers
102:36 - I mean it is right about there
102:40 - so this is you know a safe place
102:42 - by versus like being very specific and
102:46 - love being very general
102:48 - okay so let's start
102:51 - that is all we have to talk about the
102:54 - whole family
102:55 - now another very pretty thing which I
102:58 - want to talk to you guys is I mean
103:01 - suppose
103:03 - you are a person who is very specific
103:06 - and won't start whatever font you are
103:09 - seeing on your screen should be visible
103:11 - to the other person out there
103:13 - so how to do that
103:16 - okay
103:18 - so I would recommend you to go to false
103:22 - short Google
103:25 - okay
103:31 - google.com let's see
103:44 - no not not this one
104:03 - [Music]
104:07 - exactly
104:11 - over here
104:13 - before
104:17 - um
104:18 - let's see
104:21 - yeah let's make a better alternator
104:24 - let's put a font awesome
104:28 - I don't wanna login right now
104:41 - I'm not able to find it
104:45 - where did it go exactly
105:13 - let's try I mean
105:19 - I'm not sure where they are going wrong
105:22 - let's check
105:24 - okay it has been there what what was I
105:28 - even doing here
105:30 - okay phones.google.com uh you can search
105:33 - it from there
105:35 - um
105:36 - create
105:38 - now something I wanted let's say
105:41 - Merryweather
105:43 - I want this one
105:44 - all right I'll let them play over here
105:48 - uh the regular one

105:55 - right now okay we have something
105:59 - then let's have another one which I like
106:03 - I like it is my personal favorite
106:06 - Sacramento
106:11 - okay
106:13 - I have it already but let's selected for
106:16 - now

108:17 - and for H2 which I don't have currently
108:20 - but I will have it future and it's three
108:24 - I'll have the
108:27 - font family uh not set up
108:31 - um it says pasted and Here Also let's
108:35 - just
108:36 - paste it that's it now if I go to my
108:39 - website
108:42 - okay this looks uh trading design domain
108:46 - right this is the Sacramento one this is
108:49 - the normal marinated right
108:52 - so that was all I had to talk about
108:56 - default all right
108:58 - I hope you like this video you learned a
109:00 - lot through this and I hope you apply
109:02 - this in your project as well so far we
109:05 - have learned a lot of things and
109:08 - and I mean learned basics of CFS then
109:14 - learned Advanced or I would say
109:17 - intermediate CSS as such
109:20 - which included a lot of things
109:22 - okay
109:24 - in centering the difference between
109:28 - their and span
109:30 - and how to style a text okay
109:35 - so in order to you know style our text
109:37 - or to change the text property and go to
109:41 - exclude more ways of
109:43 - styling the text we have to have more
109:47 - content on our website okay
109:50 - if we go live right now
109:53 - this is what our website looks like but
109:56 - we need more content here all right
109:59 - so what to do
110:01 - okay so I have something for you
110:07 - [Music]
110:07 - um
110:10 - yeah okay I have something for you file
110:16 - all right
110:17 - I'll put the description in the uh sorry
110:22 - I haven't delete all the thing in the
110:24 - description and you can download it from
110:25 - there
110:26 - so in one time we'll open it
110:31 - and
110:34 - what we are going to do here
110:37 - left contains something like middle
110:40 - container and okay
110:42 - whatever it contains you got to do we
110:45 - just copy it
110:49 - and Below first container just paste it
110:57 - okay
110:59 - so
111:02 - yeah that is what you have to do and
111:06 - let's just save it
111:09 - and let's see what else it looks like
111:11 - okay
111:14 - now you are wondering what is this right
111:17 - so this is some
111:19 - text which we have here
111:23 - okay
111:24 - here we put in information of ourselves
111:30 - and I
111:32 - will tell you what we'll put but first
111:34 - of all let's try and understand what is
111:37 - like everything written here
111:39 - so in the Metro container what we have
111:42 - we have a profile
111:43 - you can add your image here or any image
111:46 - you want and then we have a Hello and
111:48 - then we have this lorem of SIM card or
111:50 - something something
111:52 - so it is a very I have to create time to
111:55 - tell you what it means
111:58 - let's just write our website
112:03 - and
112:08 - it's taking a bit
112:11 - okay
112:13 - I mean I don't know hydrogen such so
112:16 - much time
112:17 - we'll get through one thing let's go to
112:18 - settings
112:20 - and let's just change the search engine
112:23 - to Google
112:25 - okay and now let's
112:28 - okay it hasn't changed why let's see
112:32 - let's go together and
112:36 - uh
112:52 - okay
112:58 - let's see
113:00 - stored search engine let's go to Google
113:04 - pocket house
113:06 - let's switch type lorem and there you
113:10 - have something
113:12 - close it and close it from here and
113:16 - let's play
113:18 - go ahead and get back and here you can
113:22 - see what is Lauren looks um it is its
113:24 - own tummy text of the predicant type
113:26 - setting industry
113:28 - Okay so
113:31 - what happens basically is when you
113:33 - design a website
113:35 - you know that you would have be having
113:37 - some content over here like you would be
113:40 - having some content over here some
113:41 - content over here some content over here
113:43 - but
113:45 - what exactly you don't know at that time
113:48 - so
113:50 - to happen so you have Tamil content
113:54 - uh over like as a placeholder and later
113:58 - you can you know just modify it
114:01 - uh
114:06 - content from the placeholder all right
114:10 - so
114:13 - that is there all right
114:16 - now let's let's do one thing let's try
114:22 - and add some photos here
114:25 - I mean there is a very famous website
114:28 - called Flat icons where you can get
114:30 - Vector images
114:32 - okay
114:35 - and there are like hundreds of icons
114:41 - just go on
114:43 - V1
114:46 - and you can see like there are hundreds
114:49 - and hundreds of icons present here
114:53 - and you can choose any one of them so
114:55 - suppose I go with
114:58 - Avatar
115:03 - job description Avatar looks fine
115:07 - I go over here what I do
115:10 - um
115:12 - let's pick this photo let's just
115:15 - download the PNG
115:32 - it has downloaded right
115:37 - uh okay go in a folder
115:42 - what I'll do is
115:44 - copy it if you go to our web page
115:48 - in the menu folder we just
115:52 - place it
115:54 - okay
115:56 - looks great
115:58 - now what we'll do we'll come back here
116:01 - in the middle container in this
116:06 - you can have
116:08 - images
116:10 - this is my PNG let's save it let's see
116:12 - how the website looks now
116:15 - okay
116:17 - I mean uh before me needing this big of
116:20 - a picture
116:21 - who will try a little bit
116:25 - let's just say class
116:30 - circles allow okay
116:34 - we go to our style
116:36 - and
116:41 - here I also good
116:45 - okay and
116:48 - I have the model radius of 50 percent
116:57 - all right now if I see the website
117:03 - um
117:04 - let's say
117:06 - represent
117:08 - knowledge
117:11 - okay okay
117:13 - it's right
117:20 - it does not a round figure but not much
117:24 - of a round so let's say
117:27 - okay
117:28 - let's have the
117:31 - width as 100 pixels and
117:36 - five times 100 pixel as well now let's
117:39 - see how it looks
117:42 - hmm looks nice right
117:46 - and instead of this uh you can any other
117:50 - image you can find on the flat icon
117:54 - and you can just simply paste it I mean
117:57 - just copy the image here
118:00 - okay okay
118:02 - similarly uh
118:09 - We Have Skills section as well okay and
118:13 - I have a skills photo here like let's
118:16 - say I go back here
118:20 - skills
118:27 - which I'm liking I'll just simply say
118:29 - coding
118:32 - I mean
118:38 - I'm liking this one
118:46 - okay this is not something I would be
118:49 - needing
118:51 - I have to do something from here so
118:53 - let's say I choose
118:56 - this one looks fine I'll just download
118:58 - it
119:03 - what I'll do I'll go in the folder
119:09 - okay show my folder
119:13 - uh I just cut it and
119:21 - I'll just paste it over here
119:23 - right same and I
119:26 - um
119:28 - close it
119:29 - now here what I have uh
119:35 - here I have the four five images
119:40 - file extension
119:41 - and let me close
119:45 - answer circles I'll save it
119:47 - now let's see what it looks like
119:50 - I mean it looks amazing to me at least
119:53 - we have some other picture over here
119:55 - like whatever you want but for now
119:59 - I have the same one okay
120:03 - and
120:09 - great
120:11 - now
120:12 - okay looks amazing
120:15 - and then the
120:20 - last container
120:22 - we have contact me phone type
120:25 - where you can mail to wherever you want
120:30 - let me just type in my mail ID
120:41 - okay
120:43 - then in the bottom container you can
120:45 - have different links
120:47 - and here you can have a name and surname
120:49 - as a copyright name
120:51 - that is put in my name
120:57 - now if I go back to my website this is
120:59 - what we have got so far I mean we can
121:01 - increase
121:03 - a bit over here
121:06 - let's say
121:08 - 200
121:11 - save it
121:12 - let's say we create
121:15 - perfect looks amazing right
121:18 - now this is me so I would put my photo
121:20 - over here you can have a photo here you
121:22 - can give a small introduction over here
121:24 - for now I have just determi text because
121:26 - I'm just showing it to you right
121:29 - and again same text over here something
121:32 - something here
121:35 - and get in touch something something
121:37 - then contact the mail
121:41 - your
121:43 - social profiles uh URL you can have
121:48 - in the copyright photo so
121:51 - we have got a lot of content over asking
121:53 - now which read format or change the
121:57 - properties
121:58 - in the upcoming video
122:00 - and in the previous video we
122:03 - copy the code from the sub code file
122:06 - which I
122:08 - I told you in the previous video
122:12 - okay now if I click on go live
122:18 - uh we can see that we have got something
122:23 - here
122:26 - we have got the
122:30 - content now we can try and talk about
122:34 - them
122:35 - all right
122:36 - now one thing I want to talk about you
122:39 - guys is on science okay suppose I want
122:42 - this thing to be the created suppose
122:48 - okay
122:51 - I mean I want it to be more greater than
122:54 - everything like move it around the H1
122:56 - standard size
122:58 - so that
123:00 - like really
123:03 - ultimate heading thing all right so what
123:05 - what that what will do what we'll do is
123:08 - we'll go here
123:10 - in this one I am going to have
123:14 - font size
123:16 - 90 pixel
123:21 - wasn't up let's say 50 pixels
123:27 - great it looks a lot bigger and
123:30 - everything
123:32 - uh
123:37 - I say zero only press V
123:41 - and I click ok so it looks a lot nicer
123:45 - right
123:47 - create
123:48 - but
123:49 - uh we have like mentioned it in pixel
123:53 - but there is one another
123:57 - um any Dimension em
124:00 - before talking about em let us see like
124:03 - what else like why don't means pixel
124:08 - suppose I go to settings
124:11 - I go to appearance and in the font size
124:14 - which is the medium which is recommended
124:15 - I click on large
124:18 - now if I come here
124:22 - uh you notice okay I'll get through it
124:26 - very large
124:29 - so one thing you might have noticed is
124:32 - size of this text has not been changed
124:35 - by size of this text
124:47 - why is that because
124:49 - then we declare a font size and pixel we
124:54 - have like fixed that thing okay like
124:56 - that is a static value
124:58 - to have it in a dynamic we use PM okay
125:03 - so let me tell you what is VM first so
125:08 - El
125:19 - okay
125:21 - here is like
125:26 - um sound
125:28 - of M so when uh previous
125:33 - uh times
125:36 - 1 em was equal to
125:39 - uth and
125:41 - size
125:44 - of L
125:46 - okay
125:47 - but in the modern days
125:50 - one
125:52 - pm is equal to 16 pixel okay
125:59 - now if I change this part
126:03 - because I wanted to be
126:06 - an email ID password 90 by 16.
126:09 - which would come roughly to
126:13 - 5.625 am
126:17 - okay
126:20 - go back same size okay create everything
126:23 - looks good
126:25 - now another property I want to talk
126:28 - about
126:29 - um
126:31 - EMS
126:35 - um if suppose I have one side here but
126:37 - one size is a basically you know derived
126:39 - value suppose here
126:42 - in the body I have a font size of
126:45 - 2 am
126:49 - and there are so h1nl inside body so
126:53 - it's one parent is body right so if I
126:56 - have font size in the body and if I have
126:59 - a font size in H1
127:01 - this font size would become equal to
127:05 - 5.625 plus just two okay so if I go here
127:09 - you can see okay it looks very very
127:11 - right
127:13 - if I have only same side what I'll do
127:15 - I'll do 3.65
127:18 - oh okay
127:21 - but there are not a very you know like
127:23 - this is a small code so you can see uh
127:26 - check whose parents have got what size
127:28 - but in big codes it is very hard to
127:31 - debug this thing
127:34 - so in order to have this value to be on
127:36 - its own and not to be derived
127:39 - we use something called
127:42 - REM okay R stands for root
127:46 - so if I put this value
127:53 - [Music]
128:00 - so I guess we talked about the font size
128:03 - here
128:05 - and this was one of the most uh
128:09 - important and crucial parts we should be
128:11 - known between difference between pixel
128:13 - Emi and Ariens
128:14 - all right so okay
128:17 - and so far
128:20 - um let's look at the website which
128:22 - we have created
128:25 - something like this where
128:28 - it looks nice right
128:31 - oh great okay something
128:35 - um
128:38 - I want to have here is in the body let's
128:43 - remove this
128:44 - it's looking too big but that right now
128:48 - if I go here
128:49 - yeah
128:50 - it looks much smaller now
128:53 - better okay great now I would like to in
128:58 - this video uh try and
129:03 - um
129:04 - have a skills and some nice way okay I
129:07 - mean to format it in a nice frame
129:11 - so for formatting uh one thing I would
129:15 - like to have
129:17 - let's have the inspect
129:22 - okay uh Lindy class row you can see that
129:27 - we have two divs for two different
129:30 - foreign
129:45 - I wanted to change the width to 50 okay
129:48 - this is your first challenge for the
129:50 - video and try it
129:52 - okay now if I talk about if I want to
129:56 - drive what I will do is I will go on
129:58 - scale through
130:00 - make sure it matches the name here
130:04 - okay
130:06 - and here you can have with us
130:12 - 50 save it and see how it looks okay
130:19 - enough inspect
130:22 - folder you can see
130:24 - it has a fifty percent and this fifty
130:26 - percent is left
130:28 - great now another thing which I want is
130:32 - to
130:34 - send but enter these shapes in the
130:36 - middle
130:38 - for that we learned about the margin
130:45 - let's say Auto let's save it
130:49 - and it is in the margin I mean at a
130:51 - sensory Center
130:53 - but I'm not liking this part all this
130:56 - space I need to have some spacing so
131:00 - 1200 pixel margin
131:03 - on top and bottom and leave the left and
131:06 - right to uh
131:08 - Auto
131:10 - so pause the video and try it so if I
131:14 - have to do it what I'll do I'll write
131:16 - 100 pixel
131:18 - and if I go clockwise it would be right
131:21 - so Auto and then again bottom would be
131:26 - 100 pixel and then again that model
131:28 - would be Auto if I save
131:31 - how would it look
131:33 - hmm I mean I got the margin here and
131:36 - here so it looks pretty nice
131:38 - now another thing uh which I want from
131:41 - you guys is to have this uh text in the
131:45 - left part not in the center part
131:48 - so here we have the texture line of
131:50 - Center but here I want to have the text
131:52 - aligners left
131:54 - for that you know you can simply write
131:56 - text line left and what it will do it
131:59 - would override their text line
132:03 - just here so if I look at it
132:08 - looks something like this okay great
132:12 - now now what else
132:15 - what else is and you can see that
132:18 - there's no much space here right
132:21 - so what to do on this thing like I want
132:24 - to have some space here
132:27 - what we can have here is
132:31 - we can have uh line height
132:37 - okay you can see the difference see
132:39 - there is some like line height
132:42 - difference and it looks uh
132:44 - pretty better than before okay
132:51 - and then what else okay one thing I
132:53 - didn't tell you in the previous video
132:54 - you can use this stickers I'll show you
132:57 - the lots of they can be used here
133:01 - go to Jiffy or click on be animated
133:05 - and here you can write code
133:09 - okay
133:11 - uh
133:13 - and click on the stickers part
133:17 - let's see what stickers we can get from
133:21 - here
133:25 - fight is a bit slow
133:33 - [Music]
133:40 - if I click on scales let's see what it
133:44 - shows me
133:48 - [Music]
133:51 - okay
133:54 - I don't know why I got the images are
133:57 - not
134:00 - okay
134:02 - okay
134:04 - but
134:07 - um okay there's a lot of thing at all
134:10 - I don't know what the problem is
134:17 - okay we'll see it in see it at the end
134:20 - of the video we'll see if this you guys
134:22 - get loaded we'll try and inculcate it
134:24 - otherwise we will go with this image
134:26 - cool so far we have formatted our skills
134:31 - set a bit
134:32 - but
134:34 - I want to do one time which would look
134:37 - totally cool
134:39 - but it is not right now which is I want
134:43 - to wrap these texts
134:46 - around here okay and then I should be
134:50 - here and this text should wrap it or
134:52 - somewhere around here
134:54 - how to achieve that
134:57 - so for that let me just reduce it to
135:03 - say 25 percent
135:07 - okay and Here Also let's do 25 percent
135:19 - I don't know
135:22 - I mean obviously we cannot individ but
135:24 - let's see okay looks nice
135:28 - so for that what we do is we learn about
135:34 - um
135:36 - new ones are called float okay
135:39 - just go float CSS
135:42 - property
135:44 - and see what it is exactly
135:47 - so close property specifies whether an
135:49 - element should float left right or not
135:52 - at all
135:54 - all right so absolutely positioned
135:56 - elements ignore the flow property so
135:58 - rather than seeing any running the
136:02 - theory let's go for the
136:04 - uh learning it in Practical all right
136:07 - float
136:12 - and I feel like
136:13 - and if I save it
136:18 - so you float today
136:33 - okay
136:35 - that's why we had a problem
136:37 - foreign
136:54 - so that's why
136:58 - we are facing that problem let's move
137:00 - the plot for now
137:03 - now see
137:05 - it's back okay
137:08 - okay uh pretty much not what we need
137:13 - or getting the correct stickers here I
137:16 - would say
137:17 - let's just say I'm coding it we'll let
137:20 - it open it from we come back here what
137:23 - we will do we will have some
137:27 - other class here let's say
137:31 - kill
137:33 - image
137:35 - and here also I'm going to have 12.
137:40 - image okay
137:43 - and if I go here what I'll do I'll
137:47 - kill
137:49 - image okay
137:51 - I have these two things
137:58 - and then I am going to half note left
138:01 - okay
138:04 - only through one thing I'll have skill
138:07 - image one and climate I'll tell you why
138:11 - I am doing this
138:13 - let's save it let's see
138:16 - so this is what I was talking about see
138:19 - if all texts are
138:22 - wrapping this
138:25 - text around okay but I see that there's
138:28 - no Gap here so how to have a gap here
138:32 - so what we can do we can simply have
138:36 - uh margin
138:39 - from the left of 100 pixel
138:44 - so cannot from left from right
138:56 - great now see
139:00 - looks nice right
139:03 - Now
139:05 - new challenge for you would be to have
139:08 - this part
139:10 - to something slowly like this but this
139:12 - image should come here and the text
139:13 - would be somewhere here
139:16 - did we get an image okay
139:18 - cool so can you do that for me try it
139:22 - so what you can do is you can do skill
139:25 - image
139:28 - to
139:29 - you can have these things
139:33 - okay and in the float you can have
139:38 - right
139:40 - okay and margin
139:43 - then from the right should be
139:47 - 50 pixel now let's see
139:51 - great
139:52 - okay how awesome does this look right
139:54 - the MySQL section is looking something
139:57 - like this and another parts coming here
140:00 - like two years only looks really great
140:03 - right
140:04 - and one more thing which we can have and
140:07 - we can have this color on all the parts
140:10 - that would look great
140:13 - right okay we got something how about
140:16 - this
140:19 - suppose I just copied it I just
140:22 - came here
140:25 - and from here if I please set and let me
140:29 - save it
140:30 - let's see did we get it
140:34 - create
140:36 - a little bit look wonderful right
140:39 - you can have some other image on the
140:41 - second part as well
140:43 - uh let's say what's I would say
140:46 - I mean this looks nice
140:48 - let's just copy this
140:52 - uh don't tell me
140:55 - we have to wait again but okay we can
140:58 - wait and by the end of this lecture
141:01 - I mean two or three minutes and we can
141:03 - get these signals so let's wait for that
141:06 - time
141:07 - but okay we want to have this color here
141:11 - so what we'll do we'll check watercolor
141:14 - was
141:17 - because
141:20 - you simply copy it and put it in the
141:23 - background
141:26 - looks nice to me at least
141:30 - and I hope you guys also like it great
141:35 - um
141:39 - so many images but yeah
141:42 - we're gonna add this one
141:44 - and if I
141:50 - try to paste it
141:52 - here
141:54 - it would look good
142:01 - I mean it's not looking very nice over
142:04 - here right
142:07 - so let's
142:09 - move that image let's have some other
142:12 - image
142:18 - so we can do one thing you can have the
142:21 - Border radius I have let's say 60
142:23 - percent
142:25 - and let's see what time that see it now
142:28 - yeah looking much better okay so so far
142:32 - I mean I'm liking what have done
142:36 - and we learned about the float and
142:40 - we learned about you know these stickers
142:43 - which we can use
142:45 - great we learned about this property as
142:48 - well
142:48 - so yeah I mean
142:51 - that move it
142:55 - which I wanted you guys to know here
143:00 - all right and one thing which
143:05 - we can have this
143:08 - between the
143:10 - here we can have
143:13 - HR tag okay
143:17 - great
143:19 - and
143:27 - okay I'm not getting
143:28 - [Music]
143:32 - okay let's see what HR thickness how we
143:36 - can have HR
143:38 - okay see it says
143:42 - move we check uh
143:46 - then
143:54 - height add one pixel let's say
143:59 - char
144:06 - and stream it let's see
144:10 - okay nothing much happened
144:18 - let's try and just copy this part let's
144:21 - see how it would look
144:25 - foreign
144:44 - and so far we have created our project
144:48 - all right let's click on go live and see
144:50 - what we have created so far
144:52 - so
144:55 - okay great
144:56 - this is what it looks like right nice
145:01 - now I want to uh you know I have planned
145:06 - something that this video and next video
145:10 - most probably
145:11 - uh we'll have you know I'll uh walk you
145:15 - uh through this like site or through
145:19 - some styling which I'm going to do
145:21 - and I would highly recommend you to you
145:24 - know follow me along this these two
145:26 - videos
145:27 - we are talking about minute minute
145:29 - changes which you are going to put on
145:31 - our site
145:33 - to look at more presentable than it is
145:36 - right now
145:37 - all right
145:39 - so yeah let's let's try and do this
145:46 - great
145:48 - cool
145:50 - now uh
145:53 - before I talk about anything
145:56 - um what I want is
145:59 - right now I want your text color to be a
146:04 - little grayish okay
146:06 - I mean you can see the text color it is
146:08 - little black but if it is a little
146:10 - grayish that would look cool right
146:12 - so the code for that would be 4 0
146:15 - um
146:17 - 514 e
146:19 - okay
146:20 - I save it I go and I see yeah I mean
146:25 - it's not much of a change but it looks
146:28 - nice
146:29 - all right
146:30 - and then on H1 and H2 I want a little
146:34 - different color
146:36 - you can have any color of your choice
146:38 - but what I'm thinking is a little of
146:41 - aqua
146:43 - okay
146:47 - create and on H2 I am thinking of having
146:50 - the same
146:54 - okay on H3 as well
147:04 - great
147:05 - now if I go back
147:08 - looks nice right
147:12 - um
147:13 - great
147:15 - uh what else we can have here is
147:24 - okay
147:25 - now
147:28 - um
147:29 - we got the height and everything
147:36 - now what I want is to have a gap between
147:40 - these two I mean this cap and you know
147:44 - this Gap there's no gap between you know
147:46 - bottom container and
147:48 - middle container middle container and
147:50 - top container so for the Gap I am going
147:52 - to go on the
147:55 - uh what have I named it here
147:58 - middle container right
148:00 - so I don't think so I have any middle
148:02 - container here so I'll just have
148:07 - one metal container
148:09 - let me just check your spelling okay
148:11 - that's fine
148:14 - okay let's try and try the metal
148:17 - container
148:19 - we'll go for margin we want top margin
148:22 - to be hundred pixel we don't want any
148:24 - left margin so it would be Auto
148:26 - bottom margin would be 100 pixels and
148:28 - then again Auto
148:30 - great now if we go back hmm looks nice
148:35 - right
148:36 - now one more thing I want is uh
148:42 - here we have
148:44 - class of circuits if I check what is
148:48 - circles
148:50 - width is fine but I want to change the
148:53 - height as well
148:54 - let's say net pixel
148:58 - okay loaded Holland pixel
149:02 - let's remove this
149:03 - let's have beta 100 pixel
149:07 - height 100 pixels now let's go and see
149:10 - okay it looks a bit small
149:13 - so let's make it 200 now we go check
149:17 - perfect
149:19 - great
149:21 - looking nice right
149:29 - now another thing which I want
149:33 - would be
149:36 - I mean c
149:38 - this row die it is a single long line it
149:41 - is not looking nice at least not to me
149:45 - so what I am thinking of doing here is
149:48 - like I'll give it a class
149:51 - I'll say intro I save it and here
149:56 - I'll have a intro
150:00 - and here I am going to have width as
150:04 - let's say 40 percent
150:07 - let's save it let's see
150:09 - okay looks looks better but we want to
150:14 - be on Center so here we'll have the
150:16 - margins as Auto
150:19 - and yeah this is how it looks it's nice
150:24 - agreed
150:26 - great great great great
150:30 - uh what else we can have here is
150:47 - okay
150:53 - no no no no no what else we can have on
150:58 - our website
150:59 - to
151:00 - make it look
151:02 - better
151:05 - like can you think okay we can change
151:08 - this this long line doesn't look nice
151:11 - so for this thing we are going to try
151:13 - something
151:15 - okay there's a standard code so just
151:20 - uh we not remember it but try to
151:23 - understand it okay
151:24 - you're going to have dotted
151:27 - we are going to have thickness as X
151:30 - pixel
151:32 - and here we have color which would be
151:35 - Gray
151:37 - would look like and let's save it
151:41 - Drago that looks something like this it
151:44 - looks not very nice but it is what it is
151:47 - now the Border bottom
151:49 - has to be zero because we want only
151:51 - single line or none
151:55 - okay I go
151:58 - a single line
151:59 - I don't want so many dots
152:03 - so I can have with uh like four percent
152:08 - that would work
152:12 - okay looks nice
152:15 - and
152:18 - margin here should be
152:22 - 100 pixel from the top
152:25 - 0 pixel
152:28 - Auto from the left
152:31 - 100 pixel from the bottom
152:35 - and auto from the right let's save it
152:38 - let's see
152:39 - okay
152:42 - looks nice right
152:44 - yes great work great work
152:47 - now okay I'll give you a challenge like
152:52 - this has been made
152:55 - I want you guys
152:57 - do it exactly what we did here okay
153:01 - so
153:02 - uh I would like
153:06 - um suggest you guys
153:08 - to
153:10 - try this thing
153:12 - okay
153:14 - and this would look nice
153:19 - so try it
153:22 - okay
153:24 - if I go here I check in the bottom
153:29 - what is there
153:32 - as such no class has been assigned to it
153:35 - so we'll assign a class
153:37 - bottom
153:45 - okay
153:50 - and
153:53 - you are going to have Dot
153:55 - bottom
153:57 - this is what I have written
154:00 - okay great
154:03 - now
154:05 - this was the code I copy it and paste it
154:09 - here save it
154:10 - if I go back
154:16 - looks nice right
154:18 - but it doesn't have you know uh
154:22 - I mean because margin is auto that's why
154:25 - I guess
154:26 - the problem is so let's do one thing
154:30 - let's have Auto
154:33 - 100 pixel Auto
154:36 - and let's see it now
154:39 - okay
154:42 - okay let's have it at 60
154:48 - hmm
154:49 - let's have it as 40.
155:00 - 40 pixel sorry
155:03 - yeah looking great
155:05 - right
155:07 - now the last thing I want you guys to
155:10 - understand in this video is
155:13 - you have to change this contact me
155:14 - button okay for that we have something
155:18 - CSS
155:20 - button generator
155:23 - okay if you go to this website you can
155:26 - have your button as your own
155:28 - okay
155:29 - now here I want not click me but I want
155:33 - contactly
155:35 - font is five
155:38 - or we can have this font you can choose
155:40 - your own color
155:45 - I mean for me this would look nice
155:50 - it hasn't changed
156:06 - okay font size fine
156:09 - box everything's fine border I would
156:12 - like to change it to
156:14 - 8 so that it gets a square shape all
156:18 - right
156:19 - and
156:21 - background
156:22 - [Music]
156:27 - this works fine
156:30 - however I don't and so we need anything
156:33 - in the hover part
156:35 - okay
156:37 - so let's
156:39 - just copy this whole code from here
156:43 - okay and then we are going to paste it
156:47 - here
156:48 - simply just paste it
156:51 - now you go to HTML and you see your
156:56 - I mean it has button only
156:58 - so if you go to a website now I'll see
157:01 - button okay great
157:04 - looks nice right
157:06 - now you can change the color here on
157:08 - your own
157:09 - pose
157:11 - I want to have the same color which we
157:14 - are having here
157:16 - let's just copy it and
157:20 - let's just try and paste it
157:30 - okay
157:33 - I mean color is different I don't think
157:36 - we can find it but 3.
157:39 - color is different right
157:41 - so yeah so I mean we have I mean we did
157:46 - a lot of things in this video
157:48 - okay we had some
157:50 - hide I mean patterns we have this
157:54 - cute little dots
157:58 - we made this contact me button we
158:01 - centered the textures like this and
158:04 - everything so yeah everything looks cool
158:06 - so I guess that was all for this video
158:09 - at least and in this and if you remember
158:12 - in the previous video we styled our
158:14 - website
158:21 - let's see
158:22 - okay uh my bad let's just close this
158:26 - just go back here don't show again
158:30 - now let's play
158:33 - okay
158:36 - we added these underlines
158:40 - and what else
158:42 - we added this button okay great now one
158:45 - thing which I did was I changed the
158:49 - color
158:50 - of our lower part two simple white and
158:54 - this part of key one which was there
158:57 - previously okay
158:59 - so in this video all we are going to do
159:02 - is we are going to talk about the footer
159:04 - part
159:05 - in order
159:08 - to put a part one thing
159:11 - uh that is concerning me here practice
159:14 - but it looks little out of place right
159:17 - because of the font so what can we do
159:21 - simply we can do one thing
159:24 - um style.css
159:34 - so we'll just copy this and
159:39 - you know we are just going to have to
159:40 - paste it you will save it on now but it
159:43 - looks pretty nice
159:47 - no uh if we have to format the footer
159:51 - part so it's class with bottom retainer
159:56 - so we have bottom container
160:00 - and here I'm going to have my
160:05 - um
160:06 - background color uh six
160:10 - um sorry
160:12 - call background color
160:17 - here uh background colors
160:22 - yeah nice
160:25 - the same color which we are using for
160:27 - the font
160:30 - um let me show you yeah yeah
160:33 - it looks something like this nice oh one
160:37 - thing you must just start you can see
160:40 - this thing we have some Gap why is that
160:43 - already told you that
160:46 - web pages by themselves sign Auto
160:51 - margins
160:52 - so how to cover that exactly
160:57 - we can cover them with
161:00 - padding
161:02 - so let's have our top adding a 50 pixel
161:05 - okay
161:08 - um
161:11 - left adding a zero bottom parting is 20.
161:16 - uh
161:18 - and left adding and see
161:21 - next thing and we'll see looks nice
161:26 - right so it is there
161:30 - now another thing which I want to change
161:32 - is these
161:33 - um
161:36 - anger tags
161:38 - so what we're going to do is for the
161:40 - anchor tags
161:43 - let me open
161:45 - yeah okay so for the anchor tags what we
161:48 - can do here we can first of all change
161:50 - the color of the text
161:53 - to let's say one one
161:59 - okay now if you go back
162:02 - you can see it looks nice you mean it is
162:05 - a little
162:06 - same to the color but I actually prefer
162:09 - this when using the links all right
162:12 - now you can see that we have these
162:15 - underlines
162:16 - which I don't want so these underlines
162:18 - are as you know
162:20 - already provided by uh HTML for the
162:24 - angle tags to remove that we can
162:29 - use the text decoration
162:33 - so in this text decoration of let's say
162:40 - okay
162:41 - great now uh there is no gap between
162:44 - them so let's put some gap between them
162:49 - for Gap you know we have to put the
162:51 - margin let's have the top margin of
162:53 - Centerview uh right marginal 20 pixel
162:58 - left marginalized
163:01 - if I go back and look
163:03 - yeah looks looks better rate
163:09 - the only thing left is to have the phone
163:11 - family
163:13 - we are going to have this one family
163:15 - only
163:17 - and we'll save it
163:22 - now
163:24 - sorry yeah okay looks pretty nice right
163:28 - the only thing which is left is I don't
163:31 - I mean if we user comes from the website
163:33 - he won't be able to recognize that what
163:35 - is this
163:38 - when I hover over it I want something
163:41 - different so for that we already know
163:43 - something which is pseudo class
163:46 - right I hope you remember guys you can
163:49 - just scoop over and watch the videos so
163:52 - we
163:55 - have this thing over we
163:58 - have our order I want the color to be
164:01 - more a bit White
164:03 - Shadow white which is e e f
164:07 - 6 F6
164:10 - okay now
164:13 - you go and look and you see
164:16 - looks great all right I mean
164:20 - already know what to do right
164:24 - great now the amazing item left is
164:28 - to have the copyright part
164:33 - so for that let's just
164:37 - see if we have something okay we don't
164:40 - have any
164:42 - class so let's add a
164:46 - class here
164:48 - let's name as
164:50 - copyright
164:53 - okay and let's
164:59 - our copyright
165:02 - fine okay
165:05 - now first of all I want the color so we
165:08 - can have the same color
165:11 - uh the white one looks pretty neat
165:16 - looks nice right
165:19 - now I want this text to be reduced the
165:23 - contrast will be reduced
165:25 - it's a 0.6 75 RM
165:32 - okay
165:34 - three fourth of 16 pixels
165:37 - it is right so it looks nice but small
165:41 - and I wanted to be at the bottom so to
165:44 - get it at the bottom
165:46 - I have to have padding
165:51 - so
165:53 - adding will be what
165:57 - we go bottom container the bottom
166:00 - padding is 20 pixels
166:02 - foreign
166:16 - and it looks nice right
166:24 - so well right here that was on which we
166:28 - could do this website
166:30 - it looks pretty nice to me we have a
166:33 - nice you know starting page

167:51 - so from the next video we will talk
167:53 - about bootstrap what is bootstrap and
167:55 - how we would inculcate it in our files
167:58 - all right
167:59 - so thank you for watching this video and
168:03 - see you later

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and we have leveled up all right so we have you know learned uh respectable amount of HTML like you would be required to make any um you know representable form of web page uh you would be able to do it you know we talked about forms and we talked about tables we talked about lists we talk about you know basic HTML boilerplates and everything all right and there are other things which I don't feel necessary but if you want you who can look for it I mean iframe is there and some other stuff you can look that on your own all right so from this video we would be starting uh CSS all right so what does CSS stands for CSS stands for cascading styling sheet hold it just put it here let's create okay cool now what are the reasons yeah CSS is used why can't we just you know use HTML for the selling because see HTML stylings if you talk about um it is not preferred all right because see because of HTML styling the alignment gets all messed up all right let me write alignment all right and sometimes it does not produce the correct result as well okay it messes the layout now let's just go quickly and check CSS h mdn box all right so CSS cascading style sheets so it is you know basically a stat sheet language used to describe the presentation of markup languages so markup languages include HTML or XML okay and then all other things as well all right so currently uh that is all the theory you should be knowing about CSS okay and let's do one thing let's go here and let's see how do we add our you know CSS so let's do one thing let's write style dot CSS and how do we basically link it with our HTML so here you just write link CSS okay actually Ariel is basically relationship which is style sheet almost all right then there is uh hyper reference which is this styles.css okay cool now let's just go to style.css and how do we basically style the things so just just you know let's go uh and see what the web page look like okay this look like this cool now what if I have to add the background uh here what I'll do I'll simply write background color CSS mdn all right I'll just go here I just go here I just check it how we do it so we use the background color like this okay so let us sit there all right now what we do exactly is C suppose I have to uh modify the whole area there right so I'll be using a tag there right okay and how do we like exactly use the um attacking and everything oh let's see I go here see this Tiger's body I'll simply say body and I'll open this thing and I'll write here background color and I got a very nice background color so I'll just write the background color code it's e a f and then I'll write 6 F6 all right I receive it go here see background color has again it is looking kind of pretty all right like at least two minutes kind of looking fitty to me all right so that is one thing then you can you know the changes in the H1 as well okay let's do one thing let's add this one and let's see how do we know add color in the text I'll just simply say X color CSS mdn we'll go here we'll see how it works so it's just simply color the color property set the foreground color value of an element text and text decoration set the current color value okay so we'll just come here we'll simply write color and again I got a very nice color which is 6X p f p f okay it's the same rate let's see how it works see a form is already looking kinda pretty right I mean at least for me okay so yeah that is one thing then we can have another thing here as called line there it is simply say Center and see okay this should have been word I mean a line okay I don't know okay let's just simply say align text CSS mdn okay it's texture line so here we just simply write text align Center let's save it let's go let's see see I mean kind of looking very nice right so cool so there's one thing you should be able to very good at Google search for CSS I mean because uh these properties are like in thousands all right so you won't be able to you know learn about every one of them but you should be able to know like what you want to do like I know about here that I want to align my text somewhere so just simply write align text CSS right that's what you have to do there so I guess that was it for the introductory video of CSS uh so let's just quickly review what we talked about here we talked about CSS its reform why don't we use HTML styling over CSS then we learned about linking CSS style sheet to our HTML then how basically we style everything we use the tag like body tag I use it um modified body the H1 tag at modified action like that okay in this video we are going to look at CSS syntax or you can say anatomy of CSS okay so in the previous video we learned about how you know you can add CSS file inside your HTML file so just to give you a quick recap I'm just going I'm just going to put one index dot h tml here I'm going to add okay something is wrong foreign okay I named it index.css so let's just change it to index.css okay now I'll show you how you know CSS syntax is written I mean I did show you in the previous one but let's see how like what is the breakage of it so you can say the breakage of system taxes it is something like selector okay and then inside of it um there is property and then there is um selection let's see okay and these are all in the curly brackets now see this selector this is basically oh like who we need to change okay property is what that means okay we know what like who we need to change exactly or you can say which but what inside that selector we need to change so that is defined by property what and this tells us how much like what you want to change like if you want to you know give it a width how much width you want to like make it bold how much bold that is told by the selection what is sold by the property and who is stored by the selector now let's try and implement this a bit let's see how it works here I'm going to have an H1 here I'm going to say in the text and then I'm going to have a p where I'm going to say paragraph text I'll go to my index here I'll select who or what I want to change I want to change H1 okay inside action what I want to change I'll just say let's say color how much or what should be the color here yeah let's say aqua I'll save it I automate it and I'll just click on goli okay why haven't it been changed it is index.chers and here it is CSS let's do one thing let's say it style.css and here we will use our rename it let's suppose it works okay that is weird Y is set not working foreign elements like H1 element of P element you want to you know change we just directly write them as I told you in the previous video but if you like suppose add something called a class here of H1 let's say then if you want to you know uh modify this specific class only then you put dot okay it's not relevant right now but just you know telling you I mean this class would come in the future video so don't you know worry about it but anyways we see you know what we change like movie change what inside that we change and by how much we change or what is that we change okay nice similarly you can have the paragraph tag as well let's see okay and it looks nice let's see you can increase the font size let's see uh learn two great so this was you know basically the anatomy of cases syntax selector property selection to what how much okay so in the previous video we learned about the anatomy of CSS right then we talked about yeah um the prop the values the selectors and everything and we looked at how website looks let's just Collide here okay my bad HTML okay let's close that and it's Collide now okay so this is what it looks like all right now um in the previous video we came up with a with the problem right so uh what I wanted was to change the colors of these two decks right I wanted this to be in black and I wanted this to be an uh but when I use the P here so both of these would get uh the same color so here the confusion arises right what to do now so since till now we have talked about uh selectors which are just tags like etch on tag P tag but now we are going to look at more CSS selectors schools and you can see spot assist selectors you already know but let's read it again so uh basically selects the HTM element you understand all right now there are different type of CSS selectors okay uh you can divide the CSS selectors into five category so there are simple selectors then there are combinators pseudo class you do elements and attributes okay so if you go to combinator selectors you can see a combinator something that explains a relationship between these characters so this would be I guess uh later too much for you okay so right now we are not going to talk about the combination one we'll talk at about any further coming videos but uh till then uh let's just talk about the simple selectors about in the simple selector we have only used the tag name okay so simple CSS selectors it contains ID and class okay so ID is used by a hashtag sign and class is used by a DOT okay we'll talk about how we'll do that okay and then there is a universal selected as well okay and the letters we talked about and yeah okay okay that is cool that is good right so let's just head back to our virtual Studio code and let's learn what we just ready so here we'll just write um ID okay and let's just name it and here we have a class which would be named black for now yeah okay now here what uh we'll do we'll comment this so I hope you know what a comment is so comment is basically a part of the code which is basically not executed or compiled so it is understood by the compiler that this is just for the documentation purposes and we don't need to compile this okay so it tells you by forward slash star and then you can have this chart again and forward slash okay okay that looks well oh okay let's talk about the universal directors the open Universal selector right now I'll just save it okay there is another warning okay now here I'll simply write uh font family on family is basically used for changing the font style so let's suppose with this right now okay let's just save it okay only one okay okay okay okay okay okay um okay you're the same thing here but oh is it not working let's go here outside property okay that is in one on red oh let's just go back here we have saved it let's just go here okay let's just observe this now we'll go back here again and other than this what you can have equal that's right let's see where let's go back here uh let's have this okay okay it is still not changing I am still not sure why is that happening let's just go to the Bluetooth okay okay let's try it for ourselves um you can see that there are different ones why are we not having that thing behind anything okay let's try two one two one thing it is copy it from here relationship okay it's still not working let's just go to selected back again Universal selector is like this only okay let's just do one thing let's just try to put the color here for now and let's just say I'm not black let's say so let's see where let's just go here in this part from here let's go okay this thing is working okay hmm or family hmm let's just try the font I'm leaving again or let's just support Target right now okay I just don't want to miss you don't see that it always you can check the phone from everything on your own on your own system Maybe uh we'll see what it is all right so okay but never mind uh we're talking about friends so let's have one thing here uh let's have the class which was back okay and here we have the color as black okay let's save it and let's just have ID favorite Let's uh let's go here oh sorry oh it should be good what's the problem now okay let's save it this is in Black so both are the same paragraph type but IDs and classes these are the main selectors you can you know um select and then uh code code snippet and style it accordingly all right so I guess the symbol selectors was all this video are in the next video we'll talk about the difference between class and ID and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in this video we are going to talk about IDs versus Plus okay so I hope you remember how we used Class how we use class and how we use ID just to give you a quick recap uh we type class we give it some class name and we use dot for that okay and for simple like for ID views hashtag ID let's just say for now okay great we can just remove everything from here and I'll remove this class as well we'll just start a fish let's see what happens okay simple nothing nothing important here okay great now you might think that okay idea like they have similar functions right but remember they are not the same and they do not always share the same purpose okay if I talk about um where's my star okay now what if I talk about IDs so first point is that each element can have only one ID okay suppose this is my header and there are two IDs let's say um sample one sample two sample one sample 2 and if I save it and let's just say I write hashtag sample one and hashtag sample two yeah this is how it would work right and suppose here I give it font size 1.5 REM and here I give it Color actor let's see now if I go back to the website and if I refresh see nothing happened why because each element can have only one ID so according to our compiler sample one pay sample 2 is a single ID both are not treated as different IDs so suppose if I write class here and I just now if I go back to a site see it changed right so that is one difference between them let's just put let's just leave it okay then second Point uh which would be here would be each page can only one element with that ID okay now this is like you can have like that okay let me just show you what I'm talking about it's intuitive okay hashtag sample two uh let's remove this part let's say ID okay okay if I go back to the website both are converted right but here what we said each page can have only one element with that ID but this is like a practice for us like this is a good practice for us I mean we should give only one eye to one element okay it's not like you cannot use it multiple times you can but it was made for such a purpose all right okay I hope you understood that and more tilts is the difference obviously ID uses hashtag okay now if I talk about classes classes you know you can use same class or multiple elements that is the practice we use dot in the class and you can use multiple classes on a single element not like this and classes are like there is a rule for writing class uh let me just say you can not have a class name with a spacing positive space con compiler would think that both are different classes which we just sorted here right okay so that was another example and play yes that was all the difference between IDs and classes like these three differences are there and one of these differences there okay and I'm again telling you this line each page can have only one element with that ID it is not a rule it is basically a practice which is used by most of the developers and you should follow the same okay so I guess that was all for this video hello everyone and welcome you all to another video of our web develop series so for the past few videos we have in talking about you know CSS we talked about the introduction to it we talked about the selectors we talked about the anatomy and few other stuff right if I just go live this is what our website looks like I mean we talked about different things here right so that is there so in this video or like I should say from this video onwards we'd be working on um website uh personal website basically I mean it's not going to be a simple uh CV website which we made there because play it was a very basic one right I mean if someone sees it they won't find it very attractive or anything like that right so that is there now let's go back to here and let's see what exactly we are going to make so this is one of the websites which I personally liked very much so this guy name is Sean helpin all right this is his website and you can see this cover page it looks uh really nice here like see this is written here right um and you can see there are other users like it's a very neat website right there are different stuff here and there as well so yeah all in all there are many stuff which is available here okay so in this video we are like try to imitate this website and make it our own all right so before we uh a few things for me I'll just clear my sheets here okay first thing is just give me a minute okay this is not okay I don't remember them let's go back here let's see how to add comments in HTML okay so this is the way all right so first step is uh create a new folder and writers my personal page okay then I want you to create an index Dot HTML okay then add boilerplate title your name whatever it is uh create style.css and link both of them and add blue background color so this is your task okay try and do it okay so of course this you don't try to do whatever the steps I told you all right so here I'll go with my explanation we'll add the boilerplate I mean this this and this is already done with me so I just start from here I have added the boilerplate I'll just add the title so my name is so I'll just do that I'll save it and then what I have already like created this childhood CSS as well so you just do it on your own and then you have to basically link them so just link and hrf style.css now here Simply Red body background color as blue saved okay okay my part here okay so there's the shoes that we have successfully um created a sheet and linked them all right now now another thing I want to talk to you guys is um before going deep into you know making the site there's something I want to talk about as favicons so you can see here at the Sean's site he got a little I couldn't write here right um so how to do that so what you have to do is write here we go on IO all right let's just go here let's have the text as yes right that works so this is what it should you know look like foreign so just show in folder um let's just try to open this one okay looks well if I open this one okay then what is this one exactly all right so what I'll do I'll just simply cut this I'll just go to the web def folder and I'll just paste it here I'll just save it okay now what I'll do I'll go here what I'm going to do I'll simply click on link this time link is not relative style sheet it's icon and it is right let's save it let's go here and you can see we got that beautiful icon right there with the name so you can have different things I mean you can go here you can add some emojis text PNG or something all right so that works now there's another thing that this uh might not work on some of the cases so what you have to do here is just change the relationship to favicon save it okay I mean see this would not work for me but it would work for you then all right and here what you have to do okay you might be wondering what is all this stuff so I would not go into detain over these things all right this is about basically the caching system which I don't uh thing is necessary for you to learn in this course so yeah here we go track it back now there's another thing you might see on Sean subsiders that it has got you know different divisions like see this division is a different thing then it got different divisions here and there and everything the positionings and everything I don't think so we have talked about right so in the next video we are going to talk about um how to you know add these divisions to which we can style differently and add different blocks in our code all right so many more to come uh in the next video so thank you for thank you for watching this video and see you later and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series so in the previous video we learned that we are going to make a new project on CSS along with it we learn a few Concepts as you will all right so if I do one thing if I go live we see what exactly I have it until now so till now we have you know basically made our boilerplate and styling sheet and Link them and to uh uh you know check uh the linking if it is right or not we have added a blue color right here okay so for now I'll just remove this look uh okay so now I'll just you know simply remove this all right so it is like this and then again one more thing was we have added an icon which is this favicon which you can see right here okay cool now let's do one thing let's try and implement this thing like what whatever is written here so you can see that this is an H1 and this is the paragraph so let's let's do the same thing here H1 um sure then let's write a paragraph tag foreign okay so okay uh as you can see here and if you see here in a different right I mean in this website it looks like the both are in close Inside the Box and if we see R it looks like they are very different right so what is different there exactly so let's just think click on inspect and see okay so this is basically I remember but if you can see there's something called div okay now you might be wondering what div is exactly right so we just go Dev MDM okay so Dev basically stands for Content division element all right now it development is the generic container for flow content okay so it has basically no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way okay it might be a little confusing for you but let me tell you what David exactly do so if I want to Club these two together what I use I lose a day so tip basically helps us to you know divide our content into separate containers so that we can affect the layout of each of the containers differently all right so what I can do here is I can write there right and I can simply paste it here but if you see not much of a difference you might be wondering what is this right but let me tell you uh the Sony Indian dogs if it is open yeah it is that it has no effect until in some way CSS is applied here so we need to apply a CSS right now before we talk about the CSS part I want to mention a few things right here uh that would be that then we think of a div basically spans from this corner to this corner and its height is equal to whatever the content is inside that thing all right that is a very important point which I wanted to mention in front of you because in the future videos we'll talk about span and then we'll see what is the difference between span and a div all right okay so let's try and give a very nice background color to our text okay so before that we'll just simply go to Color Picker CSS so okay okay it's not like this it was I don't remember exactly uh what the site's name was okay but it had a very nice one let's let's try color palette pick up for HTML okay let's see okay I remember it was color red right okay okay uh these are the basic uh you know a very nice color palettes which we can use let's go with this one all right so I'll simply copy this color copy it I'll simply come here I'll simply say class equal to ddates right whoops and here I see details and here against the background color as okay yeah see okay this color is uh not very visible so I think I'm gonna choose this color maybe and sorry guys a little bit I have actually a little bit download code not anything is serious but yeah okay I have finished the color and yeah this looks far better right I mean this is visible color like that was a nice color but it was not visible on the white background but anyways uh let's let's continue okay so this is uh now if you look closely you might see that there is a gap here this is the gap pill under the Gap here as a what is this Gap exactly I mean I will use Dev nothing above anything to the left I think to the right why it is so this is because our web browsers have here in styling so they I mean if I go to it's not paid Source sorry for that I'm going to give go to inspect like this is not able to find that right now okay but never mind you can see that there's a gap how to reduce it so this is a very nice trick which I'm going to tell you so listen to it all right you don't have to do anywhere simply right body and here have the margin as zero and then I have actually and here margin top has zero save it let's see how okay everything looks perfect right yeah then there is a line content to Center let's see if it works I don't know much up oh it doesn't enter content of temp let's see how we do a okay text align with your Center let's see if it works now okay this is a start I mean this looks nice to me at least I told about remember this looks nice to me we have done a lot of things till now and in the last video we talked about uh development uh this okay then we see a website it looks something like this pretty nice I'd say and then we go to this website says what we're trying to make okay now uh in this video we're going to talk about Box model okay now you might be wondering what is a box Water right so let's go to outside let's try to inspect fully Box model should come all right so uh yeah okay everything okay this is what is called a box model okay so in HTML every element its own box if I write a paragraph tag it would have its own box all right so a box basically has three main attributes one is padding one is the Border Anonymous margin all right so one by one uh we are going to talk about each of those boxes and then we'll try to you know do something on our own to see how we see it all right if it makes sense to you okay so first we'll talk about the Border okay let's come here let's see what we can have uh okay we will draw it I will draw it suppose this is my box this is my development okay now this div element uh would have some border right if I go here it would have some border right now what would it look like oh this there are some border like this okay trading and closing it is called it border okay I hope it was a bit clear to you I really do okay now let's try and implement it let's see how it will look if you see it you would get it uh remove pattern understanding mode right away you know I order write solid and then we say order let's suppose okay this looks let's go to our side video right okay why can't you see the Border here okay since there goes the whole part let's have a height of 200 pixels for now and uh width of 200 pixel now let's see we got it um yeah now let's do one time next is the background color too black okay okay so the color was actually equal to the background color right now so that's why you couldn't feel good this is the background I mean the Border you're talking about it trigger of 10 pixel my neck color is black right as you know and you can see the same thing is happening here okay now the other thing which we'll talk about is uh added so Suppose there is some content written inside a box so the distance between the content and the both edges mean difference or that edge or this Edge or message it is called padding okay it is called padding so what uh we are going to do is we are going to have a padding here let's save it um if I go and you can see that there's a padding around it I mean this is the content and there is the padding okay oh you might wondering okay there's not much of a change here what is the difference right that is motivated okay so let's just try to remove the body for now let's save it so let's see okay I can I see I mean I guess you might be it is different than me so guys safely add the padding and there we go by 200 and then you want to go into padding on the box then we go to border and the only thing that is left is uh we need to talk about is so margins a buffer zone okay it is basically you know uh the testing the current element and any other element that is on our screen so suppose okay there is this box as well let's call it Dev box only and the distance between them that is called the um okay so I hope uh thistles clear to you okay no okay so I told you about margin now there's one task which I would like to give you um okay so first thing you have to do is make one more container with height and that as 200 pixel only okay then the second point would be uh give it uh red color s the third thing would be change first I mean assign class to Port p divs then try or if you can't rewrite it but for now that is all you have to do okay so yeah I'm going to uh okay uh we can just change it to let's say first container so we have another div and we will have the class five second container and let's save it let's change it to let's go to website to see if it working if it is working it is working now let's add second container we'll have high dashboard pixel we have with uh 200 pixel what else uh background color will have your okay let's not do it let's see how our side looks now okay now one more thing I don't know if you might uh seen it or not but this is a total pixel box this is a 200 pixel box where is the difference make why am I getting uh so much High difference we'll talk about it so let's talk about this box yeah if I talk about this box extended and everything the address 200 pixel but because of the padding which is you know 20 200 plus 220 that is 240 if I talked about the border that would be 10 10 260. so that makes it greater than I mean it's because it the box size isn't compromised when we had the padding or when we add the Border all right even when we add imagine the box size is not compromised okay so please keep that in mind okay okay so anyway the next thing we had to do was just introduce margin here yes yes this we have separate margins as well um let's go let's save it from here no that's why I put the margin on the top of temperature as well between them becomes 20 pixel okay so this was the both model uh we had to talk about we basically had three maintenance padding model and margin so far we have learned a lot of things right let's go live and see uh uh okay okay uh I've had let's just close this um let's just go back here stop this for a while go to HTML and then we go live yeah Okay cool so we have like developed kind of a few things right so far okay cool uh now the question arises uh exactly that our site is not looking like the Sean's site right I mean yes it looks something like this which uh clearly doesn't so okay we'll try and do few things here to make our website look something like this let's go to style okay in the first container what I want is just remove the border with and Border color for now okay then we have textile and background color Okay erase all the things are fine okay something is still there which we don't want uh width is there let's move it let's let's have the padding let's remove the margin let's move the margin from here as well let's save it let's remove this solid border also let's save it okay um kind of works right I mean I can have the wet okay let's not have the weight right now okay cool okay now uh one thing I want to show you is uh this is my development project in the image I have two images one is cloud okay looks like this and one is Mountain which looks like this you can download your old images from the all right like the way I did it all right uh now I get back to here uh what I want here is I'll go to simple HTML um in the this part um I have this two sentences and below this sentence I want an image tag okay Source would be images scare nothing like this what is this Images slash uh let's have the cloud one let's save it we'll have Cloud image okay and similar thing we'll have here as well okay and then below this uh we'll have same mountains and we'll save it and we'll say Mountain image for now okay okay works let's see how it looks uh definitely we are looking for uh what is wrong here exactly um let's just remove the height as well now let's see okay okay and another thing which we can have here is uh sorry yeah here is let's remove the text Line to Center as well okay okay let's save it just give me a minute okay this this looks uh nice okay I mean we have the images not looking nice okay it's looking very houses now you might be wondering why one thing is um which I don't know is bugging to you but it is bugging to me is I have this Cloud here and then I have the sentences but here I have the cloud and adjacent to it is the mountain image so what is these what is this thing exactly what is the difference here okay so the discs uh I mean differences because of the display okay let's now go and try to read the display so display is a CSS property which sits within an element is treated as block or inline okay and the layout is used for okay that is something different but what you should be know is how it is seated block or inline let's just click here block or inline uh okay they don't have it here I'll just tell you what is the blocker and what is an inline okay suppose here I write H1 hello world H1 okay now if I have the color as red I mean it is World here and it should be like uh background color here you can see that this I mean the text is here but it is taking the whole this thing right so what is this called so this is basically called a block element which you know blocks the whole uh area not just the text all right similar thing is the paragraph tag as well para have to say and we'll just close it with this okay okay okay then I have the para title well back crown color let's say blue okay so you can see the block elements you know blocking the whole area right so that is one of the displays called block okay another of the display is called uh span ah sorry another display is called inline and example of inline could be a span okay now I'm wondering what is a span so let's just try writing span okay I mean yeah I'll simply write hello world again and I'll just close this fan okay and I'll just have this thing I'll have the background color copied from here only and let's paste it okay great work right I mean you can see that span is on like if we write span and if we try to format it it is not you know uh encapsulating the whole block it is only encapsulating the content written inside it so this type of display is called inline display okay create create now you might be thinking like okay span is working fine then why do we need a block display elements I mean what is the need there so need is there I mean suppose I want the width not to be changed I said 100 pixel right but suppose I want the width here to be 100 pixel it has 100 pixel width right so that is the thing here okay okay everything is working fine everything is cool all is good but the thing which is bugging me is if I want to use the powers of both um block and ni what can I do so CSS gives us the ability to adjust our display okay I just simply write display and I can write inline see cool trick right so this brings you to the third type of display which is in line ok here you can adjust the height let's say 100 pixel see so this gives you the advantage of both the cases all right so this is how you can see that how elements are you know adjusted in our web page using CSS okay the Box model contributes to it the display contributes to it and a few other things which we'll talk about it so I hope you learned something in this video about the display the block display in line display name block display and one more uh very uh what should I say informative tag which is the span tag all right so I guess that was all for this video and in the previous video we learned about um elements of like block elements and inline elements and how we can you know change the position okay and what else uh we talked about the positioning as I mentioned uh all right and did we talk about anything else no that was it okay so in this video we are going to talk more about how you know we position the element exactly okay so but before we do so the first thing we have to realize is that even without CSS HTML element has some positioning by default okay and we have to understand how things you know get positioned by default before we can go and change it to bend the rules okay so the first rule is that content is everything okay suppose here I have uh let's say I have a dip uh hello and here I have a span okay and if I write the div let's see this and I have this one let's see okay take a so we can see that okay in div in Span the content is like this okay it just encapsulates C whole content it's fine that the it has the whole block like this but the height is in accordance to the element only so that's why the first rule is that um content is everything all right the second rule I would say is children sit on parents okay now I'm wondering what I mean by that exactly so suppose I just remove the hello from here okay and here I have height say 100 pixel and let's say with 100 pixel as well for now okay and if I have this pan inside this div so div is a parent and span would be the child all right so you can see that our span or a child sits on the parent right so that is what children said on the parents mean so these are the basic two rules of positioning okay now uh we can also you know set CSS property like other than the positional thing okay uh I mean other than this position or nothing um like the default position thing we can also write a CSS property which is position property in order to position elements on okay so basically there are two position properties static and relative so let's talk about the static so okay we have talked about this article because this default HTML thing I mean positioning of how how how this would be positioned how this would be positioned how this would be positioned is um simple static all right and if I talk about the relative one uh relative positioning is uh basically how uh you would you know a positional element relative to how absolute it was okay I don't know if it made sense to you but let's try something and then we'll be able to I guess I would be able to get it what I'm trying to say here so okay I'm giving you a task make three divs of a square diff of 100 plus 100 by 100 and give them colors of red blue and yellow okay pause the video and do it oh yeah meanwhile I'm gonna do it let's say the class as read okay okay this works right now let's just now let's have the blue one let's do something let's just copy this thing and there's a space here uh change the color to Blue okay and let's uh let's paste it change the color to yellow okay okay cool now suppose I changed the position to um sorry position to relative okay and now I put the top to 20 pixel you see this element be here according to the its static position but since it is a relative position it would you know shift to 20 pixels downward from the top uh whether friends to the absolute position and the one of the major thing is that other elements would still be at their absolute position so if I simply just say 100 pixels good you know come down here and the other element would just you know uh vanish okay so this is all that we have to talk about the positioning absolute answers and how default positioning is done by HTML okay so far in the couple of previous videos we learned about the positioning of elements in our um website right we learned about inline elements we learned about block elements we learned about inline block element we learned about the fixed position and the absolute position and the related position all right so let's do one thing let's go live here and try to see what we have achieved so far okay okay let's remove this red box I don't know why it is still there okay now let's see uh Okay cool so this is what our website uh looks like currently okay now uh one thing which I think we can have it all we can have all these elements towards the center right that is one of the bare minimum so to do that we have text align as I told you which we can have in the body now let's just enter let's see how it looks hmm okay great now one thing I want to tell you is if we inspect it um yeah you can see that all the text uh which are aligned or I mean see it just as a cloud okay let's have it I mean other than the image all the things which are aligned like this so these are basically the uh block element all right like they have the full block like this right the whole inline things right suppose um I change the width to 10 percent now what will happen see as soon as it gets upload it becomes a block element um yeah so that it becomes a block element the texture line uh don't work on it so what is like what can we do here what we can do here is we can have the margin top would be zero right would be Auto bottom would be zero and left will be orders okay now I have a jacket uh this is how you Center all right so this was all uh about you know centering how we Center an element so these two are the main methods by which we can Center the element all right all right so I'll just um removed from here for now uh I'll have margin top uh zero let's say back to what we have okay great now another thing which you might be noticing is that this mountain is not aligned in the center because of um This Cloud right um This Cloud basically is like a hindrance right so we have to you know remove this uh cloud from the HTML flow so whenever I remember how we take an element of of the HTML Flow by changing one particular CSS property and yeah that is of course a position property that we are going to change all right um now let's try to see uh what we can change here exactly okay let's do one thing uh this is the cloud um I'll give it a class called bottom Cloud okay uh let's move this is good and I'll say bottom cloud and simply I have the position absolutely why there is no difference here okay okay okay and the third this is our first container so thank you let's have the position whereas related okay and let's have the left of what let me see okay um 50 pixels okay okay I'm not sure why this thing is not working uh like um let's see let's see let's see there is uh probably sometime which we are missing um what can it be what is that one thing uh which we are nothing let us check the name if it is correct it's bottom cloud okay I mean one of the most any mistakes but okay okay I mean uh it is uh something not one thing you want but it is something so this is because we don't he should not be having what should not be adding uh suppose I just say 10 bucks what difference would it bring let's see okay let's say 300 pixels and okay and left May I'll say 300 pixel okay right so yeah okay let's have it 400 pixels looks pretty nice right so my next challenge is to be to ha let's make it 400 I will let's see how it would look I mean it depends all on you okay not 400 fold it will look nice let's say 350. now let's see let's see okay I mean for me it worked I mean I can have it to 330 okay that works for me that was really fine for me okay now I want you I want to give you guys a challenge to move this uh uh I'm Legit forgetting the words right now but yeah let's move this Cloud somewhere here okay let's have some padding over here I would say right uh first container let's have some adding top let's say 100 pixels you see this is another look s unfortunate let's say let's see in this bag let's see why they're not working Cloud I should be obviously adding you know okay well I'm having some baggage okay we'll talk about the batting thing later but um I'm glad like you understood and just try to move this from here to here somewhere hmm so what what what we can do is uh we can have classes um because there obviously a cloud um we love the position again as absolute um what we can have more would be let's have top of 50 pixels right and I'll write as okay let's see how it looks okay where this mountain is a little bit far so we should be having this amount of bit far as well so let's have the left task in pixel as well but okay so now you guys tell me how it looks I mean for me it looks better and I a little bit um what is this uh let's write shown okay it's looking a little bit like this right so okay that's a good start now in the next video we would be trying to change the font here because because of it the positioning changes sometimes it should see all about in the next video hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in the last video we learned about the what I call the Dark Art of centering elements using CSS all right we did it using two methods and we learned about um what we say uh absolute positioning as well and if I go live this is what my website looks like it looks pretty neat to me at least all right so I mean I'll give that to me that this looks nice okay uh now what I would be going to talk about is these texts right uh which I already talked about how to I mean uh I am going to talk about them right so yeah let's let's uh just start with that all right great okay now there are basically two font families one is a difference between serif and trans surveys these tiny legs which are present in the serif but are present in these answers okay now let's just try with the example let's say upon family the kind between a lot but uh main are sand setup let's see how it looks okay there's my website okay it's there so we'll see there are no little legs there and there so there is that then we have syrup let's see how it looks see the little legs okay then what else we have we have bonus space right I mean mono spaces uh every letter has you know like equal gap between them then let's see I mean it looks a bit terrible right and there is one fantasy as well if I remember correctly okay this looks really bad so these are the basic font families then um we talked about Siri so Sans serif and serif has basically like these upon families so there are definite fonts present in them right so let me show you some things let's say for family I will say uh answer it for now let's see how it looks it looks like you okay then there is wordana which is under the only and it looks little thing like this okay so I okay one more thing is um you are seeing all these things right like you might be wondering okay what the hell is this right uh so suppose guys just type the subject right okay so you might be a little bit uh short to low but I mean the first time when I read about it okay so this is basically uh all these fonts may or may not be present on someone's computer I mean three it's not present on my computer I mean uh this one is present on my computer but there is a high possibility that this might not be present on yours all right then what would happen uh your system would look for this if not it would go for this if not it would look for this and if not transfer refers I mean it is right about there so this is you know a safe place by versus like being very specific and love being very general okay so let's start that is all we have to talk about the whole family now another very pretty thing which I want to talk to you guys is I mean suppose you are a person who is very specific and won't start whatever font you are seeing on your screen should be visible to the other person out there so how to do that okay so I would recommend you to go to false short Google okay google.com let's see no not not this one exactly over here before um let's see yeah let's make a better alternator let's put a font awesome I don't wanna login right now I'm not able to find it where did it go exactly let's try I mean I'm not sure where they are going wrong let's check okay it has been there what what was I even doing here okay phones.google.com uh you can search it from there um create now something I wanted let's say Merryweather I want this one all right I'll let them play over here uh the regular one okay right now okay we have something then let's have another one which I like I like it is my personal favorite Sacramento okay I have it already but let's selected for now okay what else yeah we don't have the Sacramento is that okay okay now let's write uh snap okay I got it what I was doing there just don't mind me let us select the regular okay yeah go and do I need something else um let's have monster hat as well for that let's have the 400 is copy this link okay let's go to your HTML let's paste it that is it now suppose for the body I want uh and recently press it and here I'll do what I'll have the Sacramento I just copy it and I'll just paste it and for H2 which I don't have currently but I will have it future and it's three I'll have the font family uh not set up um it says pasted and Here Also let's just paste it that's it now if I go to my website okay this looks uh trading design domain right this is the Sacramento one this is the normal marinated right so that was all I had to talk about default all right I hope you like this video you learned a lot through this and I hope you apply this in your project as well so far we have learned a lot of things and and I mean learned basics of CFS then learned Advanced or I would say intermediate CSS as such which included a lot of things okay in centering the difference between their and span and how to style a text okay so in order to you know style our text or to change the text property and go to exclude more ways of styling the text we have to have more content on our website okay if we go live right now this is what our website looks like but we need more content here all right so what to do okay so I have something for you um yeah okay I have something for you file all right I'll put the description in the uh sorry I haven't delete all the thing in the description and you can download it from there so in one time we'll open it and what we are going to do here left contains something like middle container and okay whatever it contains you got to do we just copy it and Below first container just paste it okay so yeah that is what you have to do and let's just save it and let's see what else it looks like okay now you are wondering what is this right so this is some text which we have here okay here we put in information of ourselves and I will tell you what we'll put but first of all let's try and understand what is like everything written here so in the Metro container what we have we have a profile you can add your image here or any image you want and then we have a Hello and then we have this lorem of SIM card or something something so it is a very I have to create time to tell you what it means let's just write our website and it's taking a bit okay I mean I don't know hydrogen such so much time we'll get through one thing let's go to settings and let's just change the search engine to Google okay and now let's okay it hasn't changed why let's see let's go together and uh okay let's see stored search engine let's go to Google pocket house let's switch type lorem and there you have something close it and close it from here and let's play go ahead and get back and here you can see what is Lauren looks um it is its own tummy text of the predicant type setting industry Okay so what happens basically is when you design a website you know that you would have be having some content over here like you would be having some content over here some content over here some content over here but what exactly you don't know at that time so to happen so you have Tamil content uh over like as a placeholder and later you can you know just modify it uh content from the placeholder all right so that is there all right now let's let's do one thing let's try and add some photos here I mean there is a very famous website called Flat icons where you can get Vector images okay and there are like hundreds of icons just go on V1 and you can see like there are hundreds and hundreds of icons present here and you can choose any one of them so suppose I go with Avatar job description Avatar looks fine I go over here what I do um let's pick this photo let's just download the PNG it has downloaded right uh okay go in a folder what I'll do is copy it if you go to our web page in the menu folder we just place it okay looks great now what we'll do we'll come back here in the middle container in this you can have images this is my PNG let's save it let's see how the website looks now okay I mean uh before me needing this big of a picture who will try a little bit let's just say class circles allow okay we go to our style and here I also good okay and I have the model radius of 50 percent all right now if I see the website um let's say represent knowledge okay okay it's right it does not a round figure but not much of a round so let's say okay let's have the width as 100 pixels and five times 100 pixel as well now let's see how it looks hmm looks nice right and instead of this uh you can any other image you can find on the flat icon and you can just simply paste it I mean just copy the image here okay okay similarly uh We Have Skills section as well okay and I have a skills photo here like let's say I go back here skills which I'm liking I'll just simply say coding I mean I'm liking this one okay this is not something I would be needing I have to do something from here so let's say I choose this one looks fine I'll just download it what I'll do I'll go in the folder okay show my folder uh I just cut it and I'll just paste it over here right same and I um close it now here what I have uh here I have the four five images file extension and let me close answer circles I'll save it now let's see what it looks like I mean it looks amazing to me at least we have some other picture over here like whatever you want but for now I have the same one okay and great now okay looks amazing and then the last container we have contact me phone type where you can mail to wherever you want let me just type in my mail ID okay then in the bottom container you can have different links and here you can have a name and surname as a copyright name that is put in my name now if I go back to my website this is what we have got so far I mean we can increase a bit over here let's say 200 save it let's say we create perfect looks amazing right now this is me so I would put my photo over here you can have a photo here you can give a small introduction over here for now I have just determi text because I'm just showing it to you right and again same text over here something something here and get in touch something something then contact the mail your social profiles uh URL you can have in the copyright photo so we have got a lot of content over asking now which read format or change the properties in the upcoming video and in the previous video we copy the code from the sub code file which I I told you in the previous video okay now if I click on go live uh we can see that we have got something here we have got the content now we can try and talk about them all right now one thing I want to talk about you guys is on science okay suppose I want this thing to be the created suppose okay I mean I want it to be more greater than everything like move it around the H1 standard size so that like really ultimate heading thing all right so what what that what will do what we'll do is we'll go here in this one I am going to have font size 90 pixel wasn't up let's say 50 pixels great it looks a lot bigger and everything uh I say zero only press V and I click ok so it looks a lot nicer right create but uh we have like mentioned it in pixel but there is one another um any Dimension em before talking about em let us see like what else like why don't means pixel suppose I go to settings I go to appearance and in the font size which is the medium which is recommended I click on large now if I come here uh you notice okay I'll get through it very large so one thing you might have noticed is size of this text has not been changed by size of this text why is that because then we declare a font size and pixel we have like fixed that thing okay like that is a static value to have it in a dynamic we use PM okay so let me tell you what is VM first so El okay here is like um sound of M so when uh previous uh times 1 em was equal to uth and size of L okay but in the modern days one pm is equal to 16 pixel okay now if I change this part because I wanted to be an email ID password 90 by 16. which would come roughly to 5.625 am okay go back same size okay create everything looks good now another property I want to talk about um EMS um if suppose I have one side here but one size is a basically you know derived value suppose here in the body I have a font size of 2 am and there are so h1nl inside body so it's one parent is body right so if I have font size in the body and if I have a font size in H1 this font size would become equal to 5.625 plus just two okay so if I go here you can see okay it looks very very right if I have only same side what I'll do I'll do 3.65 oh okay but there are not a very you know like this is a small code so you can see uh check whose parents have got what size but in big codes it is very hard to debug this thing so in order to have this value to be on its own and not to be derived we use something called REM okay R stands for root so if I put this value so I guess we talked about the font size here and this was one of the most uh important and crucial parts we should be known between difference between pixel Emi and Ariens all right so okay and so far um let's look at the website which we have created something like this where it looks nice right oh great okay something um I want to have here is in the body let's remove this it's looking too big but that right now if I go here yeah it looks much smaller now better okay great now I would like to in this video uh try and um have a skills and some nice way okay I mean to format it in a nice frame so for formatting uh one thing I would like to have let's have the inspect okay uh Lindy class row you can see that we have two divs for two different foreign I wanted to change the width to 50 okay this is your first challenge for the video and try it okay now if I talk about if I want to drive what I will do is I will go on scale through make sure it matches the name here okay and here you can have with us 50 save it and see how it looks okay enough inspect folder you can see it has a fifty percent and this fifty percent is left great now another thing which I want is to send but enter these shapes in the middle for that we learned about the margin let's say Auto let's save it and it is in the margin I mean at a sensory Center but I'm not liking this part all this space I need to have some spacing so 1200 pixel margin on top and bottom and leave the left and right to uh Auto so pause the video and try it so if I have to do it what I'll do I'll write 100 pixel and if I go clockwise it would be right so Auto and then again bottom would be 100 pixel and then again that model would be Auto if I save how would it look hmm I mean I got the margin here and here so it looks pretty nice now another thing uh which I want from you guys is to have this uh text in the left part not in the center part so here we have the texture line of Center but here I want to have the text aligners left for that you know you can simply write text line left and what it will do it would override their text line just here so if I look at it looks something like this okay great now now what else what else is and you can see that there's no much space here right so what to do on this thing like I want to have some space here what we can have here is we can have uh line height okay you can see the difference see there is some like line height difference and it looks uh pretty better than before okay and then what else okay one thing I didn't tell you in the previous video you can use this stickers I'll show you the lots of they can be used here go to Jiffy or click on be animated and here you can write code okay uh and click on the stickers part let's see what stickers we can get from here fight is a bit slow if I click on scales let's see what it shows me okay I don't know why I got the images are not okay okay but um okay there's a lot of thing at all I don't know what the problem is okay we'll see it in see it at the end of the video we'll see if this you guys get loaded we'll try and inculcate it otherwise we will go with this image cool so far we have formatted our skills set a bit but I want to do one time which would look totally cool but it is not right now which is I want to wrap these texts around here okay and then I should be here and this text should wrap it or somewhere around here how to achieve that so for that let me just reduce it to say 25 percent okay and Here Also let's do 25 percent I don't know I mean obviously we cannot individ but let's see okay looks nice so for that what we do is we learn about um new ones are called float okay just go float CSS property and see what it is exactly so close property specifies whether an element should float left right or not at all all right so absolutely positioned elements ignore the flow property so rather than seeing any running the theory let's go for the uh learning it in Practical all right float and I feel like and if I save it so you float today okay that's why we had a problem foreign so that's why we are facing that problem let's move the plot for now now see it's back okay okay uh pretty much not what we need or getting the correct stickers here I would say let's just say I'm coding it we'll let it open it from we come back here what we will do we will have some other class here let's say kill image and here also I'm going to have 12. image okay and if I go here what I'll do I'll kill image okay I have these two things and then I am going to half note left okay only through one thing I'll have skill image one and climate I'll tell you why I am doing this let's save it let's see so this is what I was talking about see if all texts are wrapping this text around okay but I see that there's no Gap here so how to have a gap here so what we can do we can simply have uh margin from the left of 100 pixel so cannot from left from right great now see looks nice right Now new challenge for you would be to have this part to something slowly like this but this image should come here and the text would be somewhere here did we get an image okay cool so can you do that for me try it so what you can do is you can do skill image to you can have these things okay and in the float you can have right okay and margin then from the right should be 50 pixel now let's see great okay how awesome does this look right the MySQL section is looking something like this and another parts coming here like two years only looks really great right and one more thing which we can have and we can have this color on all the parts that would look great right okay we got something how about this suppose I just copied it I just came here and from here if I please set and let me save it let's see did we get it create a little bit look wonderful right you can have some other image on the second part as well uh let's say what's I would say I mean this looks nice let's just copy this uh don't tell me we have to wait again but okay we can wait and by the end of this lecture I mean two or three minutes and we can get these signals so let's wait for that time but okay we want to have this color here so what we'll do we'll check watercolor was because you simply copy it and put it in the background looks nice to me at least and I hope you guys also like it great um so many images but yeah we're gonna add this one and if I try to paste it here it would look good I mean it's not looking very nice over here right so let's move that image let's have some other image so we can do one thing you can have the Border radius I have let's say 60 percent and let's see what time that see it now yeah looking much better okay so so far I mean I'm liking what have done and we learned about the float and we learned about you know these stickers which we can use great we learned about this property as well so yeah I mean that move it which I wanted you guys to know here all right and one thing which we can have this between the here we can have HR tag okay great and okay I'm not getting okay let's see what HR thickness how we can have HR okay see it says move we check uh then height add one pixel let's say char and stream it let's see okay nothing much happened let's try and just copy this part let's see how it would look foreign and so far we have created our project all right let's click on go live and see what we have created so far so okay great this is what it looks like right nice now I want to uh you know I have planned something that this video and next video most probably uh we'll have you know I'll uh walk you uh through this like site or through some styling which I'm going to do and I would highly recommend you to you know follow me along this these two videos we are talking about minute minute changes which you are going to put on our site to look at more presentable than it is right now all right so yeah let's let's try and do this great cool now uh before I talk about anything um what I want is right now I want your text color to be a little grayish okay I mean you can see the text color it is little black but if it is a little grayish that would look cool right so the code for that would be 4 0 um 514 e okay I save it I go and I see yeah I mean it's not much of a change but it looks nice all right and then on H1 and H2 I want a little different color you can have any color of your choice but what I'm thinking is a little of aqua okay create and on H2 I am thinking of having the same okay on H3 as well great now if I go back looks nice right um great uh what else we can have here is okay now um we got the height and everything now what I want is to have a gap between these two I mean this cap and you know this Gap there's no gap between you know bottom container and middle container middle container and top container so for the Gap I am going to go on the uh what have I named it here middle container right so I don't think so I have any middle container here so I'll just have one metal container let me just check your spelling okay that's fine okay let's try and try the metal container we'll go for margin we want top margin to be hundred pixel we don't want any left margin so it would be Auto bottom margin would be 100 pixels and then again Auto great now if we go back hmm looks nice right now one more thing I want is uh here we have class of circuits if I check what is circles width is fine but I want to change the height as well let's say net pixel okay loaded Holland pixel let's remove this let's have beta 100 pixel height 100 pixels now let's go and see okay it looks a bit small so let's make it 200 now we go check perfect great looking nice right now another thing which I want would be I mean c this row die it is a single long line it is not looking nice at least not to me so what I am thinking of doing here is like I'll give it a class I'll say intro I save it and here I'll have a intro and here I am going to have width as let's say 40 percent let's save it let's see okay looks looks better but we want to be on Center so here we'll have the margins as Auto and yeah this is how it looks it's nice agreed great great great great uh what else we can have here is okay no no no no no what else we can have on our website to make it look better like can you think okay we can change this this long line doesn't look nice so for this thing we are going to try something okay there's a standard code so just uh we not remember it but try to understand it okay you're going to have dotted we are going to have thickness as X pixel and here we have color which would be Gray would look like and let's save it Drago that looks something like this it looks not very nice but it is what it is now the Border bottom has to be zero because we want only single line or none okay I go a single line I don't want so many dots so I can have with uh like four percent that would work okay looks nice and margin here should be 100 pixel from the top 0 pixel Auto from the left 100 pixel from the bottom and auto from the right let's save it let's see okay looks nice right yes great work great work now okay I'll give you a challenge like this has been made I want you guys do it exactly what we did here okay so uh I would like um suggest you guys to try this thing okay and this would look nice so try it okay if I go here I check in the bottom what is there as such no class has been assigned to it so we'll assign a class bottom okay and you are going to have Dot bottom this is what I have written okay great now this was the code I copy it and paste it here save it if I go back looks nice right but it doesn't have you know uh I mean because margin is auto that's why I guess the problem is so let's do one thing let's have Auto 100 pixel Auto and let's see it now okay okay let's have it at 60 hmm let's have it as 40. 40 pixel sorry yeah looking great right now the last thing I want you guys to understand in this video is you have to change this contact me button okay for that we have something CSS button generator okay if you go to this website you can have your button as your own okay now here I want not click me but I want contactly font is five or we can have this font you can choose your own color I mean for me this would look nice it hasn't changed okay font size fine box everything's fine border I would like to change it to 8 so that it gets a square shape all right and background this works fine however I don't and so we need anything in the hover part okay so let's just copy this whole code from here okay and then we are going to paste it here simply just paste it now you go to HTML and you see your I mean it has button only so if you go to a website now I'll see button okay great looks nice right now you can change the color here on your own pose I want to have the same color which we are having here let's just copy it and let's just try and paste it okay I mean color is different I don't think we can find it but 3. color is different right so yeah so I mean we have I mean we did a lot of things in this video okay we had some hide I mean patterns we have this cute little dots we made this contact me button we centered the textures like this and everything so yeah everything looks cool so I guess that was all for this video at least and in this and if you remember in the previous video we styled our website let's see okay uh my bad let's just close this just go back here don't show again now let's play okay we added these underlines and what else we added this button okay great now one thing which I did was I changed the color of our lower part two simple white and this part of key one which was there previously okay so in this video all we are going to do is we are going to talk about the footer part in order to put a part one thing uh that is concerning me here practice but it looks little out of place right because of the font so what can we do simply we can do one thing um style.css so we'll just copy this and you know we are just going to have to paste it you will save it on now but it looks pretty nice no uh if we have to format the footer part so it's class with bottom retainer so we have bottom container and here I'm going to have my um background color uh six um sorry call background color here uh background colors yeah nice the same color which we are using for the font um let me show you yeah yeah it looks something like this nice oh one thing you must just start you can see this thing we have some Gap why is that already told you that web pages by themselves sign Auto margins so how to cover that exactly we can cover them with padding so let's have our top adding a 50 pixel okay um left adding a zero bottom parting is 20. uh and left adding and see next thing and we'll see looks nice right so it is there now another thing which I want to change is these um anger tags so what we're going to do is for the anchor tags let me open yeah okay so for the anchor tags what we can do here we can first of all change the color of the text to let's say one one okay now if you go back you can see it looks nice you mean it is a little same to the color but I actually prefer this when using the links all right now you can see that we have these underlines which I don't want so these underlines are as you know already provided by uh HTML for the angle tags to remove that we can use the text decoration so in this text decoration of let's say okay great now uh there is no gap between them so let's put some gap between them for Gap you know we have to put the margin let's have the top margin of Centerview uh right marginal 20 pixel left marginalized if I go back and look yeah looks looks better rate the only thing left is to have the phone family we are going to have this one family only and we'll save it now sorry yeah okay looks pretty nice right the only thing which is left is I don't I mean if we user comes from the website he won't be able to recognize that what is this when I hover over it I want something different so for that we already know something which is pseudo class right I hope you remember guys you can just scoop over and watch the videos so we have this thing over we have our order I want the color to be more a bit White Shadow white which is e e f 6 F6 okay now you go and look and you see looks great all right I mean already know what to do right great now the amazing item left is to have the copyright part so for that let's just see if we have something okay we don't have any class so let's add a class here let's name as copyright okay and let's our copyright fine okay now first of all I want the color so we can have the same color uh the white one looks pretty neat looks nice right now I want this text to be reduced the contrast will be reduced it's a 0.6 75 RM okay three fourth of 16 pixels it is right so it looks nice but small and I wanted to be at the bottom so to get it at the bottom I have to have padding so adding will be what we go bottom container the bottom padding is 20 pixels foreign and it looks nice right so well right here that was on which we could do this website it looks pretty nice to me we have a nice you know starting page I mean starting what did I say this um welcome thing let's just call it to our company then we have our intro you know obviously informative as for yourself then you have these and then we have contact thing and then we have our link and our population oh I guess start overall which was really taught in this video and congratulations your website is completed details add to your data page you can you know show it to the people you want it looks good so from this part I can probably say you are done with your intermediate CSS skills so attach on your back and from the next video onwards we would look into bootstrap all right so I won't get into bootstrap in this video at all so from the next video we will talk about bootstrap what is bootstrap and how we would inculcate it in our files all right so thank you for watching this video and see you later
