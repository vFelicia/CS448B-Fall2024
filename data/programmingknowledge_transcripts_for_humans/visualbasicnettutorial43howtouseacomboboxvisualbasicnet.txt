00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - combo box with your Visual Basic Windows
00:07 - Form application so let's get started
00:10 - I'm going to take a combo box from my
00:15 - toolbox and I will take a button and I'm
00:19 - going to take our text box from
00:21 - here so I have three
00:25 - items or three controls first of all I'm
00:29 - going to to change the font size of
00:31 - these items I will select all of them
00:35 - and I will go to the property called
00:37 - font and I will change the font from
00:40 - here okay now what I'm going to do
00:46 - is let me change the text of this button
00:50 - also so that
00:53 - it has the
00:55 - text
00:58 - add items
01:00 - so why we use combo box combo box uh
01:03 - generally we use for containing the
01:08 - items different items or a list of items
01:11 - right so one way of populating the list
01:14 - of item in the combo box is directly
01:17 - just select your combo box and go go to
01:21 - the property
01:24 - called items and just click the small
01:28 - button and in here you can add your
01:31 - items for example I want to make uh list
01:35 - of items for names so I will write some
01:39 - names here I will
01:41 - write first name and press enter second
01:46 - name and press enter third name press
01:51 - enter fourth name and press enter and in
01:55 - this way you can make a list of items
01:59 - one by one and when you click okay and
02:02 - when you run the
02:06 - program and when you see this list you
02:09 - are going to see the list in here and
02:12 - whenever you select any item from the
02:15 - list it's going to be selected in here
02:19 - in the combo box right so this is one
02:23 - way of populating
02:25 - your list
02:28 - box the other way is populating your
02:31 - list box at run time so for example I
02:35 - want to uh populate my list box whenever
02:38 - I enter some name in the text box so how
02:43 - can we do this I will just select my
02:45 - button and double click it and in here I
02:48 - will
02:50 - write the name of my combo box so I will
02:54 - write combo box one which is the name of
02:57 - my combo box
03:03 - dot items dot add okay and what I'm
03:10 - going to add here in this bracket I will
03:13 - pass the argument text
03:16 - [Music]
03:17 - box one which is the name of my text box
03:21 - dot text right
03:26 - so this line what this line will do is
03:30 - whatever text I will add in the text box
03:34 - it will
03:35 - add the item in the combo box so let me
03:39 - demonstrate what this is doing is for
03:42 - example I will add some names in the
03:44 - text
03:46 - box and I will say add item and when you
03:50 - see this here you see one more item is
03:55 - added to the list here right so
04:00 - in this way the items are added to the
04:04 - combo box for example
04:08 - some new
04:10 - name and I will add item and now it has
04:15 - one more item so in this way you can add
04:18 - more items to the list Box by adding a
04:24 - adding the items dynamically or at run
04:27 - time okay so let let me get rid of the
04:31 - collection which I have created here I
04:34 - think I haven't deleted the connection
04:37 - collection I will delete it and press
04:40 - okay and let me check whether I have so
04:45 - now I don't have any collection and I
04:47 - can add some collection so some name
04:51 - some other
04:52 - name so you can see items are added to
04:58 - the list box right now for example
05:03 - Whatever item I select in the combo box
05:08 - I want to show the message that this
05:11 - item is selected so what I am going to
05:14 - do is I'm going to select this combo box
05:18 - and double click
05:19 - it and in here I will
05:27 - say message
05:30 - box Dosh
05:32 - show and in
05:35 - the message box show argument I will
05:39 - pass combo
05:42 - box one which is the name of my combo
05:45 - box dot text
05:50 - okay and now when I run the program
05:55 - first of all let me add some names
06:00 - first
06:03 - name second
06:07 - name third
06:11 - name fourth name so I have some names in
06:15 - the combo box four names or and whenever
06:18 - I select some name from here for example
06:21 - mark it will show me the message
06:26 - box with the name Mark okay
06:30 - and I select some other name John and it
06:32 - shows me the message box saying John so
06:36 - in this way you can display the selected
06:39 - item in the combo box
06:42 - right but some more other time you also
06:47 - may want to make this combo box
06:52 - noneditable right so just select your
06:56 - combo box and go to the property
07:03 - called so just select your combo box and
07:06 - go to the property called dropdown style
07:10 - and just select here instead of drop
07:13 - down just select drop down list and this
07:17 - will make your combo box
07:20 - noneditable so what the
07:23 - non-editable combo Box means is you
07:26 - cannot enter any text here you can just
07:29 - see and it's just read only and you
07:33 - cannot enter
07:34 - [Music]
07:36 - any item or any text here and when you
07:40 - do it drop down it's like you can enter
07:45 - some text manually inside this combo box
07:49 - so in this way you can use combo box in
07:54 - Visual Basic you can explore combo box
07:58 - properties to uh change the its
08:01 - properties and you can customize how you
08:04 - want to use combo box I hope you have
