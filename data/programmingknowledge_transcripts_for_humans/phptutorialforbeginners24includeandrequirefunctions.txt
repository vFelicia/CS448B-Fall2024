00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - include and require function in
00:07 - PHP so for example I have a a PHP file
00:12 - which is just containing um uh HTML code
00:17 - and which is just printing some header
00:20 - on the browser so I will just save it
00:23 - and I will S I will just browse for
00:28 - header.php and it's just print
00:30 - programming knowledge here now sometimes
00:34 - or most of the times you want uh some
00:37 - template to you know appear whenever you
00:42 - use uh your PHP code so for example you
00:46 - want to use this template which shows
00:49 - this header in different PHP file okay
00:52 - so how can we do
00:54 - that so for example I will make one more
00:57 - PHP file and I will call call it
01:01 - page page
01:04 - 1. P
01:07 - PHP and I
01:09 - will one more I will create one more PHP
01:13 - file and I will call it page
01:17 - to.php okay so I have these two PHP file
01:21 - and I will just
01:24 - quickly make this
01:28 - template
01:31 - and in here for example I
01:34 - want that I want to use this header file
01:40 - okay so I want to make this header file
01:43 - once and I want to use this in different
01:46 - PHP pages okay in different PHP files
01:49 - how can I do this I can use this include
01:53 - function and include this header file in
01:58 - my PHP 1 and php2 page so let's see how
02:02 - so what you need to do is you just need
02:05 - to use the
02:08 - keyword include and then in single codes
02:11 - just give the name of your uh
02:15 - header.php which you want to use here so
02:19 - my header PHP is like this header do pH
02:27 - PHP okay now what this code will do is
02:31 - it will call this
02:34 - header.php because all these uh three
02:38 - files are in same folder that's why I
02:41 - can call this uh for example if you want
02:44 - to go up one folder you can use it like
02:47 - this or for example you want to use uh
02:51 - some uh if you have this file in some
02:54 - other folder inside you can use it
02:57 - folder slash something like this
03:00 - but because this these all three files
03:02 - are in the same same folder that's why
03:07 - I'm not giving any path here okay
03:09 - otherwise you need to give relative path
03:13 - uh whenever you your header files are in
03:16 - different folder and your other
03:20 - functional file are in other folder okay
03:24 - now I can include this file in my P page
03:28 - one and page two
03:30 - like this just use include and the name
03:32 - of the and then I can
03:36 - call page one so page 1.
03:43 - PHP and it will give me some kind
03:49 - of let's see what's the
03:52 - error I don't see any error here so
03:55 - let's try it once again okay this is
03:59 - Page 1 Dot and I have used comma here so
04:03 - instead of page 1
04:05 - dot now it will work so whenever we call
04:09 - Page One this header is called right
04:12 - this header and whenever we call
04:16 - page2.php
04:17 - also this header will be called right so
04:22 - page one and page two has the same
04:23 - header right so this include function
04:27 - enables us to use the same same template
04:30 - if you have in different PHP files now
04:34 - for
04:35 - example I have uh I can declare some
04:39 - variable variable page one and I can
04:45 - show some message here for example I can
04:48 - show we are in page one okay and we can
04:57 - Echo this ech
05:01 - e page
05:04 - one and in the same way I will do the
05:08 - same in my page two so this will be my
05:11 - page two variable this will be my page
05:13 - two variable and this will be two okay I
05:17 - save it and let's see what happens so we
05:20 - are in page
05:22 - 1.
05:23 - PHP and I can see this uh Echo message
05:27 - here we are in page one and whenever I
05:30 - call Page 2. PHP we see we are in page
05:34 - two right so this include function just
05:39 - include the header and we will be able
05:41 - to do our other task which are
05:44 - inherently uh done by page one and page
05:48 - two also in these uh page one and page
05:52 - two PHP
05:54 - okay or for example you decide to use
05:58 - these uh variables in this header file
06:01 - also you can do the this just like this
06:06 - so for example I can just declare in my
06:09 - header.php I can just
06:13 - say
06:17 - PHP and in here I can declare this
06:22 - variable which
06:24 - is page one right page one I just cut it
06:29 - from here and in my header.php and my
06:32 - PHP tags I can just paste it here and
06:36 - same I will do from my page two right so
06:40 - in a way I have declared all my
06:42 - variables in this header.php and I want
06:46 - to use this these variables in page one
06:49 - and page two I'll save it and once again
06:52 - run it let's see what happens so I can
06:55 - still get the same result here page 1.
06:59 - PHP P will show me page one and Page
07:02 - two. PHP will show me page we are in
07:05 - page two right so in this way you can
07:09 - use the
07:10 - include function to call files or files
07:16 - uh and whatever variables or whatever
07:20 - values are there in the files you can
07:23 - just import it in your PHP file just by
07:27 - using this include right in the same way
07:31 - you can use require function also so we
07:34 - can use instead of this include require
07:39 - function require and this will also work
07:44 - the same
07:45 - way that uh of include so I will just
07:50 - save it and when I refresh this it works
07:54 - same as include function right for page
07:57 - one also it's it works same same as
07:59 - include function but for
08:03 - example I am uh I'm including some text
08:07 - before this page one VAR page two
08:09 - variable and page one variable so for
08:12 - example I can just
08:14 - say
08:16 - page
08:18 - info and I just concatenate this in page
08:22 - 2. PHP and page1.php
08:25 - okay and I save it and whenever I use
08:30 - this require here okay and whenever uh
08:35 - this header name is for example by
08:37 - mistake I have missed misspell this
08:41 - header name so this is not a uh I mean
08:45 - original header or header which exist
08:48 - this is non-existent header Right In
08:51 - Here Also in our page two we just
08:54 - provide the path of the header which
08:55 - doesn't exist and we save it and when we
08:59 - refresh
09:00 - this we see
09:03 - here the warning and the error and we
09:06 - don't see this page info message even so
09:12 - what this required does is whenever it
09:15 - sees that uh it cannot find this uh
09:19 - header file or this PHP file which you
09:23 - have provide the path of then it kills
09:26 - your page so whatever you write or you
09:30 - whatever you want to execute after this
09:32 - include or after this require function
09:35 - and if this header is not an existing it
09:38 - will kill your page after that okay and
09:41 - this same in the case of this but
09:43 - whenever we use
09:46 - include include here in page one and
09:49 - page two and save it see what happens I
09:53 - refresh it and even this is showing the
09:58 - error but it will execute your U
10:02 - messages or whatever functionality you
10:05 - are doing after uh after your include
10:10 - function also so this is printing page
10:13 - info right you can see here page info
10:17 - right so this include function even if
10:22 - you provide the wrong header name or a
10:25 - header which doesn't exist it will keep
10:28 - on execu in the other codes which you uh
10:31 - write below your include function so it
10:35 - will it will not kill your page on the
10:37 - other hand when you use require it will
10:40 - kill your page right so for example I
10:43 - will
10:47 - use require for page two and include for
10:50 - page one okay so let's see page one
10:54 - first which we have include page one
10:57 - refresh it it show shows page info which
11:00 - is after my include right and let's see
11:03 - page 2. PHP page 2. PHP and
11:08 - now it killed my page and I cannot see
11:13 - the code I want to execute after this
11:15 - required function requir
11:17 - function so include and require uh works
11:22 - in the same way but but only difference
11:25 - is this which I have shown you so I hope
11:28 - you have uh learned something new this
11:30 - time please RIT comment and subscribe
11:32 - and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use include and require function in PHP so for example I have a a PHP file which is just containing um uh HTML code and which is just printing some header on the browser so I will just save it and I will S I will just browse for header.php and it's just print programming knowledge here now sometimes or most of the times you want uh some template to you know appear whenever you use uh your PHP code so for example you want to use this template which shows this header in different PHP file okay so how can we do that so for example I will make one more PHP file and I will call call it page page 1. P PHP and I will one more I will create one more PHP file and I will call it page to.php okay so I have these two PHP file and I will just quickly make this template and in here for example I want that I want to use this header file okay so I want to make this header file once and I want to use this in different PHP pages okay in different PHP files how can I do this I can use this include function and include this header file in my PHP 1 and php2 page so let's see how so what you need to do is you just need to use the keyword include and then in single codes just give the name of your uh header.php which you want to use here so my header PHP is like this header do pH PHP okay now what this code will do is it will call this header.php because all these uh three files are in same folder that's why I can call this uh for example if you want to go up one folder you can use it like this or for example you want to use uh some uh if you have this file in some other folder inside you can use it folder slash something like this but because this these all three files are in the same same folder that's why I'm not giving any path here okay otherwise you need to give relative path uh whenever you your header files are in different folder and your other functional file are in other folder okay now I can include this file in my P page one and page two like this just use include and the name of the and then I can call page one so page 1. PHP and it will give me some kind of let's see what's the error I don't see any error here so let's try it once again okay this is Page 1 Dot and I have used comma here so instead of page 1 dot now it will work so whenever we call Page One this header is called right this header and whenever we call page2.php also this header will be called right so page one and page two has the same header right so this include function enables us to use the same same template if you have in different PHP files now for example I have uh I can declare some variable variable page one and I can show some message here for example I can show we are in page one okay and we can Echo this ech e page one and in the same way I will do the same in my page two so this will be my page two variable this will be my page two variable and this will be two okay I save it and let's see what happens so we are in page 1. PHP and I can see this uh Echo message here we are in page one and whenever I call Page 2. PHP we see we are in page two right so this include function just include the header and we will be able to do our other task which are inherently uh done by page one and page two also in these uh page one and page two PHP okay or for example you decide to use these uh variables in this header file also you can do the this just like this so for example I can just declare in my header.php I can just say PHP and in here I can declare this variable which is page one right page one I just cut it from here and in my header.php and my PHP tags I can just paste it here and same I will do from my page two right so in a way I have declared all my variables in this header.php and I want to use this these variables in page one and page two I'll save it and once again run it let's see what happens so I can still get the same result here page 1. PHP P will show me page one and Page two. PHP will show me page we are in page two right so in this way you can use the include function to call files or files uh and whatever variables or whatever values are there in the files you can just import it in your PHP file just by using this include right in the same way you can use require function also so we can use instead of this include require function require and this will also work the same way that uh of include so I will just save it and when I refresh this it works same as include function right for page one also it's it works same same as include function but for example I am uh I'm including some text before this page one VAR page two variable and page one variable so for example I can just say page info and I just concatenate this in page 2. PHP and page1.php okay and I save it and whenever I use this require here okay and whenever uh this header name is for example by mistake I have missed misspell this header name so this is not a uh I mean original header or header which exist this is nonexistent header Right In Here Also in our page two we just provide the path of the header which doesn't exist and we save it and when we refresh this we see here the warning and the error and we don't see this page info message even so what this required does is whenever it sees that uh it cannot find this uh header file or this PHP file which you have provide the path of then it kills your page so whatever you write or you whatever you want to execute after this include or after this require function and if this header is not an existing it will kill your page after that okay and this same in the case of this but whenever we use include include here in page one and page two and save it see what happens I refresh it and even this is showing the error but it will execute your U messages or whatever functionality you are doing after uh after your include function also so this is printing page info right you can see here page info right so this include function even if you provide the wrong header name or a header which doesn't exist it will keep on execu in the other codes which you uh write below your include function so it will it will not kill your page on the other hand when you use require it will kill your page right so for example I will use require for page two and include for page one okay so let's see page one first which we have include page one refresh it it show shows page info which is after my include right and let's see page 2. PHP page 2. PHP and now it killed my page and I cannot see the code I want to execute after this required function requir function so include and require uh works in the same way but but only difference is this which I have shown you so I hope you have uh learned something new this time please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
