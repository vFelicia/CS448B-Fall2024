00:00 - so now today in this video what we are
00:02 - going to learn so basically we are going
00:03 - to learn about one of the more basic
00:05 - command that is cd command which means
00:07 - the change directory okay so it stands
00:10 - for change directory command
00:12 - so what we will do today uh we will
00:14 - learn about how we can change our
00:15 - directory from one to another okay now
00:18 - what i have to do i have to just
00:20 - increase the font size for you guys it
00:22 - should be visible
00:24 - uh i think yeah it's okay it's visible
00:27 - it should be
00:29 - and in the next video in window what i
00:31 - will do
00:32 - i will just open this file manager for
00:34 - your reference to show you
00:36 - how the things are working okay
00:43 - now this is our home directory here you
00:45 - can see home
00:48 - okay and right now we are also in the
00:50 - terminal we are on the home directory
00:53 - what we will do we will do this just ls
00:55 - okay
00:57 - so here you can see we are getting
00:58 - different files like different directory
01:01 - directories desktop
01:03 - downloads pictures snap videos documents
01:06 - and so on okay
01:08 - so now today in this video what we are
01:09 - going to learn about the cd command okay
01:12 - cd what it basically means series just
01:15 - stands for change directory what it will
01:18 - do it will just change your directory
01:20 - okay now our current directory is what
01:22 - it is our home okay we are at home we
01:24 - want to go on the desktop
01:27 - okay how we will do it so
01:30 - there are the two ways in which we can
01:31 - perform this action like first one is
01:33 - that we that is basically a concept of
01:36 - linux so that's why i'm telling you uh
01:38 - that is of i think one of these is
01:40 - absolute path name and the second is
01:42 - reactive path names okay
01:44 - so first we will talk about the absolute
01:46 - path i mean absolute part names what we
01:48 - do we just provide the whole
01:51 - path okay
01:54 - uh wait a minute
01:56 - i'll just provide the
01:58 - desktop path okay i want to go
02:02 - move to into the desktop directory what
02:04 - i will do cd desktop this is basically
02:05 - what absolute path names okay
02:08 - so i will just hit enter and now you can
02:10 - see i'm in the desktop
02:12 - now what i will do
02:14 - i will do ls
02:16 - okay
02:17 - so here you can see
02:19 - the file which uh
02:20 - this is also one directive in which we
02:23 - had created in the last video okay so
02:26 - this is the
02:28 - files of the
02:30 - desktop directory okay
02:32 - so this is the like one of the way in
02:35 - which we can do it like we call it as
02:38 - the absolute path names and now the next
02:40 - is reality path now what is this so
02:42 - basically relative path is work so for a
02:45 - particular notation that is dot
02:47 - then or you can say double dot okay
02:50 - so what i have to do now i have to go
02:52 - back
02:54 - now i'm in the desktop i have to go back
02:56 - okay like from
02:59 - let me answer it like from here you can
03:02 - see
03:03 - i'm in the tag uh right now we are here
03:05 - at the test okay in the desktop
03:07 - directory now what i have to go i have
03:10 - to go back in the weather in the home
03:12 - directory
03:13 - so for this what i will do i will just
03:14 - do cd dot
03:16 - dot again mac we are back okay
03:20 - we are in this particular
03:22 - window or
03:24 - we are this in this particular window
03:26 - you can see like in the home directory
03:28 - now there is also one more command uh
03:31 - which you will learn in this video like
03:33 - that is pwd
03:36 - what it does it just shows you the
03:38 - present working directory so our present
03:39 - working directory is home slash i use
03:42 - why because you ios is one of the user
03:44 - of this particular os that's why it's
03:46 - showing as you like whenever you will
03:48 - create multiple users then you will get
03:50 - your own particular home directory in
03:51 - which you will create your separate
03:52 - files and folders or anything which you
03:54 - want to create okay
03:55 - that's why it's saying home i use now
03:57 - what i will do i will move into the
04:00 - documents directory
04:03 - okay
04:03 - documents okay now
04:06 - now i am here documents so now what i
04:09 - will do i will just do pwd
04:12 - so here you can see we are getting again
04:14 - the same present working directly cd uh
04:16 - like home i use documents okay i hope
04:19 - you got the idea about how pwd is
04:21 - working how documents is working
04:23 - now what i have to do i have to just go
04:25 - back one more directory back
04:29 - one active dot dot okay we are back now
04:32 - i i will do pwd again we are at the home
04:35 - and ayush
04:36 - we are at the home directory
04:38 - now we will just hit clear button
04:41 - and here what we will do we will create
04:43 - our own structure here you can see less
04:45 - command is one of the folder
04:48 - and
04:50 - i will open up this folder and i will
04:52 - try to create
04:55 - again new folder
04:56 - that is
04:58 - test2
05:01 - okay now what we will do
05:03 - we have to come directly in the
05:05 - list command folder so how we can do it
05:07 - firstly first of all we will do ls
05:10 - okay we got the list of all the
05:12 - directors which are present in the home
05:13 - directory now where i have to go i have
05:15 - to go in the documents directory so i
05:18 - will do cd
05:21 - documents i'm just
05:22 - entering uh like after typing the duc
05:25 - and then you if you will hit tab then
05:27 - automatically it will like look like
05:29 - this document
05:30 - okay then after documents where we have
05:32 - to go
05:34 - like now i'm in documents now we'll do
05:36 - ls
05:37 - we are on the
05:38 - this documents for directory and here is
05:40 - the directory that is ls command now
05:43 - what i have to do ls command okay
05:46 - now where we are we are in the document
05:48 - ls command now what i will do i will do
05:50 - ls
05:52 - this is
05:53 - we are in the test tool
05:56 - not in the test tool like this is the
05:57 - content
05:58 - of this particular directory like ls
06:00 - command now
06:02 - i will do i will again go back and go
06:04 - into the test tool
06:06 - okay
06:08 - now let me increase that's with so it
06:10 - should be clear to you
06:11 - okay now what i will do i will just hit
06:14 - pwd
06:15 - pwd means present working ready so my
06:17 - present working right is home i use
06:19 - documents ls command and the test2
06:22 - okay now what we will do we will go back
06:24 - one by one
06:26 - cd dot dot
06:29 - we are going directly back cd dot dot
06:33 - again one directory back cd dot dot
06:36 - again one directive now we are where we
06:38 - are
06:39 - we are in the home directory now what i
06:42 - will do i will just
06:44 - give the whole path
06:46 - okay
06:47 - documents
06:48 - slash
06:50 - ls command
06:51 - slash test
06:53 - in this way you can also go in the like
06:55 - your final destination direct like
06:57 - providing the whole path in a single
06:58 - string
07:00 - okay now what i will do pwd
07:02 - so here you can see the whole
07:04 - path
07:05 - like this is same as this
07:08 - this one like when we
07:10 - went to that directly like one by one
07:12 - okay when we were doing one by one then
07:14 - we were all getting these results and
07:16 - also when we are doing like in a single
07:18 - string then also we are getting the same
07:20 - result i hope you got the idea about how
07:22 - the cd change direct working okay
07:26 - let me clear this
07:28 - now uh there is also one more shortcut
07:30 - to go directly in the home directory
07:31 - that is cd
07:34 - this till it will directly go into the
07:36 - home directory
07:37 - that is ls okay or we when we will do
07:40 - pwd
07:41 - you will get that particular window
07:45 - okay so i hope you got this uh how the
07:47 - things are working
07:49 - and this is all about the cd like change
07:51 - directory command okay see this stands
07:53 - for change directory
07:56 - okay i hope it is clear now so
07:59 - we will meet in the next video with uh
08:01 - like we will create some folders and
08:03 - files and all these things we will talk
08:04 - about in the next video so that's all
08:06 - for today's video and thank you for
08:08 - watching so we'll meet next one okay
