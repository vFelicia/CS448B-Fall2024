00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge and this is the
00:04 - third video of five-part video series on
00:07 - how to create user registration form
00:10 - using PHP so in the previous tutorial we
00:13 - have styled our user registration form
00:15 - so as you can see we have improved the
00:18 - looks of our form and we also modified
00:22 - our PHP code to capture the values if
00:25 - the user submitted the form so in this
00:30 - lecture we're going to implement the
00:33 - database connection and we will create a
00:36 - new database that will hold all the
00:38 - information of the user accounts so
00:42 - let's go ahead and open up our browser
00:43 - let's try to use the local host PHP
00:47 - myadmin
00:52 - okay click on the new link and for the
01:01 - database name type in user accounts and
01:06 - click on create let's create a new table
01:11 - with the name users and for the number
01:16 - of columns we have I think six one
01:21 - problem for the ID which is auto
01:23 - increment the first name the last name
01:27 - the email the phone number and the last
01:30 - is the password so six and click on go
01:39 - so for this one the first column is ID
01:43 - and type in with Auto increment option
01:47 - should be enabled the second one is
01:52 - first name with a type of bar chart and
01:57 - the land let's say 100 and next one is
02:04 - last name type bar char and 100 and I
02:10 - think it's email
02:13 - and let's set it also to for char and
02:19 - the next one is the phone number should
02:24 - be virtual also with the length of 50
02:29 - and the password for char I think 32
02:37 - will be enough but let's just put it 250
02:41 - or set it to 50 and click on save so now
02:50 - we have our database which is the user
02:53 - accounts and read the table users with 6
02:58 - fields which is ID first name last name
03:00 - email phone number and password I think
03:05 - it's high time for us to define or
03:08 - create our config dot PHP so let's open
03:13 - up our config that PHP file and connect
03:16 - our database to our PHP code so here
03:20 - inside our config that page p5 we need
03:22 - to open our PHP tag and define 3
03:29 - variables which is for our DB user which
03:33 - is root and DB password ready be passed
03:43 - in my case it's empty and the B name
03:48 - equals or see user accounts okay so
03:55 - based on these variables we need to
03:57 - define a new object of the video class
04:03 - open close parenthesis so inside here we
04:07 - need to type in MySQL and column and
04:16 - then host equals localhost and semicolon
04:25 - after that DB name equals we need to
04:31 - append the DB name variable that we have
04:35 - defined above and a pen another string
04:42 - which is for the corruptor set of our
04:46 - database which is utf-8 and after that
04:55 - we need to pass in the DB user variable
05:00 - and also the DB password variable or the
05:06 - DB pass variable and let us set an
05:11 - attribute to this DB object below so DB
05:18 - set attribute and open close parenthesis
05:24 - and video
05:30 - attr and remoter
05:34 - ya air mode and video error mode should
05:44 - be exception so this will give us more
05:49 - information if we encounter problems
05:52 - when we're using the DB object later on
05:56 - so with that we're now ready to use this
05:59 - DB object into our registration dot PHP
06:04 - so open up the registration that PHP
06:07 - file and let's include the config dot
06:13 - PHP into this file so require once the
06:20 - config HB okay and make sure that you
06:27 - save the config dot PHP file
06:30 - so inside this if statement we can now
06:33 - use the DB object that we define in
06:36 - config data HP so all we have to do now
06:40 - is type in the SQL of course our first
06:46 - SQL will be insert into users and we
06:53 - just need to list the fields which are
06:59 - first name last name email the phone
07:05 - number and of course the password with
07:09 - values by close and question mark
07:16 - question mark question mark question
07:19 - mark one two three four
07:21 - I think it's five right five and
07:29 - statement for our insert st empty insert
07:33 - it was a debate object that we have
07:37 - defined in config dot PHP and prepare
07:41 - force supply the SQL statement and let's
07:48 - just delete this line so after this is
07:51 - the empty insert let's define result and
07:56 - st empty insert and I'm intoxicated and
08:04 - of course we need to supply the array of
08:07 - the fields are the values coming from
08:11 - the form which is the first name which
08:16 - is the first name last name email and
08:22 - phone number and password
08:26 - so if result is true open closed curly
08:31 - braces echo
08:34 - successfully say hey else let go there
08:45 - were errors while saving the data save
08:53 - your file and open up the browser
08:57 - refresh the page and let's try to input
09:02 - some names here example Jane the last
09:10 - name though
09:11 - and email address will be Jane Doe at
09:15 - gmail.com phone number plus six two
09:21 - three nine eight five six just random
09:26 - numbers okay and password Jane Doe and
09:33 - click on the sign up button cool now it
09:40 - says successfully save but let's check
09:44 - our database or the PHP myadmin to see
09:48 - if the data has gone through okay so
09:55 - browse let's just click on this browse
09:59 - and you can see we now have the first
10:03 - record which is the Jane the first name
10:06 - Jane last name tho email address Jane
10:08 - Doe at gmail.com phone number and of
10:12 - course the password which is Jane Doe
10:14 - okay so I think our insert method or
10:20 - insert logic is good but there's a lot
10:25 - of room for improvement so for example
10:28 - we want the form not to reload every
10:31 - time we submit the information and also
10:34 - the feedback if successful or not yes I
10:40 - think it's not that good or not that
10:44 - good looking so we will implement the
10:48 - sweet alert library to replace this
10:51 - boring feedback that we have here
10:54 - alright guys thank you for watching and
10:57 - in the next video we'll work on jQuery
11:00 - and sweet alerts thanks
11:11 - you
