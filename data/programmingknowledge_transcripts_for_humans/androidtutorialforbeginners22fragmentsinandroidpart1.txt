00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - what are fragments in Android and how we
00:10 - can use fragments and we will also see
00:13 - an example how to use fragments so that
00:16 - we can understand it in a better way so
00:20 - first of all what is a fragment a fact
00:24 - fragment represents a behavior or a
00:28 - portion of user interface in an activity
00:32 - that means we use fragment inside an
00:37 - Android activity and you can combine
00:41 - multiple fragments in a single activity
00:44 - to build a multi-pane user interface and
00:48 - you can reuse a fragment in multiple
00:52 - activities so I will show you a picture
00:56 - which will you know give a demonstration
01:00 - how a fragment can work but let's see
01:04 - what is a an exact you know advantage of
01:09 - fragment so the greatest advantage of
01:13 - fragment is that it simplifies the task
01:16 - of creating UIs for multiple screen
01:20 - sizes and our activity can contain
01:25 - number of fragments okay so let me give
01:30 - you an example so that you can
01:33 - understand it in a better way this
01:36 - picture I have taken from Android comm
01:40 - so you can also see this picture and in
01:43 - here you can see this fragment example
01:47 - for tablet and handset okay and in here
01:52 - you can see in the tablet example 2
01:57 - fragments fragment a and fragment B
02:00 - because tablet screen is bigger so you
02:04 - can you know adjust or you can insert
02:08 - two fragments inside a one activity here
02:13 - okay so this is a tablet screen and
02:17 - which contains an activity and inside
02:21 - here there are two fragment one fragment
02:25 - is this one this block which is screen
02:27 - here another fragment is this one and
02:30 - this is something like whenever you
02:34 - click a button you will be able to see
02:36 - the corresponding screen related to the
02:40 - button action right so you when you
02:43 - click some button for some image for
02:47 - example some landscape image you click
02:49 - landscape button you will be able to see
02:52 - landscape image or some person's image
02:55 - or some country or regions image when
02:59 - you click them right so in this tablet
03:02 - example there are two fragment inside
03:05 - our activity and whenever you you know
03:11 - click these buttons one fragment you
03:14 - will be able to see the corresponding
03:16 - response in other fragment in the same
03:20 - way in because handsets screen are small
03:24 - so here you have activity a and fragment
03:27 - a inside this activity and flag activity
03:31 - V B which contains fragment B so
03:34 - whenever you click some button in
03:37 - fragment in in activity a you will be
03:41 - able to see this activity V inside this
03:46 - fragment or active fragment B inside
03:49 - this activity right so the basic idea is
03:53 - the reusability of your code because you
03:58 - can use multiple fragments so you can
04:02 - create a fragment and reuse it in
04:05 - multiple activities and basically if you
04:09 - make fragments it will you know reduce
04:12 - your code writing and you know you will
04:16 - be you know able to write a really good
04:19 - code now let's take an example
04:23 - so what I am going to do is I'm going to
04:27 - create a new project for this fragment
04:34 - example and in here I will name my
04:37 - project as fragment example and in here
04:45 - we'll choose the default us you know
04:49 - minimum SDK and in here note that we can
04:55 - use fragment above API 11 so it's better
05:00 - to use API 11 or above to use fragment
05:05 - in a better way so I will use API 11 or
05:08 - Android 3.0 which is hunting comp and
05:12 - then I will click Next and I will create
05:16 - a blanket activity click Next and I will
05:21 - leave them as default and click finish
05:29 - so now our blank project is created and
05:34 - we can see this hollow world textview
05:37 - here I'm going to delete it and what I'm
05:41 - going to do is I'm going to go to my
05:43 - text view of this activity main.xml file
05:47 - and instead of relative layout we are
05:52 - going to use linear layout here so what
05:55 - I'm going to do is I'm going to just
05:57 - change this lil relative layout to
06:00 - linear layout okay now when you change
06:07 - this layout here from relative layout to
06:12 - linear layout you will be able to see a
06:15 - error here and this thing's nothing but
06:21 - you know whenever you add some child to
06:25 - your activity or then this error can
06:29 - occur so for fixing this error what you
06:34 - need to do is you just need to go to the
06:36 - property here and in here go to the
06:39 - property called orientation and change
06:41 - the orientation to vertical and this
06:45 - error will be gone okay because our
06:49 - layout is linear okay now what we are
06:53 - going to do is we are going to take two
06:55 - buttons and we are going to you know
07:04 - listen for this button click events and
07:07 - we will try to open two different
07:10 - fragments using these two buttons okay
07:14 - so I will name the rename these buttons
07:19 - as for example fragment one and the
07:27 - second button I will a name as
07:33 - fragment to okay and I will just change
07:37 - the property layout with property of
07:40 - these two fragments to fill or match
07:44 - parent okay so they cover the whole
07:47 - width now what I'm going to do is I'm
07:51 - going to add some fragment to our
07:54 - project so go to your app folder and
07:59 - inside this app folder go to resource
08:01 - directory and inside this go to this
08:04 - layout folder where your activity
08:07 - underscore main dot XML file is there
08:10 - now just click this layout folder and
08:14 - right-click it and create new and we are
08:18 - going to create a new fragment which is
08:20 - a blank fragment and we will name this
08:24 - fragment as for example fragment one
08:29 - okay
08:30 - fragment 1 or fragment one like this and
08:35 - I will click finish in a same way I will
08:39 - once again add a second fragment so I
08:42 - will right click on layout new fragment
08:45 - blank fragment and I will name it as
08:48 - fragment to okay fragment - so this will
08:58 - create two fragments for us this
09:01 - fragment is the fragment number two and
09:04 - this fragment is fragment number one
09:06 - okay
09:07 - now let's change the background color of
09:11 - these two fragments so that we can
09:13 - recognize the fragments so for example
09:17 - this fragment I will just change the
09:21 - background color to a little bit reddish
09:24 - let's see what color we can choose for
09:27 - fragment one for example green okay so
09:31 - that we can recognize these two
09:33 - fragments okay now what I am going to do
09:36 - is here you will be able to see inside
09:39 - your Java folder there are two Java file
09:42 - will be created for fragment one and
09:44 - fragment
09:45 - that our fragment one dot Java I am
09:49 - going to click this fragment one dot
09:51 - Java file and in here you will be able
09:54 - to see this all code is created for you
09:57 - by you know Android studio for you ok so
10:03 - what I'm going to do is to make things
10:05 - simple I will just remove all the code
10:09 - and I will just leave one method here
10:13 - and this method will be on create view
10:18 - method and all the other method methods
10:21 - I will delete okay so there is only one
10:26 - method I am going to leave which is on
10:29 - create and we will do the same for
10:34 - fragment two also so we will click
10:37 - fragment to the Java file and we will
10:39 - delete all the code other than on create
10:43 - view method so delete all the code
10:48 - inside this class and just leave this on
10:52 - create view method okay now what I'm
10:58 - going to do is I am going to once again
11:00 - go to my activity underscore main dot
11:03 - XML file and I will try to add this
11:07 - fragment in this remaining space okay
11:11 - so I will go to text and in here I am
11:15 - going to add this fragment so just add a
11:19 - fragment and this will create a fragment
11:24 - for you and you can choose which width
11:28 - and layout height you want so I want to
11:32 - add match parent for the height and
11:41 - width okay now you can add some more
11:45 - properties to this this fragment like ID
11:50 - so I'm going to add some ID in order to
11:55 - save time I will just copy and paste
11:57 - this
11:58 - and ID for example we will name a
12:03 - fragment place for example ok now you
12:11 - can also add the default fragment here
12:14 - so that whenever we will run our
12:17 - activity some default fragment should be
12:21 - set inside this fragment ok so what we
12:26 - are going to do we are going to add a
12:29 - default fragment to it so just write
12:33 - android android name and we will add a
12:41 - default fragment here so inside this
12:43 - these double quotes go to your fragment
12:47 - 1 dot XML file in here and just copy the
12:54 - name of this fragment from here or
12:57 - context comm dot example dot whatever is
13:01 - the name of your fragment so just copy
13:03 - this from here and go to your activity
13:07 - underscore main dot XML file and paste
13:11 - it under Android colon name ok now this
13:16 - will create a fragment in your in your
13:22 - activity now we are almost done with our
13:28 - design and what we want to do is we just
13:32 - want to write the code so that whenever
13:34 - we click a button a fragment related to
13:39 - that button will be displayed in this
13:43 - fragment area okay so there is a
13:48 - abstract class called fragment manager
13:51 - we use to you know a work with fragments
13:57 - so this fragment class was fragment
14:01 - manager class or what is this so to
14:05 - manage fragments we need a fragment
14:08 - manager this is an abstract class
14:11 - Android that helped us to handle
14:14 - transaction between fragments okay and
14:18 - we also are going to use a fragment
14:23 - transaction class and these transaction
14:27 - or with with transaction we mean a
14:30 - sequence of steps like add replace or
14:35 - remove fragments okay
14:38 - so let's add some code to our main
14:43 - activity dot Java file
14:52 - you

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on android app development for beginners and in this video we will see what are fragments in Android and how we can use fragments and we will also see an example how to use fragments so that we can understand it in a better way so first of all what is a fragment a fact fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an activity that means we use fragment inside an Android activity and you can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multipane user interface and you can reuse a fragment in multiple activities so I will show you a picture which will you know give a demonstration how a fragment can work but let's see what is a an exact you know advantage of fragment so the greatest advantage of fragment is that it simplifies the task of creating UIs for multiple screen sizes and our activity can contain number of fragments okay so let me give you an example so that you can understand it in a better way this picture I have taken from Android comm so you can also see this picture and in here you can see this fragment example for tablet and handset okay and in here you can see in the tablet example 2 fragments fragment a and fragment B because tablet screen is bigger so you can you know adjust or you can insert two fragments inside a one activity here okay so this is a tablet screen and which contains an activity and inside here there are two fragment one fragment is this one this block which is screen here another fragment is this one and this is something like whenever you click a button you will be able to see the corresponding screen related to the button action right so you when you click some button for some image for example some landscape image you click landscape button you will be able to see landscape image or some person's image or some country or regions image when you click them right so in this tablet example there are two fragment inside our activity and whenever you you know click these buttons one fragment you will be able to see the corresponding response in other fragment in the same way in because handsets screen are small so here you have activity a and fragment a inside this activity and flag activity V B which contains fragment B so whenever you click some button in fragment in in activity a you will be able to see this activity V inside this fragment or active fragment B inside this activity right so the basic idea is the reusability of your code because you can use multiple fragments so you can create a fragment and reuse it in multiple activities and basically if you make fragments it will you know reduce your code writing and you know you will be you know able to write a really good code now let's take an example so what I am going

note that we can use fragment above API 11 so it's better to use API 11 or above to use fragment in a better way so I will use API 11 or Android 3.0 which is hunting comp and then I will click Next and I will create a blanket activity click Next and I will leave them as default and click finish so now our blank project is created and we can see this hollow world textview here I'm going to delete it and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my text view of this activity main.xml file and instead of relative layout we are going to use linear layout here so what I'm going to do is I'm going

whole width now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add some fragment to our project so go to your app folder and inside this app folder go to resource directory and inside this go to this layout folder where your activity underscore main dot XML file is there now just click this layout folder and rightclick it and create new and we are going to create a new fragment which is a blank fragment and we will name this fragment as for example fragment one okay fragment 1 or fragment one like this and I will click finish in a same way I will once again add a second fragment so I will right click on layout new fragment blank fragment and I will name it as fragment to okay fragment so this will create two fragments for us this fragment is the fragment number two and this fragment is fragment

this method will be on create view method and all the other method methods I will delete okay so there is only one method I am going to leave which is on create and we will do the same for fragment two also so we will click fragment to the Java file and we will delete all the code other than on create view method so delete all the code inside this class and just leave this on create view method okay now what I'm going to do is I am going to once again go to my activity underscore main dot XML file and I will try to add this fragment in this remaining space okay so I will go to text and in here I am going to add this fragment so just add a fragment and this will create a fragment for you and you can choose which width and layout height you want so I want to add match parent for the height and width okay now you can add some more properties to this this fragment like ID so I'm going to add some ID in order to save time I will just copy and paste this and ID for example we will name a fragment place for example ok now you can also add the default fragment here so that whenever we will run our activity some default fragment should be set inside this fragment ok so what we are going to do we are going to add a default fragment to it so just write android android name and we will add a default fragment here so inside this these double quotes go to your fragment 1 dot XML file in here and just copy the name of this fragment from here or context comm dot example dot whatever is the name of your fragment so just copy this from here and go to your activity underscore main dot XML file and paste it under Android colon name ok now this will create a fragment in your in your activity now we are almost done with our design and what we want to do is we just want to write
