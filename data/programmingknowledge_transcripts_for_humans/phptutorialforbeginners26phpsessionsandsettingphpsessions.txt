00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - sessions and what are sessions and how
00:07 - to set sessions in PHP so let's see what
00:12 - is a session a session is a way to store
00:15 - information in the form of variable to
00:18 - be used across multiple Pages or in
00:21 - other words a PHP session variable is
00:24 - used to store information about or
00:28 - changes change SE settings for a user
00:32 - session so session variable holds the
00:36 - information about one single user and
00:40 - are available all to all the pages in
00:44 - one application so I will give you an
00:46 - example for example uh you log in to
00:50 - some website for example Facebook or
00:54 - Gmail and this browser remembers that
00:58 - you are logged in even if you close the
01:01 - page uh the browsers remembers that uh
01:04 - you are logged in so there is a session
01:08 - which stores a single user
01:10 - information uh about the about the user
01:14 - or related to the user uh this is called
01:19 - this can be saved in the form of
01:20 - sessions and can be used in multiple
01:24 - Pages all across your one application or
01:27 - one browser for example so I will give
01:31 - you an example first of all how to
01:34 - declare session in PHP
01:37 - so in PHP first of all to start a
01:41 - session or to use a session we need to
01:45 - use this function called session start
01:48 - so first thing to start a session is to
01:51 - use this function and this is a way of
01:54 - telling PHP that in this page we are
01:56 - going to use a session so just uh be
02:00 - ready for it okay now we can declare a
02:05 - session variable which is a super Global
02:07 - variable which is already reserved in
02:09 - PHP and it's declared like this dollar
02:14 - underscore in capital
02:19 - session and it takes a argument okay and
02:25 - you can set any value in the session for
02:29 - example you want to
02:31 - set for example I have a student uh
02:35 - student info page okay and I want to uh
02:39 - set the name of name or name of the
02:43 - student is equal
02:45 - to mark for example and it should be
02:50 - in this format okay and I want to
02:56 - set the student age and student uh
03:00 - student weight for example okay so here
03:04 - I can set
03:05 - age
03:11 - and wait okay and eight for example 21
03:18 - waight 45 okay and this should be a
03:22 - dollar sign
03:25 - here so how you can set sessions you
03:29 - just need to use this keyword UND or
03:32 - dollar undor session keyword and in the
03:34 - square bracket you can set the value of
03:37 - sessions this is the key for the session
03:40 - and this is the value for the session
03:42 - and now once you open this page your uh
03:48 - your application will remember that you
03:50 - have set already uh name is equal to
03:53 - Mark and age is equal to 21 and weight
03:56 - is equal to um weight is equal to 45 and
03:59 - for example I can
04:02 - echo echo done for example so that we
04:06 - know that we are done Echo done and I
04:10 - save it and I go to my
04:14 - browser and I open this session and I
04:17 - can see done so once I have I can see
04:20 - done now the sessions are set so the
04:24 - session for name is set is equal to Mark
04:26 - session for age is equal to set uh is
04:29 - equal to 20 one set and weight also
04:31 - session for weight also set now for
04:35 - example I made make some other page or
04:39 - other PHP page or code and in this I
04:45 - will save
04:47 - as
04:50 - view.php
04:52 - okay and what this will do
04:56 - is it will pH HP
05:00 - p and in here we want to call the
05:05 - session so generally in the earlier
05:08 - videos I have shown you or I have uh
05:11 - taught you that you need to use
05:15 - include to include this file okay
05:19 - include other file for example I want to
05:21 - use the variable from session.php I want
05:24 - to I need to include this session. pH
05:30 - P here and then only I will be able to
05:33 - uh use this these variables from the
05:36 - session right but uh not from the
05:39 - session but from the file but
05:42 - because session definition says that
05:46 - once you set the session you can use
05:49 - this session throughout your application
05:52 - in all pages so you don't even need to
05:55 - include this you can directly call uh
05:59 - call uh those session like this so for
06:02 - example I can just call this name is
06:06 - equal to Dollar
06:11 - underscore in
06:13 - capital session and I can call the
06:17 - session the same session like this so
06:20 - the session key for name is name just
06:24 - copy it and paste it here and in the
06:26 - same way I can call age and weight okay
06:31 - so I can just write age these are the
06:33 - user defined variable I'm I'm declaring
06:36 - them so you can uh you know declare any
06:39 - variable name here and
06:44 - wait and I just need to use the same key
06:48 - for session okay so
06:53 - wait and I can Echo all these names like
06:57 - this so e
07:00 - Echo for example I can Echo
07:04 - name name right and for example I give a
07:09 - break
07:18 - here and I
07:21 - can Echo the weight and the age also
07:27 - like this weight and age so just notice
07:32 - here that I haven't called anything from
07:34 - session.php right I haven't included
07:37 - this file here but according to the
07:40 - definition if session is set once it can
07:43 - be used in other pages in one
07:44 - application right so I will just save
07:47 - this and I will call here view.php
07:54 - right view.php and press enter and let's
08:00 - see what's the problem
08:02 - here yeah so we haven't uh started our
08:06 - session with this one right so we always
08:09 - remember that whenever you want to set a
08:12 - session or use session you just need to
08:15 - use this okay in every of your
08:18 - page so once again I will go to my
08:20 - browser and search for or browse
08:24 - for view.php and now I can see
08:30 - the name value of name and the value of
08:36 - age and the weight right so in this way
08:40 - you can set sessions in
08:42 - PHP and S sessions uh as I already told
08:47 - you you can use it with uh some login
08:50 - information for example you want to um
08:54 - you know if the user logs in you want
08:56 - him or or you want your applic to make
09:00 - the user logged in until unless he logs
09:03 - out himself and he should be logged in
09:06 - unless and until he should log out from
09:08 - other Pages or what whatever so in this
09:13 - way sessions work in
09:15 - PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video
09:18 - please wait comment and subscribe and
09:19 - bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use sessions and what are sessions and how to set sessions in PHP so let's see what is a session a session is a way to store information in the form of variable to be used across multiple Pages or in other words a PHP session variable is used to store information about or changes change SE settings for a user session so session variable holds the information about one single user and are available all to all the pages in one application so I will give you an example for example uh you log in to some website for example Facebook or Gmail and this browser remembers that you are logged in even if you close the page uh the browsers remembers that uh you are logged in so there is a session which stores a single user information uh about the about the user or related to the user uh this is called this can be saved in the form of sessions and can be used in multiple Pages all across your one application or one browser for example so I will give you an example first of all how to declare session in PHP so in PHP first of all to start a session or to use a session we need to use this function called session start so first thing to start a session is to use this function and this is a way of telling PHP that in this page we are going to use a session so just uh be ready for it okay now we can declare a session variable which is a super Global variable which is already reserved in PHP and it's declared like this dollar underscore in capital session and it takes a argument okay and you can set any value in the session for example you want to set for example I have a student uh student info page okay and I want to uh set the name of name or name of the student is equal to mark for example and it should be in this format okay and I want to set the student age and student uh student weight for example okay so here I can set age and wait okay and eight for example 21 waight 45 okay and this should be a dollar sign here so how you can set sessions you just need to use this keyword UND or dollar undor session keyword and in the square bracket you can set the value of sessions this is the key for the session and this is the value for the session and now once you open this page your uh your application will remember that you have set already uh name is equal to Mark and age is equal to 21 and weight is equal to um weight is equal to 45 and for example I can echo echo done for example so that we know that we are done Echo done and I save it and I go to my browser and I open this session and I can see done so once I have I can see done now the sessions are set so the session for name is set is equal to Mark session for age is equal to set uh is equal to 20 one set and weight also session for weight also set now for example I made make some other page or other PHP page or code and in this I will save as view.php okay and what this will do is it will pH HP p and in here we want to call the session so generally in the earlier videos I have shown you or I have uh taught you that you need to use include to include this file okay include other file for example I want to use the variable from session.php I want to I need to include this session. pH P here and then only I will be able to uh use this these variables from the session right but uh not from the session but from the file but because session definition says that once you set the session you can use this session throughout your application in all pages so you don't even need to include this you can directly call uh call uh those session like this so for example I can just call this name is equal to Dollar underscore in capital session and I can call the session the same session like this so the session key for name is name just copy it and paste it here and in the same way I can call age and weight okay so I can just write age these are the user defined variable I'm I'm declaring them so you can uh you know declare any variable name here and wait and I just need to use the same key for session okay so wait and I can Echo all these names like this so e Echo for example I can Echo name name right and for example I give a break here and I can Echo the weight and the age also like this weight and age so just notice here that I haven't called anything from session.php right I haven't included this file here but according to the definition if session is set once it can be used in other pages in one application right so I will just save this and I will call here view.php right view.php and press enter and let's see what's the problem here yeah so we haven't uh started our session with this one right so we always remember that whenever you want to set a session or use session you just need to use this okay in every of your page so once again I will go to my browser and search for or browse for view.php and now I can see the name value of name and the value of age and the weight right so in this way you can set sessions in PHP and S sessions uh as I already told you you can use it with uh some login information for example you want to um you know if the user logs in you want him or or you want your applic to make the user logged in until unless he logs out himself and he should be logged in unless and until he should log out from other Pages or what whatever so in this way sessions work in PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
