00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux come online tutorial for beginners
00:04 - and in this video we will see how we can
00:06 - use date command in Linux the date
00:09 - command is used to print out or change
00:12 - the value of system time and date
00:14 - information so the date command is
00:17 - really simple you can just use date it's
00:20 - going to display you the current date
00:23 - and time okay
00:25 - and when you use - s flag with date so
00:30 - you can just use date - s and with this
00:35 - - s after this whatever date and time
00:40 - you will set in string as a string it
00:44 - will be set as a system time which is
00:46 - going to be set here as your system time
00:49 - and you will see that time in your
00:52 - system time okay for example I want to
00:55 - set the update something like this for
00:58 - example this date is 20th November 2003
01:03 - 12 o'clock 48 minutes like this okay so
01:09 - it's going to set the date to November
01:12 - 20 2003 12:48 p.m. right so in this way
01:19 - you can set the date but right now I am
01:21 - NOT going to give this command because I
01:23 - don't want to change the date of my
01:25 - system but this is the flag you can use
01:28 - to set the date now there are some other
01:32 - flags which you can use with this date
01:34 - command to format the date in which way
01:38 - you want to see the date for example so
01:42 - I have a little list here I'm going to
01:45 - show you this list and these are the
01:47 - flags you can use with your date command
01:50 - and then you will be able to format your
01:54 - you know date for example I want to
01:58 - display first of all I will write this
02:00 - plus symbol and then this modulus symbol
02:04 - and I can see here that small H is used
02:10 - for the month
02:13 - in the you know in the character format
02:16 - right so what I'm going to do is first
02:20 - of all I am going to just use D for date
02:23 - of the month small D then modulus small
02:28 - edge for the month abbreviation and then
02:33 - I'm going to use modulus Y for year okay
02:39 - like this and then press Enter
02:42 - and it shows me the date in this format
02:45 - so today at the time of making this
02:47 - video it's for January 2017 I can do
02:52 - more with this so for example I can just
02:56 - make it a string like this and then I
03:00 - can add for example this minus symbol in
03:05 - between the date a month and year it's
03:09 - going to format this date like this or I
03:13 - can do forward slash here instead of
03:17 - this so whatever way you want to show
03:20 - the date it's going to show the date in
03:22 - that format right and these are some of
03:25 - the flags you can use with the date
03:28 - command now the date command is really a
03:33 - you know vas command and you can you do
03:36 - lots of knots of thing with the date
03:38 - come on so let's see the man page and
03:42 - let's see how you know what else you can
03:45 - do with the date command so I am going
03:47 - to just write man date and press Enter
03:51 - and you can see there are so many flags
03:54 - for example this - file for file flag
03:59 - and are for reference and you can see s
04:04 - for setting the time as a string and you
04:08 - can see all these you know small formats
04:12 - you can see unlisted here so H is same
04:18 - as B and you can see hours or you will
04:25 - be able to see Y also
04:27 - for a year so you can see here and
04:31 - capital y for a year
04:34 - so just go through this man page and you
04:38 - know see how you can use this date
04:41 - command because it's a really you know
04:45 - vast command and in one video it will be
04:50 - not possible to you know cover all the
04:52 - flags you know with this lead come on
04:55 - so I will suggest you to read this man
04:58 - page whenever you want to write and the
05:03 - last example I am going to give you the
05:06 - date and time for example so you want to
05:09 - print the date and time you can just do
05:12 - something like this so in the string
05:14 - format itself you can just write this so
05:18 - just don't forget to add this plus
05:21 - before your date format and then you can
05:25 - add a string any string and these are
05:29 - you know flags modulus MOH or hour or
05:33 - you know capital m for minute capital s
05:37 - 4 seconds and then when you give this
05:40 - come on you can see it prints the date
05:43 - first and then the time okay so in this
05:46 - way you can use a date command in Linux
05:49 - I hope you have enjoyed this video

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux come online tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how we can use date command in Linux the date command is used to print out or change the value of system time and date information so the date command is really simple you can just use date it's going to display you the current date and time okay and when you use s flag with date so you can just use date s and with this s after this whatever date and time you will set in string as a string it will be set as a system time which is going to be set here as your system time and you will see that time in your system time okay for example I want to set the update something like this for example this date is 20th November 2003 12 o'clock 48 minutes like this okay so it's going to set the date to November 20 2003 1248 p.m. right so in this way you can set the date but right now I am NOT going to give this command because I don't want to change the date of my system but this is the flag you can use to set the date now there are some other flags which you can use with this date command to format the date in which way you want to see the date for example so I have a little list here I'm going to show you this list and these are the flags you can use with your date command and then you will be able to format your you know date for example I want to display first of all I will write this plus symbol and then this modulus symbol and I can see here that small H is used for the month in the you know in the character format right so what I'm going to do is first of all I am going to just use D for date of the month small D then modulus small edge for the month abbreviation and then I'm going to use modulus Y for year okay like this and then press Enter and it shows me the date in this format so today at the time of making this video it's for January 2017 I can do more with this so for example I can just make it a string like this and then I can add for example this minus symbol in between the date a month and year it's going to format this date like this or I can do forward slash here instead of this so whatever way you want to show the date it's going to show the date in that format right and these are some of the flags you can use with the date command now the date command is really a you know vas command and you can you do lots of knots of thing with the date come on so let's see the man page and let's see how you know what else you can do with the date command so I am going to just write man date and press Enter and you can see there are so many flags for example this file for file flag and are for reference and you can see s for setting the time as a string and you can see all these you know small formats you can see unlisted here so H is same as B and you can see hours or you will be able to see Y also for a year so you can see here and capital y for a year so just go through this man page and you know see how you can use this date command because it's a really you know vast command and in one video it will be not possible to you know cover all the flags you know with this lead come on so I will suggest you to read this man page whenever you want to write and the last example I am going to give you the date and time for example so you want to print the date and time you can just do something like this so in the string format itself you can just write this so just don't forget to add this plus before your date format and then you can add a string any string and these are you know flags modulus MOH or hour or you know capital m for minute capital s 4 seconds and then when you give this come on you can see it prints the date first and then the time okay so in this way you can use a date command in Linux I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate and subscribe and bye for now
