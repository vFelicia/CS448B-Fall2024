02:46 - dpkg minus I and then my team viewer
02:50 - unor Linux so I will

03:16 - process it will install in some seconds
03:20 - in your system and once it's installed
03:23 - you need to go to this Dash home so
03:28 - click Dash home
03:33 - and in this Dash home in the search just
03:36 - search for team viewer and you can see
03:40 - here team viewer 9 if you want to use
03:44 - team viewer frequently just drag and

03:50 - double click it to open Team
03:54 - Viewer and it will open Team view in
03:56 - your
03:57 - system and for the first time time when
04:00 - you install team View and when you want
04:02 - to run it you need to accept this
04:05 - license agreement so if you agree with
04:07 - the license just click accept license
04:11 - and now team viewer is working on your
04:13 - system so now for example I want to
04:16 - check uh whether my team viewer is
04:19 - really working so this open to operating
04:22 - system I'm running on a virtual machine
04:25 - and I have Windows 7 host machine
04:30 - and in this Windows 7 host machine I
04:32 - also have Team Viewer there also right
04:36 - so for example I want to connect this
04:39 - guest machine which is a open to machine
04:43 - to my host machine machine which is uh
04:46 - Windows machine and I want to operate
04:50 - this Linux from Team Viewer using this
04:54 - Windows 7 host machine so I will open my
04:58 - team viewer in Windows first and I will
05:01 - just give the ID to connect to the team
05:05 - viewer which is the same as uh my open
05:09 - to operating system team viewer ID and I
05:12 - will click connect to
05:19 - partner and it's going to give me a
05:24 - prompt to give the
05:28 - password
05:34 - and now it's uh my Windows host team
05:37 - viewer is asking for the password from
05:41 - the team viewer for uh this Ubuntu so
05:44 - this is 2071 for example so I will
05:49 - write the password and I will say log
05:58 - on
06:00 - and in some moment you will be able to
06:03 - see
06:06 - the team
06:10 - viewer virtual machine in your team
06:14 - viewer
06:20 - terminal so now I
06:23 - have my team viewer virtual machine and
06:26 - I have my other virtual machine which
06:29 - I'm running so this is running on team
06:32 - view I will just minimize it a little
06:37 - and you can see both the screen at the
06:39 - same time this is my actual virtual
06:42 - machine and this is my team viewer so
06:47 - whatever I do here in my team viewer I
06:50 - want to for
06:52 - example
06:55 - minimize or close this web browser it
06:59 - Clos
