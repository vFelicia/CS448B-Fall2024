00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:06 - how we can use CD command in Linux CD
00:10 - command we can use to change the current
00:13 - working directory in Linux so let's see
00:16 - how we can use it so first of all I'm
00:19 - going to press control alt T to open my
00:23 - terminal and then I'm going to uh just
00:27 - use uh the command so so first of all
00:30 - let's see the syntax of a CD so you can
00:34 - just use CD as it is and it can be used
00:38 - with the directory name also so you can
00:41 - just write there here right so first of
00:46 - all whenever you give the CD command as
00:49 - it is it's going to uh land you in the
00:53 - current home directory right so you see
00:58 - it's the home whatever you open whenever
01:01 - you uh open the terminal for the first
01:03 - time it'll uh you know land you there
01:07 - right and then for example you want to
01:11 - uh go to somewhere for example we want
01:14 - to uh change directory to the root
01:17 - directory as we have seen in the first
01:20 - video root directory is this forward
01:22 - slash and then press enter and now we
01:25 - are in the root directory and you know
01:29 - you are in new root directory by this
01:31 - forward slash here and uh by default you
01:35 - have this still which is a home yeah
01:38 - right so first of all let's see in which
01:41 - directory we are so we are uh in root
01:45 - directory so we will just give PWD and
01:48 - see if we are in that directory or not
01:51 - so you can see we are in root directory
01:54 - right now once again if you give uh CD
01:57 - and then this uh till the symbol then
02:01 - this means your home directory home
02:04 - directory is nothing but your home slash
02:08 - username right so once again I give this
02:11 - command and then once again I give the
02:14 - PWD command and you can see we are in
02:18 - now our home directory right so This Ti
02:22 - can be used also with CD Command right
02:26 - now there is a command something like CD
02:31 - dot dot and it means we want to go to
02:35 - The Parent Directory of the current
02:38 - working directory so for example our
02:41 - current working directory is
02:44 - home/ programming knowledge which is my
02:47 - username so when I give a CD dot dot
02:51 - then we will go one folder above or
02:55 - parent of the current folder so I will
02:57 - just uh press enter and now you can see
03:01 - we are in the home uh folder so I will
03:04 - just once again give PWD and now we are
03:07 - in the home folder so we go one folder
03:11 - above
03:12 - right in a same way for example I will
03:17 - once again go to my uh home directory by
03:21 - CD till day and then for example I want
03:25 - to uh LS first let's see LS and what are
03:29 - the directories and documents in this
03:31 - folders so in uh my home directory we
03:34 - have a desktop or document folder or
03:38 - other folders right so to uh go inside
03:43 - those folder or to change the directory
03:45 - for example to the document folder you
03:47 - can just write CD and then document okay
03:52 - so just write CD document something like
03:54 - this and you will go to the documents
03:57 - folder once again I will go to my home
04:01 - folder by just uh give giving the CD
04:04 - command and then you can also go to the
04:08 - documents folder by just giving its
04:11 - absolute path so you can just give a CD
04:15 - home then my username which is
04:18 - programming knowledge and then the
04:20 - documents folder okay so you can either
04:24 - give the absolute path which is home uh
04:28 - username uh documents for example or you
04:31 - can give the relative path something
04:33 - like uh CD document this is the relative
04:37 - uh path right so we are already in the
04:41 - document so we will go home and then we
04:44 - can say CD uh documents and we will go
04:48 - to the documents folder right so you can
04:51 - give uh absolute path or the relative
04:54 - path relative path is nothing but so for
04:57 - example I do LS and uh whatever
05:01 - directory you see uh inside your present
05:04 - working directory you can just directly
05:07 - give the name of that directory so for
05:10 - example CD and then uh I can just uh
05:13 - give download this time and press enter
05:16 - and we are in the downloads right now
05:19 - the next command is going to the the
05:24 - directory inside the directory so for
05:27 - example uh let's go to our home and
05:30 - let's clear the screen for now and let's
05:34 - see what we have in our uh document
05:38 - folder so I will just go to the
05:40 - documents folder and I will just do LS
05:45 - and in here I have uh the two files but
05:50 - for example I will create one more
05:52 - folder here inside a documents folder so
05:55 - I will just go inside the documents
05:57 - folder and I will create a new folder
06:00 - for example I will say it's a book
06:03 - folder books folder okay and I want to
06:06 - go inside this folder so how I can do
06:10 - this I can just do CD which will change
06:13 - the directory to the home directory and
06:16 - I can just give uh the command CD
06:21 - documents and then books something like
06:24 - this so you can uh go in the books by
06:27 - giving this command and press enter and
06:30 - we are inside this boooks folder and
06:33 - then right now it has no files but for
06:37 - example I want to create a document I
06:39 - will say just uh test dot uh txt files
06:45 - right so txt file and I will just do LS
06:50 - and you see we have the txt file
06:54 - test.txt file now next command is for
06:58 - example I want to navigate inside this
07:02 - books folder and I will create one more
07:04 - folder there is a command to create uh
07:07 - directory by the way but uh this command
07:11 - we are going to see in the later videos
07:13 - that's why I'm not showing you this
07:15 - Command right now and I'm going to use
07:18 - this graphical view to create my folder
07:20 - so for example I will say this
07:24 - is my books folder okay and if You
07:28 - observe I I have left a space between my
07:32 - and books right and I left the space
07:36 - intentionally so when I do Lis here it
07:40 - will show me there is a folder called my
07:43 - books but if you uh create a folder or
07:47 - directory with my book for with a space
07:51 - then how you can navigate to this uh
07:54 - directory for example I will do my uh CD
07:58 - and then I will just
08:00 - uh you know write my books and press
08:02 - enter and it will give me the error
08:05 - because CD is just looking for the first
08:08 - uh you know argument after this CD
08:11 - command and if it's a space there are
08:13 - two arguments after this CD command so
08:17 - how you can go inside the folder which
08:20 - has space between it there are three
08:23 - options uh you can use to navigate such
08:26 - kind of folder first option is you can
08:29 - just WR CD and then do my and then you
08:33 - give this backs slash and then you give
08:36 - books for example something like this
08:39 - and when you press enter you will go
08:42 - inside this my books folder okay I will
08:46 - go once again one fold above and the
08:49 - second option is instead of uh using
08:52 - this uh back slash you can just write
08:56 - double quote and then you can just write
08:59 - my books okay and press enter and also
09:04 - you are in your my books folder right
09:07 - once again I will go back one folder
09:10 - ahead and the third option how you can
09:13 - uh go uh inside this folder of directory
09:17 - which has uh the space between it you
09:20 - can just give single quote around your
09:23 - uh directory name so press enter and
09:26 - also you are in the same directory okay
09:30 - so what are the command we have used
09:33 - today or we have learned today so I will
09:35 - just clear the terminal and I will once
09:39 - again tell you what are the commands we
09:41 - have learned so CD command if you give
09:44 - then you will go to your home directory
09:48 - okay so I will give CD and I'm in my
09:50 - home directory now in order to navigate
09:53 - to a particular directory I need to give
09:56 - its absolute path or relative path so
09:58 - for example I want to go to root I will
10:01 - just say uh cd/ root and I'm in the root
10:05 - folder once again I will go to my home
10:08 - folder and for example I want to go to
10:11 - CD user bin okay so I will give it
10:15 - absolute path and I'm in the CD user bin
10:18 - and I can just list out all the content
10:21 - of uh this folder by Lis which we have
10:24 - seen in the last video I will clear the
10:27 - terminal once again the the next command
10:30 - is the relative path so for example I
10:33 - will once again go to my home directory
10:36 - and I will just say CD and uh I want to
10:39 - navigate to documents so I can just uh
10:42 - give CD documents or if I want to go uh
10:46 - one folder inside this document I want
10:48 - to navigate to the books folder I can
10:51 - just give uh this uh type of uh you know
10:54 - command and PR press enter and we are in
10:57 - the books folder now we have created a
11:00 - folder with a space between its name
11:04 - then you can use a CD and then either
11:08 - you can use backwards slash between the
11:10 - space or you can enclose this name
11:14 - between double quotes or single quotes
11:17 - and you will be inside that directory
11:20 - and you can work with it so I hope you

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use CD command in Linux CD command we can use to change the current working

which directory we are so we are uh in root directory so we will just give PWD and see if we are in that directory or not so you can see we are in root directory right now once again if you give uh CD
