00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video I will show you
00:06 - how to delete data from a table so let
00:12 - us first open terminal
00:20 - my skill - you - pee
00:35 - okay so databases use data taste
00:50 - so tables here we have rentable select
01:00 - are transparent
01:07 - now I want to delete the specific row
01:12 - which has roll number is equal to 500 so
01:18 - I write delete because I want to delete
01:21 - row from vegetable from student table
01:28 - where how how can this very identify
01:33 - this specific row it's supposed to
01:35 - delete so in we're close we provide the
01:38 - condition they live from student where
01:41 - let's say roll number is equal to 500
01:49 - okay press Enter
01:56 - here you can see this double arrow is no
02:02 - longer available in our table now we can
02:07 - specify multiple condition of course
02:09 - like select sorry delete student
02:25 - where let's say name is equal to this
02:37 - okay
02:39 - I want to delete this on we use end
02:48 - operator and surname is equal to C okay
03:02 - here you can see this row has been
03:07 - limited
03:11 - okay so let's whip this terminal open
03:18 - MySQL workbench
03:26 - here there is one more method just go to
03:32 - your tables it's prudent right-click on
03:37 - that and here you can see open the
03:42 - people here you can see delete statement
03:48 - just click on that and press command V
03:53 - or control V if you are using Windows
03:56 - and your SQL statement will be copied
04:00 - here
04:01 - you can specify where expression here
04:05 - okay so alright we're rollin umber is
04:19 - equal to let's say five ten
04:27 - okay one grow affected
04:42 - so 5/10 wrong number is no longer
04:45 - available in our table now let's see one
04:50 - more example delete from student
05:02 - [Music]
05:08 - roll number is equal to let's say 120 or
05:19 - name is equal to breech
05:24 - now we have used our keyword here and if
05:30 - you observe that 120 roll number is not
05:33 - present in our table so name is equal to
05:39 - breech which is present of a table and
05:43 - we specified or keyword and if you know
05:46 - in our only videos we saw that our
05:48 - condition will give result where even if
05:54 - there is one condition which holds true
05:56 - so this condition holds true in our
05:59 - scenario so this specific couple will be
06:05 - deleted
06:11 - as you can see now you wonder that what
06:19 - if we do not provide a we're closed and
06:21 - we simply write delete from student I
06:31 - will not execute this very because if
06:36 - you do not provide we're closed then by
06:39 - default it will select all the tuples
06:41 - from your table and delete all the data
06:44 - which ever present in your table okay so
06:50 - this is how you can delete data from
06:53 - your table thanks for watching
