With timestamps:

00:00 - on this particular video we are going to
00:01 - learn about
00:03 - host command okay so basically this
00:05 - command used for the DNS lookup it
00:07 - basically means you are going to find
00:09 - information about the DNS servers as
00:11 - well the IP addresses of a domain name
00:14 - or or domain name with IP address you
00:18 - can say so but before moving forward in
00:20 - this particular video you should know
00:22 - the basics of domain name server okay so
00:25 - this is a basically one of the
00:26 - networking Concept in which we will
00:30 - learn okay
00:31 - in the following topics like actually
00:33 - have written already one blog on DNS
00:35 - so you can go and learn from this
00:37 - infosec write-ups and if you will search
00:40 - for all about DNS
00:42 - 100 days of hacking you will get it let
00:44 - me search it for you
00:50 - info stick write-ups
00:55 - okay so this is the first one write up
00:57 - by ayush Verma okay you can get it from
01:00 - here
01:01 - so let me tell you the basic idea of
01:03 - what is this domain name server and all
01:06 - these things so basically DNS stands for
01:09 - domain name server okay
01:11 - it means the whatever the your
01:14 - google.com it is a domain name it will
01:17 - get converted into the IP address or
01:19 - vice versa or IP address will get
01:21 - converted into the domain
01:24 - so with the main reason behind this is
01:26 - romanium service why this domain name
01:28 - server came in a role okay so just think
01:32 - like a normal human if you uh you are
01:35 - given a one address like 192.168.42.35
01:40 - whether this is easily remember easy to
01:44 - remember or google.com is easy to
01:46 - remember okay just think once so
01:48 - obviously you will say like sorry
01:50 - google.com is easy to remember that's
01:52 - why that is the main reason behind this
01:54 - of DNS that's why it came in a role
01:56 - so we will see the basically working of
01:59 - how it basically Works uh let me move
02:02 - down
02:04 - as here you can see the I have written
02:06 - like in more explanation I have given
02:09 - here you can learn it
02:10 - and also how it works I will tell you
02:13 - and this is the domain High key like
02:15 - root level domain top level domain
02:17 - second level domain like.com dot
02:20 - government Dot
02:22 - mil these are the root level domains
02:24 - okay
02:25 - and try hack my Google USA sub domains
02:29 - okay so you can learn all about these
02:31 - things and now let's moving forward to
02:34 - the working of
02:36 - this DNS okay so whenever user types in
02:40 - web address this particular
02:42 - main name what happens in this case it
02:45 - will first do the DNS query from where
02:47 - DNS resolver okay DNS is always also one
02:50 - of the part of this particular process
02:52 - where summary codes are stored now next
02:56 - what will happen it will send the
02:57 - request to this root server whether if
02:59 - the
03:00 - domain.com or dot anything it will move
03:03 - to the root server it will ask for do
03:05 - you have this IP address of this
03:07 - particular domain if it will say yes
03:09 - then it will forward the request
03:12 - then again for this step it will go with
03:14 - the TLD server and again with authority
03:16 - name server and after that it will go to
03:20 - the main server of that particular
03:22 - website after getting the IP address
03:24 - okay so this is the overall working of
03:26 - this domain name server
03:28 - and now we will talk about the what are
03:31 - the records in DNS okay so basically DNS
03:35 - request provide the information about
03:36 - the particular domain
03:38 - so I will
03:40 - like go down and let me tell you the
03:43 - Rook records okay
03:44 - so these are the basically some of the
03:46 - records like a records this four a
03:49 - records MX record CNN record you can
03:51 - learn about these all things like ad
03:53 - cost provide us the ipv4 addresses and
03:56 - AAA and also one more Ray that is a 4A
03:59 - record providers the IPv6 address mxley
04:02 - cost provide us the
04:04 - like Mail Exchange address CNM record is
04:07 - also provides like uh like it points the
04:09 - subdomain to the main domain basically
04:11 - if there is a
04:13 - gmail.google.com or google.com both will
04:16 - point to the only single domain or it's
04:18 - not domain single IP addresses okay
04:22 - now moving this is the name server
04:24 - record that is NS records okay and txtd
04:27 - code is some kind of record that
04:29 - administered some kind of text and all
04:31 - these things okay now let's move to our
04:34 - main motive of this particular video
04:36 - that is the host command okay
04:39 - so I hope you got to learn about all
04:40 - those things about DNS records
04:43 - I hope it is visible to you let me just
04:45 - increase the size first so that it will
04:48 - be easy to
04:50 - it will be easily visible okay
04:53 - so now let's enter the host
04:55 - and just provide the google.com
04:59 - okay oh wait a minute
05:01 - [Music]
05:04 - okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind
05:06 - of error
05:12 - okay
05:13 - host
05:16 - google.com
05:19 - Okay google.com not found why like this
05:26 - post
05:28 - okay it's working
05:36 - okay let me provide another iPad another
05:39 - domain name like uh let me provide Gmail
05:44 - foreign
05:49 - .com not found okay while this is
05:53 - happening I'm not getting
05:57 - let me do first thing whether it's
05:59 - working or not
06:02 - temporary failure in name resolution
06:06 - let me ping another some domain name
06:08 - that is a
06:10 - uh
06:12 - which two Magnum should I
06:16 - let me check here medium.com let me do
06:23 - t com
06:25 - why it's happening I'm not getting uh
06:27 - let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine
06:30 - so that
06:32 - after it may be uh work let me do
06:36 - okay now I have started restarting my PC
06:39 - uh let me now perform the that command
06:43 - okay so I hope it is visible to you uh
06:45 - let's do host google.com
06:51 - okay so here you can see the address of
06:53 - google.com that is uh that is the ipv4
06:56 - that is what does ipv4 address mean it
06:58 - means that it is a like 32-bit address I
07:01 - guess okay if I'm not wrong uh let me
07:04 - check why to create confusion for you
07:07 - guys okay
07:08 - IP address
07:10 - bit
07:12 - size okay
07:14 - I hope it is 32 yeah I was correct okay
07:16 - it's 32-bit address
07:18 - it ranges from 0 to 20 0 2 to double
07:21 - five
07:22 - okay so here you can see the IP
07:25 - addresses of google.com that is
07:28 - 172.217.27.2.6 and again with with same
07:31 - like you will get this IPv6 address so
07:34 - that this is the
07:35 - like version 6 addresses of google.com
07:37 - and the mail server address that is MTP
07:41 - now what will happen
07:42 - if you will think about the concept of
07:45 - DNS what is happening here is when you
07:48 - are entering google.com
07:50 - so that domain is mapped with this
07:53 - particular IP address this one
07:55 - let me copy this IP address and let me
08:00 - put it here what will happen whether it
08:03 - will go on to the google.com or not
08:05 - let's check
08:10 - okay damn so here you can see that that
08:14 - IP address is mapped to the google.com
08:17 - that's why
08:18 - like we are going on this particular
08:21 - domain name what will happen if I will
08:24 - see I will just
08:26 - change.206 to 205 whether it will go to
08:28 - the same or different let's check
08:31 - okay it's going to the same
08:33 - because that per whole IP address may be
08:36 - belonging to that particular google.com
08:40 - let me do two double zero
08:43 - okay it's same okay so now uh let's go
08:47 - for some another domain also host uh
08:50 - let's go with medium.com
08:53 - like sometimes it happens like uh you
08:56 - can't go on a particular okay I press
08:59 - something like print okay
09:03 - when sometimes what happens when you
09:05 - enter the IP address of some of the
09:07 - domain name then at that time you will
09:09 - not be able to reach that particular
09:11 - domain because of firewall
09:13 - implementation and all
09:16 - so here also you can see different IP
09:18 - addresses mail servers okay so let me
09:21 - check this one
09:23 - one five three Dot
09:25 - four
09:30 - okay let's check whether it goes or not
09:32 - okay so yeah here you can see the direct
09:35 - iPad is not allowed why because I think
09:37 - they are using cloudflare
09:40 - Cloud Player they are using yes
09:42 - your IP here I will get my IP address
09:45 - okay
09:47 - so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now
09:51 - moving forward in this particular video
09:54 - with the getting the DNS records of a
09:57 - particular domain name okay
09:59 - so how you can get it like uh using
10:02 - hyphen T option we can get and also if
10:06 - you want to get only the IPv6 address
10:08 - you can get if it is available
10:12 - so here you can see connection is
10:14 - refused
10:16 - now let's check with the CNM record okay
10:18 - so if you don't know about CNM record
10:20 - you can go here and learn about it
10:23 - on this particular block okay
10:28 - domain to another domain for example you
10:31 - can see blog.example.com has a CNM
10:34 - record with a value of example.com This
10:36 - Means whenever DNS record hits the DNS
10:39 - record for blocked example it actually
10:41 - triggers another DNS lookup to which
10:44 - domain that is the example domain
10:47 - and it basically turns the IP of the
10:49 - same that is main domain name
10:51 - example.com domain okay
10:55 - so uh let's do the DNS look of all this
10:58 - particular record that is which one CNM
11:01 - record
11:02 - so the command is very simple host
11:05 - hyphen T C name and you have to just
11:08 - write any domain name which you want
11:09 - let's do with google.com
11:12 - okay it has no any record
11:15 - uh maybe it will be for medium
11:18 - let's check
11:20 - okay no records
11:23 - uh any website
11:28 - okay
11:30 - let me search for
11:33 - random colleges
11:37 - in Delhi
11:40 - if I get any college website now let's
11:42 - go with the siksha.com
11:52 - copy it
11:55 - and just paste it here
12:04 - okay so here we are getting the
12:08 - okay not found
12:10 - okay
12:13 - so these sites are not having any CM
12:15 - because let's go with some another
12:17 - record
12:18 - uh let me check with the MX record that
12:20 - is the main election it should be there
12:22 - yeah it has a mixed record let's go for
12:26 - uh gold medium.com
12:32 - yeah they are using
12:34 - MX record okay and let's check for
12:37 - another record that is a txt record
12:42 - okay we are getting it here all those
12:44 - records
12:46 - uh let's check for
12:49 - okay another website that is shiksha
12:52 - hyphen ttxt record
12:57 - okay we are getting all those
12:59 - information whatever the
13:01 - Act is stored in this particular text
13:03 - file in the DNS records okay
13:05 - so I hope you like this particular video
13:07 - and today we will stop here and the next
13:10 - video we will learn about something new
13:11 - okay so that's all for today's video and
13:13 - if you have any queries then please ask
13:14 - us in the comment section so thank you
13:16 - thank you for watching and we'll meet in
13:17 - the next video thank you

Cleaned transcript:

on this particular video we are going to learn about host command okay so basically this command used for the DNS lookup it basically means you are going to find information about the DNS servers as well the IP addresses of a domain name or or domain name with IP address you can say so but before moving forward in this particular video you should know the basics of domain name server okay so this is a basically one of the networking Concept in which we will learn okay in the following topics like actually have written already one blog on DNS so you can go and learn from this infosec writeups and if you will search for all about DNS 100 days of hacking you will get it let me search it for you info stick writeups okay so this is the first one write up by ayush Verma okay you can get it from here so let me tell you the basic idea of what is this domain name server and all these things so basically DNS stands for domain name server okay it means the whatever the your google.com it is a domain name it will get converted into the IP address or vice versa or IP address will get converted into the domain so with the main reason behind this is romanium service why this domain name server came in a role okay so just think like a normal human if you uh you are given a one address like 192.168.42.35 whether this is easily remember easy to remember or google.com is easy to remember okay just think once so obviously you will say like sorry google.com is easy to remember that's why that is the main reason behind this of DNS that's why it came in a role so we will see the basically working of how it basically Works uh let me move down as here you can see the I have written like in more explanation I have given here you can learn it and also how it works I will tell you and this is the domain High key like root level domain top level domain second level domain like.com dot government Dot mil these are the root level domains okay and try hack my Google USA sub domains okay so you can learn all about these things and now let's moving forward to the working of this DNS okay so whenever user types in web address this particular main name what happens in this case it will first do the DNS query from where DNS resolver okay DNS is always also one of the part of this particular process where summary codes are stored now next what will happen it will send the request to

single IP addresses okay now moving this is the name server record that is NS records okay and txtd code is some kind of record that administered some kind of text and all these things okay now let's move to our main motive of this particular video that is the host command okay so I hope you got to learn about all those things about DNS records I hope it is visible to you let me just increase the size first so that it will be easy to it will be easily visible okay so now let's enter the host and just provide the google.com okay oh wait a minute okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind of error okay host google.com Okay google.com not found why like this post okay it's working okay let me provide another iPad another domain name like uh let me provide Gmail foreign .com not found okay while this is happening I'm not getting let me do first thing whether it's working or not temporary failure in name resolution let me ping another some domain name that is a uh which two Magnum should I let me check here medium.com let me do t com why it's happening I'm not getting uh let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine so that after it may be uh work let me do okay now I have started restarting my PC uh let me now perform the that command okay so I hope it is visible to you uh let's do host google.com okay so here you can see the address of google.com that is uh that is the ipv4 that is what does ipv4 address mean it means that it is a like 32bit address I guess okay if I'm not wrong uh let me check why to create confusion for you guys okay IP address bit size okay I hope it is 32 yeah I was correct okay it's 32bit address it ranges from 0 to 20 0 2 to double five okay so here you can see the IP addresses of google.com that is 172.217.27.2.6 and again with with same like you will get this IPv6 address so that this is the like version 6 addresses of google.com and the mail server address that is MTP now what will happen if you will think about the concept of DNS what is happening here is when you are entering google.com so that domain is mapped with this particular IP address this one let me copy this IP address and let me put it here what will happen whether it will go on to

let me do two double zero okay it's same okay so now uh let's go for some another domain also host uh let's go with medium.com like sometimes it happens like uh you can't go on a particular okay I press something like print okay when sometimes what happens when you enter the IP address of some of the domain name then at that time you will not be able to reach that particular domain because of firewall implementation and all so here also you can see different IP addresses mail servers okay so let me check this one one five three Dot four okay let's check whether it goes or not okay so yeah here you can see the direct iPad is not allowed why because I think they are using cloudflare Cloud Player they are using yes your IP here I will get my IP address okay so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now moving forward in this particular video with the getting the DNS records of a particular domain name okay so how you can get it like uh using hyphen T option we can get and also if you want

let's do with google.com okay it has no any record uh maybe it will be for medium let's check okay no records uh any website okay let me search for random colleges in Delhi if I get any college website now let's go with the siksha.com copy it and just paste it here okay so here we are getting the okay not found okay so these sites are not having any CM because let's go with some another record uh let me check with the MX record that is the main election it should be there yeah it has a mixed record let's go for uh gold medium.com yeah they are using MX record okay and let's check for another record that is a txt record okay we are getting it here all those records uh let's check for okay another website that is shiksha hyphen ttxt record okay we are getting all those information whatever the Act is stored in this particular text file in the DNS records okay so I hope you like this particular video and today we will stop here and the next video we will learn about something new okay so that's all for today's video and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you
