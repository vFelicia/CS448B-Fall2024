00:00 - programming knowledge so in this
00:02 - tutorial we are going to learn how to
00:04 - retrieve our data from cloud fire store
00:07 - so for this I have created a sample
00:11 - document in my file store I have named
00:14 - the collection as cities and inside that
00:18 - I have added five documents BJ DC LA SF
00:23 - and T okay and all of these have these
00:27 - details BJ is for Beijing
00:30 - and it's countries China it is the
00:33 - capital true this is the population over
00:35 - there now let's try downloading this
00:38 - details in our program so for that I
00:41 - will go to my main activity and in my
00:44 - main activity and right I will create a
00:46 - document reference variable document
00:50 - rough I will call it doc ref and I will
00:54 - initialize it by writing firebase
00:56 - firestore dot getinstance dot collection
01:03 - cities the dotted document and let's
01:12 - give the document parts let's say SF
01:16 - that is for San Francisco so I am
01:19 - writing the document name over here as s
01:22 - and F now to get the value present in
01:29 - this document we use the keyword get so
01:33 - I will write dog ref dot get dot add on
01:42 - complete listener new uncomplete
01:45 - listener now I will check if the task is
01:50 - successful so I'll write if task dot is
01:53 - successful then I go to the document in
01:57 - the form of document snapshot so I
02:00 - create a document snapshot variable and
02:02 - call a doc and I will get a task dot get
02:08 - result
02:12 - and now let me check if this document
02:15 - exists or not so I'll write if doc dot
02:22 - exists then I will just log it
02:27 - so I'll write log dot d and I will write
02:39 - document
02:42 - and then over here I'll write doc dot
02:48 - get data that returns the data inside
02:53 - the document snapshot else I'll log
03:11 - no data
03:18 - now let's try running it so I will click
03:22 - on the Run button over here and open the
03:24 - log cut to see the logs and wait for the
03:27 - Gradle build to finish so there is a
03:31 - compilation error over here which says
03:36 - that oh so I need to convert it to
03:39 - string so i will write over here dot to
03:42 - string now the error will be gone let's
03:46 - try running it again so once the Gradle
03:54 - builder is finished and the app started
03:56 - running we can see in our lock cat we
03:59 - have bought the document over here and
04:03 - it has the value named as a San
04:06 - Francisco State as CA capital as false
04:11 - and population as this much country as
04:14 - USA and regions and in regions we get an
04:18 - ArrayList of west coast and NorCal which
04:22 - is similar to what we have in our SF
04:25 - document over here the capital is false
04:28 - countries USA name is San Francisco
04:32 - population is exactly the same number as
04:34 - we have seen in our log cat then it has
04:38 - another region list and it has two
04:41 - values west coast and morkul and the
04:44 - state is C so this is how we download
04:48 - the values from cloud firestore to our
04:51 - app now suppose we want to download some
04:58 - documents based on some condition let's
05:01 - say for example I only want to download
05:04 - those cities which are the capital of
05:08 - their respective country for let's say
05:11 - Beijing which is the capital of China
05:13 - and Tokyo which is the capital of Japan
05:17 - so to do this we write we don't need
05:22 - this in our program right now I'll write
05:27 - firebase firestore dot great instance
05:31 - dot collection cities and then to check
05:36 - the condition I'll write dot where equal
05:40 - to capital and true
05:48 - which means where capital is equal to
05:51 - true I will get those values and I'll
05:55 - add an on complete listener and over
06:01 - here I will check if the task is
06:03 - successful and if the task X is
06:10 - successful I'll run up for each loop so
06:13 - for that I will write for query document
06:19 - snapshot I'll name it doc and to get the
06:25 - writer a well we write a task dot get
06:30 - result and and over here we can log the
06:39 - details so I will write a log dot d
06:47 - document and over here I will write doc
06:56 - dot to get ID which is a unique ID of
07:01 - the document plus an arrow plus doc dot
07:11 - to get data
07:16 - and now let's try running with so I'll
07:20 - click on the Run button open the lock
07:23 - cut and wait for the Gradle build to
07:25 - finish so once the app has started
07:28 - running you can see we have three
07:30 - documents over here and they have their
07:33 - ID and then the details in this case the
07:36 - IDing idea is the name of the document
07:39 - and the details are exactly the same as
07:42 - we have in our database so this is how
07:45 - we download data based on some
07:47 - conditions now suppose we want to add a
07:51 - real-time listener to any one of the
07:53 - document present in our collection let's
07:56 - say I want to add a real-time listener
07:59 - to my la document so what I am going to
08:03 - do is first I am going to remove these
08:05 - quotes as I don't need them anymore and
08:10 - then I will write document the document
08:14 - name and then I'll write dot add
08:18 - snapshot listener new event listener and
08:29 - then over here we can do all the tasks
08:32 - that we want to do this is very similar
08:36 - to value event listener which we had in
08:39 - our real time database so this is it
08:44 - about fire cloud fire store I hope
08:48 - everything was clear thank you
