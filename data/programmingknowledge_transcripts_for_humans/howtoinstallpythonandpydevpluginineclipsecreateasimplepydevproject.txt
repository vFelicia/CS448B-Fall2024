00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can integrate Python
00:05 - with your Eclipse IDE using pi dev
00:09 - plugin so first of all you need to have
00:12 - a Python installed in order to add this
00:16 - Python support on your Eclipse IDE so
00:19 - first of all we are going to download
00:20 - and install Python and then we are going
00:24 - to configure it with your Eclipse IDE
00:27 - hopefully you have downloaded and
00:30 - installed Eclipse IDE I'm not going to
00:33 - show you how you can download and
00:35 - install Eclipse IDE but I'm going to
00:37 - show you how you can download and
00:39 - install Python first so open your
00:42 - favorite browser and search for Python
00:44 - and then go to the first link which will
00:48 - be a dub dub dub dot Pathan Wadi you can
00:52 - directly click this download button from
00:56 - here and it will redirect you to the
01:00 - downloads page of Python dot Watchi now
01:04 - you can see there are so many you know
01:07 - versions of Python but we are going to
01:10 - download the latest version at the time
01:12 - of making this video the latest version
01:14 - is Python 3.5 point one and they also
01:19 - have the legacy version which is 2.7
01:21 - point 11 so we are going to download
01:23 - this version which is 2.5 point 1 and
01:26 - just click this and it's going to you
01:30 - know download this python executable
01:33 - file so just save this file it's not
01:35 - going to be a big file so just save it
01:39 - and then once it's downloaded you just
01:43 - need to run this python file so it's
01:48 - almost done you can see here and once
01:52 - it's downloaded we will run it so let's
01:55 - run this executable file now and
01:57 - minimize the browser and you can see
02:02 - install a Python you can just you know
02:06 - click this install section here and then
02:10 - you can install Python so just click
02:13 - this
02:13 - and click yes it's going to initialize
02:18 - the process and then it's going to
02:20 - install Python on your Windows operating
02:23 - system
02:24 - now by the time this installation is
02:27 - taking place let's install PI dev
02:31 - plug-in on our Eclipse IDE so that we
02:35 - can save some time so go to your Eclipse
02:37 - IDE and in your Eclipse IDE you can see
02:40 - this help tab here and in the help tab
02:44 - you just need to search for the section
02:46 - called install new software and in here
02:51 - you need to give this you are a lot
02:55 - going to paste this URL in the
02:56 - description also which is HTTP then
03:00 - colon forward slash two times and then
03:04 - PI dev dot o-r-g and then forward slash
03:13 - updates ok and then search for it and
03:18 - then it's going to give you these two
03:21 - options one is pydev and other is pydev
03:25 - for some other application which is
03:28 - optional
03:29 - we are going to choose the first option
03:30 - which says only PI Dave ok and now click
03:35 - Next and once again select this pydev
03:39 - for Eclipse and click Next and then you
03:43 - need to you know read this license terms
03:46 - in excrement and if you are in agreement
03:49 - with the license you can just click I
03:52 - agree and then click finish and it's
03:55 - going to install this pydev plug-in on
03:58 - your Eclipse IDE let's see how is our
04:03 - python installation so you can see our
04:07 - python installation is done so i can
04:09 - close this now and i will wait for this
04:13 - pydev plugin on eclipse to install ok
04:18 - now in between the process of
04:21 - installation of this pydev plugin you
04:24 - may see this kind of
04:26 - warning which says do you trust these
04:30 - certificate you need to select also just
04:33 - click this button select all and then
04:36 - click ok here ok and then I let the
04:40 - process to complete and once the process
04:43 - is complete you need to restart your
04:45 - Eclipse IDE and that's what this warning
04:49 - is saying you will need to restart
04:51 - eclipse for the changes to take effect
04:54 - so you must say yes here so you just
04:58 - need to click yes it's going to relaunch
05:01 - your Eclipse IDE and once you are a
05:04 - Clips ID is relaunched you can create
05:07 - your first Python program in Eclipse IDE
05:11 - so let's create a new Python project so
05:14 - go to files here and then go to new and
05:17 - then go to others and in the other you
05:21 - just need to search for pi dev which is
05:25 - this option and in the pydev you have
05:28 - you know many options here but the one
05:32 - we are looking for is this pi dev
05:35 - project
05:36 - ok so search for pi dev project and then
05:39 - click next and in here you need to give
05:43 - the name to your project for example
05:45 - test Python and then in here you can see
05:51 - the grammar version and we have
05:54 - downloaded and installed at 3.5 so you
05:57 - need to select keep on zero version here
06:01 - and then you can see this little blue
06:06 - line it says please configure an
06:09 - interpreter before proceeding so just
06:12 - click this blue link from here and then
06:16 - you just say manual config ok so just
06:19 - say manual config and from here we need
06:23 - to give the location for the python
06:26 - interpreter so where is our Python
06:30 - installed let's see so if you have
06:33 - Windows 8 you can just search for python
06:37 - from here and that
06:39 - you will see this Python 3.5 32-bit you
06:44 - can right-click on this search option
06:46 - and then you can just say open file
06:50 - location' which is going to open this
06:53 - shortcut location and then once again
06:56 - you need to click this shortcut from
06:59 - here and then you just need to once
07:03 - again select this option which says open
07:06 - file location' which is going to open
07:08 - the file location for python executable
07:12 - file okay and then just copy this part
07:16 - from here and then go to your Eclipse
07:19 - IDE and in here just select new and then
07:24 - you just need to browse for this path
07:28 - okay so just browse and then just paste
07:33 - the location which you have copied for
07:35 - the Python exe and then select this
07:39 - Python dot exe from here you don't need
07:42 - to choose this python w dot exe but you
07:47 - need to choose this python exe from here
07:50 - and then click open and in here you need
07:53 - to give the name to your interpreter so
07:56 - just remove this long name and you can
08:01 - just give the name python 3.5 for
08:07 - example okay or python 3.5 point 1 and
08:11 - then click OK and then click OK once
08:17 - again and then apply the changes so
08:20 - select this apply button and then once
08:24 - this apply is you know implemented then
08:28 - you just need to click OK okay so our
08:32 - Python interpreter is you know
08:35 - configured and then we can choose the
08:37 - interpreter from here so just choose
08:40 - python 3.5 point one which we have you
08:43 - know configured and then click Next
08:46 - and in here you don't need to do
08:50 - anything
08:51 - you just need to select finish from here
08:53 - okay and then click yes and then it's
08:59 - going to open this Python perspective
09:02 - from here right and here is my project
09:06 - which has right now no files and folders
09:11 - now inside your project which is test
09:15 - Python in my case you can just right
09:18 - click on this project and then you can
09:21 - select the the pydev packages and then
09:24 - inside those packages you can create by
09:27 - dev module but right now I'm going to
09:29 - just create the pider module because
09:32 - it's only going to have one file so I'm
09:35 - going to choose buy them module from
09:37 - here and for packages I'm going to leave
09:40 - it as default and for the name I'm going
09:44 - to name it as test for now and I'm going
09:46 - to click finish and you can see this
09:53 - option you can you know just choose show
09:57 - later and from here you can see you have
10:01 - some options so these are the template
10:05 - option which is you know presented by
10:07 - this pydev plugin for you one is empty
10:11 - template or other is a class template or
10:14 - main module template we are going to
10:17 - just choose the empty template for now
10:19 - and then click OK and then you can once
10:23 - again click show later and then click OK
10:28 - and now you can see our test dot py file
10:33 - is created right so you can go to your
10:39 - test dot Python file and in here you can
10:43 - just write your code for example we want
10:45 - to print hello world just write print
10:47 - and in the bracket you can just write
10:50 - hello world and then save this and then
10:57 - you can just right click on your project
11:00 - and you can run it okay so you can right
11:04 - click and run
11:05 - as Python run just click this bite and
11:09 - run and choose the file which is test
11:13 - dot Python in your case and then click
11:16 - OK and now you can see hello world
11:19 - printed in the console here ok so in
11:23 - this way you can download and install
11:26 - python and configure it with your
11:28 - Eclipse IDE using pydev plug-in on your
11:31 - Windows operating system
