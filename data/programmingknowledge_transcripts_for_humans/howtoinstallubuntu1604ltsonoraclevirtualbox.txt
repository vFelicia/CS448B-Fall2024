01:33 - relatively Big File about 900 MB so be
01:38 - patient and wait for 10 minutes to
01:40 - download and after you have downloaded
01:42 - this ISO file on your computer you're
01:46 - ready to start your virtual machine and

02:08 - uh yeah when you search with the name
02:10 - ubu virtual box automatically recognizes
02:13 - that you are uh looking for open to
02:17 - operating system and by default it gives
02:19 - you this option the version is 64bit
02:22 - version but you can choose 32bit if you
02:25 - have downloaded 32 version so I will
02:29 - lead it as 64 version because I have
02:32 - downloaded 64bit click next and here you
02:35 - can allocate the memory which you want
02:38 - to provide to your openo operating
02:40 - system by default it's 512 MB I will

02:49 - will I will leave it as default create a
02:53 - virtual hard drive
02:54 - now and this also I will leave it as
02:58 - default vdi which which is virtual box
03:00 - dis
03:01 - image and in here you can choose if you
03:05 - want to allocate the dynamically
03:07 - allocated memory or you want fixed size
03:10 - memory you can just read these advantage
03:14 - of fixed size and dynamically allocated
03:18 - memory from here I will choose uh

09:04 - give a
09:07 - password and confirm the
09:11 - password and click
09:20 - continue and now the installation
09:24 - started so it will take some time to
09:28 - install this
09:30 - Ubuntu so you see here it's right now
09:34 - copying the files and it will take a
09:37 - while to install uh this operating
09:40 - system so wait for some time and I will
09:44 - pause this video and restart it if any
09:47 - important step happens
09:53 - okay so once you have uh completed the
09:57 - this installation
09:59 - this message will uh be shown that you

10:26 - able to use obun to in your virtual
10:30 - machine so just wait for
10:46 - restart and generally I have seen that
10:49 - this
10:50 - restart for the first time it takes some
10:53 - time so what you can even do is you can
10:57 - just uh cancel this uh uh virtual
11:00 - machine which is running and restart
11:02 - your bundu once again by yourself just
11:05 - cancel this and
11:07 - click power off the
11:11 - machine and or you can give this send
11:14 - the shutdown signal I will choose this
11:17 - power of the machine and click okay and
11:19 - now you can restart it by this button
11:22 - once again start
11:27 - button and this time it will show you
11:30 - probably the
11:31 - login
11:38 - screen so it's
11:56 - starting open to is started
12:01 - now so it depends upon the uh speed of
12:05 - your computer also how fast this open to
12:09 - operating system starts right so it has
12:13 - uh nothing to with you know it's taking
12:17 - so much long time on my computer because
12:20 - it's a little bit slow but if you have

13:11 - curious why this size of this desktop is
13:15 - not
13:16 - resizing uh as you uh expand this
13:20 - virtual box because you need to you know
13:23 - install some more virtual box drivers in
13:26 - order to make it you know scratch this
13:29 - desktop so size will remain same for the
13:33 - first time when you install it but I
13:35 - will post a link below this uh video or
