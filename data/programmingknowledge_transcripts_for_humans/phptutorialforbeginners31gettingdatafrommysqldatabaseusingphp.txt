00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how you can
00:04 - connect
00:05 - your PHP script to the mySQL database
00:09 - using PHP my admin right so we were
00:13 - having this database called student and
00:16 - we were able to connect to this database
00:18 - in the last video now in this video I'm
00:20 - going to show you how you can get the
00:24 - data so we had uh this student database
00:28 - and we created a us info if you remember
00:32 - and it has some data right and I want to
00:35 - show all this data uh on the browser or
00:39 - using PHP right so how can I show this
00:43 - in this video I'm going to show you so
00:47 - let's get started this is the connect.
00:49 - PHP which I have created uh in the last
00:53 - video and I'm going to use this uh
00:55 - connect. PHP to connect to the database
00:59 - and then
01:00 - I will create a new file and I will save
01:04 - it
01:06 - as get
01:10 - data.php
01:12 - and I will save
01:14 - it and in here I will just include my
01:20 - PHP
01:25 - tags and now first of all I need to
01:29 - connect to the database in this file
01:31 - right so what I'm going to do is in this
01:34 - file I have written the code to connect
01:38 - to the database which is connect. PHP so
01:40 - I will just require this file so I will
01:43 - use this keyword
01:46 - called require and the name of my
01:51 - connect file which
01:53 - [Music]
01:56 - is
01:57 - connect. PHP
02:00 - right so this is this file which I have
02:03 - written in the last video okay once I
02:08 - have this
02:09 - file then what I'm going to do is I will
02:13 - write a query to get the data from the
02:16 - database so I will declare a variable
02:19 - called query is equal to and inside this
02:24 - I am going to write a query as a string
02:30 - now if you know a little bit
02:33 - of my SQL you already know what a query
02:37 - is query is a small little string which
02:41 - you can send to your database to query
02:46 - the data from the database right for
02:48 - example I have this uh table called user
02:52 - info and I want the data from the table
02:56 - for example this data which I have saved
02:58 - earlier in the database base and I want
03:01 - to query this data from the database
03:03 - base so what can I do is if you don't
03:07 - know about SQL queries uh I'll show you
03:10 - a simple way so just select your table
03:14 - in which you have saved your
03:16 - data and go to the structure
03:21 - here we will go to this SQL tab here
03:25 - okay so this is the tab you need to go
03:29 - once you selected your table right and
03:32 - you will see a query here which is a
03:35 - simple query to get the data from the
03:37 - database this is Select star or estx
03:40 - from your table name this is a simple
03:43 - query
03:45 - so I'm going to use the same simple
03:48 - query to get the data from the database
03:50 - in this video okay so I will just copy
03:52 - this I will leave this where clause for
03:57 - now I will just use this this query okay
04:01 - so just copy this query select estx from
04:05 - your table name table name is user info
04:07 - so this is user info and I will just
04:10 - copy it here okay so this will be my
04:14 - query simple
04:15 - query and then what I'm going to do is
04:19 - I'm going to create a while loop while
04:23 - because I want to read the data once uh
04:25 - I um execute this query right so so what
04:31 - I'm going to do is first of all let's
04:33 - execute the query first so I'm going to
04:36 - give if condition and I want to check
04:39 - whether if this query is executed or not
04:43 - right so what I'm going to do
04:46 - is I'm going
04:49 - to um make a variable
04:52 - called
04:55 - um is
05:02 - very run for example you can give any
05:06 - variable name is equal to and now I'm
05:10 - going to use a function in my SQL so
05:15 - which fetches the data or which executes
05:17 - the query so just write
05:20 - MySQL
05:23 - underscore query okay this is the
05:26 - function in PHP which you from which you
05:29 - can execute your query and what it does
05:32 - it returns Boolean value so if the query
05:36 - is executed it will return true and we
05:38 - will go to the condition or statement
05:40 - inside if condition otherwise if it's um
05:44 - not executed it will return false and we
05:47 - will be able to catch the else condition
05:51 - right now I'm going to pass my query
05:54 - which is this one to
05:57 - my MySQL Query function function
06:00 - right now once this query is executed I
06:04 - can echo
06:08 - echo for
06:11 - now
06:15 - query executive for example okay else I
06:20 - can just
06:23 - show
06:25 - else I can just say qu not executed
06:32 - right so let's see if we are able to
06:35 - execute our query or not and then we
06:37 - will get the data from the database and
06:39 - show it okay I save it and I will go to
06:45 - Local Host and to my
06:48 - folder and then database and in here
06:52 - this was the file I have made right get
06:56 - data and it says connection successful P
07:00 - or connection success which comes from
07:03 - this file connect file which says
07:05 - connection success for now I'm going to
07:08 - comment this out so I don't need to see
07:11 - this uh connection success and I will
07:14 - save it and I will refresh it and now it
07:18 - says query executed so now I know that
07:21 - my query is successfully executed this
07:24 - query right now once the query is Su
07:28 - successfully executed what I want is I
07:31 - want to get the data okay so that this I
07:36 - can use by
07:37 - using while
07:40 - loop
07:42 - while and why I'm using the while loop I
07:46 - will show you
07:48 - because I want to fetch the data from
07:52 - the database and it will be an
07:56 - associative array Okay so what function
08:00 - we can use to get the data let's see so
08:04 - I I will declare a variable called
08:10 - very uh UND underscore
08:15 - excute is equal to this is a variable
08:17 - name right and we will use my
08:21 - SQL
08:23 - underscore
08:25 - fetch ass source as o C which means
08:31 - associative array right and in
08:36 - this function MySQL fetch as o we will
08:42 - pass
08:44 - our
08:45 - qu run okay this one this
08:51 - variable so just copy this and pass it
08:55 - here and once we have our we will
09:00 - execute this function it will return the
09:03 - data in the form of associative array in
09:06 - this variable okay so what we can do is
09:10 - we can just cut this from here
09:13 - and just paste it
09:16 - inside as a argument of our y Loop so we
09:19 - have our associative array here right in
09:23 - this
09:24 - variable okay so now what I can do is I
09:28 - can get get uh this or I can call this
09:32 - uh associative array variable to get the
09:37 - data so for example I want to get all
09:41 - the
09:42 - names from this user inut table so I
09:46 - have this user input table in my
09:49 - database and I have the column like ID
09:52 - name surname age username and password
09:55 - so I want to show all the names from
09:57 - this database right now only two names
09:59 - are there mark and John in my browser
10:04 - right so what I can do is I can simply
10:08 - Echo and just use this associative array
10:12 - and if you followed my last video you
10:14 - know that we can use the key of the
10:19 - associative array to get data so key
10:22 - here is the column name so I want to get
10:26 - the value of name column here right this
10:29 - is my table and there is a column called
10:31 - name and I want to get the values okay
10:35 - so the key will be
10:39 - the column name so I will write here
10:43 - name okay and I will just save it and
10:48 - once again I will go to my browser and
10:50 - refresh it and now you can see two names
10:55 - let
10:56 - me do a little bit better I will just
11:00 - concatenate this in
11:03 - break okay I'll will just give a Break
11:06 - Tag so that you can
11:10 - see okay and let me give break here also
11:18 - after query executed
11:22 - okay in here save it once again refresh
11:26 - it and now you can see your names here
11:30 - right which are there from uh in the
11:32 - database okay so we have name Mark and
11:37 - John in the database and we are seeing
11:40 - those names from the database in this
11:43 - web browser let's add a new data in the
11:46 - database so what I'm going to do I'm
11:50 - going to go to the
11:52 - structure not to the structure but
11:55 - insert tag here so I will go to the
11:58 - insert tag and I
12:01 - will I will add some more data so for
12:06 - example new
12:08 - name and
12:14 - surname and
12:18 - age and
12:21 - username and
12:25 - password okay and I will click go and
12:29 - data is saved I can browse I can go to
12:32 - this browse tab I can see there is a new
12:35 - data here right now I can refresh
12:38 - it and you will be able to see the third
12:41 - name here which is added here right so
12:44 - you know that whatever is in the
12:47 - database you are getting it here now
12:50 - let's uh take a little
12:54 - table so if you know HTML you know how
12:58 - to uh make a table right or otherwise if
13:01 - you don't know how to make a table using
13:03 - HTML just browse internet and you will
13:07 - be able to find
13:09 - many good uh tutorial there okay so what
13:14 - I'm going to do is I'm going to
13:17 - take Echo and I'm going to take table
13:22 - tags to create a table like structure
13:24 - for me right so what I'm going to do I'm
13:28 - going to take
13:29 - uh for example first of
13:33 - all uh tag called
13:36 - TR TR is the table row tag right if you
13:42 - remember and I will end this TR like
13:46 - this and inside this table row I'm going
13:50 - to insert
13:52 - some table data so just give
13:57 - two Brack
13:59 - like this and TD and I will just close
14:03 - this TD here TD right and in a similar
14:08 - way I'm going to just take two
14:13 - more or whatever number of columns you
14:17 - have and in here I can just insert this
14:22 - data okay so what I'm going to do I will
14:26 - copy this and I will just
14:29 - concatenate using
14:32 - concatenation I'll just insert it here
14:35 - right this will give us the
14:39 - name and then in the same way we can
14:44 - concatenate here the surname for example
14:48 - so
14:49 - just take the surname which is the
14:51 - second column name here called surname
14:56 - right so just write surname
15:02 - so for now I'm showing this these two
15:05 - rows you can take all the rows like this
15:08 - using this
15:09 - example and now I will just remove all
15:13 - the other TD for
15:22 - now so
15:24 - my table structure looks like this I
15:27 - will just commment this and let's see I
15:29 - can get the names and the surname inside
15:33 - the table or not save it and let's
15:36 - refresh
15:38 - it uh showing some error let's see
15:41 - what's the error probably some
15:43 - concatenation
15:49 - error oh I forgot the table tag without
15:53 - table tag we cannot use TR and TD right
15:57 - I'll will give
15:59 - table start here and at the end of this
16:02 - row I will give table
16:09 - end okay so I have this tags and I will
16:12 - just save
16:13 - it and now let's try and run the
16:18 - program and we see this here uh the name
16:22 - and surname right according to this
16:24 - table name is Mark and surname is this
16:27 - John and surname Julie and surname so
16:31 - you can see here but still you don't see
16:34 - some padding so we require this some
16:36 - padding in the table so just
16:40 - give border for example is equal
16:44 - to
16:46 - one
16:49 - and let's give width
16:53 - here
16:55 - withd or style for example
17:00 - style is equal
17:02 - to in the brackets
17:07 - give
17:10 - with colon
17:14 - 300px
17:16 - okay so let's save it run
17:20 - it and now you can see the table and the
17:24 - name and surname so you can play with
17:27 - the HTML tags
17:29 - what I wanted to say is you can play
17:31 - with HTML tags to create a table like
17:35 - this right so in this video you can get
17:40 - any data which is present in your
17:43 - database in your PHP script and show it
17:47 - like this
17:49 - right now um that's it I think for this
17:54 - video in the next or in the couple of
17:57 - next video I'm going to show you how to
18:00 - use this MySQL with PHP more
18:03 - interactively so stay tuned and please
18:06 - wait coming and subscribe and bye for
18:07 - now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how you can connect your PHP script to the mySQL database using PHP my admin right so we were having this database called student and we were able to connect to this database in the last video now in this video I'm going to show you how you can get the data so we had uh this student database and we created a us info if you remember and it has some data right and I want to show all this data uh on the browser or using PHP right so how can I show this in this video I'm going to show you so let's get started this is the connect. PHP which I have created uh in the last video and I'm going to use this uh connect. PHP to connect to the database and then I will create a new file and I will save it as get data.php and I will save it and in here I will just include my PHP tags and now first of all I need to connect to the database in this file right so what I'm going to do is in this file I have written the code to connect to the database which is connect. PHP so I will just require this file so I will use this keyword called require and the name of my connect file which is connect. PHP right so this is this file which I have written in the last video okay once I have this file then what I'm going to do is I will write a query to get the data from the database so I will declare a variable called query is equal to and inside this I am going to write a query as a string now if you know a little bit of my SQL you already know what a query is query is a small little string which you can send to your database to query the data from the database right for example I have this uh table called user info and I want the data from the table for example this data which I have saved earlier in the database base and I want to query this data from the database base so what can I do is if you don't know about SQL queries uh I'll show you a simple way so just select your table in which you have saved your data and go to the structure here we will go to this SQL tab here okay so this is the tab you need to go once you selected your table right and you will see a query here which is a simple query to get the data from the database this is Select star or estx from your table name this is a simple query so I'm going to use the same simple query to get the data from the database in this video okay so I will just copy this I will leave this where clause for now I will just use this this query okay so just copy this query select estx from your table name table name is user info so this is user info and I will just copy it here okay so this will be my query simple query and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a while loop while because I want to read the data once uh I um execute this query right so so what I'm going to do is first of all let's execute the query first so I'm going to give if condition and I want to check whether if this query is executed or not right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to um make a variable called um is very run for example you can give any variable name is equal to and now I'm going to use a function in my SQL so which fetches the data or which executes the query so just write MySQL underscore query okay this is the function in PHP which you from which you can execute your query and what it does it returns Boolean value so if the query is executed it will return true and we will go to the condition or statement inside if condition otherwise if it's um not executed it will return false and we will be able to catch the else condition right now I'm going to pass my query which is this one to my MySQL Query function function right now once this query is executed I can echo echo for now query executive for example okay else I can just show else I can just say qu not executed right so let's see if we are able to execute our query or not and then we will get the data from the database and show it okay I save it and I will go to Local Host and to my folder and then database and in here this was the file I have made right get data and it says connection successful P or connection success which comes from this file connect file which says connection success for now I'm going to comment this out so I don't need to see this uh connection success and I will save it and I will refresh it and now it says query executed so now I know that my query is successfully executed this query right now once the query is Su successfully executed what I want is I want to get the data okay so that this I can use by using while loop while and why I'm using the while loop I will show you because I want to fetch the data from the database and it will be an associative array Okay so what function we can use to get the data let's see so I I will declare a variable called very uh UND underscore excute is equal to this is a variable name right and we will use my SQL underscore fetch ass source as o C which means associative array right and in this function MySQL fetch as o we will pass our qu run okay this one this variable so just copy this and pass it here and once we have our we will execute this function it will return the data in the form of associative array in this variable okay so what we can do is we can just cut this from here and just paste it inside as a argument of our y Loop so we have our associative array here right in this variable okay so now what I can do is I can get get uh this or I can call this uh associative array variable to get the data so for example I want to get all the names from this user inut table so I have this user input table in my database and I have the column like ID name surname age username and password so I want to show all the names from this database right now only two names are there mark and John in my browser right so what I can do is I can simply Echo and just use this associative array and if you followed my last video you know that we can use the key of the associative array to get data so key here is the column name so I want to get the value of name column here right this is my table and there is a column called name and I want to get the values okay so the key will be the column name so I will write here name okay and I will just save it and once again I will go to my browser and refresh it and now you can see two names let me do a little bit better I will just concatenate this in break okay I'll will just give a Break Tag so that you can see okay and let me give break here also after query executed okay in here save it once again refresh it and now you can see your names here right which are there from uh in the database okay so we have name Mark and John in the database and we are seeing those names from the database in this web browser let's add a new data in the database so what I'm going to do I'm going to go to the structure not to the structure but insert tag here so I will go to the insert tag and I will I will add some more data so for example new name and surname and age and username and password okay and I will click go and data is saved I can browse I can go to this browse tab I can see there is a new data here right now I can refresh it and you will be able to see the third name here which is added here right so you know that whatever is in the database you are getting it here now let's uh take a little table so if you know HTML you know how to uh make a table right or otherwise if you don't know how to make a table using HTML just browse internet and you will be able to find many good uh tutorial there okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take Echo and I'm going to take table tags to create a table like structure for me right so what I'm going to do I'm going to take uh for example first of all uh tag called TR TR is the table row tag right if you remember and I will end this TR like this and inside this table row I'm going to insert some table data so just give two Brack like this and TD and I will just close this TD here TD right and in a similar way I'm going to just take two more or whatever number of columns you have and in here I can just insert this data okay so what I'm going to do I will copy this and I will just concatenate using concatenation I'll just insert it here right this will give us the name and then in the same way we can concatenate here the surname for example so just take the surname which is the second column name here called surname right so just write surname so for now I'm showing this these two rows you can take all the rows like this using this example and now I will just remove all the other TD for now so my table structure looks like this I will just commment this and let's see I can get the names and the surname inside the table or not save it and let's refresh it uh showing some error let's see what's the error probably some concatenation error oh I forgot the table tag without table tag we cannot use TR and TD right I'll will give table start here and at the end of this row I will give table end okay so I have this tags and I will just save it and now let's try and run the program and we see this here uh the name and surname right according to this table name is Mark and surname is this John and surname Julie and surname so you can see here but still you don't see some padding so we require this some padding in the table so just give border for example is equal to one and let's give width here withd or style for example style is equal to in the brackets give with colon 300px okay so let's save it run it and now you can see the table and the name and surname so you can play with the HTML tags what I wanted to say is you can play with HTML tags to create a table like this right so in this video you can get any data which is present in your database in your PHP script and show it like this right now um that's it I think for this video in the next or in the couple of next video I'm going to show you how to use this MySQL with PHP more interactively so stay tuned and please wait coming and subscribe and bye for now
