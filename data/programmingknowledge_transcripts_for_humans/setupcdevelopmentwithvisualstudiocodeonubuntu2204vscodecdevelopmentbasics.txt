00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can add the support for GCC
00:04 - and G plus plus on your Visual Studio
00:07 - code editor
00:09 - so first of all you need to have the GCC
00:11 - and G plus plus compiler on your Ubuntu
00:14 - operating system so let me show you how
00:17 - you can add the support for GCC and G
00:20 - plus plus and then we are going to see
00:23 - how we can set GCC and C plus plus uh
00:27 - compiler on our Visual Studio code
00:30 - editor so using GCC you can compile C
00:34 - programs and using G plus plus you can
00:37 - compile C plus plus programs on your
00:40 - Ubuntu operating system so let's see how
00:43 - we can add the support for both of these
00:47 - compilers so first of all you need to
00:49 - open your terminal you can open the
00:51 - terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t
00:55 - at the same time or you can go to
00:59 - Applications and then open the terminal
01:01 - from here also once the terminal is open
01:04 - you need to give these two commands so
01:07 - the first command is sudo apt
01:11 - update and then press enter and then
01:14 - give your ubuntu's password which you
01:17 - use to login to your Ubuntu operating
01:21 - system
01:22 - so what this command is going to do is
01:24 - it's going to update the package index
01:28 - on your Ubuntu operating system just
01:31 - wait for this command to finish so once
01:34 - this command is finished let me clear
01:36 - the terminal you can clear the terminal
01:39 - by giving this command clear and then
01:42 - press enter which is going to basically
01:45 - clear your terminal right so the First
01:48 - Command was sudo apt update once this
01:51 - command is finished the second command
01:54 - we need to give here is sudo apt install
01:58 - build Essentials so this command is
02:01 - going to install the build essential
02:03 - development package which automatically
02:07 - adds the support for GCC and G plus plus
02:10 - right so just give this command sudo apt
02:13 - install build essential and then press
02:14 - enter
02:15 - and then press y to continue and then
02:19 - press enter
02:20 - and just wait for this command to finish
02:23 - so once these two commands finished
02:26 - successfully let me clear the terminal
02:28 - and now you can give the GCC command or
02:32 - G plus plus command to test that
02:34 - so to test the version of GCC you have
02:38 - on your Ubuntu operating system you can
02:40 - just write this command GCC hyphen
02:43 - hyphen
02:45 - version and then press enter and it's
02:47 - going to give you some outputs like this
02:50 - right so it says GCC
02:52 - Ubuntu and then the version of GCC which
02:56 - we have installed is 11.3.0 similarly
03:01 - you can check the version of G plus plus
03:03 - so just write G plus plus hyphen hyphen
03:06 - version and it's also going to give you
03:09 - the version of G plus plus on your
03:12 - Ubuntu operating system so once you have
03:15 - installed GCC and G plus plus using
03:18 - build Essentials
03:20 - let's create a very simple C plus plus
03:23 - file let's say and check whether it's
03:26 - working using visual studio code
03:29 - now
03:31 - just open your terminal once again so
03:33 - just press Ctrl alt T to open the
03:36 - terminal and let's say I want to create
03:40 - a folder which will be called let's say
03:43 - work folder right so I'm going to just
03:45 - write mkdir and then name my folder as
03:49 - work right and then press enter and when
03:53 - you give LS command you can see this
03:55 - work folder is created so now
03:59 - I can either write code and then the
04:03 - name of the folder which is work and
04:06 - then press enter and it's going to open
04:08 - this work folder
04:10 - in Visual Studio code editor so you can
04:14 - see this folder is opened in Visual
04:17 - Studio code
04:18 - so you can either give this command to
04:21 - open this folder in Visual Studio code
04:25 - or what you can do you can give CD and
04:30 - then you can see the into your work
04:33 - folder and inside your folder where you
04:37 - want to create or see your C plus plus
04:39 - programs you can just write code and
04:43 - then space dot okay so once you go
04:46 - inside your folder you can just give
04:48 - code space Dot
04:50 - if you want to open any folder using
04:53 - visual studio code you need to write
04:55 - code and that path of your folder right
04:59 - so because the path of the work folder
05:04 - is was in the current directory itself
05:07 - so I have written work
05:10 - once you are inside the folder using CD
05:13 - command you can just give code space dot
05:17 - in order to open that folder right so I
05:22 - have given code space Dot and once again
05:24 - it's going to open the same work folder
05:27 - once this work folder is created
05:30 - you can create a new file by just
05:34 - clicking on this
05:37 - new file icon or you can click on file
05:41 - and then new file and then create a new
05:43 - file okay so let me create a c plus file
05:47 - here
05:48 - and here if you see this kind of warning
05:50 - you can just
05:52 - check this checkbox and click on yes I
05:54 - trust the author right
05:57 - so let's create a new file
05:59 - by clicking on this option and then I'm
06:02 - going to name my file as test.cpp
06:06 - you can also give the extension test.cc
06:09 - to your C plus file but for Simplicity
06:12 - I'm going to name my extension as test
06:17 - dot CPP
06:19 - so just press enter and this file will
06:21 - be created as soon as you create a cpb
06:27 - file Visual Studio code recognizes that
06:29 - you are trying to create a C plus plus
06:32 - program and it's going to suggest you to
06:37 - install some
06:39 - extensions so you can see do you want to
06:42 - install the recommended C and C plus
06:45 - plus extension pack and this extension
06:48 - is from Microsoft itself which is the
06:50 - company behind Visual Studio code right
06:53 - you can either click on
06:56 - install here or you can click on show
06:58 - recommendations let me click on show
07:01 - recommendations here
07:03 - and what it's going to do is it's going
07:06 - to show me all the C and C plus
07:08 - recommendations
07:10 - in the extensions tab right if you don't
07:15 - see any recommendation or if you don't
07:18 - see any pop-up here let me just close
07:20 - this and let's say you don't see any
07:23 - pop-up
07:25 - when you create your test.cpp file you
07:27 - can click on this extensions section
07:30 - here and here you can just write C and
07:34 - then press enter and it's going to also
07:36 - give you the popular extension for C
07:40 - language or you can write C plus plus
07:42 - and it's going to give you the popular
07:44 - extension for C plus plus language
07:48 - the top extension is generally the most
07:51 - popular and most trusted so just click
07:54 - on the top option and then you can see
07:57 - who is the developer of this extension
08:00 - as you can see it's developed by
08:02 - Microsoft
08:04 - and how many downloads are there right
08:07 - so it has around
08:10 - 47.8 million downloads at the time of
08:13 - making this video
08:14 - just click on install which is going to
08:16 - install this extension which means that
08:20 - Visual Studio code will add the support
08:22 - for C and C plus plus
08:25 - and
08:26 - what does this do so you can see what
08:30 - are the features it gives you
08:32 - intellisense debugging capability and
08:36 - many other good features on your Visual
08:39 - Studio code for C and C plus plus once
08:43 - this extension is installed you will be
08:46 - able to see disable uninstall and switch
08:49 - to pre-release buttons If you want to
08:53 - uninstall this extension at any time you
08:55 - can uninstall it by using uninstall
08:58 - button
08:59 - so now this extension is installed right
09:02 - let's close this and go to our c plus
09:04 - file
09:06 - and you can also click on the Explorer
09:08 - option for now where you can see the
09:11 - name of all the files inside your work
09:13 - folder
09:14 - now let's create a very simple C plus
09:17 - plus program in order to compile it so
09:20 - I'm going to just write a very simple C
09:23 - plus plus program C plus plus program
09:25 - you can find anywhere on internet so I'm
09:27 - not going to show you how to write the C
09:29 - plus program
09:31 - just write a very basic C plus plus
09:34 - program this program is just printing
09:36 - hello world right so in order to compile
09:39 - and run your program just click on this
09:41 - small arrow in front of this icon and
09:44 - then click on run C and C plus plus file
09:47 - which is going to ask you to choose your
09:50 - compiler
09:52 - and once you have added the compiler
09:55 - using the build Essentials command you
09:58 - can see Visual Studio code detects your
10:02 - G plus plus compiler you can see here
10:06 - and you can choose this compiler so just
10:10 - choose the compiler which says G plus
10:12 - plus build and debug active file I'm
10:15 - going to just choose this one which is
10:17 - going to choose my compiler and then
10:20 - it's going to compile my C plus file and
10:24 - it's going to give me the output of that
10:27 - c plus file
10:29 - now you can see
10:31 - everything is worked successfully
10:35 - and
10:36 - there is this new file which is created
10:39 - which is called test right so generally
10:43 - when you compile a C plus plus program
10:47 - it's going to create a binary file which
10:50 - is an executable file which you can run
10:52 - to get the output of your C plus file in
10:57 - our case it's going to print hello world
10:59 - right so the compilation is successful
11:02 - once the compilation is successful you
11:04 - will be able to see this icon is changed
11:07 - now
11:08 - and here it says run C or C plus plus
11:11 - file so once again click on this uh
11:16 - icon and this time you will see that the
11:22 - output is printed here which is hello
11:25 - world if you want to uh run your
11:28 - executable file manually you can click
11:31 - on this plus sign here which is going to
11:33 - open a new bash terminal or if you have
11:37 - multiple terminal versions you will see
11:41 - those bash or let's say zsh or shell
11:46 - here listed right so you can open that
11:49 - particular uh terminal using this option
11:54 - right here you can just write dot
11:57 - forward slash and the name of your
11:59 - executable file in our case it's test
12:02 - right this output is test right so dot
12:06 - forward slash test and then press enter
12:08 - and it's going to give us the
12:12 - output of our executable file which is
12:15 - hello world so using this button you can
12:20 - either debug your file or run your file
12:24 - so let's try to debug our file so let's
12:27 - modify this C plus pro program a little
12:30 - so I'm going to declare three variables
12:32 - num1
12:34 - comma num 2 comma sum so basically what
12:40 - I want to do here is I want to uh
12:44 - do or have the sum of two numbers right
12:49 - then I'm going to just say
12:53 - num 1 is equal to 10 let's say num 2 is
13:00 - equal to 20 and then
13:03 - the sum will be the addition of num 1
13:09 - plus num 2 okay
13:13 - so I have added this logic so that I can
13:16 - explain you the debugging once you have
13:20 - changed your code just press Ctrl s to
13:23 - save your file
13:24 - and then let's add a breakpoint here
13:27 - here here here and here okay
13:31 - so in order to add the breakpoint you
13:33 - can just go here where you will see red
13:36 - dot just click on that and the
13:38 - breakpoint is added
13:41 - you can also go to this debug section so
13:44 - just click on debug and here you will
13:46 - see all the breakpoints which you have
13:49 - added you can disable those breakpoints
13:53 - or just toggle active breakpoints from
13:57 - here
13:59 - or completely add a new breakpoint
14:03 - so the list of breakpoints are listed
14:06 - here
14:07 - you can click on run and debug from here
14:09 - also or you can click on the boxes or C
14:13 - plus plus from here also I'm going to
14:15 - click this option which is going to
14:18 - start the debugging of my file right so
14:21 - you can see the debugging has been
14:23 - started
14:24 - now if you know your C plus plus
14:26 - programs when you declare any variables
14:31 - without the initialization
14:33 - first of all they take some garbage
14:36 - value right so this is what is happening
14:39 - here number one have this garbage value
14:42 - of 32
14:45 - 767 num2 also have the garbage value and
14:49 - then some also have the garbage value
14:51 - right let's move forward in this
14:55 - debugging logic you will also see when
14:58 - you start the debugging these buttons on
15:01 - the top first button is for continue
15:04 - second is for step over
15:06 - third is for step into fourth is for
15:09 - step out and then you can restart your
15:12 - debugging or stop your debugging using
15:14 - these two buttons let's tap over so I'm
15:17 - going to click on step over
15:19 - and then
15:21 - once we step over that means this line
15:24 - of code has been executed the program
15:26 - execution stops on the next line once
15:30 - this line of code is executed you can
15:33 - see num1 is equal to 10 because now we
15:36 - have assigned a value to num1 earlier it
15:40 - has the garbage value but num2 value
15:43 - stays the same because this line of code
15:46 - is not executed so let's move forward
15:49 - now this line of code is executed so
15:51 - num2 is 20 but still the sum is the
15:55 - garbage value because our program
15:57 - execution stops at this line of code
16:00 - once we move forward
16:02 - this line of code is executed and the
16:06 - value here is 30 right 10 plus 20 is
16:09 - equal to 30 you will be able to see that
16:12 - value here right let's move forward
16:16 - and now
16:17 - the hello world will be printed for
16:21 - example
16:22 - and then you can move forward here and
16:26 - then program is
16:28 - fully executed right you can also see
16:31 - the debug console here and the output of
16:36 - your program or what's happening in your
16:39 - debug console everything you will be
16:41 - able to see here okay
16:45 - so this is how you can run your code
16:50 - debug your code and compile and execute
16:54 - your code on your Ubuntu operating
16:58 - system using visual studio code editor I
17:01 - hope you enjoyed this video and I will
17:03 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can add the support for GCC and G plus plus on your Visual Studio code editor so first of all you need to have the GCC and G plus plus compiler on your Ubuntu operating system so let me show you how you can add the support for GCC and G plus plus and then we are going to see how we can set GCC and C plus plus uh compiler on our Visual Studio code editor so using GCC you can compile C programs and using G plus plus you can compile C plus plus programs on your Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can add the support for both of these compilers so first of all you need to open your terminal you can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl alt t at the same time or you can go to Applications and then open the terminal from here also once the terminal is open you need to give these two commands so the first command is sudo apt update and then press enter and then give your ubuntu's password which you use to login to your Ubuntu operating system so what this command is going to do is it's going to update the package index on your Ubuntu operating system just wait for this command to finish so once this command is finished let me clear the terminal you can clear the terminal by giving this command clear and then press enter which is going to basically clear your terminal right so the First Command was sudo apt update once this command is finished the second command we need to give here is sudo apt install build Essentials so this command is going to install the build essential development package which automatically adds the support for GCC and G plus plus right so just give this command sudo apt install build essential and then press enter and then press y to continue and then press enter and just wait for this command to finish so once these two commands finished successfully let me clear the terminal and now you can give the GCC command or G plus plus command to test that so to test the version of GCC you have on your Ubuntu operating system you can just write this command GCC hyphen hyphen version and then press enter and it's going to give you some outputs like this right so it says GCC Ubuntu and then the version of GCC which we have installed is 11.3.0 similarly you can check the version of G plus plus so just write G plus plus hyphen hyphen version and it's also going to give you the version of G plus plus on your Ubuntu operating system so once you have installed GCC and G plus plus using build Essentials let's create a very simple C plus plus file let's say and check whether it's working using visual studio code now just open your terminal once again so just press Ctrl alt T to open the terminal and let's say I want to create a folder which will be called let's say work folder right so I'm going to just write mkdir and then name my folder as work right and then press enter and when you give LS command you can see this work folder is created so now I can either write code and then the name of the folder which is work and then press enter and it's going to open this work folder in Visual Studio code editor so you can see this folder is opened in Visual Studio code so you can either give this command to open this folder in Visual Studio code or what you can do you can give CD and then you can see the into your work folder and inside your folder where you want to create or see your C plus plus programs you can just write code and then space dot okay so once you go inside your folder you can just give code space Dot if you want to open any folder using visual studio code you need to write code and that path of your folder right so because the path of the work folder is was in the current directory itself so I have written work once you are inside the folder using CD command you can just give code space dot in order to open that folder right so I have given code space Dot and once again it's going to open the same work folder once this work folder is created you can create a new file by just clicking on this new file icon or you can click on file and then new file and then create a new file okay so let me create a c plus file here and here if you see this kind of warning you can just check this checkbox and click on yes I trust the author right so let's create a new file by clicking on this option and then I'm going to name my file as test.cpp you can also give the extension test.cc to your C plus file but for Simplicity I'm going to name my extension as test dot CPP so just press enter and this file will be created as soon as you create a cpb file Visual Studio code recognizes that you are trying to create a C plus plus program and it's going to suggest you to install some extensions so you can see do you want to install the recommended C and C plus plus extension pack and this extension is from Microsoft itself which is the company behind Visual Studio code right you can either click on install here or you can click on show recommendations let me click on show recommendations here and what it's going to do is it's going to show me all the C and C plus recommendations in the extensions tab right if you don't see any recommendation or if you don't see any popup here let me just close this and let's say you don't see any popup when you create your test.cpp file you can click on this extensions section here and here you can just write C and then press enter and it's going to also give you the popular extension for C language or you can write C plus plus and it's going to give you the popular extension for C plus plus language the top extension is generally the most popular and most trusted so just click on the top option and then you can see who is the developer of this extension as you can see it's developed by Microsoft and how many downloads are there right so it has around 47.8 million downloads at the time of making this video just click on install which is going to install this extension which means that Visual Studio code will add the support for C and C plus plus and what does this do so you can see what are the features it gives you intellisense debugging capability and many other good features on your Visual Studio code for C and C plus plus once this extension is installed you will be able to see disable uninstall and switch to prerelease buttons If you want to uninstall this extension at any time you can uninstall it by using uninstall button so now this extension is installed right let's close this and go to our c plus file and you can also click on the Explorer option for now where you can see the name of all the files inside your work folder now let's create a very simple C plus plus program in order to compile it so I'm going to just write a very simple C plus plus program C plus plus program you can find anywhere on internet so I'm not going to show you how to write the C plus program just write a very basic C plus plus program this program is just printing hello world right so in order to compile and run your program just click on this small arrow in front of this icon and then click on run C and C plus plus file which is going to ask you to choose your compiler and once you have added the compiler using the build Essentials command you can see Visual Studio code detects your G plus plus compiler you can see here and you can choose this compiler so just choose the compiler which says G plus plus build and debug active file I'm going to just choose this one which is going to choose my compiler and then it's going to compile my C plus file and it's going to give me the output of that c plus file now you can see everything is worked successfully and there is this new file which is created which is called test right so generally when you compile a C plus plus program it's going to create a binary file which is an executable file which you can run to get the output of your C plus file in our case it's going to print hello world right so the compilation is successful once the compilation is successful you will be able to see this icon is changed now and here it says run C or C plus plus file so once again click on this uh icon and this time you will see that the output is printed here which is hello world if you want to uh run your executable file manually you can click on this plus sign here which is going to open a new bash terminal or if you have multiple terminal versions you will see those bash or let's say zsh or shell here listed right so you can open that particular uh terminal using this option right here you can just write dot forward slash and the name of your executable file in our case it's test right this output is test right so dot forward slash test and then press enter and it's going to give us the output of our executable file which is hello world so using this button you can either debug your file or run your file so let's try to debug our file so let's modify this C plus pro program a little so I'm going to declare three variables num1 comma num 2 comma sum so basically what I want to do here is I want to uh do or have the sum of two numbers right then I'm going to just say num 1 is equal to 10 let's say num 2 is equal to 20 and then the sum will be the addition of num 1 plus num 2 okay so I have added this logic so that I can explain you the debugging once you have changed your code just press Ctrl s to save your file and then let's add a breakpoint here here here here and here okay so in order to add the breakpoint you can just go here where you will see red dot just click on that and the breakpoint is added you can also go to this debug section so just click on debug and here you will see all the breakpoints which you have added you can disable those breakpoints or just toggle active breakpoints from here or completely add a new breakpoint so the list of breakpoints are listed here you can click on run and debug from here also or you can click on the boxes or C plus plus from here also I'm going to click this option which is going to start the debugging of my file right so you can see the debugging has been started now if you know your C plus plus programs when you declare any variables without the initialization first of all they take some garbage value right so this is what is happening here number one have this garbage value of 32 767 num2 also have the garbage value and then some also have the garbage value right let's move forward in this debugging logic you will also see when you start the debugging these buttons on the top first button is for continue second is for step over third is for step into fourth is for step out and then you can restart your debugging or stop your debugging using these two buttons let's tap over so I'm going to click on step over and then once we step over that means this line of code has been executed the program execution stops on the next line once this line of code is executed you can see num1 is equal to 10 because now we have assigned a value to num1 earlier it has the garbage value but num2 value stays the same because this line of code is not executed so let's move forward now this line of code is executed so num2 is 20 but still the sum is the garbage value because our program execution stops at this line of code once we move forward this line of code is executed and the value here is 30 right 10 plus 20 is equal to 30 you will be able to see that value here right let's move forward and now the hello world will be printed for example and then you can move forward here and then program is fully executed right you can also see the debug console here and the output of your program or what's happening in your debug console everything you will be able to see here okay so this is how you can run your code debug your code and compile and execute your code on your Ubuntu operating system using visual studio code editor I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
