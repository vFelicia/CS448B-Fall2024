00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video this is John from programming
00:05 - knowledge and in this video guys we're
00:07 - gonna learn how to use arrays inside our
00:09 - C program
00:11 - so basically guess we can declare
00:13 - variables to hold single element or
00:16 - single value inside our C program so
00:18 - very simple like this each or in page
00:22 - and then we could assign it to evaluate
00:27 - for example like this so this particular
00:30 - variable will hold the value 5 for a
00:34 - single value file and then it's going to
00:38 - assign to the variable age now what if
00:42 - you want to store like 50 series of
00:46 - values like there are 50 each now what
00:53 - are that we want to say for example
00:55 - there are like 50 persons that we want
00:58 - to save the ages then this particular
01:01 - declaration and statement will not
01:04 - suffice because we're going to like
01:07 - declare it one by one so for example
01:10 - each age 2 and then 6 and then in H 3
01:16 - equal 7 and in age 4 was like 10 and so
01:26 - on so basically guys this is not a good
01:29 - programming practice to declare multiple
01:32 - variables or yeah multiple variables to
01:36 - hold a single set or single type of data
01:39 - so that's why we need the capability of
01:43 - an array so basically guys the array is
01:47 - a data structure in the programming
01:49 - which can store a fixed size sequential
01:53 - collection of elements of the same data
01:56 - type so in this case guys were just you
01:59 - know collecting and saving the same data
02:03 - type of data which is in now what we can
02:06 - do here is we can define an array and
02:10 - then we could set the
02:12 - say for example we want to save 50 ages
02:16 - right and then we can save the age into
02:20 - that particular array so let me show you
02:22 - an example so this is how you can create
02:26 - an array inside your C program so
02:29 - basically the first thing is you have to
02:33 - specify the type of your data that you
02:36 - want to save in that particular array
02:38 - and then the array name so basically
02:41 - this is just like the variable name so
02:44 - you have to label your container and
02:47 - then of course you have to specify or
02:50 - specify the type of data that you want
02:52 - to save in this particular array and
02:54 - then you have to add the square brackets
02:57 - and this signifies that this particular
03:00 - variable is an array and then inside
03:04 - this particular square bracket you can
03:07 - declare the size or you know specify the
03:10 - size or how many values that this
03:14 - particular variable could hold okay so
03:17 - in a typical C program you can do it
03:22 - like this
03:22 - for example the type is int right and
03:25 - then you can say ages or age right so
03:30 - this is the re name and then this square
03:33 - brackets and then you have to specify
03:36 - the size for example five so you want to
03:40 - collect five values or five age five
03:45 - percents okay so then this is the type
03:48 - int you have to specify the type and
03:50 - then you have to specify the re name
03:52 - they be variable name and then of course
03:55 - square brackets and then the size of
03:59 - your array or basically the amount of
04:04 - values that this particular array could
04:06 - hold so after this you can say equals
04:09 - and then you can specify the array or
04:12 - the elements of your array so for
04:15 - example we could take all this values 5
04:18 - 6 7 and 10 so
04:21 - five six seven and ten and for example
04:28 - because our array contains or should
04:30 - contain 5 elements you can add another
04:33 - one here for example 8 or something ok
04:39 - so again this is how you can take an
04:42 - array of values so E is the data type
04:48 - and then of course we have the re name
04:50 - and then square brackets with the size 5
04:54 - for example your array should be 5 and
04:59 - then equals and then the curly braces
05:02 - open and close curly braces and then the
05:05 - actual element value for example in this
05:08 - particular statement we have 5 6 7 10
05:14 - and 8 so that's how you can initialize
05:17 - an array in c program now you can access
05:23 - this particular or this elements or
05:27 - these values by using what we call index
05:31 - so in c programming or any other
05:34 - programming with arrays you can access
05:38 - the values by using index so this index
05:43 - is 0 things 0 based it means that it
05:48 - will start it will start with 0 ok so
05:54 - meaning if you want to access the value
05:58 - 5 so you have to use 0 index
06:02 - okay this will be 0 and then this will
06:11 - be 1 this will be 2 this will be 3 then
06:17 - this will be 4 so again if you want to
06:22 - access or get the value this particular
06:25 - element you have to use 0 value of your
06:29 - index and then one for the 6 2 4 7 3
06:34 - for ten four for eight so let me show
06:38 - you that how that works so for example
06:43 - you want to display the value 6 okay so
06:47 - all you have to do is use the printf
06:50 - statement and then double quotes and
06:54 - then % be the format specifier for our
06:59 - integer values and then comma of course
07:02 - and then use the name of our what we
07:09 - call this our a so ages and then we can
07:14 - specify the square bracket and then
07:17 - index of the element of you want to use
07:20 - the first sample six so we want to use
07:24 - the index 1 for that to be able to get
07:26 - the running on 6 so let's try this build
07:32 - and run our program so as you can see
07:35 - the output is 6 as you can see here 6
07:40 - right now if you want to get the value
07:42 - then you have to use the index 3 for
07:49 - that because I as I said the value in
07:53 - the index 3 of our particular array so
07:58 - field and run our program and it should
08:01 - output the value 10 which sits on the
08:06 - index 3 of our array so that's how you
08:09 - can access the value for moiré now super
08:13 - example you want to change the value of
08:15 - this array right so we have here 5 6 7 8
08:19 - or 5 6 7 10 and 8 and then if you if you
08:22 - want to change the value of super
08:25 - example this one find the first element
08:27 - all you have to do is specify the index
08:30 - also so leave this
08:42 - find student : let's depart you just so
08:49 - for example we want in this place what
08:52 - will be the value of our index zero so
08:57 - we could test that by using the printf
08:59 - statement and then instead of three you
09:02 - can specify the value zero or index zero
09:06 - here so let's try this field and run and
09:10 - as you can see here instead of five the
09:13 - initial value of our index zero
09:18 - it returns eleven because we assigned it
09:22 - or we modify it by using element or
09:25 - index zero equal to KI eleven riches
09:30 - that's why we are getting the eleven
09:33 - value here now this is particularly
09:36 - useful guys or if you want to work with
09:38 - the array one of the best start for the
09:44 - best statement that you could use to
09:46 - write array the array is by using the
09:49 - for loops or loops inside our C program
09:52 - so we could say this here for example
09:55 - for so we're gonna use the for loop
10:00 - statement here and we can specify for
10:02 - example int index equal to zero
10:08 - do you want to start with zero because
10:11 - as I said the index of our array is zero
10:14 - base it will start with the zero number
10:18 - okay so index equals zero and then see
10:22 - me : and we're going to say here here
10:25 - index less than the actual value of our
10:32 - array or the size of our array so five
10:36 - less than five so another semicolon and
10:41 - then index less was okay and inside the
10:47 - for loop we could display the element of
10:50 - our array so we could use this printf
10:53 - statement
10:55 - and then we could use the index variable
10:59 - here and then change this you could say
11:05 - index equals percent D D format
11:13 - specifier and then you could say equal
11:19 - to percent B and then of course the
11:24 - actual value of our array index so in
11:29 - here we could specify the index okay so
11:32 - it should display the index current
11:36 - index and then it should display the
11:38 - actual value of that particular index so
11:43 - we could give it and run our program
11:46 - that we add first the backslash N or
11:50 - newline step sequence new line and then
11:56 - it should display this particular output
11:59 - so at index 0 we have the value 11 at
12:04 - index 1 we have the value 6 right index
12:09 - 0 is 11 because we already modified our
12:13 - array specifying the array or index 0
12:17 - should be equal to 11 and then at index
12:20 - 1 equal to 6 right here index 2 should
12:24 - be equal to 7 index 3 is then index 4 is
12:28 - 8 okay so that's how easy for us to
12:31 - access and change the value or array and
12:35 - that's how we can define our entire I
12:39 - mean single dimension or one dimension
12:44 - array inside our C program and in the
12:47 - next video guys we're going to talk
12:48 - about two-dimensional and
12:50 - multi-dimensional arrays inside our c
12:53 - program so I think that's all there is
12:54 - very nice for in this tutorial if you
12:57 - have questions please let me know in the
13:00 - comment section do you know so then guys
13:01 - thank you for watching and see you in
13:03 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video this is John from programming knowledge and in this video guys we're gonna learn how to use arrays inside our C program so basically guess we can declare variables to hold single element or single value inside our C program so very simple like this each or in page and then we could assign it to evaluate for example like this so this particular variable will hold the value 5 for a single value file and then it's going to assign to the variable age now what if you want to store like 50 series of values like there are 50 each now what are that we want to say for example there are like 50 persons that we want to save the ages then this particular declaration and statement will not suffice because we're going to like declare it one by one so for example each age 2 and then 6 and then in H 3 equal 7 and in age 4 was like 10 and so on so basically guys this is not a good programming practice to declare multiple variables or yeah multiple variables to hold a single set or single type of data so that's why we need the capability of an array so basically guys the array is a data structure in the programming which can store a fixed size sequential collection of elements of the same data type so in this case guys were just you know collecting and saving the same data type of data which is in now what we can do here is we can define an array and then we could set the say for example we want to save 50 ages right and then we can save the age into that particular array so let me show you an example so this is how you can create an array inside your C program so basically the first thing is you have to specify the type of your data that you want to save in that particular array and then the array name so basically this is just like the variable name so you have to label your container and then of course you have to specify or specify the type of data that you want to save in this particular array and then you have to add the square brackets and this signifies that this particular variable is an array and then inside this particular square bracket you can declare the size or you know specify the size or how many values that this particular variable could hold okay so in a typical C program you can do it like this for example the type is int right and then you can say ages or age right so this is the re name and then this square brackets and then you have to specify the size for example five so you want to collect five values or five age five percents okay so then this is the type int you have to specify the type and then you have to specify the re name they be variable name and then of course square brackets and then the size of your array or basically the amount of values that this particular array could hold so after this you can say equals and then you can specify the array or the elements of your array so for example we could take all this values 5 6 7 and 10 so five six seven and ten and for example because our array contains or should contain 5 elements you can add another one here for example 8 or something ok so again this is how you can take an array of values so E is the data type and then of course we have the re name and then square brackets with the size 5 for example your array should be 5 and then equals and then the curly braces open and close curly braces and then the actual element value for example in this particular statement we have 5 6 7 10 and 8 so that's how you can initialize an array in c program now you can access this particular or this elements or these values by using what we call index so in c programming or any other programming with arrays you can access the values by using index so this index is 0 things 0 based it means that it will start it will start with 0 ok so meaning if you want to access the value 5 so you have to use 0 index okay this will be 0 and then this will be 1 this will be 2 this will be 3 then this will be 4 so again if you want to access or get the value this particular element you have to use 0 value of your index and then one for the 6 2 4 7 3 for ten four for eight so let me show you that how that works so for example you want to display the value 6 okay so all you have to do is use the printf statement and then double quotes and then % be the format specifier for our integer values and then comma of course and then use the name of our what we call this our a so ages and then we can specify the square bracket and then index of the element of you want to use the first sample six so we want to use the index 1 for that to be able to get the running on 6 so let's try this build and run our program so as you can see the output is 6 as you can see here 6 right now if you want to get the value then you have to use the index 3 for that because I as I said the value in the index 3 of our particular array so field and run our program and it should output the value 10 which sits on the index 3 of our array so that's how you can access the value for moiré now super example you want to change the value of this array right so we have here 5 6 7 8 or 5 6 7 10 and 8 and then if you if you want to change the value of super example this one find the first element all you have to do is specify the index also so leave this find student let's depart you just so for example we want in this place what will be the value of our index zero so we could test that by using the printf statement and then instead of three you can specify the value zero or index zero here so let's try this field and run and as you can see here instead of five the initial value of our index zero it returns eleven because we assigned it or we modify it by using element or index zero equal to KI eleven riches that's why we are getting the eleven value here now this is particularly useful guys or if you want to work with the array one of the best start for the best statement that you could use to write array the array is by using the for loops or loops inside our C program so we could say this here for example for so we're gonna use the for loop statement here and we can specify for example int index equal to zero do you want to start with zero because as I said the index of our array is zero base it will start with the zero number okay so index equals zero and then see me and we're going to say here here index less than the actual value of our array or the size of our array so five less than five so another semicolon and then index less was okay and inside the for loop we could display the element of our array so we could use this printf statement and then we could use the index variable here and then change this you could say index equals percent D D format specifier and then you could say equal to percent B and then of course the actual value of our array index so in here we could specify the index okay so it should display the index current index and then it should display the actual value of that particular index so we could give it and run our program that we add first the backslash N or newline step sequence new line and then it should display this particular output so at index 0 we have the value 11 at index 1 we have the value 6 right index 0 is 11 because we already modified our array specifying the array or index 0 should be equal to 11 and then at index 1 equal to 6 right here index 2 should be equal to 7 index 3 is then index 4 is 8 okay so that's how easy for us to access and change the value or array and that's how we can define our entire I mean single dimension or one dimension array inside our C program and in the next video guys we're going to talk about twodimensional and multidimensional arrays inside our c program so I think that's all there is very nice for in this tutorial if you have questions please let me know in the comment section do you know so then guys thank you for watching and see you in the next video
