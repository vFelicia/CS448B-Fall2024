00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - MongoDB on your Mac operating system so
00:07 - let's get started and let's see how we
00:09 - can download MongoDB so first of all
00:12 - just open your favorite browser and
00:13 - search for MongoDB and hopefully the
00:16 - first link which will appear here will
00:17 - be from
00:19 - MongoDB dot-com which is this one so I'm
00:23 - going to just click on that link and
00:24 - here this website MongoDB website keeps
00:29 - on changing so you just need to search
00:31 - for the Downloads button so at the time
00:34 - of making this video this button is at
00:36 - the top-right end of this website which
00:40 - is this one so I'm going to click on
00:42 - this download button and then we need to
00:45 - choose which version of MongoDB we want
00:49 - to download so we want the community
00:51 - server for MongoDB so just choose this
00:55 - option which says community server and
00:57 - then choose the OS X version right now
01:02 - here you have the option to download
01:04 - that tgz file which is the format of you
01:09 - know compression which is similar to the
01:11 - zip file if you are familiar with the
01:13 - zip files right so just click on this
01:16 - download button which is going to
01:18 - download the tgz file you can see this
01:21 - download for the tgz file is started so
01:25 - it's around 87 megabyte files so it will
01:28 - take some time to download so I'm going
01:30 - to just pause this video until this file
01:33 - is downloaded and once it's downloaded
01:35 - we are going to see how to extract it
01:37 - and how to install MongoDB so now this
01:39 - MongoDB tgz file is downloaded on my Mac
01:43 - operating system so what I'm going to do
01:45 - is I'm going to minimize the browser and
01:47 - now I'm going to open that terminal
01:50 - right so just open your terminal and
01:52 - once the terminal is open we are going
01:54 - to just CD to the
01:56 - Downloads folder where we have
02:00 - saved our DG's at friends so let me do
02:04 - LS to list all the content and you can
02:06 - see this file we have downloaded right
02:09 - so first of all we are going to extract
02:11 - this file because it's a zip file
02:14 - so to extract it you just need to give
02:15 - this command tar and then X Z F and then
02:21 - the name of your tar file which is
02:23 - MongoDB OS X SSL whatever version dot TG
02:27 - said right and then press Enter which is
02:30 - going to extract this tar file and once
02:33 - this star file is extracted we are going
02:35 - to just copy the content of this MongoDB
02:40 - folder to our user local folder so now
02:44 - the command is successful and we are
02:46 - going to do LS once again and you can
02:50 - see it has extracted this folder which
02:53 - is mom would be be OS X whatever version
02:55 - is right so this folder we just need to
02:59 - move this folder to the user local
03:02 - folder so the next is to move this
03:06 - folder so we will use the MV command all
03:09 - the command I'm going to give you in the
03:11 - description of this video so you can
03:13 - directly copy those come on and then
03:15 - paste it into your terminal also so MV
03:19 - and let's use sudo for it because we are
03:23 - going to copy it into the user local
03:26 - folder right so MV and then the name of
03:29 - your
03:30 - MongoDB
03:32 - folder and then the destination folder
03:35 - so the destination folder will be user
03:39 - local and then we will name our MongoDB
03:42 - folder as MongoDB so just write DB
03:47 - okay so this is the command to move this
03:51 - folder to the user local bin let me just
03:55 - maximize this terminal so we can see
03:58 - this command in a better way so this is
04:00 - the command to move just press ENTER and
04:03 - then give your max password I'm going to
04:06 - give my max password and now this
04:09 - command is successful let's list all the
04:11 - contents of this downloads folder once
04:13 - again so you can see only tgz file is
04:16 - remaining here we have already moved
04:18 - this folder to the user local MongoDB
04:23 - folder so let's CD to the user local
04:26 - MongoDB folder and let's see if we have
04:29 - this folder there or not so user local
04:33 - and then DB and then LS and you
04:38 - can see all the contents of this
04:42 - DB e a folder is transferred to use a
04:46 - local forward slash MongoDB okay so once
04:49 - this is done the next step is to create
04:53 - the forward slash data for a slash DB
04:57 - folder so by default DB writes or
05:01 - stores data into a folder called a four
05:05 - slash data for / DB and we need to
05:09 - create this folder right so we will just
05:14 - use the mkdir
05:15 - command to make this directory so we
05:19 - just use the pseudo first of all and
05:22 - then mkdir and then the flag - P and
05:28 - this flag will allow us to create the
05:33 - directory structure which is a forward
05:35 - slash data for /d B okay so sudo mkdir -
05:41 - p4 slash data for / DB + press enter and
05:46 - then you can just see if this
05:51 - directory is created or not so I'm going
05:54 - to just do CD or slash data and
06:01 - /d B and let's enter and we are inside
06:05 - this four slash data for / DB folder I
06:09 - have given double forward slash here by
06:12 - mistake but you can just just give this
06:16 - for / dat ax for / DV it will work fine
06:19 - also okay so I'm going to just do PWD
06:23 - which is present working directory and
06:25 - you can see we are inside this four
06:29 - slash data for / DB right so now the
06:32 - next step is to manually change the
06:34 - permission of this folder so to change
06:38 - the permission of this folder what we
06:40 - need to do is we you just need to give
06:42 - this command sudo and then we are going
06:44 - to give a CH own command and then
06:48 - whatever is your user name so to know
06:51 - your user name you just need to write
06:55 - Who am I and this is your user name in
07:01 - your case right so to change the
07:04 - permission of for /data /resource
07:13 - urn aim in my case it's code mine but in
07:17 - your case it will be different and then
07:21 - /data
07:23 - /index enter which is going to change
07:27 - the permission of this folder which is
07:31 - for /data
07:32 - /resource
07:37 - /name
07:43 - for now and let me just do CD so that
07:48 - i'm going to be in my home directory
07:52 - right so just to CD blank CD which is
07:56 - going to just redirect you to your home
07:59 - directory right so once you are in your
08:02 - home directory you can just do pwt and
08:06 - you will be in your users forward slash
08:09 - whatever you is your username right so
08:12 - you need to be in this directory and
08:14 - then you just need to open the bash
08:18 - profile file here so you can just do LS
08:22 - - l for example to list out all the
08:26 - files and let me do LS - L so it will
08:32 - just list out all the hidden files also
08:35 - so now I have done LS - L and you will
08:40 - be able to see this bash profile dot
08:44 - bash profile file here okay so the
08:47 - command was LS - al and if this dot bash
08:52 - profile file is not
08:55 - you can create this file using
08:58 - patch command so you can just give touch
09:01 - and then dot bash
09:04 - profile okay and then it's going to
09:08 - create this bash profile file if it's
09:10 - not plugin and if it's present then you
09:13 - just need to open it okay so you just
09:16 - need to open this dot bash profile so we
09:20 - are going to open this dot bash profile
09:22 - by giving this command give open and
09:25 - then dot bash
09:29 - profile and then press Enter which is
09:32 - going to open this bash profile file
09:34 - into your editor okay so you can see I
09:38 - have already created this dot bash
09:41 - profile and I have already exported some
09:44 - paths earlier for example for Java home
09:48 - or for node.js I'm I was working with
09:51 - node.js or so I had set those spots into
09:54 - my dot bash profile filum I want to add
09:58 - this new path for MongoDB into this dot
10:01 - bash profile right so the export which
10:06 - we want to do here is I have just copied
10:09 - down into a text editor which is these
10:13 - two lines of path we need to export okay
10:18 - so I'm going to also give these exports
10:20 - into the description of this video so
10:23 - you can directly copy those paths and
10:26 - just paste it into your bash profile
10:30 - file okay I'm going to just copy these
10:33 - paths which is export underscore
10:36 - path is equal to four slash user four
10:38 - slash local forward slash MongoDB and
10:41 - then export path is equal to part :
10:45 - dollar path for slash bin okay so
10:49 - just I'm going to copy this and I'm
10:52 - going to paste this at the end of my
10:55 - bash profile file and then I'm going to
10:57 - save it so I'm going to just save this
11:00 - file you can just go here and then save
11:04 - it or you can just give commands s to
11:08 - save it okay so once it's saved I'm
11:10 - going to close this file I'm going to
11:12 - minimize this and once I have added
11:15 - these exports I just need to restart my
11:20 - terminal or I can just give this command
11:24 - source and then dot bash profiler which
11:29 - is going to reload this mash profile for
11:31 - me okay so I have given this come on and
11:35 - once this is done I'm going to just
11:38 - close this terminal and let's just test
11:43 - where the MongoDB is really installed or
11:46 - not so I'm going to just open two
11:48 - terminals now so the first term and the
11:52 - second term so I have opened two
11:55 - terminal 1 terminal we need to run the
11:58 -  daemon and the other terminal we
12:02 - need to interact with the MongoDB ok so
12:06 - on one terminal you just need to write
12:09 -  D and then press ENTER and if you
12:13 - see this kind of output then you know
12:16 - that MongoDB is perfectly running fine
12:21 - and then you can connect to your MongoDB
12:24 - so to connect to your MongoDB you just
12:27 - need to give command here so just
12:30 - give mom go and then press ENTER and
12:34 - you are connected to your MongoDB ok so
12:38 - on one terminal I have given D
12:41 - command which is for the daemon to
12:45 - start and on the other terminal here I
12:48 - have given command which is going
12:50 - to start the interactive client
12:53 - right so this is on the left hand side
12:56 - is the Mongol client and here we can
12:58 - just write show for example show DBS so
13:03 - just write show DBS which is going to
13:05 - show all the databases which are already
13:08 - present by default into your
13:10 - database and then press ENTER and I can
13:13 - see there are two databases which is
13:16 - admin and local which are already there
13:18 - by default on my MongoDB server right
13:22 - in order to create MongoDB we can create
13:25 - it but we are going to see it later in
13:28 - this video I just wanted to show you how
13:30 - you can download and install
13:32 - MongoDB on your Mac operating system if
13:36 - you want to check the version of MongoDB
13:39 - you can just open the next terminal for
13:42 - example and you can just write for
13:46 - example
13:49 - -
13:50 - version then press Enter which is going
13:54 - to give you the version of MongoDB
13:56 - installed so in my case its version
13:59 - three point six point one right so in
14:03 - this way you can download and install
14:04 - MongoDB on your own Mac operating system
14:06 - I hope you enjoyed this video please
14:08 - rate comment subscribe and bye for now

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install MongoDB on your Mac operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can download MongoDB so first of all just open your favorite browser and search for MongoDB and hopefully the first link which will appear here will be from MongoDB dotcom which is this one so I'm going to just click on that link and here this website MongoDB website keeps on changing so you just need to search for the Downloads button so at the time of making this video this button is at the topright end of this website which is this one so I'm going to click on this download button and then we need to choose which version of MongoDB we want to download so we want the community server for MongoDB so just choose this option which says community server and then choose the OS X version right now here you have the option to download that tgz file which is the format of you know compression which is similar to the zip file if you are familiar with the zip files right so just click on this download button which is going to download the tgz file you can see this download for the tgz file is started so it's around 87 megabyte files so it will take some time to download so I'm going to just pause this video until this file is downloaded and once it's downloaded we are going to see how to extract it and how to install MongoDB so now this MongoDB tgz file is downloaded on my Mac operating system so what I'm going to do is I'm going to minimize the browser and now I'm going to open that terminal right so just open your terminal and once the terminal is open we are going to just CD to the Downloads folder where we have saved our DG's at friends so let me do LS to list all the content and you can see this file we have downloaded right so first of all we are going to extract this file because it's a zip file so to extract it you just need to give this command tar and then X Z F and then the name of your tar file which is MongoDB OS X SSL whatever version dot TG said right and then press Enter which is going to extract this tar file and once this star file is extracted we are going to just copy the content of this MongoDB folder to our user local folder so now the command is successful and we are going to do LS once again and you can see it has extracted this folder which is mom would be be OS X whatever version is right so this folder we just need to move this folder to the user local folder so the next is to move this folder so we will use the MV command all the command I'm going to give you in the description of this video so you can directly copy those come on and then paste it into your terminal also so MV and let's use sudo for it because we are going to copy it into the user local folder right so MV and then the name of your MongoDB folder and then the destination folder so the destination folder will be user local and then we will name our MongoDB folder as MongoDB so just write DB okay so this is the command to move this folder to the user local bin let me just maximize this terminal so we can see this command in a better way so this is the command to move just press ENTER and then give your max password I'm going to give my max password and now this command is successful let's list all the contents of this downloads folder once again so you can see only tgz file is remaining here we have already moved this folder to the user local MongoDB folder so let's CD to the user local MongoDB folder and let's see if we have this folder there or not so user local and then DB and then LS and you can see all the contents of this DB e a folder is transferred to use a local forward slash MongoDB okay so once this is done the next step is to create the forward

so sudo mkdir p4 slash data for / DB + press enter and then you can just see if this directory is created or not so I'm going to just do CD or slash data and /d B and let's enter and we are inside this four slash data for / DB folder I have given double forward slash here by mistake but you can just just give this for / dat ax for / DV it will work fine also okay so I'm going to just do PWD which is present working directory and you can see we are inside this four slash data for / DB right so now the next step is to manually change the permission of this folder so to change the permission of this folder what we need to do is we you just need to give this command sudo and then we are going to give a CH own command and then whatever is your user name so to know your user name you just need to write Who am I and this is your user name in your case right so to change the permission of for /data /resource urn aim in my case it's code mine but in your case it will be different and then /data /index enter which is going to change the permission of this folder which is for /data /resource /name for now and let me just do CD so that i'm going to be in my home directory right so just to CD blank CD which is going to just redirect you to your home directory right so once you are in your home directory you can just do pwt and you will be in your users forward slash whatever you is your username right so you need to be in this directory and then you just need to open the bash profile file here so you can just do LS l for example to list out all the files and let me do LS
