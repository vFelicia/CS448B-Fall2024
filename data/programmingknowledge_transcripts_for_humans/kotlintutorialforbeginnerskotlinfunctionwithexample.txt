00:00 - till now we have discussed about string
00:02 - string function operator now we will
00:04 - discuss about functions in kotlin so we
00:07 - have already used a function named for a
00:10 - main function
00:11 - okay in each of our each and every code
00:14 - okay
00:15 - this is the main function that we have
00:17 - used so what is a function function is a
00:19 - collection of code that returns some
00:22 - result okay so despite of the main
00:25 - function we are talking about other
00:26 - functions okay
00:28 - so
00:29 - we will firstly discuss about the syntax
00:32 - of the
00:32 - function of any function so
00:35 - the syntax of any function is given by
00:37 - fun
00:38 - that is the keyword for declaring any
00:40 - function then comes the function name
00:42 - the function name should be same as the
00:45 - identifiers uh defined by me
00:48 - at the starting of variables okay so the
00:51 - same thing should be used and
00:53 - uh
00:55 - the function name should be self
00:56 - explanatory so after two or three months
00:59 - when you look at the code you should
01:01 - know that
01:04 - why is the function named like this okay
01:07 - then comes argument one type one comma
01:10 - argument 2 colon type 2 comma and so on
01:14 - ok so what is an argument arguments are
01:17 - the
01:18 - data that a function needs to use so
01:21 - suppose there is a function
01:23 - which
01:24 - takes two input
01:26 - to integer and provides its sums so
01:30 - there is a function which provides the
01:31 - sum of two integers
01:34 - so the function name should be sum of
01:36 - two number okay with s small o capital s
01:40 - um small o capital f small uh n n
01:44 - capital and uh everything small okay so
01:47 - that
01:48 - is the um best way of naming it and then
01:52 - comes the argument so it provides the
01:54 - sum of two integer
01:56 - so the argument one should be a or any
01:58 - name of the
02:00 - argument of the
02:01 - variable and the type is integer so it
02:05 - is a column integer and comma comma b
02:09 - colon integer
02:11 - so that's the argument and then comes
02:13 - the return type so we have to mention
02:14 - the written type written type is nothing
02:17 - but expected
02:20 - data type of the result okay so
02:23 - when i
02:24 - write the code
02:26 - when i write a function to
02:29 - give the result as sum of the two
02:31 - numbers so the return type is also int
02:34 - so here i am here i will mention the
02:36 - written type that is hint
02:39 - okay then comes the lines of code and
02:41 - then uh
02:43 - there is written result
02:45 - okay so here we use the written keyword
02:48 - and
02:50 - give the result what is the result okay
02:52 - so i will go ahead and
02:56 - so every function is every new function
02:59 - is
03:00 - made is coded outside the main function
03:03 - okay so i'll go ahead and
03:06 - make a function
03:09 - i'll name it as
03:11 - new function
03:15 - okay
03:16 - now
03:17 - i want this function to print
03:20 - an statement so what are the argument
03:22 - given to him given to the
03:26 - function so
03:28 - there is no argument given
03:30 - when i have to
03:32 - print the
03:34 - the
03:36 - any lines so i'll just keep it empty so
03:40 - when there is
03:42 - no written type so the
03:44 - the function is just printing
03:46 - it is not returning anything so
03:49 - then the
03:51 - the written type is mentioned as unit
03:54 - okay and then i'll
03:56 - open the
03:57 - function and i'll just write println
04:01 - i am a new
04:04 - function
04:06 - okay so here we have defined a new
04:07 - function which prints i am a new
04:09 - function
04:10 - so
04:11 - the function is defined as per the
04:13 - syntax now what if we have to call the
04:16 - function so as you might know the
04:19 - main function is only executed
04:21 - so we have to call the function to the
04:23 - main function so what i'll do is i'll
04:25 - just name the function here which is new
04:27 - function
04:28 - and just keep it empty if there were any
04:31 - arguments so i'll mention the arguments
04:33 - here
04:34 - okay so i'll go ahead and
04:37 - just run
04:38 - the
04:39 - function
04:41 - the code r code
04:44 - so
04:49 - as you can see in the output screen we
04:52 - have successfully printed a function
04:54 - which says i am a new function okay so
04:57 - we have now a function
04:59 - we are now capable of uh
05:01 - making a function which prints
05:03 - something okay so as no arguments are
05:06 - used so no data is used by the function
05:09 - okay so it is kept blank
05:12 - okay so no written type
05:14 - is there but therefore the unit is used
05:17 - so when i hover over unit so it says
05:19 - that the type with only one value the
05:22 - unit object okay this correspond to
05:24 - white type in java okay
05:26 - so the written statement is never used
05:29 - because we are not returning anything in
05:31 - this function you might notice that we
05:33 - have not used any written the written
05:36 - keyword is not used
05:38 - okay so what is a unit unit is used when
05:41 - a fun
05:42 - does not rhythm return any meaningful
05:44 - result
05:45 - so it is it it we might call it as the
05:48 - default data type of in any function
05:51 - okay so
05:52 - till now we have discussed what is a
05:54 - function what is the syntax of function
05:57 - okay so this is a block body of the
06:00 - syntax okay there is also expression
06:02 - body which we will discuss later
06:04 - so we have discussed the syntax we have
06:07 - made a function that prints that i am a
06:09 - new function
06:10 - and that's all for the video we will
06:13 - continue with functions in later videos
06:15 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

till now we have discussed about string string function operator now we will discuss about functions in kotlin so we have already used a function named for a main function okay in each of our each and every code okay this is the main function that we have used so what is a function function is a collection of code that returns some result okay so despite of the main function we are talking about other functions okay so we will firstly discuss about the syntax of the function of any function so the syntax of any function is given by fun that is the keyword for declaring any function then comes the function name the function name should be same as the identifiers uh defined by me at the starting of variables okay so the same thing should be used and uh the function name should be self explanatory so after two or three months when you look at the code you should know that why is the function named like this okay then comes argument one type one comma argument 2 colon type 2 comma and so on ok so what is an argument arguments are the data that a function needs to use so suppose there is a function which takes two input to integer and provides its sums so there is a function which provides the sum of two integers so the function name should be sum of two number okay with s small o capital s um small o capital f small uh n n capital and uh everything small okay so that is the um best way of naming it and then comes the argument so it provides the sum of two integer so the argument one should be a or any name of the argument of the variable and the type is integer so it is a column integer and comma comma b colon integer so that's the argument and then comes the return type so we have to mention the written type written type is nothing but expected data type of the result okay so when i write the code when i write a function to give the result as sum of the two numbers so the return type is also int so here i am here i will mention the written type that is hint okay then comes the lines of code and then uh there is written result okay so here we use the written keyword and give the result what is the result okay so i will go ahead and so every function is every new function is made is coded outside the main function okay so i'll go ahead and make a function i'll name it as new function okay now i want this function to print an statement so what are the argument given to him given to the function so there is no argument given when i have to print the the any lines so i'll just keep it empty so when there is no written type so the the function is just printing it is not returning anything so then the the written type is mentioned as unit okay and then i'll open the function and i'll just write println i am a new function okay so here we have defined a new function which prints i am a new function so the function is defined as per the syntax now what if we have to call the function so as you might know the main function is only executed so we have to call the function to the main function so what i'll do is i'll just name the function here which is new function and just keep it empty if there were any arguments so i'll mention the arguments here okay so i'll go ahead and just run the function the code r code so as you can see in the output screen we have successfully printed a function which says i am a new function okay so we have now a function we are now capable of uh making a function which prints something okay so as no arguments are used so no data is used by the function okay so it is kept blank okay so no written type is there but therefore the unit is used so when i hover over unit so it says that the type with only one value the unit object okay this correspond to white type in java okay so the written statement is never used because we are not returning anything in this function you might notice that we have not used any written the written keyword is not used okay so what is a unit unit is used when a fun does not rhythm return any meaningful result so it is it it we might call it as the default data type of in any function okay so till now we have discussed what is a function what is the syntax of function okay so this is a block body of the syntax okay there is also expression body which we will discuss later so we have discussed the syntax we have made a function that prints that i am a new function and that's all for the video we will continue with functions in later videos thank you
