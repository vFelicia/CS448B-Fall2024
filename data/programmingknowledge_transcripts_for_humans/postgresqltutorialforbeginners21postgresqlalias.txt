00:11 - want to show to the output on the screen
00:14 - the actual name will not change it will
00:18 - change only the result in which column
00:22 - name is displayed okay so first of all
00:27 - let us understand this in text okay so
00:43 - select then the column name
00:57 - as so select column names the original
01:24 - column name as the new column that we
01:28 - want to display on the output from the
01:31 - table and if you want to give alias name
01:38 - to multiple column that can also be done
01:41 - in post press well you just need to
01:44 - write select column name one new column
02:00 - name in coma for security
02:11 - column name to a new colony and you can
02:26 - spend multiple condoms at the end of it
02:33 - okay so this is how you can specify
02:40 - multiple columns for alias okay okay so
02:44 - open your terminal type psql let us say
02:57 - which our database is present in our
02:59 - system for that friedrich /l here as you
03:05 - can see we have testicles
03:08 - so for connecting that test database
03:12 - write business c for connecting and name
03:15 - of the database now we are connected to
03:19 - test database let us see which are the
03:22 - tables present in our taste database so
03:26 - we have two Devils here employee table
03:28 - and student table as you can see so let
03:34 - us see the structure of student table
03:36 - for that right Bixler's be a name of the
03:40 - table so student table contains two
03:45 - columns first one is roll number let us
03:52 - connect some data okay so here you can
04:03 - see it come up with the original column
04:07 - number or number any now I want to
04:11 - display row number as ID I don't want to
04:16 - change the original column name but I
04:19 - want that whenever I
04:21 - is really the people who are going to
04:24 - see this result will get ideal comes
04:28 - here okay so we right say you don't want
04:41 - to change the name from name of the
04:45 - table okay again select the original
04:52 - column name in this case it will be row
04:55 - number is ID name because I want to
05:04 - display name also from detail okay as
05:09 - you can see the result will be the same
05:12 - except the column name roll number is
05:16 - replaced by this ID if I can write star
05:23 - here instead of Swiss by column C since
05:36 - the original name is not changed okay so
05:49 - database taste very good okay so this
05:55 - time we are going to use employee table
