With timestamps:

00:00 - so basically we have already covered
00:02 - that how we can add users into another
00:04 - group so now we will also like do some
00:07 - other operations like for this we will I
00:09 - will I'll just create another user
00:12 - uh I will use the command add usage
00:14 - using sudo
00:15 - and I will give it the name as a file
00:17 - name let's create uh create with the
00:19 - hackerman
00:20 - oh sorry
00:22 - a new password
00:25 - I command
00:27 - hi command I think yeah I have written
00:30 - correct I will not provide any kind of
00:33 - extra information just yes okay done so
00:37 - to check whether the user has been great
00:38 - or not what we do we check the
00:42 - this file that is hackerman has been
00:44 - created here you can see the with
00:46 - uid1008 and gid1008 okay
00:51 - so uh for login so how you can do it you
00:54 - can just switch
00:57 - user SEO hackerman and the password
01:01 - I command so here you can see we are in
01:04 - this the hackerman directory okay
01:06 - so when you do LS so nothing you don't
01:09 - have permission
01:10 - at least okay here you can see all those
01:13 - kind of things
01:14 - log out
01:17 - I will just exit Okay exit we use it for
01:21 - uh
01:22 - like close that particular session of
01:24 - that particular user
01:26 - so now what we can do
01:28 - we will just try to change the username
01:31 - of that not username I will add first
01:35 - some kind of comments in that particular
01:37 - user so how you can do it
01:39 - user mode hyphen C
01:45 - so here I will use a hyphen C option
01:47 - okay to provide some comments so let me
01:50 - provide like uh I am a hacker
01:53 - okay and the name of that the particular
01:56 - user High command and I will use sudo
01:58 - like because we can't use normally this
02:01 - command
02:02 - okay so now let's check the sorry not I
02:06 - don't want to switch I need this one
02:08 - yeah so here you can see the comment has
02:11 - been added like I am a hacker so in this
02:14 - way uh if you want to like
02:16 - add some kind of comments like in our
02:18 - previous video you can see like uh there
02:21 - is a developer section and if you want
02:22 - to add some comment to that particular
02:24 - user then you can add like this is first
02:27 - developer this is second developer or
02:28 - his ID is this his ID this okay and kind
02:31 - of this kind of things you can do
02:33 - okay so now moving forward what we can
02:36 - do uh we can also change the uid what is
02:38 - uid uid is just the unique identifier
02:40 - number which you can change of any
02:42 - particular user which you want
02:44 - so how you can do it simple
02:47 - just provide uh
02:50 - hyphen which option U option and then
02:53 - uid which you want so right now what it
02:55 - is one double zero eight I will
02:58 - give it as two double zero it let's hit
03:00 - enter and again uh let's check this
03:02 - content of that particular file and it
03:04 - should be change yeah so here you can
03:07 - see 2008 this is the uid and what is
03:10 - this one double zero this is the GID
03:12 - okay but we have what changed we have
03:13 - changed the
03:15 - uid okay so uh we have covered now
03:18 - iPhone c hyphen U now moving forward and
03:21 - uh if you want to change the username of
03:24 - this particular hackerman like from a
03:26 - hackerman to if you want to change it
03:29 - like um
03:31 - best hacker like this like this kind of
03:33 - thing if you want to
03:35 - so how you can do it uh I will use again
03:38 - the C sudo user mod okay and I will use
03:42 - hyphen L option for changing the
03:45 - username
03:46 - hyphen L and the new username which you
03:49 - want I want sorry
03:54 - uh I want uh best hacker
03:58 - okay
04:00 - I will hit enter and again
04:04 - check here
04:06 - so here you can see the name from
04:08 - hackerman to best hacker like it has
04:11 - been
04:12 - changed so in this way you can also
04:13 - change the like username of your uh okay
04:19 - you can change the username of your
04:21 - particular user if you want okay and
04:23 - also you the most like important thing
04:25 - is here you can use hyphen e option also
04:27 - okay
04:28 - uh hypheny option what it will provide
04:31 - it will just add the like expired date
04:33 - like when that user should be get
04:35 - disabled
04:36 - so you can do it using the just one
04:39 - option that is a user mode hyphen e es
04:42 - transfer expiry and the particular date
04:45 - on which you want okay
04:48 - so today is uh 28 I will provide it as a
04:52 - 30 okay 30
04:55 - no not in this I think year month and
04:58 - then 2022
05:00 - and then month that is
05:03 - eight
05:05 - and 30 okay
05:08 - I will hit enter and the hackerman
05:10 - doesn't exist yeah because we have
05:12 - changed the name from hackerman to which
05:14 - best hacker
05:16 - best hacker
05:19 - done let's check whether it is
05:21 - reflecting or not it should
05:24 - okay but here it is not reflecting it
05:26 - reflects and writing Shadow file okay
05:30 - so uh in this way you can also add the
05:32 - expiry date and one more like important
05:35 - command is that locking and unlocking of
05:38 - user account now you can do it in this
05:39 - so for this option we use the capital L
05:42 - option okay to lock a user so in this
05:45 - what happens like uh the that user can't
05:48 - log in using the username and password
05:50 - like but other methods are required like
05:52 - key based or switching user like which
05:54 - we did here earlier okay
05:57 - so to log the user what we can do user
06:00 - mode iPhone l
06:02 - uh capital and the best hacker
06:05 - permission denied why we have not used
06:08 - sudo hit enter we have logged the user
06:11 - if I will try to not right now first of
06:14 - all I have to delete some users
06:17 - like I'm Linux marketing these all the
06:20 - users I want to delete uh how you can do
06:22 - it sudo user Dell
06:25 - uh I am Linux
06:29 - marketing
06:30 - [Music]
06:32 - maybe a simultaneously if I um I don't
06:35 - know I can do or not
06:37 - mt1
06:41 - tester two
06:44 - tester one
06:47 - develop one
06:51 - developer 2.
06:57 - okay but I don't think I'm
07:02 - succeed or not I don't think
07:06 - okay
07:07 - so now I am not like able to like delete
07:11 - that users like simultaneously okay so I
07:14 - will need to do one by one let me do it
07:17 - first because I have to show you like I
07:20 - am not able to login using the username
07:22 - and password okay
07:24 - so the user Dell developer one
07:28 - again develop it
07:31 - developer 2
07:34 - again tester one
07:41 - star two
07:43 - marketing
07:46 - what is the name of the user that mt1
07:51 - done again it is marketing something
07:54 - marketing to done I am Linux
07:58 - I am Linux done okay so we have deleted
08:02 - all the users like XI users which we had
08:05 - created earlier
08:06 - okay
08:09 - so now let me check the again that file
08:12 - okay so here you can see on the best
08:13 - hacker is there so now what I will do I
08:15 - will try to like uh
08:19 - switch user from here
08:22 - okay
08:25 - uh
08:28 - wait a minute it's like
08:31 - yeah
08:32 - not listed it's not showing yeah and it
08:35 - is not showing okay
08:37 - so when we will unlock then we will try
08:40 - to check whether it is uh like visible
08:43 - or not that option of particular that
08:45 - user okay so I think if we have logged
08:48 - it that's why it's not visible to us
08:51 - okay
08:52 - so uh now to unlock the particular user
08:55 - what you can do you can you have to just
08:57 - use hyphen you option okay but before
08:59 - that I will show you this one like if
09:03 - you are able to switch or not
09:09 - uh
09:11 - I don't think we are
09:18 - authentication failure okay
09:26 - okay authentication failure will be
09:28 - there yeah I'm correct so now what if we
09:31 - have blocked the user now what we can do
09:33 - we will provide this hyphenue option it
09:35 - will unlock the user okay so again let's
09:38 - check whether we are able to log in or
09:41 - not so now now we are able to login so
09:44 - when you log the user you can't just
09:47 - um login or anything for live using
09:50 - username and password okay so here also
09:52 - if we try to check whether the name of
09:55 - that particular user is available or not
09:58 - switch user
10:03 - just wait for a minute like it takes
10:05 - some time
10:07 - so here you can see I am a hacker white
