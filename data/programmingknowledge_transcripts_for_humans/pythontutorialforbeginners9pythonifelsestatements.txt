00:00 - hello guys welcome once again till now I
00:02 - have been showing you uh basic but very
00:05 - important concepts of python now from
00:09 - this video we are going to uh write some
00:12 - code in our python file and from this
00:16 - video we are going to write some useful
00:19 - code and uh this video I will start from
00:23 - uh showing you how conditional statement
00:27 - works and in this video I'm going to
00:30 - specifically take if statement in
00:33 - Python so let's get started I have this
00:37 - um test. python file which I made uh if
00:42 - you don't know how to make this test.
00:44 - python file you just need to go to file
00:46 - in the shell and just click new file and
00:51 - then just save your file at your
00:54 - specified location by uh some name okay
00:59 - and you will will be
01:00 - having this type of uh file so my python
01:04 - file name is test
01:07 - test.py
01:09 - now the conditional statement which uh
01:14 - I'm going to take uh let's see how if
01:16 - statement works so for example I want to
01:20 - find out
01:22 - the absolute value of a number how can I
01:27 - find out by using a if statement
01:30 - so for example I write uh variable which
01:34 - takes an input so I ask the user to
01:38 - enter an input and I convert it to an
01:41 - integer and will be saved in the
01:44 - variable called n okay now I want to
01:47 - find out the absolute value of that
01:50 - number so what I can do is I can use if
01:53 - statement and how you can uh declare if
01:56 - statement just write if and then
02:00 - the condition okay so here comes
02:06 - the condition this is a pseudo code I'm
02:09 - writing so we are going to replace this
02:12 - condition by a real condition and then
02:15 - in here so always remember when you
02:18 - write code in Python it's uh indentation
02:23 - is really necessary so if you uh write
02:27 - any condition for example if if you give
02:32 - another code for example uh I want to
02:35 - print
02:36 - something what it will do
02:38 - is this statement uh sees the
02:43 - indentation and let me give you an
02:45 - example first and then I will illustrate
02:49 - the basic concept of indentation so I
02:53 - want to find out the absolute number
02:55 - right so in the condition I can write n
02:59 - if n is less than zero so this is a
03:04 - condition I'm checking if uh user enters
03:07 - the value n Which is less than zero what
03:12 - I'm going to do is I'm going to
03:15 - print
03:17 - print uh the value absolute value so I'm
03:21 - going to just
03:23 - write uh
03:28 - the
03:30 - absolute
03:33 - value
03:35 - of and then the I can just uh use comma
03:40 - to give the value of N and once again I
03:43 - can use comma to you know separate this
03:46 - string and I can write
03:49 - is
03:51 - is and let me make a little bit
03:56 - bigger is and then I can just separate
03:59 - it by one other comma and I can just
04:01 - write minus n if if the value is less
04:06 - than zero right so let's uh save this
04:09 - program just controll s to save the
04:13 - program and I will run the program run
04:15 - module or
04:16 - F5 and it says invalid
04:20 - syntax and why it says invalid syntax
04:24 - here is because in here after if
04:28 - condition you need to give colon here
04:31 - okay so this is taken as a condition and
04:36 - after colon it uh it indicates that this
04:40 - condition ends here and then the
04:41 - statement start from here once again
04:44 - save it and run
04:46 - it and then it will run in this shell
04:50 - and it's
04:51 - asking uh the user to enter a number I
04:54 - will enter a negative number minus 3 and
04:57 - press enter and it gives gives
05:00 - me uh the absolute value of minus 3
05:03 - which is three okay now for
05:08 - example I want I I I enter a positive
05:11 - number what happens then okay so I will
05:14 - run it once again and this time I enter
05:17 - plus 10 and now nothing happens because
05:22 - this condition we are checking is less
05:25 - than or we are checking for the number
05:28 - less than zero so this will print this
05:31 - and just remember always that always
05:34 - provide an indentation here okay if you
05:38 - don't provide this uh small space or tab
05:42 - here and just you know write your code
05:45 - here with no space here and save your
05:49 - program and run it let's see what
05:53 - happens so it says expected and indented
05:57 - block right so always provide an
06:00 - indentation and it it's you know show
06:03 - you the place where the error is coming
06:05 - in red you know red highlight okay so
06:10 - always provide just give a tab uh
06:14 - before your statement after if condition
06:18 - okay or after
06:20 - any any uh logic which you
06:24 - right so now this is considered as a
06:27 - statement okay and if if you uh if you
06:31 - write this if statement like this it
06:34 - will consider this line as a different
06:37 - code and it will not come as a statement
06:40 - of if condition okay now for example I
06:43 - provide the positive number and I also
06:46 - want to give the absolute value of this
06:49 - positive number so what I can do is I
06:53 - can just give else condition else so
06:58 - your state statements start from you
07:01 - know with no space here but so if your
07:06 - condition is if and then we have the uh
07:10 - else condition so your condition start
07:13 - from no space but the statement inside
07:16 - your condition starts with the
07:18 - indentation or space here just give a
07:21 - tab and it will give you this uh
07:24 - space okay so once again I want to print
07:28 - out the absolute value
07:29 - of a number now I want to check whether
07:32 - number is positive so if the number is
07:35 - not negative which is this condition if
07:38 - number is less than zero which mean
07:41 - number is negative this will be printed
07:44 - else if the number is positive because
07:48 - this condition is not true that means
07:49 - definitely the number is positive I want
07:52 - to uh print out the absolute value of
07:55 - this positive number right so I will
07:58 - just print it like this absolute value
08:00 - of this should be
08:02 - value n is positive because the absolute
08:07 - value of positive number is positive
08:10 - right so now when I save the program and
08:15 - run
08:17 - it and it says invalid syntax once again
08:20 - why because I also need to give this
08:24 - colon here right now once again save it
08:28 - and run your
08:30 - program and it gives me uh this question
08:34 - mark with a number I give 10 once again
08:38 - and it says absolute value of 10 is 10
08:42 - so this is the basic syntax of if
08:45 - statement your um you give if as a
08:50 - keyword for checking the comparison or
08:53 - uh comparison and you compare some
08:57 - values so right now we are comparing ing
08:59 - our value which user enters from zero
09:03 - and if it's less than zero we print this
09:06 - else anything else uh will be covered by
09:10 - this statement and always uh remember
09:13 - that your um uh if statement or lse
09:17 - statement with will uh have no space
09:20 - here but your actual you know uh code
09:24 - which you write in if statement or else
09:26 - statement will be uh will have have to
09:29 - have this kind of indentation here
09:32 - indentation means space or tab
09:35 - okay and it's not necessary that you can
09:39 - only give one line of code inside your
09:41 - if condition you can just give multiple
09:45 - lines of code inside your if condition
09:49 - uh I will
09:52 - just make it little bit prettier so it
09:56 - can have you know multiple line of
10:00 - statement your if if condition or your
10:03 - else condition this is just an example
10:06 - I'm giving but this will be some logical
10:08 - code which you have to write here and in
10:11 - a similar way you
10:13 - can just uh give this here right here
10:18 - right so you can have multiple statement
10:21 - in else
10:23 - condition now one more thing to uh
10:27 - remember here is is whenever you want to
10:31 - go outside so now want you want to do
10:34 - some other operation for example I want
10:38 - to do uh I want to add two numbers
10:42 - n or uh some I will declare a variable
10:47 - called
10:48 - sum uh sum of two for example this is my
10:53 - variable name and I add 50 plus 60 okay
11:00 - and I want to print
11:04 - it print and then I want uh just print
11:09 - this sum of these two numbers right so
11:14 - if I do it like this for example I do it
11:17 - like this what will happen let's see I
11:21 - save it and run my
11:24 - program and I give
11:27 - uh negative number minus 9 for example
11:33 - and it gives me uh these values which is
11:37 - which it execute these values okay but I
11:41 - wanted to print uh uh this number also
11:45 - after the U my FS condition so how I can
11:50 - uh you know show or I how I can tell
11:53 - python that my else condition is now
11:57 - closed or my
11:59 - this IFL condition is now over and I
12:02 - want to print this now so your next code
12:07 - should start from once again with no
12:10 - space okay
12:13 - so this is this will be considered as a
12:17 - different code and it will not be
12:19 - included in these condition uh
12:22 - conditional statements right and now
12:25 - when I save it I will save it
12:29 - and then I give minus 8 for example yeah
12:33 - I need to give minus
12:35 - 8 and now you see it gives me the
12:39 - absolute value which execute this code
12:41 - and then it execute my another code this
12:44 - code which I want to execute after my if
12:47 - condition okay so just if you want to
12:51 - end your L statement and you uh you know
12:55 - want to write some other code just start
12:57 - from no space so indentation is really
13:01 - very important in Python if you uh you
13:05 - know write or give this indentation
13:08 - incorrectly your python code will give
13:10 - any error or some error okay so this is
13:14 - the if else condition in Python in
13:19 - future I'm going to show you some more
13:21 - interesting stuff in Python so stay
13:23 - tuned and please writ comment and
13:24 - subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again till now I have been showing you uh basic but very important concepts of python now from this video we are going to uh write some code in our python file and from this video we are going to write some useful code and uh this video I will start from uh showing you how conditional statement works and in this video I'm going to specifically take if statement in Python so let's get started I have this um test. python file which I made uh if you don't know how to make this test. python file you just need to go to file in the shell and just click new file and then just save your file at your specified location by uh some name okay and you will will be having this type of uh file so my python file name is test test.py now the conditional statement which uh I'm going to take uh let's see how if statement works so for example I want to find out the absolute value of a number how can I find out by using a if statement so for example I write uh variable which takes an input so I ask the user to enter an input and I convert it to an integer and will be saved in the variable called n okay now I want to find out the absolute value of that number so what I can do is I can use if statement and how you can uh declare if statement just write if and then the condition okay so here comes the condition this is a pseudo code I'm writing so we are going to replace this condition by a real condition and then in here so always remember when you write code in Python it's uh indentation is really necessary so if you uh write any condition for example if if you give another code for example uh I want to print something what it will do is this statement uh sees the indentation and let me give you an example first and then I will illustrate the basic concept of indentation so I want to find out the absolute number right so in the condition I can write n if n is less than zero so this is a condition I'm checking if uh user enters the value n Which is less than zero what I'm going to do is I'm going to print print uh the value absolute value so I'm going to just write uh the absolute value of and then the I can just uh use comma to give the value of N and once again I can use comma to you know separate this string and I can write is is and let me make a little bit bigger is and then I can just separate it by one other comma and I can just write minus n if if the value is less than zero right so let's uh save this program just controll s to save the program and I will run the program run module or F5 and it says invalid syntax and why it says invalid syntax here is because in here after if condition you need to give colon here okay so this is taken as a condition and after colon it uh it indicates that this condition ends here and then the statement start from here once again save it and run it and then it will run in this shell and it's asking uh the user to enter a number I will enter a negative number minus 3 and press enter and it gives gives me uh the absolute value of minus 3 which is three okay now for example I want I I I enter a positive number what happens then okay so I will run it once again and this time I enter plus 10 and now nothing happens because this condition we are checking is less than or we are checking for the number less than zero so this will print this and just remember always that always provide an indentation here okay if you don't provide this uh small space or tab here and just you know write your code here with no space here and save your program and run it let's see what happens so it says expected and indented block right so always provide an indentation and it it's you know show you the place where the error is coming in red you know red highlight okay so always provide just give a tab uh before your statement after if condition okay or after any any uh logic which you right so now this is considered as a statement okay and if if you uh if you write this if statement like this it will consider this line as a different code and it will not come as a statement of if condition okay now for example I provide the positive number and I also want to give the absolute value of this positive number so what I can do is I can just give else condition else so your state statements start from you know with no space here but so if your condition is if and then we have the uh else condition so your condition start from no space but the statement inside your condition starts with the indentation or space here just give a tab and it will give you this uh space okay so once again I want to print out the absolute value of a number now I want to check whether number is positive so if the number is not negative which is this condition if number is less than zero which mean number is negative this will be printed else if the number is positive because this condition is not true that means definitely the number is positive I want to uh print out the absolute value of this positive number right so I will just print it like this absolute value of this should be value n is positive because the absolute value of positive number is positive right so now when I save the program and run it and it says invalid syntax once again why because I also need to give this colon here right now once again save it and run your program and it gives me uh this question mark with a number I give 10 once again and it says absolute value of 10 is 10 so this is the basic syntax of if statement your um you give if as a keyword for checking the comparison or uh comparison and you compare some values so right now we are comparing ing our value which user enters from zero and if it's less than zero we print this else anything else uh will be covered by this statement and always uh remember that your um uh if statement or lse statement with will uh have no space here but your actual you know uh code which you write in if statement or else statement will be uh will have have to have this kind of indentation here indentation means space or tab okay and it's not necessary that you can only give one line of code inside your if condition you can just give multiple lines of code inside your if condition uh I will just make it little bit prettier so it can have you know multiple line of statement your if if condition or your else condition this is just an example I'm giving but this will be some logical code which you have to write here and in a similar way you can just uh give this here right here right so you can have multiple statement in else condition now one more thing to uh remember here is is whenever you want to go outside so now want you want to do some other operation for example I want to do uh I want to add two numbers n or uh some I will declare a variable called sum uh sum of two for example this is my variable name and I add 50 plus 60 okay and I want to print it print and then I want uh just print this sum of these two numbers right so if I do it like this for example I do it like this what will happen let's see I save it and run my program and I give uh negative number minus 9 for example and it gives me uh these values which is which it execute these values okay but I wanted to print uh uh this number also after the U my FS condition so how I can uh you know show or I how I can tell python that my else condition is now closed or my this IFL condition is now over and I want to print this now so your next code should start from once again with no space okay so this is this will be considered as a different code and it will not be included in these condition uh conditional statements right and now when I save it I will save it and then I give minus 8 for example yeah I need to give minus 8 and now you see it gives me the absolute value which execute this code and then it execute my another code this code which I want to execute after my if condition okay so just if you want to end your L statement and you uh you know want to write some other code just start from no space so indentation is really very important in Python if you uh you know write or give this indentation incorrectly your python code will give any error or some error okay so this is the if else condition in Python in future I'm going to show you some more interesting stuff in Python so stay tuned and please writ comment and subscribe and bye for now
