00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can use menu
00:08 - bar in Java effects so let's get started
00:12 - I have created this sample project and I
00:15 - have named it as menu bar and inside
00:19 - this application package I have this
00:22 - main dot Java where I have changed this
00:25 - default line of code which adds a main
00:29 - dot app XML file and I have also created
00:32 - this main dot F XML file which is right
00:34 - now empty and I have created this main
00:38 - controller dot Java class which is also
00:40 - empty right now okay so first of all
00:44 - what we are going to do is we are going
00:47 - to open our main dot F XML file in scene
00:51 - builder now once your F XML file is open
00:54 - in scene builder you can just select
00:56 - your anchor pin and delete it and this
01:01 - time we are going to use border pin so
01:04 - go to containers here and then search
01:07 - for border pin and drag and drop here
01:11 - now the border pin has some sections you
01:15 - can see it has top left center right and
01:20 - bottom right now in order to add a menu
01:25 - bar in this border pin what you can do
01:29 - is you can go to controls there is a
01:31 - section called menu also but you will
01:34 - not find menu bar here but you will find
01:37 - menu bar in the controls right so search
01:40 - for menu bar in the controls and then
01:44 - drag and drop on the top section of your
01:48 - border pin okay so it will stick to the
01:52 - top and let's preview this how it looks
01:55 - like you can see by default it has three
01:59 - menu items and then you have this closed
02:03 - sub item also right and now to add some
02:08 - more menu items first of all let's see
02:11 - inside this menu
02:13 - so you can just go here select your menu
02:16 - bar and expand it and you can see three
02:20 - menus are here one is file which is this
02:24 - one other is added which is this one and
02:27 - third one is health which is this one
02:29 - now when you expand more you can see
02:33 - menu items
02:34 - okay so first menu has one menu item
02:38 - which is closed second menu has one menu
02:42 - item which is delete and third menu also
02:45 - has one menu item which is about okay
02:48 - now in order to add more menu items
02:52 - inside your menu what you can do is you
02:56 - can go to menus category here and take a
03:00 - menu item and then drag and drop inside
03:04 - your menu so for example I want to have
03:07 - this menu item inside the file menu I
03:11 - can drag and drop and wherever you want
03:14 - to insert it just leave it there okay
03:17 - and here you can see there is a box here
03:22 - here you can give the name to your menu
03:25 - item right so for example I want to for
03:29 - example I want to make some menu
03:32 - something like this so I will add this
03:35 - open you know name here okay as a menu
03:39 - item so I will just write open okay and
03:43 - I am going to add one more menu item
03:46 - inside the file and I will drag and drop
03:50 - here and let's see what can we do save
03:53 - for example okay
03:55 - so save okay and press Enter and let's
04:00 - preview as it once again and now we have
04:03 - three menu items inside the file menu
04:07 - okay now you can also have menus inside
04:13 - the menu so for example I click this
04:17 - file here you can see this new from
04:21 - template and this is one more menu
04:25 - inside a menu because it has
04:27 - its own menu items like this right so
04:30 - what we can do here is we can just take
04:34 - a menu from the menu category and drag
04:36 - and drop inside the file menu for
04:39 - example here and now this menu has its
04:45 - own menu items right so you can rename
04:50 - this menu like this for example let's
04:54 - say what we can do for example it's our
04:57 - import menu so I will just name it as
05:01 - import right and then it also has its
05:06 - own menu items you can see by default it
05:10 - has one menu item and for example import
05:15 - has F XML and media so we can add as an
05:19 - menu item F XML and let's add one more
05:25 - menu item in the import menu and it will
05:31 - be our second item which was media okay
05:37 - and then save your code and preview it
05:40 - once again and now you can see you have
05:43 - this menu and under the menu you have
05:45 - more sub menus okay now our menu also
05:50 - has this separator line to separate the
05:53 - menu you see there is a little line
05:56 - separating the different menu okay
06:00 - so let's add this separator menu line so
06:04 - just go to the menu and just pick this
06:07 - separator menu item and drag and drop to
06:11 - the menu item in which you want to
06:14 - provide the separator for example I want
06:17 - to provide the separator between closed
06:19 - and open I will just drag and drop this
06:22 - between closed and open and then I can
06:26 - preview it now and when I see it you can
06:29 - see this separator line between closed
06:32 - and open okay so this is called a
06:35 - separator now for example I want to give
06:39 - some
06:40 - to the you know these items right so I
06:44 - will once again preview and for example
06:47 - I have this close menu item and I want
06:51 - to give this action to this menu item
06:56 - that whenever this close is selected
06:59 - then I want to close the application for
07:03 - example okay so in here I will go and
07:06 - select my menu item which is close and I
07:11 - will go to the code here and in here I
07:15 - can give an action okay so I will just
07:20 - say it will call a closed app function
07:25 - okay and then just save everything and
07:30 - then go to your app and refresh your
07:34 - project once again and here also save
07:37 - everything and go to the controller now
07:40 - here and first of all we will implement
07:43 - the initialize Zabel class so just
07:46 - implement initialize able and then add
07:51 - this unimplemented methods and then in
07:55 - here what we are going to do is we are
07:57 - going to create this function which is a
08:00 - public void and the button action right
08:04 - so just write public void and take the
08:08 - same name as you have provided here for
08:10 - the closed on action event right and
08:13 - then give the argument action event and
08:18 - then name the argument name and then
08:24 - inside your method what you can do is
08:27 - you can call these two lines of code one
08:31 - is plateform dot exit and second is
08:34 - system dot exit and which takes an
08:38 - argument 0 now just add this import
08:41 - which is JavaFX application platform and
08:45 - then error will go and this code what it
08:49 - does is it exits from your platform
08:53 - which is
08:54 - affects and this helps you to close your
08:56 - app okay now one last step which is
09:00 - remaining is we want to you know connect
09:03 - the controller class to this effects ml
09:06 - file so just open the SAP XML file go to
09:09 - the controller category here and choose
09:12 - application dot main controller okay and
09:15 - now save everything once again and
09:17 - refresh your project once again and here
09:21 - also save everything and run your
09:23 - project and now you can see our project
09:28 - is running and it has this menu items
09:30 - and when I click close my app is closed
09:35 - right so once again I run my application
09:38 - and when I click close my app is closed
09:43 - which is due to these two lines of code
09:45 - so in a similar way you can add action
09:49 - events to other menu items also okay so
09:55 - in this way you can use menu bars menu
09:58 - and menu items in JavaFX I hope you

hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use menu bar in Java effects so let's get started I have created this sample project and I have named it as menu bar and inside this application package I have this main dot Java where I have changed this default line of code which adds a main dot app XML file and I have also created this main dot F XML file which is right now empty and I have created this main controller dot Java class which is also empty right now okay so first of all what we are going to do is we are going to open our main dot F XML file in scene builder now once your F XML file is open in scene builder you can just select your anchor pin and delete it and this time we are going to use border pin so go to containers here and then search for border pin and drag and drop here now the border pin has some sections you can see it has top left center right and bottom right now in order to add a menu bar in this border pin what you can do is you can go to controls there is a section called menu also but you will not find menu bar here but you will find menu bar in the controls right so search for menu bar in the controls and then drag and drop on the top section of your border pin okay so it will stick to the top and let's preview this how it looks like you can see by default it has three menu items and then you have this closed sub item also right and now to add some more menu items first of all let's see inside this menu so you can just go here select your menu bar and expand it and you can see three menus are here one is file which is this one other is added which is this one and third one is health which is this one now when you expand more you can see menu items okay so first menu has one menu item which is closed second menu has one menu item which is delete and third menu also has one menu item which is about okay now in order to add more menu items inside your menu what you can do is you can go to menus category here and take a menu item and then drag and drop inside your menu so for example I want to have this menu item inside the file menu I can drag and drop and wherever you want to insert it just leave it there okay and here you can see there is a box here here you can give the name to your menu item right so for example I want to for example I want to make some menu something like this so I will add this open you know name here okay as a menu item so I will just write open okay and I am going to add one more menu item inside the file and I will drag and drop here and let's see what can we do save for example okay so save okay and press Enter and let's preview as it once again and now we have three menu items inside the file menu okay now you can also have menus inside the menu so for example I click this file here you can see this new from template and this is one more menu inside a menu because it has its own menu items like this right so what we can do here is we can just take a menu from the menu category and drag and drop inside the file menu for example here and now this menu has its own menu items right so you can rename this menu like this for example let's say what we can do for example it's our import menu so I will just name it as import right and then it also has its own menu items you can see by default it has one menu item and for example import has F XML and media so we can add as an menu item F XML and let's add one more menu item in the import menu and it will be our second item which was media okay and then save your code and preview it once again and now you can see you have this menu and under the menu you have more sub menus okay now our menu also has this separator line to separate the menu you see there is a little line separating the different menu okay so let's add this separator menu line so just go to the menu and just pick this separator menu item and drag and drop to the menu item in which you want to provide the separator for example I want to provide the separator between closed and open I will just drag and drop this between closed and open and then I can preview it now and when I see it you can see this separator line between closed and open okay so this is called a separator now for example I want to give some to the you know these items right so I will once again preview and for example I have this close menu item and I want to give this action to this menu item that whenever this close is selected then I want to close the application for example okay so in here I will go and select my menu item which is close and I will go to the code here and in here I can give an action okay so I will just say it will call a closed app function okay and then just save everything and then go to your app and refresh your project once again and here also save everything and go to the controller now here and first of all we will implement the initialize Zabel class so just implement initialize able and then add this unimplemented methods and then in here what we are going to do is we are going to create this function which is a public void and the button action right so just write public void and take the same name as you have provided here for the closed on action event right and then give the argument action event and then name the argument name and then inside your method what you can do is you can call these two lines of code one is plateform dot exit and second is system dot exit and which takes an argument 0 now just add this import which is JavaFX application platform and then error will go and this code what it does is it exits from your platform which is affects and this helps you to close your app okay now one last step which is remaining is we want to you know connect the controller class to this effects ml file so just open the SAP XML file go to the controller category here and choose application dot main controller okay and now save everything once again and refresh your project once again and here also save everything and run your project and now you can see our project is running and it has this menu items and when I click close my app is closed right so once again I run my application and when I click close my app is closed which is due to these two lines of code so in a similar way you can add action events to other menu items also okay so in this way you can use menu bars menu and menu items in JavaFX I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
