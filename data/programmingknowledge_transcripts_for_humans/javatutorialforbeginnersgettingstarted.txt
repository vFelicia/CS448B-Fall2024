00:00 - hey guys welcome to the very first video
00:02 - of this tutorial series wherein we'll be
00:04 - learning Java along with the DSA so
00:07 - myself aniket I'll be I'll be your
00:09 - instructor throughout this course where
00:11 - we where we'll be learning Java
00:13 - programming language starting from the
00:15 - basics to the core Java Concepts and
00:18 - along after that we will dive deep into
00:21 - the data structures and algorithms using
00:24 - and we will try to implement that using
00:26 - Java programming language
00:28 - so first of all starting with the
00:30 - introduction you would ask me to
00:33 - which person can take this course so I
00:35 - would say uh anyone who wants to learn
00:38 - the Java programming language right from
00:40 - the beginning till the advanced data
00:42 - structures can take this course
00:45 - okay so in this video we'll be talking
00:47 - about the installation part which are
00:48 - which softwares are required you to run
00:51 - the Java program inside your PC
00:53 - so start let's let's get started open
00:57 - your Chrome
00:58 - and head over to the Chrome and desk
01:00 - Type download
01:03 - jdk and search
01:07 - you will be seeing first link which is
01:09 - of your Oracle one and just go there and
01:13 - according to your OS whether we are
01:15 - using Mac OS linear coex Linux or
01:17 - Windows just to choose your windows OS
01:20 - and according to your installer
01:24 - just click on this and this will get
01:26 - downloaded in your system I have already
01:29 - downloaded it so I don't download it
01:32 - again or I will pause it
01:34 - okay and the next thing you will require
01:36 - is IDE so what is ID basically ID is an
01:41 - environment where you code uh your Java
01:44 - Java programs and basically what is the
01:47 - difference between an ID and notepad you
01:49 - can also code in the notepad but the
01:51 - better way of the better way of using
01:53 - the IDE is you can get a auto suggestion
01:56 - of those code Snippets and uh and
01:59 - there's in Auto indentation is there in
02:01 - The Insider ID so I suggest one of the
02:04 - best ID to code the Java programs is
02:07 - IntelliJ IDEA so you just go into your
02:10 - browser and type
02:14 - download
02:15 - in Delhi J
02:18 - idea
02:21 - so first link comes of jetbrains who are
02:24 - the developer of this ID
02:26 - go there and click on this Community
02:28 - Edition Community Edition because don't
02:31 - download the ultimate edition you'll be
02:33 - charged after the 30 days free trial so
02:35 - so we want the free tile so go here and
02:39 - download the exe file or zip file
02:41 - whatever you want I suggest to download
02:43 - exe file click on the download and after
02:48 - two to three seconds your download will
02:49 - get started I also downloaded this files
02:52 - so I don't download it again
02:55 - okay after downloading this file you
02:58 - just go there inside the full downloads
03:01 - folder and click on the jdk file
03:04 - double click on it
03:05 - it will ask for the permission click yes
03:12 - okay
03:14 - click next
03:15 - then keep the path as default
03:19 - okay so wait here the jdk will get
03:23 - installed in your PC
03:27 - simultaneously I will also install a
03:30 - IntelliJ IDEA
03:34 - okay
03:35 - wait
03:38 - hello here
03:40 - so it was saying the current uh IntelliJ
03:43 - Community Edition is already installed
03:45 - so I have already installed it so you
03:47 - just follow all the steps which uh just
03:49 - you need to click next next next and
03:51 - IntelliJ IDEA will get installed in your
03:53 - PC
03:54 - okay
03:55 - so here you can see uh my jdk will also
03:59 - get down installed in my PC just close
04:01 - here and you need to go to the path
04:04 - which which you have given uh at the
04:07 - time of the jdk installation so here I
04:09 - given the path inside my Java folder I
04:12 - have jdk file and you just go inside the
04:15 - bin folder and just click here and copy
04:18 - the path
04:19 - I am again repeating just go to that
04:22 - path where you have installed the jdk
04:24 - and inside the jdk folder you have bin
04:27 - folder just click here and copy this
04:30 - path and and go to your start and type
04:34 - edit
04:35 - and you will be seeing edit the system
04:37 - variables here
04:39 - just click on it and click here edit
04:41 - environment
04:43 - and inside the user variable for the
04:46 - user just go here and click on the path
04:49 - and click edit and you will be seeing
04:52 - here new button you click on this and

05:02 - and okay
05:04 - so till now you have successfully
05:07 - installed all the softwares which are
05:09 - required you to run the Java programs
05:11 - inside your PC
05:13 - okay to test it out uh whether whether
05:16 - all this installation parties get
05:19 - succeed successfully installed just
05:22 - press the windows R but as a button on a
05:25 - keyboard and type CMD here and enter and
05:28 - just type Java minus minus version
05:33 - and after hitting enter you will be
05:35 - seeing the jacquer and Java version
05:37 - which is installed in a PC and jdk
05:40 - version which is also installed in in
05:42 - your PC okay
05:44 - so till now we have seen the
05:46 - introduction and installation part which
05:48 - are required for you to run a Java
05:51 - program in your inside your PC okay uh
05:53 - so after that
05:55 - you have also I am assuming that you
05:57 - have also installed IntelliJ IDEA in
05:59 - your PC just click here open your open
06:03 - your IDE it will take some time
06:06 - according to the system configuration of
06:08 - your laptop or PC
06:11 - okay just wait here
06:14 - I'll be seeing this okay
06:18 - wait

06:23 - you want I will be giving hello
06:27 - and I will be creating clicking on the
06:29 - next
06:30 - okay after creating a new project inside
06:32 - IntelliJ IDEA the this window get pop up
06:35 - and inside source you can see the main
06:39 - file is there
06:41 - okay so this is the basic code
06:44 - that IntelliJ IDEA will provide you okay
06:48 - and after inside this you can code
06:50 - whatever you want in Java programming
06:54 - language so till now I hope all the all
06:57 - of you have installed or all the
06:59 - required softwares and and till now you
07:02 - are rich at this point where you will be
07:04 - will be starting to code inside IDE
07:08 - so one more thing is there uh I'll be
07:10 - planning to give you some extra
07:14 - questions code like coding questions
07:16 - I'll become like for example I will be
07:18 - covering variables and data types and
07:20 - then again in the next question next
07:23 - video I will be giving you the problems
07:25 - or some coding questions uh regarding
07:28 - that Concepts which I have taught you in
07:31 - the previous videos so I expect expect
07:34 - you to answer those questions inside uh
07:37 - comment comment box of that video and
07:40 - I'll be reviewing your comments in the
07:42 - upcoming videos and we'll be talking
07:44 - some which are which Solutions is best
