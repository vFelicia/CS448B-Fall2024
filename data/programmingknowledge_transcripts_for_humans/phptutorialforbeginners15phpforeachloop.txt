00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use for each Loop in
00:05 - your PHP code okay so there is one more
00:09 - kind of a loop called for each Loop
00:12 - which is also used for iterating values
00:15 - uh in your PHP code so for example I
00:20 - have shown you in the previous video how
00:22 - to declare an array right for example I
00:26 - have an array of these
00:28 - names and what uh this array contains
00:33 - three names for example I can add one
00:36 - more name for
00:42 - example and one more
00:45 - name this has five names
00:50 - right okay so this name array has five
00:54 - name in it and I want to uh print all
00:58 - the names one by one without using the
01:03 - key of these elements how can I do it I
01:07 - can use for each Loop and how you can
01:09 - declare for each Loop
01:13 - for each and then the condition and then
01:18 - these curly braces you can declare it
01:21 - like this and here you can give the name
01:26 - of the
01:27 - array or whatever value you want to
01:30 - iterate and then give a keyword as and
01:35 - then declare your own variable which
01:38 - will contain these name one by one so I
01:43 - will say this is a name instead of names
01:47 - this is names which last from which has
01:51 - the ending with s and this is a name you
01:55 - can uh name it anything but logically I
01:58 - name it as name and this variable will
02:02 - contain this name one by one okay so
02:06 - basically what we are saying here in uh
02:09 - in using for each Loop that give me from
02:13 - this array every element one by one and
02:18 - pass it here one by one so that we can
02:21 - use it so for example I want to print
02:23 - this I can just
02:25 - write
02:27 - Echo and then
02:31 - then I can just uh use my name variable
02:36 - here and I can concatenate this with a
02:39 - break so that it will be easier to see
02:43 - BR okay I save it and when I run
02:48 - this I see an error let's see
02:53 - why okay I haven't provided this
02:56 - semicolon here okay just provide the sem
02:59 - me colon here and run the program once
03:02 - again and it gives me all the names one
03:05 - by one Whatever names are there in the
03:10 - list so this for each Loop we use it to
03:15 - iterate the values or elements in the
03:18 - array one by one okay and this uh
03:22 - elements will be contain in this
03:25 - variable which you declare after as okay
03:29 - so this is single dimensional array and
03:32 - you can iterate it easily but what if
03:37 - it's a multi-dimensional array and if
03:41 - it's a multi-dimensional array uh in the
03:45 - I think uh in the previous video I've
03:47 - shown you how to use multiple
03:49 - dimensional arrays so for example we
03:51 - have this multi-dimensional array from
03:54 - our previous videos so I will delete all
03:57 - this code from here and
04:00 - if you remember we have declared this uh
04:03 - multi-dimensional array in the video
04:07 - where we have seen how to use this
04:09 - multiple dimensional array right now if
04:12 - you want to uh iterate this value how
04:14 - you can do it because this is in Array
04:17 - inside an array and then the values of
04:20 - array in
04:22 - associative array right so you can do it
04:27 - something like this you can just
04:30 - right
04:32 - for each and give a Loops something like
04:37 - this and inside this I will just first
04:40 - of all name my
04:42 - array my basic array is this
04:46 - as
04:47 - my variable name whatever I want to
04:51 - iterate the elements of the array so I
04:54 - can say
04:55 - student this is
04:57 - students right and this will
05:00 - be this will contain student right and
05:06 - so what are there in the
05:10 - student we have three different values
05:14 - inside our student array so this is the
05:17 - student this is the array and we have
05:20 - three different value one two and three
05:25 - right and the key of this value is zero
05:31 - key of this value is one and key of this
05:34 - value is two so whenever we uh whenever
05:38 - we Echo
05:40 - this Echo and whenever we uh Echo
05:45 - student dot
05:50 - break BR and when we save it and run it
05:54 - it'll give us the key of this once again
05:57 - I think I forgot this one one save
06:02 - it and it will give the key hopefully
06:07 - no so it's giving us error because we
06:12 - need
06:13 - to indicate somehow that it has some
06:18 - array inside it you can see the error
06:21 - that the value you are trying to show is
06:24 - an array so it will not print this
06:26 - because you print string values using
06:29 - this Echo right so you need to write
06:31 - here equal
06:33 - to like this and then you can say this
06:38 - is my so this student
06:41 - contain a array which has three element
06:45 - and then inside this we have another
06:47 - array which is this student and then we
06:50 - want to iterate the value of this right
06:53 - so we can say this is
06:56 - a in
06:58 - a
07:00 - array or whatever you want to say it and
07:04 - then whenever you want you print
07:07 - this then let's see what
07:12 - happens I want to save this for
07:17 - example okay so for now we use this here
07:22 - and I save
07:23 - it that gives me index 012 right so this
07:29 - is giving me the key of this array this
07:33 - has three uh three values which has the
07:37 - key zero one and two now I want to
07:40 - iterate the value here these all values
07:44 - how I can do it now I have all the
07:47 - values in here for array one array two
07:50 - and array three so what I can do is I
07:53 - can use for each Loop inside for each
07:56 - Loop second for each Loop here to
07:59 - iterate the values of inner
08:02 - arrays okay so I just Echo it like this
08:07 - but this time I want to use this inner
08:10 - array as
08:13 - my primary array as for example
08:18 - items or item item is a more lo logical
08:23 - thing and I will make
08:26 - this bold
08:29 - so I will just make this bold so that we
08:33 - will be able to see
08:35 - this
08:37 - B and here we will end our B like this
08:44 - okay so let's see what happens I just
08:48 - save it and I run
08:52 - this
08:57 - and I need to give here
08:59 - concatenation
09:02 - operator and now you can
09:05 - see our zeroth uh key contains these
09:10 - values Mark as a name weight 15 and uh
09:15 - age 15 and weight uh 46 then
09:20 - John we age 13 and weight 65 Tom age 14
09:26 - and weight this one so in this way you
09:28 - can it rate the multi-dimensional array
09:31 - using for each Loop but you have need to
09:34 - use uh two for each Loop one to iterate
09:39 - this array outer array which contains
09:42 - three keys and other to uh uh iterate
09:47 - the values of second array okay so in
09:52 - this way you can use for each Loop in
09:54 - PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video
09:56 - please R comment and subscribe and bye
09:58 - for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use for each Loop in your PHP code okay so there is one more kind of a loop called for each Loop which is also used for iterating values uh in your PHP code so for example I have shown you in the previous video how to declare an array right for example I have an array of these names and what uh this array contains three names for example I can add one more name for example and one more name this has five names right okay so this name array has five name in it and I want to uh print all the names one by one without using the key of these elements how can I do it I can use for each Loop and how you can declare for each Loop for each and then the condition and then these curly braces you can declare it like this and here you can give the name of the array or whatever value you want to iterate and then give a keyword as and then declare your own variable which will contain these name one by one so I will say this is a name instead of names this is names which last from which has the ending with s and this is a name you can uh name it anything but logically I name it as name and this variable will contain this name one by one okay so basically what we are saying here in uh in using for each Loop that give me from this array every element one by one and pass it here one by one so that we can use it so for example I want to print this I can just write Echo and then then I can just uh use my name variable here and I can concatenate this with a break so that it will be easier to see BR okay I save it and when I run this I see an error let's see why okay I haven't provided this semicolon here okay just provide the sem me colon here and run the program once again and it gives me all the names one by one Whatever names are there in the list so this for each Loop we use it to iterate the values or elements in the array one by one okay and this uh elements will be contain in this variable which you declare after as okay so this is single dimensional array and you can iterate it easily but what if it's a multidimensional array and if it's a multidimensional array uh in the I think uh in the previous video I've shown you how to use multiple dimensional arrays so for example we have this multidimensional array from our previous videos so I will delete all this code from here and if you remember we have declared this uh multidimensional array in the video where we have seen how to use this multiple dimensional array right now if you want to uh iterate this value how you can do it because this is in Array inside an array and then the values of array in associative array right so you can do it something like this you can just right for each and give a Loops something like this and inside this I will just first of all name my array my basic array is this as my variable name whatever I want to iterate the elements of the array so I can say student this is students right and this will be this will contain student right and so what are there in the student we have three different values inside our student array so this is the student this is the array and we have three different value one two and three right and the key of this value is zero key of this value is one and key of this value is two so whenever we uh whenever we Echo this Echo and whenever we uh Echo student dot break BR and when we save it and run it it'll give us the key of this once again I think I forgot this one one save it and it will give the key hopefully no so it's giving us error because we need to indicate somehow that it has some array inside it you can see the error that the value you are trying to show is an array so it will not print this because you print string values using this Echo right so you need to write here equal to like this and then you can say this is my so this student contain a array which has three element and then inside this we have another array which is this student and then we want to iterate the value of this right so we can say this is a in a array or whatever you want to say it and then whenever you want you print this then let's see what happens I want to save this for example okay so for now we use this here and I save it that gives me index 012 right so this is giving me the key of this array this has three uh three values which has the key zero one and two now I want to iterate the value here these all values how I can do it now I have all the values in here for array one array two and array three so what I can do is I can use for each Loop inside for each Loop second for each Loop here to iterate the values of inner arrays okay so I just Echo it like this but this time I want to use this inner array as my primary array as for example items or item item is a more lo logical thing and I will make this bold so I will just make this bold so that we will be able to see this B and here we will end our B like this okay so let's see what happens I just save it and I run this and I need to give here concatenation operator and now you can see our zeroth uh key contains these values Mark as a name weight 15 and uh age 15 and weight uh 46 then John we age 13 and weight 65 Tom age 14 and weight this one so in this way you can it rate the multidimensional array using for each Loop but you have need to use uh two for each Loop one to iterate this array outer array which contains three keys and other to uh uh iterate the values of second array okay so in this way you can use for each Loop in PHP I hope you have enjoyed this video please R
