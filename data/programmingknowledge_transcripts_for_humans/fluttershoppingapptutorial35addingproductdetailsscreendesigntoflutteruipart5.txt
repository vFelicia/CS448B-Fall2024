With timestamps:

00:00 - the previous video we were able to
00:02 - display this image and the price per kg
00:05 - so in this video we are gonna make the
00:08 - rest of the ui and i have decided that
00:10 - i'll also make this ui and it will be
00:13 - static for now and once we make the
00:16 - apis for them we'll connect it with them
00:20 - so let's open our code editor i'll do a
00:23 - full restart
00:24 - to see if everything is working fine or
00:26 - not
00:32 - so we are getting the sellers now if i
00:34 - click on any seller
00:36 - their products are being shown
00:39 - okay i'll
00:41 - choose broccoli and then broccoli is
00:44 - being shown over here and it's
00:46 - price so this is in product details
00:49 - screen and i think i have not added the
00:52 - font over here
00:54 - so
00:55 - i'm gonna do that now
00:58 - the style
01:01 - is gonna be
01:02 - google style
01:06 - uh sorry google fonts
01:08 - dot pop pins
01:10 - okay i think
01:12 - this is enough so let me format it
01:19 - okay it is taking some time to download
01:22 - this poppins
01:23 - okay so once this is done i'll do a full
01:25 - restart and we have our font over here
01:28 - so let's continue now next thing is we
01:30 - have to add a description over here okay
01:33 - so
01:35 - this is the product image product price
01:38 - per kg this is the container
01:40 - over here we are gonna add the
01:44 - description
01:47 - so description is again gonna be a
01:50 - text field
01:51 - sorry it is gonna be a container
01:55 - okay
01:56 - and
01:57 - the container inside this will have our
02:00 - text field because of the issue we faced
02:02 - over here
02:03 - now again i wanted switch to be the
02:05 - entire screen width and the padding
02:08 - should be equal to the padding that we
02:09 - have given over here so that the entire
02:12 - text looks aligned so i'm gonna copy it
02:15 - paste it over here
02:18 - okay
02:18 - the error is because i'm missing a comma
02:20 - over here
02:22 - now inside this there is a text field
02:25 - okay sorry
02:26 - the child is a text field
02:30 - okay and the
02:32 - text is nothing but product dot and
02:35 - description
02:37 - okay
02:39 - let's see how it looks
02:42 - so we are getting a description over
02:44 - here but it doesn't look
02:46 - pretty
02:47 - so
02:48 - let us fix that
02:50 - what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make the
02:52 - padding 40 so that we get little bit of
02:56 - extra space
02:59 - okay and i want to leave the same amount
03:01 - of padding from right side as well so
03:04 - either i can change add a right over
03:06 - here or change this only to symmetric
03:09 - i'm gonna change it to symmetric
03:12 - and this is gonna be the horizontal axis
03:16 - yeah
03:18 - let me save this
03:20 - okay this looks better
03:22 - now i also
03:24 - need to add a padding from the top but i
03:27 - am not sure if i need it from the bottom
03:30 - i am gonna add it from both sides for
03:32 - now
03:33 - but if
03:34 - later i don't need it i'll again switch
03:36 - back to only
03:39 - so i think 10 should do
03:41 - let's see
03:43 - yes it looks fine
03:45 - now let's come to our text
03:47 - style and the style is again gonna be
03:50 - text style
03:53 - sorry
03:54 - we don't want text style we want google
03:57 - fonts dot pop-ins
04:02 - okay
04:04 - now over here i'm gonna change the color
04:07 - okay the color is gonna be this color
04:17 - okay
04:21 - now let me add a comma let's format it
04:24 - let's see
04:25 - okay so it has converted to pop-ins but
04:27 - it is taking too much of space
04:30 - so what we can do is we can
04:33 - like remove some part of it for now
04:35 - like
04:36 - we can add our c-more option if we want
04:39 - for that we can use the rich text field
04:42 - but i am not gonna do that i am simply
04:44 - gonna
04:45 - clip certain part of the text
04:47 - okay but if you want to add the see more
04:49 - ncls option you can do that rich text is
04:53 - the
04:54 - way to do it dot
04:57 - i think it was a sub text or
05:01 - sub string yeah
05:03 - so i want from 0 to 120 let's see how
05:06 - much that is
05:09 - now it is way too less
05:11 - let's make it 150
05:13 - because actually over here the
05:16 - description wouldn't matter if you think
05:18 - from the product perspective
05:20 - the vegetable picture in itself
05:22 - tells everything
05:26 - okay 180 is giving us five lines let's
05:29 - see how much warren was in the design
05:32 - it was near around five
05:35 - lines so i think
05:36 - the text is done for now
05:41 - let me format it save it so we have our
05:44 - text in place
05:46 - now after text
05:48 - we have a
05:49 - review section
05:54 - product
05:55 - review
05:57 - okay so over here first we have a
06:00 - container
06:04 - okay that is understandable
06:07 - now this container
06:09 - will have our decoration
06:11 - the decoration is gonna be box
06:14 - decoration
06:15 - okay and generally in
06:18 - decoration we always have boxer
06:19 - decoration the color is gonna be gray
06:24 - color again i'll use the colors enum
06:26 - colors dot gray
06:29 - i'm sorry
06:31 - colors dot gray
06:33 - let's see how this looks
06:37 - okay where is the container i think
06:40 - i need to specify a height so i'm gonna
06:43 - give it a height of
06:45 - 50 for now
06:50 - so this is our container and this is not
06:53 - the gray we want so we can use different
06:56 - versions of it by just adding numbers
06:59 - into the square bracket
07:01 - so the numbers are like 100 200 300
07:03 - where 100 being the lightest shade and
07:06 - 800 or 900 being like and as you
07:10 - uh like increase the numbers the shades
07:12 - get darker that is the just
07:15 - so 200 is way too
07:18 - light i'm gonna make it four let's see
07:23 - now four is again too much
07:25 - let's make it three
07:27 - now let's check in our design i think
07:30 - three would do for now
07:32 - okay
07:33 - so
07:37 - let's give it a width
07:39 - or instead of giving it a width we can
07:42 - simply apply padding from both the sides
07:44 - or maybe margin margin is the way to go
07:46 - because padding will again the
07:48 - background color will be in the padded
07:50 - area as well so margin is the way to go
07:53 - margin
07:55 - const so now
07:56 - so i automatically put const over there
07:59 - because of
08:00 - because of the
08:02 - so many warnings that we got
08:04 - so now it has kind of become a habit
08:07 - so horizontal
08:09 - let's say 30.
08:14 - yeah so this looks fine
08:16 - um
08:17 - okay for now
08:20 - and the height can be 100
08:24 - see how much that is okay we can start
08:27 - with this for now we can again later
08:30 - change the height and margins if needed
08:33 - so now let's add border radius
08:39 - border radius dot circular
08:43 - i guess yes and 5.0
08:47 - okay let's see
08:51 - let's confirm it in our design
08:55 - i don't think it is 5 yes it is 15 so
09:01 - let's see
09:06 - yeah so the 15 here and 15 there is the
09:10 - same thing
09:13 - okay so now let's continue what i'm
09:15 - gonna do is i'm gonna take it to another
09:17 - screen
09:18 - so that i don't have to keep on
09:20 - flipping
09:22 - if you want to look the design the
09:24 - design link should be in the description
09:27 - okay
09:28 - so now after let's come back here
09:32 - now
09:33 - now that we have a container
09:36 - let's add the items that are inside it
09:39 - so along with this i am gonna add a
09:41 - padding over here so that the contents
09:44 - don't start appearing at the corner okay
09:47 - padding
09:50 - agent sets
09:52 - all
09:54 - 10.0
09:56 - let's see
09:58 - okay
09:59 - we will not see any visible change sorry
10:01 - for

Cleaned transcript:

the previous video we were able to display this image and the price per kg so in this video we are gonna make the rest of the ui and i have decided that i'll also make this ui and it will be static for now and once we make the apis for them we'll connect it with them so let's open our code editor i'll do a full restart to see if everything is working fine or not so we are getting the sellers now if i click on any seller their products are being shown okay i'll choose broccoli and then broccoli is being shown over here and it's price so this is in product details screen and i think i have not added the font over here so i'm gonna do that now the style is gonna be google style uh sorry google fonts dot pop pins okay i think this is enough so let me format it okay it is taking some time to download this poppins okay so once this is done i'll do a full restart and we have our font over here so let's continue now next thing is we have to add a description over here okay so this is the product image product price per kg this is the container over here we are gonna add the description so description is again gonna be a text field sorry it is gonna be a container okay and the container inside this will have our text field because of the issue we faced over here now again i wanted switch to be the entire screen width and the padding should be equal to the padding that we have given over here so that the entire text looks aligned so i'm gonna copy it paste it over here okay the error is because i'm missing a comma over here now inside this there is a text field okay sorry the child is a text field okay and the text is nothing but product dot and description okay let's see how it looks so we are getting a description over here but it doesn't look pretty so let us fix that what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make the padding 40 so that we get little bit of extra space okay and i want to leave the same amount of padding from right side as well so either i can change add a right over here or change this only to symmetric i'm gonna change it to symmetric and this is gonna be the horizontal axis yeah let me save this okay this looks better now i also need to add a

way too less let's make it 150 because actually over here the description wouldn't matter if you think from the product perspective the vegetable picture in itself tells everything okay 180 is giving us five lines let's see how much warren was in the design it was near around five lines so i think the text is done for now let me format it save it so we have our text in place now after text we have a review section product review okay so over here first we have a container okay that is understandable now this container will have our decoration the decoration is gonna be box decoration okay and generally in decoration we always have boxer decoration the color is gonna be gray color again i'll use the colors enum colors dot gray i'm sorry colors dot gray let's see how this looks okay where is the container i think i need to specify a height so i'm gonna give it a height of 50 for now so this is our container and this is not the gray we want so we can use different versions of it by just adding numbers into the square bracket so the numbers are like 100 200 300 where 100 being the lightest shade and 800 or 900 being like and as you uh like increase the numbers the shades get darker that is the just so 200 is way too light i'm gonna make it four let's see now four is again too much let's make it three now let's check in our design i think three would do for now okay so let's give it a width or instead of giving it a width we can simply apply padding from both the sides or maybe margin margin is the way to go because padding will again the background color will be in the padded area as well so margin is the way to go margin const so now so i automatically put const over there because of because of the so many warnings that we got so now it has kind of become a habit so horizontal let's say 30. yeah so this looks fine um okay for now and the height can be 100 see how much that is okay we can start with this for now we can again later change the height and margins if needed so now let's add border radius border radius dot circular i guess yes and 5.0 okay let's see let's confirm it in our design i don't think it is 5 yes it is 15 so let's see yeah so the 15 here
