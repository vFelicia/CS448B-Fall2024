00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge with this video we are
00:04 - starting with new programming series
00:06 - which is based upon postgresql so before
00:09 - going further
00:10 - let us first discuss about what is
00:14 - database first of all what is data
00:18 - in simple words data can be fact related
00:20 - to any object in consideration
00:23 - if we consider a human object then name
00:26 - age height weight etc anything that can
00:29 - define a person is a data
00:33 - a data has many format it can be text
00:36 - number picture image file pdf etc
00:41 - that all be considered as data
00:45 - now what is database databases support
00:48 - storage
00:49 - and manipulation of data if we have data
00:53 - we need something to manipulate that
00:55 - data
00:56 - that's why database come into picture if
00:59 - you consider an
01:00 - online telephone directory definitely it
01:03 - is a database because it store people
01:06 - information like
01:07 - numbers contact details and we use
01:10 - this telephone directory to find the
01:12 - data
01:14 - if we consider a social network like
01:16 - facebook
01:18 - it contains data about people
01:21 - their friends their activities messages
01:24 - advertisements and a lot small which is
01:27 - also a database
01:30 - now to manage all of this database we
01:33 - need a system
01:34 - that is called database management
01:36 - system and that's why
01:38 - postgres will come into picture
01:41 - postgresql is a powerful and open source
01:44 - object relational database that uses and
01:47 - extends this sql language combined with
01:50 - many features that safely store and
01:53 - scale the most
01:54 - complicated data workloads it
01:57 - supports asset properties some of
02:00 - you may not aware of what is asset
02:03 - properties
02:04 - so let me tell that first in asset
02:07 - property
02:08 - a stands for atomicity it means that
02:12 - either all the instruction follows or
02:15 - neither should be
02:17 - it must be atomic c
02:20 - stands for consistency after performing
02:24 - sql queries your data your database must
02:28 - be consistent
02:30 - i stands for integrity integrity
02:34 - means all the transaction should perform
02:38 - independently they do not depends on
02:41 - each other
02:42 - and lastly d stands for durability
02:46 - which means reliability your database
02:48 - must be durable
02:50 - so you can get the right data
02:53 - now postgresql runs on all the major
02:56 - operating system whether it is
02:58 - windows mac or linux and
03:01 - it is no surprise that oscar sql has
03:04 - become the open source
03:05 - lesson database of choice for many
03:07 - people
03:08 - and organizations it provides
03:11 - so many of features that nowadays
03:14 - most of the organization uses the
03:16 - postgresql
03:19 - it comes with many features like
03:22 - administrator to protect data integrity
03:25 - and build fault tolerant environment and
03:28 - helps you to manage your data no matter
03:30 - how big
03:30 - or small the data set whether your
03:33 - database is small
03:34 - or big you can use postgresql
03:37 - we can also extends our database for
03:40 - example
03:41 - we can define our own data types our own
03:44 - custom function
03:45 - and we can even write code from
03:47 - different programming languages
03:49 - without recompiling your database that
03:52 - means
03:52 - a single database can be used with
03:55 - multiple programming languages
03:58 - now this is the main features
04:01 - of the postgresql first of all data
04:05 - types
04:06 - it supports
04:09 - most of the data types whether this
04:11 - integer float
04:14 - or string or character or where care or
04:17 - every type of database
04:21 - data integrity as i
04:24 - as i told you in data integrity
04:28 - in asset property all the transaction
04:31 - should be performed independently it is
04:34 - a reliable
04:34 - and disaster recovery it also provides
04:37 - supports for recovery
04:40 - security it is secure and extensibility
04:43 - means we can write our own custom
04:45 - function
04:45 - our own data types in this video
04:48 - we will learn how to install postgres
04:51 - sql
04:52 - in your mac operating system
04:55 - the first step is open your browser
05:00 - just type post
05:03 - gray sql
05:08 - here the first search result it shows
05:12 - postgresql.org just click on that
05:23 - now go to download options
05:31 - here you can see mac operating system
05:35 - just click on that
05:42 - now there are several ways to download
05:44 - postgresql
05:46 - this is download the installer
05:50 - this is postgres.app we are going to use
05:54 - this
05:54 - just click on this
06:02 - go to downloads
06:05 - and here you can download
06:17 - so once you download it just open that
06:21 - i am going to wait because i have
06:24 - already downloaded it
06:26 - just open that dmg file
06:37 - now you just need to drag these postgres
06:41 - and drop into application folder
06:53 - okay
06:59 - you can see in your applications this is
07:02 - post place
07:03 - just click on that
07:14 - you can see here empty data dictionary
07:19 - we can start our server by initializing
07:22 - it
07:28 - you can see several users in this
07:32 - vijayanam post place and this is
07:35 - template one
07:36 - now the final step is
07:40 - just go to the introduction
07:45 - we have initialized the server now
07:48 - we need to configure our path
07:51 - so just copy this entire command
07:58 - open your terminal
08:11 - and just paste it over here press enter
08:15 - and this will last for your mac password
08:18 - so enter your mac password
08:26 - now you just need to restart the
08:28 - terminal
08:30 - minimize it
08:38 - okay
08:45 - now write psql
08:53 - hyphen here for user and
08:57 - this is a name which is post creates
09:00 - just write post grace
09:04 - and you can see our server has been
09:07 - started
09:09 - to see the list of databases you can
09:12 - write
09:13 - backslash list
09:20 - okay
09:22 - now to create database we can use create
09:29 - database and the name of the database
09:33 - and semicolon enter
09:37 - you can see our database is created
09:42 - as list
09:49 - and you can see our database test is
09:51 - created
09:54 - this is how you can install postgresql
09:57 - in your mac
09:57 - browser in this video we will see how to
10:00 - install
10:01 - postgresql on windows operating system
10:05 - so just open your browser
10:15 - okay so type postgresql here
10:25 - here's the first post ksql.org
10:29 - just click on that
10:35 - here you can see in download option just
10:38 - click
10:42 - here you can get various packages for
10:45 - various operating system like

11:12 - os
11:12 - and windows 64-bit
11:16 - linux is not available yet if you want
11:19 - to
11:20 - install for linux then you have to
11:23 - download
11:23 - 10.10 so choose whatever
11:26 - you want to choose that suits your
11:29 - opening system
11:32 - i'll download windows 64 version
11:47 - okay so you can save i already got the
11:52 - file so i just cancel it
11:56 - so once the download is finished just
11:59 - click on the
12:08 - file
12:12 - next this is the path where postgresql
12:17 - version 12 will be installed
12:22 - okay so this setup will install
12:25 - postgresql server
12:27 - pg admin 4 which is the gui based
12:31 - application to run your sql queries
12:34 - stake pictures for extra drivers and
12:37 - command line tools
12:38 - click on next next
12:50 - next
12:57 - this will take some time
13:04 - okay our installation has done
13:08 - and this is the stack builder stack
13:12 - builder is used to
13:14 - install various drives for like python
13:17 - or c plus plus so
13:20 - let me just finish
13:26 - here is the setup for stack builder
13:29 - if you have a remote server then you can
13:32 - choose remote server
13:34 - but i choose local
13:46 - next
13:50 - okay so this is the drivers you can
13:53 - get database drivers database server
13:57 - web development and tools and utilities
14:00 - but
14:00 - as of now i don't want either of
14:04 - them so i just click on the cancel
14:09 - okay so poster sql has been installed on
14:12 - our windows opening system
14:15 - you can get it here from the start menu
14:25 - post sql version 12 you can see stack
14:29 - builder
14:30 - pga admin for documentation shell
14:33 - just click on pg admin for
15:10 - so
15:24 - so
15:43 - okay so click on the servers
15:46 - this is postpass quality the
15:50 - postgres is the database you can find
15:53 - schema
15:54 - in public you have tables the tables
15:57 - which you will create
15:59 - is shown here
16:02 - [Music]
16:04 - there is a query tool
16:08 - and here you will write your sql queries
16:12 - so this is how you can install postgre
16:15 - sql and pg admin 4 on your windows based
16:18 - operating system
16:19 - in this video we will see how to create
16:22 - a database
16:23 - in postgresql so first of all
16:26 - just open your terminal
16:30 - it doesn't matter whether you are using
16:33 - mac open system
16:34 - windows or ubuntu just open your
16:36 - terminal or command prompt
16:43 - so write psql
16:49 - now whenever you press enter after
16:51 - writing psqa
16:53 - you are into postfast fuel command
16:56 - prompt
16:57 - now in order to see which are the
17:00 - databases
17:01 - that are present in your system you just
17:04 - need to write backslash
17:05 - and then press enter
17:09 - here you can see the name of the
17:11 - databases
17:13 - postgres template one template
17:20 - okay press q for exit
17:23 - now we will create a new database so in
17:26 - order to create
17:27 - a database you need to write a simple
17:31 - command
17:32 - write create
17:35 - then database
17:39 - then provide name of the database
17:42 - let's write test semicolon
17:46 - press enter okay
17:50 - so our database is created
17:53 - let me show you backslash help
17:57 - here you can see our database is created
18:01 - and it is created by me so the owner is
18:04 - vision of one okay
18:08 - guys now
18:12 - in order to draw means delete a database
18:15 - there is a command which is drop just
18:19 - write
18:19 - drop then
18:23 - name of the database
18:29 - then name of the database
18:36 - now let's see
18:40 - hey you can see our database test is
18:43 - deleted okay
18:46 - press q again now in order to
18:50 - connect to a database uh there's a
18:53 - command
18:54 - backslash c c stands for connect
18:58 - then name of the database that you want
19:02 - to connect
19:04 - post waves let's say
19:08 - so here you can see you are now
19:10 - connected to database
19:11 - post crease as user and the username
19:15 - so this is how you can create a database
19:18 - draw for database and connect to a
19:21 - database in command prompt
19:23 - but we have a better gui option
19:27 - let me just close it
19:31 - now there are several gui's
19:35 - environment available for postgresql in
19:37 - the market
19:38 - which i suggest you to use is this one
19:43 - pg admin this is the version
19:46 - you can download it for any open system
19:48 - you are using whether it is
19:50 - windows ubuntu or mac just
19:53 - google pg admin and download the version
19:56 - that suits to your computer
19:59 - open it
20:03 - so this is how it looks it opens in the
20:05 - browser
20:07 - so this is the servers just click on
20:10 - that
20:11 - i already create one server which i
20:13 - named
20:14 - learn but if you want to create a new
20:17 - server just
20:18 - right click on it create and then server
20:24 - here you can provide the name of your
20:27 - server
20:28 - and in connection field you can give the
20:32 - address to the server or
20:36 - host name if you do not want to connect
20:39 - to a specific server just write
20:41 - localhost okay
20:45 - so this is our server and this is the
20:48 - databases
20:50 - so
20:56 - here you can see this is the icon for
20:59 - query tool
21:00 - just click on that
21:03 - this area you can see here you can write
21:06 - your all
21:07 - sql queries so
21:10 - let us create one database
21:14 - create database
21:17 - the name of the database text
21:22 - now here you can see the icon
21:27 - it says execute so
21:33 - yes very much sorry for that create
21:36 - database text
21:40 - now just right click on and refresh
21:44 - here you can see our database is created
21:49 - now in order to drop the database it is
21:52 - pretty much
21:52 - the same as we have done in the command
21:56 - prompt
22:10 - f5 is software key for execute
22:14 - again i refresh and you can see
22:18 - so this is how you can create and draw
22:21 - the database basically
22:23 - in our previous video we saw that how to
22:25 - create and drop a database
22:27 - and in this video i'm gonna show you how
22:30 - to create a table
22:31 - so first of all you need to open your
22:33 - terminal or command prompt
22:40 - write psql
22:44 - now let us see which are the databases
22:47 - present in our system
22:48 - write backslash l
22:52 - here you can see we have a test database
22:55 - and we are going to use that one so
22:59 - for connect to the test database right
23:02 - let's see you can name the database
23:06 - semicolon now we are connected to
23:08 - database
23:09 - test now we need to create a table
23:13 - which present in this test database
23:17 - so the command is created
23:22 - table then name of the table
23:27 - let's say employee
23:32 - now brackets
23:35 - small brackets in small brackets
23:39 - uh we provide the name of the columns
23:42 - and
23:42 - their respective data types now there
23:45 - are
23:46 - various data types available in
23:47 - postgraduate sql
23:49 - that you can use like if you
23:52 - want to use numbers then you can use
23:55 - integer
23:56 - begin small and float real
24:00 - if you want to store character then you
24:02 - can use care
24:03 - where care and you can also use text for
24:06 - long term
24:07 - so if you want to know about if you want
24:10 - to know
24:11 - more about data types then you can
24:14 - go to the documentation of post
24:18 - so let us say first column is name
24:23 - and i want data type
24:29 - of length 10 10 is the
24:32 - length of the name column
24:37 - then i use id
24:41 - and id
24:45 - okay now the most important thing
24:49 - in the table is primary key
24:53 - i defined id as my primary key for the
24:57 - employee table
24:59 - now what is the primary key well we
25:02 - will discuss more about primary key in
25:05 - our later videos
25:06 - but for now for the sake of convenience
25:09 - you just need to know that every table
25:11 - must have
25:12 - a primary key a column defined as a
25:16 - primary key
25:17 - so that that column can uniquely
25:20 - identify a table
25:22 - so id are unique for all the employees
25:26 - so i choose id as my primary key
25:32 - so right column
25:37 - and primary key
25:42 - then id name of the column that
25:46 - you want to set as primary key
25:49 - brackets close okay our table is created
25:55 - so how we can save it this table
25:59 - so write backslash
26:04 - here you can see employee table is
26:07 - created
26:09 - here you can also see this is called
26:11 - schema
26:12 - which is public we will discuss more
26:15 - about schema
26:16 - in our later videos so stay tuned for
26:18 - that
26:20 - now if we want to know the
26:23 - structure of our table then simply write
26:26 - backslash the
26:30 - name of the table
26:36 - here you can see our employee table has
26:38 - two column
26:39 - name and id and this is the respective
26:42 - data types integer and
26:48 - so close this
26:52 - now we can start with
26:55 - each admin okay
27:00 - now just refresh it
27:07 - in text in schema
27:11 - in public schema tables
27:15 - this is the table employee so
27:18 - let us create one more table in this
27:21 - test
27:23 - database so another query tool
27:28 - create table
27:32 - now name of the table let's say student
27:37 - restaurant has roll number
27:46 - and
27:50 - the data type of this role number will
27:53 - be
27:53 - in it and a student also has
27:58 - name name
28:02 - can be anywhere
28:09 - now roll number will be a primary key
28:28 - and
28:32 - execute just
28:35 - refresh here and you can see
28:40 - in tables
28:49 - we have student table okay
28:52 - here you can expand this and columns
28:55 - roll number
28:56 - and name now if you want to
29:00 - release this table then write
29:04 - draw table
29:07 - then name of the table
29:12 - just refresh it
29:15 - and you can see strong table has been
29:18 - deleted
29:21 - so this is how you can create a table
29:24 - and drop and in this video i will show
29:27 - you how to insert values
29:28 - in those tables so first of all open
29:32 - your
29:38 - terminal
29:43 - write psq
29:53 - here you can see we have test database
29:57 - we are going to use that and to connect
29:59 - this database
30:00 - write slash c and the name of the
30:04 - database
30:05 - now we are connected with
30:20 - the name of the table student
30:24 - brackets now specifying the columns
30:30 - roll number
30:37 - and the length is now the primary key
30:42 - and all these strands has unique roll
30:44 - number
30:45 - we will set row number as a primary key
30:55 - okay our table is created and let us see
31:00 - the table slash d and you can see
31:06 - okay so to insert data into
31:10 - this table
31:14 - into the name of the table
31:19 - then column names in which you want to
31:24 - insert the values
31:30 - then values here you can
31:34 - provide values
31:39 - [Music]
31:44 - now
31:49 - this is how you can insert values in the
31:52 - table
31:53 - okay so let's
31:57 - click the terminal
32:26 - okay so here we have
32:29 - test database
32:35 - let us try to insert some values
32:38 - in these tables
32:50 - okay here is one thing if we wanted to
32:54 - insert all the values for the
32:57 - all the values for all the columns it
33:00 - means that
33:01 - for every column you have an value
33:04 - which you wanted to you want to insert
33:07 - so in this case you don't need to write
33:10 - the column names
33:12 - you can directly start with the values
33:19 - values one zero two let's say
33:31 - okay one row is inserted
33:35 - this is how you can insert as many as
33:38 - value
33:38 - you want
33:44 - we can also insert multiple values in
33:47 - order to do that just put comma here
34:04 - let us change this value
34:12 - robot and you can see
34:15 - two values has been extensive so
34:19 - this is how you can insert the
34:22 - multiple values in the table and
34:25 - remember one thing whenever you
34:28 - specify the column names here like
34:32 - in this case number and name
34:37 - then you have to insert the
34:41 - values uh in respective order it means
34:44 - you
34:45 - if you write roll number first and roll
34:48 - number cup first
34:49 - and you write name second then roll then
34:52 - name
34:52 - common second okay so order is very
34:56 - important second programming knowledge
34:58 - in our previous video
34:59 - we saw that how to insert values in the
35:02 - table
35:03 - and in this video we will see how to
35:05 - fetch data from the table
35:07 - so first of all open the terminal or
35:09 - command prompt
35:17 - okay write psql
35:21 - okay so let us first see which are the
35:24 - databases present in our system
35:26 - for that use cell
35:30 - here you can see we have test database
35:32 - so
35:33 - we are going to use that
35:36 - slide c for connect and name of the
35:39 - database
35:40 - now we are connected to test database
35:43 - let us see which are the tables present
35:45 - in this database
35:47 - for that use backslash t and you can see
35:50 - we have student table here
35:53 - let's see which are the columns
35:55 - [Music]
35:57 - and you can see we have roll number and
35:59 - name roll number is integer and name is
36:01 - work here
36:03 - so let us try to insert some data
37:07 - fetch data from the table the command is
37:10 - select
37:12 - then name of the column you want to
37:14 - fetch
37:15 - let's say roll number and name
37:19 - from which table student table
37:30 - if you want to select all the columns
37:32 - present in
37:34 - your table then you don't require
37:37 - to write all the column names you can
37:39 - simply write
37:40 - select start
37:44 - from table student
37:48 - the result will be the same
37:52 - okay let's just with that
37:56 - open pg admin
38:21 - okay so in this database
38:25 - probably tables we have printable
38:34 - it is the same as command prompt
38:38 - select star
38:45 - and this is
38:49 - if you want name first and after that
38:52 - you want problem
38:53 - then you can also write name and then
38:57 - roll number okay so in this case the
39:00 - roll number will be dispenses
39:02 - the second column
39:05 - so this is how you can fix data from the
39:08 - table
39:09 - in this video we will see how to fetch
39:12 - distinct value from the table
39:15 - so let us first open terminal
39:24 - write psql
39:29 - okay so let us first see which are the
39:32 - databases present in our system
39:36 - here you can see we have test database
39:40 - so let me connect to it
39:44 - let's see
39:49 - and this is the table
39:53 - let us try to insert some more value in
39:56 - that table
40:00 - insert into
40:03 - student
40:07 - values let's say 110
40:22 - but
40:28 - again robot
40:32 - it is possible that two students have
40:34 - the same name
40:39 - okay three values has been inserted
40:42 - so let us see the data
40:45 - select
40:50 - from student and you can see so
40:54 - one thing you can notice from here is
40:56 - region
40:58 - come twice and robert
41:01 - comes thrice so there are multiple
41:05 - entities
41:06 - in these tables and when you
41:09 - use normal select star from student
41:13 - you get redundant value okay so
41:17 - if you do not want the redundant value
41:19 - and you want only unique value
41:22 - which is distinct value from the table
41:25 - then you can use distinct keyword
41:28 - you can use the distinct
41:33 - then the name of the column
41:36 - name select distinct name from
41:42 - student here you can see
41:45 - you can only get the values which are
41:48 - unique
41:49 - and only one time natasha lilly wrote
41:52 - him any robot
41:53 - bridging in previous
41:56 - result bridging comes twice but
41:59 - in this reason region comes only one
42:01 - time
42:02 - and robot only one so
42:05 - this is how we can select distinct value
42:08 - so
42:09 - let's quit the terminal and open our pc
42:14 - admin
42:18 - here also we have student table
42:25 - okay select
42:28 - start from
42:31 - student and you can see multiple
42:34 - entities
42:36 - and as we done in the terminal you can
42:38 - only need to write distinct
42:40 - keyword
42:43 - listing name
42:47 - and you can get a distinct values so
42:50 - this is how we can
42:52 - use distinct keyword to get unique
42:54 - values from the table
42:56 - in this video we will see how to use
42:59 - where clause with select statement
43:02 - so in our previous video we saw that how
43:04 - to use select statement to face data
43:06 - from the table
43:07 - and in this video we use very close with
43:10 - it
43:10 - so
43:20 - now let us see which are the databases
43:23 - present in our system
43:26 - so here we have test database
43:29 - for connect to this database let's see
43:33 - test and
43:36 - we have student table so we write select
43:41 - let's say we only want roll number
43:50 - so here you can see we get 10 rows
43:53 - because the table has only 10 rows
43:57 - and you can notice one thing um
44:00 - we can picturize this and the columns
44:04 - in this statement whether we use roll
44:08 - number
44:09 - one if we use name instead of roll
44:12 - number
44:16 - even after that we get only 10 rows
44:19 - and in the previous season we get 10
44:21 - rules so
44:22 - in previous results we get roll number
44:24 - because we filter the column with
44:27 - roll number and in the second segment we
44:29 - filter the statement
44:30 - with name column so
44:34 - what if we want to filter the rows
44:38 - also we do not want all zeroes
44:42 - i own the student whose role number is
44:45 - one zero five let's say
44:48 - so in this condition we can use
44:52 - where so right select
44:58 - let's say star
45:02 - from student where
45:05 - now here we can specify our connection
45:08 - so we want to filter on the role so
45:14 - is equal to let's say 105.
45:18 - here you can see we get only one row
45:21 - because there is only one student
45:23 - who has roll number one zero five
45:27 - so this is how you can filter the rows
45:30 - with the help of
45:31 - where clause so let me just quit
45:35 - proper pg admin
45:40 - okay so here we can also use the same
45:44 - statement
45:56 - [Music]
46:12 - name
46:15 - is equal to let's say robert
46:21 - we get two values three values sorry
46:25 - because robot comes three times
46:29 - and these are the roll numbers
46:32 - you can also filter the column
46:36 - as i teach you earlier
46:39 - let's say select
46:44 - roll number function where name is equal
46:46 - to robot
46:48 - so this is how you can filter the rows
46:51 - as well as columns in this video we will
46:54 - see how to use and operator
46:57 - to join multiple condition in our sql
46:59 - statement so
47:00 - first of all to open your terminal
47:06 - write psql
47:10 - now let us see which are the databases
47:12 - present
47:13 - in our system so
47:16 - we use test database
47:20 - type c and the name of the database
47:26 - and it happened that we are going to use
47:29 - this
47:29 - runtime so let me show you
47:34 - what student table is actually
47:42 - here you can see it has two columns
47:47 - so let me write a simple selection
47:55 - okay so it has 10 rows
47:59 - and if i want to filter it with the
48:03 - rows and we can
48:14 - is greater than one zero
48:18 - five so
48:21 - here you can notice one thing that after
48:24 - where close i provide the condition roll
48:27 - number greater than one zero five this
48:29 - is the condition
48:31 - and there is only one condition but in
48:33 - real life in real scenarios
48:35 - there may have multiple condition so
48:38 - if you want to join the condition which
48:41 - are
48:41 - more than two then you can use and
48:44 - operator
48:47 - we can use like and
48:51 - and specify the another condition let's
48:54 - say
48:54 - number greater than 05 but
48:59 - less than
49:04 - one million here you can see the roll
49:08 - number is between one zero five
49:09 - and triple one so
49:13 - this whole condition will be true if
49:16 - both the condition will be true
49:20 - if even one of them is not true then the
49:23 - whole condition becomes false
49:27 - let's say
49:43 - okay so we specify
49:46 - a robot here
49:51 - okay so both have probably number
49:54 - greater than one zero five and the name
49:56 - is now if i
49:59 - write
50:05 - equal to let's say 145
50:09 - and name is equal to robert
50:13 - this condition is true but this
50:16 - condition is false
50:17 - so the whole condition become false so
50:19 - we will get nothing
50:23 - yeah you can see so
50:26 - let me just close the terminal
50:29 - and open pg admin
50:33 - test database and require tool
50:37 - so this
50:49 - let's say name is equal to
51:03 - greater than one
51:10 - so you can see both the conditions
51:12 - satisfied
51:13 - that's why the whole condition becomes
51:15 - true and we get the result
51:17 - if one of them will be false
51:20 - let's say
51:24 - and we get nothing
51:27 - so this is how you can join multiple
51:29 - condition using
51:30 - end operator in this video we will see
51:33 - how we can use
51:34 - our operator to join multiple conditions
51:36 - in sql queries
51:38 - so first of all open your terminal
51:43 - write psql
51:46 - now let us see which are the databases
51:48 - present in our system
51:51 - so we have this test database so we are
51:54 - going to use that one only
51:56 - let's see for connecting
52:00 - and we have student table
52:04 - in our previous video we saw that how we
52:06 - can use
52:07 - and operator to join multiple queries so
52:11 - this time we are going to use our
52:13 - operator
52:14 - there is only one simple difference
52:17 - between and
52:18 - and our operator in our operator
52:21 - if we want that all statement will
52:24 - become true
52:25 - that it is not necessary
52:28 - that every condition that you
52:31 - write into sql query have to become true
52:34 - if any one of them become true then all
52:37 - conditions become true
52:39 - let me say select start
52:42 - from student
52:53 - is greater than let's say
52:56 - 20 and i'm using
52:59 - here and name is equal to pj
53:05 - and we get nothing because
53:08 - region name is present but roll
53:11 - number greater than 220 is not present
53:13 - in our table
53:15 - so in order to
53:19 - in order to satisfy this whole condition
53:22 - both individual condition
53:23 - must be true because we write end
53:25 - operator
53:27 - let us see if we change this with or
53:30 - then what will happen
53:35 - here you can see we get to those because
53:38 - in order to
53:40 - satisfy this whole condition if any of
53:43 - them
53:44 - is true then this whole condition
53:46 - becomes true
53:48 - so this is the difference between n and
53:51 - or operator
53:53 - so let me just create it
54:02 - okay so let me write a simple query
54:07 - select with lego number here
54:10 - [Music]
54:21 - let's say name is equal to
54:26 - vision
54:29 - name is equal to
54:33 - robot
54:36 - here we can see which income twice
54:39 - in the table and robot comprised so
54:41 - there are total
54:42 - five zero that we will get
54:47 - i can write star here and you can see
54:55 - so this is how you can use all operator
54:58 - to join multiple condition in your skill
55:02 - pace
55:03 - in this video we will see how you can
55:06 - use
55:06 - order by close in your sql carries so
55:09 - first of all open your terminal
55:20 - write psql
55:23 - now let us see which are the databases
55:26 - present number system
55:28 - so we are going to use the test database
55:34 - let's see for connect and test it
55:38 - and this is the table we have student
55:40 - table
55:41 - and it has roll number and
55:47 - so let us see the data
55:55 - so we see data and was present in our
55:58 - table
55:59 - now what is the use of order by close
56:03 - from the name suggest itself order by
56:06 - clause is used
56:08 - to order your result in ascending or
56:11 - descending order
56:13 - so how to write it select
56:17 - from in order by
56:23 - then the name of the column by which you
56:25 - want to order the result
56:27 - let's say name i won't the result
56:31 - to be ordered by name and you can see
56:35 - region come first then himani lili it is
56:38 - in alphabetical order
56:40 - so by default when you didn't provide
56:43 - any ascending or dis descending
56:47 - uh keyboard uh it will uh
56:51 - order the result by ascending order
56:55 - if you want it to descend link order
56:59 - you can write the esc
57:06 - and you can see now it is in descending
57:09 - order in alphabetical
57:11 - you can also order it by the roll number
57:20 - here you can see it is in ascending
57:22 - order
57:24 - so let me just create it and open
57:28 - pg admin
57:32 - okay in databases test and
57:36 - tables and clickbait
57:40 - okay so let me first create a new table
57:43 - this time
57:46 - create table let's say employee
57:54 - it has employee id
57:59 - and the data type will be
58:05 - name name of the employee
58:10 - where 10
58:14 - and empid will be our primary key
58:35 - so our table is created
58:39 - now insert some data
58:47 - let's say one two three
59:19 - okay has been certain right
59:33 - so we have these three reports so i want
59:37 - to
59:37 - order it by the employee id then i write
59:42 - order by
59:46 - and you can see it is in ascending order
59:50 - if i provide keyword pse
59:54 - then it will be descending we can also
59:57 - order it by the employee name
60:03 - and you can see you name going let's see
60:09 - so this is how you can use order by
60:11 - clause in your sql queries
60:13 - in this video we will see how we can use
60:16 - limit class in our sql queries
60:19 - so first of all open your terminal
60:23 - write psql
60:27 - so let us see which are the databases
60:29 - present our system
60:32 - so we have this many of databases and we
60:34 - are going to use this one
60:36 - test so for connecting to test database
60:39 - right
60:40 - let's see
60:50 - okay so now we are connected to test
60:53 - database
60:54 - and we have two tables
60:57 - employable and storage table so
61:01 - what is the use of limit clause actually
61:03 - um
61:04 - let me first show you
61:08 - let's start
61:15 - and it is displaying that 10 rows so one
61:18 - thing
61:18 - that you can notice from here whenever
61:21 - we are using this type
61:23 - of select statement
61:26 - the result will contain all the rows
61:28 - that are present in our table
61:30 - it's showing all the rows but what if
61:34 - we don't want all the data i want only
61:37 - first five rows or only seven rows or
61:40 - only three rows
61:42 - so how to set a limit for that so in
61:45 - order to set a limit
61:46 - we are going to use that limit keyword
61:50 - right select from
61:55 - student and second limit now how many
61:59 - rows do i want let's say i want only
62:02 - three rows
62:03 - then i write three and
62:07 - it will show me only three rows
62:12 - if i want nine rows i don't want the
62:16 - last row
62:17 - then it will show me nine rows it will
62:20 - not show me this one
62:21 - last one okay
62:25 - so let me just create it and open pg
62:27 - admin
62:32 - okay so
62:36 - let's employ
62:40 - we have three rows only here and i want
62:44 - only
62:44 - one row
62:48 - yes and one more thing you can also use
62:51 - expression here like
62:54 - employable doesn't have many data so let
62:57 - me use total table
63:00 - limit to let's say 2
63:03 - into 3 minus 1 and that will be 5
63:08 - and you can see
63:13 - what if it goes to minus and still
63:17 - um i think the
63:20 - plus and negative marking does not
63:22 - affect this
63:23 - okay so let me write four
63:27 - plus three
63:33 - and you can see we get seven rows
63:36 - so this is how we can use limit clause
63:39 - in
63:39 - sqlite in this video we will see how to
63:42 - update the table means how to modify the
63:46 - data which are already present in
63:47 - the table so first of all open your
63:50 - terminal
63:53 - write psql
63:58 - okay so let us see which are the
64:00 - databases present in our system
64:02 - next lesson and we are going to use
64:07 - test database for that let's see for
64:10 - connecting and name of the database
64:14 - so we have two tables employee and
64:17 - student
64:19 - let us see the data of this one table
64:27 - okay so we have 10 rules so
64:31 - what if the scenario where
64:34 - i want to change the name of the student
64:37 - whose role number is 103
64:40 - currently the name is rock and i want to
64:44 - change it to diana let's say so
64:48 - for updating table the query is updated
64:54 - the name of the table whose data you
64:56 - want to modify
64:58 - in this case it is student
65:02 - now the new value you want to insert
65:06 - that for which column name of the column
65:09 - is name
65:10 - is equal to lyanna
65:14 - now where this diana will appear
65:18 - it will appear here whose role number is
65:29 - update one let us see the data
65:34 - and here you can see
65:37 - one zero three let us set it
65:40 - order by
65:45 - problem okay here you can see one zero
65:49 - three it has been changed to diana
65:52 - from rock so this is how you can update
65:56 - table
65:57 - you can also use multiple condition
66:00 - in like update
66:06 - sorry update
66:11 - student set
66:17 - name is equal to
66:20 - let's say
66:25 - where roll number
66:37 - will change we write r
66:44 - and this will update two rows first of
66:47 - all this rows
66:49 - and the second one is this
66:55 - so you can see
67:00 - brian here and brandon
67:03 - so this is how you can use update so let
67:06 - me just close
67:07 - this opportunity
67:17 - [Music]
67:23 - okay we have only three rows so i want
67:26 - to change the
67:28 - employee id of the employee whose name
67:31 - is bruce
67:32 - okay so update
67:38 - employee set
67:42 - [Music]
67:48 - where name is equal to
67:54 - rules
67:56 - sorry name
68:00 - it updates it updated
68:04 - let us see
68:12 - okay it is updated so
68:16 - this is how you can modify the data
68:18 - present in your table using
68:20 - update method in this video we will see
68:22 - how we can delete
68:24 - data from the table in postgresql
68:29 - once you've inserted the data into your
68:31 - table
68:32 - there will be time when you need to
68:35 - delete
68:35 - those data from this table the reason
68:39 - can be
68:40 - you don't need that data anymore or you
68:43 - wanted to make some space on your server
68:46 - etc etc so before going into execution
68:51 - let us first see what is the syntax
68:54 - for that so
68:59 - let me just show you the syntax
69:03 - so the syntax is delete
69:08 - because we want to delete data from the
69:10 - table
69:12 - then we have to specify the name of the
69:15 - table
69:16 - from which we want to delete the data
69:18 - delete
69:19 - from then you can provide
69:23 - table name
69:27 - then where after that you can
69:31 - provide your condition
69:37 - column name is equal to
69:42 - value so this is the syntax
69:46 - for deleting rows from the table
69:51 - the delete keyword then specify the name
69:54 - of the table
69:55 - and after that you can give the
69:58 - condition
69:59 - so all the rows which matches with this
70:03 - condition
70:04 - will be deleted let us see an example
70:10 - open your terminal
70:14 - write psql
70:19 - now let us see which are the databases
70:22 - present in our system
70:23 - for that write backslide
70:28 - as you can see we have various databases
70:30 - here
70:31 - and among them we are going to use this
70:34 - test database
70:37 - so for connecting to the test database
70:41 - please write backs let's see for connect
70:44 - and then name of the database
70:48 - now we are connected to test database
70:51 - now let us see which are the tables
70:53 - present in
70:54 - text database for that write backslash d
71:00 - as you can see we have employee table
71:03 - and student table so let us see
71:07 - the structure of this one table
71:11 - so and then
71:14 - name of the table so the student table
71:18 - have two columns
71:20 - roll number and name and roll number
71:24 - is the primary key for this storage
71:26 - table
71:28 - let us see the data present in stone
71:31 - tables
71:38 - namely
71:41 - we have 10 rows and
71:44 - this is the row number and the name
71:48 - so let us assume that
71:52 - i want to delete the
71:55 - row where student have the name
71:58 - bridging okay i want to delete this rows
72:02 - from this table
72:06 - so
72:10 - then provide the name of the table from
72:12 - which you want to delete the data
72:15 - so in this case the name will be used
72:26 - [Music]
72:31 - again delete the name of the table
72:35 - and then the condition
72:38 - which delete this row
72:43 - press enter delete one
72:47 - this number indicate how many rows
72:50 - was deleted one row has been deleted
72:53 - so we can say select star from
73:02 - student
73:07 - you can see this row
73:11 - is no longer part of the student table
73:14 - so this is how you can delete data from
73:17 - your table
73:18 - now we can also delete multiple
73:21 - rows from the table if the condition we
73:24 - specify
73:25 - matches with multiple rows then multiple
73:28 - rows will be deleted
73:30 - this time we are going to use employee
73:32 - table
73:33 - so let us first see the data from the
73:36 - employee
73:41 - so it has only three rows
73:44 - bridging net and groups and two columns
73:47 - employee id and employment
73:49 - now i want to delete the employee
73:52 - whose employee id is
73:56 - 124 and
73:59 - employee name is equal to bridging
74:03 - okay so delete
74:07 - from then we are specifying the name of
74:11 - the table
74:15 - where condition
74:20 - id is equal to one to four
74:25 - [Music]
74:26 - or
74:28 - if you notice this i am using or here
74:30 - because if i use
74:32 - end operator then there is
74:35 - no row that satisfy the condition
74:38 - because
74:39 - one two four has
74:55 - and two rows will be deleted here you
74:58 - can see
74:59 - so let us first see data
75:03 - and you can see
75:06 - so just close the terminal
75:10 - and open pg admin here
75:15 - databases we have test database in
75:22 - public
75:26 - okay let us first see the data from the
75:36 - employee
75:40 - it has only one row so
75:44 - what i'm trying to say is if you do not
75:47 - specify any condition
75:49 - while deleting rows
75:52 - like this delete
75:56 - from
76:00 - that's it you do not specify any
76:03 - condition here
76:04 - then all the rows will be deleted it
76:07 - means all the data
76:08 - which you have stored in your table will
76:10 - be deleted
76:12 - so be careful while you are writing this
76:13 - query
76:15 - i am showing you
76:19 - since our table has only one row one row
76:21 - is deleted
76:24 - you can see say
76:27 - from
76:32 - employee
76:34 - our table is empty now
76:37 - so this is how you can delete single
76:40 - rows multiple rows with the
76:42 - statement in this video we will see how
76:45 - we can
76:45 - delete or drop a table in postgresql
76:50 - in our previous video we saw that how to
76:52 - delete data preserving
76:54 - table and in this video we will see how
76:58 - we can delete
76:58 - entire table so before going into
77:01 - execution
77:03 - let us first understand the syntax
77:09 - okay to delete or drop the table the
77:13 - syntax is
77:14 - drop in table
77:18 - the name of the table which you want to
77:21 - delete
77:26 - and that's it it's pretty much easy
77:30 - so again first of all you specify
77:33 - drop keyword because you want to drop a
77:35 - table
77:37 - then you want to drop a table that's why
77:40 - you are writing table here
77:42 - and the name of the table of course
77:46 - so let us open the terminal
77:55 - write psql
77:59 - now let us see which are the databases
78:01 - present in our system
78:03 - for that right backslash l
78:07 - here we have test database so we are
78:09 - going to use that one
78:15 - for using that test database
78:18 - i write backslash c for connecting and
78:21 - text
78:24 - now we are connected to press database
78:26 - now let us see which are
78:28 - the tables present in our test database
78:31 - for that right basis
78:34 - we have two tables first one is employee
78:37 - and second one is one now
78:41 - i'm going to create a new table because
78:44 - i don't want to delete these tables
78:47 - so let me just create another table
78:50 - okay create table
78:54 - then name of the table we will write let
78:56 - us see
78:57 - this time let us say
79:01 - animal okay
79:05 - and specify the column name
79:09 - so the first column will be name
79:14 - data type will be where
79:21 - name of the animal and
79:25 - let us see color of the animal
79:31 - okay and i specify
79:42 - sorry
79:47 - let us see it
79:51 - and the
79:54 - paid id
79:58 - which will be input
80:02 - and paid addict into our primary key
80:16 - so our table is created let us see this
80:19 - table
80:22 - and this is the table let us see this
80:25 - structure
80:28 - okay so name color
80:34 - now i want to delete this table i've
80:38 - created
80:38 - a new table which is animal and now i
80:41 - want to delete means drop detail
80:45 - so as we learn right drop
80:49 - table the name of the table
80:56 - that's it and it will drop the table
81:01 - let us see as you can see animal is not
81:04 - listed here it means
81:06 - it is deleted you can also delete
81:09 - multiple table at once so
81:12 - for that let me just create two
81:16 - temporary table okay
81:20 - create table then
81:23 - name of the table let's say
81:27 - d1 because
81:30 - uh later i'm going to delete it okay
81:34 - i write id and
81:38 - in and make it a primary key
81:49 - okay again let me create
81:54 - table with the name of p2 and rest will
81:56 - be the same
81:59 - let us see okay so we have
82:02 - two tables d1 and d2 and now i want to
82:05 - delete
82:06 - two table segments so right drop
82:11 - table then name of the table
82:15 - d1
82:18 - comma entity and our table is
82:23 - as you can see we deleted multiple table
82:26 - in one statement
82:30 - so open your pgaming
82:38 - okay in test and query tool
82:41 - okay so let us first
82:45 - create new tables
82:51 - name of twitter will be the same given
83:08 - okay our table is created
83:14 - now to see just right click and refresh
83:19 - and you can see d1 columns
83:23 - we have id column okay so to drop
83:27 - a table this syntax will be the same
83:29 - drop
83:32 - table the name of the table which is
83:35 - d1 in this case
83:39 - and table is deleted so
83:43 - just right click and refresh and you can
83:45 - see
83:46 - d1 is no longer part of the tables
83:50 - um just be careful while using this
83:53 - query because
83:55 - once you delete the table you cannot
83:58 - restore the data which was
84:00 - present in those table so
84:04 - be careful while performing this type of
84:06 - way
84:07 - in this video we will see how we can
84:09 - delete
84:10 - all the data from the table in our
84:13 - previous video
84:14 - we saw that how we can drop the table
84:16 - and in this video
84:18 - we will see if you want to truncate your
84:21 - table
84:21 - then how you can do it so
84:24 - let us first understand the syntax so
84:34 - okay so the syntax is
84:37 - pretty obvious truncate
84:41 - because you want to truncate then
84:44 - table and
84:48 - name of the table
84:51 - that you want to truncate and that's it
84:54 - it is syntax now
84:58 - lots of people asking that
85:01 - if they can use delete query to truncate
85:05 - the table
85:06 - and my answer is
85:10 - yes you can use the delete statement but
85:14 - the work that both the command is doing
85:17 - is pretty much the same but the approach
85:20 - they are taking
85:21 - is different if i talk about delete
85:25 - query
85:26 - then delete statement first scan the
85:29 - entire table
85:31 - and then delete each row one by one
85:35 - if we talk about truncate then it will
85:39 - delete the entire table first it means
85:41 - all the rows will be gone
85:43 - and then recreate it recreate the table
85:46 - with the same schema
85:49 - so if you are working with small table
85:52 - it means that your table doesn't have
85:55 - that many of
85:56 - rows then it
85:59 - doesn't affect that much if you are
86:01 - using truncate or delete statement
86:05 - but if you are dealing with large amount
86:07 - of data
86:09 - let's say your table contains millions
86:11 - of rows
86:13 - then using delete statement
86:16 - will be more costlier than truncate
86:18 - statement
86:20 - it puts lots of pressure on this server
86:23 - and it requires a lot of time
86:26 - if i compare it to the truncate so it's
86:29 - better to use truncate table
86:32 - in order to delete all the data present
86:35 - in the table
86:37 - so this is the syntax and
86:41 - let us first open the terminal
86:49 - okay so write psql
86:54 - now let us see which are the databases
86:56 - present in our system
86:59 - for that use backslash l
87:03 - okay so we have test database so we are
87:06 - going to use that
87:07 - for connecting it right let's let's see
87:10 - name of it now we are connected to test
87:14 - database
87:16 - now let us see which are the tables
87:19 - present in test database
87:21 - so we have employable and school table
87:27 - let us see the data present student
87:30 - level
87:30 - select
87:32 - [Music]
87:34 - basic select statement
87:38 - and it has a no rose okay
87:41 - it is empty so let us first insert some
87:44 - values in this table
87:47 - insert into
87:51 - values so it has
87:55 - id and name
88:04 - we can set multiple values
88:40 - okay
88:46 - okay i forgot to specify the
88:50 - name of the table insert into student
88:55 - okay so four rows has been inserted
89:00 - let us
89:12 - okay so this is for data now i want to
89:15 - delete
89:15 - all the rows all the data present in
89:17 - this table
89:18 - so we are going to use that token
89:20 - command
89:22 - okay
89:25 - and name of the table
89:38 - this file truncate table
89:42 - is executed let us see if
89:45 - table is present or not that sd
90:00 - as you can see it is empty
90:03 - so this is how you can use truncate
90:06 - command
90:07 - to truncate your table so close your
90:10 - terminal
90:13 - open pgm
90:14 - [Music]
90:18 - test
90:21 - okay okay so this time we are going to
90:24 - use
90:25 - employee table so let us see which are
90:27 - the data present in pivotable
90:36 - sorry for that
90:41 - okay so it is also empty so let us press
90:44 - insert some value
90:52 - employee
90:55 - [Music]
90:57 - values it has is
91:22 - [Music]
91:29 - okay three row has been inserted
91:33 - now okay
91:37 - the command will be say truncate
91:41 - the name of the table that you want to
91:42 - track it this time
91:44 - employee
91:50 - so table is truncated let us see
92:02 - as you can see so
92:05 - this is how you can truncate your table
92:08 - to delete
92:09 - all the data present in the table in
92:11 - this video we will see
92:13 - how you can modify or alter your table
92:16 - once you have created friends there
92:20 - may be some scenarios where once you
92:23 - have created your table
92:25 - after some time you need to do some
92:27 - modification
92:29 - so how you can perform those type of
92:31 - queries
92:32 - in postgresql let us first understand
92:36 - understand the syntax
92:38 - okay
92:44 - okay so there are various tasks that you
92:47 - can perform with
92:48 - single elder query first of all you can
92:52 - add a new column
92:58 - then you can drop a column
93:04 - and you can also modify
93:11 - the data type
93:14 - of the column
93:19 - okay so first let us understand
93:22 - how to add any column the syntax is
93:27 - alter
93:35 - table then
93:38 - name of the table
93:41 - [Music]
93:45 - then add because you want to add
93:47 - something
93:48 - then name of the column
93:52 - column name
93:56 - and the data type
94:02 - that's it it is same syntax first of all
94:06 - you need to write alter because you want
94:07 - to modify
94:09 - some changes then table
94:12 - then you specify the name of the table
94:15 - then add because you want to add
94:16 - something
94:19 - and the column name that you want to add
94:20 - and the data type of that code
94:23 - so let's open pc admin
94:29 - we have database test database
94:32 - okay so
94:36 - now let us add
94:39 - some column in our existing table
94:42 - here you can see we have employable and
94:45 - student table
94:47 - in student table we have only two
94:49 - columns roll number and name
94:51 - so let us add a new column
94:54 - last name instrument table so
94:58 - alter because we want to alter the
95:00 - existing table
95:02 - table name of the table
95:08 - now we want to add something
95:12 - and the name of the column
95:17 - now i want to store only the initial
95:20 - only the first alphabet of the surname
95:23 - so
95:24 - our data type will be k okay
95:33 - so very different successfully
95:36 - okay so just you need to right click on
95:39 - the table
95:40 - and refresh
95:45 - and we have a name here you can see
95:49 - roll number name and
95:52 - so this is how you can add a new column
95:55 - to existing table
95:58 - also let us try to add a new following
96:01 - application as well
96:03 - okay so in empty we have employee id
96:07 - and employee name so
96:11 - let us add a salary column okay
96:16 - syntax will be the same editor table
96:21 - then name of the table this time we want
96:23 - to add something in employee
96:25 - so employee
96:29 - then add
96:33 - name of the column
96:37 - and the data that will be okay okay
96:41 - alter table name of the table in this
96:45 - case
96:46 - it will be employee we want to add
96:48 - something that's why we write add here
96:51 - name of the new column that we want to
96:53 - add salary
96:54 - and the data type will be okay
96:59 - so what very successfully return just
97:01 - rightly
97:02 - refresh and you can see salary is there
97:07 - okay so this is how you can add
97:11 - new columns to elder query
97:16 - so now come to the drop
97:20 - now we can only in we can not only
97:24 - add an equal we can also drop an
97:26 - existing column
97:28 - the syntax is very similar
97:34 - table a table name
97:43 - now this time we want to drop something
97:45 - so right drop
97:49 - then we specify the column
97:53 - that we want to drop
98:01 - and that's it alter
98:04 - table name of the table drop because we
98:07 - want to drop or delete something
98:09 - and the name of the column we want to
98:10 - delete
98:13 - okay open pga mean
98:16 - now let us try to remove this salary
98:20 - from the employee okay
98:23 - so alter
98:28 - table now
98:31 - the name of the table
98:36 - drop and the
98:40 - column which will be salary again
98:45 - alter table because you want to modify
98:47 - or alter the table
98:49 - then specify the name of the table then
98:51 - drop
98:52 - and this value okay f5
98:56 - query written successfully just right
98:58 - click on that and refresh
99:00 - and you can see cell will be gone
99:05 - let us see one more example try to
99:08 - remove
99:09 - this alien okay alter
99:14 - table name of the table will be used
99:17 - this time
99:18 - from okay
99:23 - just right click on
99:28 - and you can see roll number and name
99:30 - only okay
99:32 - so this is how we can drop a column
99:36 - now let us come to the last point
99:40 - which is modify the data type of the
99:42 - column
99:44 - okay so alter
99:49 - table name of the table
99:57 - now we want to modify alter
100:01 - again now which column we want to modify
100:08 - column name
100:11 - type type is the keyword
100:15 - and the new data type
100:22 - let me type new data type here so that
100:25 - you
100:26 - will not confuse new data type okay
100:29 - alter table name of the table
100:33 - then again alter the name of the column
100:36 - you want to modify
100:37 - type because they want to modify the
100:39 - data type and your data type
100:42 - open pc admin again
100:46 - let us first of all i do not want to
100:49 - mess up with
100:50 - my existing column so let me insert a
100:53 - new column
100:54 - then later on we will change the data
100:57 - type okay so
100:58 - student table enter
101:03 - table name of the table
101:09 - then again alter
101:15 - sorry first we want to add
101:19 - now we will add a name
101:22 - and okay
101:25 - just like click refresh and you can see
101:29 - now we will change the data type so
101:32 - replace
101:33 - add with alter
101:37 - alter column name l name
101:41 - right and now i change my mind i want
101:46 - to store entire surname
101:51 - instead of initials okay
101:54 - so right back that's a length of that
102:01 - and our query written successfully
102:05 - just refresh and
102:08 - right click over here and go to
102:10 - properties
102:12 - in definition and you can see character
102:15 - varying
102:15 - length of 10 its change
102:20 - again let us see one more example this
102:23 - time
102:24 - employee okay
102:28 - we have id and name let us
102:31 - try to insert
102:35 - a new column which will be
102:38 - middle name okay
102:54 - okay
102:57 - refresh let me show you the properties
103:00 - first of all
103:02 - and it is character option okay
103:07 - now i want to alter
103:12 - now can be the time
103:19 - okay but it didn't successfully
103:25 - we refresh here
103:29 - m name go to properties definition and
103:32 - you can see
103:33 - data type is changed to worker of the
103:36 - seventh
103:38 - so this is how you can use alter query
103:40 - to perform various tasks
103:42 - in postgresql in this video we will see
103:45 - how we can select in between ranges
103:50 - with the help of between operator okay
103:55 - so let us first open the terminal
104:01 - write psql
104:04 - now let us see which are the databases
104:07 - present in our system
104:08 - for that right backslash
104:13 - so here we have this test database so
104:17 - we are just going to use test test
104:19 - database
104:20 - so for connecting to test database
104:24 - write backslash c formatting
104:28 - test now we are connected
104:31 - to test database
104:35 - let us see which are the tables present
104:38 - in our system
104:42 - we have two tables under the
104:45 - test database first one is employee
104:49 - second one is student
105:00 - structure
105:06 - let us see which are the data present in
105:08 - our system
105:17 - okay so table is empty so let us first
105:21 - insert some values
106:16 - okay that's it we have inserted five
106:19 - rows
106:20 - let us see that okay so here we have
106:23 - five
106:24 - now i want to find out these students
106:28 - whose role number lies between one zero
106:31 - one
106:32 - and one zero three okay so
106:35 - how do we do it we write select
106:39 - [Music]
106:48 - greater than or equal to 1
106:52 - and
106:55 - total number less than or equal to
106:58 - one year right
107:04 - so we get these three rows
107:09 - now this condition roll number
107:13 - greater than or equal to one zero one
107:15 - and roll number less than
107:17 - equal to one zero three now here we need
107:20 - to specify row number
107:22 - twice and this makes this condition so
107:25 - long
107:27 - so there is one keyword which you can
107:30 - use
107:31 - to sort this condition
107:35 - right select
107:39 - from student
107:43 - where roll number
107:47 - then right between is the keyboard
107:52 - one zero three and
107:56 - sorry one zero one and one zero three
108:01 - as you can see we do not need to specify
108:04 - a round number twice here
108:06 - just use between and give the values
108:12 - and result will be the same as the
108:14 - previous one
108:15 - as you can see
108:19 - so just close your terminal
108:22 - open pj admin
108:26 - okay so in test database here and
108:30 - very cool okay so
108:34 - let us see this time
108:38 - this time we will use employee table
108:44 - okay
108:54 - so it's empty so let us first insert
108:56 - some value
108:58 - insert
109:03 - employee
109:06 - values
109:12 - one
109:15 - mia
109:19 - to
109:26 - brad
109:41 - okay
109:45 - sorry and
109:53 - okay so we have inserted four rows
109:56 - let us see that
110:07 - okay so this is our data
110:11 - now first of all
110:14 - we use the condition
110:22 - where
110:24 - emp id
110:37 - greater than equal to one
110:41 - and here is therefore equal to three
110:47 - so you can see the result we have one
110:49 - two
110:50 - three and corresponding employee name
110:54 - okay so we can write this with the
110:57 - output between
111:00 - just remove that one
111:04 - p id
111:08 - between one and
111:11 - three and you can see result will be the
111:15 - same
111:16 - as the previous one so
111:19 - this is how you can use between
111:22 - keyword to search between ranges and
111:26 - note down one thing that you can only
111:28 - use
111:29 - numbers here you cannot use characters
111:32 - okay
111:33 - in this video we will see how we can use
111:36 - alias name for column basically it's a
111:39 - different
111:40 - name that we want to show to the output
111:43 - on the screen the actual name will not
111:46 - change
111:47 - it will change only the result
111:51 - in which column name is displayed okay
111:56 - so first of all let us understand the
112:00 - syntax
112:11 - okay so select
112:17 - then the column name
112:27 - then we write as
112:30 - and here comes the new name
112:36 - new column name
112:42 - from
112:47 - table okay so
112:51 - select column name the original column
112:54 - name
112:55 - as the new column that we want to
112:58 - display
112:58 - on the output from the table name
113:04 - and if you want to give alias name to
113:08 - multiple column
113:09 - that can also be done in poster sql
113:13 - you just need to write select
113:22 - column name one
113:25 - as
113:29 - new column name
113:34 - then comma for separating
113:41 - column name to
113:45 - and
113:51 - new column name
113:55 - and you can specify multiple columns
113:57 - here
113:59 - and at the end of it
114:03 - table name
114:08 - okay so this is how you can specify
114:10 - multiple columns for alias
114:12 - okay okay so open your terminal
114:20 - write psql
114:26 - let us see which are the databases
114:28 - present in our system
114:29 - for that right x l
114:34 - here as you can see we have test
114:36 - database
114:38 - so for connecting that test database
114:42 - right backslash c for connecting
114:44 - and name of the database test
114:47 - now we are connected to test database
114:51 - let us see which are the tables present
114:54 - in our
114:54 - test database so we have two tables here
114:58 - employee table and student table as you
115:00 - can see
115:03 - so let us see the structure of student
115:05 - table
115:06 - for that write backslash d
115:09 - then name of the table so
115:13 - student table contains two columns first
115:16 - one is roll number
115:18 - and let us
115:22 - select some data
115:30 - okay so here you can see
115:35 - it comes with the original column number
115:37 - roll number
115:38 - and now i want to display
115:42 - roll number as id i don't want to change
115:46 - the original
115:47 - column name but i want that whenever i
115:51 - fire this query the people who are going
115:53 - to see this result
115:55 - will get id comes here okay
116:01 - so we write select
116:05 - roll number is id
116:10 - we don't want to change the name front
116:14 - name of the table
116:18 - okay again select the original column
116:22 - name
116:22 - in this case it will be round number
116:26 - is id
116:31 - name because i want to display name
116:35 - also from the table okay
116:39 - as you can see the result will be the
116:42 - same
116:42 - except the column name roll number is
116:46 - replaced by this id
116:50 - if i again write star here
116:53 - instead of specifying column
116:57 - and you can see
117:05 - since the original name is not changed
117:08 - okay
117:13 - so just close the terminal and
117:16 - open pg admin
117:19 - and database test very good okay
117:25 - so this time we are going to use
117:26 - employee table so
117:28 - let us see the columns and data
117:40 - we have four rows and two columns
117:42 - basically
117:46 - let us change all the columns name this
117:48 - time
117:50 - select
117:53 - let's say select emp id as
117:57 - tid
118:01 - e name is
118:07 - employees from
118:15 - okay as you can see
118:19 - our emp id is replaced by eid
118:23 - and the e name is replaced by employees
118:27 - so let us try to understand the
118:31 - syntax second time okay first of all
118:34 - select
118:36 - then the original column name then s
118:40 - in the earliest name that you want to
118:41 - give t id
118:44 - the original column e name and its alias
118:47 - name is employees
118:49 - from the table okay
118:52 - and remember one thing it's very
118:54 - important that
118:56 - it doesn't affect the original column
118:58 - name it is
119:00 - just only for display purpose if i write
119:04 - select from
119:10 - then the original column name comes up
119:12 - okay employee id
119:14 - name so this is how you can give alias
119:18 - name
119:19 - to columns in this video we will see how
119:22 - we can specify
119:23 - multiple values in select statement
119:27 - so first of all open your terminal
119:34 - okay write ps given
119:40 - and now let us see which are the
119:44 - databases present in our system for that
119:47 - right
119:50 - here you can see we have test database
119:53 - so we are just going to use that
119:56 - for connecting the test database right
119:59 - gets let's see for connect and test
120:04 - now we are connected to test database so
120:07 - let us see now which are the tables
120:10 - present in this database
120:11 - for that backslash d
120:15 - we have employee table and student table
120:20 - so let us see the structure of student
120:22 - table first
120:26 - so we have roll number and name here
120:29 - and student
120:32 - table has the primary key
120:35 - role number okay so let us see the data
120:40 - present in splendid select star
120:44 - from student
120:49 - so we have five rows here
120:53 - so let us consider a scenario where
120:56 - i want the data of the student
121:00 - which has roll number of either 1 0 1
121:04 - 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so
121:08 - how you can write it okay so
121:12 - let us try the method which we
121:16 - learned earlier okay select
121:19 - start
121:47 - so we get these three rows because
121:50 - this trade student has roll number
121:53 - either one zero one
121:54 - or one zero three or one zero five but
121:58 - look at this condition it's
122:01 - unnecessarily long because we specify a
122:03 - roll number
122:04 - three times here so how we can get rid
122:08 - of this
122:10 - there's an elegant solution for that all
122:12 - right
122:13 - select start
122:16 - from
122:23 - [Music]
122:32 - [Music]
122:35 - okay so
122:38 - this looks more readable and it is much
122:42 - smaller than the previous one and the
122:46 - output will be the same
122:49 - it will gives us the data where student
122:52 - has roll number
122:53 - either one zero one or one zero three or
122:56 - one zero five
122:58 - so let us close the terminal
123:01 - and open pg admin in test database
123:05 - open query tool this time we will
123:10 - use employee table so employee table has
123:13 - two
123:14 - columns employee id and employee name so
123:17 - let us see the data select
123:20 - start from employee
123:25 - we have four rows here employee id
123:29 - is one two three four so i want to
123:32 - select the employees
123:34 - whose employee id are either one
123:37 - or four okay so we can write
123:41 - like employee where
123:46 - np id is equal to 1
123:51 - or pid is equal to 4.
123:56 - and you can see the output
124:00 - consists of two rows mia and
124:04 - okay we can write it in
124:08 - another matter
124:12 - where emp id
124:15 - we specify in keyword in
124:20 - and then we specify
124:23 - the output will be the same we got two
124:26 - rows
124:29 - yeah only so this is how we can use
124:33 - in keyword to specify multiple values in
124:36 - select query and you can specify
124:40 - as many as values as you want okay
124:43 - let us try one more example so that you
124:46 - can get
124:47 - clear idea about it so let us try this
124:50 - with
124:51 - another table a new table okay so
124:54 - create table
124:58 - name of the table will be let's say
125:00 - mobile
125:04 - first of all id of the mobile which will
125:06 - be
125:08 - company
125:13 - so let's say okay
125:18 - primary key
125:25 - will be id okay
125:30 - so whatever is created let us see
125:44 - let us insert some values
126:00 - id
126:14 - function
126:23 - [Music]
126:28 - okay
126:36 - one zero four
126:44 - so we have inserted four rows
126:48 - let us see the data select start
126:53 - from mobile
126:57 - okay here is our data
127:00 - now i want to select the
127:03 - mobile whose id is one zero one
127:07 - one zero three and one zero four i don't
127:09 - want this one zero two samsung
127:11 - okay so i write select
127:16 - start from
127:19 - mobile because mobile is the name of the
127:22 - table
127:24 - where id
127:28 - in then we specify the multiple values
127:33 - one zero one one zero three
127:40 - as you can see we have the data
127:44 - which has the id of one zero one
127:47 - or one zero three or one zero four
127:50 - we can also specify the one zero
127:53 - then we get all the data okay
127:57 - we can also specify the particular
127:59 - column
128:00 - i want only company
128:04 - as you can see so
128:08 - that's it this is how you can specify
128:11 - multiple values
128:12 - in order to find the data
128:16 - in this video we will see how we can use
128:19 - like operator in
128:20 - select statement and how we can use
128:23 - wildcard with it
128:24 - to improvise the condition okay
128:28 - so let us first understand the syntax
128:31 - and what are the valid cards
128:38 - okay so we are going to use like
128:40 - operator
128:42 - and basically we have total two
128:46 - wild cards
128:51 - the first one is
128:54 - percentage and the second one
128:58 - is underscore percentage
129:03 - and underscore are two wild cards that
129:06 - provides by sql so
129:10 - what are therefore okay
129:13 - basically percentage sign is
129:16 - indicates the multiple characters zero
129:20 - for
129:20 - multiple characters while the underscore
129:23 - represents
129:24 - only one character you can understand it
129:28 - much better if i show you
129:32 - an example okay
129:36 - let us open terminal
129:41 - write psql
129:46 - okay so let us see which are the
129:48 - databases present in our system
129:50 - for that write backslash l
129:55 - so here you can see we have test
129:57 - database
129:58 - for connecting that test database we are
130:00 - going to use
130:02 - backslash c for connecting and name of
130:04 - the database test
130:07 - so we are connected to test database now
130:09 - let us see which are the tables
130:11 - present in our system so we have
130:15 - employee table mobile table and student
130:18 - table
130:21 - let us first see which are the data
130:23 - present in our student table
130:27 - select star from
130:31 - student we have five rows
130:35 - roll number and name is the column
130:38 - now what if i want the student
130:42 - whose name start with character b
130:46 - okay so i will write
130:50 - like this select start
130:53 - from so that
130:57 - pair provide the column
131:01 - and we are going to use like copyright
131:04 - like
131:05 - and then we use wildcards okay
131:08 - like the first character must be
131:12 - alphabet b okay so i write
131:15 - b and the rest of the character
131:19 - can be anything so i want to specify
131:23 - the multiple character here so i write
131:25 - percentage
131:29 - okay semicolon and you can see
131:33 - there are total two students whose name
131:35 - starts with character b
131:37 - bridging and bow so we get
131:40 - two rows
131:43 - let us consider one more example
131:48 - i want to select the student
131:52 - whose first character can be
131:55 - anything but the last character must be
132:00 - a okay
132:03 - so first character can be anything
132:10 - and the last character will be a
132:15 - okay so last character must be a
132:18 - and the rest of the characters can be
132:21 - anything
132:23 - so we go to rose julia
132:26 - andrea let us try to
132:30 - use underscore operator
132:35 - now i want to find out the student
132:39 - whose name has only three characters
132:42 - okay
132:44 - only three characters so i write
132:49 - underscore that represent one character
132:51 - second underscore
132:53 - and third one represents three
132:54 - characters
132:56 - as you can see we are getting bob as the
132:59 - results because
133:00 - bob is the only star whose name consists
133:03 - of
133:04 - three characters only
133:07 - okay so this is how you can use
133:11 - wildcards with like operator so
133:14 - let me just close these and open pga me
133:21 - in test database very good
133:25 - okay so now we are considering the
133:28 - second table which is employable
133:39 - so it has basically four rows
133:45 - as you can see we are getting only one
133:47 - row because
133:48 - only this employee is satisfying the
133:53 - condition okay
133:56 - apart from the name or
134:00 - student name that has worker type of
134:03 - data
134:04 - we can also use like operator with
134:07 - integer data type
134:09 - okay so
134:12 - for that we are going to use run table
134:19 - so we have five rows now i want to
134:22 - select the student
134:26 - where roll number
134:30 - like
134:35 - let's say the
134:39 - first number can be anything but
134:42 - last number must be three
134:45 - okay so perceptions represent multiple
134:48 - numbers
134:49 - and the last digit is three
134:52 - so the last digit must be three
134:56 - now i cannot use these syntax
135:00 - it will give me an error as you can see
135:03 - because like operator is
135:06 - by default work with the text or work
135:09 - editor type
135:10 - so i have to
135:14 - explicitly type trust it with text
135:18 - and you can see the last digit is three
135:22 - and the rest of is can be anything
135:25 - i can also modify this the first
135:28 - digit must be one the middle can be
135:32 - anything
135:33 - and let me just write underscore okay
135:37 - as you can see
135:45 - so basically this is how you can use the
135:48 - file card with the like operator
135:50 - to improvise your search user in this
135:53 - video we will see
135:54 - how we can copy data from one table
135:57 - to another table so to perform this type
136:01 - of
136:02 - task we are going to use insert into
136:05 - select statement
136:07 - so there are few things that you must
136:09 - need to know before
136:11 - you're going into further that is
136:14 - when you are copying data from one table
136:17 - to another table
136:18 - the corresponding column data types must
136:21 - be the same
136:22 - that's obvious because you cannot copy
136:25 - and
136:26 - call down data which says data type of
136:28 - integer
136:29 - into the table in which the data type
136:32 - has
136:33 - worker or character so corresponding
136:36 - data type of the column must be the same
136:39 - so let us see the statement first
136:45 - okay so we are going to use insert
136:50 - into
136:51 - [Music]
136:54 - then the name of the table target table
136:56 - in which we want to insert the data
137:04 - and select from the source table
137:16 - here you can provide some condition if
137:18 - you want
137:23 - okay so again insert into target table
137:26 - in which you want to insert the data
137:29 - select start from source table from
137:32 - which you are going to copy the data
137:34 - and provide the condition if you want
137:36 - any okay
137:38 - so let us open terminal
137:44 - write psql
137:49 - now let us see which are the databases
137:51 - present in our system
137:53 - for that we are going to use backslash l
137:57 - here as you can see we have test
137:59 - database
138:01 - for connecting the test database we are
138:03 - going to use backslash c for connecting
138:05 - and then name of the database
138:08 - now we are connected to test database
138:10 - now let us see which are the tables
138:12 - present in our system backslash b
138:15 - so we have total three tables here
138:17 - employee mobile and student
138:20 - so let us see the structure of employee
138:22 - table
138:23 - back that's the name of the table
138:28 - so it has employee id and
138:31 - employee name integer data type and
138:34 - where okay
138:35 - now let us see these student structure
138:40 - as you can see corresponding data type
138:43 - are the same integer and okay so we can
138:47 - copy
138:48 - data from one table to another table
138:51 - now select star from
138:57 - employee so
139:00 - this is the data present in employee
139:02 - table and
139:07 - this is data present installation
139:11 - now i want to copy this all the data
139:16 - into the amplitube okay so i write
139:19 - insert
139:21 - into target table
139:25 - which is entry in this case
139:30 - select start from
139:36 - that's it we are going to insert
139:39 - data in employee from this one
139:43 - okay insert file now let us see the data
139:48 - in the employable
139:52 - [Music]
139:57 - as you can see student data is
140:00 - copied in employee table so
140:03 - this is one can copy data from one table
140:06 - to another table
140:08 - so let me just close this
140:12 - now open pc admin
140:17 - in test database open quality
140:23 - okay now
140:27 - i want to insert the employee data
140:32 - into the student table okay
140:36 - but first of all student table
140:40 - is not empty so
140:43 - let us see this one table subscribe from
140:51 - this data i have already copied into
140:53 - employable so again if i try
140:56 - to copy the data into some table again
140:59 - it will give me an
141:00 - error because of the primary key
141:01 - constraint okay
141:03 - so let me just erase the data
141:23 - okay if you have seen my
141:27 - earlier videos i have explained what is
141:30 - truncate
141:31 - basically truncate is used to delete
141:34 - all the data present in the table okay
141:39 - so let us see if it's
141:42 - let's try from
141:46 - as you can see it has nothing okay now i
141:50 - want to
141:51 - put data back into strong table from the
141:54 - table okay let me just show you the
141:58 - employee target
142:09 - okay it has nine rows
142:12 - insert
142:16 - into now this time target table will be
142:19 - instrumentable because we want to insert
142:21 - the trying to strengthen
142:23 - and we are going to select data from the
142:25 - empty table set it
142:27 - to select star from
142:34 - again let us understand this statement
142:37 - instant into because we want to insert
142:39 - something
142:40 - into the table target table will be
142:42 - student because we want to
142:44 - copy data into this point and we are
142:47 - going to put
142:48 - data to stone by taking it from the
142:51 - employee table
142:52 - so we write employee table in this
142:54 - source table
142:55 - okay very successful
143:01 - now let us see select
143:05 - start from
143:09 - student as you can see
143:15 - data has been copied into student table
143:17 - now runtable and the employable
143:20 - is the same data
143:23 - now let me just show you how you can
143:25 - provide some condition
143:27 - so let me just truncate this time
143:31 - table
143:36 - okay now
143:40 - select start from
143:44 - student i want to
143:47 - copy the
143:51 - data
143:55 - i have copied these four rows from the
143:58 - employee table earlier okay
143:59 - now i want to transfer it to the
144:01 - employee table again okay
144:04 - so how i can write it okay
144:12 - insert into
144:18 - employee will be able target table
144:22 - we are going to select data from this
144:24 - one table
144:29 - from
144:33 - where now it has roll number okay
144:39 - roll number like we are going to use
144:44 - white cards if you have not seen my past
144:46 - video
144:47 - then you should see it because
144:50 - i've explained how to use wildcard okay
144:54 - like
145:00 - underscore represent only one digit
145:04 - now uh roll number is the data type of
145:07 - integer
145:08 - so i have to write
145:11 - text careful for explicit typecast
145:16 - okay insert photos let us see the
145:20 - employable
145:23 - start from
145:26 - empty as you can see
145:30 - our data is back so
145:34 - this is how you can use intel insert
145:36 - into select statement
145:38 - to copy the data from one table to
145:41 - another table
145:42 - and also you can provide some conditions
145:45 - thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge with this video we are starting with new programming series which is based upon postgresql so before going further let us first discuss about what is database first of all what is data in simple words data can be fact related to any object in consideration if we consider a human object then name age height weight etc anything that can define a person is a data a data has many format it can be text number picture image file pdf etc that all be considered as data now what is database databases support storage and manipulation of data if we have data we need something to manipulate that data that's why database come into picture if you consider an online telephone directory definitely it is a database because it store people information like numbers contact details and we use this telephone directory to find the data if we consider a social network like facebook it contains data about people their friends their activities messages advertisements and a lot small which is also a database now to manage all of this database we need a system that is called database management system and that's why postgres will come into picture postgresql is a powerful and open source object relational database that uses and extends this sql language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads it supports asset properties some of you may not aware of what is asset properties so let me tell that first in asset property a stands for atomicity it means that either all the instruction follows or neither should be it must be atomic c stands for consistency after performing sql queries your data your database must be consistent i stands for integrity integrity means all the transaction should perform independently they do not depends on each other and lastly d stands for durability which means reliability your database must be durable so you can get the right data now postgresql runs on all the major operating system whether it is windows mac or linux and it is no surprise that oscar sql has become the open source lesson database of choice for many people and organizations it provides so many of features that nowadays most of the organization uses the postgresql it comes with many features like administrator to protect data integrity and build fault tolerant environment and helps you to manage your data no matter how big or small the data set whether your database is small or big you can use postgresql we can also extends our database for example we can define our own data types our own custom function and we can even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database that means a single database can be used with multiple programming languages now this is the main features of the postgresql first of all data types it supports most of the data types whether this integer float or string or character or where care or every type of database data integrity as i as i told you in data integrity in asset property all the transaction should be performed independently it is a reliable and disaster recovery it also provides supports for recovery security it is secure and extensibility means we can write our own custom function our own data types in this video we will learn how to install postgres sql in your mac operating system the first step is open your browser just type post gray sql here the first search result it shows postgresql.org just click on that now go to download options here you can see mac operating system just click on that now there are several ways to download postgresql this is download the installer this is postgres.app we are going to use this just click on this go to downloads and here you can download so once you download it just open that i am going to wait because i have already downloaded it just open that dmg file now you just need to drag these postgres and drop into application folder okay you can see in your applications this is post place just click on that you can see here empty data dictionary we can start our server by initializing it you can see several users in this vijayanam post place and this is template one now the final step is just go to the introduction we have initialized the server now we need to configure our path so just copy this entire command open your terminal and just paste it over here press enter and this will last for your mac password so enter your mac password now you just need to restart the terminal minimize it okay now write psql hyphen here for user and this is a name which is post creates just write post grace and you can see our server has been started to see the list of databases you can write backslash list okay now to create database we can use create database and the name of the database and semicolon enter you can see our database is created as list and you can see our database test is created this is how you can install postgresql in your mac browser in this video we will see how to install postgresql on windows operating system so just open your browser okay so type postgresql here here's the first post ksql.org just click on that here you can see in download option just click here you can get various packages for various operating system like linux macos solaris windows just choose windows here click on the download installer and this is the various versions you can get the 12 version is available only for mac os and windows 64bit linux is not available yet if you want to install for linux then you have to download 10.10 so choose whatever you want to choose that suits your opening system i'll download windows 64 version okay so you can save i already got the file so i just cancel it so once the download is finished just click on the file next this is the path where postgresql version 12 will be installed okay so this setup will install postgresql server pg admin 4 which is the gui based application to run your sql queries stake pictures for extra drivers and command line tools click on next next next this will take some time okay our installation has done and this is the stack builder stack builder is used to install various drives for like python or c plus plus so let me just finish here is the setup for stack builder if you have a remote server then you can choose remote server but i choose local next okay so this is the drivers you can get database drivers database server web development and tools and utilities but as of now i don't want either of them so i just click on the cancel okay so poster sql has been installed on our windows opening system you can get it here from the start menu post sql version 12 you can see stack builder pga admin for documentation shell just click on pg admin for so so okay so click on the servers this is postpass quality the postgres is the database you can find schema in public you have tables the tables which you will create is shown here there is a query tool and here you will write your sql queries so this is how you can install postgre sql and pg admin 4 on your windows based operating system in this video we will see how to create a database in postgresql so first of all just open your terminal it doesn't matter whether you are using mac open system windows or ubuntu just open your terminal or command prompt so write psql now whenever you press enter after writing psqa you are into postfast fuel command prompt now in order to see which are the databases that are present in your system you just need to write backslash and then press enter here you can see the name of the databases postgres template one template okay press q for exit now we will create a new database so in order to create a database you need to write a simple command write create then database then provide name of the database let's write test semicolon press enter okay so our database is created let me show you backslash help here you can see our database is created and it is created by me so the owner is vision of one okay guys now in order to draw means delete a database there is a command which is drop just write drop then name of the database then name of the database now let's see hey you can see our database test is deleted okay press q again now in order to connect to a database uh there's a command backslash c c stands for connect then name of the database that you want to connect post waves let's say so here you can see you are now connected to database post crease as user and the username so this is how you can create a database draw for database and connect to a database in command prompt but we have a better gui option let me just close it now there are several gui's environment available for postgresql in the market which i suggest you to use is this one pg admin this is the version you can download it for any open system you are using whether it is windows ubuntu or mac just google pg admin and download the version that suits to your computer open it so this is how it looks it opens in the browser so this is the servers just click on that i already create one server which i named learn but if you want to create a new server just right click on it create and then server here you can provide the name of your server and in connection field you can give the address to the server or host name if you do not want to connect to a specific server just write localhost okay so this is our server and this is the databases so here you can see this is the icon for query tool just click on that this area you can see here you can write your all sql queries so let us create one database create database the name of the database text now here you can see the icon it says execute so yes very much sorry for that create database text now just right click on and refresh here you can see our database is created now in order to drop the database it is pretty much the same as we have done in the command prompt f5 is software key for execute again i refresh and you can see so this is how you can create and draw the database basically in our previous video we saw that how to create and drop a database and in this video i'm gonna show you how to create a table so first of all you need to open your terminal or command prompt write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system write backslash l here you can see we have a test database and we are going to use that one so for connect to the test database right let's see you can name the database semicolon now we are connected to database test now we need to create a table which present in this test database so the command is created table then name of the table let's say employee now brackets small brackets in small brackets uh we provide the name of the columns and their respective data types now there are various data types available in postgraduate sql that you can use like if you want to use numbers then you can use integer begin small and float real if you want to store character then you can use care where care and you can also use text for long term so if you want to know about if you want to know more about data types then you can go to the documentation of post so let us say first column is name and i want data type of length 10 10 is the length of the name column then i use id and id okay now the most important thing in the table is primary key i defined id as my primary key for the employee table now what is the primary key well we will discuss more about primary key in our later videos but for now for the sake of convenience you just need to know that every table must have a primary key a column defined as a primary key so that that column can uniquely identify a table so id are unique for all the employees so i choose id as my primary key so right column and primary key then id name of the column that you want to set as primary key brackets close okay our table is created so how we can save it this table so write backslash here you can see employee table is created here you can also see this is called schema which is public we will discuss more about schema in our later videos so stay tuned for that now if we want to know the structure of our table then simply write backslash the name of the table here you can see our employee table has two column name and id and this is the respective data types integer and so close this now we can start with each admin okay now just refresh it in text in schema in public schema tables this is the table employee so let us create one more table in this test database so another query tool create table now name of the table let's say student restaurant has roll number and the data type of this role number will be in it and a student also has name name can be anywhere now roll number will be a primary key and execute just refresh here and you can see in tables we have student table okay here you can expand this and columns roll number and name now if you want to release this table then write draw table then name of the table just refresh it and you can see strong table has been deleted so this is how you can create a table and drop and in this video i will show you how to insert values in those tables so first of all open your terminal write psq here you can see we have test database we are going to use that and to connect this database write slash c and the name of the database now we are connected with the name of the table student brackets now specifying the columns roll number and the length is now the primary key and all these strands has unique roll number we will set row number as a primary key okay our table is created and let us see the table slash d and you can see okay so to insert data into this table into the name of the table then column names in which you want to insert the values then values here you can provide values now this is how you can insert values in the table okay so let's click the terminal okay so here we have test database let us try to insert some values in these tables okay here is one thing if we wanted to insert all the values for the all the values for all the columns it means that for every column you have an value which you wanted to you want to insert so in this case you don't need to write the column names you can directly start with the values values one zero two let's say okay one row is inserted this is how you can insert as many as value you want we can also insert multiple values in order to do that just put comma here let us change this value robot and you can see two values has been extensive so this is how you can insert the multiple values in the table and remember one thing whenever you specify the column names here like in this case number and name then you have to insert the values uh in respective order it means you if you write roll number first and roll number cup first and you write name second then roll then name common second okay so order is very important second programming knowledge in our previous video we saw that how to insert values in the table and in this video we will see how to fetch data from the table so first of all open the terminal or command prompt okay write psql okay so let us first see which are the databases present in our system for that use cell here you can see we have test database so we are going to use that slide c for connect and name of the database now we are connected to test database let us see which are the tables present in this database for that use backslash t and you can see we have student table here let's see which are the columns and you can see we have roll number and name roll number is integer and name is work here so let us try to insert some data fetch data from the table the command is select then name of the column you want to fetch let's say roll number and name from which table student table if you want to select all the columns present in your table then you don't require to write all the column names you can simply write select start from table student the result will be the same okay let's just with that open pg admin okay so in this database probably tables we have printable it is the same as command prompt select star and this is if you want name first and after that you want problem then you can also write name and then roll number okay so in this case the roll number will be dispenses the second column so this is how you can fix data from the table in this video we will see how to fetch distinct value from the table so let us first open terminal write psql okay so let us first see which are the databases present in our system here you can see we have test database so let me connect to it let's see and this is the table let us try to insert some more value in that table insert into student values let's say 110 but again robot it is possible that two students have the same name okay three values has been inserted so let us see the data select from student and you can see so one thing you can notice from here is region come twice and robert comes thrice so there are multiple entities in these tables and when you use normal select star from student you get redundant value okay so if you do not want the redundant value and you want only unique value which is distinct value from the table then you can use distinct keyword you can use the distinct then the name of the column name select distinct name from student here you can see you can only get the values which are unique and only one time natasha lilly wrote him any robot bridging in previous result bridging comes twice but in this reason region comes only one time and robot only one so this is how we can select distinct value so let's quit the terminal and open our pc admin here also we have student table okay select start from student and you can see multiple entities and as we done in the terminal you can only need to write distinct keyword listing name and you can get a distinct values so this is how we can use distinct keyword to get unique values from the table in this video we will see how to use where clause with select statement so in our previous video we saw that how to use select statement to face data from the table and in this video we use very close with it so now let us see which are the databases present in our system so here we have test database for connect to this database let's see test and we have student table so we write select let's say we only want roll number so here you can see we get 10 rows because the table has only 10 rows and you can notice one thing um we can picturize this and the columns in this statement whether we use roll number one if we use name instead of roll number even after that we get only 10 rows and in the previous season we get 10 rules so in previous results we get roll number because we filter the column with roll number and in the second segment we filter the statement with name column so what if we want to filter the rows also we do not want all zeroes i own the student whose role number is one zero five let's say so in this condition we can use where so right select let's say star from student where now here we can specify our connection so we want to filter on the role so is equal to let's say 105. here you can see we get only one row because there is only one student who has roll number one zero five so this is how you can filter the rows with the help of where clause so let me just quit proper pg admin okay so here we can also use the same statement name is equal to let's say robert we get two values three values sorry because robot comes three times and these are the roll numbers you can also filter the column as i teach you earlier let's say select roll number function where name is equal to robot so this is how you can filter the rows as well as columns in this video we will see how to use and operator to join multiple condition in our sql statement so first of all to open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system so we use test database type c and the name of the database and it happened that we are going to use this runtime so let me show you what student table is actually here you can see it has two columns so let me write a simple selection okay so it has 10 rows and if i want to filter it with the rows and we can is greater than one zero five so here you can notice one thing that after where close i provide the condition roll number greater than one zero five this is the condition and there is only one condition but in real life in real scenarios there may have multiple condition so if you want to join the condition which are more than two then you can use and operator we can use like and and specify the another condition let's say number greater than 05 but less than one million here you can see the roll number is between one zero five and triple one so this whole condition will be true if both the condition will be true if even one of them is not true then the whole condition becomes false let's say okay so we specify a robot here okay so both have probably number greater than one zero five and the name is now if i write equal to let's say 145 and name is equal to robert this condition is true but this condition is false so the whole condition become false so we will get nothing yeah you can see so let me just close the terminal and open pg admin test database and require tool so this let's say name is equal to greater than one so you can see both the conditions satisfied that's why the whole condition becomes true and we get the result if one of them will be false let's say and we get nothing so this is how you can join multiple condition using end operator in this video we will see how we can use our operator to join multiple conditions in sql queries so first of all open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system so we have this test database so we are going to use that one only let's see for connecting and we have student table in our previous video we saw that how we can use and operator to join multiple queries so this time we are going to use our operator there is only one simple difference between and and our operator in our operator if we want that all statement will become true that it is not necessary that every condition that you write into sql query have to become true if any one of them become true then all conditions become true let me say select start from student is greater than let's say 20 and i'm using here and name is equal to pj and we get nothing because region name is present but roll number greater than 220 is not present in our table so in order to in order to satisfy this whole condition both individual condition must be true because we write end operator let us see if we change this with or then what will happen here you can see we get to those because in order to satisfy this whole condition if any of them is true then this whole condition becomes true so this is the difference between n and or operator so let me just create it okay so let me write a simple query select with lego number here let's say name is equal to vision name is equal to robot here we can see which income twice in the table and robot comprised so there are total five zero that we will get i can write star here and you can see so this is how you can use all operator to join multiple condition in your skill pace in this video we will see how you can use order by close in your sql carries so first of all open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present number system so we are going to use the test database let's see for connect and test it and this is the table we have student table and it has roll number and so let us see the data so we see data and was present in our table now what is the use of order by close from the name suggest itself order by clause is used to order your result in ascending or descending order so how to write it select from in order by then the name of the column by which you want to order the result let's say name i won't the result to be ordered by name and you can see region come first then himani lili it is in alphabetical order so by default when you didn't provide any ascending or dis descending uh keyboard uh it will uh order the result by ascending order if you want it to descend link order you can write the esc and you can see now it is in descending order in alphabetical you can also order it by the roll number here you can see it is in ascending order so let me just create it and open pg admin okay in databases test and tables and clickbait okay so let me first create a new table this time create table let's say employee it has employee id and the data type will be name name of the employee where 10 and empid will be our primary key so our table is created now insert some data let's say one two three okay has been certain right so we have these three reports so i want to order it by the employee id then i write order by and you can see it is in ascending order if i provide keyword pse then it will be descending we can also order it by the employee name and you can see you name going let's see so this is how you can use order by clause in your sql queries in this video we will see how we can use limit class in our sql queries so first of all open your terminal write psql so let us see which are the databases present our system so we have this many of databases and we are going to use this one test so for connecting to test database right let's see okay so now we are connected to test database and we have two tables employable and storage table so what is the use of limit clause actually um let me first show you let's start and it is displaying that 10 rows so one thing that you can notice from here whenever we are using this type of select statement the result will contain all the rows that are present in our table it's showing all the rows but what if we don't want all the data i want only first five rows or only seven rows or only three rows so how to set a limit for that so in order to set a limit we are going to use that limit keyword right select from student and second limit now how many rows do i want let's say i want only three rows then i write three and it will show me only three rows if i want nine rows i don't want the last row then it will show me nine rows it will not show me this one last one okay so let me just create it and open pg admin okay so let's employ we have three rows only here and i want only one row yes and one more thing you can also use expression here like employable doesn't have many data so let me use total table limit to let's say 2 into 3 minus 1 and that will be 5 and you can see what if it goes to minus and still um i think the plus and negative marking does not affect this okay so let me write four plus three and you can see we get seven rows so this is how we can use limit clause in sqlite in this video we will see how to update the table means how to modify the data which are already present in the table so first of all open your terminal write psql okay so let us see which are the databases present in our system next lesson and we are going to use test database for that let's see for connecting and name of the database so we have two tables employee and student let us see the data of this one table okay so we have 10 rules so what if the scenario where i want to change the name of the student whose role number is 103 currently the name is rock and i want to change it to diana let's say so for updating table the query is updated the name of the table whose data you want to modify in this case it is student now the new value you want to insert that for which column name of the column is name is equal to lyanna now where this diana will appear it will appear here whose role number is update one let us see the data and here you can see one zero three let us set it order by problem okay here you can see one zero three it has been changed to diana from rock so this is how you can update table you can also use multiple condition in like update sorry update student set name is equal to let's say where roll number will change we write r and this will update two rows first of all this rows and the second one is this so you can see brian here and brandon so this is how you can use update so let me just close this opportunity okay we have only three rows so i want to change the employee id of the employee whose name is bruce okay so update employee set where name is equal to rules sorry name it updates it updated let us see okay it is updated so this is how you can modify the data present in your table using update method in this video we will see how we can delete data from the table in postgresql once you've inserted the data into your table there will be time when you need to delete those data from this table the reason can be you don't need that data anymore or you wanted to make some space on your server etc etc so before going into execution let us first see what is the syntax for that so let me just show you the syntax so the syntax is delete because we want to delete data from the table then we have to specify the name of the table from which we want to delete the data delete from then you can provide table name then where after that you can provide your condition column name is equal to value so this is the syntax for deleting rows from the table the delete keyword then specify the name of the table and after that you can give the condition so all the rows which matches with this condition will be deleted let us see an example open your terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that write backslide as you can see we have various databases here and among them we are going to use this test database so for connecting to the test database please write backs let's see for connect and then name of the database now we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in text database for that write backslash d as you can see we have employee table and student table so let us see the structure of this one table so and then name of the table so the student table have two columns roll number and name and roll number is the primary key for this storage table let us see the data present in stone tables namely we have 10 rows and this is the row number and the name so let us assume that i want to delete the row where student have the name bridging okay i want to delete this rows from this table so then provide the name of the table from which you want to delete the data so in this case the name will be used again delete the name of the table and then the condition which delete this row press enter delete one this number indicate how many rows was deleted one row has been deleted so we can say select star from student you can see this row is no longer part of the student table so this is how you can delete data from your table now we can also delete multiple rows from the table if the condition we specify matches with multiple rows then multiple rows will be deleted this time we are going to use employee table so let us first see the data from the employee so it has only three rows bridging net and groups and two columns employee id and employment now i want to delete the employee whose employee id is 124 and employee name is equal to bridging okay so delete from then we are specifying the name of the table where condition id is equal to one to four or if you notice this i am using or here because if i use end operator then there is no row that satisfy the condition because one two four has and two rows will be deleted here you can see so let us first see data and you can see so just close the terminal and open pg admin here databases we have test database in public okay let us first see the data from the employee it has only one row so what i'm trying to say is if you do not specify any condition while deleting rows like this delete from that's it you do not specify any condition here then all the rows will be deleted it means all the data which you have stored in your table will be deleted so be careful while you are writing this query i am showing you since our table has only one row one row is deleted you can see say from employee our table is empty now so this is how you can delete single rows multiple rows with the statement in this video we will see how we can delete or drop a table in postgresql in our previous video we saw that how to delete data preserving table and in this video we will see how we can delete entire table so before going into execution let us first understand the syntax okay to delete or drop the table the syntax is drop in table the name of the table which you want to delete and that's it it's pretty much easy so again first of all you specify drop keyword because you want to drop a table then you want to drop a table that's why you are writing table here and the name of the table of course so let us open the terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right backslash l here we have test database so we are going to use that one for using that test database i write backslash c for connecting and text now we are connected to press database now let us see which are the tables present in our test database for that right basis we have two tables first one is employee and second one is one now i'm going to create a new table because i don't want to delete these tables so let me just create another table okay create table then name of the table we will write let us see this time let us say animal okay and specify the column name so the first column will be name data type will be where name of the animal and let us see color of the animal okay and i specify sorry let us see it and the paid id which will be input and paid addict into our primary key so our table is created let us see this table and this is the table let us see this structure okay so name color now i want to delete this table i've created a new table which is animal and now i want to delete means drop detail so as we learn right drop table the name of the table that's it and it will drop the table let us see as you can see animal is not listed here it means it is deleted you can also delete multiple table at once so for that let me just create two temporary table okay create table then name of the table let's say d1 because uh later i'm going to delete it okay i write id and in and make it a primary key okay again let me create table with the name of p2 and rest will be the same let us see okay so we have two tables d1 and d2 and now i want to delete two table segments so right drop table then name of the table d1 comma entity and our table is as you can see we deleted multiple table in one statement so open your pgaming okay in test and query tool okay so let us first create new tables name of twitter will be the same given okay our table is created now to see just right click and refresh and you can see d1 columns we have id column okay so to drop a table this syntax will be the same drop table the name of the table which is d1 in this case and table is deleted so just right click and refresh and you can see d1 is no longer part of the tables um just be careful while using this query because once you delete the table you cannot restore the data which was present in those table so be careful while performing this type of way in this video we will see how we can delete all the data from the table in our previous video we saw that how we can drop the table and in this video we will see if you want to truncate your table then how you can do it so let us first understand the syntax so okay so the syntax is pretty obvious truncate because you want to truncate then table and name of the table that you want to truncate and that's it it is syntax now lots of people asking that if they can use delete query to truncate the table and my answer is yes you can use the delete statement but the work that both the command is doing is pretty much the same but the approach they are taking is different if i talk about delete query then delete statement first scan the entire table and then delete each row one by one if we talk about truncate then it will delete the entire table first it means all the rows will be gone and then recreate it recreate the table with the same schema so if you are working with small table it means that your table doesn't have that many of rows then it doesn't affect that much if you are using truncate or delete statement but if you are dealing with large amount of data let's say your table contains millions of rows then using delete statement will be more costlier than truncate statement it puts lots of pressure on this server and it requires a lot of time if i compare it to the truncate so it's better to use truncate table in order to delete all the data present in the table so this is the syntax and let us first open the terminal okay so write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that use backslash l okay so we have test database so we are going to use that for connecting it right let's let's see name of it now we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in test database so we have employable and school table let us see the data present student level select basic select statement and it has a no rose okay it is empty so let us first insert some values in this table insert into values so it has id and name we can set multiple values okay okay i forgot to specify the name of the table insert into student okay so four rows has been inserted let us okay so this is for data now i want to delete all the rows all the data present in this table so we are going to use that token command okay and name of the table this file truncate table is executed let us see if table is present or not that sd as you can see it is empty so this is how you can use truncate command to truncate your table so close your terminal open pgm test okay okay so this time we are going to use employee table so let us see which are the data present in pivotable sorry for that okay so it is also empty so let us press insert some value employee values it has is okay three row has been inserted now okay the command will be say truncate the name of the table that you want to track it this time employee so table is truncated let us see as you can see so this is how you can truncate your table to delete all the data present in the table in this video we will see how you can modify or alter your table once you have created friends there may be some scenarios where once you have created your table after some time you need to do some modification so how you can perform those type of queries in postgresql let us first understand understand the syntax okay okay so there are various tasks that you can perform with single elder query first of all you can add a new column then you can drop a column and you can also modify the data type of the column okay so first let us understand how to add any column the syntax is alter table then name of the table then add because you want to add something then name of the column column name and the data type that's it it is same syntax first of all you need to write alter because you want to modify some changes then table then you specify the name of the table then add because you want to add something and the column name that you want to add and the data type of that code so let's open pc admin we have database test database okay so now let us add some column in our existing table here you can see we have employable and student table in student table we have only two columns roll number and name so let us add a new column last name instrument table so alter because we want to alter the existing table table name of the table now we want to add something and the name of the column now i want to store only the initial only the first alphabet of the surname so our data type will be k okay so very different successfully okay so just you need to right click on the table and refresh and we have a name here you can see roll number name and so this is how you can add a new column to existing table also let us try to add a new following application as well okay so in empty we have employee id and employee name so let us add a salary column okay syntax will be the same editor table then name of the table this time we want to add something in employee so employee then add name of the column and the data that will be okay okay alter table name of the table in this case it will be employee we want to add something that's why we write add here name of the new column that we want to add salary and the data type will be okay so what very successfully return just rightly refresh and you can see salary is there okay so this is how you can add new columns to elder query so now come to the drop now we can only in we can not only add an equal we can also drop an existing column the syntax is very similar table a table name now this time we want to drop something so right drop then we specify the column that we want to drop and that's it alter table name of the table drop because we want to drop or delete something and the name of the column we want to delete okay open pga mean now let us try to remove this salary from the employee okay so alter table now the name of the table drop and the column which will be salary again alter table because you want to modify or alter the table then specify the name of the table then drop and this value okay f5 query written successfully just right click on that and refresh and you can see cell will be gone let us see one more example try to remove this alien okay alter table name of the table will be used this time from okay just right click on and you can see roll number and name only okay so this is how we can drop a column now let us come to the last point which is modify the data type of the column okay so alter table name of the table now we want to modify alter again now which column we want to modify column name type type is the keyword and the new data type let me type new data type here so that you will not confuse new data type okay alter table name of the table then again alter the name of the column you want to modify type because they want to modify the data type and your data type open pc admin again let us first of all i do not want to mess up with my existing column so let me insert a new column then later on we will change the data type okay so student table enter table name of the table then again alter sorry first we want to add now we will add a name and okay just like click refresh and you can see now we will change the data type so replace add with alter alter column name l name right and now i change my mind i want to store entire surname instead of initials okay so right back that's a length of that and our query written successfully just refresh and right click over here and go to properties in definition and you can see character varying length of 10 its change again let us see one more example this time employee okay we have id and name let us try to insert a new column which will be middle name okay okay refresh let me show you the properties first of all and it is character option okay now i want to alter now can be the time okay but it didn't successfully we refresh here m name go to properties definition and you can see data type is changed to worker of the seventh so this is how you can use alter query to perform various tasks in postgresql in this video we will see how we can select in between ranges with the help of between operator okay so let us first open the terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right backslash so here we have this test database so we are just going to use test test database so for connecting to test database write backslash c formatting test now we are connected to test database let us see which are the tables present in our system we have two tables under the test database first one is employee second one is student structure let us see which are the data present in our system okay so table is empty so let us first insert some values okay that's it we have inserted five rows let us see that okay so here we have five now i want to find out these students whose role number lies between one zero one and one zero three okay so how do we do it we write select greater than or equal to 1 and total number less than or equal to one year right so we get these three rows now this condition roll number greater than or equal to one zero one and roll number less than equal to one zero three now here we need to specify row number twice and this makes this condition so long so there is one keyword which you can use to sort this condition right select from student where roll number then right between is the keyboard one zero three and sorry one zero one and one zero three as you can see we do not need to specify a round number twice here just use between and give the values and result will be the same as the previous one as you can see so just close your terminal open pj admin okay so in test database here and very cool okay so let us see this time this time we will use employee table okay so it's empty so let us first insert some value insert employee values one mia to brad okay sorry and okay so we have inserted four rows let us see that okay so this is our data now first of all we use the condition where emp id greater than equal to one and here is therefore equal to three so you can see the result we have one two three and corresponding employee name okay so we can write this with the output between just remove that one p id between one and three and you can see result will be the same as the previous one so this is how you can use between keyword to search between ranges and note down one thing that you can only use numbers here you cannot use characters okay in this video we will see how we can use alias name for column basically it's a different name that we want to show to the output on the screen the actual name will not change it will change only the result in which column name is displayed okay so first of all let us understand the syntax okay so select then the column name then we write as and here comes the new name new column name from table okay so select column name the original column name as the new column that we want to display on the output from the table name and if you want to give alias name to multiple column that can also be done in poster sql you just need to write select column name one as new column name then comma for separating column name to and new column name and you can specify multiple columns here and at the end of it table name okay so this is how you can specify multiple columns for alias okay okay so open your terminal write psql let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right x l here as you can see we have test database so for connecting that test database right backslash c for connecting and name of the database test now we are connected to test database let us see which are the tables present in our test database so we have two tables here employee table and student table as you can see so let us see the structure of student table for that write backslash d then name of the table so student table contains two columns first one is roll number and let us select some data okay so here you can see it comes with the original column number roll number and now i want to display roll number as id i don't want to change the original column name but i want that whenever i fire this query the people who are going to see this result will get id comes here okay so we write select roll number is id we don't want to change the name front name of the table okay again select the original column name in this case it will be round number is id name because i want to display name also from the table okay as you can see the result will be the same except the column name roll number is replaced by this id if i again write star here instead of specifying column and you can see since the original name is not changed okay so just close the terminal and open pg admin and database test very good okay so this time we are going to use employee table so let us see the columns and data we have four rows and two columns basically let us change all the columns name this time select let's say select emp id as tid e name is employees from okay as you can see our emp id is replaced by eid and the e name is replaced by employees so let us try to understand the syntax second time okay first of all select then the original column name then s in the earliest name that you want to give t id the original column e name and its alias name is employees from the table okay and remember one thing it's very important that it doesn't affect the original column name it is just only for display purpose if i write select from then the original column name comes up okay employee id name so this is how you can give alias name to columns in this video we will see how we can specify multiple values in select statement so first of all open your terminal okay write ps given and now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that right here you can see we have test database so we are just going to use that for connecting the test database right gets let's see for connect and test now we are connected to test database so let us see now which are the tables present in this database for that backslash d we have employee table and student table so let us see the structure of student table first so we have roll number and name here and student table has the primary key role number okay so let us see the data present in splendid select star from student so we have five rows here so let us consider a scenario where i want the data of the student which has roll number of either 1 0 1 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so how you can write it okay so let us try the method which we learned earlier okay select start so we get these three rows because this trade student has roll number either one zero one or one zero three or one zero five but look at this condition it's unnecessarily long because we specify a roll number three times here so how we can get rid of this there's an elegant solution for that all right select start from okay so this looks more readable and it is much smaller than the previous one and the output will be the same it will gives us the data where student has roll number either one zero one or one zero three or one zero five so let us close the terminal and open pg admin in test database open query tool this time we will use employee table so employee table has two columns employee id and employee name so let us see the data select start from employee we have four rows here employee id is one two three four so i want to select the employees whose employee id are either one or four okay so we can write like employee where np id is equal to 1 or pid is equal to 4. and you can see the output consists of two rows mia and okay we can write it in another matter where emp id we specify in keyword in and then we specify the output will be the same we got two rows yeah only so this is how we can use in keyword to specify multiple values in select query and you can specify as many as values as you want okay let us try one more example so that you can get clear idea about it so let us try this with another table a new table okay so create table name of the table will be let's say mobile first of all id of the mobile which will be company so let's say okay primary key will be id okay so whatever is created let us see let us insert some values id function okay one zero four so we have inserted four rows let us see the data select start from mobile okay here is our data now i want to select the mobile whose id is one zero one one zero three and one zero four i don't want this one zero two samsung okay so i write select start from mobile because mobile is the name of the table where id in then we specify the multiple values one zero one one zero three as you can see we have the data which has the id of one zero one or one zero three or one zero four we can also specify the one zero then we get all the data okay we can also specify the particular column i want only company as you can see so that's it this is how you can specify multiple values in order to find the data in this video we will see how we can use like operator in select statement and how we can use wildcard with it to improvise the condition okay so let us first understand the syntax and what are the valid cards okay so we are going to use like operator and basically we have total two wild cards the first one is percentage and the second one is underscore percentage and underscore are two wild cards that provides by sql so what are therefore okay basically percentage sign is indicates the multiple characters zero for multiple characters while the underscore represents only one character you can understand it much better if i show you an example okay let us open terminal write psql okay so let us see which are the databases present in our system for that write backslash l so here you can see we have test database for connecting that test database we are going to use backslash c for connecting and name of the database test so we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in our system so we have employee table mobile table and student table let us first see which are the data present in our student table select star from student we have five rows roll number and name is the column now what if i want the student whose name start with character b okay so i will write like this select start from so that pair provide the column and we are going to use like copyright like and then we use wildcards okay like the first character must be alphabet b okay so i write b and the rest of the character can be anything so i want to specify the multiple character here so i write percentage okay semicolon and you can see there are total two students whose name starts with character b bridging and bow so we get two rows let us consider one more example i want to select the student whose first character can be anything but the last character must be a okay so first character can be anything and the last character will be a okay so last character must be a and the rest of the characters can be anything so we go to rose julia andrea let us try to use underscore operator now i want to find out the student whose name has only three characters okay only three characters so i write underscore that represent one character second underscore and third one represents three characters as you can see we are getting bob as the results because bob is the only star whose name consists of three characters only okay so this is how you can use wildcards with like operator so let me just close these and open pga me in test database very good okay so now we are considering the second table which is employable so it has basically four rows as you can see we are getting only one row because only this employee is satisfying the condition okay apart from the name or student name that has worker type of data we can also use like operator with integer data type okay so for that we are going to use run table so we have five rows now i want to select the student where roll number like let's say the first number can be anything but last number must be three okay so perceptions represent multiple numbers and the last digit is three so the last digit must be three now i cannot use these syntax it will give me an error as you can see because like operator is by default work with the text or work editor type so i have to explicitly type trust it with text and you can see the last digit is three and the rest of is can be anything i can also modify this the first digit must be one the middle can be anything and let me just write underscore okay as you can see so basically this is how you can use the file card with the like operator to improvise your search user in this video we will see how we can copy data from one table to another table so to perform this type of task we are going to use insert into select statement so there are few things that you must need to know before you're going into further that is when you are copying data from one table to another table the corresponding column data types must be the same that's obvious because you cannot copy and call down data which says data type of integer into the table in which the data type has worker or character so corresponding data type of the column must be the same so let us see the statement first okay so we are going to use insert into then the name of the table target table in which we want to insert the data and select from the source table here you can provide some condition if you want okay so again insert into target table in which you want to insert the data select start from source table from which you are going to copy the data and provide the condition if you want any okay so let us open terminal write psql now let us see which are the databases present in our system for that we are going to use backslash l here as you can see we have test database for connecting the test database we are going to use backslash c for connecting and then name of the database now we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in our system backslash b so we have total three tables here employee mobile and student so let us see the structure of employee table back that's the name of the table so it has employee id and employee name integer data type and where okay now let us see these student structure as you can see corresponding data type are the same integer and okay so we can copy data from one table to another table now select star from employee so this is the data present in employee table and this is data present installation now i want to copy this all the data into the amplitube okay so i write insert into target table which is entry in this case select start from that's it we are going to insert data in employee from this one okay insert file now let us see the data in the employable as you can see student data is copied in employee table so this is one can copy data from one table to another table so let me just close this now open pc admin in test database open quality okay now i want to insert the employee data into the student table okay but first of all student table is not empty so let us see this one table subscribe from this data i have already copied into employable so again if i try to copy the data into some table again it will give me an error because of the primary key constraint okay so let me just erase the data okay if you have seen my earlier videos i have explained what is truncate basically truncate is used to delete all the data present in the table okay so let us see if it's let's try from as you can see it has nothing okay now i want to put data back into strong table from the table okay let me just show you the employee target okay it has nine rows insert into now this time target table will be instrumentable because we want to insert the trying to strengthen and we are going to select data from the empty table set it to select star from again let us understand this statement instant into because we want to insert something into the table target table will be student because we want to copy data into this point and we are going to put data to stone by taking it from the employee table so we write employee table in this source table okay very successful now let us see select start from student as you can see data has been copied into student table now runtable and the employable is the same data now let me just show you how you can provide some condition so let me just truncate this time table okay now select start from student i want to copy the data i have copied these four rows from the employee table earlier okay now i want to transfer it to the employee table again okay so how i can write it okay insert into employee will be able target table we are going to select data from this one table from where now it has roll number okay roll number like we are going to use white cards if you have not seen my past video then you should see it because i've explained how to use wildcard okay like underscore represent only one digit now uh roll number is the data type of integer so i have to write text careful for explicit typecast okay insert photos let us see the employable start from empty as you can see our data is back so this is how you can use intel insert into select statement to copy the data from one table to another table and also you can provide some conditions thanks for watching
