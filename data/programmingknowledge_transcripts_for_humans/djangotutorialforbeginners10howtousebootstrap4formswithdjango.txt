00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so this
00:02 - is the tenth tutorial of our django
00:04 - series so i again welcome you all to
00:06 - programming knowledge so so the guys
00:08 - this is the github link of a repository
00:10 - you can download this project clone this
00:13 - project and run this project on your
00:15 - local machine I have defined below the
00:16 - instructions how you can install this
00:18 - project on your local machine
00:20 - as well as how you can run it so today
00:23 - we are working we are going to work with
00:24 - the forms so this is a tentative if you
00:27 - have any doubt regarding the
00:29 - architecture structure of django you can
00:31 - refer to our previous tutorials as well
00:32 - so first thing allowing let's get
00:36 - started with this so forms are made to
00:39 - for the user input so forms are usually
00:42 - made according to your door demand and
00:44 - requirement today we will create a form
00:46 - and then we will use forms and then what
00:51 - we are going to do we are going to
00:53 - integrate the front end part of our form
00:56 - will today we create a response to form
00:57 - layout and then we'll integrate the
01:00 - backend part of logic with the front-end
01:03 - part so we are going to get a quick how
01:06 - we see how we can integrate forms then
01:08 - we will see how to we can submit forms
01:11 - using the one with the request method
01:13 - and one with the post method then we
01:15 - will figure out the difference what the
01:17 - difference between the two so let's get
01:19 - started with this so today so this is my
01:22 - project so first I will run my server so
01:26 - I'll type Python manage to py run server
01:29 - and you I will move to my local host so
01:33 - I will refresh this page so the server
01:36 - will get started
01:37 - so yeah you here you can see the server
01:39 - has started so what we are going to do
01:42 - today so what we are going to do first I
01:45 - create a path the URL path path I'll
01:51 - create my form okay and I'll create a
01:59 - view with the name you start my form and
02:05 - I'll give this your other name is equal
02:09 - to my form as well okay that looks
02:13 - pretty fine so also we create a form and
02:18 - so I move to my views dot py file okay
02:23 - so here's my views dot py file so what
02:26 - I'm going to do so what I'm going to do
02:29 - and I'll define a view define my form
02:35 - and it will take a request as a
02:39 - parameter and I'll render an HTML page
02:44 - and what I'm going to do I'm going to
02:47 - type return ok return render request and
02:59 - I'll make an HTML page my form dot HTML
03:07 - so this was pretty fine so what I need
03:11 - to do so I need to define my form dot
03:15 - HTML inside my template page ok I'll
03:20 - move to my templates so I create a new
03:23 - file my form dot HTML so this looks
03:32 - pretty fine so what we are going to do
03:35 - today what are you going to do
03:37 - so this is our form that are my form dot
03:39 - HTML page so I have to find a few links
03:43 - we can move to this link and what we can
03:48 - do will move to this plane and what we
03:51 - can do we look how we can create
03:54 - responsive forms using bootstrap so this
03:56 - is going to be very good so we can see
03:59 - how we can create responsive form using
04:00 - bootstrap and what we are going to do so
04:04 - this is like a box container with an
04:07 - email address and password then check me
04:09 - out submit we can't create a form like
04:12 - this only and this is another one email
04:16 - address example select so this is a
04:18 - select option with the drop down
04:21 - behavior so this is a text area and this
04:25 - is a form
04:26 - the input type is equal to file so you
04:29 - here you can see this is input type is
04:31 - equal to file so why I'm telling you all
04:33 - this because this will make you have
04:35 - actual with how what kind of wickets we
04:38 - have work with the form then this is all
04:41 - about sizing and this is what this this
04:45 - is select and this is read only you can
04:48 - read this only note edit loud here then
04:52 - read only plain text so this is how we
04:55 - do so this is one of the range inputs
04:59 - this is the works and with the standard
05:02 - behavior then others are checkbox and
05:05 - this is disabled checkbox then default
05:08 - radio second default video disabled
05:10 - radio and inline so we have very much
05:14 - decent time amount of parameters to work
05:16 - with and then this is a form group so oh
05:20 - this form grid this form Rho and this
05:24 - explain all this how you can make a form
05:26 - well and we'll start this from scratch
05:29 - because this is what is going to vary
05:32 - one of the important parts and let's get
05:35 - started with designing our front-end
05:37 - part so first I will do what I do and
05:41 - this is simply pick any template and
05:45 - I'll place this because I have to extend
05:48 - my index dot HTML to my form page so
05:50 - I'll change this name my form okay now
05:56 - okay I'll remove this line okay and I'll
06:01 - be given a heading h1 let me give an
06:03 - heading my o and what I'm going to do
06:11 - I'm going to go to my local O's and type
06:15 - slash my home ok so this looks the this
06:21 - is my form so I've defined the heading
06:23 - to make sure that the template is
06:25 - working so what I can do next is I move
06:30 - to this page and what you can do you can
06:35 - have a simple layout okay
06:40 - you can have any of the simple layout
06:42 - let's get start with a simple one so
06:47 - we'll pick this okay or if you want me
06:52 - to I will make this from scratch okay
06:55 - first what you need to define you need
06:56 - to define a form group so we'll define a
06:59 - form group so for first we will define a
07:03 - div class is equal to container fluid
07:08 - okay this is a container then inside
07:11 - this we need to define a add row then
07:16 - I'll define a column called
07:22 - medium of size 6 or you can say with 6
07:26 - then I need to define a form okay so
07:30 - this will pretty fine now what do you
07:32 - need to define inside oh you need to
07:34 - define a div classes will form group so
07:36 - I'll use this div class is equal to form
07:41 - a group okay so what do you need to be
07:49 - so I'll use an another okay let's get
07:53 - proceed with this so you can see that
07:56 - for two inputs there are 1 div classes
07:59 - reform group and another is also
08:01 - difficult form group so suppose you are
08:03 - having two inputs div class is equal to
08:08 - form group so here you can see I have a
08:13 - container then a row then I call the
08:17 - column of of medium with six then a form
08:21 - then a fake I have to form groups that
08:24 - this means I'm going to define two
08:25 - inputs so one is input type is equal to
08:30 - text I will give this ID as my text and
08:35 - name is equal to my text as well and
08:40 - I'll define what you can say they have
08:45 - defined input type is about image email
08:48 - class is equal to form control so I'll
08:51 - define this class to this
08:53 - because this class is necessary or
08:59 - control okay so this looks pretty fine
09:07 - and I define a label label format form
09:14 - so here you can see they are must define
09:17 - a label label for so I will define a
09:19 - label my text my text ok this was pretty
09:29 - fine and what we can do I'll go to this
09:32 - page okay so here it is a form so but
09:37 - the right now there is no such in like
09:38 - in 9min so I will go to inspect okay
09:42 - when I move to my inspect I'll go to div
09:44 - class or core md6
09:45 - and I'll try some CSS out here so I do
09:51 - margin:0 auto so this looks pretty fine
09:55 - my form just to the center okay I'll do
09:58 - this side is equal to margin:0 auto and
10:05 - with the same I'll do with the heading
10:10 - as well so I'll try the CSS on this as
10:12 - well this is my heading so let's do
10:15 - something text align is equal to center
10:17 - okay this looks pretty fine and I'll
10:19 - give a little bit of margin sorry I'll
10:23 - get margin top and I'll use a relative
10:30 - unit and this is in terms of RAM so you
10:32 - can simply either you can copy the CSS
10:37 - and this is a key shortcut you can work
10:39 - with this and I will put a style tag
10:42 - here and I'll paste the CSS here so this
10:46 - was pretty fine so and I I'll right
10:50 - click here and I'll say format document
10:53 - okay this the format document for this
10:57 - is is this isn't working I'll check if
11:00 - something is okay and I have defined a
11:03 - heading
11:05 - I'll do some changes okay I'm having
11:08 - some issue with this you know I know
11:11 - this is fine right yes so I haven't
11:13 - heading okay now this was pretty fine
11:18 - and you can see I have a form with my
11:20 - text and I'll do the same okay
11:25 - I'll copy this quickly okay I will
11:31 - define us of a text area so this is the
11:35 - text area so what we can do so this is a
11:38 - text area and we had defined rows for it
11:42 - for how much rows we want so we'll
11:44 - quickly do this okay let's do this text
11:48 - area class is equal to form control
11:53 - control okay rules is equal to three
11:59 - okay before this I'll give an ID to it I
12:03 - T sorry I T my text area and as well as
12:13 - a name to it name is equal to I'll give
12:20 - this a name as well my text area okay
12:24 - this looks pretty fine and I'll close
12:28 - this text area so it automatically
12:31 - closes it and I'll define a label for my
12:39 - text area and this was going to be my
12:44 - text okay I'll use the capital m and
12:51 - capital T so this looks pretty fine and
12:54 - when I move to my page okay this looks
12:59 - pretty fine so this is the form we have
13:01 - made and will now test the
13:03 - responsiveness of this form so what we
13:06 - are going to do we are going to press
13:08 - control shift I or you can simply press
13:11 - inspect right click inspect then we use
13:15 - a layout okay now you can see the beauty
13:17 - of bootstrap so you can see I
13:19 - five for Responsive for me so here i
13:21 - phone six iPad
13:24 - okay this galaxy s5 so this is
13:28 - responsive nature of a form so and this
13:30 - is you can see pixel two and here you
13:33 - can see that these are form being
13:35 - responsive so this is a beautiful nature
13:36 - of bootstrap so thank you guys thank you
13:40 - so much so I'll catch up in the next
13:41 - tutorial we will integrate this content
13:44 - of part of our form with the back and
13:46 - got back in part so thank you guys
