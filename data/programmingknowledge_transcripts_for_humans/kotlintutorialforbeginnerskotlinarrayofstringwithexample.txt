00:00 - in the previous video we have discussed
00:01 - about arrays in kotlin and in this
00:04 - particular video we are going to
00:07 - learn about
00:08 - areas of string
00:10 - okay or an area of strings
00:13 - so
00:14 - i'll just go ahead and create a main
00:17 - function
00:18 - and inside the main function i will just
00:21 - create a variable
00:24 - string named string array
00:27 - and
00:28 - so if you remember for creating an array
00:32 - we have to use
00:33 - array of function and
00:36 - if
00:38 - we have to
00:39 - specify the data types we will use the
00:42 - less than and greater than sign and then
00:44 - we will use the open and close
00:46 - parenthesis and inside the open close
00:48 - parenthesis
00:49 - uh we will
00:51 - use the
00:55 - the the things that we have to add to
00:57 - this
00:58 - okay so uh i'll just create a string the
01:01 - array of string
01:04 - containing some strings so i'll just
01:06 - write hi
01:08 - this
01:09 - and again a string
01:11 - is
01:13 - and again string
01:16 - programming
01:20 - knowledge
01:22 - okay
01:23 - so
01:24 - it is a string
01:25 - [Music]
01:27 - it is an area of string containing four
01:29 - strings
01:32 - okay
01:33 - so specifically it is called an area of
01:35 - strings
01:36 - so what if i have to get a particular
01:42 - at a particular index
01:44 - so what if i have to get the string at a
01:46 - particular index so i can use a
01:48 - function
01:51 - that is
01:52 - the name of string that is string array
01:55 - and then dot
01:58 - get
02:00 - and then open and close parenthesis and
02:02 - then zero
02:04 - okay
02:04 - so what this
02:07 - function get does it does
02:09 - that
02:10 - it just
02:12 - gets the
02:14 - particular string at the particular
02:16 - index mentioned
02:18 - so when it shows a
02:20 - green line so when i go to it and hit
02:24 - alt plus enter
02:26 - it
02:26 - shows that replace get call with
02:28 - indexing operator and when i hit enter
02:30 - it
02:32 - chooses the
02:34 - open and close square box
02:37 - square bracket
02:38 - so the get function is the same as the
02:41 - square bracket that we used in the
02:42 - previous video
02:44 - okay so now if i just skip that
02:48 - and
02:51 - okay
02:53 - and uh
02:55 - so what if i have to change the
02:59 - change the string at a particular index
03:01 - so as i mentioned in the previous video
03:04 - what i have to do is
03:06 - write the name of the string
03:08 - that is
03:09 - write the name of the array
03:11 - and then
03:13 - use the square bracket
03:15 - and
03:16 - if i have to change the
03:18 - string at the zero index
03:22 - so i'll just
03:25 - write here
03:27 - hola
03:29 - okay so
03:31 - it changes the
03:34 - string at the zeroth index okay
03:37 - so when i
03:39 - print
03:42 - the
03:44 - string array
03:46 - what it does is
03:49 - so what happens when i print the whole
03:53 - array instead of printing a particular
03:56 - particular
03:57 - index of the array so it prints the this
04:00 - thing
04:01 - it prints l java lang string
04:05 - semicolon and this is an address
04:08 - so when i string when i print a
04:09 - particular array
04:11 - it it it shows that it is an array of
04:15 - containing strings and it shows its
04:17 - address
04:18 - that at this address the string is
04:20 - stored
04:21 - but it does not print that array
04:24 - so i'll just go ahead and print the
04:27 - zeroth element
04:29 - or the a string at element at index 0
04:34 - so we can see that
04:36 - the
04:37 - string at particular index
04:39 - has changed now what if i have to
04:43 - get the
04:45 - size of a particular array so for
04:47 - getting the size of a particular array
04:49 - is
04:50 - we use the function
04:51 - dot size
04:53 - so i will just
04:54 - print write the print statement
04:57 - and then i'll write the string name
05:00 - sorry the array name and
05:02 - i'll just write dot size
05:06 - now when i run this
05:08 - program
05:09 - this the seventh line
05:12 - prints the size of an array
05:14 - okay and we can see that the size of an
05:17 - array is
05:19 - size of this array is four
05:24 - so that's correct
05:26 - now what if i have to
05:29 - make a whole string from an array of
05:32 - string
05:33 - like i have to
05:35 - make this a particular string so i'll
05:38 - just
05:39 - name a value
05:41 - that should be
05:43 - string
05:45 - and
05:46 - make that equal to so i'll just write
05:48 - the
05:51 - array name
05:52 - and
05:53 - i'll just
05:55 - type the
05:57 - function that is content to string
06:01 - now
06:02 - the string
06:04 - variable
06:05 - is a string that contains the
06:09 - the
06:10 - the content of the string array
06:12 - converted to a string
06:14 - okay so content to string is a function
06:18 - that converts
06:19 - an array to an string
06:22 - now let's go ahead and
06:24 - print this
06:26 - string
06:28 - okay so when i run this function
06:37 - it prints hola this is programming
06:39 - knowledge but it shows that as an array
06:43 - why
06:45 - because we have converted it to string
06:46 - and string should be
06:48 - the value string should be an string
06:52 - so it isn't string but
06:54 - when i print this and also we can note
06:57 - that
06:58 - i have left spaces here so it also
07:00 - leaves spaces here
07:02 - so whatever i not leave spaces here
07:05 - so it automatically detects that
07:08 - that it should be a string with four
07:10 - different words or four different string
07:14 - so it automatically leaves the
07:16 - spaces out of there
07:18 - so when i
07:20 - want to print a particular string
07:22 - particular array of string
07:25 - so i'll just
07:27 - instead of doing all this i'll just
07:31 - write the print statement
07:34 - and in the print statement i'll write
07:35 - the string name and then content to
07:38 - string
07:39 - so when i write
07:41 - only the string array
07:43 - it does not print the
07:45 - array it prints that this is an array
07:47 - and it contains it contains string and
07:49 - the location of the array is this the
07:52 - location at which the arrow is stored is
07:54 - this
07:55 - so for printing the whole string array
07:58 - we use this
08:00 - okay so that's all for this video stay
08:02 - tuned

Cleaned transcript:

in the previous video we have discussed about arrays in kotlin and in this particular video we are going to learn about areas of string okay or an area of strings so i'll just go ahead and create a main function and inside the main function i will just create a variable string named string array and so if you remember for creating an array we have to use array of function and if we have to specify the data types we will use the less than and greater than sign and then we will use the open and close parenthesis and inside the open close parenthesis uh we will use the the the things that we have to add to this okay so uh i'll just create a string the array of string containing some strings so i'll just write hi this and again a string is and again string programming knowledge okay so it is a string it is an area of string containing four strings okay so specifically it is called an area of strings so what if i have to get a particular at a particular index so what if i have to get the string at a particular index so i can use a function that is the name of string that is string array and then dot get and then open and close parenthesis and then zero okay so what this function get does it does that it just gets the particular string at the particular index mentioned so when it shows a green line so when i go to it and hit alt plus enter it shows that replace get call with indexing operator and when i hit enter it chooses the open and close square box square bracket so the get function is the same as the square bracket that we used in the previous video okay so now if i just skip that and okay and uh so what if i have to change the change the string at a particular index so as i mentioned in the previous video what i have to do is write the name of the string that is write the name of the array and then use the square bracket and if i have to change the string at the zero index so i'll just write here hola okay so it changes the string at the zeroth index okay so when i print the string array what it does is so what happens when i print the whole array instead of printing a particular particular index of the array so it prints the this thing it prints l java lang string semicolon and this is an address so when i string when i print a particular array it it it shows that it is an array of containing strings and it shows its address that at this address the string is stored but it does not print that array so i'll just go ahead and print the zeroth element or the a string at element at index 0 so we can see that the string at particular index has changed now what if i have to get the size of a particular array so for getting the size of a particular array is we use the function dot size so i will just print write the print statement and then i'll write the string name sorry the array name and i'll just write dot size now when i run this program this the seventh line prints the size of an array okay and we can see that the size of an array is size of this array is four so that's correct now what if i have to make a whole string from an array of string like i have to make this a particular string so i'll just name a value that should be string and make that equal to so i'll just write the array name and i'll just type the function that is content to string now the string variable is a string that contains the the the content of the string array converted to a string okay so content to string is a function that converts an array to an string now let's go ahead and print this string okay so when i run this function it prints hola this is programming knowledge but it shows that as an array why because we have converted it to string and string should be the value string should be an string so it isn't string but when i print this and also we can note that i have left spaces here so it also leaves spaces here so whatever i not leave spaces here so it automatically detects that that it should be a string with four different words or four different string so it automatically leaves the spaces out of there so when i want to print a particular string particular array of string so i'll just instead of doing all this i'll just write the print statement and in the print statement i'll write the string name and then content to string so when i write only the string array it does not print the array it prints that this is an array and it contains it contains string and the location of the array is this the location at which the arrow is stored is this so for printing the whole string array we use this okay so that's all for this video stay tuned
