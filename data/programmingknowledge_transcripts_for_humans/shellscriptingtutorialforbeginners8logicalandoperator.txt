00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tool for beginners in
00:05 - this video we will learn how to use end
00:07 - operator with a statement so let's get
00:11 - started so suppose we have a student and
00:15 - we need to evaluate his age and we need
00:20 - to evaluate the age in such a way that
00:23 - his age should be greater than 18 and
00:27 - less than 30 years so how do we do it so
00:32 - let's say we have a student whose age is
00:36 - 25 right and then we will write an if
00:43 - statement so I'm going to write a if
00:45 - statement and then as we do with if
00:49 - statement we will just write the
00:52 - condition so we can write here age so
00:57 - dollar age and then we can say if age is
01:02 - greater than gt4 that with minor right
01:07 - so greater than 18 and we need to write
01:12 - the second condition also so for that we
01:16 - can use and operator and there are two
01:20 - ways of using app and operator with if
01:23 - statement in bash script one is to use
01:28 - these kind of four double and symbols
01:33 - and then make a second square bracket
01:37 - and then give our second condition here
01:39 - so the second condition is dollar age if
01:43 - the age is less than minus L T less than
01:47 - thirty right so we are evaluating two
01:51 - conditions here if the age is the
01:54 - greater than eighteen and the age is
01:56 - less than thirty then and then we will
01:59 - say success or fail so we will just echo
02:06 - valid age otherwise we will echo so let
02:11 - me write L and then we
02:13 - eko age not valid right and then we will
02:19 - end the eight condition by FY so
02:22 - whenever you want to evaluate more than
02:27 - one condition you can use two kinds of
02:30 - operators one is and operator and other
02:33 - is all operator
02:34 - which will be we will see in the next
02:36 - video right so in this case we want to
02:40 - check whether the age is greater than 18
02:42 - and if it's less than 30 at the same
02:46 - time so we use end operators and if you
02:50 - know little bit of programming you
02:52 - already know that and is for checking or
02:56 - validating both of the condition so if
02:59 - and only if both the conditions are true
03:04 - then only this code will be executed
03:07 - otherwise this code will be executed
03:09 - right so let me run the script so I'm
03:13 - going to go to my desktop folder so CD
03:17 - desktop and then I'm going to run my
03:20 - script and you can see age not valid
03:24 - right and why it's not valid because I
03:27 - think I forgot this space between 30 and
03:31 - the ending square bracket so we will run
03:34 - our script once again and this time it
03:37 - fails valid so always remember to give
03:40 - the space here and here okay so now
03:45 - let's give the age which is out of the
03:47 - range for example 50 year and let's see
03:50 - what happens so I'm going to run the
03:53 - script I'd say is age not valid and
03:56 - what's happening here the first
03:59 - condition is true because the age is
04:01 - greater than 18 so this condition is
04:05 - true but the other condition is false
04:08 - the age is not less than 30 right
04:11 - therefore the whole condition is false
04:16 - right in order to pass this and
04:19 - operators you need to pass both the
04:22 - condition this condition and this
04:24 - condition also right now
04:27 - there is a second way of using and
04:29 - operator and this way maybe is for some
04:34 - people it can be easier because it only
04:37 - requires one square bracket and not two
04:40 - square brackets so what we need to do is
04:43 - we can just remove these square bracket
04:46 - from here and then we can use a - a flag
04:51 - which stands for and okay so if you want
04:55 - to just use one square bracket then for
04:57 - an operator use - a flag and the
05:01 - condition or situation will be the same
05:04 - so - a stands for and operator and let's
05:07 - run the code once again and it's a age
05:10 - not valid and let's give the valid age
05:14 - and once again the age is valid now
05:19 - there is one last alternate way of using
05:22 - and operator with your if statement and
05:25 - that is you can use these double and
05:29 - operators like this but you need to use
05:32 - the double square brackets like this for
05:36 - that okay so if you want to use double
05:39 - square back brackets
05:41 - also you can use this kind of operator
05:43 - and it will also work fine so let's run
05:47 - the script once again it saves each
05:49 - valid and let's give the invalid age and
05:53 - let's run the script once again it says
05:56 - age not valid so there are three ways of
06:00 - using and operator one is this wave with
06:03 - two brackets and this and operator if
06:07 - you want to use one bracket then you
06:10 - need to use - a here and if you want to
06:15 - use two brackets then you can just give
06:19 - two conditions separately in two square
06:21 - brackets so in this way you can use end
06:25 - operators with if statement in scripting

hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tool for beginners in this video we will learn how to use end operator with a statement so let's get started so suppose we have a student and we need to evaluate his age and we need to evaluate the age in such a way that his age should be greater than 18 and less than 30 years so how do we do it so let's say we have a student whose age is 25 right and then we will write an if statement so I'm going to write a if statement and then as we do with if statement we will just write the condition so we can write here age so dollar age and then we can say if age is greater than gt4 that with minor right so greater than 18 and we need to write the second condition also so for that we can use and operator and there are two ways of using app and operator with if statement in bash script one is to use these kind of four double and symbols and then make a second square bracket and then give our second condition here so the second condition is dollar age if the age is less than minus L T less than thirty right so we are evaluating two conditions here if the age is the greater than eighteen and the age is less than thirty then and then we will say success or fail so we will just echo valid age otherwise we will echo so let me write L and then we eko age not valid right and then we will end the eight condition by FY so whenever you want to evaluate more than one condition you can use two kinds of operators one is and operator and other is all operator which will be we will see in the next video right so in this case we want to check whether the age is greater than 18 and if it's less than 30 at the same time so we use end operators and if you know little bit of programming you already know that and is for checking or validating both of the condition so if and only if both the conditions are true then only this code will be executed otherwise this code will be executed right so let me run the script so I'm going to go to my desktop folder so CD desktop and then I'm going to run my script and you can see age not valid right and why it's not valid because I think I forgot this space between 30 and the ending square bracket so we will run our script once again and this time it fails valid so always remember to give the space here and here okay so now let's give the age which is out of the range for example 50 year and let's see what happens so I'm going to run the script I'd say is age not valid and what's happening here the first condition is true because the age is greater than 18 so this condition is true but the other condition is false the age is not less than 30 right therefore the whole condition is false right in order to pass this and operators you need to pass both the condition this condition and this condition also right now there is a second way of using and operator and this way maybe is for some people it can be easier because it only requires one square bracket and not two square brackets so what we need to do is we can just remove these square bracket from here and then we can use a a flag which stands for and okay so if you want to just use one square bracket then for an operator use a flag and the condition or situation will be the same so a stands for and operator and let's run the code once again and it's a age not valid and let's give the valid age and once again the age is valid now there is one last alternate way of using and operator with your if statement and that is you can use these double and operators like this but you need to use the double square brackets like this for that okay so if you want to use double square back brackets also you can use this kind of operator and it will also work fine so let's run the script once again it saves each valid and let's give the invalid age and let's run the script once again it says age not valid so there are three ways of using and operator one is this wave with two brackets and this and operator if you want to use one bracket then you need to use a here and if you want to use two brackets then you can just give two conditions separately in two square brackets so in this way you can use end operators with if statement in scripting I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
