With timestamps:

00:00 - knowing yesterday we are going to learn
00:01 - about the top command Okay so before
00:03 - starting this video uh first of all let
00:05 - me tell you about the what is the top
00:06 - card okay so if you have learned about
00:09 - the PS command like which gives us the
00:12 - process States of uh like of our system
00:14 - similarly top command is also another
00:16 - command which lies under the process
00:18 - management okay we can get the uh
00:21 - information about the different
00:23 - processes like what is the PID of that
00:25 - particular process how much of memory is
00:28 - being used by that process okay we will
00:30 - see all the details and what are the
00:32 - users and what the users using that
00:34 - particular process so everything we are
00:36 - going to see about the in this
00:37 - particular video so we will start with
00:38 - the simple and basic command that is the
00:41 - top simple even you say top then it will
00:44 - show you the details about the other
00:46 - running different running processes by
00:48 - different users and all those things
00:49 - okay uh but before that let me just
00:51 - increase the size of my terminal I hope
00:54 - it is visible to you I'll just hit Top
00:56 - okay
00:58 - so here you can see uh the PID the what
01:01 - PID what does that mean I will tell you
01:03 - everything about the all these three
01:04 - what is these all things okay but before
01:07 - that I'll need to save it like this the
01:10 - screen and I will just open one command
01:12 - line also
01:13 - okay
01:15 - so here you can see what is the PID
01:18 - just Define the process ID like
01:22 - if you don't know about PID let me tell
01:24 - you like like every device has a unique
01:28 - Mac address similarly PID is just like
01:30 - that like it is it uniquely identifies
01:32 - each processes whatever the process is
01:35 - created by the user then
01:37 - the our system assigns some PID to that
01:40 - particular process to uniquely identify
01:42 - that process simulate that is the
01:45 - process ID okay moving forward if you
01:49 - will see the user so user section just
01:51 - defines like who is the user
01:56 - using that particular
01:59 - process
02:01 - don't give attention on scaling mistakes
02:04 - okay that is not important here right
02:06 - now so what is PR pla just uh like
02:10 - private
02:11 - okay what is the priority of that
02:13 - command so the thing is that if though
02:16 - your what we say the number is lower so
02:19 - it should have the higher probability
02:21 - here you can see the zero so these
02:24 - processors have should have higher
02:25 - priority
02:26 - okay like you can see 20 minus 51 so it
02:30 - is you can see
02:32 - 2020 everything is there like so here
02:35 - you can write the lower the number
02:40 - higher the priority
02:43 - what does priority mean basically like
02:45 - this process like what if something
02:47 - happens to the more priority command or
02:50 - more priority process then the CPU users
02:53 - should like not CPU use it
02:57 - just think like example Suppose there
02:59 - are two processes A and B and uh B the
03:04 - priority of B is low but priority of a
03:06 - is high okay if some Interruption
03:08 - happens with hidden then a can use more
03:12 - CPU uses you can say like that okay so
03:16 - this is the defines the pr like what is
03:18 - the priority of that particular process
03:20 - of command
03:21 - and for the UK you will see here it is v
03:24 - i r t which really defines the
03:27 - virtual memory used by the task okay it
03:32 - is I think it's in KB it is in KB okay
03:36 - so that's why it's showing like bigger
03:38 - number
03:40 - okay so it is virtually you can say was
03:44 - not virtually virtual memory
03:46 - used by the task okay
03:50 - moving forward what is this res
03:54 - what we can say
03:56 - I think it is a physical RAM yeah the
03:59 - command used like whatever the process
04:02 - is running like how much RAM this is
04:04 - particularly using like this particular
04:06 - process how much RAM it is using here is
04:08 - also in the KB
04:10 - this data is in KB okay and moving
04:14 - forward if you will talk about the shr
04:16 - so shr is nothing but a shared memory it
04:19 - also in KB
04:21 - okay and then the percentage CPU
04:23 - percentage memory time and what are the
04:26 - other option you can see here uh
04:28 - where it is time plus command all those
04:32 - things like this is this uh this shows
04:34 - the
04:35 - uh which command uh like after entering
04:39 - which command this process is running
04:41 - okay
04:42 - so here you can see all those things
04:44 - okay if I will just
04:46 - yeah wait a minute
04:48 - what I will do first I will just stop
04:51 - this stop command
04:52 - and I will again run that top command
04:55 - and I will show you one thing okay so
04:57 - here you can see the top command is
04:59 - running
04:59 - okay like different processes coming
05:02 - here and there okay now what I will do
05:05 - uh but command is not visible let me
05:08 - just to increase this one yeah yeah now
05:10 - you can see the command is visible
05:12 - if I do Ctrl alt T and I will hit this
05:15 - five box
05:16 - okay so this command what it will do it
05:18 - will just create a new process okay and
05:21 - then again you can see here if I will
05:24 - hit enter in that particular terminal
05:25 - then Firefox will come up there and some
05:29 - PID will be assigned to that so here you
05:31 - can see which command is this Firefox
05:34 - and a particular time you can see how
05:36 - much CPU uses per memory plus virtual
05:39 - memory
05:40 - okay and RAM also and who is the user I
05:44 - use is the user and the PID is 4790
05:48 - okay
05:50 - so in this way this particular
05:52 - popcorn Works which displays you the
05:55 - particular information about any
05:58 - particular
05:59 - process okay
06:01 - so now what we have to do uh if you want
06:03 - to just what you can see you can say
06:06 - like if you want to get information
06:08 - about the particular user like uh so
06:11 - let's suppose I want to get information
06:13 - about the IU sugar word process being
06:16 - used by that particular user so I can
06:18 - use those command also okay but before
06:20 - moving to that uh I will just tell you
06:23 - one thing like if you want to kill any
06:26 - process while using top command how you
06:28 - can do it you have to just in this
06:30 - particular terminal
06:31 - uh let me just increase this one okay
06:35 - uh
06:36 - where it is
06:40 - I think this one
06:43 - this one
06:45 - Firefox is running Firefox PID is what
06:47 - four seven ninety now what I do here we
06:49 - just hit k so when you will enter K so
06:53 - here you can see PID to Signal default
06:55 - PID is one six two two so here you can
06:58 - do it uh like enter the PID of the
07:01 - process which you want to kill or which
07:03 - you want to close so if I search for
07:05 - Firefox
07:07 - I think it was four seven nine zero
07:12 - okay so let me just
07:17 - shape like this
07:19 - okay uh yeah here you can see four seven
07:23 - nine zero is some process
07:27 - let me just take this one
07:30 - the weight of it
07:33 - so four seven nine zero not able to see
07:36 - 479 here you can see 4790 is this one so
07:39 - I'll just hit K and I will write enter
07:41 - four seven nine zero enter and here you
07:44 - can see the what happens when you kill
07:46 - the command uh it's not command can you
07:49 - kill the process then you need to give
07:51 - the particular signal so in this case
07:53 - I'll hit 15 so
07:55 - you can see like Firefox has been closed
07:58 - and also here you can see the terminated
08:01 - okay
08:02 - so while I entered the p uh 15 because
08:06 - like it's kind of a signal which we use
08:09 - with the kill command okay
08:11 - so we will talk about the kill command
08:12 - in some another particular video okay
08:14 - now moving forward what uh I was telling
08:17 - about to get information about the
08:19 - password used by some particular user so
08:21 - how you can see you like how you can do
08:24 - that what you have to do you have to
08:25 - just need to talk
08:28 - hyphen U and the name of the user ayush
08:32 - and then here you can see all the
08:34 - processes which are being used by this
08:35 - particular user oh I think multiple
08:37 - processes are being used
08:40 - okay so in this way you can get
08:42 - information about particular user if you
08:45 - want to like if you work in the
08:47 - corporate world and you get like other
08:49 - units administrator then in that case it
08:52 - will be very useful like to know like
08:54 - which user is using what kind of
08:56 - processes when something happens then
08:58 - you can see
08:59 - okay and also there are multiple things
09:01 - like you can if you will hit Z then the
09:04 - running process color will get converted
09:07 - into this so what we what red color and
09:10 - if you will do this uh like what you can
09:13 - say if you press C
09:15 - then you will get the
09:17 - path of particular command like for
09:20 - which in which part that command is
09:22 - particularly running so here you can see
09:24 - the genome cell is in user bin directory
09:27 - and many more things here it is okay
09:31 - so that's all for today's videos guys I
09:33 - hope you liked it and if you have any
09:34 - queries then you can also in the comment
09:36 - section so thank you thank you for
09:37 - watching and I will meet you in the next
09:38 - video thank you

Cleaned transcript:

knowing yesterday we are going to learn about the top command Okay so before starting this video uh first of all let me tell you about the what is the top card okay so if you have learned about the PS command like which gives us the process States of uh like of our system similarly top command is also another command which lies under the process management okay we can get the uh information about the different processes like what is the PID of that particular process how much of memory is being used by that process okay we will see all the details and what are the users and what the users using that particular process so everything we are going to see about the in this particular video so we will start with the simple and basic command that is the top simple even you say top then it will show you the details about the other running different running processes by different users and all those things okay uh but before that let me just increase the size of my terminal I hope it is visible to you I'll just hit Top okay so here you can see uh the PID the what PID what does that mean I will tell you everything about the all these three what is these all things okay but before that I'll need to save it like this the screen and I will just open one command line also okay so here you can see what is the PID just Define the process ID like if you don't know about PID let me tell you like like every device has a unique Mac address similarly PID is just like that like it is it uniquely identifies each processes whatever the process is created by the user then the our system assigns some PID to that particular process to uniquely identify that process simulate that is the process ID okay moving forward if you will see the user so user section just defines like who is the user using that particular process don't give attention on scaling mistakes okay that is not important here right now so what is PR pla just uh like private okay what is the priority of that command so the thing is that if though your what we say the number is lower so it should have the higher probability here you can see the zero so these processors have should have higher priority okay like you can see 20 minus 51 so it is you can see 2020 everything is there like so here you can write the lower the number higher the priority what does priority mean basically like this process like what if something happens to the more priority command or more priority process then the CPU users should like not CPU use it just think like example Suppose there are two processes A and B and uh B the priority of B is low but priority of a is high okay if some Interruption happens with hidden then a can use more CPU uses you can say like that okay so this is the defines the pr like what is the priority of that particular process of command and for the UK you will see here it is v i r t which really defines the virtual memory used by the task okay it is I think it's in KB it is in KB okay so that's why it's showing like bigger number okay so it is virtually you can say was not virtually virtual memory used by the task okay moving forward what is this res what we can say I think it is a physical RAM yeah the command used like whatever the process is running like how much RAM this is particularly using like this particular process how much RAM it is using here is also in the KB this data is in KB okay and moving forward if you will talk about the shr so shr is nothing but a shared memory it also in KB okay and then the percentage CPU percentage memory time and what are the other option you can see here uh where it is time plus command all those things like this is this uh this shows the uh which command uh like after entering which command this process is running okay so here you can see all those things okay if I will just yeah wait a minute what I will do first I will just stop this stop command and I will again run that top command and I will show you one thing okay so here you can see the top command is running okay like different processes coming here and there okay now what I will do uh but command is not visible let me just to increase this one yeah yeah now you can see the command is visible if I do Ctrl alt T and I will hit this five box okay so this command what it will do it will just create a new process okay and then again you can see here if I will hit enter in that particular terminal then Firefox will come up there and some PID will be assigned to that so here you can see which command is this Firefox and a particular time you can see how much CPU uses per memory plus virtual memory okay and RAM also and who is the user I use is the user and the PID is 4790 okay so in this way this particular popcorn Works which displays you the particular information about any particular process okay so now what we have to do uh if you want to just what you can see you can say like if you want to get information about the particular user like uh so let's suppose I want to get information about the IU sugar word process being used by that particular user so I can use those command also okay but before moving to that uh I will just tell you one thing like if you want to kill any process while using top command how you can do it you have to just in this particular terminal uh let me just increase this one okay uh where it is I think this one this one Firefox is running Firefox PID is what four seven ninety now what I do here we just hit k so when you will enter K so here you can see PID to Signal default PID is one six two two so here you can do it uh like enter the PID of the process which you want to kill or which you want to close so if I search for Firefox I think it was four seven nine zero okay so let me just shape like this okay uh yeah here you can see four seven nine zero is some process let me just take this one the weight of it so four seven nine zero not able to see 479 here you can see 4790 is this one so I'll just hit K and I will write enter four seven nine zero enter and here you can see the what happens when you kill the command uh it's not command can you kill the process then you need to give the particular signal so in this case I'll hit 15 so you can see like Firefox has been closed and also here you can see the terminated okay so while I entered the p uh 15 because like it's kind of a signal which we use with the kill command okay so we will talk about the kill command in some another particular video okay now moving forward what uh I was telling about to get information about the password used by some particular user so how you can see you like how you can do that what you have to do you have to just need to talk hyphen U and the name of the user ayush and then here you can see all the processes which are being used by this particular user oh I think multiple processes are being used okay so in this way you can get information about particular user if you want to like if you work in the corporate world and you get like other units administrator then in that case it will be very useful like to know like which user is using what kind of processes when something happens then you can see okay and also there are multiple things like you can if you will hit Z then the running process color will get converted into this so what we what red color and if you will do this uh like what you can say if you press C then you will get the path of particular command like for which in which part that command is particularly running so here you can see the genome cell is in user bin directory and many more things here it is okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can also in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and I will meet you in the next video thank you
