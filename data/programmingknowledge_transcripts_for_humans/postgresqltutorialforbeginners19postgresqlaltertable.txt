00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:04 - you can modify or alter your table once
00:07 - you have created friends there may be
00:11 - some scenarios where once you have
00:14 - created your table after some time you
00:17 - need to do some modification needed so
00:20 - how you can perform those type of
00:22 - queries in Foursquare let us first
00:26 - understand understand which syntax
00:37 - perform with single and that pain first
00:42 - of all you can add a new column and you
00:56 - can also modify the data type of the
01:06 - corner so first let us understand how to
01:14 - add a new column the syntax is alter
01:25 - table the name of the table then add
01:36 - because you want to add something then
01:40 - the name of the column column name and
01:46 - the data type
01:52 - let's say it is same syntax first of all
01:56 - you need to write a return because you
01:58 - want to modify some changes then table
02:02 - then you specify the name of the table
02:05 - then add because you want to add
02:07 - something
02:09 - and they call them names that you want
02:11 - to add NZ the type of the card so let's
02:15 - so openly change me
02:19 - we have database test database
02:23 - okay so query tool now let us add some
02:30 - corner in our existing table here you
02:33 - can see we have employee table and
02:36 - student table in the student table we
02:40 - have only two columns roll number and
02:41 - name so let us add a new column last
02:46 - name instrument cable so alter because
02:50 - we want to alter the existing table
02:53 - table name of the table now we want to
02:59 - add something and the name of the column
03:07 - now I want to store only the initials
03:11 - only the first alphabet of the surname
03:13 - so our data type will begin ok so very
03:25 - different successfully ok so just you
03:29 - need to right-click on the table and
03:31 - refresh and we have a name here you can
03:39 - see roll number name and so this is how
03:44 - you can add a new column to existing tag
03:48 - also let us try to add a new column in
03:51 - every table is there okay so in my we
03:56 - have employee ID and employee name so
04:01 - let us add a standard column ok syntax
04:08 - will be the same data table the name of
04:13 - the tables is time we want to add
04:14 - something in employee so right
04:19 - the air name of the column and it will
04:29 - be okay okay
04:32 - altar table name of the temple in this
04:36 - case it will be improving we want to add
04:39 - something that's why we write ad here
04:41 - name of the new column that we want to
04:44 - add salary and the data type will be int
04:47 - okay so what very successful very firm
04:52 - just slightly refresh and you can see
04:55 - salary is there okay so this is how you
05:01 - can add new columns to add that way so
05:07 - now come to the drop now we can only we
05:13 - can not only add a ribbon we can also
05:16 - drop an existing column the syntax at a
05:20 - very similar alter table a table name
05:33 - now these things we want to drop
05:35 - something so right drop then we specify
05:41 - the column that we want to drop and
05:52 - that's it alter table name of the table
05:56 - drop because you want to drop or they
05:59 - did something and the name of the column
06:01 - you want to delete okay Jamie now let us
06:08 - try to remove this salary from the entry
06:12 - okay so alter table now the name of the
06:23 - table
06:26 - drop and the collar which will be sandy
06:34 - okay I'll turn table because we want to
06:37 - modify our alter see table then specify
06:40 - the name of the devil
06:42 - then drop and they say okay if I wear a
06:48 - written successfully just slightly from
06:50 - the head and refresh and you can say
06:52 - sellable people let us see one more
06:57 - example try to remove okay okay just
07:13 - right-click on and you can see roll
07:21 - number and name only okay so these that
07:23 - we can drop a column now let us come to
07:28 - the last point which is modify this data
07:33 - type of the column focus so alter table
07:41 - name of the table now we want to modify
07:50 - alter okay now which column we want to
07:56 - modify column name type is the key bar
08:05 - and the new data type let me type new
08:14 - data type here so that you will not
08:17 - confuse new data type okay alter table
08:22 - name of the table then again alter the
08:25 - name of the column you want to modify
08:27 - time because you want to quantify the
08:30 - teletype and your rated I hope we see
08:34 - Edmund again
08:37 - let us first of all I do not want to
08:40 - mess up with my existing column so let
08:44 - me insert a new column then later on we
08:46 - will change the data type okay to
08:49 - turntable table name of the table then
09:00 - again under sorry first we want to add
09:09 - now we BL and okay just like refresh and
09:18 - you can see now we will change be
09:22 - different so replace n with alter alter
09:28 - column name L name right and now I
09:35 - changed my mind I want to store entire
09:40 - surname instead of initials okay so
09:45 - right back that's a tenth of that and
09:52 - over where is it unsuccessfully such
09:56 - refresh in right click over here and go
10:01 - to properties in definition and you can
10:05 - see character very length of 10 its
10:08 - stage again let us see one more example
10:12 - this an employee
10:15 - okay we have parody in M let us try to
10:24 - insert a new column which will be middle
10:29 - M okay enter a one time of the devil
10:35 - will be afraid I am
10:42 - yeah okay
10:47 - difference let me show you the
10:51 - properties first of all and if you
10:54 - please character over length
10:55 - okay now I want to alter now can do this
11:06 - well let's say okay where it is
11:14 - successfully we refresh here M name go
11:20 - to properties definition and you can see
11:23 - they that I have exchange to work at 47
11:27 - length so this is how you can use alter
11:31 - query to perform various tasks in for
11:33 - stress thanks for watching it
