03:26 - on finish which is going to start the
03:28 - xampp server on my windows 11 operating
03:31 - system
03:32 - so you can see the xampp server
03:35 - control panel window has been started
03:38 - you can also open the xampp server from
03:42 - the list of all these apps on your
03:45 - windows 11 operating system so when you
03:47 - will scroll down here
03:49 - you will be able to see the zam server
03:52 - here under zamp folder okay so you can
03:56 - see this is the control panel which is
03:58 - opened right now so you can always uh go
04:01 - to your
04:03 - windows start menu and then
04:06 - open this sam server from here
04:08 - once the sam server is started you will
04:10 - see this kind of window also you will be
04:13 - able to see uh this icon which is
04:15 - created here which is for xampp server
04:17 - so it also indicates
04:19 - that xampp server is running so on this
04:22 - xampp control panel window you will be
04:25 - able to see all these modules the apache
04:28 - module mysql filezilla mercury and
04:31 - tomcat and you will be able to see some
04:33 - button in front of all these modules
04:37 - so
04:38 - the first section is for the start
04:40 - button or the stop buttons
04:42 - and then the next section is for the
04:45 - config button so you can configure all
04:48 - these modules using this config module
04:51 - and you can also see the individual logs
04:54 - of all these modules so if they have any
04:58 - errors you will be able to see in the
05:00 - logs right
05:01 - so let's start the apache server first
05:04 - of all so
05:05 - in front of apache i'm going to click on
05:07 - the start button which is going to start
05:10 - the apache server right
05:12 - once the apache server starts you will
05:14 - be able to see that
05:17 - here you will be able to see the green
05:20 - color around this apache that means
05:23 - everything is running successfully
05:25 - once the apache server is running you
05:27 - will be able to see the stop button for
05:30 - stopping
05:31 - the purchase server
05:33 - you will also see the pids so using
05:36 - these pids you know on which pids this
05:40 - apache server is running so if you want
05:43 - to force kill the purchase server you
05:45 - can use these pids right
05:48 - you can also see the config and logs
05:50 - which i'm going to cover little bit
05:53 - later you will also see these ports so
05:56 - these are the default ports on which the
05:59 - purchase server starts
06:01 - so if by chance these ports are not free
06:05 - on your windows 11 operating system then
06:08 - your apache server is going to show the
06:10 - error and i'm also going to show you how
06:12 - you can solve that error but first of
06:14 - all
06:16 - our apache server is running on port 80
06:18 - so we can go to our browser
06:21 - and then here i can just write
06:24 - local host and then press enter
06:28 - and if you see this kind of window that
06:30 - means apache server is running
06:32 - successfully on your windows 11
06:35 - operating system and it's working fine
06:38 - right so you can see i have opened the
06:41 - local host on which apache server is
06:44 - running and it has
06:45 - opened the dashboard on the apache
06:48 - server so everything is working fine for
06:51 - the apache server also in this
06:54 - web page you will be able to see this
06:56 - php my admin so when you click on the
06:58 - php my admin it should open the php my
07:02 - admin window
07:04 - but for now it's not going to show you
07:07 - the
07:08 - php my admin window and it's going to
07:10 - show you this error
07:12 - why it's showing this error because we
07:14 - haven't started our mysql server here
07:17 - right
07:18 - so you can see mysql is not started so
07:21 - we have to start
07:22 - mysql in order to
07:24 - see the phpmyadmin interface so let me
07:28 - just click on the start button here
07:31 - and then i'm going to click on allow
07:32 - access here and now you can see my mysql
07:36 - server is also running on port
07:39 - 3306
07:40 - and i can stop this mysql server at any
07:44 - time now my mysql server is running so
07:47 - i'm going to refresh this webpage once
07:49 - again for phpmyadmin
07:52 - and you will see that this php my admin
07:55 - window
07:56 - and it's going to show you this kind of
07:58 - interface that means uh your php myadmin
08:03 - is also working from here you can create
08:05 - databases
08:07 - you can run sql queries and do many
08:10 - things related to your database right
08:15 - so
08:15 - that's running
08:17 - now remember i have told you that if
08:20 - this port 80 is already occupied on
08:24 - your windows operating system by some
08:26 - other service this apache server is
08:28 - going to show you some errors so first
08:31 - of all how you can check which ports are
08:34 - already occupied on your windows 11
08:37 - operating system
08:38 - so xampp control panel comes with this
08:41 - netstat tool so when you click on this
08:44 - netstat button
08:46 - it's going to show you the list of all
08:48 - the ports which are occupied on your
08:52 - windows 11 operating system so you can
08:54 - see port 80 is occupied right now by my
08:58 - apache server
08:59 - but let's say if it's occupied by some
09:01 - other service
09:03 - it's also going to show you the name of
09:05 - that service right
09:07 - similarly you can see mysql is running
09:11 - on port 3306
09:14 - and you can see all the other ports
09:16 - which
09:17 - are occupied on your windows 11
09:19 - operating system
09:21 - with all these services right so let's
09:24 - say this port 80 is already occupied so
09:27 - i want to change this port of apache
09:30 - server
09:31 - so for changing this port you just need
09:34 - to stop your apache server first of all
09:37 - and then click on config here so for the
09:40 - configuration you can choose the first
09:42 - option which is
09:43 - httpd.conf file so i'm going to click on
09:46 - the first option
09:48 - which is going to open this kind of file
09:50 - so on this http.conf file
09:53 - just scroll down a little
09:55 - until you see this listen keyword right
10:00 - so you can see the default port right
10:02 - now is 80
10:04 - i can change this port to something else
10:06 - so let's say i want to change this port
10:09 - to port 8080 8080 right i can also
10:14 - change this but it will not
10:17 - change anything because you can see this
10:20 - line is commented
10:21 - right so you need to change this port in
10:25 - order to change the port of your apache
10:27 - server and then just save this file by
10:30 - pressing ctrl s and then you can close
10:33 - this file
10:34 - once that's done you can once again
10:36 - start your apache server so click on the
10:39 - start button
10:40 - and this time you will see that now the
10:43 - port of apache is changed to port 8080
10:48 - in my case right so this is how you can
10:51 - change the port
10:53 - now once again when you go to your
10:56 - browser and
10:57 - type localhost here this time it's not
11:01 - going to open
11:03 - because
11:04 - now our server is running on the
11:06 - different port right so if the port is
11:09 - 80 on your windows operating system you
11:13 - don't need to provide any port
11:15 - information on the browser but if you
11:18 - change the port from port 80 to some
11:21 - other port in our case we have changed
11:23 - it to port 8080 i need to add this colon
11:28 - and then
11:29 - add the port number in my case it's port
11:33 - 8080 and then press enter
11:36 - and then only it's going to open right
11:39 - so you need to write the port number
11:42 - after the local host in order to open
11:45 - this
11:46 - web page if you changed the port here so
11:50 - the port should be similar which is
11:52 - visible here on this browser after local
11:56 - host
11:57 - similarly
11:58 - this php my admin is also not going to
12:01 - work right why it's not going to work
12:04 - because you guessed it right you need to
12:07 - add colon
12:08 - 8080 after the local host and then press
12:12 - enter and then it's going to work
12:14 - normally right
12:16 - so
12:18 - if you change the port here you need to
12:20 - change the url also here so this is how
12:23 - you can download and install and use
12:26 - xampp server on your windows 11
12:28 - operating system
12:30 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
12:32 - will see you in the next video

local host on which apache server is running and it has opened the dashboard on the apache server so everything is working fine for the apache server also in this web page you will be able to see this php my admin so when you click on the php my admin it should open the php my admin window but for now it's not going to show you the php my admin window and it's going to show you this error why it's showing this error because we haven't started our mysql server here right so you can see mysql is not started so we have to start mysql in order to see the phpmyadmin interface so let me just click on the start button here and then i'm going to click on allow access here and now you can see my mysql server is also running on port 3306 and i can stop this mysql server at any time now my mysql server is running so i'm going to refresh this webpage once again for phpmyadmin and you will see that this php my admin window and it's going to show you this kind of interface that means uh your php myadmin is also working from here you can create databases you can run sql queries and do many things related to your database right so that's running now remember i have told you that if this port 80 is already occupied on your windows operating system by some other service this apache server is going to show you some errors so first of all how you can check which ports are already occupied on your windows 11 operating system so xampp control panel comes with this netstat tool so when you click on this netstat button it's going to show you the list of all the ports which are occupied on

save this file by pressing ctrl s and then you can close this file once that's done you can once again start your apache server so click on the start button and this time you will see that now the port of apache is changed to port 8080 in my case right so this is how you can change the port now once again when you go to your browser and type localhost here this time it's not going to open because now our server is running on the different port right so if the port is 80 on your windows operating system you don't need to provide any port information on the browser but if you change the port from port 80 to some other port in our case we have changed it to port 8080 i need to add this colon and then add the port number in my case it's port 8080 and then press enter and then only it's going to open right so you need to write the port number after the local host in order to open this web page if you changed the port here so the port should be similar which is visible here on this browser after local host similarly this php my admin is also not going to work right why it's not going to work because you guessed it right you need to add colon 8080 after the local host and then press enter and then it's going to work normally right so if you change the port here you need to change the url also here so this is how you can download and install and use xampp server on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
