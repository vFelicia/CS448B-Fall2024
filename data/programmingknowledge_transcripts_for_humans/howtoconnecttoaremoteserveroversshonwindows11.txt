00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can connect to a remote
00:04 - machine using SSH on your windows 11
00:08 - operating system
00:10 - so for example I want to connect to a
00:13 - remote server using SSH and I want to
00:17 - access all the file system or run some
00:19 - commands on that remote server how can I
00:23 - do it on my Windows operating system
00:25 - let's see
00:26 - so Windows 11 already comes with the
00:31 - Powershell utility and this Powershell
00:33 - already have the SSH client installed
00:37 - and to check that you can just search
00:40 - for
00:41 - Powershell here and then open Powershell
00:44 - so just open the Powershell for example
00:47 - and once Powershell is open just write
00:49 - this command SSH here and then press
00:52 - enter
00:53 - and it's going to give you this kind of
00:56 - output which is usage and then SSH and
01:00 - then it's going to give you some help
01:03 - Flags here which you can use to connect
01:06 - to the remote server
01:08 - so once you see this kind of output that
01:12 - means SSH client is already there on
01:15 - your Windows operating system and you
01:17 - can use Powershell to connect to any
01:20 - remote server over SSH
01:23 - now for the demonstration purposes I
01:26 - have this virtual machine setup
01:29 - and this virtual machine already have
01:32 - open SSH server running on it
01:35 - and I want to connect to this virtual
01:37 - machine using my Windows operating
01:40 - system and access all the file systems
01:42 - and access basically everything in this
01:46 - remote server right it can be any remote
01:49 - server in your case
01:52 - now in order to check whether
01:55 - SSH is running on your remote server the
01:59 - command is really simple it's pseudo
02:02 - system CTL status SSH just run this
02:05 - command on your remote server and then
02:07 - give your password and if it says active
02:10 - running that means open SSH server is
02:13 - running on that
02:15 - server and you can connect to this
02:19 - remote server over SSH
02:22 - now in order to connect to this virtual
02:27 - machine let me clear the terminal
02:29 - you just need to know the username and
02:32 - IP address of your remote machine and
02:35 - hopefully the password to log into your
02:37 - machine right
02:39 - so the username here is code bind in my
02:42 - case just know the username of your
02:45 - remote machine right
02:47 - in order to know the IP address uh for
02:52 - this demonstration I can give if config
02:55 - command here
02:56 - because this is just a virtual machine
02:58 - running locally on my system right
03:01 - so you can see this is the IP address
03:05 - right now so I can just connect to this
03:10 - virtual machine using this IP address in
03:13 - your case it can be the IP address or
03:15 - the host name of your remote machine so
03:18 - I know the IP address I know the
03:20 - username and I also know the password of
03:22 - this remote operating system then on
03:26 - your Powershell you just need to give
03:28 - this command just write SSH and then the
03:32 - username in my case as I said username
03:34 - is code bind so I'm going to give
03:37 - the username here at the rate IP address
03:40 - so in my case the remote machines IP
03:43 - address is this so I'm going to give
03:45 - disk IP address which is 192.168.152.128
03:53 - and then my open SSH server is running
03:56 - on the default Port which is uh 22 the
04:00 - default port for open SSH is 22. if this
04:05 - default Port is different on your remote
04:08 - server then you can give hyphen p and
04:11 - then the port number of that remote
04:15 - server right in my case I don't need to
04:19 - give any IP address because I am running
04:21 - open SSS server on this virtual machine
04:23 - on the default Port which is 22. you can
04:27 - also give 22 which is essentially going
04:31 - to connect to Port 22 but if you don't
04:35 - give this hyphen P20 to uh command also
04:40 - it will work right I will press enter
04:44 - here and then you will see this kind of
04:47 - output which says the authority of host
04:50 - this can't be established uh key
04:54 - fingerprint is this one this key is not
04:57 - known by any other names are you sure
04:59 - you want to continue connecting I just
05:02 - need to type yes here and then press
05:04 - enter which is going to ask me for my
05:07 - virtual machine or remote server's
05:10 - password right so you need to give the
05:12 - password of this remote machine which
05:16 - you use to log into your remote machine
05:21 - so let me give that password
05:24 - and then press enter
05:26 - and I think I try
05:29 - and I think I just typed wrong passwords
05:32 - let me retry again and then this time
05:35 - hopefully it works and it works you see
05:37 - now I can see
05:40 - username is code bind which is same here
05:44 - right so now I'm connected remotely to
05:48 - my remote operating system over SSH
05:53 - so let's try something so let me clear
05:56 - the terminal here let me clear
05:59 - the terminal here also and if I do LS
06:03 - here I will see similar kind of outputs
06:06 - uh or similar kind of folders and files
06:10 - which I will see here when I try to give
06:14 - LS commands command here right so you
06:17 - can see all files and folders are same
06:20 - as my remote machine so essentially what
06:24 - I'm doing here is I'm just accessing
06:28 - this remote machine over ssh in this
06:33 - Powershell right so everything you see
06:36 - on your remote machine you will have the
06:39 - access to that in your SSH connection
06:43 - right
06:44 - so now you can do uh any tasks or you
06:50 - can perform any uh command in this
06:53 - Powershell and it will run on your
06:57 - remote system
06:58 - so that's how you can connect to a
07:02 - remote
07:03 - server or remote machine over SSH using
07:08 - Windows 11. I hope you enjoyed this
07:10 - video and I will see you in the next
07:12 - video

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can connect to a remote machine using SSH on your windows 11 operating system so for example I want to connect to a remote server using SSH and I want to access all the file system or run some commands on that remote server how can I do it on my Windows operating system let's see so Windows 11 already comes with the Powershell utility and this Powershell already have the SSH client installed and to check that you can just search for Powershell here and then open Powershell so just open the Powershell for example and once Powershell is open just write this command SSH here and then press enter and it's going to give you this kind of output which is usage and then SSH and then it's going to give you some help Flags here which you can use to connect to the remote server so once you see this kind of output that means SSH client is already there on your Windows operating system and you can use Powershell to connect to any remote server over SSH now for the demonstration purposes I have this virtual machine setup and this virtual machine already have open SSH server running on it and I want to connect to this virtual machine using my Windows operating system and access all the file systems and access basically everything in this remote server right it can be any remote server in your case now in order to check whether SSH is running on your remote server the command is really simple it's pseudo system CTL status SSH just run this command on your remote server and then give your password and if it says active running that means open SSH server is running on that server and you can connect to this remote server over SSH now in order to connect to this virtual machine let me clear the terminal you just need to know the username and IP address of your remote machine and hopefully the password to log into your machine right so the username here is code bind in my case just know the username of your remote machine right in order to know the IP address uh for this demonstration I can give if config command here because this is just a virtual machine running locally on my system right so you can see this is the IP address right now so I can just connect to this virtual machine using this IP address in your case it can be the IP address or the host name of your remote machine so I know the IP address I know the username and I also know the password of this remote operating system then on your Powershell you just need to give this command just write SSH and then the username in my case as I said username is code bind so I'm going to give the username here at the rate IP address so in my case the remote machines IP address is this so I'm going to give disk IP address which is 192.168.152.128 and then my open SSH server is running on the default Port which is uh 22 the default port for open SSH is 22. if this default Port is different on your remote server then you can give hyphen p and then the port number of that remote server right in my case I don't need to give any IP address because I am running open SSS server on this virtual machine on the default Port which is 22. you can also give 22 which is essentially going to connect to Port 22 but if you don't give this hyphen P20 to uh command also it will work right I will press enter here and then you will see this kind of output which says the authority of host this can't be established uh key fingerprint is this one this key is not known by any other names are you sure you want to continue connecting I just need to type yes here and then press enter which is going to ask me for my virtual machine or remote server's password right so you need to give the password of this remote machine which you use to log into your remote machine so let me give that password and then press enter and I think I try and I think I just typed wrong passwords let me retry again and then this time hopefully it works and it works you see now I can see username is code bind which is same here right so now I'm connected remotely to my remote operating system over SSH so let's try something so let me clear the terminal here let me clear the terminal here also and if I do LS here I will see similar kind of outputs uh or similar kind of folders and files which I will see here when I try to give LS commands command here right so you can see all files and folders are same as my remote machine so essentially what I'm doing here is I'm just accessing this remote machine over ssh in this Powershell right so everything you see on your remote machine you will have the access to that in your SSH connection right so now you can do uh any tasks or you can perform any uh command in this Powershell and it will run on your remote system so that's how you can connect to a remote server or remote machine over SSH using Windows 11. I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
