00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install PyCharm
00:04 - on your open to operating system so
00:07 - let's get started so first of all what
00:10 - you need to install PyCharm is obviously
00:13 - python and python comes pre-installed on
00:17 - your latest version of ubuntu operating
00:19 - system so in order to check it you can
00:22 - just open the terminal and then type
00:26 - python 3 here and then press enter and
00:29 - you can see this is the version which is
00:33 - installed on my open to operating system
00:36 - so let me minimize this terminal and
00:39 - let's see how we can install PyCharm on
00:41 - ubuntu so first of all open your
00:44 - favorite browser and search for PyCharm
00:47 - here and the first link which will
00:49 - appear here will be from JetBrains comm
00:53 - /pi charm so we are going to click on
00:56 - this link and now once you are on this
00:58 - JetBrains comm website you will be able
01:01 - to see the spy charm icon here and you
01:05 - will be able to see this kind of
01:07 - download now' button so you just need to
01:10 - click on this download now' button so
01:12 - here you can see linux is automatically
01:14 - selected because this website has
01:17 - already detected that we are working on
01:19 - a linux operating system so it
01:21 - automatically selects linux for us and
01:25 - once we scroll down here you will be
01:29 - able to see two options to download and
01:31 - install pi chum one is the professional
01:35 - version and the other is the community
01:37 - version the community version is free
01:40 - and open source which means you don't
01:42 - need to pay anything to use it the
01:45 - professional version comes with more
01:48 - features but you need to buy this from
01:51 - jetbrains
01:52 - so for now I want to install the
01:54 - community version of Pi charm so I will
01:57 - just click on the Downloads button under
01:59 - the community section and this is going
02:01 - to start the download of this pycharm
02:04 - community dot tarnod gz file so i'm
02:08 - going to save it on my open to operating
02:11 - system so now this star dot gz
02:13 - file is downloaded on my uber new
02:15 - operating system so I'm going to just go
02:17 - to the location where it's downloaded
02:20 - and you can see this Python community
02:21 - tar dot G that file is downloaded on our
02:24 - system so to untie this tar dot G that
02:27 - file you can just right click here and
02:29 - then you can say extract here you can
02:33 - also use the tar command to unter this
02:36 - file so once you have extracted this
02:39 - directory from your tar file you just
02:41 - need to go inside it and you will be
02:43 - able to see this kind of folder
02:45 - structure here now the file we are
02:48 - interested in is inside this bin
02:51 - directory so we are going to go inside
02:53 - this bin directory and the file in which
02:56 - we are interested in is called pycharm
02:59 - dot s h so we need to run this file in
03:03 - order to install a PyCharm
03:04 - so in order to run this file you can
03:07 - open your terminal by pressing ctrl alt
03:10 - T and your terminal will open so first
03:13 - of all we are going to CD to our
03:16 - downloads folder where we have extracted
03:19 - the star file and I'm going to do LS
03:22 - here and you can see we need to go
03:25 - inside this PyCharm community directory
03:27 - so I'm going to once again see the
03:29 - PyCharm community and then we need to go
03:32 - inside the bin directory inside this
03:35 - PyCharm community directory so now I am
03:38 - in the bin directory of this pycharm
03:41 - community directory so I'm going to just
03:44 - give the LS command to list out all the
03:46 - files here and this is the file which we
03:49 - want to run so to run this file you need
03:51 - to just write dot /pi charm dot SH and
03:56 - then press Enter
03:57 - which is going to run the pycharm
04:00 - installer so once you run this pycharm
04:03 - dot SH file you can see the installation
04:05 - of pycharm will start and the first
04:08 - question it ask us is whether we want to
04:12 - import any settings from the previous
04:14 - installation of pycharm or not so we
04:17 - don't have any previous version of
04:19 - pycharm so I will leave this as default
04:22 - which is do not import settings and
04:25 - click OK and let me minimize this
04:26 - terminal also
04:27 - and this directory also and you can see
04:30 - the installation of pycharm has been
04:32 - started and here you need to read these
04:36 - license terms and conditions from
04:39 - jetbrains
04:40 - and if you agree with all these license
04:42 - terms and conditions you can click on
04:44 - the accept button and now you will see
04:47 - this data sharing window I will just say
04:49 - don't send and on this window it says
04:52 - customize pycharm you get to choose the
04:54 - theme which you want for your pie charm
04:58 - so by default this dark color theme is
05:01 - selected if you want the intelligent
05:03 - eeeem you can just select it from here
05:05 - or gtk+ theme you can select from here
05:08 - so I'm going to choose the intellij
05:10 - theme and now I will click Launch a
05:13 - script which is the next button on this
05:15 - next window you will see this create
05:17 - launcher script option and the default
05:20 - path for that is this one so I'm going
05:24 - to leave everything as default and I
05:26 - will click Next here and these are all
05:28 - the featured plugins which you can
05:30 - install but for now I don't want to
05:33 - install any plug-in I will just say
05:35 - start using PyCharm and click this
05:37 - button which is going to start the
05:40 - PyCharm so now PyCharm has been started
05:43 - on my urban to operating system so in
05:45 - order to create a new python project you
05:48 - can click on the create new project and
05:51 - here you just need to give the name of
05:54 - your project at the end so let me name
05:57 - my project as hello world and i'm going
06:00 - to just click on create and now my
06:02 - project has been created and the first
06:05 - thing i see here is this option which
06:08 - says welcome to pycharm which is the tip
06:11 - of the day i'm going to close this
06:12 - window and you can see on the left hand
06:15 - side this hello world project is created
06:18 - so now we are going to create a dot py
06:21 - file which is a python file by
06:23 - right-clicking on our project and then
06:25 - new and then select python file and here
06:28 - you need to give any name to your file
06:31 - so I'm going to name my file as hello
06:34 - and you don't need to give any extension
06:37 - here because you have chosen Python file
06:39 - the pycharm will autumn
06:41 - technically add this dot py extension to
06:44 - this hello file so I'm going to click on
06:46 - OK and you can see this hello dot py
06:49 - file is created for us so let me
06:52 - maximize this IDE and now let's print
06:56 - something so I'm going to just write

07:00 - print hello world so I'm going to just
07:02 - right in between the double quotes hello
07:05 - world and if you see this warning which
07:08 - says no Python interpreter configured
07:11 - for the project you can just click on
07:14 - this link which says configure python
07:16 - interpreter and from here you can choose
07:19 - the Python interpreter which is by
07:21 - default in my case python 3.6 which
07:24 - comes pre-installed on my ubuntu
07:27 - operating system so you can choose the
07:30 - version of python which is installed on
07:32 - your boon 2 operating system and then
