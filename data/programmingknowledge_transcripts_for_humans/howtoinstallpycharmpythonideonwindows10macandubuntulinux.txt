15:08 - you how you can install pycharm
15:10 - on your open to operating system so
15:14 - let's get started so first of all what
15:17 - you need to install PyCharm is obviously
15:19 - python and python comes pre-installed on
15:24 - your latest version of ubuntu operating
15:26 - system so in order to check it you can

15:33 - python 3 here and then press enter and
15:36 - you can see this is the version which is
15:39 - installed on my open to operating system
15:43 - so let me minimize this terminal and
15:45 - let's see how we can install PyCharm on
15:48 - ubuntu so first of all open your
15:50 - favorite browser and search for PyCharm
15:54 - here and the first link which will
15:55 - appear here will be from JetBrains comm
15:59 - /pi charm so we are going to click on
16:02 - this link and now once you are on this
16:05 - JetBrains comm website you will be able
16:08 - to see the spy charm icon here and you
16:12 - will be able to see this kind of
16:14 - download now' button so you just need to
16:16 - click on this download now' button so
16:18 - here you can see linux is automatically
16:21 - selected because this website has
16:23 - already detected that we are working on
16:26 - a linux operating system so it
16:28 - automatically selects linux for us and
16:32 - once we scroll down here you will be
16:35 - able to see two options to download and
16:37 - install pi chum one is the professional
16:41 - version and the other is the community
16:44 - version the community version is free
16:47 - and open source which means you don't
16:49 - need to pay anything to use it the
16:52 - professional version comes with more
16:54 - features but you need to buy this from
16:57 - jetbrains
16:58 - so for now i want to install the
17:00 - community version of pi charm so i will
17:03 - just click on the Downloads button under
17:05 - the community section and this is going
17:08 - to start the download of this pycharm
17:10 - community dot tarnod gz file so i'm
17:14 - going to save it on my open to operating
17:17 - system so now this star dot
17:19 - that file is downloaded on my bun to
17:22 - operating system so I'm going to just go
17:24 - to the location where it's downloaded
17:26 - and you can see this Python community
17:28 - tar dot G that file is downloaded on our
17:31 - system so to untie this tar dot G that
17:34 - file you can just right click here and
17:36 - then you can say extract here you can
17:39 - also use the tar command to untie this
17:42 - file so once you have extracted this
17:45 - directory from your tar file you just
17:47 - need to go inside it and you will be
17:50 - able to see this kind of folder
17:52 - structure here now the file we are
17:54 - interested in is inside this bin
17:58 - directory so we are going to go inside
18:00 - this bin directory and the file in which
18:02 - we are interested in is called PyCharm
18:05 - dot s H so we need to run this file in
18:09 - order to install a PyCharm
18:11 - so in order to run this file you can
18:13 - open your terminal by pressing ctrl alt
18:16 - T and your terminal will open so first
18:20 - of all we are going to CD to our
18:22 - downloads folder where we have extracted
18:25 - the star file and I'm going to do LS
18:29 - here and you can see we need to go
18:31 - inside this pycharm community directory
18:34 - so I'm going to once again see the
18:36 - PyCharm community and then we need to go
18:39 - inside the binner directory inside this
18:42 - PyCharm community directory so now I am
18:45 - in the bin directory of this pycharm
18:47 - community directory so I'm going to just
18:50 - give the LS command to list out all the
18:53 - files here and this is the file which we
18:55 - want to run so to run this file you need
18:58 - to just write dot /pi charm dot SH and
19:03 - then press Enter which is going to run
19:05 - the PyCharm installer so once you run
19:08 - this pycharm dot Sh file you can see the
19:11 - installation of pycharm will start and
19:14 - the first question it ask us is whether
19:17 - we want to import any settings from the
19:20 - previous installation of pycharm or not
19:23 - so we don't have any previous version of
19:26 - PyCharm so I will leave this as default
19:29 - which is do not import settings and
19:31 - click OK and let me minimize this term
19:33 - also and this directory also and you can
19:36 - see the installation of pycharm has been
19:39 - started and here you need to read these
19:42 - license terms and conditions from

20:09 - eeeem you can just select it from here
20:11 - or gtk+ theme you can select from here
20:14 - so I'm going to choose the IntelliJ
20:16 - theme and now I will click launcher
20:19 - script which is the next button on this
20:22 - next window you will see this create
20:24 - launcher script option and the default
20:27 - path for that is this one so I'm going
20:30 - to leave everything as default and I
20:33 - will click Next here and these are all
20:35 - the featured plugins which you can
20:37 - install but for now I don't want to
20:40 - install any plug-in I will just say

20:55 - can click on the create new project and
20:58 - here you just need to give the name of
21:00 - your project at the end so let me name
21:03 - my project as HelloWorld and I'm going

21:09 - project has been created and the first
21:11 - thing I see here is this option which
21:14 - says welcome to pycharm
21:16 - which is the tip of the day I'm going to
21:18 - close this window and you can see on the
21:21 - left hand side this hello world project
21:24 - is created so now we are going to create
21:26 - a dot py file which is a Python file by
21:30 - right-clicking on our project and then
21:31 - new and then select python file and here
21:35 - you need to give any name to your file
21:38 - so I'm going to name my file as hello
21:41 - and you don't need to give any extension
21:43 - here because you have chosen Python file
21:45 - the pycharm will autumn
21:47 - we add this dot py extension to this
21:51 - hello file so I'm going to click on OK
21:53 - and you can see this hello dot py file
21:56 - is created for us so let me maximize
21:58 - this IDE and now let's print something
22:03 - so I'm going to just write print and

say extract here you can also use the tar command to untie this file so once you have extracted this directory from your tar file you just need to go inside it and you will be able to see this kind of folder structure here now the file we are interested in is inside this bin directory so we are going to go inside this bin directory and the file in which we are interested in is called PyCharm dot s H so we need to run this file in order to install a PyCharm so in order to run this file you can open your terminal by pressing ctrl alt T and your terminal will open so first of all we are going to CD to our downloads folder where we have extracted the star file and I'm going to do LS here and you can see we need to go inside this pycharm community directory so I'm going to once again see the

the PyCharm installer so once you run this pycharm dot Sh file you can see the installation of pycharm will start and the first question it ask us is whether we want to import any settings from the

and this directory also and you can see the installation of pycharm has been started and here you need to read these license terms and conditions from JetBrains and if you agree with all these license terms and conditions you can click on the accept button and now you will see this data sharing window I will just say don't send and on this window it says customize PyCharm you get to choose the

parentheses let's print hello world so I'm going to just write in between the double quotes hello world and if you see this warning which says no Python interpreter configured for the project you can just click on this link which says configure python interpreter and from here you can choose the Python interpreter which is by default in my case python 3.6 which comes preinstalled on my open to
