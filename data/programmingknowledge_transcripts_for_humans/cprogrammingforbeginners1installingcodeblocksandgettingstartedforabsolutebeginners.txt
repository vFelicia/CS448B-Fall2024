00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:05 - now the first question uh which may come
00:08 - into your mind is why you should bother
00:11 - about learning C or why you should uh
00:15 - care about learning C the simple answer
00:19 - is C is the most popular language in
00:25 - modern times um so you may know or you
00:30 - may not know that c is the most uh uh
00:33 - commonly used programming language for
00:37 - writing operating system in fact the
00:40 - first operating system which was written
00:43 - is written in C which was
00:46 - Unix and the uh in the later uh you know
00:50 - years of C the Windows operating system
00:54 - and Mac OS or Linux operating system all
00:58 - written in see now in modern days all
01:03 - not all but most of the machine are
01:06 - programmed using C for example
01:09 - microcontroller or microprocessor all
01:12 - are programmed using C so if you are a
01:16 - beginner and you don't have any
01:19 - programming knowledge earlier C is uh
01:24 - the best you know best language to learn
01:27 - because C is you can say the mother of
01:31 - most of the languages even most of the
01:35 - other languages are written in C for
01:37 - example PHP Pearl or python are all
01:41 - written in C so if you know the C
01:45 - language you may you know it will be
01:48 - easier to understand other language if
01:51 - you have basic understanding of C
01:54 - language
01:55 - now once uh this introduction is over
02:00 - the second thing is what you need to
02:05 - program C now there are two basic things
02:09 - you need to program c one is the editor
02:15 - editor helps you to write your code
02:18 - right and second thing is called
02:21 - compiler compiler is a small program or
02:25 - you can say it's a small tool which
02:29 - convert your program to the machine
02:33 - language right because
02:36 - the program or whatever your computer
02:41 - doesn't understand this uh C program
02:44 - which you write this C program is just
02:48 - uh the interface of which you were write
02:51 - and it's easier to understand uh you
02:53 - know programming when you program in C
02:58 - but your computer just understand zeros
03:00 - and ones so this compiler will convert
03:04 - your program which you write and C into
03:07 - the machine language so that it can
03:10 - execute your program so these are the
03:14 - two things which you are require now in
03:17 - order to get these two things uh there
03:21 - they can be uh you know obtained free uh
03:25 - in different ways there are uh different
03:29 - IDE
03:30 - IDE stand for integrated development
03:34 - environment which helps you to write
03:36 - your code and I'm going to show you how
03:39 - you can uh install this IDE which is
03:42 - free to use uh and let's see how to
03:46 - install this IDE first so just open your
03:50 - favorite browser and just uh search for
03:54 - code
03:56 - blogs and the first link you will see
04:00 - here not this but only the code
04:06 - blocks so search for the code blocks and
04:10 - the first link here you will find is
04:13 - www.code
04:15 - bls.org this is the
04:18 - website which uh host this
04:23 - uh program called Cod code blocks and
04:27 - it's a IDE so you can see the opsource
04:32 - crossplatform free C C++ and for ID so C
04:38 - is included in this and why I am
04:41 - recommending this uh code blocks to you
04:44 - because it's crossplatform that means
04:48 - you can get this on Windows Mac OS or
04:51 - Linux operating system and uh it's open
04:56 - source so you can get it for free right
04:59 - right now how to download this you can
05:03 - just click this downloads uh button here
05:05 - or downloads button here I will click
05:08 - this downloads button here and there are
05:11 - some options which you can download
05:13 - there are there is option to download
05:16 - binary release download The Source
05:19 - release or retrieve source code from sub
05:22 - version svm what uh link we are
05:26 - interested in right now is this one
05:28 - download the binary release just click
05:30 - this
05:31 - link and in here you will find few
05:35 - options because I'm will be showing
05:37 - these tutorial on Windows I will install
05:40 - this version Windows um 2000 SL
05:44 - xp/ Vista 7 or 8 just click this link
05:49 - and then you will uh see these uh three
05:53 - options to uh install one is uh only
05:58 - code blogs which is uh the IDE which
06:01 - will help you to write your code second
06:04 - link uh will provide you the compiler
06:07 - also so just search for the link which
06:10 - uh has
06:11 - mgw in it okay which is the center link
06:15 - code blocks 13 and when at the time of
06:19 - making this video code blocks 13 is the
06:21 - newest version and just search for this
06:25 - word MV MV is a
06:28 - compiler which will help you to compile
06:31 - your program as I have said so it's
06:34 - including your compiler and editor both
06:38 - and we want uh this version right so
06:41 - just click this uh one link uh either
06:45 - this or this I will just uh click
06:48 - sourceforge.net
06:50 - link and then it will be downloaded in
06:54 - few
06:56 - seconds and download will be completed
07:00 - in few minutes because it's not a small
07:04 - file it's 97 MB file so it will take
07:07 - some time to download so just wait for
07:10 - uh this to download and I will pause the
07:14 - video and I will continue once this file
07:17 - is downloaded and I will show you how
07:19 - you can install
07:21 - it so now this uh download is complete
07:25 - so we are going to uh install this uh
07:28 - code block in our Windows operating
07:31 - system I will just click this executable
07:34 - which I have downloaded and then the
07:36 - install will
07:38 - start and says welcome to setup just
07:42 - click
07:43 - next and you just read the agreement and
07:47 - if you agree just click agree and click
07:52 - next and this is the location where code
07:55 - blocks will be installed just leave it
07:58 - as default click
08:00 - install and the install will not take uh
08:05 - much time it will be installed really
08:07 - fast you can see the code blocks icon
08:10 - here which you can click to open code
08:13 - blocks
08:14 - IDE and you can see uh it's installing
08:18 - really fast so I don't think it will
08:20 - take so much uh time to install this
08:28 - IDE
08:31 - and this code blocks IDE you can use it
08:34 - for programming other languages also
08:37 - like C++ or for for train also so in
08:41 - this way it's uh really good now if you
08:45 - don't have uh Windows uh operating
08:48 - system you can download this IDE on
08:51 - Linux also or Mac OS uh also it's
08:55 - available for all these three
08:59 - major major operating
09:03 - systems now it says the installation is
09:07 - done I think and do you want to run code
09:10 - blocks yes I want to
09:13 - run and it will run code blocks
09:19 - and says uh something I will click
09:24 - okay and here the installation is
09:28 - complete so I will click next and I will
09:32 - finish and you can see here code blocks
09:36 - is currently not a default application
09:39 - for C and C++ do you want to make it for
09:43 - as default if you wish you can uh make
09:46 - it as default or U you can leave this so
09:52 - I will just close it for now I don't
09:54 - want to make it as default
09:57 - but in this way you can install it now
10:00 - in the next video I will show you how
10:03 - you can create your first C program
10:07 - using this U code blocks so stay tuned
10:11 - and please wait comment and subscribe
10:13 - and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the first video tutorial on C programming for beginners now the first question uh which may come into your mind is why you should bother about learning C or why you should uh

these three major major operating systems now it says the installation is done I think and do you want to run code blocks yes I want to run and it will run code blocks and says uh something I will click okay and here the installation is complete so I will click next and I will finish and you can see here code blocks is currently not a default application for C and C++ do you want to make it for as default if you wish you can uh make it as default or U you can leave this so I will just close it for now I don't want to make it as default but in this way you can install it now in the next video I will show you how you can create your first C program using this U code blocks so stay tuned and please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
