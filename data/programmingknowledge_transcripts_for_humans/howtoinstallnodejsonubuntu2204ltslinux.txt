00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - use node.js on your Ubuntu operating
00:06 - system
00:07 - now there are several different ways of
00:10 - installing and using node.js on your
00:13 - Ubuntu operating system
00:15 - and if you are a node.js developer let
00:20 - me show you at least two most important
00:24 - or most useful ways to install node.js
00:30 - now you can install node.js using
00:35 - apt-get install node.js and app get
00:38 - install npm but I don't prefer that way
00:43 - and let me tell you why because
00:46 - node.js releases regularly or timely the
00:50 - new version of node and it becomes
00:53 - painful to uninstall and reinstall the
00:56 - newer version of node.js when it comes
01:01 - out right so
01:04 - I'm going to show you a flexible way
01:07 - which will be useful and let me show you
01:10 - that right so watch the full video I'm
01:13 - going to show you two different ways and
01:16 - apt get install node is not one of them
01:21 - so first of all open your favorite
01:24 - browser and search for install node.js
01:26 - snap
01:27 - and snap is a newer way of installing
01:32 - packages on your Ubuntu operating system
01:35 - so just click on the first link which
01:37 - says install node on Linux right
01:41 - I'm going to click on this link and it's
01:45 - official website from canonical which is
01:49 - also the developer of Ubuntu right so
01:52 - it's not just any website it's a
01:55 - official way of installing packages
01:58 - now from here you can select any
02:01 - node version and you can see I have this
02:06 - uh channel 18 stable Channel 20 stable
02:10 - and all these versions right generally I
02:14 - go with the top most version which is uh
02:19 - 18 stable at the time of making this
02:22 - video I'm going to click on install and
02:24 - it's going to give me the command to
02:26 - install
02:27 - uh node using that Command right so you
02:32 - can see it's install 18 stable and I'm
02:36 - going to copy this command and then open
02:39 - the terminal so to open the terminal
02:41 - just press Ctrl alt t or you can go to
02:45 - the application and open the terminal
02:47 - from here once the terminal is open
02:49 - paste this command snap already comes on
02:53 - your Ubuntu operating system by default
02:55 - if you have the newer version of Ubuntu
02:58 - so you just need to give this command
03:00 - and then give the ubuntu's password and
03:03 - then press enter
03:04 - which is going to install
03:07 - the node.js using the snap once this
03:12 - command is successful you can see the
03:14 - version of node which is installed which
03:16 - is
03:17 - 18.16.0 let's go to the node.js official
03:22 - website and see what is the latest
03:23 - version there and you can see
03:27 - 18.16.0 LTS is the latest uh stable
03:32 - version right and that is the one we
03:35 - have installed so it's up to date
03:37 - version we have installed right
03:40 - so now let's check the version of node
03:44 - node hyphen hyphen version
03:47 - and hopefully it will give you the
03:49 - version
03:50 - node also comes with npm so let's check
03:53 - the version of
03:55 - npm
03:58 - and it'll give you the version of npm
04:02 - now uh any time when a newer version of
04:06 - node.js comes or any patch comes for
04:10 - this version
04:11 - Snaps are auto updating right so you
04:15 - will normally have a node.js installed
04:17 - for you on the same day on which
04:20 - official node.js version is released
04:23 - right so you don't need to worry about
04:24 - it so if the patches comes to this
04:27 - version uh you don't need to worry uh
04:30 - everything will be automatically updated
04:33 - if you want to update to a newer version
04:36 - let's say you want to update to a
04:38 - version 20 for node.js right what you
04:42 - can do here is you can give this command
04:46 - which is sudo snap and then
04:50 - refresh command and then the name of the
04:53 - package in our case it's node and then
04:56 - hyphen hyphen channel right and you can
05:00 - give the channel 20 here which means you
05:03 - want to install the version 20 of
05:07 - node.js right so you can go to the snap
05:11 - website and see
05:13 - which version is the latest version and
05:16 - then you can install that right you can
05:19 - see
05:20 - Channel 20 means 20 stable so when you
05:24 - click on 20 stable you can see hyphen
05:27 - hyphen channel is equal to 24 slash
05:30 - table classic right if you want to
05:33 - install different version you can do
05:36 - that just you need to change the channel
05:38 - here right
05:40 - so this is how you can upgrade or
05:42 - downgrade the node.js version using snap
05:45 - now one way I frequently use to switch
05:49 - between
05:50 - node.js version is not by switching the
05:54 - snap version but using a utility called
05:57 - NVM which is called node version manager
06:01 - so just go to your browser and search
06:03 - for install NVM
06:06 - and the first link which will appear
06:08 - here will be from this GitHub repository
06:11 - which is github.com forward slash NVM
06:15 - hyphen sh click on this NVM repository
06:19 - go down
06:21 - and here you will see installing and
06:23 - updating you can either copy this
06:26 - command or this command both will
06:29 - install the NVM right so you just need
06:33 - to copy one of these commands I'm going
06:37 - to use the curl command you can also use
06:40 - the
06:41 - wget command for your Ubuntu operating
06:43 - system and I'm going to go to the
06:46 - terminal paste this command and then
06:48 - press enter which is going to directly
06:50 - install NVM you don't need to do
06:52 - anything once NVM is installed you can
06:55 - just write NVM here and and right now
06:59 - it's not recognized NVM because I
07:02 - haven't read this text here it says
07:05 - close and open your terminal to start
07:07 - using NVM and run the following command
07:10 - for example you can run this NVM dare
07:14 - command for uh the setting for setting
07:18 - the NVM directory
07:20 - so I'm going to open the new terminal
07:22 - control shift T will open the new
07:25 - terminal here you can write NVM and you
07:28 - can see NVM command is recognized now
07:32 - now here I want to check the versions of
07:37 - NVM right so
07:40 - so now using NVM I want to check the
07:43 - versions of node right so let me clear
07:46 - the terminal so first of all here for
07:50 - NVM I'm going to write NVM and I want to
07:53 - list the current versions of node.js
07:57 - right I can just write NVM LS and you
08:02 - can see
08:03 - it says this arrow and redirect it to
08:07 - system system means whatever version of
08:11 - node.js is installed on your system and
08:13 - VM recognizes it and the current version
08:16 - which is set for NVM is this system
08:19 - version you can also list the versions
08:23 - which are available remotely so you can
08:25 - just write lists and then remote so list
08:29 - hyphen remote here and then press enter
08:33 - and it's going to give you the list of
08:34 - all the versions which you can install
08:37 - using NVM let's say I want to install
08:40 - the version
08:43 - let's say 18.10.0 right now the version
08:47 - is
08:49 - 18.16.0 right so let me show you the
08:52 - node version
08:55 - which is
08:56 - 18.164.0 and let's say I want to install
08:59 - the version different than
09:02 - 18.16.0 I can just write NVM
09:07 - install and the version I want to
09:10 - install right so
09:13 - I will go with the last LTS version
09:16 - which is a version
09:19 - 16.20.0 I can copy this version and then
09:22 - paste here okay so NVM install and then
09:26 - paste the version and you can see V is
09:30 - added in front of this version so just
09:33 - copy it from here press enter and it's
09:36 - going to install the version 16.
09:39 - and then
09:41 - NVM makes it really easy to switch
09:44 - between these node versions right once
09:48 - again I can just write NVM LS
09:51 - and it shows me now two versions one is
09:57 - 16.20.0 and other is the system version
10:01 - and the current selected version is
10:03 - 16.20.0
10:05 - so I can just write node hyphen iPhone
10:09 - version and then press enter and you can
10:13 - see
10:14 - now the current version is
10:18 - 16.20.0 now in order to change this
10:20 - version you can only use this version or
10:23 - the system version so in order to use a
10:25 - version you need to install it first so
10:28 - write NVM use so right now I have
10:33 - 16.20.0 or system so I can switch to the
10:36 - system and I can copy and paste it here
10:39 - and then press enter and now I'm using
10:42 - the system version which is
10:45 - 18.16.0 so I can once again give this
10:48 - command and now I'm using
10:50 - 18.16.0 so I don't need to run
10:54 - the snap update or downgrade command to
10:59 - uh switch between node I can use NVM to
11:04 - switch between node versions right
11:06 - so this is how you can download and
11:09 - install node and npm on your Ubuntu
11:12 - operating system I hope you enjoyed this
11:14 - video and I will see you in the next
11:16 - video
