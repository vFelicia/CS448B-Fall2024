00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java effects tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - the last video we have seen what are
00:07 - properties in Java effects and how to
00:10 - use properties in Java effects
00:12 - now in this video we will see what is
00:15 - binding and how to use binding in Java
00:20 - FX and we will see how to use
00:23 - specifically uni-directional binding in
00:26 - java effects so first of all what is
00:30 - binding so Java effects property binding
00:33 - allows you to synchronize the value of
00:36 - two properties so that whenever one of
00:40 - the property changes the value of other
00:43 - property is also changed or updated
00:47 - automatically right so for binding you
00:50 - need to have properties now there are
00:54 - two types of binding one is
00:57 - unidirectional binding which we are
00:59 - going to see in this video and other is
01:02 - bi-directional binding which we will see
01:05 - in the next video how to use it so let's
01:07 - get started and see how uni-directional
01:10 - binding works in Java FX so what I'm
01:14 - going to do is I'm going to use the last
01:16 - video code which I have shown you in the
01:19 - last video so in the last video we have
01:22 - created this class in which we have
01:25 - created the number property and we have
01:28 - set the getter and setter for this
01:32 - property and we have created extra
01:34 - function to access this property right
01:38 - and in the controller what we were doing
01:40 - is whenever we click the button it was
01:44 - changing the property and as a result it
01:46 - was displaying the number on the label
01:52 - right so just we will continue from the
01:56 - last video so if you haven't seen the
01:59 - last video just see it and use the same
02:01 - code in this video okay now what we are
02:05 - going to do first is we will open our
02:09 - main dot F XML file I have already
02:11 - opened it
02:13 - in the last video we have used a label
02:16 - and a button now what I'm going to do
02:18 - here is I'm going to go to the controls
02:21 - and I'm going to use one more button
02:23 - here so this button I'm going to use to
02:27 - increment the value and second button
02:30 - I'm going to use to decrement the value
02:33 - and let's say we are going to use a
02:38 - progress bar in this video and I will
02:40 - show you how you can use progress bar
02:43 - and let's say progress indicator also
02:48 - progress indicator and progress bar
02:51 - almost works in a similar fashion so you
02:56 - can see both at the same time how they
02:59 - work okay
03:00 - so just take a progress bar and a
03:04 - progress indicator now go to the
03:08 - properties of this progress bar for
03:11 - example so click here properties and the
03:14 - first property here is progress right
03:17 - now when you increase this slider you
03:22 - can set the initial value to this
03:25 - progress bar and this progress bar works
03:30 - from zero to one okay so the maximum
03:33 - limit is one and minimum is 0 by default
03:37 - so whenever you you know set your bar at
03:41 - the middle it will be 0.5 right same
03:45 - works the progress indicator so it works
03:49 - between 0 & 1
03:50 - and when you slide the slider to 50% it
03:55 - will show the 50% on the progress
03:58 - indicator ok so let's see how we can
04:04 - manage these indicator and progress bar
04:08 - using these button so first of all what
04:11 - I'm going to do is I'm going to give
04:12 - some ID to this progress bar and
04:15 - progress indicator so go to the code and
04:17 - select your progress bar and for example
04:20 - the ID is VB for a progress bar and
04:24 - select progress indicate
04:27 - and the ID I'm going to give it is pi/4
04:31 - progress indicator okay so progress bar
04:34 - is P B and progress indicator is P I and
04:39 - one more thing I'm going to do is I'm
04:41 - going to add a method here so I have
04:46 - already created this button click method
04:49 - in the last video I'm going to create
04:52 - one more method for example button to
04:54 - click method which I'm going to create
04:58 - in this video to decrement the value now
05:02 - save your F XML file and then go to your
05:06 - project and refresh your project here
05:09 - and now in here first of all we will
05:13 - declare the variables for progress bar
05:17 - and progress indicator so inside your
05:21 - main controller dot Java class just
05:23 - declare these two variables which are
05:26 - progress bar and progress indicator
05:30 - right and this must be same which you
05:34 - have given in F XML file so we have
05:37 - given for progress bar PB and progress
05:41 - indicator P I ID right and just add the
05:45 - import for progress bar and progress
05:49 - indicator next what we are going to do
05:52 - is we are going to take our progress bar
05:55 - variable and then we will call a method
05:58 - called progress property on it and to
06:02 - bind the progress property to any other
06:05 - property we use a method called bind so
06:09 - just call a method called bind on it and
06:13 - then it takes the property as an
06:17 - argument okay so we already have created
06:20 - in our my number dot Java class this
06:24 - function which is number property so
06:27 - just copy this number property function
06:30 - name and then go here and take your my
06:35 - number class object which was my num
06:40 - then call this number property here so
06:43 - what this code is doing it's binding the
06:47 - property of the progress bar to the
06:50 - property of this number class okay and
06:55 - it's doing it in one direction so
06:58 - whenever the value of my number changes
07:02 - the progress bar will be changed
07:05 - accordingly okay and the same we are
07:08 - going to do with progress indicator so
07:12 - just copy the same code but just change
07:15 - this variable name here next what we are
07:18 - going to do is we have already created
07:20 - this button click event for this button
07:23 - which is button one and now we are going
07:27 - to create the second method for the
07:29 - button - ok and we have named the method
07:33 - for the button - here you can see here
07:36 - we have named it button to click ok so
07:39 - just give the same name here and in here
07:43 - we are going to subtract from the value
07:46 - of the number ok so because progress bar
07:52 - limit is in between zero and one so what
07:57 - we are going to do is we are going to
07:58 - increment the value by 0.1 so 0.1 we
08:04 - will increase whenever we click this
08:06 - button and we will decrement the value
08:09 - so minus 0.1 okay so we will decrement
08:15 - by 0.1 and we will increment the value
08:17 - by 0.1 and let's change the text of this
08:22 - button so it will be clear that this is
08:24 - positive and this is negative button so
08:27 - just select your button and go to the
08:30 - property and let's change it to plus
08:32 - symbol and the other two minus symbol
08:37 - okay and save your F XML file and
08:41 - refresh your project in Eclipse and save
08:46 - all of your code and run it now so the
08:49 - app is running now so first of all I am
08:52 - going to
08:53 - just click this positive button and
08:56 - let's see what happens so whenever I
08:59 - click this it's increased by 10% or 0.1
09:04 - okay once again 0.1 and you can see the
09:08 - value in the label here right so it's
09:11 - increasing 10% at a time
09:15 - and whenever you click this negative
09:18 - button is going to decrease the value in
09:20 - the progress bar and the progress
09:23 - indicator so this is how you need
09:26 - errection albino works in Java FX and
09:30 - why it's called unidirectional binding
09:33 - because whenever we change the value
09:36 - using this button the progress bar you
09:40 - know progress changes but opposite is
09:43 - not true here so we can't change the
09:47 - value or any properties in the button
09:50 - whenever we change the progress bar
09:54 - right it's only one directional so
09:56 - whenever you click the button it
09:59 - increases or decreases the value in the
10:02 - progress bar but you cannot make it
10:05 - bi-directional because you cannot set
10:08 - any value to the progress bar or
10:10 - progress indicator and this is exactly
10:14 - what we are going to see in the next
10:16 - video how we can achieve the
10:19 - bi-directional binding in Java FX so
10:23 - stay tuned and please rate comment
10:25 - subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video on Java effects tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen what are properties in Java effects and how to use properties in Java effects now in this video we will see what is binding and how to use binding in Java FX and we will see how to use specifically unidirectional binding in java effects so first of all what is binding so Java effects property binding allows you to synchronize the value of two properties so that whenever one of the property changes the value of other property is also changed or updated automatically right so for binding you need to have properties now there are two types of binding one is unidirectional binding which we are going to see in this video and other is bidirectional binding which we will see in the next video how to use it so let's get started and see how unidirectional binding works in Java FX so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the last video code which I have shown you in the last video so in the last video we have created this class in which we have created the number property and we have set the getter and setter for this property and we have created extra function to access this property right and in the controller what we were doing is whenever we click the button it was changing the property and as a result it was displaying the number on the label right so just we will continue from the last video so if you haven't seen the last video just see it and use the same code in this video okay now what we are going to do first is we will open our main dot F XML file I have already opened it in the last video we have used a label and a button now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go to the controls and I'm going to use one more button here so this button I'm going to use to increment the value and second button I'm going to use to decrement the value and let's say we are going to use a progress bar in this video and I will show you how you can use progress bar and let's say progress indicator also progress indicator and progress bar almost works in a similar fashion so you can see both at the same time how they work okay so just take a progress bar and a progress indicator now go to the properties of this progress bar for example so click here properties and the first property here is progress right now when you increase this slider you can set the initial value to this progress bar and this progress bar works from zero to one okay so the maximum limit is one and minimum is 0 by default so whenever you you know set your bar at the middle it will be 0.5 right same works the progress indicator so it works between 0 & 1 and when you slide the slider to 50% it will show the 50% on the progress indicator ok so let's see how we can manage these indicator and progress bar using these button so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to give some ID to this progress bar and progress indicator so go to the code and select your progress bar and for example the ID is VB for a progress bar and select progress indicate and the ID I'm going to give it is pi/4 progress indicator okay so progress bar is P B and progress indicator is P I and one more thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a method here so I have already created this button click method in the last video I'm going to create one more method for example button to click method which I'm going to create in this video to decrement the value now save your F XML file and then go to your project and refresh your project here and now in here first of all we will declare the variables for progress bar and progress indicator so inside your main controller dot Java class just declare these two variables which are progress bar and progress indicator right and this must be same which you have given in F XML file so we have given for progress bar PB and progress indicator P I ID right and just add the import for progress bar and progress indicator next what we are going to do is we are going to take our progress bar variable and then we will call a method called progress property on it and to bind the progress property to any other property we use a method called bind so just call a method called bind on it and then it takes the property as an argument okay so we already have created in our my number dot Java class this function which is number property so just copy this number property function name and then go here and take your my number class object which was my num then call this number property here so what this code is doing it's binding the property of the progress bar to the property of this number class okay and it's doing it in one direction so whenever the value of my number changes the progress bar will be changed accordingly okay and the same we are going to do with progress indicator so just copy the same code but just change this variable name here next what we are going to do is we have already created this button click event for this button which is button one and now we are going to create the second method for the button ok and we have named the method for the button here you can see here we have named it button to click ok so just give the same name here and in here we are going to subtract from the value of the number ok so because progress bar limit is in between zero and one so what we are going to do is we are going to increment the value by 0.1 so 0.1 we will increase whenever we click this button and we will decrement the value so minus 0.1 okay so we will decrement by 0.1 and we will increment the value by 0.1 and let's change the text of this button so it will be clear that this is positive and this is negative button so just select your button and go to the property and let's change it to plus symbol and the other two minus symbol okay and save your F XML file and refresh your project in Eclipse and save all of your code and run it now so the app is running now so first of all I am going to just click this positive button and let's see what happens so whenever I click this it's increased by 10% or 0.1 okay once again 0.1 and you can see the value in the label here right so it's increasing 10% at a time and whenever you click this negative button is going to decrease the value in the progress bar and the progress indicator so this is how you need errection albino works in Java FX and why it's called unidirectional binding because whenever we change the value using this button the progress bar you know progress changes but opposite is not true here so we can't change the value or any properties in the button whenever we change the progress bar right it's only one directional so whenever you click the button it increases or decreases the value in the progress bar but you cannot make it bidirectional because you cannot set any value to the progress bar or progress indicator and this is exactly what we are going to see in the next video how we can achieve the bidirectional binding in Java FX so stay tuned and please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
