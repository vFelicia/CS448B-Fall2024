00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to
00:03 - create a
00:04 - basic simple calculator using
00:08 - C++ and you have seen uh and I have
00:12 - shown you how to do addition subtraction
00:16 - multiplication for multiplication you
00:18 - use this ASX sign for division uh it's a
00:22 - little bit twisty concept because this
00:27 - will give you uh the division value and
00:29 - this modulus will give you the remainder
00:31 - value so if you have not understood
00:34 - these division concept just go to the
00:36 - last video and see it now in this video
00:40 - I'm going to talk to you further about
00:42 - this basic
00:45 - arithmetic and what I'm going to do is I
00:48 - will declare this int X here and I am
00:51 - just simply printing
00:55 - it so insertion operator X and semicolon
01:00 - and for example now you have little bit
01:05 - complex calculations so for example you
01:10 - have
01:13 - 10
01:16 - into
01:18 - 20
01:20 - +
01:22 - 30 divided by
01:25 - 40 and minus
01:28 - 50 so for the first time when you see it
01:32 - it looks it will still
01:35 - calculates uh the value of x but when
01:39 - the other user of you yourself will see
01:43 - this calculation it looks little bit
01:46 - complex and you will not be able to
01:49 - understand it by seeing it for the first
01:51 - time you need to you think that yeah
01:54 - this will happen first so if you have
01:57 - uh SE uh remember
02:00 - the concept in the school uh this
02:04 - concept was called
02:06 - PE MD s which means the sequence of the
02:12 - calculation will be parenthesis exponent
02:16 - then the multiplication division
02:18 - addition and subtraction so in the same
02:22 - this is the same concept will be used
02:24 - here first will happen the parenthesis
02:27 - which we don't have right now but and
02:30 - then happens the exponent which also we
02:33 - don't have then happens the
02:34 - multiplication so this will happen first
02:37 - then will happen the division then this
02:40 - will happen then the addition so that
02:43 - this will happen and then the
02:44 - subtraction so whatever value you will
02:48 - get subtract 50 by this but it's always
02:52 - a good practice to use parenthesis so
02:56 - you yourself can understand by seeing
02:59 - this calculation at once so for example
03:04 - I will use parenthesis
03:08 - here and parenthesis here so you know
03:13 - that yes I
03:15 - have this value and I want to divide
03:18 - this value by this value and to make it
03:21 - more simple just give the parenthesis
03:25 - here also so
03:28 - now whenever you see it you know that
03:31 - yes this will happen first the
03:33 - multiplication of this two numbers will
03:35 - happen first and then whatever the
03:37 - product is it will have be added to 30
03:40 - and this will be the subtraction
03:44 - whatever will be the result and whatever
03:47 - will be the result of the numerator it
03:49 - will be divided by this
03:52 - okay and now when you run build your
03:55 - program and run it it
03:57 - will give you the the answer but yeah
04:01 - it's always a good practice to use these
04:05 - parenthesis in order to understand by
04:08 - yourself that what's going to happen
04:11 - otherwise you need
04:13 - to you know invest your mind yes this
04:17 - will happen or this will that will
04:19 - happen so yeah always use parentheses
04:23 - when you want to do this kind of lengthy
04:28 - calculations okay so I hope you have
04:31 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
04:33 - and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to create a basic simple calculator using C++ and you have seen uh and I have shown you how to do addition subtraction multiplication for multiplication you use this ASX sign for division uh it's a little bit twisty concept because this will give you uh the division value and this modulus will give you the remainder value so if you have not understood these division concept just go to the last video and see it now in this video I'm going to talk to you further about this basic arithmetic and what I'm going to do is I will declare this int X here and I am just simply printing it so insertion operator X and semicolon and for example now you have little bit complex calculations so for example you have 10 into 20 + 30 divided by 40 and minus 50 so for the first time when you see it it looks it will still calculates uh the value of x but when the other user of you yourself will see this calculation it looks little bit complex and you will not be able to understand it by seeing it for the first time you need to you think that yeah this will happen first so if you have uh SE uh remember the concept in the school uh this concept was called PE MD s which means the sequence of the calculation will be parenthesis exponent then the multiplication division addition and subtraction so in the same this is the same concept will be used here first will happen the parenthesis which we don't have right now but and then happens the exponent which also we don't have then happens the multiplication so this will happen first then will happen the division then this will happen then the addition so that this will happen and then the subtraction so whatever value you will get subtract 50 by this but it's always a good practice to use parenthesis so you yourself can understand by seeing this calculation at once so for example I will use parenthesis here and parenthesis here so you know that yes I have this value and I want to divide this value by this value and to make it more simple just give the parenthesis here also so now whenever you see it you know that yes this will happen first the multiplication of this two numbers will happen first and then whatever the product is it will have be added to 30 and this will be the subtraction whatever will be the result and whatever will be the result of the numerator it will be divided by this okay and now when you run build your program and run it it will give you the the answer but yeah it's always a good practice to use these parenthesis in order to understand by yourself that what's going to happen otherwise you need to you know invest your mind yes this will happen or this will that will happen so yeah always use parentheses when you want to do this kind of lengthy calculations okay so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
