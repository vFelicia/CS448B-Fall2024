00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Visual Studio code on your Rubin to
00:06 - operating system so let's get started so
00:08 - first of all you can open your favorite
00:10 - browser and search for es code and the
00:13 - first language will appear here will be
00:14 - from code dot visual studio comm so we
00:17 - are going to just click on this link and
00:19 - straight away you will be able to see
00:21 - these two downloads button so what we
00:25 - need for Ubuntu is this dot DB file and
00:29 - then I'm going to just click on save and
00:31 - then click on OK which is going to start
00:33 - the download of this dot DB file now
00:37 - once this file is downloaded I'm going
00:39 - to minimize the browser and then I'm
00:41 - going to open the terminal
00:42 - by just pressing ctrl alt T and then I'm
00:45 - going to navigate to the location where
00:47 - this file is downloaded so I'm going to
00:50 - just CD to the Downloads folder and then
00:56 - I'm going to list out all the files here
00:58 - so you can see this dot DB file is there
01:01 - for the visual studio code so in order
01:04 - to run this file there are two methods
01:06 - if you want to do it graphically then
01:09 - you can just open your files and folders
01:13 - go to downloads folder and then right
01:15 - click on this file and then click on
01:18 - open with other application and then
01:21 - click on software install and then click
01:24 - on select which is going to install this
01:26 - visual studio code graphically otherwise
01:29 - you have the second choice and that is
01:32 - via terminal so for now I'm going to use
01:35 - the terminal to install visual studio
01:36 - code so for that we just need to write
01:38 - sudo dpkg and then - I and the name of
01:44 - the file and then press ENTER and then
01:47 - give your open tools lock and password
01:49 - this is going to start that installation
01:51 - of Visual Studio code on your open -
01:54 - operating system so now you can see
01:58 - everything is done once this command is
02:01 - finished you are ready to use Visual
02:05 - Studio code so first of all let's see if
02:07 - code icon is created on the Applications
02:10 - folder so just click on this show up
02:13 - occasions button here and here you will
02:18 - be able to see this icon which is Visual
02:20 - Studio code icon so you can just click
02:22 - on this icon and Visual Studio code will
02:26 - be opened on your window operating
02:28 - system so using Visual Studio code is
02:31 - really easy and straightforward so let's
02:34 - say if you want to just open some folder
02:38 - you can just click on file and open
02:41 - folder and navigate to the location
02:43 - where you want to open this folder so I
02:47 - will just click on the desktop for now
02:49 - and here you can create some folders so
02:54 - let's say I am going to just create a
02:56 - folder called SRC for source and then
03:01 - I'm going to just say ok we're just
03:04 - going to open this SRC folder inside
03:06 - Visual Studio code right now in order to
03:09 - create a new file you can just click on
03:13 - this new file option or if you want to
03:16 - create a folder then click on the new
03:18 - folder option so let's create a new file
03:21 - let's say I want to create a hello dot
03:24 - py file which is a Python file so as
03:27 - soon as you create some file it can be a
03:29 - Java file or a Python file or C++ file
03:33 - visual studio code will give you some
03:35 - extension recommendations right so here
03:39 - you can see I have the recommendation
03:41 - for python extension these extension i
03:44 - can also find here so when you click on
03:47 - this extension icon you can find many
03:50 - useful extensions related to many
03:52 - different languages so you have the
03:55 - popular ones here Python C++ C sharp
03:59 - when you type here let's say Java then
04:02 - you will find all the related extensions
04:05 - related to Java language or let's say I
04:10 - just press C++ you have all the options
04:12 - related to C++ right so let's say I just
04:18 - want to print something in my terminal
04:23 - so I will just write
04:25 - hello world and then I'm going to just
04:30 - save this file by pressing control s and
04:32 - then if you want to run this code you
04:35 - don't need to open the ubuntu terminal
04:37 - you can open the terminal inside the
04:40 - visual studio code by just clicking on
04:42 - terminal and then click on new terminal
04:44 - which is going to open this terminal in
04:47 - the same directory in which you are
04:49 - working in so when I do LS I can see
04:52 - this hello dot py file and then in order
04:55 - to run this file I just need to use
04:58 - Python 3 and then the name of the file
05:01 - which is going to give me this output
05:03 - it's also also possible to set up total
05:07 - Python environment in your visual studio
05:10 - code editor which is the topic for
05:14 - another video but I just wanted to show
05:16 - you how you can use Visual Studio code
05:20 - you have the debug options here and also
05:25 - you have the source control options so
05:27 - if you want to version control your code
05:30 - you can use this option here and Visual
05:35 - Studio code automatically recognizes if
05:38 - you are working under gate or any other
05:41 - version control system and it's going to
05:43 - give you appropriate solutions or hints
05:47 - here if you want to search anything you
05:49 - can click on the search option here or
05:51 - you can press ctrl F to search inside
05:54 - the file in which you are working also
05:56 - if you want to just see the folder view
06:00 - then you can just click on the first
06:02 - option here ok so let me just close this
06:05 - window and let me just close this
06:08 - terminal also now if you want to just
06:11 - add the visual studio code icon or
06:14 - shortcut to this left bar then you can
06:17 - open the visual studio code from here
06:19 - and then you can just right click on the
06:23 - icon and then click on add to favorites
06:25 - which is going to permanently add this
06:28 - icon on the left hand bar here also I
06:31 - want to show you one little trick so if
06:34 - you open a terminal and if you want to
06:37 - use the
06:38 - terminal and let's say I will just
06:41 - navigate to my desk top folder where my
06:46 - SRC folder is there this one right so
06:49 - from the terminal if I want to open the
06:52 - visual studio code I can just write code
06:55 - here and then press Enter
06:57 - we're just going to open the terminal
06:59 - right now if I want to open the visual
07:03 - studio code inside a particular
07:04 - directory then I can just CD to that
07:08 - directory so CD SRC for example and then
07:11 - I can just write code space dot which is
07:14 - going to open the visual studio code
07:16 - inside the same directory in which I
07:19 - have given this combined which is code
07:23 - space dot okay so if you want to open
07:27 - the code using terminal you can use
07:29 - these commands also so this is how you
07:32 - can download and install visual studio
07:35 - code on your Ubuntu operating system I
07:38 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
07:40 - will see you in the next video
