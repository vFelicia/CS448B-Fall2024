00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:04 - link a chart control with your database
00:08 - and show it into your Visual Basic
00:11 - Windows Form so uh let's get started
00:15 - first of all what you need to do is go
00:17 - to your
00:18 - toolbox and search for the control
00:21 - called chart control it will be in let's
00:26 - see where it is it'll be in this do uh
00:30 - section here so just drag and drop this
00:33 - chart control from here and place it
00:36 - into your
00:37 - form and this is our do chart control
00:41 - okay you can resize your chart
00:45 - control because it's a little bit
00:48 - bigger okay so this is our chart control
00:53 - right now in order to
00:55 - connect the data base to this chart
00:59 - control what you can do is just select
01:01 - your chart from here and go to the
01:05 - properties of this chart and search for
01:07 - the property called data source by
01:10 - default this property is none so just
01:13 - click this combo box here and just
01:16 - select your employee data binding Source
01:20 - because we have already uh binded our
01:23 - database with our with this project you
01:26 - will be able to see your database name
01:29 - plus b finding Source here otherwise if
01:31 - you don't see it here you need to go to
01:34 - this add data add project data source
01:37 - and once again you need to add the data
01:40 - source right so from here you can add
01:44 - the data source uh as I have shown you
01:47 - in the first video of the series so just
01:50 - select this employee data source data
01:53 - binding Source or whatever database name
01:56 - you have plus The Binding source and
01:59 - just select it now this next step is to
02:04 - go further down and search for the
02:07 - property called series here okay so
02:11 - search for the property called series
02:13 - and this series in here you can add
02:19 - uh new X and Y AIS to your um uh chart
02:25 - so I will search for the data source
02:30 - here just go to data source and in here
02:32 - I can choose x value member and Y value
02:35 - member so for example I want to show
02:38 - first name on the x value member as of
02:42 - on the x-axis and I want to show the pay
02:45 - of the employee on the Y AIS okay so I
02:50 - will select this and when you go further
02:55 - down you will be able to or here in the
02:58 - chart section here
03:00 - you can select the type chart type
03:03 - whatever you want to select it has bar
03:06 - charts Stakes chart line chart pie chart
03:09 - and yeah all kind of possible chart I
03:13 - will leave it as default as column chart
03:16 - for now and I will click
03:18 - okay and now when I run the
03:25 - program I can see the name versus age
03:29 - chart and I can verify this name versus
03:33 - age uh chart also and because our name
03:38 - is name length
03:42 - is more or or greater than this bar
03:46 - chart so it's hiding some names for now
03:49 - so what we can do is we can just go to
03:52 - our property once
03:55 - again so just search for the property
03:59 - called called chart area here and in the
04:02 - collection just click the small button
04:04 - once again and in here go to
04:08 - access and click this access collection
04:11 - once again and click this small button
04:14 - here and you will see x-axis Y axis
04:17 - secondary xaxis and secondary y-axis so
04:20 - our uh names are on xaxis right so
04:23 - select X access and then search for the
04:28 - property called in interval here so in
04:31 - the interval property by default it's
04:34 - Auto interval is auto so what you need
04:37 - to do is just delete this Auto from here
04:40 - and make it one so it will make your
04:42 - interval one and click okay and click
04:45 - okay and now when you run the
04:48 - program you will see all the names uh in
04:51 - front of your bars so Julie Paul local
04:57 - or whatever names are there they will be
05:00 - shown in front of these bars so you can
05:04 - uh play the with these properties in uh
05:08 - this
05:09 - series
05:11 - and you can just choose the type which
05:14 - you want to show and you can play with
05:18 - uh the properties in this chart area and
05:22 - you can uh just uh customize or chart
05:26 - with these so I hope you have understood
05:29 - the basic concept and please RIT comment
05:31 - and subscribe and bye for now
