00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - nodejs tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can download
00:07 - and install nodejs on our Ubuntu
00:10 - operating system and we will also see
00:13 - how we can uh create our first simple uh
00:16 - server using nodejs so first of all open
00:20 - your favorite browser and just search
00:22 - for
00:23 - nodejs from here and the first link
00:26 - which will appear here will be from uh
00:28 - nodejs.org
00:30 - so just go inside it and uh in here you
00:34 - will be able to see the versions of uh
00:36 - node available so we have the LTS
00:40 - version which is the long-term service
00:43 - version which is
00:44 - 4.0.0 and at the time of making this
00:47 - video we have the current version also
00:49 - which is the latest version which is 6.
00:52 - 5.0 so we will try to install this one
00:55 - current version now in order to uh
00:58 - download this current version what we
01:01 - can do here is we can go to download so
01:04 - just click downloads here and just
01:07 - scroll down uh a little bit at the
01:10 - bottom and here you will be able to see
01:13 - installing nodejs via package manager so
01:17 - just click this link which says
01:18 - installing nodejs via package
01:22 - manager and because we are installing uh
01:25 - nodejs on our open to operating system
01:28 - here is the heading uh which says Debian
01:31 - and open to based Linux distribution
01:33 - right and then there are some commands
01:37 - which will allow you to download and
01:40 - install nodejs on your system which are
01:43 - these two commands which is curl uh
01:47 - first of all you need to add the PPA and
01:49 - then you can install the nodejs so one
01:53 - first uh version is for 4.5 which is a
01:57 - LTS version so we don't want this for
02:01 - now we want this one which is version
02:04 - 6.5 right so we will use these two
02:06 - command but if you uh can observe here
02:10 - this command is using curl so first of
02:13 - all we need to uh ensure that curl is
02:16 - installed on our system so what we will
02:19 - do we will just uh open our terminal
02:22 - first of all and in here we will check
02:25 - if curl is there so just uh write curl
02:29 - simply and press enter and you can see
02:32 - on my system curl is not installed so
02:35 - this says the program curl is currently
02:37 - not installed but maybe in your system
02:40 - it's installed so you don't need to
02:42 - follow this command so for me I will
02:45 - just uh give this command which is uh
02:49 - given by this uh message to me which is
02:52 - pseudo apt minus get installed curl
02:55 - right so I will just copy this command
02:59 - and then paste it here to install curl
03:02 - right and I will give my password here
03:06 - and then curl will be installed on my
03:09 - system now the next thing before uh we
03:14 - uh can use this command for uh you know
03:17 - installing the PPA we just need to
03:20 - install one more uh thing which is
03:22 - python software properties okay so let's
03:25 - install python software properties I
03:27 - will just clear the screen for now
03:30 - and then I will just paste the command
03:32 - for uh installing P python software
03:35 - properties which is this command sudo
03:37 - app minus get install python minus
03:40 - software minus properties so I will
03:42 - paste this command in the description so
03:44 - you don't need to remember them or
03:46 - retype them you can just copy and paste
03:48 - on your system to install node J on your
03:51 - system okay so second command is this
03:53 - one sudo app get installed python
03:55 - software properties okay now once uh
03:59 - this is done we will be ready to install
04:02 - the nodejs itself so first of all we
04:05 - will just copy this command which will
04:07 - add the
04:09 - PPA and just clear it once again the
04:12 - terminal and once again I will paste
04:15 - this which I have copied from here this
04:17 - command okay and I will just press enter
04:22 - and then this will download all the PPA
04:25 - files and once this uh
04:29 - download is complete we can just use
04:33 - this command to install nodejs which is
04:35 - pseudo app minus get installed minus y
04:39 - nodejs okay so I will just copy this
04:42 - command by the meantime and we will wait
04:45 - for uh this uh to complete and now it
04:49 - says you just need to uh run apt get
04:53 - installed node just this is what we are
04:56 - going to do so we will just paste the
04:58 - command which we have copied which is
05:00 - Pudo app minus get install minus y uh
05:03 - nodejs and press enter which will
05:05 - install nodejs on our open to operating
05:08 - system or any other dbn system uh if
05:11 - you're using other DN system it will
05:14 - install on that system also okay so just
05:17 - wait for uh this installation to
05:19 - complete and then we will check whether
05:22 - nodejs is really installed on our system
05:25 - or not right so now nodejs is installed
05:28 - on our system now we just need to check
05:30 - whether it's really installed or not so
05:32 - I will once again clear the terminal and
05:35 - in here first of all I will just give
05:37 - the command node minus V to uh check the
05:40 - version of uh node installed and it
05:43 - gives version
05:45 - 6.5.0 so this is the version which we
05:48 - have installed and uh you can see on the
05:51 - homepage this is the version which is
05:53 - currently available which is uh version
05:56 - 6.5.0 so node is properly installed
06:00 - and node also installs uh npm which is
06:04 - node package manager with it to uh you
06:07 - know install different kind of uh node
06:10 - modules which are publicly available so
06:14 - with this command node NP npm is also
06:17 - installed so we will we can check uh
06:19 - whether it's really installed or not so
06:21 - you can just give npm minus V and if it
06:25 - gives the version then npm is also
06:28 - installed so now we know that node is
06:31 - properly installed so to to check node
06:34 - you can just give command node and it
06:37 - will give you this kind of interface and
06:39 - here you can just write
06:43 - console. log and uh you can print for
06:47 - example hello node here so I will just
06:49 - say hello node and give the semicolon
06:53 - here and press enter and it's going to
06:55 - print whatever you have written in
06:58 - between these codes in the node log
07:01 - right and after this it will give this
07:04 - undefined which is our correct Behavior
07:06 - so now we know that node is properly
07:09 - installed on our system and when we
07:12 - press uh do exit we can uh come out of
07:16 - uh this node so just write do exist and
07:19 - we are out of uh the node terminal right
07:24 - now uh let's create a small uh uh server
07:28 - so we we will once again go to the
07:31 - nodejs.org website and in here go to
07:35 - about and in about section you can see
07:38 - this is the barebone code to create a
07:41 - simple nodejs server so this is what we
07:45 - are going to do so first of all for
07:47 - example I will CD to the desktop and
07:51 - here we will create a file so I'm going
07:53 - to create a file for example I will just
07:56 - say Get it which is a editor
08:00 - and for example I am going to create a
08:03 - file called
08:05 - app.js okay and press enter which is
08:08 - going to create
08:10 - a app.js file on the desktop so whenever
08:14 - we will copy so we will copy all this um
08:18 - code from here which is there on the
08:21 - website and we will paste it here and
08:24 - save it so once you save it you can see
08:27 - this app.js is created Creed here right
08:30 - this app.js file okay so now what we
08:34 - want to do is we want to run this app.js
08:39 - file so you can just write node and the
08:42 - file name which is app.js right and then
08:46 - press enter which is going to run your
08:49 - server now if you can see here there is
08:52 - a message server running at this port so
08:55 - this is uh the Local Host 127.0.0.1
08:59 - .1 is the local host and this is the
09:02 - port 3,000 is the port on which nodejs
09:05 - is running right now so if you want you
09:07 - can just uh copy this uh address or you
09:11 - can type it on your uh you know on your
09:14 - browser also so what I'm going to do is
09:17 - I'm going to just paste this which is
09:19 - 127.0.0.1
09:21 - colon 3000 which is the port and press
09:25 - enter and it prints hello world right
09:28 - and this was the purpose of of uh this
09:30 - barebone uh you know uh code which is to
09:34 - print hello world you can see it's
09:37 - prints hello world here okay so this is
09:40 - how we know that note is running
09:43 - successfully on our window operating
09:45 - system and we have installed nodejs
09:48 - correctly on our system so I hope youve
09:49 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
09:51 - subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can download and install nodejs on our Ubuntu operating system and we will also see how we can uh
