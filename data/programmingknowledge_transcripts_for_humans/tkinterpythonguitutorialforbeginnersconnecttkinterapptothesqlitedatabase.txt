00:00 - a Lopez and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge the previous video we learned
00:06 - about how to create a registration form
00:09 - and take the inputs from the user and a
00:12 - friendly to the console so this video
00:15 - will bitching about how to take that
00:18 - data and store it within a database so
00:22 - for that you need first of all is a
00:25 - SQLite tree browser so we sqlite3
00:28 - database which is a database provided in
00:33 - pythons you just import it normally
00:36 - don't have to use any fee procedure so I
00:40 - just import it and so we have a previous
00:46 - function that is a print e and D so
00:51 - commented out and create a new function
00:54 - that is function database and here we'll
01:03 - write everything regarding the on
01:05 - database procedures so just follow along
01:12 - everything will be everything will
01:15 - remain the same just you have to add
01:17 - another function so and okay so now take
01:28 - a variable name one is equal to F n dot
01:34 - and get on this function on this and
01:41 - will function greatly affects the value
01:43 - from that widget and the widget now you
01:47 - can use the last one is equal to hell
01:53 - then Lord get same you can just copy
01:58 - this then you can take it for the date
02:08 - little good lord get then create another
02:15 - variable for country is equal to Lord
02:21 - get then you can create tinea for
02:27 - programming languages of your choice
02:29 - gender is equal to well let's try to
02:40 - don't have to get use get metroid in
02:44 - this because you already mentioned over
02:46 - here fighting and java as you can see so
02:51 - moving on forward we'll be using it for
02:56 - gender now that is a radio button radio
03:01 - or to web ordinate okay so I guess we
03:08 - are done with fetchingly tales from the
03:09 - widgets now we will just let the
03:13 - procedure for the hub is connectivity so
03:16 - use a variable of your choice I'm using
03:22 - on is equal to sqlite3 not connect so
03:29 - usually this is the procedure for
03:31 - connecting with the database and in here
03:35 - we'll be mentioning the database name
03:37 - for example we perform on baby
03:47 - now with calm and the colon then he will
03:55 - lose Inco so for it is this is disabled
04:01 - on basic procedures will be to perform
04:06 - is equal to con dot course also you will
04:11 - find this in the documentation of
04:12 - sqlite3 this other man duty procedures
04:16 - to create a database along with the
04:19 - table and etc
04:21 - and now from here we'll be starting to
04:28 - create a table for that cursor Lord
04:33 - execute so this statement of line will
04:37 - be used to create a table so follow
04:39 - along execute em so everything will be
04:50 - capital D is table if not exist okay and
05:09 - the table name will be student then is a
05:21 - bracket the column name first name then
05:29 - we'll be providing a data output text
05:34 - then we'll be using last name then here
05:37 - is just your word in the column Leon
05:39 - nothing much
05:40 - with along with editor type these are
05:42 - the basic SQL procedures in from date on
05:49 - both text comma for country text
06:04 - [Music]
06:08 - should be in uppercase
06:13 - you
06:16 - you
06:24 - drink and then for programming column to
06:28 - convention any name you want and text
06:37 - for that then for gender and here we'll
06:49 - be finishing off the table that's it for
06:59 - the table now we'll move on to the
07:02 - inserting values that we are fetching
07:05 - from here for example for in here we are
07:09 - taking the variables name last one date
07:13 - of birth and we are using the get method
07:15 - to get that data from that widgets which
07:18 - are being used in the interface so
07:22 - follow along same procedure will be
07:25 - using cursor and God execute and for the
07:31 - insult
07:32 - wheezing insert into student table names
07:40 - and mention the columns that you have
07:49 - used above laughs as same as this like
07:55 - this last a Oh gob n etc and last then
08:03 - we'll be using our TOB then country then
08:10 - programming comma gender okay so just a
08:17 - list check anything is right okay
08:20 - everything is right and just remove this
08:28 - and
08:33 - these values what rights are going to
08:36 - get inserted into that table so values
08:41 - then will be facing pushing Mount
08:44 - Rushmore
08:45 - engaged on the number of columns for
08:47 - example here there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 so
08:52 - here are the empty values so based on
09:02 - the number of columns that is named last
09:05 - date of birth control program program
09:09 - and gender death is 6 column will be
09:12 - using 6 question marks and so and we
09:29 - sing the variables that we are using to
09:34 - fetch the data that is over here so we
09:41 - are using this variable to get the data
09:44 - from those widgets just use the antenna
09:49 - 2 1 comma gate from country form make
10:03 - sure that the variable name are same
10:06 - okay comma gender so 6 widgets and 6 and
10:19 - we are getting from that get method ok
10:22 - and focus I guess to the creation of the
10:30 - table as well as the insertion of value
10:33 - who think that table student is done so
10:35 - this is the function used for inserting
10:39 - that it ends with database one more
10:43 - method is left that is we need to commit
10:47 - whatever I am terms will just use this
10:50 - commit method to save all the data which
10:53 - is saved into the database and use this
10:58 - function database into the
11:01 - you
11:06 - button that is over here that is a login
11:08 - button so here we are using the login
11:11 - button to execute that database program
11:18 - or will function here I am also using
11:20 - the key binding method in Kindle so for
11:24 - example if I press enter
11:28 - instead of taking on to the mouse you
11:31 - can also use Enter key to execute that
11:34 - command so it's not I'll just save it
11:37 - and run so I guess there is no error so
11:45 - let's enter some data country yeah
12:00 - fighting and real so there is some error
12:08 - let's see what they say
12:13 - so this let's let's
12:24 - you
12:29 - so the issue is over here.i programming
12:33 - P is kept low over there we are used
12:36 - this outage so I guess it is done save
12:42 - this and execute again
12:52 - okay so that's we enter the data let's
12:56 - see there is any error home on
13:05 - this put some random data
13:10 - you
13:11 - you
13:16 - still there is some error so the number
13:25 - of our empty values is five and we have
13:29 - six phones
13:34 - you
13:39 - let's use one more which I'll save and
13:44 - try again
13:53 - okay I should be 10 by 9 so this puts in
14:01 - angle beta gamma country okay so I guess
14:14 - the database is created with the center
14:18 - go on more data
14:26 - Sami personal data rates
14:33 - this change
14:39 - and this okay so we have created the
14:45 - table and inserted values within this so
14:49 - let's check the table so for that you
14:54 - can use this
14:59 - so here is a forward DB so to check
15:03 - whether the values are within the table
15:06 - or not use
15:09 - you
15:17 - you sleep in browser or SQLite
15:22 - we'll be back for SQLite and open
15:26 - database and we'll go to desktop this is
15:35 - the database as you can see this is a
15:41 - table student and now we have the
15:43 - columns over data types so as you can
15:47 - see we're here in this other columns
15:48 - name last date of birth country
15:53 - programming and gender so this is data
15:57 - as we have fetched through the inputs of
16:02 - other widgets of Pinter so the procedure
16:09 - of creating the database is done we have
16:12 - successfully insert data within it so
16:15 - this is it put the pool for this video
16:18 - will be available in the description and
16:20 - this is it for this video guys and
16:22 - thanks for watching

we'll be using our TOB then country then programming comma gender okay so just a list check anything is right okay everything is right and just remove this and these values what rights are going to get inserted into that table so values then will be facing pushing Mount Rushmore engaged on the number of columns for example here there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 so here are the empty values so based on the number of columns that is named last date of birth control program program and gender death is 6 column will be using 6 question marks and so and we sing the variables that we are using to fetch the data that is over here so we are using this variable to get the data from those widgets just use the antenna 2 1 comma gate from country form make sure that the variable name are same okay comma gender so 6 widgets and 6 and we are getting from that get method ok and focus I guess to the creation of the table as well as the insertion of value who think that table student is done so this is
