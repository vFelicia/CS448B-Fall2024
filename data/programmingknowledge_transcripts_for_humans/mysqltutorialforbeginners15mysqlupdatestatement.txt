00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video I will show you
00:05 - how to update the tables once you have
00:09 - created the table and after that you
00:12 - insert the values in those tables but
00:15 - there will be scenarios where you want
00:18 - to update the value or modify the table
00:20 - so how do you do that let us first see
00:24 - how to do it in a terminal so first of
00:28 - all open your terminal - you'll - you
00:44 - okay so let us see which are three
00:47 - databases we have here you can see we
00:54 - have data types data means use data test
01:03 - which are the tables that we have we
01:08 - have one table struck so select star
01:12 - from student here you can see these are
01:18 - the records now let me change the roll
01:24 - number of mark student okay so I want to
01:30 - change the roll number of the student
01:32 - named mark and the roll number is now
01:37 - five but I want to make it let's say 19
01:42 - okay so write update because you want to
01:48 - update the table then the name of the
01:51 - table that you want to update or modify
01:58 - then set
02:02 - after that you need to provide the
02:04 - column name that you want to modify in
02:07 - our case we want to modify the role
02:09 - number field so right roll number set
02:17 - roll number is equal to 19 now where to
02:22 - insert the new report which is 19 roll
02:27 - number that we want to specify by we're
02:30 - close we're roll number let's say name
02:38 - is equal to MA
02:45 - so under the under understand tick very
02:49 - first update because we want to update
02:53 - the table then name of the table which
02:56 - is children set after that the column
03:02 - name which we want to modify and after
03:05 - that the name of the column by which can
03:08 - identify the couple which we want to
03:14 - modify okay so let us see what happen
03:19 - okay one row affected now we see here
03:25 - you can see the table is modified now
03:28 - this student mark is now role number of
03:33 - 19 okay
03:38 - let us see one more example update
03:48 - stolen
03:51 - sad now the instant name difficult
04:03 - let's say breech where let's say surname
04:15 - which is equal to shop so say name is
04:23 - equal to bridge where surname is equal
04:25 - to sorry so here is the table the
04:30 - surname is shock and name is pigeon so
04:33 - it will change the name field to beach
04:37 - okay
04:45 - yeah you can see
04:49 - so let's quit now and open my apartment
05:06 - okay so let's say select to start okay
05:16 - it's art about this now a bit then this
05:23 - student the name of the table of the
05:28 - student said roll number is equal to
05:40 - let's say 20 where it again we use roll
05:47 - number field where roll number is 19
05:52 - okay so said roll number 20 where
05:56 - current roll number is 19 so mark has 19
06:04 - roll number as of now and if we and
06:07 - after the updation it has roll number of
06:11 - not 20 okay so far this very one bra
06:16 - factor
06:20 - as you can see you can perform one more
06:28 - operation like update student said
06:42 - a roll number is equal to roll number
06:53 - plus one so understand the query first
06:58 - update student you want to update the
07:01 - student level set roll number is equal
07:05 - to roll number plus one it means it will
07:08 - increment the roll number by one but
07:12 - question is which are the roll numbers
07:16 - that will be increased here we have not
07:20 - specified and if we're closed so by
07:23 - default it will update all the tuples or
07:26 - rolls that available in this preventable
07:30 - so what it will do it will increment
07:33 - each roll number by one let us see sea
07:38 - water
07:46 - as you can see an error is occurring you
07:51 - are using save update model now in order
07:56 - to remove the safe update mode go to
07:59 - your Maskull watch band preferences
08:03 - SQL editor here you can see safe updates
08:08 - just disable it okay now you need to
08:15 - restart your MySQL workbench
08:21 - I changed roll number +1 to roll number
08:26 - + 500
08:27 - because in earlier when we want to set
08:34 - it to roll number + 1 what happens that
08:37 - if roll number is our primary key and
08:40 - some of the columns may increase and set
08:45 - it to the value that has already present
08:48 - in those table okay
08:51 - so update student set roll number is
08:56 - equal to roll number plus 504 this will
09:04 - let us see as you can see it starts from
09:12 - 500 onwards now so this is all about how
09:17 - do you update your table or modify the
09:19 - columns in your table thanks for
09:22 - watching

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video I will show you how to update the tables once you have created the table and after that you insert the values in those tables but there will be scenarios where you want to update the value or modify the table so how do you do that let us first see how to do it in a terminal so first of all open your terminal you'll you okay so let us see which are three databases we have here you can see we have data types data means use data test which are the tables that we have we have one table struck so select star from student here you can see these are the records now let me change the roll number of mark student okay so I want to change the roll number of the student named mark and the roll number is now five but I want to make it let's say 19 okay so write update because you want to update the table then the name of the table that you want to update or modify then set after that you need to provide the column name that you want to modify in our case we want to modify the role number field so right roll number set roll number is equal to 19 now where to insert the new report which is 19 roll number that we want to specify by we're close we're roll number let's say name is equal to MA so under the under understand tick very first update because we want to update the table then name of the table which is children set after that the column name which we want to modify and after that the name of the column by which can identify the couple which we want to modify okay so let us see what happen okay one row affected now we see here you can see the table is modified now this student mark is now role number of 19 okay let us see one more example update stolen sad now the instant name difficult let's say breech where let's say surname which is equal to shop so say name is equal to bridge where surname is equal to sorry so here is the table the surname is shock and name is pigeon so it will change the name field to beach okay yeah you can see so let's quit now and open my apartment okay so let's say select to start okay it's art about this now a bit then this student the name of the table of the student said roll number is equal to let's say 20 where it again we use roll number field where roll number is 19 okay so said roll number 20 where current roll number is 19 so mark has 19 roll number as of now and if we and after the updation it has roll number of not 20 okay so far this very one bra factor as you can see you can perform one more operation like update student said a roll number is equal to roll number plus one so understand the query first update student you want to update the student level set roll number is equal to roll number plus one it means it will increment the roll number by one but question is which are the roll numbers that will be increased here we have not specified and if we're closed so by default it will update all the tuples or rolls that available in this preventable so what it will do it will increment each roll number by one let us see sea water as you can see an error is occurring you are using save update model now in order to remove the safe update mode go to your Maskull watch band preferences SQL editor here you can see safe updates just disable it okay now you need to restart your MySQL workbench I changed roll number +1 to roll number + 500 because in earlier when we want to set it to roll number + 1 what happens that if roll number is our primary key and some of the columns may increase and set it to the value that has already present in those table okay so update student set roll number is equal to roll number plus 504 this will let us see as you can see it starts from 500 onwards now so this is all about how do you update your table or modify the columns in your table thanks for watching
