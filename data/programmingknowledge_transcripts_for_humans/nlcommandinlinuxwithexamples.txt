00:00 - now in this video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the basic command that is NL
00:03 - command okay so basically this is a very
00:05 - simple command okay but sometimes it's
00:08 - useful for Linux administrators in some
00:10 - cases okay so we will see the one use
00:13 - case and but before that we will create
00:14 - on file let me give the name as
00:17 - names.txt I will write some names here
00:21 - ayush and Avinash
00:24 - and uh Harry
00:27 - and I will write Ron
00:31 - and again let's take some another name
00:33 - that is uh
00:36 - me okay I will use Ctrl D to save and
00:40 - now I'll just read this file names.txt
00:42 - but in this case you can see like there
00:44 - is no numbering here
00:46 - but sometimes we need to just get
00:49 - numbering like if you suppose this is a
00:52 - code
00:53 - uh if there is a code file and you need
00:56 - some numbering in that then we use this
00:59 - NL command to get the
01:02 - numbers so here you can see that one two
01:05 - three four five
01:06 - is this dead here okay so suppose if I
01:09 - create an another file that is index dot
01:12 - X HTML
01:15 - right like body and I'll write this H1
01:20 - hello world
01:23 - and I'll just close the body
01:27 - Ctrl D to save and we'll just read the
01:29 - file cat index.html and you can see this
01:32 - we are able to read but now I want the
01:35 - line number of this file like of this
01:37 - code sometimes what happens uh like uh
01:42 - we get some kind of error in a
01:45 - particular line of code so in this case
01:47 - it is useful to like debug that error
01:49 - I'll use this NL and I will just provide
01:52 - the name of the file what was it
01:54 - index.html and here you can see there
01:57 - one two three line number
01:58 - okay so I hope you got the value what
02:01 - will be the what can be the use of this
02:02 - NL command but yeah it's very simple so
02:05 - that's all for today's video guys and we
02:07 - will meet you in the next video uh with
02:09 - some amazing commands
02:11 - so that's all for today's video and
02:14 - we'll meet you next one thank you thank
02:15 - you for watching we'll meet you in the
02:17 - next video thank you
