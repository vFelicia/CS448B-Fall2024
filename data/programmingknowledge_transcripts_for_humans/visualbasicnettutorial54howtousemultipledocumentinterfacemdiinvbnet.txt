00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can use multiple
00:04 - document interface or MDI with your
00:08 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:11 - let's get started to start with I have a
00:14 - sample project which is a blank project
00:17 - so just make a blank project which have
00:20 - only one form which is form one. DB or
00:23 - VB sorry okay and in order to make this
00:29 - uh MDI container or multiple document
00:31 - interface container you just need to
00:34 - select this form and you need to go to
00:36 - the property and search for the property
00:39 - called is MDI container by default this
00:42 - property is false so just search for the
00:45 - property called is MDI container and
00:47 - make it true so I will make it true and
00:50 - you will instantly see the change in
00:53 - your form and it becomes a MDI container
00:56 - now in order to uh implement child in
01:00 - this MDI container child's in this MDI
01:03 - container I will make two new forms form
01:07 - two and form three so I will just click
01:10 - my project right click it and I will add
01:14 - new item and I will select Windows Form
01:17 - here and I will leave it as form 2. VB
01:22 - so I've created one more form which is
01:24 - called form two and let me make it make
01:29 - a new form form which is called form 3.
01:32 - VB and which is a Windows Form okay so
01:36 - I've created two more form form two and
01:38 - form three which I will use them as a
01:42 - child okay so now what I need to do is I
01:47 - will go to my first form and let's uh
01:50 - use menu strip for opening form two and
01:55 - form three inside our form one which is
01:58 - our MDI p parent so I will just drag and
02:02 - drop menu strip from here my from my
02:05 - toolbox and in here it will create this
02:08 - menu strip I will just name it as
02:13 - new and I will just go to here and I
02:16 - will
02:17 - say form
02:20 - two and
02:23 - form
02:25 - three now I will just select my form two
02:28 - item which is this item
02:30 - and I will go to the event and I will
02:33 - just click on this click event okay
02:37 - which is already selected just double
02:39 - click in this box two times and you will
02:43 - reach to the form two tool strip menu
02:47 - item _ click event and in here what I
02:51 - need to do is I will need to declare an
02:54 - instance of form two so I will write dim
02:58 - F2
03:01 - as
03:03 - new
03:05 - form
03:08 - two and now we need to uh specify that
03:13 - which is parent of this F2 or which is
03:18 - the MDI parent of uh this F2 so right
03:21 - now we are in form one right which is a
03:26 - parent okay so this is a parent form one
03:29 - and we have gone to this button click
03:32 - event of form two tool strip item okay
03:37 - so just write
03:39 - F2 do MDI
03:44 - parent is equal to me why we have
03:48 - written me here because it's the same
03:51 - form form one okay so form one is the
03:54 - parent MDI parent of form two okay
03:57 - that's why I've written MD parent is
04:00 - equal to me and then just we need to
04:03 - show it so F2 dot
04:06 - show okay the same thing I will do with
04:09 - for form three so just select form three
04:13 - menu uh Manu strip item and just go to
04:17 - event and just go to this click event
04:20 - and double click this and we will reach
04:23 - to the form three tool strip menu item
04:26 - click event and I will copy the same
04:29 - code here but I need to change this
04:32 - instance to form three F3 F3 and this
04:38 - will be form
04:40 - three okay so just I I have a written
04:46 - the same code but I have changed it for
04:48 - form three now when I run the
04:54 - program it's it's opening form one which
04:58 - is my MDI parent right and now it has
05:01 - menu strip and when I click this form
05:04 - two it should
05:05 - open form two inside my form one which
05:10 - is MDI parent so let's click it and you
05:13 - can see form two is created inside my
05:17 - form one okay let's create form three so
05:21 - I will click form three and you can see
05:23 - form 3 is created here and I can
05:26 - minimize
05:27 - it you can see here
05:30 - and I can maximize it also okay so form
05:35 - three and form
05:38 - two okay and I can create multiple
05:41 - instances of form two and form three
05:44 - it's not that only one instance will be
05:47 - open so you can see
05:53 - here two instance of form two are open
05:56 - right now same as for form three two
05:59 - instance of form three are open right
06:01 - now so multiple instances of forms we
06:04 - can open using this method there is code
06:09 - to uh open only one instance at the time
06:13 - you just need to Google it it's uh
06:15 - really easy uh to find this kind of code
06:19 - and you can optimize your project
06:22 - according to the multiple document
06:26 - interface in Visual Basic so I hope you
06:29 - have enjoyed this video please RIT

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can use multiple document interface or MDI with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so let's get started to start with I have a sample project which is a blank project so just make a blank project which have only one form which is form one. DB or VB sorry okay and in order to make this uh MDI container or multiple document interface container you just need to select this form and you need to go to the property and search for the property called is MDI container by default this property is false so just search for the property called is MDI container and make it true so I will make it true and you will instantly see the change in your form and it becomes a MDI container now in order to uh implement child in this MDI container child's in this MDI container I will make two new forms form two and form three so I will just click my project right click it and I will add new item and I will select Windows Form here and I will leave it as form 2. VB so I've created one more form which is called form two and let me make it make a new form form which is called form 3. VB and which is a Windows Form okay so I've created two more form form two and form three which I will use them as a child okay so now what I need to do is I will go to my first form and let's uh use menu strip for opening form two and form three inside our form one which is our MDI p parent so I will just drag and drop menu strip from here my from my toolbox and in here it will create this menu strip I will just name it as new and I will just go to here and I will say form two and form three now I will just select my form two item which is this item and I will go to the event and I will just click on this click event okay which is already selected just double click in this box two times and you will reach to the form two tool strip menu item _ click event and in here what I need to do is I will need to declare an instance of form two so I will write dim F2 as new form two and now we need to uh specify that which is parent of this F2 or which is the MDI parent of uh this F2 so right now we are in form one right which is a parent okay so this is a parent form one and we have gone to this button click event of form two tool strip item okay so just write F2 do MDI parent is equal to me why we have written me here because it's the same form form one okay so form one is the parent MDI parent of form two okay that's why I've written MD parent is equal to me and then just we need to show it so F2 dot show okay the same thing I will do with for form three so just select form three menu uh Manu strip item and just go to event and just go to this click event and double click this and we will reach to the form three tool strip menu item click event and I will copy the same code here but I need to change this instance to form three F3 F3 and this will be form three okay so just I I have a written the same code but I have changed it for form three now when I run the program it's it's opening form one which is my MDI parent right and now it has menu strip and when I click this form two it should open form two inside my form one which is MDI parent so let's click it and you can see form two is created inside my form one okay let's create form three so I will click form three and you can see form 3 is created here and I can minimize it you can see here and I can maximize it also okay so form three and form two okay and I can create multiple instances of form two and form three it's not that only one instance will be open so you can see here two instance of form two are open right now same as for form three two instance of form three are open right now so multiple instances of forms we can open using this method there is code to uh open only one instance at the time you just need to Google it it's uh really easy uh to find this kind of code and you can optimize your project according to the multiple document interface in Visual Basic so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
