00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - while loop in C now in this video I'm
00:07 - going to show you how to use do while
00:10 - loop in
00:12 - C so first of all what is a difference
00:16 - between while loop and do while loop the
00:21 - basic difference between while loop and
00:23 - do while loop is a y Loop first checks
00:28 - the condition and then performs the code
00:32 - but the do while loop first performs the
00:36 - code and then checks the condition so
00:40 - let me give you an example I'm going to
00:44 - just use the example I have used last
00:47 - time to print 10 values and Ive also
00:50 - shown you how to print 10 values using
00:52 - this V Loop right
00:56 - so while this count was less than
01:00 - whatever we entered as a number for
01:02 - example 10 it will been printing the
01:04 - values right and for example I will just
01:09 - increase this count to 10 so now I I
01:13 - have initialized this count variable
01:15 - with 10 then what happens is I will run
01:20 - the
01:21 - code and for example I enter the number
01:24 - nine and press enter and you see nothing
01:28 - happens because our condition is not
01:31 - true 10 is not not less than n which we
01:35 - have entered so our code is not executed
01:40 - right now let me
01:45 - just rewrite this code using do while
01:49 - loop okay so let's see a do while
01:54 - declaration is like this you first write
01:58 - do and then then you give this two curly
02:02 - braces and
02:04 - then what you do here is you
02:08 - write while and your condition and this
02:14 - semicolon okay this is the basic
02:16 - structure of two while loop and I will
02:19 - just give the same condition here in the
02:23 - while loop so I have the condition count
02:25 - is less than this number and I have the
02:28 - same statement which I was performing
02:31 - last time and once again let's see what
02:34 - happens now to differentiate this print
02:40 - message I will write
02:43 - here while and I will write here do
02:49 - while so we don't we will know that
02:52 - which message is printed this one or
02:55 - this one now let's run the program once
02:58 - again once again we will give the value
03:01 - nine which will be less than 10 so I
03:05 - will give nine and press enter and you
03:09 - see here the message printed do while
03:12 - number 10 right so this message is
03:17 - printed this one do while message and
03:21 - while message is not printed so this
03:25 - means that while loop first of all
03:28 - checks the condition
03:30 - and then execute your code and do while
03:33 - loop first execute your code so it will
03:37 - just because there is no condition in
03:40 - initially right it says do so you do
03:43 - this and then it sees okay this is the
03:47 - condition if this condition is true I'm
03:50 - going to go to do once again and print
03:55 - this now let's give the value valid
04:00 - conditions for both of them okay so I
04:04 - will just run the code and I will give
04:08 - 10 and I will enter this once
04:13 - again and it says
04:16 - while 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 it says do
04:22 - while is equal to 10 okay
04:26 - so you see why this is happening
04:32 - because all the because this is this
04:35 - variable and this variable is same right
04:38 - so this has already increased to 10 and
04:42 - at the time of reaching this code this
04:45 - value is already 10 right so this code
04:49 - will be performed and it sees that 10
04:53 - is not less than 10 it's equal to 10
04:57 - right so it will not repeat it once
04:59 - again but when you declare uh another
05:04 - variable you can call it count one and
05:07 - just copy it and paste it with this do
05:13 - while loop what it will do is I will
05:18 - just run the code once again and I will
05:22 - press and 10 and press enter and you can
05:26 - see it has printed in the while loop
05:30 - also while 0 to 9 and in the do while
05:33 - loop also 0 to 9 same values right but
05:38 - the basic difference is do while
05:41 - loop performs the code first or perform
05:44 - the statement first and then the checks
05:47 - the condition and if the condition is
05:48 - true it goes to the statement once again
05:51 - and if the condition is true it goes to
05:53 - the statement once again and on the
05:57 - other hand the while loop checks the
05:59 - condition first and then performs your
06:02 - statement so I hope you have understood
06:05 - the basic difference between do and do
06:07 - while
06:08 - loop not do and do while loop but while
06:11 - and do while loop and I hope you have

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to use while loop in C now in this video I'm going to show you how to use do while loop in C so first of all what is a difference between while loop and do while loop the basic difference between while loop and do while loop is a y Loop first checks the condition and then performs the code but the do while loop first performs the code and then checks the condition so let me give you an example I'm going to just use the example I have used last time to print 10 values and Ive also shown you how to print 10 values using this V Loop right so while this count was less than whatever we entered as a number for example 10 it will been printing the values right and for example I will just increase this count to 10 so now I I have initialized this count variable with 10 then what happens is I will run the code and for example I enter the number nine and press enter and you see nothing happens because our condition is not true 10 is not not less than n which we have entered so our code is not executed right now let me just rewrite this code using do while loop okay so let's see a do while declaration is like this you first write do and then then you give this two curly braces and then what you do here is you write while and your condition and this semicolon okay this is the basic structure of two while loop and I will just give the same condition here in the while loop so I have the condition count is less than this number and I have the same statement which I was performing last time and once again let's see what happens now to differentiate this print message I will write here while and I will write here do while so we don't we will know that which message is printed this one or this one now let's run the program once again once again we will give the value nine which will be less than 10 so I will give nine and press enter and you see here the message printed do while number 10 right so this message is printed this one do while message and while message is not printed so this means that while loop first of all checks the condition and then execute your code and do while loop first execute your code so it will just because there is no condition in initially right it says do so you do this and then it sees okay this is the condition if this condition is true I'm going to go to do once again and print this now let's give the value valid conditions for both of them okay so I will just run the code and I will give 10 and I will enter this once again and it says while 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 it says do while is equal to 10 okay so you see why this is happening because all the because this is this variable and this variable is same right so this has already increased to 10 and at the time of reaching this code this value is already 10 right so this code will be performed and it sees that 10 is not less than 10 it's equal to 10 right so it will not repeat it once again but when you declare uh another variable you can call it count one and just copy it and paste it with this do while loop what it will do is I will just run the code once again and I will press and 10 and press enter and you can see it has printed in the while loop also while 0 to 9 and in the do while loop also 0 to 9 same values right but the basic difference is do while loop performs the code first or perform the statement first and then the checks the condition and if the condition is true it goes to the statement once again and if the condition is true it goes to the statement once again and on the other hand the while loop checks the condition first and then performs your statement so I hope you have understood the basic difference between do and do while loop not do and do while loop but while and do while loop and I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
