00:00 - hey everyone so today we'll be talking
00:02 - about pie game in python
00:04 - that is basically used for working with
00:06 - video games
00:08 - creating video games in python
00:10 - but before that we need some
00:12 - prerequisites that
00:15 - your knowledge in python you should
00:18 - already be acquainted with some basic
00:20 - idea of python
00:22 - then you should
00:24 - have python installed in your system if
00:27 - not i'll just guide you through some
00:30 - quick steps we'd be working on bs code
00:33 - so with we need vs code we'd need
00:36 - uh python installed in your systems plus
00:38 - we'd need the pi pi game module so let's
00:42 - quickly see how we can
00:45 - get all these
00:47 - and
00:48 - we'll find you'll find this download
00:50 - pythonpython.org it's the official
00:52 - website
00:53 - if you need any documentation related
00:56 - help
00:57 - from python about python then you can
01:00 - search it her hair
01:01 - so you're going to click on this link
01:03 - okay and you can easily download it like
01:06 - it starts right away and then you have
01:09 - to
01:10 - set the environment variable which is
01:13 - not a big deal and uh for downloading vs
01:16 - code you write download vs code
01:22 - and there we are
01:25 - we download vs code
01:28 - and it should start right away uh you
01:30 - just have to wait for some time
01:34 - okay so as you launch vs code this is
01:37 - what we get this is the interface that
01:39 - we see
01:41 - this is where you open all the folders
01:43 - this is where you search for your files
01:46 - and this is where you
01:48 - download your extensions so
01:51 - since if
01:52 - we are working maybe you are working
01:55 - with python for the first time you have
01:57 - downloaded it for the first time
01:58 - you have to write python
02:01 - and download the extension so that you
02:04 - can work with vs code and
02:06 - python
02:09 - here i am getting this disable and
02:11 - install uh icons because i have already
02:13 - installed this extension but if you have
02:16 - not you'll get an install button over
02:19 - here so you click on it and then once it
02:22 - is installed you get a reload button so
02:24 - you reload it so that you can work with
02:26 - python on vs code so
02:29 - i need to open a folder
02:34 - and so i've
02:37 - opened a folder here
02:39 - uh which i've named as python it's an
02:42 - empty folder i made on the desktop
02:44 - a very simple one it contains nothing
02:47 - and it'll get opened
02:49 - as soon as i click on this
02:52 - and then
02:56 - we will add a new file this is how we
02:58 - add a new file we'll name it first
03:01 - why
03:04 - you always need to give extensions dot
03:06 - py is the extension for a python file
03:08 - you tell vs code that you're gonna work
03:11 - with
03:12 - python you might
03:15 - you might say that you will only have
03:17 - python extension so why do we need to
03:19 - mention dot py but maybe
03:22 - when you learn a lot of languages you
03:24 - have a lot of extensions
03:26 - then it would be a confusion for vs code
03:29 - what
03:31 - file you're working with so
03:33 - you need to mention the extension you
03:36 - need to mention dot py
03:38 - for htmlv.do we do dot html so
03:43 - yeah
03:44 - uh let's try to print something
03:48 - we'll print hello
03:50 - let's see let's run this
03:52 - let's see if it runs
03:59 - and we have our hello printed
04:01 - cool
04:02 - this is what we needed
04:04 - now we'll install
04:07 - pygame
04:11 - so to install pygame
04:13 - you need to
04:14 - write on the command prompt on the
04:16 - terminal that um
04:19 - okay please open command prompt while
04:21 - you're doing this
04:22 - do not work on powershell
04:25 - yes you should see something like this
04:28 - and you'll write pip
04:30 - install
04:32 - by key
04:37 - i already have pi games so i don't need
04:39 - to install it separately but
04:42 - just on the just to be on the safer side
04:44 - just run this command and see that you
04:46 - have buy game or install this
04:49 - this is the only command that you need
04:50 - to run there are no
04:52 - extra commands that you need to run for
04:54 - downloading buying game it's really
04:55 - simple
04:57 - now we'll move on to the
05:00 - coding and
05:01 - introduction part of pygame
05:04 - so
05:04 - let's get to it
05:08 - so
05:09 - i have made this little code for you
05:13 - so that you can understand
05:15 - how we work with pygame
05:17 - first of all the interaction of pygame
05:20 - it is a python module that is
05:23 - for creating video games you can create
05:26 - a new number of video games like the
05:28 - snake game tic-tac-toe
05:31 - you can make any space shooter game
05:34 - you can
05:35 - visualize
05:37 - moving objects
05:38 - you can draw
05:40 - shapes
05:41 - and you can do a lot of stuff with my
05:43 - game it has a lot of functions a lot of
05:45 - methods
05:46 - it works really efficiently with latest
05:49 - version of my
05:50 - python
05:52 - what i have done is
05:54 - that
05:55 - i have divided any by game code into
06:00 - three basic steps
06:01 - that is importing by game initializing
06:04 - by game it was one
06:06 - setting up the screen on which we would
06:08 - see the output
06:10 - and running the game loop
06:12 - okay
06:13 - so you might not get the idea of setting
06:15 - up the screen and the game loop we'll
06:17 - get to it
06:18 - slowly so first of all importing
06:22 - importing a module
06:24 - this is how you do it in python you
06:27 - write import and then you
06:29 - write the name of the module that you
06:30 - want to import
06:31 - then we have this initialization part
06:37 - that is by game dot init don't worry
06:40 - about from pytheme dot locals
06:42 - it's another
06:44 - method of buying we'll talk about it
06:47 - later
06:48 - then we write by game dot in it we
06:50 - always write it because we want to call
06:52 - all the functionalities of pi game
06:56 - and want to work with it
06:59 - like this play is one of them
07:01 - dot display
07:03 - we then set up a screen the second point
07:07 - uh this is how we do it we call on to pi
07:10 - game we get into display this is one
07:15 - module in
07:16 - inside pi game
07:19 - and then we write dot set mode
07:22 - to
07:22 - set the screen and this is the size of
07:25 - the screen that we get
07:26 - the x-axis and the y-axis okay
07:29 - so
07:32 - okay so then we have
07:35 - the
07:36 - game loop which is an infinite loop
07:39 - and inside it we are first writing
07:41 - screen dot fill
07:43 - with a color code i hope you get that
07:45 - this is an rgb color code if you don't
07:48 - uh don't worry i'll refer you to a
07:49 - website
07:51 - and you can read about it there and we
07:53 - talk about the rgb colors
07:56 - more in the next video
07:59 - and
08:00 - this fill is a method that helps you
08:02 - color the background with this color
08:04 - okay
08:05 - then
08:06 - comes the for loop for the event of the
08:09 - pie game
08:10 - and
08:13 - we talked about this
08:14 - in some time
08:17 - when we'd
08:19 - get some more knowledge about
08:23 - what is happening
08:24 - in this code
08:28 - but for right now just
08:31 - all that you just need to know is there
08:33 - are three basic steps
08:36 - the importing then initializing setting
08:38 - up the screen and having a game loop
08:41 - okay
08:42 - and please set up yourself with
08:45 - uh python and vs code if you if you
08:47 - don't already have them then install
08:49 - pygame
08:51 - and we'll be talking about a lot more uh
08:54 - terminologies and by game and there's a
08:57 - lot to learn
08:58 - fire game is a very vast module and
09:03 - you'll get a really good hands-on to it
09:06 - if you follow this tutorial
09:08 - uh just
09:10 - uh
09:11 - to get an example let's run this this is
09:13 - very simple
09:14 - code and buy game this is a very simple
09:16 - code in pi game i have done literally
09:18 - nothing in this
09:20 - it's just display of a screen
09:22 - just so you do not get like overwhelmed
09:25 - with what is happening i'll just run
09:27 - this and see what
09:28 - we get
09:30 - we get a window
09:32 - that is red in color that we specified
09:35 - two hundred comma zero comma zero
09:37 - and that's all let's begin
09:40 - okay we click cross and uh
09:43 - we can change the
09:45 - [Music]
09:46 - size of this window let's see
09:48 - let's do this 200
09:50 - and 200
09:52 - let's run this now let's see what we get
09:56 - we get a smaller window size
09:59 - you can even see that the maximize icon
10:03 - has been disabled because we cannot
10:05 - maximize this we have already specified
10:08 - the size of this screen and it is 200 by
10:12 - 200
10:13 - so
10:15 - yes this is a live demo of buy game
10:18 - and we'd be doing a lot lot more
10:21 - advanced stuff than just displaying the
10:23 - screen with a color with a basic color
10:27 - we'd be seeing
10:28 - different uh the screen changing colors
10:31 - and
10:32 - a lot more uh
10:33 - making video games
10:35 - and various stuff in buy game till then
10:39 - get your systems
10:40 - ready for working with python
10:43 - and bye game
10:44 - uh see you in the next video

hey everyone so today we'll be talking about pie game in python that is basically used for working with video games creating video games in python but before that we need some prerequisites that your

html so yeah uh let's try to print something we'll print hello let's see let's run this let's see if it runs and we have our hello printed cool this is what we needed now we'll install pygame so to
