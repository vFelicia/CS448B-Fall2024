06:38 - details by click
06:39 - this button what packages are installed
06:42 - here now you may encounter this error

06:50 - this is a very frequent error which can
06:53 - appear when you are installing Android
06:56 - studio which says unable to run MKS D
07:00 - card SDK tools and this is due to if you
07:05 - have a 64-bit operating system and
07:08 - androids needs some 32-bit binary then
07:13 - this error may appear so to solve this
07:17 - error what you can do is I will give you
07:20 - a command and which you can run to
07:23 - install these 32-bit binaries and then
07:27 - you can you know continue with this so

07:32 - Oban do we have so just go to this small
07:35 - button here and go to this option which
07:39 - says about this computer and most
07:42 - probably it's going to show us that West
07:45 - type is 64-bit right so that's why we
07:48 - need to install these extra binaries or
07:52 - to continue working with an Android
07:56 - studio in solution so open our second
08:01 - terminal you can right click and open

09:41 - manager from here and open SDK manager
09:43 - from here itself and it's going to look
09:46 - like this or otherwise you can create a
