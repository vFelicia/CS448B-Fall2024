00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - now in this video we will learn about
00:07 - quotations and citations elements and
00:10 - additionally we will also learn how to
00:13 - use computer code elements in HTML so
00:16 - let's get started so here are some of
00:20 - the tags which you can use as quotations
00:23 - and citation elements and first tag
00:27 - which you can use is abbreviation or
00:30 - abbr
00:31 - and this abbreviation element represents
00:34 - an abbreviation or optionally provides a
00:37 - full description of your text ok now
00:41 - second type of element which you can use
00:43 - is this address and as the name suggests
00:46 - you can use it for describing some
00:48 - address of some old location third type
00:51 - of element which you can use here is BDO
00:55 - or bi-directional override element and
00:59 - using this element you can decide the
01:03 - direction of your text from left to
01:05 - right or right to left right the fourth
01:08 - type of element which you can use here
01:11 - is the is the block quote element and
01:14 - this type of element you can use to
01:18 - quote a section of your paragraph which
01:21 - is taken from some other source ok the
01:25 - next type of element which you can use
01:28 - here is site element or citation element
01:32 - and this element you can use to
01:35 - represent a reference to a creative work
01:38 - for example you want to you know show
01:42 - some ISO code or something like this
01:45 - which has something to do with creative
01:48 - rights then you can use citation element
01:51 - and the last element which you can use
01:54 - is this quotation element which helps
01:57 - you to show a quotation on a line of
02:01 - text ok so let's see how we can use them
02:05 - in real life HTML code so any here you
02:09 - can see I have a paragraph and I use
02:11 - here quotation element
02:13 - here so inside the paragraph you can use
02:15 - this quotation element and this will
02:19 - provide the double quotes around this
02:23 - text which is inside your quotation
02:27 - element right the next type was the
02:30 - block code and if you want to quote some
02:35 - text which you have taken from some
02:38 - website or some other source you can do
02:41 - it inside this block quote element right
02:44 - for example you take this content from
02:48 - the web site then you can use the site
02:51 - attribute and then you can provide the
02:54 - link where you have taken this code from
02:57 - okay so this is block quote now the next
03:02 - type is abbreviation right now for
03:07 - example you want to show the user that
03:11 - this is an HTML text but when he hovers
03:15 - over your HTML text you want to show
03:18 - some description of it or you want to
03:21 - show the full form of HTML which is
03:23 - hypertext markup language then this
03:26 - abbreviation element will help you for
03:29 - this then the next type is the address
03:33 - element and as you can see you can show
03:35 - the address of some place inside this
03:38 - address element the next type is the
03:42 - citation element now you can see here I
03:46 - have a prank Berra graph here more
03:48 - information can be found in ISO 0-0 or
03:52 - whatever ISO number it is right so this
03:55 - is some creative content which I can use
03:59 - inside my web page but I can provide
04:02 - this citation so the reader will know
04:05 - that it is cited from somewhere right
04:08 - now the last type of element which you
04:12 - can use as BDO right
04:14 - so normally when you write a paragraph
04:16 - you will include in this paragraph tag
04:19 - and it will be shown from left to right
04:23 - now
04:24 - in some cases there are some languages
04:26 - which
04:27 - you know start from left to right then
04:30 - you can use this video element inside a
04:33 - paragraph element and you can provide
04:36 - the direction by this attribute called
04:38 - di r is equal to r TL RT L stands for
04:42 - right to left so then your text will be
04:46 - shown from right to left so for example
04:49 - T will come at the extreme left then H
04:53 - then I then s from the left right so
04:57 - let's save our code and let's see how
04:59 - they look on the web page so I will
05:02 - refresh this web page and you can see
05:04 - first was the quotation element and you
05:07 - see double quotes here this paragraph is
05:09 - enclosed by the double quotes second was
05:12 - the block quote and this is was the text
05:16 - which we wanted to show inside the block
05:19 - code so it gives you this quotation now
05:22 - next was the abbreviation element and
05:25 - when you hover over this HTML you can
05:27 - see the description of HTML which we
05:30 - have provided right so it will show you
05:33 - the full form or whatever description
05:35 - you want to provide for this text now
05:39 - next was the address element and this
05:41 - will look like this the next was the
05:44 - citation element and we have included
05:47 - this text inside the citation element
05:50 - and it will look like this the next was
05:53 - the video element or bi-directional
05:56 - override and you can see this text
05:59 - starts from left T starts here then H
06:02 - then I then s so it's from left to right
06:06 - okay so these are some of the citation
06:10 - elements and the quotation elements you
06:12 - can use in HTML now let's see what are
06:16 - the computer code element which we can
06:18 - use in HTML so the first element which
06:21 - you can use for this purpose is the code
06:25 - element itself and this element you can
06:29 - use to include some programming language
06:31 - code right now second element which we
06:36 - can use is kbd element or keyboard input
06:40 - element which we can you
06:41 - use to show the keyboard inputs right
06:45 - the third element which you can use is
06:48 - the sample element and this element
06:51 - intended to identify the sample output
06:54 - from the computer program okay
06:57 - the next element is the variable element
07:00 - and this you can use to represent a
07:03 - mathematical variable okay and the last
07:07 - element we have already seen is the pre
07:10 - element and it preserves your line
07:12 - endings and spaces inside your text okay
07:16 - now let's see how we can use them so I
07:20 - will delete all this code from here now
07:23 - first of all the code element you can
07:25 - use like this so you have the code
07:28 - element and then you can include your
07:30 - code inside this code element now
07:34 - remember that this code element will not
07:37 - preserve your spaces or line endings
07:40 - okay so for that you need to include
07:44 - this code element inside a pre element
07:47 - in order to preserve the line endings
07:50 - and text and that we will see later the
07:54 - next is the kbd element so for example
07:59 - you want to show some keyboard input you
08:02 - can include this inside this kbd element
08:05 - for example you I want to show that I
08:08 - want to press ctrl s then I will include
08:11 - this ctrl + s inside this KBD element
08:15 - and then it will look like a computer
08:17 - input ok next is the variable element
08:22 - and you can include a variable name for
08:24 - example X is equal to y plus 2 for
08:27 - example you can include every letter
08:30 - inside this variable element and it will
08:32 - look like a variable the last is the
08:36 - sample element and we will see how it
08:39 - looks like it will look like a computer
08:42 - output when it's included in this si MP
08:47 - element save this and refresh your
08:50 - webpage and now we can see this here
08:54 - so first was the computer code element
08:57 - and you can see here it's not preserving
09:00 - your spaces or line endings right so
09:03 - first of all we need to include this
09:05 - code inside a pre element right so just
09:10 - include this inside a pre element like
09:14 - this and then save your code and refresh
09:18 - your page and now it will look like this
09:22 - okay now the next was this KBD
09:27 - element and it will look like a computer
09:30 - input like this the next was the
09:32 - variable element and this these
09:34 - variables will look like this and the
09:37 - last was the SI MP element or sample
09:41 - element and the output of this will look
09:44 - like a computer output okay
09:46 - so in this way you can use quotation
09:48 - elements and this computer code elements
09:51 - in HTML I hope you have enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video on HTML tutorial for beginners using html5 now in this video we will learn about quotations and citations elements and additionally we will also learn how to use computer code elements in HTML so let's get started so here are some of the tags which you can use as quotations and citation elements and first tag which you can use is abbreviation or abbr and this abbreviation element represents an abbreviation or optionally provides a full description of your text ok now second type of element which you can use is this address and as the name suggests you can use it for describing some address of some old location third type of element which you can use here is BDO or bidirectional override element and using this element you can decide the direction of your text from left to right or right to left right the fourth type of element which you can use here is the is the block quote element and this type of element you can use to quote a section of your paragraph which is taken from some other source ok the next type of element which you can use here is site element or citation element and this element you can use to represent a reference to a creative work for example you want to you know show some ISO code or something like this which has something to do with creative rights then you can use citation element and the last element which you can use is this quotation element which helps you to show a quotation on a line of text ok so let's see how we can use them in real life HTML code so any here you can see I have a paragraph and I use here quotation element here so inside the paragraph you can use this quotation element and this will provide the double quotes around this text which is inside your quotation element right the next type was the block code and if you want to quote some text which you have taken from some website or some other source you can do it inside this block quote element right for example you take this content from the web site then you can use the site attribute and then you can provide the link where you have taken this code from okay so this is block quote now the next type is abbreviation right now for example you want to show the user that this is an HTML text but when he hovers over your HTML text you want to show some description of it or you want to show the full form of HTML which is hypertext markup language then this abbreviation element will help you for this then the next type is the address element and as you can see you can show the address of some place inside this address element the next type is the citation element now you can see here I have a prank Berra graph here more information can be found in ISO 00 or whatever ISO number it is right so this is some creative content which I can use inside my web page but I can provide this citation so the reader will know that it is cited from somewhere right now the last type of element which you can use as BDO right so normally when you write a paragraph you will include in this paragraph tag and it will be shown from left to right now in some cases there are some languages which you know start from left to right then you can use this video element inside a paragraph element and you can provide the direction by this attribute called di r is equal to r TL RT L stands for right to left so then your text will be shown from right to left so for example T will come at the extreme left then H then I then s from the left right so let's save our code and let's see how they look on the web page so I will refresh this web page and you can see first was the quotation element and you see double quotes here this paragraph is enclosed by the double quotes second was the block quote and this is was the text which we wanted to show inside the block code so it gives you this quotation now next was the abbreviation element and when you hover over this HTML you can see the description of HTML which we have provided right so it will show you the full form or whatever description you want to provide for this text now next was the address element and this will look like this the next was the citation element and we have included this text inside the citation element and it will look like this the next was the video element or bidirectional override and you can see this text starts from left T starts here then H then I then s so it's from left to right okay so these are some of the citation elements and the quotation elements you can use in HTML now let's see what are the computer code element which we can use in HTML so the first element which you can use for this purpose is the code element itself and this element you can use to include some programming language code right now second element which we can use is kbd element or keyboard input element which we can you use to show the keyboard inputs right the third element which you can use is the sample element and this element intended to identify the sample output from the computer program okay the next element is the variable element and this you can use to represent a mathematical variable okay and the last element we have already seen is the pre element and it preserves your line endings and spaces inside your text okay now let's see how we can use them so I will delete all this code from here now first of all the code element you can use like this so you have the code element and then you can include your code inside this code element now remember that this code element will not preserve your spaces or line endings okay so for that you need to include this code element inside a pre element in order to preserve the line endings and text and that we will see later the next is the kbd element so for example you want to show some keyboard input you can include this inside this kbd element for example you I want to show that I want to press ctrl s then I will include this ctrl + s inside this KBD element and then it will look like a computer input ok next is the variable element and you can include a variable name for example X is equal to y plus 2 for example you can include every letter inside this variable element and it will look like a variable the last is the sample element and we will see how it looks like it will look like a computer output when it's included in this si MP element save this and refresh your webpage and now we can see this here so first was the computer code element and you can see here it's not preserving your spaces or line endings right so first of all we need to include this code inside a pre element right so just include this inside a pre element like this and then save your code and refresh your page and now it will look like this okay now the next was this KBD element and it will look like a computer input like this the next was the variable element and this these variables will look like this and the last was the SI MP element or sample element and the output of this will look like a computer output okay so in this way you can use quotation elements and this computer code elements in HTML I hope you have enjoyed this video
