00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - Android mySQL database tutorial for
00:05 - beginners in this video series we are
00:07 - going to learn how we can create an
00:09 - Android app using mySQL database which
00:12 - is running on some web server so let's
00:15 - see what are the requirement first of
00:18 - all we are going to uh need uh mySQL
00:22 - database and then we want to use a web
00:26 - server web server can be an Apache web
00:29 - server or or engine next web server or
00:32 - any other web server we can also use a
00:35 - web server which is running on web
00:38 - hosting right now we are also going to
00:42 - need a server side scripting language in
00:45 - our case we are going to use PHP for
00:48 - serers side scripting so this serers
00:52 - side scripting language will help us to
00:55 - query the database and cater the result
00:59 - and the last we are going to need uh
01:02 - Android development environment which we
01:05 - are already using which is Android
01:07 - studio now there are different ways of
01:11 - uh getting these databases and web
01:15 - server and scripting language together
01:18 - so for testing purposes what we can do
01:21 - is we can uh download and install a WM
01:25 - server and what is a WM server wamp
01:28 - server is a Windows
01:30 - web development environment and it
01:33 - allows you to create a web application
01:36 - with Apache PHP and mySQL database
01:40 - alongside it's also going to give you
01:43 - PHP my admin which allows you to manage
01:46 - your uh database easily okay so this is
01:51 - the first option which we can use for
01:55 - creating our first Android application
01:57 - for and for testing our application now
02:01 - for practical uses we can use web
02:05 - hosting and a server which is running on
02:08 - some web hosting website like uh GoDaddy
02:13 - or HostGator or Google hosting or any
02:16 - other hosting website okay so what is uh
02:21 - web hosting web hosting is a service
02:25 - which uh you can use to you know host
02:29 - your website site and it generally comes
02:32 - with uh you know uh file system and
02:36 - database integrated so we can use uh
02:39 - this web hosting also so I'm going to uh
02:43 - give you uh both examples using uh web
02:47 - web server also and this web hosting
02:50 - also so you can uh create online uh you
02:54 - know mySQL database using Android
02:56 - application right so first of all we are
03:00 - going to create an application using VM
03:02 - server it comes with mySQL Apache and
03:06 - PHP my admin so let's uh download and
03:11 - install WM web server and then we are
03:14 - going to write some PHP scripts to query
03:17 - our database and then we are going to
03:20 - create our Android application so first
03:23 - of all open your favorite browser and
03:25 - search for WM server and the first
03:29 - result most probably which will appear
03:31 - here will be from webs server.com slen
03:36 - for English just click this link
03:39 - here and this is the website from which
03:43 - you can install WM web server so you can
03:48 - read more about web server in here and
03:51 - how you can install it so to download
03:55 - web server executable file you just need
03:57 - to click download uh section here and in
04:01 - here you have two options one is web
04:04 - server for 32bit operating system and
04:09 - second uh is the web server for 64 bit
04:12 - operating system I have 64bit operating
04:15 - system so I'm going to click this uh
04:18 - option right now in here you can uh read
04:22 - the prerequisite for installing the we
04:26 - server so you can read here don't don't
04:29 - use previous web server extension or
04:32 - add-ons so you must not have any other
04:36 - or previous version of web server when
04:39 - you are installing it right the second
04:42 - warning here it says that this web
04:45 - server requires Visual Studio 2012
04:49 - vc11 executable file so to install this
04:54 - web server you need to have Visual
04:55 - Studio 2012
04:58 - vc1 and to download and install it you
05:01 - can just click this link so first of all
05:03 - I'm going to click this uh link to
05:06 - install uh this executable and then we
05:09 - are going to install web server so just
05:12 - click this Microsoft uh website link and
05:15 - in here you can uh see we are going to
05:17 - install visual C++ redistributable for
05:22 - visual studio 2012 update 4 okay select
05:25 - your language and uh click download and
05:28 - in here we we are going to uh check this
05:31 - first option which is for 64bit
05:34 - operating system if you have uh 32-bit
05:37 - operating system you can choose the
05:39 - second option or if you have ARM device
05:42 - you can choose the third option so in
05:44 - our case we are going to choose the
05:46 - first option then click
05:52 - next and now the executable will be
05:57 - downloaded you can see our executable is
06:00 - downloaded so just click this executable
06:02 - file
06:04 - here and then click
06:10 - run and then just check this check box
06:14 - to agree with license terms and
06:16 - condition and click
06:18 - install and click
06:20 - yes and once visual C++ distributable uh
06:24 - installation is complete you can just uh
06:27 - close it and once again you can open
06:29 - your favorite web browser and then
06:32 - search for we server and then go to the
06:37 - same website web server.com and then
06:40 - once again go to downloads here and then
06:43 - once again click the web server option
06:46 - and then this time you need to uh just
06:48 - click download directly okay so it's
06:52 - going to download this web server
06:56 - executable
06:57 - right so we will wait for this web
07:01 - server executable to download it's not a
07:04 - big file it's just
07:07 - 41.5 MB file so it's going to download
07:11 - uh in few seconds now once the download
07:15 - is complete you can click this
07:17 - executable file for the WM server and
07:20 - you will be able to see this kind of uh
07:23 - we server setup so just click next and
07:26 - in here just click I accept the
07:28 - agreement and click next next and this
07:30 - is the location where web server will be
07:33 - installed so
07:35 - c/w will be the folder in which this web
07:39 - server will be installed so just click
07:40 - next and then you can create a desktop
07:44 - icon and quick launch icon also so I'm
07:48 - going to create only desktop icon for
07:50 - that and click next and click
07:56 - install now in here it's going to tell
07:59 - you or ask you please choose your
08:01 - default web browser and if you're not
08:04 - sure just click open or if you have some
08:08 - uh browser preferences you can choose
08:10 - your browser from here for example I
08:12 - want to choose a Chrome web browser so
08:15 - I'm going to go to my C folder and in
08:17 - here I'm going to go to program files
08:20 - x86 and in here go to Google folder and
08:25 - go to Chrome application and choose
08:28 - chrome. EX see and click open okay and
08:32 - then it's going to finish installing and
08:36 - you can see the we server icon here okay
08:40 - and right now you just need to uh allow
08:44 - the access so just click allow access
08:49 - here and these are the PHP mail
08:53 - parameter which we are not going to use
08:56 - right now so we will leave them as
08:58 - default and click click next and then
09:01 - just click finish and please make sure
09:04 - that this option is checked to launch
09:06 - the web server right so just click
09:09 - finish and click yes and it's going to
09:13 - launch your we server and when your web
09:18 - server is uh ready it's going to show
09:22 - you this green web server icon here
09:26 - right so you can just click this web
09:28 - server icon here
09:30 - and you can see all these options here
09:34 - okay so right now you can uh see PHP my
09:37 - admin Apache MySQL folder and other
09:42 - options for web server so first of all
09:45 - what we are going to do is we are going
09:47 - to use PHP my admin to create our
09:52 - database so let's create a database now
09:56 - you can see our PHP my admin is open
09:59 - open here and by default it has uh some
10:03 - uh databases right so to create a
10:06 - database what we can do here is we can
10:09 - click database and give the database
10:12 - name so for example we are creating a
10:14 - database for employees so we can just
10:17 - write employee 101 and then just click
10:21 - create here and you can see our database
10:24 - is created so expand your database right
10:26 - now uh we don't have any uh table inside
10:30 - the database so just click this uh
10:33 - employee database and in create table
10:36 - option you can just create the table
10:39 - inside your database so for example we
10:42 - are going to create a table called
10:43 - employee data and uh then we are going
10:47 - to provide the number of column it's
10:49 - going to contain so for example it's
10:52 - going to contain uh employee ID name
10:56 - surname age and username and password so
10:59 - it's going to contain six uh columns
11:02 - just select six from here and then click
11:06 - go and then it's going to give you this
11:09 - kind of wizard first is our ID second is
11:13 - the name third is the surname fourth
11:17 - column is the age fifth column is the
11:20 - username and sixth column is the
11:22 - password okay now ID is integer name is
11:27 - text
11:29 - surname data type is text also age data
11:32 - type is int itself username data type is
11:36 - text and password data type is text okay
11:41 - now uh we can also uh choose the primary
11:46 - key of uh this table so ID is our
11:49 - primary key so go to index here and then
11:52 - choose uh primary for ID okay and uh
11:56 - this ID is also going to be Auto
11:59 - incremented so choose this option which
12:01 - says aore I which is auto increment okay
12:07 - and then once this is done we can just
12:10 - save our table okay so now our table
12:15 - contains six columns which you can just
12:19 - click on this uh employee table and then
12:23 - you can see all the columns inside the
12:26 - table which is ID name surname age and
12:29 - username and password columns right so
12:33 - our database and database table is ready
12:38 - to use now after creating our database
12:42 - we need to write some uh PHP script to
12:46 - connect to the database and then fetch
12:50 - the data or insert the data using this
12:54 - PHP script so now what we need to do is
12:57 - once again click this web server icon
13:00 - here and this time click this www
13:04 - directory option here okay so just click
13:07 - this option dub dubdub directory which
13:10 - is going to open this VM server SL
13:14 - dubdub duub directory and in here you
13:17 - can see by default
13:19 - index.php and test MySQL PHP here okay
13:25 - so what we can do here is we can create
13:28 - one more more file you can just create a
13:31 - new uh file from here it can be a PHP
13:36 - file okay or you can open uh
13:40 - notepad++ and in here you can create a
13:44 - PHP file so just open a new tab and then
13:48 - save it as a PHP file so first is the
13:55 - connection PHP file okay so I'm going to
13:59 - just uh choose the same folder from uh C
14:04 - so
14:06 - cwm and then in the wamp we are going to
14:10 - go to
14:11 - www and in here we are going to create a
14:14 - PHP file which is connection PHP so I'm
14:18 - just going to write con. PHP okay and
14:23 - then click
14:25 - save and it's going to create this uh
14:28 - file file which is con. PHP here okay so
14:33 - now we can write some PHP script to
14:37 - connect to the database so how we can
14:40 - write it first of all you just need to
14:43 - uh write this PHP initialization element
14:48 - and in between this uh PHP element we
14:50 - are going to Define some variables and
14:53 - to Define a variable in PHP you need a
14:56 - dollar symbol and then the variable
14:59 - varable name so for example first is our
15:02 - database
15:03 - name and which is going to be equal to
15:07 - we going to Define these names in a
15:10 - while just uh give a double quotation
15:13 - symbol right now okay second is the
15:18 - MySQL username so just write
15:25 - MySQL underscore
15:29 - username okay is equal to leave it blank
15:33 - for now and then third option is the
15:38 - MySQL password okay so just write MySQL
15:43 - for
15:44 - example password okay and the fourth
15:47 - option is the server name right
15:52 - so the fourth option is
15:56 - the server underscore name okay so now
16:01 - first option is database name so
16:04 - database which we have created is this
16:07 - database which is employee 101 right so
16:11 - just uh copy the name of the database
16:15 - and go to your uh PHP file and give the
16:18 - name of your database right the second
16:21 - option is the MySQL username so we can
16:26 - see the MySQL username by going to
16:30 - the database so just select the database
16:33 - and then see the Privileges and in here
16:36 - you can see the username is root and uh
16:40 - the privilege is all
16:44 - right so for the username we are going
16:47 - to choose root from here and we are
16:51 - going to just paste here because our
16:53 - username is root and the password what
16:57 - is the password so for for example we
16:59 - are going to use this Local Host as a
17:02 - server name so we are going to just
17:04 - write Local Host and in here we can just
17:09 - go to edit Privileges and go down a
17:12 - little and right now there is no
17:14 - password or you can just select this
17:16 - option which is no password and then
17:19 - click go and it's going to uh you know
17:23 - save your changes successfully so our
17:26 - password is nothing or blank okay now
17:31 - after that to connect to a database we
17:33 - are going to create a variable called
17:35 - con and we are going to initiate it with
17:41 - uh method called
17:43 - MySQL I connect so just write
17:48 - mysqli
17:50 - underscore
17:53 - connect and then inside the brackets
17:56 - just pass the four uh arguments it takes
18:02 - uh four argument first is your server
18:05 - name so just pass the first argument as
18:08 - server name second is the MySQL username
18:13 - so second is this one third is MySQL
18:17 - password so just copy this variable and
18:20 - paste it here and the fourth is the
18:24 - database name so database name is this
18:27 - one okay so these are the four arguments
18:31 - right now to check if the connection is
18:33 - successful or not you can uh just give
18:36 - this condition if and inside the if
18:39 - statement you can just write this
18:42 - variable con which gives you the Boolean
18:47 - uh result and then inside these brackets
18:51 - if the connection is successful you can
18:53 - Echo something so you can just write
18:56 - Echo connection success otherwise in the
19:00 - else condition just write else here and
19:03 - then in the else condition you can Echo
19:07 - connection not success okay so just
19:10 - write Echo
19:13 - connection not success okay and then
19:17 - save everything and then open your uh
19:21 - web browser and in here you just need to
19:24 - first of all write Local Host which is
19:27 - going to give you this kind of of web
19:29 - server options like this right and then
19:32 - whenever you give Local Host slash con.
19:37 - PHP which is our file name if you
19:41 - remember inside our www folder we have
19:44 - this uh con. PHP file so in your browser
19:50 - you just need to write Local Host and
19:52 - then SL con. PHP right and when you
19:57 - click enter
19:59 - it's going to give you connection
20:01 - success if your connection is successful
20:04 - otherwise it's going to give you
20:06 - connection not success so let's edit our
20:11 - you know uh these values so we can uh
20:14 - know that it gives the right result so I
20:17 - will change the database name to a wrong
20:20 - database name and save it and once again
20:24 - refresh this uh localhost SLC con. PHP
20:29 - and now it's going to give you this
20:32 - error report right and it says
20:34 - connection not success so we know that
20:38 - whenever we write the right parameters
20:43 - it's going to give us the connection
20:45 - success right so right parameter gives
20:47 - the connection success okay so in this
20:50 - way we know that our PHP is able to
20:53 - connect to the mySQL database right now
20:58 - we are going to create one more PHP
21:00 - script so I'm going to just write create
21:04 - a new PHP script and I'm going to save
21:07 - it as for example login.php so just
21:11 - write
21:12 - login.php and click save here and once
21:17 - again I'm going to just give the PHP
21:21 - initialization Tech and in here first of
21:24 - all we are going to uh you know import
21:28 - this Cod con. PHP which gives us the
21:31 - connection right so we are going to
21:35 - require first of all so just
21:38 - write require and then inside the double
21:42 - code con. PHP con. PHP right so this is
21:48 - going to import this connection and then
21:52 - we are going to create two variables one
21:55 - is uh user uncore name which we are
22:00 - going to give in a while and right now
22:03 - we are going to leave it as uh blank and
22:07 - second variable name is the user
22:10 - password so just write
22:12 - user pass and leave it as blank for now
22:17 - because we are going to uh you know
22:19 - enter some data inside the table and
22:23 - then we are going to check against it
22:25 - okay and then we are going to prepare
22:28 - our uh query so just write uh
22:32 - MySQL for example query okay query for
22:36 - QR Y and in here we want to check if the
22:41 - username and password is correct so we
22:43 - can just
22:44 - write
22:46 - select some uh element or you can just
22:49 - write select ASX which is a wild card
22:52 - for selecting everything from your
22:56 - database name so our database table name
22:59 - is employee data if you remember this
23:03 - one is our database table name so just
23:06 - copy the same name and paste it here and
23:10 - then just
23:12 - write where clause and in here we are
23:17 - going to check username and password
23:20 - right so we want to check the column
23:23 - name username and password right so
23:27 - where user
23:29 - name
23:31 - like your uh username variable so in the
23:35 - single codes you just need to copy this
23:39 - variable and paste it here and uh then
23:44 - just give a space here and in here after
23:48 - that just write end and
23:51 - then take your password column name
23:55 - which is this one and paste it here here
23:59 - and then once again single code and
24:02 - inside the single code you just need to
24:04 - give your uh user pass variable name
24:09 - which is this one right so I'm going to
24:11 - just minimize this a little and just
24:15 - paste it here
24:18 - okay and don't forget to give this
24:22 - semicolon before this uh double quotes
24:26 - and after this double quote also now we
24:29 - are going to execute this query so we
24:32 - want to create a variable called for
24:37 - example result is equal to and then we
24:42 - need to call a method called my
24:45 - SQL
24:47 - underscore query so just write my SQL
24:51 - query and as an argument we need two uh
24:56 - you know parameters one is is the
24:59 - connection variable which we have here
25:02 - in connection.php which is this
25:05 - one and the second argument is our query
25:09 - which is this one right and then we can
25:13 - evaluate our result using uh if
25:16 - condition so just write if our query
25:20 - provide more than one line of result
25:23 - then we know that username and password
25:25 - is correct so just write my S qli I
25:31 - underscore num underscore rows and then
25:36 - inside these bracket just pass this
25:39 - result variable so just
25:42 - pass
25:44 - result and we will evaluate if it's uh
25:48 - greater than zero then we will say that
25:53 - our username and password is correct
25:57 - right so in the Echo we can just
26:03 - Echo loging success right so just
26:07 - write
26:09 - login
26:11 - success okay and otherwise if there is
26:14 - no result we are going to Echo that
26:17 - login is not successful so just copy
26:21 - this same and just say login not success
26:25 - okay and save your code
26:28 - now in your database you don't have any
26:31 - uh data so these two variables we have
26:35 - left right now blank but let's insert
26:38 - some data inside our database so just uh
26:42 - you know select your uh employee data
26:45 - table and select this option which says
26:50 - insert here so just select this and in
26:53 - here we are going to insert some uh data
26:56 - so for example employ Loy ID one name is
27:01 - uh Tom and the surname is for example
27:06 - something and the age is
27:09 - 22
27:13 - and and username is 1 two3 and password
27:17 - is 1 two3 okay and just click go it's
27:21 - going to insert this username and
27:23 - password so go to browse once again and
27:26 - now you can see uh this data is added to
27:30 - your table employee id1 Tom Ben age is
27:33 - 22 and username and password is one 2 3
27:36 - and 1 two 3 so when we write here 1 two
27:40 - 3 1 two 3 and password is also 1 two 3
27:44 - and save it and in here I think this
27:47 - should be mysqli I query so instead of
27:51 - MySQL Query you need to write MySQL iore
27:55 - Query right and save your uh PHP file go

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the first video on Android mySQL database tutorial for beginners in this video series we are going to learn how we can create an Android app using mySQL database which is running on some web server so let's see what are the requirement first of all we are going to uh need uh mySQL database and then we want to use a web server web server can be an Apache web server or or engine next web server or any other web server we can also use a web server which is running on web hosting right now we are also going to need a server side scripting language in our case we are going to use PHP for serers side scripting so this serers side scripting language will help us to query the database and cater the result and the last we are going to need uh Android development environment which we are already using which is Android studio now there are different ways of uh getting these databases and web server and scripting language together so for testing purposes what we can do is we can uh download and install a WM server and what is a WM server wamp server is a Windows web development environment and it allows you to create a web application with Apache PHP and mySQL database alongside it's also going to give you PHP my admin which allows you to manage your uh database easily okay so this is the first option which we can use for creating our first Android application for and for testing our application now for practical uses we can use web hosting and a server which is running on some web hosting website like uh GoDaddy or HostGator or Google hosting or any other hosting website okay so what is uh web hosting web hosting is a service which uh you can use to you know host your website site and it generally comes with uh you know uh file system and database integrated so we can use uh this web hosting also so I'm going to uh give you uh both examples using uh web web server also and this web hosting also so you can uh create online uh you know mySQL database using Android application right so first of all we are going to create an application using VM server it comes with mySQL Apache and PHP my admin so let's uh download and install WM web server and then we are going to write some PHP scripts to query our database and then we are going to create our Android application so first of all open your favorite browser and search for WM server and the first result most probably which will appear here will be from webs server.com slen for English just click this link here and this is the website from which you can install WM web server so you can read more about web server in here and how you can install it so to download web server executable file you just need to click download uh section here and in here you have two options one is web server for 32bit operating system and second uh is the web server for 64 bit operating system I have 64bit operating system so I'm going to click this uh option right now in here you can uh read the prerequisite for installing the we server so you can read here don't don't use previous web server extension or addons so you must not have any other or previous version of web server when you are installing it right the second warning here it says that this web server requires Visual Studio 2012 vc11 executable file so to install this web server you need to have Visual Studio 2012 vc1 and to download and install it you can just click this link so first of all I'm going to click this uh link to install uh this executable and then we are going to install web server so just click this Microsoft uh website link and in here you can uh see we are going to install visual C++ redistributable for visual studio 2012 update 4 okay select your language and uh click download and in here we we are going to uh check this first option which is for 64bit operating system if you have uh 32bit operating system you can choose the second option or if you have ARM device you can choose the third option so in our case we are going to choose the first option then click next and now the executable will be downloaded you can see our executable is downloaded so just click this executable file here and then click run and then just check this check box to agree with license terms and condition and click install and click yes and once visual C++ distributable uh installation is complete you can just uh close it and once again you can open your favorite web browser and then search for we server and then go to the same website web server.com and then once again go to downloads here and then once again click the web server option and then this time you need to uh just click download directly okay so it's going to download this web server executable right so we will wait for this web server executable to download it's not a big file it's just 41.5 MB file so it's going to download uh in few seconds now once the download is complete you can click this executable file for the WM server and you will be able to see this kind of uh we server setup so just click next and in here just click I accept the agreement and click next next and this is the location where web server will be installed so c/w will be the folder in which this web server will be installed so just click next and then you can create a desktop icon and quick launch icon also so I'm going to create only desktop icon for that and click next and click install now in here it's going to tell you or ask you please choose your default web browser and if you're not sure just click open or if you have some uh browser preferences you can choose your browser from here for example I want to choose a Chrome web browser so I'm going to go to my C folder and in here I'm going to go to program files x86 and in here go to Google folder and go to Chrome application and choose chrome. EX see and click open okay and then it's going to finish installing and you can see the we server icon here okay and right now you just need to uh allow the access so just click allow access here and these are the PHP mail parameter which we are not going to use right now so we will leave them as default and click click next and then just click finish and please make sure that this option is checked to launch the web server right so just click finish and click yes and it's going to launch your we server and when your web server is uh ready it's going to show you this green web server icon here right so you can just click this web server icon here and you can see all these options here okay so right now you can uh see PHP my admin Apache MySQL folder and other options for web server so first of all what we are going to do is we are going to use PHP my admin to create our database so let's create a database now you can see our PHP my admin is open open here and by default it has uh some uh databases right so to create a database what we can do here is we can click database and give the database name so for example we are creating a database for employees so we can just write employee 101 and then just click create here and you can see our database is created so expand your database right now uh we don't have any uh table inside the database so just click this uh employee database and in create table option you can just create the table inside your database so for example we are going to create a table called employee data and uh then we are going to provide the number of column it's going to contain so for example it's going to contain uh employee ID name surname age and username and password so it's going to contain six uh columns just select six from here and then click go and then it's going to give you this kind of wizard first is our ID second is the name third is the surname fourth column is the age fifth column is the username and sixth column is the password okay now ID is integer name is text surname data type is text also age data type is int itself username data type is text and password data type is text okay now uh we can also uh choose the primary key of uh this table so ID is our primary key so go to index here and then choose uh primary for ID okay and uh this ID is also going to be Auto incremented so choose this option which says aore I which is auto increment okay and then once this is done we can just save our table okay so now our table contains six columns which you can just click on this uh employee table and then you can see all the columns inside the table which is ID name surname age and username and password columns right so our database and database table is ready to use now after creating our database we need to write some uh PHP script to connect to the database and then fetch the data or insert the data using this PHP script so now what we need to do is once again click this web server icon here and this time click this www directory option here okay so just click this option dub dubdub directory which is going to open this VM server SL dubdub duub directory and in here you can see by default index.php and test MySQL PHP here okay so what we can do here is we can create one more more file you can just create a new uh file from here it can be a PHP file okay or you can open uh notepad++ and in here you can create a PHP file so just open a new tab and then save it as a PHP file so first is the connection PHP file okay so I'm going to just uh choose the same folder from uh C so cwm and then in the wamp we are going to go to www and in here we are going to create a PHP file which is connection PHP so I'm just going to write con. PHP okay and then click save and it's going to create this uh file file which is con. PHP here okay so now we can write some PHP script to connect to the database so how we can write it first of all you just need to uh write this PHP initialization element and in between this uh PHP element we are going to Define some variables and to Define a variable in PHP you need a dollar symbol and then the variable varable name so for example first is our database name and which is going to be equal to we going to Define these names in a while just uh give a double quotation symbol right now okay second is the MySQL username so just write MySQL underscore username okay is equal to leave it blank for now and then third option is the MySQL password okay so just write MySQL for example password okay and the fourth option is the server name right so the fourth option is the server underscore name okay so now first option is database name so database which we have created is this database which is employee 101 right so just uh copy the name of the database and go to your uh PHP file and give the name of your database right the second option is the MySQL username so we can see the MySQL username by going to the database so just select the database and then see the Privileges and in here you can see the username is root and uh the privilege is all right so for the username we are going to choose root from here and we are going to just paste here because our username is root and the password what is the password so for for example we are going to use this Local Host as a server name so we are going to just write Local Host and in here we can just go to edit Privileges and go down a little and right now there is no password or you can just select this option which is no password and then click go and it's going to uh you know save your changes successfully so our password is nothing or blank okay now after that to connect to a database we are going to create a variable called con and we are going to initiate it with uh method called MySQL I connect so just write mysqli underscore connect and then inside the brackets just pass the four uh arguments it takes uh four argument first is your server name so just pass the first argument as server name second is the MySQL username so second is this one third is MySQL password so just copy this variable and paste it here and the fourth is the database name so database name is this one okay so these are the four arguments right now to check if the connection is successful or not you can uh just give this condition if and inside the if statement you can just write this variable con which gives you the Boolean uh result and then inside these brackets if the connection is successful you can Echo something so you can just write Echo connection success otherwise in the else condition just write else here and then in the else condition you can Echo connection not success okay so just write Echo connection not success okay and then save everything and then open your uh web browser and in here you just need to first of all write Local Host which is going to give you this kind of of web server options like this right and then whenever you give Local Host slash con. PHP which is our file name if you remember inside our www folder we have this uh con. PHP file so in your browser you just need to write Local Host and then SL con. PHP right and when you click enter it's going to give you connection success if your connection is successful otherwise it's going to give you connection not success so let's edit our you know uh these values so we can uh know that it gives the right result so I will change the database name to a wrong database name and save it and once again refresh this uh localhost SLC con. PHP and now it's going to give you this error report right and it says connection not success so we know that whenever we write the right parameters it's going to give us the connection success right so right parameter gives the connection success okay so in this way we know that our PHP is able to connect to the mySQL database right now we are going to create one more PHP script so I'm going to just write create a new PHP script and I'm going to save it as for example login.php so just write login.php and click save here and once again I'm going to just give the PHP initialization Tech and in here first of all we are going to uh you know import this Cod con. PHP which gives us the connection right so we are going to require first of all so just write require and then inside the double code con. PHP con. PHP right so this is going to import this connection and then we are going to create two variables one is uh user uncore name which we are going to give in a while and right now we are going to leave it as uh blank and second variable name is the user password so just write user pass and leave it as blank for now because we are going to uh you know enter some data inside the table and then we are going to check against it okay and then we are going to prepare our uh query so just write uh MySQL for example query okay query for QR Y and in here we want to check if the username and password is correct so we can just write select some uh element or you can just write select ASX which is a wild card for selecting everything from your database name so our database table name is employee data if you remember this one is our database table name so just copy the same name and paste it here and then just write where clause and in here we are going to check username and password right so we want to check the column name username and password right so where user name like your uh username variable so in the single codes you just need to copy this variable and paste it here and uh then just give a space here and in here after that just write end and then take your password column name which is this one and paste it here here and then once again single code and inside the single code you just need to give your uh user pass variable name which is this one right so I'm going to just minimize this a little and just paste it here okay and don't forget to give this semicolon before this uh double quotes and after this double quote also now we are going to execute this query so we want to create a variable called for example result is equal to and then we need to call a method called my SQL underscore query so just write my SQL query and as an argument we need two uh you know parameters one is is the connection variable which we have here in connection.php which is this one and the second argument is our query which is this one right and then we can evaluate our result using uh if condition so just write if our query provide more than one line of result then we know that username and password is correct so just write my S qli I underscore num underscore rows and then inside these bracket just pass this result variable so just pass result and we will evaluate if it's uh greater than zero then we will say that our username and password is correct right so in the Echo we can just Echo loging success right so just write login success okay and otherwise if there is no result we are going to Echo that login is not successful so just copy this same and just say login not success okay and save your code now in your database you don't have any uh data so these two variables we have left right now blank but let's insert some data inside our database so just uh you know select your uh employee data table and select this option which says insert here so just select this and in here we are going to insert some uh data so for example employ Loy ID one name is uh Tom and the surname is for example something and the age is 22 and and username is 1 two3 and password is 1 two3 okay and just click go it's going to insert this username and password so go to browse once again and now you can see uh this data is added to your table employee id1 Tom Ben age is 22 and username and password is one 2 3 and 1 two 3 so when we write here 1 two 3 1 two 3 and password is also 1 two 3 and save it and in here I think this should be mysqli I query so instead of MySQL Query you need to write MySQL iore Query right and save your uh PHP file go to your uh web browser and just write Local Host and then this time you just need to light login.php and now it's going to give you connection success and login success that means your login is Success using the PHP script so right now we are done installing our web web server and we are done writing our PHP SC scripts so in the next video what we are going to do is we are going to create our Android app and we are going to connect it to our mySQL database using this PHP script so stay tuned and please RIT com And subscribe and bye for now
