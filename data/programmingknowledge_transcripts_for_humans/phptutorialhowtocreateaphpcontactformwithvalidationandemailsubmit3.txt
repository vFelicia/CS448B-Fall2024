00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - programming knowledge and this is the
00:03 - last video on how to create a contact
00:06 - form using PHP bootstrap and jQuery so
00:11 - in the last tutorial we have added the
00:13 - contact page profile or modified the
00:16 - contact that PHP file to actually send
00:20 - and process our message or recipient
00:24 - subject and all the fields necessary for
00:28 - our contact form so in this tutorial we
00:31 - will be working on with this index dot
00:34 - PHP and we will be adding all the Java
00:38 - scripts needed to process the sending of
00:42 - email so if you try to go to the end of
00:47 - this file we will see the script which
00:50 - is contact that yes we need to add this
00:54 - contact JS file to our project so we'll
00:57 - just go ahead and create the contact
01:00 - that is fine okay
01:04 - then saying for now so on a contact that
01:08 - GS so in here we'll just need to add the
01:19 - function or 10 function of jQuery or
01:22 - document unload and we'll just select
01:30 - the contact form and we just need to
01:36 - validate it start on validate or and we
01:44 - will also add a submit function for our
01:50 - contact form so this will be that time
01:52 - and it said May in the function e
02:06 - then let's just close this for now next
02:13 - is we need to check if the validator
02:18 - validated this sent prevent form submit
02:27 - so that's F II that prevent or is
02:35 - default default prevented then open
02:43 - curly braces or open in closed curly
02:46 - braces and we need to specify our URL
02:51 - which has contact that HP that we have
02:55 - defined in the previous video at that HP
03:00 - tablet PHP and here we will post values
03:07 - to the URL so let's just use the Ajax
03:11 - request with all the parameters that
03:17 - needs or that needs to set so that is
03:22 - post the type of this request exposed
03:27 - and the URL will will be deep around a
03:30 - rectifying top and the data will be
03:34 - coming from our former force this and
03:40 - let's just serialize form and if the
03:46 - request is successful let's just define
03:50 - a new function the London it so there
03:54 - will be data in a partly open and closed
03:58 - curly braces so as we all know that the
04:03 - data is the case and object that we
04:07 - receive we received from contact at page
04:14 - so we'll just build the research on
04:20 - earth earth and we need to build a
04:27 - message alert here message alert and
04:33 - this will be depending on the response
04:37 - coming from both docked at HP so this
04:41 - will be the data type and we need to set
04:46 - also the texts some message tanks that
04:51 - will be also coming from our contact at
04:54 - HP so data message and below this we
05:00 - need to set the alert box for our
05:03 - feedback so we need to define a div with
05:09 - class alert okay so I think we need to
05:17 - interchange this instead after the code
05:20 - we need to use a single code and this
05:24 - will be the also and we need to are the
05:35 - type coming from our index or any
05:39 - quantum dot PHP so that will be the
05:42 - message alert and also we need to add
05:50 - another class for this which is alert -
05:52 - this visible then we need to add a
05:58 - bottle to this so let's button or
06:05 - sequencing button tag and inside this
06:12 - opening time we need to specify the type
06:15 - which is a type button in as
06:22 - clothes and data this mess it was dirt
06:28 - and area hidden it was true and we need
06:41 - to specify also the icon or the display
06:46 - or our clothes bottle which is the times
06:50 - okay we'll just close the div element or
06:59 - our message alerts out there and we need
07:05 - to specify the message that's okay and
07:14 - close this line with the same column so
07:17 - right below this line we need to check
07:22 - if we have message alert and we have the
07:31 - message tax so if we have those two we
07:38 - need to reject be lured into the
07:45 - messages that message is still just a
07:52 - tip that we want to or where we want to
07:57 - display the message of our contact form
08:00 - so platform time as much as relative
08:14 - with the class messages and we're just
08:16 - going to set the HTML into our alert box
08:23 - and also the contact or will be or we
08:31 - will need to present our
08:34 - contact form so let's reset and open
08:41 - close parenthesis and semicolon after
08:44 - this line after the line for our Ajax so
08:48 - you just need to return pause so the
08:54 - next step is to test the project we need
09:00 - to test our project locally first and
09:02 - then we will upload this into into the
09:04 - server later on so let's go ahead and
09:07 - open up this project from our browser so
09:12 - here we are at our browser and we'll try
09:15 - we'll try to check our contact form its
09:18 - if it's working or not because I'll be
09:21 - amazed and we if you don't have errors
09:24 - in our code so first we're going to
09:29 - check if we have errors in organs also
09:32 - click on this hamburger icon and web
09:35 - developer and click on this web console
09:40 - so as you can see we don't have errors
09:44 - for this page okay so it's a good thing
09:48 - now we need to test the form itself so
09:55 - let's just type in some values here and
10:01 - John Doe at gmail.com specify a request
10:06 - for excitation this is or testing
10:09 - purposes only and then click on the send
10:15 - message so we have an error in or
10:20 - contact that PHP file on line 28 so
10:24 - we'll try to fix this
10:27 - so looking our code contact at PHP in
10:31 - line 28 we have this so instead of
10:35 - having the semicolon we just need to
10:38 - delete this one and save our file and go
10:43 - back to our browser we just need to save
10:46 - this contact that is also
10:51 - so we need to refresh our page and send
11:01 - a message okay so we have failed to
11:10 - connect to a mail server at localhost
11:13 - port for the port 25
11:16 - verify your SMTP and so on so basically
11:20 - this means that our contact at PHP file
11:24 - is working but we don't have a working
11:27 - meal or SMTP setup in our local host so
11:32 - we need to upload this to our server so
11:37 - before uploading I did some tests and
11:39 - definitely we have several keywords that
11:42 - we have mistyped so so for example in
11:45 - our contact at PHP so instead of STR - L
11:49 - o L wer so this should be steer to
11:54 - lowercase the lower and we need to add
11:58 - also an else block here response write
12:04 - and pass in the message then close and
12:10 - also in our index dot PHP I think we
12:13 - have an error here so in your form or
12:16 - opening form tag we have added the
12:20 - caption to contact at PHP so instead of
12:24 - doing this here we need to remove this
12:27 - because we're doing all the submission
12:29 - by the jQuery file or the JavaScript
12:33 - file so save this one and also in our
12:37 - contact that Jas we this type here is
12:42 - default prevent so it should be is
12:44 - default prevented change that one and
12:47 - save so it is now time to upload our
12:53 - project online so you could choose
12:56 - whatever FTP client
12:58 - you're gonna use so for me I use the FTP
13:01 - or the FileZilla FTP client so this is
13:06 - the lab version of our contact form and
13:09 - we're just going to test and send a test
13:12 - message so we just need to fill out this
13:15 - form so first name will be John the last
13:19 - name is no the email is John Doe at
13:23 - gmail.com and we just need to specify
13:25 - what our specific needs are so let's say
13:28 - for example request petition and for our
13:34 - message let's just say this is an email
13:38 - from the awesome on top form created by
13:45 - from college and then click on the send
13:51 - message okay so we have here the
13:56 - nice-looking alert contact form
13:59 - successfully submitted I will get back
14:00 - to you so we'll check the email if we
14:03 - got the email from this form so we have
14:07 - here the test email that we have sent
14:11 - from our contact form if you can't find
14:14 - the email in your inbox you can check
14:17 - your spam folder because sometimes our
14:20 - most of the time if you have
14:22 - unrecognized domain it will always end
14:26 - up in the spam folder so I think that's
14:30 - it for this tutorial
14:31 - Thanks
