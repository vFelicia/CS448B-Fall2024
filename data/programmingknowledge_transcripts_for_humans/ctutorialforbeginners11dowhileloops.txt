00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I've have shown you how to
00:03 - use while Loops in C++ now in this video
00:07 - I'm going to show you how to use do
00:09 - while loop in
00:11 - C++ so what is the basic difference
00:14 - between while loop and do while loop the
00:18 - basic difference between do while loop
00:20 - and while loop is while loop if the
00:24 - condition is false and if the condition
00:26 - is not met it will not execute but the
00:30 - do while loop it will execute at least
00:33 - once even if the condition is not true
00:36 - so let me show you the
00:39 - demonstration this is the code I have
00:41 - written in the last video this is simple
00:43 - code in which I have X is equal to 1
00:47 - number is equal to0 and sum is equal to
00:50 - Z I have initialized three variables and
00:53 - in the Y Loop I'm checking whether the
00:56 - value of x is less than or equal to 5
00:59 - and if it it's less than or equal to
01:01 - five I ask the user to enter some number
01:05 - and I make the sum of these number and
01:09 - once the condition is fulfilled and the
01:11 - user has entered the value five times in
01:15 - the while loop then I have print the sum
01:18 - so if you don't remember just see the
01:21 - last video it's very simple so let's say
01:26 - I want to convert this into the do while
01:29 - loop
01:30 - so for example let's take an example of
01:33 - while do first so what this is doing is
01:38 - when the condition is true it's printing
01:40 - the message but if condition is not true
01:44 - for example X is less than one which is
01:47 - not true X is equal to one so which is
01:49 - not less than one this will
01:53 - not executed this code will not be
01:56 - executed and the sum will remain zero
01:59 - because we have initialize the sum as
02:01 - zero so let's build it
02:05 - and run the program and you see the sum
02:08 - is zero and this is
02:10 - never executed right now for example if
02:15 - we write the same code with do while
02:16 - loop what is
02:19 - the syntax of do while loop is just cut
02:22 - this while
02:24 - loop from here and paste it after this
02:29 - curly Braes and just write do Above This
02:33 - is the syntax of two wi Loop and do not
02:36 - forget to give this semicolon here so
02:39 - this is the simple syntax of do while
02:42 - loop okay so
02:45 - now even if the condition is
02:48 - false our program is will be executed
02:53 - once because it says do this while this
02:58 - condition is met so it will be executed
03:00 - once and then it the program will check
03:03 - okay this condition is not met so once
03:06 - again it will not Loop or it will not
03:09 - execute the same so let's run the
03:13 - program once again or execute the
03:15 - program once again and run it and you
03:18 - see the program is executed input any
03:21 - value which is this so it goes inside
03:23 - the loop and I give any value 56 and
03:26 - press enter and it gives me the sum
03:31 - 56 okay so it gives me the sum 56 right
03:36 - so that means the program is executed at
03:39 - least one even if the condition is not
03:43 - really true so this is the basic
03:45 - difference between do while loop so now
03:50 - the question you may ask is where we can
03:54 - use two while loop because um the
03:59 - condition is false false why do we want
04:01 - to execute this code right so I will
04:06 - give you a very good example of do while
04:09 - loop I think a year ago I have written a
04:13 - program using do while loop for the
04:16 - simple calculator so in my blog which is
04:20 - programming knowledge blog. blogsport.de
04:23 - I will um just post the link below this
04:27 - video you can go there and you can go to
04:30 - this C++ code example and the first
04:34 - example here write a C++ program to make
04:37 - a simple computer in here I have written
04:40 - a code using dowi Loop how to make a
04:43 - simple computer using dowi Loop okay so
04:46 - this is a very good example you can see
04:49 - why I have really used twoy Loops so I
04:52 - will what I will do is I will just copy
04:55 - this code from
04:56 - here and paste it I will select it all
05:00 - and paste it in my code blocks okay in
05:05 - here and I will just delete the system
05:09 - pause because in code blocks you don't
05:11 - need system pause at the bottom just
05:15 - above this written zero I have written
05:18 - system pause I can I will just comment
05:20 - it out and now I will build the
05:26 - program and program is built and now
05:28 - when I run this program you see it's a
05:31 - beautiful program
05:33 - to for the calculator it prints welcome
05:36 - to the calculator program version by
05:39 - your name and please enter the operation
05:42 - you want to execute so it can execute
05:45 - addition
05:47 - subtraction multiplication division and
05:52 - swapping okay for example I want to
05:54 - execute addition so I will give plus
05:57 - here and I will enter and then program
06:02 - ask me to enter the first number I will
06:05 - enter some random number here and
06:09 - program ask me to enter second number so
06:11 - I will once again enter other number and
06:14 - I will press enter and it gives me the
06:17 - answer so it says the addition of two
06:19 - number which I have entered is this and
06:22 - then the do while loop comes into
06:26 - action then it's ask me and ENT y or
06:30 - capital Y to continue okay so I will
06:34 - enter Y and when I press enter it
06:37 - doesn't go out of the loop but it will
06:40 - ask me once again what operation you
06:42 - want to perform so I will say
06:45 - multiplication this time and some number
06:49 - first number second number it will give
06:51 - the multiplication so it will execute
06:53 - the program and then it will ask whether
06:56 - you want to exit the program or not this
06:58 - time I will enter some
07:01 - random character which is not y or
07:03 - capital Y then my program is out of the
07:10 - loop so this is the very good example I
07:13 - have written here if you want you can
07:16 - check and you can see how I have used
07:20 - two while loop in order to make this
07:22 - simple calculator so I hope you have
07:25 - enjoyed this video please wrate comment
07:26 - and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I've have shown you how to use while Loops in C++ now in this video I'm going to show you how to use do while loop in C++ so what is the basic difference between while loop and do while loop the basic difference between do while loop and while loop is while loop if the condition is false and if the condition is not met it will not execute but the do while loop it will execute at least once even if the condition is not true so let me show you the demonstration this is the code I have written in the last video this is simple code in which I have X is equal to 1 number is equal to0 and sum is equal to Z I have initialized three variables and in the Y Loop I'm checking whether the value of x is less than or equal to 5 and if it it's less than or equal to five I ask the user to enter some number and I make the sum of these number and once the condition is fulfilled and the user has entered the value five times in the while loop then I have print the sum so if you don't remember just see the last video it's very simple so let's say I want to convert this into the do while loop so for example let's take an example of while do first so what this is doing is when the condition is true it's printing the message but if condition is not true for example X is less than one which is not true X is equal to one so which is not less than one this will not executed this code will not be executed and the sum will remain zero because we have initialize the sum as zero so let's build it and run the program and you see the sum is zero and this is never executed right now for example if we write the same code with do while loop what is the syntax of do while loop is just cut this while loop from here and paste it after this curly Braes and just write do Above This is the syntax of two wi Loop and do not forget to give this semicolon here so this is the simple syntax of do while loop okay so now even if the condition is false our program is will be executed once because it says do this while this condition is met so it will be executed once and then it the program will check okay this condition is not met so once again it will not Loop or it will not execute the same so let's run the program once again or execute the program once again and run it and you see the program is executed input any value which is this so it goes inside the loop and I give any value 56 and press enter and it gives me the sum 56 okay so it gives me the sum 56 right so that means the program is executed at least one even if the condition is not really true so this is the basic difference between do while loop so now the question you may ask is where we can use two while loop because um the condition is false false why do we want to execute this code right so I will give you a very good example of do while loop I think a year ago I have written a program using do while loop for the simple calculator so in my blog which is programming knowledge blog. blogsport.de I will um just post the link below this video you can go there and you can go to this C++ code example and the first example here write a C++ program to make a simple computer in here I have written a code using dowi Loop how to make a simple computer using dowi Loop okay so this is a very good example you can see why I have really used twoy Loops so I will what I will do is I will just copy this code from here and paste it I will select it all and paste it in my code blocks okay in here and I will just delete the system pause because in code blocks you don't need system pause at the bottom just above this written zero I have written system pause I can I will just comment it out and now I will build the program and program is built and now when I run this program you see it's a beautiful program to for the calculator it prints welcome to the calculator program version by your name and please enter the operation you want to execute so it can execute addition subtraction multiplication division and swapping okay for example I want to execute addition so I will give plus here and I will enter and then program ask me to enter the first number I will enter some random number here and program ask me to enter second number so I will once again enter other number and I will press enter and it gives me the answer so it says the addition of two number which I have entered is this and then the do while loop comes into action then it's ask me and ENT y or capital Y to continue okay so I will enter Y and when I press enter it doesn't go out of the loop but it will ask me once again what operation you want to perform so I will say multiplication this time and some number first number second number it will give the multiplication so it will execute the program and then it will ask whether you want to exit the program or not this time I will enter some random character which is not y or capital Y then my program is out of the loop so this is the very good example I have written here if you want you can check and you can see how I have used two while loop in order to make this simple calculator so I hope you have enjoyed this video
