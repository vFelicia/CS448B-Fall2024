05:09 - bin because we don't need uh this
05:12 - installer
05:13 - anymore and once that's moved to bin we
05:17 - can now open the MySQL server so MySQL

05:47 - to see the status of your myql server
05:51 - instance you can also stop your MySQL
05:54 - server from here and you can also
05:57 - uncheck this checkbox so by default when
06:00 - you start your MacBook your MySQL server
06:04 - is going to start automatically if you

06:18 - here is the configuration section so you

06:30 - base directory which is installed in
06:32 - user local MySQL you also have the data
06:35 - directory so this is where your data
06:38 - will be saved for your MySQL you have
06:40 - the plug-in directory key ring directory
06:43 - and other files right so if you want uh
06:47 - to view uh any of uh these
06:50 - configurations you can uh change those
06:54 - configuration also or view them also
06:56 - right now once everything is working
06:59 - fine we can uh minimize this window and
07:03 - now let's try to connect to our MySQL
07:05 - server using the command line so just
07:08 - click on this Spotlight here and then
07:12 - just type
07:13 - terminal and then open the terminal and
07:18 - just write this command there which is
07:21 - MySQL space hyphen u space root space
07:26 - hyphen p and then press enter and most
07:29 - probably it's going to give you this
07:31 - kind of error which says zsh command not
07:34 - found and this is because we haven't set
07:39 - the path of MySQL binary directory in
07:42 - our zshrc
07:45 - file so when you open a terminal you are
07:49 - in the home folder of your Mac operating
07:53 - system so when you do for example LS
07:58 - space High hyphen Al here it's going to
08:01 - list out all the files and folders in
08:04 - the home
08:05 - folder you will be able to see this kind
08:09 - of uh file there also which is called do
08:12 - zshrc if you don't see this file you can
08:17 - create this file by giving this command
08:20 - so let me clear the terminal and then
08:23 - you can create this file by using the
08:26 - touch command so just write touch do
08:30 - zshrc and when you press enter it's
08:33 - going to create this file so if you
08:35 - don't see zshrc in your home folder you
08:39 - need to create one once do zshrc file is
08:44 - created you need to open it you can open
08:47 - it using a utility called Nano you can
08:51 - also open it uh using the utility called
08:54 - text editor which is the graphical
08:56 - editor on MacBook so for that you can
08:59 - give this command which is op space.
09:02 - zshrc I'm going to press enter which is
09:05 - going to open this do zshrc
09:09 - file now here I already have few exports
09:13 - which are related to different other
09:15 - tools here I need to add the path of the
09:17 - MySQL also so what you need to do is you
09:20 - need to add this uh command in your
09:24 - zshrc so let me copy this command from
09:27 - here I'm going to put this command in
09:30 - the description of this video also this
09:32 - command is export space path is equal to
09:35 - Dollar in the curly bracket path then
09:38 - colon SL user SL lo/ MySQL
09:43 - /bin now in your case you might need to
09:47 - change this path a little depending on
09:50 - the path of the MySQL bin directory now
09:55 - to be sure where this bin directory is
09:58 - located you can click on the spotlight
10:01 - option and then just type for/ USR here
10:05 - and it's going to show you this uh
10:07 - output under folder so you need to open
10:10 - the user directory right so just click
10:13 - on user folder which is USR and let's
10:18 - open it in other View and here under use
10:22 - USR you will see this local folder so
10:25 - click on local here so here you will be
10:27 - able to see the MySQL folder so I'm
10:30 - going to select this uh option which is
10:34 - uh MySQL 8.2.0 in your case it can be
10:37 - different and then select bin folder
10:39 - here and then right click on this folder
10:42 - so if you don't see the option to copy
10:44 - the path name then first of all click on
10:48 - view on the finder and then show path
10:52 - bar okay so just click on show path bar
10:55 - here which is going to show you the path
10:57 - bar of the selected folder so here once
11:01 - again just right click on this bin
11:03 - folder which is shown in the path bar
11:06 - and then click on this option which just
11:09 - copy bin as path name I'm going to copy
11:12 - this path and instead of this path I'm
11:16 - going to replace the path with the path
11:20 - which I have copied which is this one
11:22 - once you are done just save this file so
11:25 - file and save and once this file is
11:28 - saved I'm going to to close this file
11:30 - and once this uh file is uh closed we
11:34 - need to reload the dot zshrc in the
11:36 - current terminal so for that you need to
11:39 - write Source space do
11:44 - zshrc which is going to reload your path
11:47 - in the dot zshrc once that's done we are
11:51 - going to once again give this command
11:53 - which is MySQL space hyphen u space root
11:57 - space hyphen p press enter and this time
12:00 - it's going to ask you for your MySQL
12:03 - password this is the password which you
12:05 - have set at the time of installation of
12:07 - MySQL so let me give that password and
12:10 - then press
12:11 - enter and now I'm into the MySQL client
12:16 - and I'm connected to my MySQL server
12:19 - using this MySQL client right so now I
12:24 - can uh give show databases command here
12:28 - and then end with semicolon and it says
12:31 - syntax error because I should use show
12:35 - databases not show database and it's
12:38 - going to show me all the databases now
12:41 - if I want to create a new database I can
12:43 - give this command which is create
12:46 - database and then your database name
12:49 - which is demo for example so when I
12:52 - press enter it's going to create a new
12:54 - database and then once again when I give
12:56 - show databases command it's going to
12:58 - show me me the new database also in this
13:01 - list so now everything is working fine
13:05 - using the MySQL client now let's also
13:08 - see how we can install MySQL workbench
13:11 - which is a graphical user interface
13:14 - client for MySQL server on our Mac
13:17 - operating system so for that you need to
13:20 - uh open your favorite browser and search

all the databases now if I want to create a new database I can give this command which is create database and then your database name which is demo for example so when I press enter it's going to create a new database and then once again when I give show databases command it's going to show me me the new database also in this list so now everything is working fine using the MySQL client now let's also see how we can install MySQL workbench which is a graphical user interface client for MySQL server on our Mac operating system so for that you need to uh open your favorite browser and search for MySQL here and then the first link which will appear here will be from myql.com so I'm going to click on this link and then click on downloads here scroll down a little and then click on MySQL Community down downloads which is going to show you the list of community downloads We want to download this one which is my SQL workbench so I'm going to click on this and then for your M1 or M2 MacBook uh you can use the first option which is arm if if you're using Intel based MacBook you can use the second option in my case I will choose the first option because I have M2 MacBook I'm going to click on download and then just click on no thanks just start my download which is going to start the download of the MySQL workbench it's around 122 megabyte once this DMG file is downloaded I'm going to click on this DMG file which is going to start the installation process let me minimize this browser here the process is really simple I just need to drag this MySQL workbench into the applications folder so let me just select this MySQL workbench uh logo press command key on the keyboard and then drag this my school workbench logo into the applications folder just hover over the applications folder and drop it on the application folder which is going to copy this my schill workbench into the applications folder you can see it's copying into the applications folder once that's finished we can close this uh window and then we can go to the Launchpad and we will be able to see this uh MySQL workbench logo here so I can click on this MySQL workbench and then I have the option to connect to my myql server so here you can see you can click on this local instance 3306 which is the default port for my SQL Server so I'm going to click on this uh option here and then it's going to ask me for my MySQL server password so I'm going to provide that password so this is the same password which I have used at the installation of MySQL server right I'm also going to check this checkbox which says save password in Keychain and then click on okay and then it says connection warning local instance uh this one at this point I'm going to click on continue anyway so now I'm connected to the MySQL server using MySQL workbench here I can uh just let's say give this command show datab bases and then semicolon and then to run it I can run it by clicking on this uh icon here and I can see that this demo database is also there which we have created after the installation of mysq server so now you are connected to the MySQL server using the MySQL workbench also here you can also see the status of your MySQL server client connections and other uh good things about your MySQL server so this is how you can also install MySQL workbench on your Mac operating system so this is how you can download and install MySQL on your Mac operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
