00:01 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you
00:03 - how you can download and install android
00:05 - studio on your ubuntu operating system
00:08 - so the prerequisite of installing
00:11 - android studio on
00:12 - your ubuntu operating system is you need
00:14 - to have java installed on your ubuntu
00:16 - operating system
00:17 - so if you don't have java please install
00:20 - java
00:20 - on your ubuntu operating system i have
00:23 - already installed java on my
00:25 - ubuntu operating system so let's check
00:27 - which version of java i have so i will
00:30 - just
00:30 - press ctrl alt t to open my terminal
00:34 - and once the terminal is open i'm going
00:36 - to just
00:37 - give this command which is java hyphen
00:40 - hyphen
00:41 - version and it's going to give me the
00:43 - version of java
00:44 - so if you don't see any response related
00:47 - to java version here
00:49 - then most probably java is not installed
00:51 - so i have already created a video about
00:54 - how to install java on ubuntu operating
00:56 - system
00:57 - so i will put the link in the
00:58 - description of this video so you can
01:00 - just watch that video and install
01:03 - java so once you have java installed on
01:06 - your ubuntu operating system
01:07 - just open your favorite browser and
01:09 - search for android studio download
01:12 - and here the top link would be from
01:15 - developer.android.com forward slash
01:17 - studio so i'm going to just click on
01:20 - this link
01:21 - we are going to just check which version
01:23 - of android studio
01:25 - is available for the download we are not
01:27 - going to download android studio from
01:29 - this website
01:30 - i just want to check which is the latest
01:32 - version and at the time of making this
01:34 - video
01:35 - you can see the latest version is 4.1.2
01:39 - so we are going to download this version
01:41 - of android studio on our ubuntu
01:43 - operating system
01:44 - so once again go to your terminal
01:48 - and let me clear the terminal and we are
01:50 - going to use a utility called
01:52 - snap to install android studio so
01:56 - snap is basically a package management
01:59 - system
02:00 - uh which will help you to download and
02:03 - manage
02:04 - your software's right so first of all we
02:07 - are going to
02:08 - find android studio on snap so just
02:11 - write
02:11 - snap find and then
02:15 - in the double quotes you can just write
02:18 - android hyphen studio here
02:22 - okay and when you click on enter
02:25 - you will see some results here and you
02:29 - can see
02:29 - the version available here is 4.1.2
02:33 - which is same as available
02:36 - on its website so we are going to
02:39 - install this version
02:40 - so to install android studio using snap
02:43 - you can just write
02:44 - sudo snap and then
02:48 - install and whatever software you want
02:51 - to install you want to install android
02:53 - studio
02:54 - so we are going to write android studio
02:56 - hyphen hyphen
02:57 - classic which is the note here right
03:00 - so sudo snap install android sudo hyphen
03:03 - happen classic which is going to install
03:05 - the latest version
03:07 - and give your ubuntu's password which is
03:09 - going to start the download
03:11 - of this uh android studio
03:14 - package so after some time you will see
03:16 - this message which says android studio
03:18 - 4.1.1 or whatever version you have
03:21 - installed
03:22 - from snapcrafters installed
03:25 - that means android studio is installed
03:27 - on your ubuntu operating system
03:29 - so you can close this terminal and
03:32 - now we are going to go to the
03:34 - applications section here
03:36 - and then we will search for android
03:39 - studio you can directly see this android
03:42 - studio icon here
03:43 - but if you don't see this icon just
03:46 - search for
03:48 - android here and you will be able to see
03:51 - android studio icon here so i'm going to
03:53 - just click on this icon
03:55 - which is going to open android studio on
03:58 - my ubuntu operating system for the first
04:00 - time
04:02 - now when android studio starts for the
04:04 - first time on
04:05 - your ubuntu operating system it's going
04:07 - to show you this kind of window
04:09 - which will ask you if you want to import
04:11 - android studio settings
04:13 - if you have the previous version of
04:16 - android studio already
04:18 - i don't have any android studio
04:20 - previously installed
04:22 - so i will just leave it as it is which
04:24 - is do not import settings and click on
04:26 - ok also you will see
04:29 - this window at the time of the start

04:56 - and here you can choose uh which theme
04:59 - you want for your android studio darcula
05:02 - or
05:02 - the light theme i will choose the dark
05:05 - yellow theme for
05:06 - this android studio installation and
05:09 - then click
05:10 - on the next button and now on this
05:13 - next window you will see the verify

05:28 - those settings so once you have verified
05:31 - all the
05:32 - settings you can just click on next and
05:34 - then click on finish
05:36 - and now at this point android studio is
05:38 - going to install
05:40 - all the components which you have chosen
05:43 - so just wait for the download of those
05:45 - components
05:46 - also if you want to see the details of
05:48 - this process you can click on show
05:50 - details which is going to
05:52 - show you what's happening right now so
05:55 - once the downloading of the components
05:58 - are finished i can click on the finish
06:01 - button
06:01 - which is going to start my android
06:04 - studio
06:05 - so when android studio starts it's going
06:07 - to look
06:08 - like this so you can create a project
06:11 - you can
06:12 - open an existing project from here and
06:15 - also you have all these other options
06:18 - so let's create a new project in android
06:21 - studio
06:22 - and let's see if everything is working
06:24 - fine or not so i'm going to just click
06:25 - on create a new project
06:28 - and then you can select the template
06:30 - from here i'm going to choose
06:32 - the default template which is empty
06:34 - activity
06:35 - and then click on next and here you can
06:38 - give
06:38 - the name to your project i will leave it
06:41 - as default
06:42 - because i just want to test but you can
06:44 - change the name of your project from
06:46 - here
06:47 - and also you can change the package name
06:50 - from here
06:51 - you can also choose the language in
06:53 - which you want to
06:55 - create your android studio project you
06:57 - have the option to choose java
06:59 - or kotlin here for now i'm going to
07:02 - choose
07:03 - java but if you are comfortable with
07:06 - kotlin you can choose
07:08 - kotlin from here also you can choose the
07:11 - minimum
07:12 - sdk version from here you can see
07:16 - uh all these versions by default
07:19 - android studio is going to suggest you
07:22 - uh some version
07:24 - and if you want to choose other version
07:27 - you can choose it from here so
07:29 - so let's say i'm going to choose this
07:30 - version which is api 26
07:33 - 8.0 oreo which is going to cover
07:37 - around 60 of devices and
07:40 - then i'm going to just click on finish
07:42 - which is going to create
07:44 - this android project for me so let me
07:47 - just
07:47 - maximize this window so when you create
07:50 - your android
07:51 - project for the first time it might take
07:53 - a little bit
07:54 - of time here you can see what's new in
07:58 - android studio 4.1 i'm going to just
08:00 - minimize this
08:02 - window from here and now i can see these
08:04 - two files which are mainactivity.xml
08:07 - file
08:07 - and mainactivity.java file
08:10 - you will also see at the bottom that
08:12 - gradle is installing some packages
08:15 - so i need to wait until all the gradle
08:18 - packages
08:18 - are downloaded so now once the gradle
08:21 - download is complete
08:23 - i can see all the project files here
08:26 - and i can click on the main
08:31 - underscoreactivity.xml file and when i
08:33 - click on
08:34 - this xml file i can see three modes here
08:38 - one is the design mode where you can
08:40 - design your ui
08:42 - other is the code mode where you can
08:46 - write the ui design in the form
08:49 - of this xml file and the third
08:52 - is the split view where you can see the
08:55 - design
08:56 - as well as the xml file also also you
08:59 - can see the terminal option here so you
09:02 - can
09:02 - open the terminal inside the android
09:04 - studio
09:05 - and you have this build option where you
09:08 - will be able to see
09:09 - if your build was successful or not
09:12 - so you can see the last build was
09:15 - successful
09:17 - and it says build successful in 5
09:20 - minutes
09:20 - and 30 seconds also when you go
09:24 - on the top you will be able to see by
09:26 - default
09:27 - the device on which your android
09:31 - program is going to run which comes with
09:34 - the android studio by default and
09:37 - let's run this program and let's see
09:39 - what happens when i click on this
09:42 - run button so so because the build was
09:45 - already successful i can just
09:47 - click on the run app button which is
09:50 - going to open this kind of
09:51 - android emulator on my ubuntu operating
09:55 - system which comes with the installation
09:58 - of the android studio so this emulator
10:01 - is installed at the time of the
10:03 - installation of android studio so i
10:05 - haven't installed
10:06 - this emulator separately right so when
10:10 - you run
10:11 - your app it's going to open
10:14 - your emulator and show you the output so
10:17 - just wait for
10:18 - some time until this output is shown so
10:20 - this process might take
10:22 - few seconds to few minutes if you're
10:24 - running this
10:25 - android studio and this emulator for the
10:28 - first time
10:29 - now for some reason if your emulator
10:33 - doesn't show the output
10:34 - as in my case you can also add a new
10:37 - device using the
10:38 - avd manager so to open the avd manager
10:42 - you can just click on tools and then
10:44 - click
10:44 - on the avd manager and you can see
10:48 - uh right now i have one device which
10:51 - supports
10:51 - api version 30 which is
10:55 - different than my project right so i can
10:58 - just create
10:59 - a new virtual device and here i can
11:02 - choose
11:03 - any uh phone i will just choose uh
11:06 - the phone so let's say i'm going to
11:08 - choose nexus 5
11:10 - for this demo and then click on next
11:14 - and you can see uh which version you
11:17 - want to target from here
11:19 - i'm going to choose this one which is
11:21 - oreo
11:22 - because i have selected oreo in the
11:25 - creation of the project also so i'm
11:27 - going to just
11:28 - click on download and then click on
11:30 - accept
11:31 - next and then it's going to start the
11:33 - download of
11:34 - this device and once this device is
11:36 - installed i can just click on the finish
11:38 - button here
11:40 - and you can see this device is added so
11:43 - i can just select
11:44 - once again oreo api level 26 and then
11:47 - click on next and then i can choose
11:49 - the setup orientation from here and the
11:52 - avd
11:53 - name from here i will leave everything
11:55 - as default and then click on finish
11:57 - which is going to add this device in
12:00 - my virtual devices list right
12:04 - so once this device is added you can
12:06 - just
12:07 - select this device and then close this
12:09 - window or
12:10 - you can just choose this new device
12:13 - which
12:14 - you have added so i can choose this
12:16 - nexus 5 api
12:17 - 26 here and then click on the
12:21 - run button once again and now i can see
12:24 - my app is
12:25 - launched on this emulator and also i can
12:28 - see this success message which says
12:30 - operation
12:30 - succeeded and it says hello world
12:33 - because by default
12:35 - this text view contained this text
12:38 - which is hello world right you can see
12:41 - this text here also
12:43 - so now we have successfully installed
12:46 - android studio on our ubuntu operating
12:48 - system
12:49 - and we have also successfully created
12:52 - an android studio project
12:55 - on ubuntu operating system so i hope you
12:59 - enjoyed this video and i will see you
13:01 - in the next video
