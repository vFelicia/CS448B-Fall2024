00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - maven to troll for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can create our
00:07 - first java project using maven for
00:11 - example I have created a directory in
00:13 - which I want to create my first java
00:16 - project using maven so if you don't have
00:20 - this directory you can create it and
00:22 - then just copy the part of this
00:24 - directory and then open your command
00:27 - prompt if you don't know how to do this
00:29 - you can right-click on your Windows 8
00:31 - Start menu button and then click command
00:34 - prompt and then just right CD which will
00:38 - change the directory for you and then
00:40 - paste the path you have copied and then
00:43 - press ENTER now to create a maven
00:48 - project what you need to do is you can
00:51 - give this type of command which is MVN
00:55 - then just write archetype and then
00:59 - coolin generate and what does this come
01:04 - and do this maven archetype generate
01:08 - command is used to generate project from
01:11 - an existing template now normally what
01:15 - happens is if you are a developer and if
01:19 - you are not using maven then you need to
01:23 - make the project structure by yourself
01:26 - and this in itself is very tedious task
01:30 - if you want to be a perfect you know if
01:33 - you want to make a perfect directory
01:35 - structure for your project and if you
01:38 - are a new Java developer then you may do
01:42 - mistakes while creating this directory
01:45 - structures and this command will help
01:48 - you to create a perfect directory
01:50 - structure for you now there are several
01:54 - archetypes defined by many developers
01:58 - and project routes on the maven
02:01 - repository online and when you give this
02:05 - command what it's going to do so let's
02:08 - press ENTER and let's see what happens
02:10 - but before giving this command make sure
02:14 - that you are connected to internet
02:16 - because it's going to download some
02:19 - plugins from internet so just press
02:22 - enter and once you press enter is going
02:27 - to download those plugins you can see
02:30 - it's scanning for projects and then it's
02:33 - started downloading some files from here
02:38 - now what it's downloading these
02:41 - downloads files are something which are
02:44 - called maven archetype plug-in which are
02:49 - required whenever you are going to
02:52 - create your first maven project and
02:55 - whenever you give this maven archetype
02:59 - generate command it's going to search
03:03 - for these plugins in your computer first
03:06 - at a specified location and if it's not
03:10 - found or if these plugins are not found
03:13 - then maven is going to download these
03:17 - plugins and then put it in that
03:21 - directory for you and this is going to
03:24 - be done for the first time maybe from
03:26 - the next time if you already have this
03:29 - plug-in maven will not download these
03:32 - plugins for you now after downloading
03:36 - all the plugins maven will give you this
03:39 - these options and you can see these
03:42 - numbers here 15,000 60 and when you
03:46 - scroll up you can see lots of numbers
03:49 - and some text is written in front of
03:53 - them these are all the archetypes right
03:57 - so these are all the archetypes from
03:59 - which you can choose from and by default
04:04 - maven will choose a maven archetype
04:07 - Quick Start archetype which is basically
04:10 - to create a maven hollow wall project
04:14 - with source and test classes and you can
04:17 - see the number of this archetype this
04:20 - number can be different in your case
04:22 - because these archetype number changes
04:26 - you know with time so in your case if
04:30 - you are using this maven archetype
04:32 - generate command this default number can
04:35 - be different in your case okay now if
04:39 - you want to create this sample project
04:42 - you can here press Enter instead of
04:45 - writing any number and it's going to
04:48 - create a sample project for you
04:50 - otherwise you can choose a number from
04:53 - this list of archetypes this list of our
04:57 - types will give you all kind of project
05:02 - templates here for example you want to
05:05 - choose some kind of restful script
05:09 - spring project then you can choose this
05:12 - number which is 1556 for example or you
05:17 - can browse through this list and choose
05:20 - the project or kind of project you want
05:24 - to make so right now we want to make a
05:27 - default project so you can just write
05:30 - which is this number I am typing here or
05:33 - otherwise you can press ENTER directly
05:36 - without writing any number here so let's
05:39 - press ENTER to create a sample project
05:43 - and now it's going to give you these
05:46 - options but what are these options
05:50 - so since archetypes are the template and
05:53 - they intend to reflect the current best
05:56 - practice they can evolve in time
06:00 - thus they have their own versions maven
06:04 - will ask you which version of archetype
06:08 - you want to use so you can say different
06:11 - type of versions are listed here we are
06:14 - going to choose the last option which is
06:17 - the latest version but if you want to
06:20 - choose the previous versions you can you
06:23 - know freely do this so I'm going to just
06:26 - type six here which is reflecting 1.1
06:30 - version and I'm going to press ENTER now
06:34 - in the next step we will be asked to
06:37 - provide the group ID
06:39 - now why this group ID is asked now every
06:44 - maven project have its group ID artifact
06:48 - ID and version and maven will ask you to
06:53 - provide these IDs in three steps first
06:58 - it will ask you to provide group ID then
07:01 - it will ask you to provide artifact ID
07:03 - and then it will ask you to provide the
07:06 - version and this group ID is generally a
07:09 - unique amongst an organization or a
07:13 - project now for example your
07:17 - organization is for example code bind
07:20 - you are working for an organization
07:23 - called cool bind and the website for
07:26 - this you know organization is code bind
07:31 - comm so the convention is to give the
07:35 - website of this organization in reverse
07:39 - order for example your organization
07:42 - website is code been calm so you can
07:45 - provide here calm dot code bind ok and
07:51 - this can be your unique group ID okay
07:55 - and now we are going to press ENTER and
07:59 - now we are asked with this artifact ID
08:03 - now what is this artifact ID the
08:07 - artifact ID is generally the name that
08:11 - the project is known by so you can give
08:16 - the name of your project for example my
08:19 - first maven project or my maven project
08:26 - now let's press ENTER and now it's
08:29 - asking us for the version and it has
08:33 - given us this small hint here which is
08:36 - 1.0 - snapshot we are going to give the
08:40 - exact same version name which it has
08:44 - given us so just write 1.0 - or - snap
08:51 - shot so
08:53 - this is called something like 1.0 -
08:57 - snapshot so whenever you see a project
09:02 - with a version something like this which
09:06 - has this keyword called snapshot then
09:09 - it's in the development or you know
09:12 - version right so it's not a release
09:15 - version but it's a development version
09:17 - so this snapshot keyword indicate that
09:21 - it's a snapshot version now whenever you
09:24 - build your project you can generate a
09:28 - jar file or a war file for your project
09:31 - and the jar or wire file name will be
09:35 - this name which is artifact ID dot your
09:41 - version name so artifact ID is my maven
09:45 - project dot 1.0 - snapshot and then the
09:50 - extension for example dot jar so press
09:53 - enter and now it's going to ask you for
09:57 - the package and it's giving us this hint
10:00 - also so we will follow the hint we will
10:05 - just give comm dot code bind but we are
10:10 - going to generate of a code inside this
10:13 - demo folder right so whenever maven is
10:19 - going to create the sample project this
10:23 - will be created in this you know folder
10:26 - structure comm code bind on demo and
10:28 - inside this folder is going to create
10:32 - your class directory and your test you
10:37 - know directory
10:38 - okay so just provide this and then press
10:41 - ENTER and once you press ENTER maven
10:45 - will ask you to confirm your choices for
10:48 - the group ID artifact ID version and
10:51 - package name and if you agree with these
10:54 - you know values you can just give Y and
10:59 - then press Enter
11:01 - and then maven is going to create your
11:05 - folder
11:05 - structure for you and you can see build
11:09 - success it means you're you know folder
11:12 - is created all your amazing project is
11:15 - created so you can browse to the
11:17 - directory in which you want to create
11:20 - your project and you can see your
11:23 - project name my maven project which we
11:26 - have given here you can see my maven
11:29 - project right and inside this my maven
11:32 - project you can find this source
11:35 - directory and this poem about XML this
11:39 - introduction of pom dot XML I have given
11:42 - you in the first video but we will see
11:45 - this in detail in the next video and
11:48 - let's go inside our source folder and
11:51 - inside this source folder we have our
11:54 - main directory and inside the main
11:56 - directory we have this Java directory
11:59 - and then com then code bind and then
12:02 - demo and then we have the sample Java
12:05 - class for us right once again we will go
12:09 - to the source directory and this time we
12:11 - will go to the test directory it also
12:14 - has Java comm would bind demo and then
12:18 - your sample test class ok so this is how
12:24 - you can generate your first Java project
12:28 - template using maven now in the next
12:32 - video we will see some more details of
12:35 - this project and what this palm dot XML
12:40 - is and we will you know move forward
12:42 - with our tutorial so stay tuned and
12:46 - please rate comment and subscribe and
12:47 - bye for now
