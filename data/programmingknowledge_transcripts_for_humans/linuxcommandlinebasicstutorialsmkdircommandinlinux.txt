With timestamps:

00:00 - so mkdir command is nothing but uh like
00:02 - it just stands for the make directory
00:04 - okay what the directory means like in
00:06 - linux we basically
00:08 - uh call directly but in the other uh
00:11 - operating system like windows what we
00:13 - call it as a folder so directly
00:15 - something basically like a folder you
00:17 - can uh like you can say like that okay
00:19 - direct is like a folder so now what i
00:21 - was talking about are to create a
00:23 - directory so what we will do uh we will
00:26 - uh take uh
00:28 - like a
00:30 - structure to create a directory okay so
00:33 - let me draw a structure for you
00:40 - this is a website where you can easily
00:43 - like
00:44 - draw any kind of structure or whatever
00:46 - you want okay
00:49 - i want to create a blank diagram create
00:53 - okay save it anywhere i don't care
00:59 - safe oh sorry
01:01 - test
01:06 - okay here it is now what we will do uh
01:11 - we will create first uh
01:14 - university
01:17 - okay
01:19 - then
01:22 - in that university
01:24 - we will create
01:27 - students
01:31 - okay
01:33 - and
01:34 - then we will
01:37 - create
01:40 - facalities
01:44 - and then we will create
01:48 - uh
01:50 - you can
01:51 - call it as a workers okay
01:54 - and in the student section we will
01:57 - create uh
02:00 - like
02:01 - we will name it uh one of the student
02:03 - like ayush okay
02:05 - or
02:07 - something like xyz okay and similarly in
02:10 - the faculties
02:12 - uh you want to give it as some kind of
02:14 - uh
02:15 - instead of faculty here i will try to
02:18 - give it a subject okay
02:20 - now here we will write linux
02:23 - networking
02:24 - okay and we will leave the workers has a
02:27 - blank okay so we will follow this
02:28 - pattern to create a directory so this
02:30 - will be helpful to like when you play
02:32 - with you will get a better idea like and
02:34 - also you will get a practice about the
02:37 - cd command that we have learned earlier
02:39 - in the last video okay
02:41 - so uh
02:43 - how will we proceed
02:45 - i will try to just uh
02:48 - off the screen
02:50 - i hope it should be visible to you
02:54 - okay yeah now it is visible
02:57 - and now what we will do
02:59 - i will clear the screen and we will do
03:01 - just ls okay
03:03 - so here what we have we have just
03:05 - desktop downloads pictures snap and
03:07 - these things okay
03:08 - and i will try to hit just pwd pwd we
03:11 - are in where we are in the home
03:13 - directory
03:14 - now what i will do i will create a first
03:16 - university directory okay
03:19 - so i will get m k d i r and then i will
03:23 - write university
03:25 - okay
03:27 - i have created university let's say ls
03:30 - okay
03:30 - so here you can see uh we have got the
03:33 - university directory now what i have to
03:35 - do in the university i have to create
03:38 - this students directory subject
03:40 - and workers okay first what we will do
03:42 - we will create these directories one by
03:44 - one then after the after
03:47 - the whole this completion of the whole
03:49 - diagram
03:50 - sorry what we will do
03:53 - we will create these three directory
03:55 - like in a row okay in a single command
03:57 - we will do it okay
03:58 - so let's do it first single uh single
04:01 - okay so i will first go into the
04:04 - university directory
04:06 - cd
04:07 - and then we will do ls there is nothing
04:09 - what i will do i will create a student
04:11 - directory students
04:14 - okay
04:15 - then i will create
04:17 - when you kill upper key then you will
04:19 - get the previous command okay
04:21 - then i will create subject
04:24 - then i will create
04:27 - workers okay
04:29 - so now i will do ls so here you can see
04:31 - we have got the three directories now
04:33 - what i have to do i have to create uh
04:35 - more directors in
04:38 - uh students so here is one thing also i
04:40 - want to tell you about like here
04:42 - students in this students uh you will
04:44 - see the s capital but when i will try to
04:47 - hit
04:48 - s with the small
04:50 - then what happens no such follow
04:51 - directory why because this is a case
04:53 - sensitive in linux it follows case sense
04:55 - activity okay that's why it happens now
04:57 - what i will do see capital is then tap
05:00 - on
05:01 - now
05:02 - okay
05:03 - students now where we are we are in the
05:05 - students directory when i will do pwd
05:07 - what we will get we'll get the exact
05:11 - location where we are okay so now what
05:14 - we have to do first of all i want to
05:15 - clear this whole thing okay now what i
05:18 - will do i will create two
05:20 - directors with name
05:23 - ayush and with name
05:27 - uh
05:30 - unkit
05:31 - okay
05:33 - ls i using it has been created okay
05:36 - now what i will do i have to go back in
05:39 - the subject directory so how we can do
05:41 - it we will do the cd
05:43 - dot dot remember in the last video we
05:46 - talked about this
05:47 - cd dot dot
05:49 - and here now where i am
05:51 - i am in the university when i will do ls
05:53 - i will have the access of subject and
05:54 - workers also what i will do now i will
05:57 - just do cd
05:59 - subject
06:01 - okay
06:02 - and then i can bluetooth we are in the
06:03 - subject directory now what i do i have
06:05 - to create
06:07 - two directories
06:09 - linux
06:10 - and then
06:13 - networking
06:14 - okay now i'll do ls here you can see
06:17 - linux networking has been created and in
06:20 - the workers directory we don't have to
06:21 - write anything or we don't have to
06:23 - create any kind of folder in it okay so
06:25 - this is the basically like simple
06:27 - process of creating files and
06:28 - directories in the linux and now i will
06:30 - tell you some like
06:35 - means i will do like
06:36 - creating these whole things in a single
06:38 - command okay not whole things but yeah
06:40 - this one and this one i will try to
06:42 - create okay
06:44 - so what i will do
06:46 - uh i will go in the home directory again
06:50 - clear now
06:51 - and i will show you here also
06:54 - like how
06:56 - in the file system it will look like
06:58 - whether it is there or not okay
07:00 - uh yeah here you can see university
07:03 - directors here in the university we have
07:05 - student subject workers and in the
07:06 - students we have ayush and
07:09 - and back and in the subject we have
07:12 - linux and networking and now what i will
07:14 - do i will just delete this directory
07:16 - okay
07:18 - uh
07:20 - from here i can delete okay to delete
07:22 - the directories and all i will tell you
07:24 - this in the next video okay
07:27 - otherwise everything will get mixed up
07:29 - okay
07:30 - so now if i will do ls here so there is
07:33 - no university folder is there now what i
07:35 - will do i will just create a university
07:36 - folder
07:38 - uh sorry university
07:40 - okay now university has been created i
07:43 - will move into this directory
07:45 - and now i have to do you know i have to
07:47 - create student subject workers so what i
07:49 - can do mkdir
07:52 - students
07:53 - okay
07:55 - space
07:57 - subject
07:59 - i think spelling mistake is there
08:00 - something okay yeah subject
08:02 - and then i will get workers
08:06 - boom now let's hit ls then you will get
08:09 - something
08:10 - yeah so here what we are doing in the
08:12 - same and the single command we are
08:14 - creating three directories or you can
08:16 - create multiple direction uh it all
08:19 - depends on you how much you want to
08:20 - create okay
08:21 - and now what i have to do in the
08:22 - students we have to create ayush and
08:25 - xyz
08:26 - so how i will do mkdir
08:30 - in the
08:32 - students
08:34 - sorry sorry uh
08:37 - okay sorry for it uh
08:46 - this is ls okay now what i have to do i
08:48 - will go in the students directory
08:52 - students okay
08:55 - now what i will do i will create again
08:57 - the both
08:58 - ios and get
09:00 - like before i use it okay
09:03 - ls
09:04 - same okay so this is the like one way to
09:07 - create multiple directories at in a
09:09 - single command okay so i hope you got it
09:11 - how you can create a multiple
09:12 - directories okay i'm not going to show
09:15 - you for the subject like it will be then
09:17 - you will get bored like i'm like
09:19 - displaying the same things again and
09:20 - again okay so now let me tell you
09:22 - something more interesting things okay i
09:24 - will clear
09:26 - and then go back into the home directory
09:28 - clear everything ls
09:31 - and now what i will do now
09:33 - i want to tell you some more concepts
09:35 - like uh the options which we can use
09:38 - with the
09:39 - uh hyphen p command okay so the first
09:42 - option which i want to show you like
09:43 - hyphen v that stands for verbose
09:46 - so when we will do this mkdir hyphen v
09:49 - it will tell you the uh like
09:51 - whether directory has been created or
09:53 - not okay so let's me let me create
09:57 - like
10:00 - what anything linux okay here you can
10:04 - see
10:05 - creator directory
10:07 - linux again uh let me tell you again i
10:09 - want to create same directive let's see
10:11 - what happens
10:13 - here you can see
10:14 - cannot create directory linux file exist
10:16 - what if i remove hyphen b whether it's
10:19 - still displaying or not the same error
10:22 - okay it displays the same error okay so
10:25 - but when we use hyphen v it will tell
10:27 - you the status like whether direct is
10:28 - created or not
10:29 - okay
10:31 - i hope it's clear hyphen v and in the
10:33 - next uh we will talk about hyphen p also
10:36 - what it does hyphen p uh like when we
10:39 - suppose we want to create a directory in
10:42 - which like university in the university
10:45 - students and then in this room we want
10:47 - ayush okay
10:48 - i wish we want only
10:50 - okay
10:51 - so how we can do it uh but before uh
10:54 - that i will need to
10:56 - ah sorry i will not delete that okay
10:58 - i'll let it be i will get some more uh
11:01 - extra scenario like uh
11:07 - let's create uh some kind of uh
11:11 - like
11:12 - uh um
11:15 - sun
11:17 - and with sun let's create a
11:23 - hair father
11:30 - and then
11:31 - we will create obviously grandfather
11:34 - okay or we can go the words also i think
11:38 - i have
11:39 - created in the reverse motion should be
11:42 - in the last okay
11:44 - grandfather okay now what i will do
11:47 - mkdir hyphen p option
11:50 - and sun
11:52 - slash
11:53 - father
11:57 - grandfather
11:59 - okay so basically this command what it
12:01 - will it will create the like in the sun
12:03 - directly you will get father in the
12:04 - father director you will get the
12:07 - grandfather but if you will not you use
12:10 - hyphen p option then what will happen
12:12 - like we will not be able to create a
12:14 - directory like if one father does not
12:16 - exist then it will not create
12:19 - grandfather okay but if
12:21 - like if it exists and further exist
12:25 - okay
12:27 - sorry i
12:29 - got a little bit confused here let me
12:31 - first of all create this one okay
12:34 - ls
12:35 - it should be sun directory
12:37 - sun
12:39 - ls
12:40 - father
12:42 - ls okay so what i was trying to say like
12:45 - when we will use hyphen p option if sun
12:48 - father is not created then it will be
12:51 - get created automatically but when we
12:53 - will not use hyphen fee then it will not
12:55 - get created like uh let me go back
12:59 - and
13:00 - now what i will do i will try to create
13:01 - mkdr test one slash test2 slash test
13:07 - three it should be like in test one
13:09 - there should be test two and test two
13:10 - there should be test three
13:12 - here you can see cannot create directory
13:14 - okay no such file or direct is there
13:16 - okay so i hope you got the like actual
13:19 - role of the hyphen p option
13:21 - okay
13:22 - now this is not a more uh big deal if
13:25 - you want to if you play more and more
13:27 - with this command you will get familiar
13:29 - with this whole linux environment okay
13:31 - that's not a big deal now the next thing
13:34 - is hyphen m option okay what it does
13:36 - this is nothing but mode
13:38 - okay mode or we can say permissions like
13:41 - uh
13:42 - uh till now we have not covered the
13:44 - permission section in linux like it is
13:46 - another concept when the
13:47 - another video will come up
13:49 - on this concept like read write execute
13:52 - all these things but still i tell you
13:54 - like if the if the person will have the
13:56 - read read permission then
13:59 - that user can read the file if he has
14:01 - right then he can write the file or
14:04 - execute then he can execute that file
14:05 - but if he has all the three then he can
14:08 - do anything rewrite execute all okay
14:10 - so how we can do this mkdr hyphen m and
14:13 - we provide a equal to
14:15 - suppose we want to provide our wx
14:18 - all to the one directory that is test
14:22 - io test is not there
14:24 - yes
14:26 - this is created now what i have to do ls
14:28 - hyphen l you can see here the permission
14:30 - of all these things
14:33 - and here you can see where it is test
14:36 - so
14:37 - r w x rw x rw did that execute
14:40 - and there is something like rwx for
14:42 - users and another this rw is for group
14:45 - and another this rwx is for
14:48 - other persons okay
14:49 - so when we will do test in this we when
14:52 - we will go in this directory we can do
14:54 - any kind of operation mkd sorry mkdir
14:57 - test blah blah blah okay we can do
14:59 - anything but now what i will do
15:02 - i will try to create
15:03 - uh one directory with only read
15:05 - operations okay so let's see what
15:08 - happens whether we
15:10 - are able to create or not anything in
15:12 - that particular direct whether we have a
15:14 - permission or not
15:15 - so what i will do mkdir hyphen m a equal
15:19 - to i want to give just read operation we
15:22 - can only read
15:24 - read and i will create test
15:28 - three
15:30 - let's draw less iphone l
15:33 - and now you can see in test d we have
15:35 - only read permission to everyone
15:38 - users also groups also
15:41 - and others
15:43 - i think others have not any permission
15:45 - okay here
15:46 - okay
15:47 - now i will go in the test three
15:51 - test three so here you can see
15:54 - permission denied we don't have x access
15:57 - to that folder so now who can access
15:59 - this folder there is also one user in
16:01 - the linux body
16:03 - root on the root can access
16:06 - okay uh
16:09 - so that's all about this in this video
16:11 - like uh mkdr command so i hope you liked
16:14 - it and uh please like share subscribe
16:18 - our youtube channel and now we will meet
16:19 - in the next video with another basic
16:21 - command like in the next video we will
16:23 - basically talk about the whole deck
16:25 - which we have created we will then again
16:27 - we will create some directory then we
16:28 - will delete it whether direct is empty
16:31 - then what what we can do if it is not
16:33 - empty then how we can delete it so these
16:35 - are all the things which we will cover
16:36 - in the next video so that's all for
16:37 - today and we will meet in the next one
16:38 - thank you thank you so much for watching

Cleaned transcript:

so mkdir command is nothing but uh like it just stands for the make directory okay what the directory means like in linux we basically uh call directly but in the other uh operating system like windows what we call it as a folder so directly something basically like a folder you can uh like you can say like that okay direct is like a folder so now what i was talking about are to create a directory so what we will do uh we will uh take uh like a structure to create a directory okay so let me draw a structure for you this is a website where you can easily like draw any kind of structure or whatever you want okay i want to create a blank diagram create okay save it anywhere i don't care safe oh sorry test okay here it is now what we will do uh we will create first uh university okay then in that university we will create students okay and then we will create facalities and then we will create uh you can call it as a workers okay and in the student section we will create uh like we will name it uh one of the student like ayush okay or something like xyz okay and similarly in the faculties uh you want to give it as some kind of uh instead of faculty here i will try to give it a subject okay now here we will write linux networking okay and we will leave the workers has a blank okay so we will follow this pattern to create a directory so this will be helpful to like when you play with you will get a better idea like and also you will get a practice about the cd command that we have learned earlier in the last video okay so uh how will we proceed i will try to just uh off the screen i hope it should be visible to you okay yeah now it is visible and now what we will do i will clear the screen and we will do just ls okay so here what we have we have just desktop downloads pictures snap and these things okay and i will try to hit just pwd pwd we are in where we are in the home directory now what i will do i will create a first university directory okay so i will get m k d i r and then i will write university okay i have created university let's say ls okay so here you can see uh we have got the university directory now what i have to do in the university i have to create this students directory subject and workers okay first what we will do we will create these directories one by one then after the after the whole this completion of the whole diagram sorry what we will do we will create these three directory like in a row okay in a single command we will do it okay so let's do it first single uh single okay so i will first go into the university directory cd and then we will do ls there is nothing what i will do i will create a student directory students okay then i will create when you kill upper key then you will get the previous command okay then i will create subject then i will create workers okay so now i will do ls so here you can see we have got the three directories now what i have to do i have to create uh more directors in uh students so here is one thing also i want to tell you about like here students in this students uh you will see the s capital but when i will try to hit s with the small then what happens no such follow directory why because this is a case sensitive in linux it follows case sense activity okay that's why it happens now what i will do see capital is then tap on now okay students now where we are we are in the students directory when i will do pwd what we will get we'll get the exact location where we are okay so now what we have to do first of all i want to clear this whole thing okay now what i will do i will create two directors with name ayush and with name uh unkit okay ls i using it has been created okay now what i will do i have to go back in the subject directory so how we can do it we will do the cd dot dot remember in the last video we talked about this cd dot dot and here now where i am i am in the university when i will do ls i will have the access of subject and workers also what i will do now i will just do cd subject okay and then i can bluetooth we are in the subject directory now what i do i have to create two directories linux and then networking okay now i'll do ls here you can see linux networking has been created and in the workers directory we don't have to write anything or we don't have to create any kind of folder in it okay so this is the basically like simple process of creating files and directories in the linux and now i will tell you some like means i will do like creating these whole things in a single command okay not whole things but yeah this one and this one i will try to create okay so what i will do uh i will go in the home directory again clear now and i will show you here also like how in the file system it will look like whether it is there or not okay uh yeah here you can see university directors here in the university we have student subject workers and in the students we have ayush and and back and in the subject we have linux and networking and now what i will do i will just delete this directory okay uh from here i can delete okay to delete the directories and all i will tell you this in the next video okay otherwise everything will get mixed up okay so now if i will do ls here so there is no university folder is there now what i will do i will just create a university folder uh sorry university okay now university has been created i will move into this directory and now i have to do you know i have to create student subject workers so what i can do mkdir students okay space subject i think spelling mistake is there something okay yeah subject and then i will get workers boom now let's hit ls then you will get something yeah so here what we are doing in the same and the single command we are creating three directories or you can create multiple direction uh it all depends on you how much you want to create okay and now what i have to do in the students we have to create ayush and xyz so how i will do mkdir in the students sorry sorry uh okay sorry for it uh this is ls okay now what i have to do i will go in the students directory students okay now what i will do i will create again the both ios and get like before i use it okay ls same okay so this is the like one way to create multiple directories at in a single command okay so i hope you got it how you can create a multiple directories okay i'm not going to show you for the subject like it will be then you will get bored like i'm like displaying the same things again and again okay so now let me tell you something more interesting things okay i will clear and then go back into the home directory clear everything ls and now what i will do now i want to tell you some more concepts like uh the options which we can use with the uh hyphen p command okay so the first option which i want to show you like hyphen v that stands for verbose so when we will do this mkdir hyphen v it will tell you the uh like whether directory has been created or not okay so let's me let me create like what anything linux okay here you can see creator directory linux again uh let me tell you again i want to create same directive let's see what happens here you can see cannot create directory linux file exist what if i remove hyphen b whether it's still displaying or not the same error okay it displays the same error okay so but when we use hyphen v it will tell you the status like whether direct is created or not okay i hope it's clear hyphen v and in the next uh we will talk about hyphen p also what it does hyphen p uh like when we suppose we want to create a directory in which like university in the university students and then in this room we want ayush okay i wish we want only okay so how we can do it uh but before uh that i will need to ah sorry i will not delete that okay i'll let it be i will get some more uh extra scenario like uh let's create uh some kind of uh like uh um sun and with sun let's create a hair father and then we will create obviously grandfather okay or we can go the words also i think i have created in the reverse motion should be in the last okay grandfather okay now what i will do mkdir hyphen p option and sun slash father grandfather okay so basically this command what it will it will create the like in the sun directly you will get father in the father director you will get the grandfather but if you will not you use hyphen p option then what will happen like we will not be able to create a directory like if one father does not exist then it will not create grandfather okay but if like if it exists and further exist okay sorry i got a little bit confused here let me first of all create this one okay ls it should be sun directory sun ls father ls okay so what i was trying to say like when we will use hyphen p option if sun father is not created then it will be get created automatically but when we will not use hyphen fee then it will not get created like uh let me go back and now what i will do i will try to create mkdr test one slash test2 slash test three it should be like in test one there should be test two and test two there should be test three here you can see cannot create directory okay no such file or direct is there okay so i hope you got the like actual role of the hyphen p option okay now this is not a more uh big deal if you want to if you play more and more with this command you will get familiar with this whole linux environment okay that's not a big deal now the next thing is hyphen m option okay what it does this is nothing but mode okay mode or we can say permissions like uh uh till now we have not covered the permission section in linux like it is another concept when the another video will come up on this concept like read write execute all these things but still i tell you like if the if the person will have the read read permission then that user can read the file if he has right then he can write the file or execute then he can execute that file but if he has all the three then he can do anything rewrite execute all okay so how we can do this mkdr hyphen m and we provide a equal to suppose we want to provide our wx all to the one directory that is test io test is not there yes this is created now what i have to do ls hyphen l you can see here the permission of all these things and here you can see where it is test so r w x rw x rw did that execute and there is something like rwx for users and another this rw is for group and another this rwx is for other persons okay so when we will do test in this we when we will go in this directory we can do any kind of operation mkd sorry mkdir test blah blah blah okay we can do anything but now what i will do i will try to create uh one directory with only read operations okay so let's see what happens whether we are able to create or not anything in that particular direct whether we have a permission or not so what i will do mkdir hyphen m a equal to i want to give just read operation we can only read read and i will create test three let's draw less iphone l and now you can see in test d we have only read permission to everyone users also groups also and others i think others have not any permission okay here okay now i will go in the test three test three so here you can see permission denied we don't have x access to that folder so now who can access this folder there is also one user in the linux body root on the root can access okay uh so that's all about this in this video like uh mkdr command so i hope you liked it and uh please like share subscribe our youtube channel and now we will meet in the next video with another basic command like in the next video we will basically talk about the whole deck which we have created we will then again we will create some directory then we will delete it whether direct is empty then what what we can do if it is not empty then how we can delete it so these are all the things which we will cover in the next video so that's all for today and we will meet in the next one thank you thank you so much for watching
