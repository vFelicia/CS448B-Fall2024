00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shelf scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last video we have seen how to
00:06 - use if statement else statement and
00:09 - if-else statement in shell script now in
00:12 - this video we will use those if
00:15 - statements to check for the file test
00:19 - operators so let's get started so for
00:23 - example or most of the times when you
00:26 - are writing shell script you are dealing
00:27 - with the files and for example if you
00:31 - want to check whether file exists or not
00:33 - or if you want want to check whether
00:36 - this file is a regular file or its block
00:41 - special file or it's a character special
00:44 - file or many other options if you want
00:47 - to check you can use these file test
00:50 - operator to check for those you know
00:54 - conditions so let's see how we can use
00:58 - those conditions so what I'm going to do
01:01 - is first of all I am going to echo
01:03 - statement for example I will say enter
01:07 - the name of the file and for you know
01:13 - printing the input on the same line I am
01:16 - going to use backslash c and this
01:19 - backslash c is used to keep the cursor
01:23 - nor cursor on the same line after the
01:25 - end of the echo now in order to
01:28 - interpret this backslash c you need to
01:32 - use the flag - e here now - e flag is
01:37 - used to you know enable the
01:41 - interpretation of this backslash so
01:44 - otherwise if you don't use - e is going
01:48 - to print this backslash 3 literally but
01:51 - if you use - es with this statement then
01:55 - it's going to interpret this backslash
01:57 - and then it is going to you know keep
02:00 - the cursor on the same line as the echo
02:03 - command line right so write this and
02:07 - then we are going to use the read
02:09 - command to read and then we
02:13 - to read the filename to just write file
02:16 - name for example and then we are going
02:19 - to use the if statement so just use if
02:22 - and then for if statement what we use we
02:26 - use the square brackets and then in the
02:31 - square brackets we will use a flag for
02:34 - example if we want to check whether the
02:37 - file exists or not so there is a special
02:39 - flag called minus e and then the file
02:44 - name so the file name is in the file
02:48 - name variable so after dollar just use
02:51 - this right and then we use then and then
02:55 - we need to use the echo command for
02:58 - example so we will just say if the file
03:01 - exists we will print first of all the
03:05 - file name so let's say this is the file
03:08 - name and then we will just say file
03:11 - found right otherwise in the else
03:16 - condition we will just write here in the
03:19 - else condition else and then we will
03:23 - just say file not found right so same
03:26 - line and then we will say not found not
03:30 - found right and then we will end the
03:33 - line by and the if statement by fi okay
03:38 - so let's run this script and let's see
03:41 - what happens
03:41 - so I am going to just run on my script
03:45 - and then press Enter let's ask me enter
03:48 - the name of the file and you can see the
03:51 - cursor is on the same line which is due
03:53 - to this backslash and - 'flag right so
03:58 - I'm going to give the name of the file
04:00 - which doesn't exist for example ABC or
04:04 - some some random file name okay and then
04:07 - press Enter it says this file named not
04:11 - found okay now let me create a file so I
04:14 - am going to use a touch command for this
04:17 - so touch for example I'm going to name
04:20 - my file as
04:22 - test for example okay and then plus
04:25 - enter which is going to create the stat
04:27 - file and then I'm going to run the
04:31 - script once again and then I'm going to
04:33 - write the name of the file which is a
04:36 - test which I have created and then press
04:38 - Enter and now it says test found which
04:42 - is the test file which I have created
04:44 - okay so this - e flag is used to check
04:51 - whether the file exists or not okay
04:55 - now there are some other options also
04:58 - which we can use so for example to check
05:02 - whether the file you know if it's a file
05:08 - or not you can just use a flag called F
05:11 - okay so E is for if the file exists or
05:15 - not
05:15 - f is the is for the file exists and if
05:19 - it's a regular file or not okay
05:22 - so let's use F and let's run the script
05:27 - once again and once again we will just
05:29 - say test and then press ENTER and save
05:32 - the test found because we have created
05:35 - the regular file using the touch command
05:37 - right so F flag is for checking whether
05:41 - file exists and if it's a regular file
05:45 - or not right now if you want to check
05:47 - for the directories you can use the flag
05:49 - D okay so let's so you know run the
05:54 - script once again and even if it's
05:56 - saying you know enter the name of the
05:59 - file we are going to enter the name of
06:02 - the directory for example first of all
06:05 - the directory name which doesn't exist
06:07 - so dir which does not exist on my you
06:11 - know folder or directory and then press
06:14 - ENTER and it says dir not found and
06:18 - let's create our dir directory for
06:21 - example so for this we will use MK dir
06:25 - command and then the name of the
06:28 - directory for example dir once again
06:31 - okay so this directory is created let's
06:33 - verify so you can see the
06:36 - directory dir is created right so let's
06:39 - run the script once again and then once
06:42 - again give the name of the directory and
06:44 - then press ENTER and it says that we
06:47 - found so - D flag is for checking
06:50 - whether the directory exists or not so
06:54 - it's worth checking the directories now
06:56 - there are some other flags which you can
06:59 - use for example there are two types of
07:02 - file basically one is a block special
07:06 - file and other is a character special
07:09 - file so a character special file is a
07:12 - normal file which contains some text or
07:15 - data or something like this a block
07:17 - special file is a binary file for
07:19 - example or a picture file or a video
07:22 - file it's a block special file so a file
07:25 - which contains normal text or normal
07:27 - character it's a character special file
07:30 - and other files for example video files
07:34 - or music files or you know image files
07:36 - are block special files right so for
07:41 - block special files you can use the flag
07:44 - B and for characters special file you
07:47 - can use the file C okay so for block
07:52 - special B and for character special the
07:55 - flags fee now there is a flag which
07:59 - checks whether the file is empty or not
08:02 - so for that you just need to use a flag
08:05 - called - s and it checks whether our
08:08 - file is empty or not so let's check so
08:14 - I'm going to run the script once again
08:16 - and then I'm going to give the name of
08:19 - the test file which we have created and
08:21 - then press Enter
08:23 - and it says file not found and here we
08:27 - just need to write for example file not
08:32 - empty and here we need to write file
08:37 - empty okay so once again let's run the
08:41 - test and we will give the file name test
08:45 - which is empty and save text
08:48 - d right so we can verify this by using
08:52 - LS - L command for example and you can
08:57 - see our test file is of size zero you
09:01 - can see here right now for example I
09:04 - will add some text to the file for
09:08 - example I will just use cat and then I
09:11 - will use the cat text to the test file
09:15 - right and then press Enter and I will
09:19 - write something else and then I'm going
09:20 - to press ENTER and for exiting out of
09:23 - the cat command you use control D and
09:26 - then once again let's do LS - L and you
09:30 - can see now it has some data this test
09:33 - file has some data so let's run the
09:36 - script once again and use the file name
09:40 - and now it says test not empty right so
09:44 - - f is for checking whether file is
09:48 - empty or not now there are some other
09:52 - flags also for example if you want to
09:54 - check whether your file has the read
09:57 - permission then you can use the - our
10:01 - flag if you want to check whether your
10:03 - file has the right permission you use
10:05 - the - W and if you want to check whether
10:09 - your file has the execute permission
10:10 - then you can use the X flag for this
10:15 - okay so these are some of the options
10:18 - which you can use to check for your file
10:22 - using if statement for example okay so I
10:26 - hope you enjoyed this video please rate

hey guys welcome to the next video on shelf scripting tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use if statement else statement and ifelse statement in shell script now in this video we will use those if statements to check for the file test operators so let's get started so for example or most of the times when you are writing shell script you are dealing with the files and for example if you want to check whether file exists or not or if you want want to check whether this file is a regular file or its block special file or it's a character special file or many other options if you want to check you can use these file test operator to check for those you know conditions so let's see how we can use those conditions so what I'm going to do is first of all I am going to echo statement for example I will say enter the name of the file and for you know printing the input on the same line I am going to use backslash c and this backslash c is used to keep the cursor nor cursor on the same line after the end of the echo now in order to interpret this backslash c you need to use the flag e here now e flag is used to you know enable the interpretation of this backslash so otherwise if you don't use e is going to print this backslash 3 literally but if you use es with this statement then it's going to interpret this backslash and then it is going to you know keep the cursor on the same line as the echo command line right so write this and then we are going to use the read command to read and then we to read the filename to just write file name for example and then we are going to use the if statement so just use if and then for if statement what we use we use the square brackets and then in the square brackets we will use a flag for example if we want to check whether the file exists or not so there is a special flag called minus e and then the file name so the file name is in the file name variable so after dollar just use this right and then we use then and then we need to use the echo command for example so we will just say if the file exists we will print first of all the file name so let's say this is the file name and then we will just say file found right otherwise in the else condition we will just write here in the else condition else and then we will just say file not found right so same line and then we will say not found not found right and then we will end the line by and the if statement by fi okay so let's run this script and let's see what happens so I am going to just run on my script and then press Enter let's ask me enter the name of the file and you can see the cursor is on the same line which is due to this backslash and 'flag right so I'm going to give the name of the file which doesn't exist for example ABC or some some random file name okay and then press Enter it says this file named not found okay now let me create a file so I am going to use a touch command for this so touch for example I'm going to name my file as test for example okay and then plus enter which is going to create the stat file and then I'm going to run the script once again and then I'm going to write the name of the file which is a test which I have created and then press Enter and now it says test found which is the test file which I have created okay so this e flag is used to check whether the file exists or not okay now there are some other options also which we can use so for example to check whether the file you know if it's a file or not you can just use a flag called F okay so E is for if the file exists or not f is the is for the file exists and if it's a regular file or not okay so let's use F and let's run the script once again and once again we will just say test and then press ENTER and save the test found because we have created the regular file using the touch command right so F flag is for checking whether file exists and if it's a regular file or not right now if you want to check for the directories you can use the flag D okay so let's so you know run the script once again and even if it's saying you know enter the name of the file we are going to enter the name of the directory for example first of all the directory name which doesn't exist so dir which does not exist on my you know folder or directory and then press ENTER and it says dir not found and let's create our dir directory for example so for this we will use MK dir command and then the name of the directory for example dir once again okay so this directory is created let's verify so you can see the directory dir is created right so let's run the script once again and then once again give the name of the directory and then press ENTER and it says that we found so D flag is for checking whether the directory exists or not so it's worth checking the directories now there are some other flags which you can use for example there are two types of file basically one is a block special file and other is a character special file so a character special file is a normal file which contains some text or data or something like this a block special file is a binary file for example or a picture file or a video file it's a block special file so a file which contains normal text or normal character it's a character special file and other files for example video files or music files or you know image files are block special files right so for block special files you can use the flag B and for characters special file you can use the file C okay so for block special B and for character special the flags fee now there is a flag which checks whether the file is empty or not so for that you just need to use a flag called s and it checks whether our file is empty or not so let's check so I'm going to run the script once again and then I'm going to give the name of the test file which we have created and then press Enter and it says file not found and here we just need to write for example file not empty and here we need to write file empty okay so once again let's run the test and we will give the file name test which is empty and save text d right so we can verify this by using LS L command for example and you can see our test file is of size zero you can see here right now for example I will add some text to the file for example I will just use cat and then I will use the cat text to the test file right and then press Enter and I will write something else and then I'm going to press ENTER and for exiting out of the cat command you use control D and then once again let's do LS L and you can see now it has some data this test file has some data so let's run the script once again and use the file name and now it says test not empty right so f is for checking whether file is empty or not now there are some other flags also for example if you want to check whether your file has the read permission then you can use the our flag if you want to check whether your file has the right permission you use the W and if you want to check whether your file has the execute permission then you can use the X flag for this okay so these are some of the options which you can use to check for your file using if statement for example okay so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
