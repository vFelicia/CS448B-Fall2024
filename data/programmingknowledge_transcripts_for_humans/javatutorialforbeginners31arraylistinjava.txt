00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - what are array list and how we can use
00:10 - array lists in
00:12 - Java now before this we have seen how we
00:16 - can uh declare and use Simple arrays and
00:21 - the problem with those arrays were that
00:25 - we have to provide the initial or the
00:28 - size of the array and the size of the
00:32 - array in those cases were fixed and it's
00:37 - really hard in real programming
00:40 - practices to change the size of the
00:43 - array using simple
00:45 - arrays now Java also provides a library
00:49 - called util and in this util Library
00:53 - there is uh keyword called array list
00:58 - and this array list helps us to uh
01:02 - maintain and use Dynamic arrays so
01:08 - unlike uh the simple arrays whose size
01:11 - is hard to change these uh array lists
01:16 - are dynamically created and used so you
01:20 - can decrease or increase or you know
01:23 - clear uh these array lists whatever you
01:27 - want now to use uh this array list you
01:31 - need to import this util Library so just
01:35 - write
01:36 - import jav Java dot
01:43 - util dot array list and this will add
01:49 - this uh class called array list to your
01:54 - um
01:56 - program and if you want to go inside
01:59 - this class you can can just hover over
02:00 - this and control and click on this and
02:04 - this is the inbuilt Java array list
02:07 - class you can go inside
02:09 - okay now to declare an array list in
02:13 - Java you just need this keyword called
02:15 - array
02:16 - lists so just use this keyword called
02:20 - array list and then in these angular
02:23 - bracket you can give the data type of
02:26 - the array you want to have for example
02:29 - you want to create an integer array we
02:31 - just
02:32 - write
02:34 - integer and then my list is the name of
02:38 - the array not here but it should come
02:41 - outside these angular brackets like this
02:45 - my list is equal to new array list and
02:50 - then once
02:52 - again integer and then here you can give
02:56 - the initial size and this is not the
02:59 - fixed size size this is the initial size
03:01 - you want to provide this size can be
03:04 - changed it can be increased or decreased
03:06 - depending upon your requirement now to
03:10 - add values to the array you just need
03:13 - the variable name and then just write
03:17 - add and in here you can add any value
03:20 - for example at index one we want to add
03:22 - one and in a similar way you can add
03:26 - values one by one
03:28 - here so for example second number is
03:31 - five third is uh three and we will add
03:36 - two more numbers for
03:38 - example 6 and 9 93 whatever okay so now
03:46 - for example I want to access those
03:49 - values I can use Advanced for Loop for
03:55 - iterating over this uh list so what I
03:58 - can do is
04:00 - I can just write integer X and then in
04:05 - here from my list I can iterate these
04:10 - values so in here I can just write CIS
04:14 - or control shift and in here I can just
04:18 - iterate over my list using X okay and
04:22 - once I run the program it just prints
04:26 - all the values of the arrays five values
04:29 - so five uh you know five uh times we can
04:34 - print the values okay now in order to uh
04:39 - get the size of the array you can do
04:41 - something like this so you can just
04:44 - write
04:46 - system.out.print and then the name of
04:48 - your list or array list which is
04:52 - uh my
04:56 - list here and then the do
05:01 - size and this gives you the size of the
05:04 - array okay so this is the function
05:06 - inside our AR list and this gives the
05:09 - size here you can see five to make it
05:12 - more clear I can
05:14 - just say
05:17 - size is equal to and then this plus so
05:22 - that we can see the
05:24 - size it says size is is equal to five
05:27 - okay which is true because array contain
05:30 - 1 2 3 4 five elements so bear in mind
05:35 - this size shows the number of element
05:38 - contained by the array not the initial
05:41 - size we have provided for example we
05:43 - have provided initial size as five but
05:47 - we have only added three values to the
05:51 - array right and now once we run the
05:54 - program it says size is equal to three
05:56 - so this size is not indicating the
05:59 - initial size which is this one but this
06:02 - indicates the number of element
06:04 - contained by the array so we have added
06:08 - only three element then the size will be
06:12 - three Now
06:14 - using uh this array list you can
06:18 - even remove the values for example I
06:22 - have once again five
06:25 - values I will add two more values to the
06:28 - array and these are some more
06:33 - values and for example I want to
06:36 - remove this uh element at index 2
06:42 - because index of array list also starts
06:44 - from zero so the index uh start from 0 1
06:48 - 2 3 and four so I want to delete the
06:53 - element three which is at index 2 so I
06:58 - can just use use the array my array
07:01 - which is this
07:03 - one and then I can call a method called
07:08 - dot
07:10 - remove and here I can give the index so
07:14 - I want to remove for example here at
07:16 - index 2 the value is 555 and I want to
07:20 - remove this 555 from here so I will just
07:23 - write two index
07:25 - two and then I will just once again
07:29 - print
07:30 - uh this this array after removing the
07:32 - value and I will also see the size what
07:37 - is the size of this array after removing
07:39 - this value so I will run this program
07:42 - and you can see initially our array
07:45 - contains five values and size was five
07:48 - but when we call this method remove to
07:53 - at index
07:54 - 2 then
07:56 - our size becomes four and 555 is removed
08:02 - from the AR from here right you can see
08:06 - here
08:08 - now there is a method
08:12 - called clear by which you can even clear
08:16 - all the values from the array so just my
08:19 - list do clear and then using this clear
08:23 - you can just clear all the values from
08:25 - the array so initially the size of the
08:28 - array was five
08:30 - but when you call this method on your
08:33 - list the size becomes
08:36 - zero right now for example you want to
08:40 - change some value in your array for
08:42 - example I want to change this value one
08:45 - which is at index 0 to 100 I can do this
08:49 - something like this so your array name
08:52 - then set and then it takes two Al two
08:56 - argument one is the index so I want to
08:59 - to change the value at index0 because
09:01 - one is at index 0er and I want to change
09:03 - the value of 1 to 100 so second value is
09:08 - 100 or second argument is 100 and now
09:11 - when I run the
09:12 - program the size remains same but the
09:16 - value here earlier it was one now it
09:20 - became 100
09:22 - okay so in this way you can use these
09:26 - array list in uh Java
09:29 - it contain many more method for example
09:32 - when I just use this variable name my
09:35 - list and when I just uh use dot
09:39 - separator it will give you
09:41 - suggestions and here it will give you
09:45 - some more suggestions like um you can uh
09:50 - clone this or you can have you can check
09:55 - if this uh array is empty or not or you
10:00 - can check or you can trim this array to
10:04 - the size of something so let's try to
10:07 - trim this list
10:10 - dot trim to size okay and what this
10:14 - method is doing is it trims the size of
10:17 - the array to the number of element it
10:20 - contain for example initial size of this
10:22 - array was five and we have just provided
10:26 - three then it trim your array to three
10:31 - itself in instead of initial size okay
10:35 - so trimming means just cut cutting the
10:39 - size of the array uh to the number of
10:42 - element it contains which is three so in
10:45 - this way you can use many more method on
10:48 - this list but I hope you have enjoyed uh
10:51 - I mean you have learned the basic
10:53 - concept of array list and I hope you
10:56 - have enjoyed this video please rate

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what are array list and how we can use array lists in Java now before this we have seen how we can uh declare and use Simple arrays and the problem with those arrays were that we have to provide the initial or the size of the array and the size of the array in those cases were fixed and it's really hard in real programming practices to change the size of the array using simple arrays now Java also provides a library called util and in this util Library there is uh keyword called array list and this array list helps us to uh maintain and use Dynamic arrays so unlike uh the simple arrays whose size is hard to change these uh array lists are dynamically created and used so you can decrease or increase or you know clear uh these array lists whatever you want now to use uh this array list you need to import this util Library so just write import jav Java dot util dot array list and this will add this uh class called array list to your um program and if you want to go inside this class you can can just hover over this and control and click on this and this is the inbuilt Java array list class you can go inside okay now to declare an array list in Java you just need this keyword called array lists so just use this keyword called array list and then in these angular bracket you can give the data type of the array you want to have for example you want to create an integer array we just write integer and then my list is the name of the array not here but it should come outside these angular brackets like this my list is equal to new array list and then once again integer and then here you can give the initial size and this is not the fixed size size this is the initial size you want to provide this size can be changed it can be increased or decreased depending upon your requirement now to add values to the array you just need the variable name and then just write add and in here you can add any value for example at index one we want to add one and in a similar way you can add values one by one here so for example second number is five third is uh three and we will add two more numbers for example 6 and 9 93 whatever okay so now for example I want to access those values I can use Advanced for Loop for iterating over this uh list so what I can do is I can just write integer X and then in here from my list I can iterate these values so in here I can just write CIS or control shift and in here I can just iterate over my list using X okay and once I run the program it just prints all the values of the arrays five values so five uh you know five uh times we can print the values okay now in order to uh get the size of the array you can do something like this so you can just write system.out.print and then the name of your list or array list which is uh my list here and then the do size and this gives you the size of the array okay so this is the function inside our AR list and this gives the size here you can see five to make it more clear I can just say size is equal to and then this plus so that we can see the size it says size is is equal to five okay which is true because array contain 1 2 3 4 five elements so bear in mind this size shows the number of element contained by the array not the initial size we have provided for example we have provided initial size as five but we have only added three values to the array right and now once we run the program it says size is equal to three so this size is not indicating the initial size which is this one but this indicates the number of element contained by the array so we have added only three element then the size will be three Now using uh this array list you can even remove the values for example I have once again five values I will add two more values to the array and these are some more values and for example I want to remove this uh element at index 2 because index of array list also starts from zero so the index uh start from 0 1 2 3 and four so I want to delete the element three which is at index 2 so I can just use use the array my array which is this one and then I can call a method called dot remove and here I can give the index so I want to remove for example here at index 2 the value is 555 and I want to remove this 555 from here so I will just write two index two and then I will just once again print uh this this array after removing the value and I will also see the size what is the size of this array after removing this value so I will run this program and you can see initially our array contains five values and size was five but when we call this method remove to at index 2 then our size becomes four and 555 is removed from the AR from here right you can see here now there is a method called clear by which you can even clear all the values from the array so just my list do clear and then using this clear you can just clear all the values from the array so initially the size of the array was five but when you call this method on your list the size becomes zero right now for example you want to change some value in your array for example I want to change this value one which is at index 0 to 100 I can do this something like this so your array name then set and then it takes two Al two argument one is the index so I want to to change the value at index0 because one is at index 0er and I want to change the value of 1 to 100 so second value is 100 or second argument is 100 and now when I run the program the size remains same but the value here earlier it was one now it became 100 okay so in this way you can use these array list in uh Java it contain many more method for example when I just use this variable name my list and when I just uh use dot separator it will give you suggestions and here it will give you some more suggestions like um you can uh clone this or you can have you can check if this uh array is empty or not or you can check or you can trim this array to the size of something so let's try to trim this list dot trim to size okay and what this method is doing is it trims the size of the array to the number of element it contain for example initial size of this array was five and we have just provided three then it trim your array to three itself in instead of initial size okay so trimming means just cut cutting the size of the array uh to the number of element it contains which is three so in this way you can use many more method on this list but I hope you have enjoyed uh I mean you have learned the basic concept of array list and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye
