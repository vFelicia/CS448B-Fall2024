00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in our proposed video we
00:05 - discuss about what is trend and why we
00:08 - use in this video we implement design
00:11 - the first one is inert ring as I said
00:15 - live in my previous video we use inner
00:19 - join to combine both the tables and it
00:22 - will return the data whenever it will
00:24 - found matches so let us first open the
00:28 - terminal' mysql - you password
00:48 - so databases so we have data test data
00:55 - beans here and we use that so which are
01:05 - the tables had present in our database
01:08 - so we have Department upon and employed
01:12 - by let me first show you vote out the
01:15 - records present in employee table so
01:28 - these are the records the filter ID name
01:33 - and department ID in which they belong
01:38 - department ID bridge n belongs to
01:42 - department ID one Roth belongs to tune
01:45 - it to belongs to three and as on now let
01:50 - us see which are the records present in
01:52 - departmental so here as you can see
01:58 - Department has two film department
02:01 - heading and department the department ID
02:04 - one is for IT department and department
02:07 - ID 2 is called HR d as I told you in my
02:11 - previous video in order to use join
02:14 - there must be a common fill of columns
02:17 - that make a relationship between two
02:19 - tables so as you can see it has
02:23 - department ID here as well as here so we
02:25 - can apply a charm from the top of it so
02:28 - now we want to fetch the data which are
02:36 - common in both the tables it means that
02:40 - we want to face the data we want to face
02:46 - the name of the employees who belongs to
02:48 - either department 1 or departmental we
02:53 - do not own department 3 and department
02:55 - for is they are not listed here so ok
03:00 - I won't ID name now as you can see
03:12 - Department ID present in both the table
03:16 - so if I just write department ID then
03:20 - there will be an ambiguity that this
03:23 - department ID should it consider so we
03:27 - have to provide the table name with the
03:31 - economy so I want department ID from the
03:34 - department table so I write Department
03:38 - thought deep ID and I also want
03:49 - Department name from employee now I
04:00 - specify the join keyword and the name of
04:03 - the under table which is Department from
04:11 - employee during department home now we
04:15 - specify each column says the
04:19 - relationship between two tables in our
04:22 - scenario department ID is common between
04:24 - two tables so we write on employee tote
04:32 - department ID is equal to Department dot
04:41 - divided it means that it was returned t
04:44 - varies whenever it it will match
04:48 - department ID from the employee table
04:50 - and department ID from the department
04:53 - that's it
04:55 - so as you can see it will give us the
05:00 - records which belongs to only IT and HR
05:04 - department it will not find us the
05:06 - result for the third Department default
05:10 - Department because they are not listed
05:12 - in here
05:14 - we can also use we're like condition as
05:18 - we use in our earlier case for just
05:21 - closed is open masterwork back
05:32 - you
05:42 - let's say ID
06:15 - is equal to
06:19 - the apartment dot defining where let's
06:26 - say T by D is equal to one and just five
06:34 - days okay
06:39 - we forgot to select the database use
06:44 - data test okay okay we have to write
06:54 - department dot d ID because there will
07:00 - be an ambiguity because department ID
07:02 - present in both tables okay so as you
07:08 - can see it will give us the records
07:10 - which are which have the department ID
07:13 - is equal to five so in this way you can
07:17 - use inner join to fail data from
07:20 - multiple tables thanks for watching

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our proposed video we discuss about what is trend and why we use in this video we implement design the first one is inert ring as I said live in my previous video we use inner join to combine both the tables and it will return the data whenever it will found matches so let us first open the terminal' mysql you password so databases so we have data test data beans here and we use that so which are the tables had present in our database so we have Department upon and employed by let me first show you vote out the records present in employee table so these are the records the filter ID name and department ID in which they belong department ID bridge n belongs to department ID one Roth belongs to tune it to belongs to three and as on now let us see which are the records present in departmental so here as you can see Department has two film department heading and department the department ID one is for IT department and department ID 2 is called HR d as I told you in my previous video in order to use join there must be a common fill of columns that make a relationship between two tables so as you can see it has department ID here as well as here so we can apply a charm from the top of it so now we want to fetch the data which are common in both the tables it means that we want to face the data we want to face the name of the employees who belongs to either department 1 or departmental we do not own department 3 and department for is they are not listed here so ok I won't ID name now as you can see Department ID present in both the table so if I just write department ID then there will be an ambiguity that this department ID should it consider so we have to provide the table name with the economy so I want department ID from the department table so I write Department thought deep ID and I also want Department name from employee now I specify the join keyword and the name of the under table which is Department from employee during department home now we specify each column says the relationship between two tables in our scenario department ID is common between two tables so we write on employee tote department ID is equal to Department dot divided it means that it was returned t varies whenever it it will match department ID from the employee table and department ID from the department that's it so as you can see it will give us the records which belongs to only IT and HR department it will not find us the result for the third Department default Department because they are not listed in here we can also use we're like condition as we use in our earlier case for just closed is open masterwork back you let's say ID is equal to the apartment dot defining where let's say T by D is equal to one and just five days okay we forgot to select the database use data test okay okay we have to write department dot d ID because there will be an ambiguity because department ID present in both tables okay so as you can see it will give us the records which are which have the department ID is equal to five so in this way you can use inner join to fail data from multiple tables thanks for watching
