00:00 - program you noticed in this video we
00:02 - will see how to use end operator to join
00:05 - multiple condition in our sequel
00:07 - statement so first row to open your
00:09 - terminal write PS q now let us see which
00:18 - are the databases by length in our
00:21 - system so we use test database fortified
00:28 - /c in the name of the database it
00:35 - happens that we are going to use these
00:36 - two on table so let me show you what
00:41 - student table is actually here you can
00:50 - see it has two columns wrong number
00:53 - ending okay so it has 10 rows and if I
01:08 - want to filter it with the zeros and we
01:12 - can find where let's say wrong number is
01:22 - greater than 1 we go so here you can
01:29 - notice one thing that after we're close
01:32 - I provide the conditioned soul number
01:35 - greater than 1 0 axis is the cat aside
01:38 - this is only one condition but in real
01:40 - life in jail scenarios there may have
01:43 - variable condition so if you want to
01:46 - join with a condition which are more
01:49 - than two then you can use end operator
01:53 - we can use like m and specify the
01:59 - another condition let's say row number
02:02 - greater than 0 5 but
02:06 - less than 1 min here you can see that
02:15 - all number is between 1:05 and people 1
02:19 - so this whole condition will be true if
02:23 - both the condition will be true if even
02:29 - one of them is not true then the whole
02:30 - condition becomes false let's say roll
02:38 - number greater than 1 0 fun and next
02:42 - same name is equal to 1 0 5 as the robot
02:50 - name but you okay so both a total number
03:01 - greater than 0 5 and the name is Rover
03:05 - now if I write equal to let say 1 4 5
03:16 - and name then this condition is true but
03:23 - this condition is false so the whole
03:26 - condition becomes false so we will get
03:28 - nothing
03:30 - yeah you can see so let me just close
03:35 - the terminal and open me test at events
03:42 - and dick wet - so these select name
04:05 - then don't know mom better then one so
04:18 - you can see what the condition satisfied
04:20 - it that's why the whole bunny center
04:22 - comes through and we get the result if
04:25 - one of them will be formed so let's say
04:30 - then we get nothing so this is how we
04:36 - can join multiple condition with the end
04:38 - operator
04:39 - thanks for watching

program you noticed in this video we will see how to use end operator to join multiple condition in our sequel statement so first row to open your terminal write PS q now let us see which are the databases by length in our system so we use test database fortified /c in the name of the database it happens that we are going to use these two on table so let me show you what student table is actually here you can see it has two columns wrong number ending okay so it has 10 rows and if I want to filter it with the zeros and we can find where let's say wrong number is greater than 1 we go so here you can notice one thing that after we're close I provide the conditioned soul number greater than 1 0 axis is the cat aside this is only one condition but in real life in jail scenarios there may have variable condition so if you want to join with a condition which are more than two then you can use end operator we can use like m and specify the another condition let's say row number greater than 0 5 but less than 1 min here you can see that all number is between 105 and people 1 so this whole condition will be true if both the condition will be true if even one of them is not true then the whole condition becomes false let's say roll number greater than 1 0 fun and next same name is equal to 1 0 5 as the robot name but you okay so both a total number greater than 0 5 and the name is Rover now if I write equal to let say 1 4 5 and name then this condition is true but this condition is false so the whole condition becomes false so we will get nothing yeah you can see so let me just close the terminal and open me test at events and dick wet so these select name then don't know mom better then one so you can see what the condition satisfied it that's why the whole bunny center comes through and we get the result if one of them will be formed so let's say then we get nothing so this is how we can join multiple condition with the end operator thanks for watching
