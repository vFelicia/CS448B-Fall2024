00:01 - hello guys from this video I'm starting
00:03 - a new video series on WPF application
00:06 - using
00:08 - C so first question comes into mind is
00:13 - till now we have been uh seeing or I
00:16 - have been showing you how to make
00:19 - Windows Form application using cop and
00:22 - why do we need WPF uh application using
00:27 - C
00:28 - so Windows Form application when we
00:33 - see like this and when I run it it takes
00:39 - the styling and the appearance of the
00:44 - windows version you are running for
00:47 - example I'm running Windows 7 so it
00:49 - takes the look and feel of Windows 7
00:54 - window but some application requires uh
00:59 - design design designing their own
01:03 - design right so for achieving that goal
01:08 - we use Windows Form application of
01:11 - course there are all other um
01:16 - application of all other advantage of
01:18 - using Windows Form application and as
01:22 - well as advantage of using WPF
01:27 - application so if you want want to learn
01:31 - more about what is the difference
01:34 - between Windows Form application and
01:39 - uh WPF then you can always Google it and
01:44 - I come across the first link which is
01:47 - from Microsoft and somebody answered the
01:51 - question WPF versus Windows Form
01:55 - application and when I click it you can
01:58 - see the nice explanation he has given
02:03 - what is the difference between or what
02:05 - is the uh why they are used but this
02:11 - answer is uh I mean given in was given
02:16 - in
02:17 - 2007 so till now Windows Form
02:21 - application and WPF also have been
02:25 - evolved a lot so you can always go and
02:30 - read this uh difference between them and
02:34 - decide what suits your
02:37 - application so
02:39 - now too much talking and now we are
02:42 - going to make our
02:45 - first program so go to file new
02:49 - project and go to visual cop and we will
02:52 - choose WPF
02:54 - application and I will call my
02:57 - application as WPF
03:00 - app
03:02 - one and I will click
03:06 - okay
03:08 - and one thing you will notice is it's
03:12 - the design or the appearance of this
03:16 - form is not as the form which we have
03:21 - generated in Windows Form right so it's
03:24 - a little bit different I will just make
03:26 - it little bit bigger so you can see so
03:29 - it generates this form in which we can
03:34 - design our application View and it also
03:38 - generate this XL file which in which we
03:44 - can write the code for Designing this uh
03:49 - form so let's see how this changes when
03:54 - you design something so what I will do
03:58 - is first of all I I will make it a
04:00 - little bit smaller so you can see here
04:04 - and here is also one good feature you
04:08 - can always make it bigger
04:11 - by sliding this
04:14 - slider okay so now I will take a button
04:17 - From
04:18 - Here and Now for example I want to
04:21 - change the properties so what kind can I
04:24 - do is I will just click this button and
04:28 - go to the properties right here or I can
04:32 - change it from here also so when I drag
04:35 - and drop a button in the grid tag it has
04:40 - generated this code automatically so the
04:44 - content or the caption of this button is
04:48 - button and uh it has horizontal
04:52 - alignment on margin and all all the
04:55 - properties are generated in this XL file
04:59 - right so you can change it from here
05:02 - also and you can CH go to the properties
05:04 - and change it from here also so let's
05:07 - try and change first the content content
05:10 - is the caption so for
05:12 - example test I write as a content and
05:19 - here it changes
05:21 - here
05:23 - now for example I want to change the
05:25 - name I can go here in the button
05:30 - code this code is for the button and I
05:33 - can change the name so I can give the
05:36 - name as
05:40 - BTN 1 for
05:43 - example and see here when I change the
05:48 - width the width also width and height
05:51 - also changes here so whatever you change
05:54 - here it will be affected here and
05:57 - whatever change you make here here it
06:00 - will be affected here so both are
06:04 - changed if you make changes in
06:07 - one file or one
06:10 - one
06:13 - perspective so now we want to do
06:18 - something with this test button so I
06:20 - will double click it you can always go
06:23 - to the
06:24 - event
06:26 - and go come here from going to the event
06:30 - I will show you that also so I double
06:32 - click the button and for example I want
06:35 - to show the message so I will write
06:37 - message it's just like
06:41 - uh
06:43 - using the Windows Form application there
06:46 - also we write message box
06:49 - dot
06:51 - show and
06:55 - here is
06:58 - the
07:02 - first app for
07:04 - example and test first step test okay so
07:11 - I will make it bigger so you can see it
07:14 - so I have written this code now I can
07:18 - just hit this green button start
07:23 - debugging and it opens this form so you
07:27 - can see it's the appearance is
07:29 - totally white and when I click this
07:32 - button it shows me the message box right
07:37 - here so this was the first application
07:40 - you generated from your WPF application
07:45 - you can always change this properties of
07:47 - this button or this form by going to the
07:51 - properties or from here
07:53 - also so just click it and for example I
07:58 - want to
08:00 - change you can change the
08:03 - layout from here you can change the
08:06 - visibility from
08:08 - here
08:10 - and brush from here so for now I want to
08:14 - change the foreground and background for
08:16 - example background black is okay for me
08:21 - and foreground black is okay for me and
08:24 - background for example I want to change
08:28 - it a
08:33 - little
08:35 - green okay so it changes this
08:39 - color and when I run this now it looks
08:45 - green so you
08:48 - can select and see all the properties
08:52 - from here how the
08:54 - changes you can always play with these
08:57 - properties and see what changes occurs
09:01 - here so this was the first video on WPF
09:05 - application in the future I will also
09:08 - make some other videos and
09:11 - probably I'm going to make
09:14 - uh simple project so if with each video
09:20 - we will develop a project and you will
09:23 - be able to learn more so I hope you have
09:26 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
09:28 - and subscribe and by for now

hello guys from this video I'm starting a new video series on WPF application using C so first question comes into mind is till now we have been uh seeing or I have been showing you how to make Windows Form application using cop and why do we need WPF uh application using C so Windows Form application when we see like this and when I run it it takes the styling and the appearance of the windows version you are running for example I'm running Windows 7 so it takes the look and feel of Windows 7 window but some application requires uh design design designing their own design right so for achieving that goal we use Windows Form application of course there are all other um application of all other advantage of using Windows Form application and as well as advantage of using WPF application so if you want want to learn more about what is the difference between Windows Form application and uh WPF then you can always Google it and I come across the first link which is from Microsoft and somebody answered the question WPF versus Windows Form application and when I click it you can see the nice explanation he has given what is the difference between or what is the uh why they are used but this answer is uh I mean given in was given in 2007 so till now Windows Form application and WPF also have been evolved a lot so you can always go and read this uh difference between them and decide what suits your application so now too much talking and now we are going to make our first program so go to file new project and go to visual cop and we will choose WPF application and I will call my application as WPF app one and I will click okay and one thing you will notice is it's the design or the appearance of this form is not as the form which we have generated in Windows

changes here now for example I want to change the name I can go here in the button code this code is for the button and I can change the name so I can give the name as BTN 1 for example and see here when I change the width the width also width and height also changes here so whatever you change here it will be affected here and whatever change you make here here it will be affected here so both are changed if you make changes in one file or one one perspective so now we want to do something with this test button so I will double click it you can always go to the event and go come here from going to the event I will show you that also so I double click the button and for example I want to show the message so I will write message it's just like uh using the Windows Form application there
