05:42 - and then i'm going to select groovy from
05:45 - here
05:46 - on the top you can see project sdk
05:49 - so because i have already pre-installed
05:52 - java jdk 17 on my windows 11 operating

07:07 - let me maximize this window here
07:10 - now
07:11 - here
07:12 - you can see there is this new feature

07:46 - created for me
07:48 - and
07:49 - now inside this class i can create a
