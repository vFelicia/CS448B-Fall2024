With timestamps:

00:00 - so here i have started my real server
00:02 - and here i've started my rails console
00:04 - so let's make a post dot connection
00:07 - post.connection
00:09 - and then yeah then we it's fine
00:12 - then we can type post and we could see
00:15 - our database
00:15 - like schema so here is our database
00:18 - schema here you can see
00:19 - so here we can work on this schema and
00:21 - let's get started
00:22 - so basically uh i'll run my application
00:25 - so yeah this is application let's add it
00:27 - to do
00:29 - new uh let's give them some like task
00:32 - one and just for the simplicity let's
00:36 - add this
00:37 - yeah perfect task two
00:41 - so with the simplicity i am going to
00:43 - repeat this process like for a few tasks
00:46 - last three yeah so
00:49 - here you can see that it is we have
00:52 - created three tasks works perfectly fine
00:55 - but when we click on this
00:56 - none of them is get gets deleted so
00:59 - we've been implemented delete
01:00 - functionality
01:01 - the first thing we need to do you need
01:02 - to move to this file uh
01:05 - index.html.erb and you need to convert
01:07 - this
01:08 - button to delete okay so
01:12 - first let's make it out or delete so
01:15 - let's move to this file
01:16 - uh we will move to roush.erp
01:21 - and let's create this delete
01:24 - let's create delete and for that we need
01:27 - an id
01:29 - so this is not a get method this is a
01:31 - delete method
01:33 - okay uh we go to
01:36 - root hash
01:39 - delete i hope this is fine so
01:42 - let's move to root hat delete so this is
01:45 - where we
01:46 - form the delete operation now let's
01:50 - move to our root controller and create a
01:52 - method delete
01:54 - and simply let's end this
01:59 - and render json
02:04 - params okay this is fine we have made
02:08 - this
02:08 - let's move to index.html.erb
02:11 - and let's change this button to btn btn
02:15 - danger and we have changed this to beat
02:20 - in bd and dangerous y because it will
02:21 - give a red feather and
02:22 - give let's give it give it a style also
02:25 - so we'll move the style
02:26 - is equal to display display
02:30 - or simply give margin 0 it will move to
02:34 - center
02:36 - okay uh yeah so we can refresh this
02:42 - so it gives an error so let me check
02:46 - extracted source around
02:49 - let me check what this error is throwing
02:51 - let me check
02:52 - please welcome back uh
02:55 - the error is like we need to check that
02:58 - i need to put a
02:58 - colon sign here so this was fine let's
03:01 - refresh this
03:02 - and no match for get add okay okay
03:06 - this is something yeah so here we have
03:08 - move to the delete button
03:10 - so now let's click on this
03:13 - and this is not working
03:17 - okay so there's seen some issue with
03:19 - this so
03:20 - this is not working let me let the we
03:23 - have created delete route
03:25 - and let's move to index.html.erb
03:30 - yeah because it won't work because there
03:32 - is no hrm
03:34 - so when we say hrf is equal to slash
03:36 - delete
03:38 - and we need to define
03:41 - we need to put the like we need to put
03:44 - the id
03:45 - basically we need the id so we will
03:48 - direct find post
03:49 - dot id then we will close this
03:52 - and now this is fine so basically what
03:55 - we do
03:55 - we call for a delete method and with the
03:58 - id we pass it here another thing we need
04:00 - to do we need to price data method
04:02 - is equal to delete because by default
04:06 - a anchor tag has a get nature so nature
04:09 - won't work here because yeah i can uh
04:13 - opt for this i will show you how first
04:16 - i'll refresh
04:19 - now here you can see now i'll call this
04:20 - so it says get
04:22 - delete nine is not possible yes it won't
04:24 - be possible because
04:25 - we had defined in a route short rb this
04:27 - was a delete method
04:28 - so let's move back to index.html.erb
04:32 - and make this data method from the third
04:35 - is equal to this could be either get
04:38 - either post
04:41 - uh either get post or delete so we make
04:43 - it delete
04:44 - let's move this so let's
04:48 - let's move to our app refresh it
04:51 - so let's call delete and here you can
04:53 - see we have a json response so it works
04:55 - perfectly fine
04:56 - what we need to do we need to move to
04:57 - root controller now
04:59 - and we will do at the post is able to
05:02 - post
05:04 - post dot find
05:07 - patterns of id
05:10 - okay so because we need to match with
05:13 - the id
05:14 - here and we will simply say
05:17 - it did it post or destroy
05:20 - destroy and this would delete the post
05:22 - and everything else remains same
05:24 - instead of generate json response we
05:27 - render
05:28 - at the rate possible and render index
05:31 - because then we this is a single post
05:34 - this is all the post so let's
05:35 - refresh this let's check if this is
05:38 - working or not
05:39 - yeah so refresh the app let's create
05:41 - delete
05:43 - okay still it returns like json response
05:49 - okay let me check what's issue
05:53 - yeah so now i have saved the file i must
05:56 - have forgot to save this
05:58 - now click on delete yeah now it works
06:00 - everything works fine
06:01 - because i forgot to save the file so
06:03 - change these changes won't save so
06:05 - it was like until json so now after uh
06:08 - saving them the saving the file now
06:10 - reflects the changes
06:11 - so let's quickly check whether how to do
06:13 - this now
06:14 - to do one let's create a description to
06:17 - do one
06:18 - now do do let's create
06:22 - now delete both of them dated deleted
06:25 - so perfectly fine so this is how we
06:28 - get the delete functionality so
06:32 - let's create another functionality let's
06:34 - create uh
06:36 - let's create some to do to do one
06:40 - and let's create this two to one
06:45 - to do two
06:49 - let's click ask three
06:52 - let's let's create some to do's now
06:54 - because we
06:55 - we might need to implement a new
06:57 - functionality and we might need them
07:00 - so let's do this so task so let's
07:04 - tell me to do let's create this
07:07 - as well okay so we have five to do's
07:10 - here
07:11 - and we can delete one
07:14 - okay just for so we deleted this so
07:17 - perfectly fine
07:18 - so let's create a search functionality
07:20 - for search functionality to be created
07:23 - we need to write a query sql query
07:27 - so let's write post dot where
07:31 - where post dot title
07:37 - like and this is a
07:41 - sql operator like so question mark will
07:44 - the question mark just like to take the
07:45 - value so what value we want here we want
07:47 - a value
07:48 - which is inside this okay so
07:52 - first what i'll do uh i'll type here so
07:55 - it says select post dot star from
07:59 - because i didn't pass anything in this
08:00 - in this array so
08:02 - that's absolutely fine uh let's do post
08:04 - dot all
08:08 - so we get all of them so now let's do
08:10 - something
08:11 - let's take a variable query and make is
08:15 - our dummy
08:17 - okay and now let's write this query
08:20 - where
08:22 - where we are defining now
08:25 - where we need to define a percent
08:28 - operator
08:29 - and this is like a query this will take
08:32 - the value
08:33 - and this is now we again put a person
08:37 - operator
08:38 - and type this so so here it says select
08:42 - post dot from post your post or title
08:44 - like dummy so this return this to do
08:46 - perfectly fine so this is the query
08:49 - value we had put in
08:50 - so this is so it's perfectly working
08:52 - fine so we can copy this query
08:55 - i had posted i had wrote the same query
08:58 - here as well
08:59 - so let's move here and type define
09:01 - search
09:06 - search let's create this end
09:11 - so and we need to define them as
09:15 - address post and
09:19 - yes this is fine and we need to refine
09:21 - the render index
09:23 - uh now the only one thing is left we
09:26 - need to get the query
09:28 - okay and the query would be our params
09:31 - of query okay
09:35 - so from where we will get this query so
09:37 - let's implement this
09:39 - uh in our header so move to let's move
09:42 - to our header
09:44 - and here we have this input type
09:47 - is equal to search this is a search form
09:49 - which refers to this at the top right
09:52 - so what we can do we can define
09:56 - we can define name is equal to query
09:58 - because we would are going to take and
10:00 - method
10:01 - is equal to get so by default it is get
10:07 - so let's refresh and
10:10 - this is some we can ignore this
10:14 - so let's type hello let's type dummy
10:19 - dummy and let's click on search
10:26 - so we forgot to like make a request
10:30 - get slash search
10:34 - and which says to
10:37 - is equal to root hash search
10:42 - so this is what error and now we need to
10:45 - put this
10:46 - inside an action okay so we would move
10:49 - to our header.html.drp
10:51 - and we need to put this inside an
10:54 - action so basically this name
10:58 - this method should we get
11:02 - this at wrong place so this is get an
11:04 - action is equal to search
11:11 - so i hope it should work now
11:14 - so let's type dummy and let's hit the
11:17 - button
11:18 - so yeah so undefined low color with
11:21 - variable method query
11:23 - okay so it's like a small error
11:26 - i figured out and we needed to find the
11:28 - root controller and this should be added
11:30 - query
11:33 - let's refresh this and here you can see
11:35 - the dummy has been searched successfully
11:37 - let's type to do and let's search it
11:40 - get many tools dummy to do and to do
11:42 - because both of them have a tool
11:43 - keyword so this is how we operate the
11:46 - search operation
11:47 - thank you everyone for watching this
11:48 - tutorial i'll catch you in the next one
11:50 - thank you
12:01 - and

Cleaned transcript:

so here i have started my real server and here i've started my rails console so let's make a post dot connection post.connection and then yeah then we it's fine then we can type post and we could see

can see the dummy has been searched successfully let's type to do and let's search it get many tools dummy to do and to do because both of them have a tool keyword so this is how we operate the search operation thank you everyone for watching this tutorial i'll catch you in the next one thank you and
