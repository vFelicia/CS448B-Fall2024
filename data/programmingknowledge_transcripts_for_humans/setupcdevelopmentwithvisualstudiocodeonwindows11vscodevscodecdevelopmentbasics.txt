00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set up c and c plus plus
00:04 - support on your visual studio code
00:06 - editor on your windows 11 operating
00:09 - system
00:10 - so for this
00:11 - you will need two things
00:13 - first one is obvious which is visual
00:15 - studio code
00:17 - so if you haven't installed visual
00:19 - studio code i will recommend you to
00:21 - install it it's a very
00:23 - easy and simple process and if you don't
00:25 - know how to install visual studio code i
00:27 - will put the link of the video in which
00:29 - i have shown how you can install and use
00:31 - visual studio code
00:33 - and once you have visual studio code we
00:36 - need a second tool which is called a
00:39 - compiler right so a compiler will help
00:43 - you to compile
00:44 - your cnc plus plus code on any operating
00:47 - system
00:48 - so for windows we are going to install
00:51 - the mingw compiler so let's start with
00:54 - that so first of all open your favorite
00:56 - browser and search for bin gw and in the
00:59 - search result you will see some websites
01:02 - so don't click on the first website
01:04 - which you will see here which is from
01:07 - sourceforge
01:08 - you need to open this website which says
01:11 - mingw iphone
01:15 - w64.org so just click on this link which
01:18 - says mingw hyphen w64.org
01:22 - and once this website opens you will be
01:25 - able to see the overview here and on
01:28 - this website you can click on the
01:29 - downloads
01:31 - link here
01:32 - so here you will be able to see all the
01:35 - download link for bing w for different
01:38 - operating systems so the one we are
01:40 - looking for is the windows version so we
01:42 - are going to click on
01:44 - this link which says mingw w64 builds so
01:48 - just click on this link which is going
01:50 - to open
01:51 - this kind of window again and from here
01:54 - you can download the mingw builds from
01:57 - sourceforge so you need to click on this
01:59 - link now right
02:02 - so sourceforge link was uh shown
02:04 - directly in the search result but you
02:06 - need to go through this website in order
02:09 - to come to this website and once you are
02:12 - redirected to the sourceforge.net
02:14 - website you will see that min gw 64-bit
02:18 - installer exe file will be downloaded on
02:21 - your windows 11 operating system so once
02:24 - this file is downloaded i'm going to
02:26 - click on this file
02:28 - and then you will see this warning which
02:30 - says do you want to allow this app
02:32 - from unknown publisher to make changes
02:35 - on your device i trust this so i will
02:37 - click on yes here
02:39 - and i'm going to minimize this browser
02:42 - and you can see mingw installer has been
02:45 - started on my windows 11 operating
02:47 - system so on the first window i just
02:50 - need to click on next here which is
02:52 - going to
02:53 - start the installation
02:55 - here you can choose the version for
02:58 - mingw so i'm going to choose the topmost
03:02 - option which is 8.1.3 at the time of
03:04 - making this video you can also choose
03:06 - the architecture i'm going to choose x
03:09 - 8664
03:11 - and then you can choose the
03:13 - threads so generally for threads i
03:15 - always choose 6 but you can also choose
03:18 - win32 also
03:20 - also exception you have two options i
03:23 - will leave it as default and then you
03:26 - have the build revision i will leave it
03:28 - as default also and then click on next
03:32 - and this will be the location where
03:34 - your mingw compiler will be installed so
03:37 - you can see
03:39 - it will be installed in
03:41 - the program files min gw directory will
03:45 - be created and then
03:46 - this folder will be created right
03:50 - so if you don't have the good reason to
03:51 - change this location just leave it as
03:53 - default and also you can leave this
03:55 - checkbox as checked which is going to
03:58 - create a shortcut for your mingw uh
04:01 - compiler tool so i'm going to click on
04:03 - next now which is going to start the
04:05 - download of all the files and packages
04:08 - for your mingw tools
04:11 - so just wait for this process to reach
04:13 - to the 100 mark so now after some time i
04:16 - can see this window which says click
04:18 - next to continue the installation so i'm
04:20 - going to click on the next
04:22 - and now i can see this message which
04:24 - says mingw has been successfully
04:26 - installed and i can click on finish to
04:29 - complete the installation so let me
04:31 - click on the finish button so once i
04:34 - click on the finish button
04:36 - mingw is installed on my windows
04:38 - operating systems so now once mingw is
04:41 - installed first of all we need to know
04:44 - the location where mingw is installed
04:47 - so at the time of installation you might
04:48 - have noted the location so let me show
04:51 - you the default location where mingw
04:53 - will be installed so you need to go
04:56 - inside the c directory and then go
04:58 - inside
05:00 - program files and then you will be able
05:02 - to see this mingw hyphen w 64 bit folder
05:07 - here and then this folder will be there
05:11 - so this is the location where mingw is
05:14 - installed
05:15 - then you need to go inside mingw64
05:18 - and here
05:20 - under the bin folder you will see all
05:23 - the files which will help you to compile
05:25 - your c or c plus programs okay
05:28 - so go until the bin folder right
05:32 - and you need to copy this path now we
05:34 - need to set the environment variable for
05:36 - mingw so that we can
05:39 - use gcc or g plus plus command on our
05:42 - windows command prompt or powershell or
05:45 - terminal
05:46 - so for that what you need to do you just
05:48 - need to click on search and then search
05:51 - for edit
05:53 - env and it's going to show you this
05:54 - result which says edit environment
05:56 - variables for your account and you can
05:59 - see this window is going to open right
06:02 - now if you
06:04 - can't find this edit environment
06:06 - variable window using the search option
06:09 - then you can always open the control
06:11 - panel
06:12 - and then once control panel opens you
06:15 - need to view by category here and then
06:17 - click on system and security and then
06:19 - once again click on system here which is
06:21 - going to open the settings app and here
06:24 - it's going to show you an about section
06:28 - this link which says advanced system
06:30 - settings
06:31 - so just click on that and then click on
06:34 - environment variables which is also
06:35 - going to
06:36 - open the same window so you can choose
06:39 - any one of the method so once this
06:42 - environment variables window opens
06:44 - select path under system variables and
06:47 - then click on edit
06:49 - and then click on new here okay
06:51 - so it's going to allow you to
06:54 - add a new environment variable
06:56 - and then just copy
06:58 - the path
07:00 - until the bin folder inside your mingw
07:04 - 64 bit folder okay so this path is until
07:08 - bin folder okay
07:10 - and once you copied it you can
07:12 - just
07:13 - add this path here
07:15 - inside your environment variable and
07:18 - then just press enter which is going to
07:20 - add your path and then click ok here and
07:23 - then click ok
07:25 - and then once again click on ok
07:27 - and now you can close all the windows
07:29 - here
07:30 - and now we can test our gcc and g plus
07:34 - plus
07:35 - versions and commands right
07:37 - so you can open the command prompt by
07:40 - just pressing cmd
07:42 - and then open the command prompt from
07:44 - the result and once the command prompt
07:47 - is open here you can just write gcc
07:50 - space hyphen hyphen
07:53 - version and then press enter and if you
07:55 - see some result which looks like this
07:57 - that means gcc command is working
08:00 - successfully on your windows 11
08:03 - operating system similarly you can also
08:05 - check the g plus plus command which is
08:07 - also used to compile your c plus plus
08:08 - programs so it's also going to show you
08:11 - this kind of result here so once you see
08:14 - this kind of result that means your gcc
08:16 - and g plus plus commands are working so
08:18 - once you have installed the min gw
08:20 - compiler and you have set the
08:22 - environment variables for gcc and g plus
08:25 - plus
08:26 - we are ready to create our first c plus
08:29 - plus code so let's start with the very
08:32 - basics
08:33 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:35 - open my
08:37 - command prompt so for that i'm going to
08:40 - just search for cmd and then press enter
08:42 - which is going to open my command prompt
08:44 - and then let's say i'm going to create a
08:48 - folder in which i want to
08:50 - have all my c plus related files right
08:55 - so let's say i want to create this
08:57 - folder on my desktop
08:59 - i'm going to just cd to my desktop first
09:02 - of all
09:03 - and then i'm going to create a folder
09:06 - and on command prompt to create a folder
09:08 - you can give this command mkdir and then
09:11 - let's say i want to name my folder as
09:14 - my cpp app
09:17 - and then i'm going to just press enter
09:19 - which is going to create the folder with
09:21 - this name you can also right click here
09:24 - and then create the folder
09:26 - uh if you want you don't need to create
09:30 - it with the help of command prompt
09:32 - so once
09:33 - this folder is created i'm going to cd
09:35 - in this folder
09:37 - and then
09:38 - when i type on the command prompt code
09:41 - space dot
09:43 - and then press enter it's going to open
09:45 - visual studio code
09:47 - and
09:48 - this folder will be opened in visual
09:51 - studio code from which i have given this
09:54 - command right so currently i am in
09:57 - my cpp app folder in the command prompt
10:00 - right and when i gave this command it's
10:03 - going to open this folder
10:06 - in visual studio code
10:08 - here i can create
10:10 - a cpp file so let's create a very basic
10:14 - c plus file i'm going to name my file as
10:17 - main dot cpp here and then press enter
10:20 - which is going to create this file now
10:23 - as soon as i create the c plus plus file
10:26 - visual studio code is going to recognize
10:28 - that and it's going to show me some
10:30 - recommendations you can see
10:32 - do you want to install recommended
10:34 - extension for c plus plus
10:37 - so here you can click on this option
10:40 - don't click on install but because we
10:42 - want to see which extensions we are
10:44 - going to install so i'm going to click
10:47 - on show recommendations here
10:49 - and here it's going to open this
10:52 - extensions
10:54 - tab right so on the left hand side you
10:57 - have this bar and
10:59 - when you just hover over this extensions
11:02 - icon here
11:03 - you will be able to see
11:05 - that it's for extension so just click on
11:07 - this
11:08 - and then
11:09 - you will be able to
11:11 - see many extensions
11:13 - for cnc plus plus right
11:16 - so right now the recommended extension
11:18 - by visual studio code for us is this one
11:22 - which is
11:23 - created by microsoft you can see
11:26 - and the number of downloads are also
11:30 - given here so around 3.3 million
11:32 - downloads are done for this extension
11:36 - so
11:37 - if you
11:38 - don't see this recommendation you can
11:41 - always go to this extensions
11:44 - tab here and then search for c plus plus
11:48 - and
11:48 - once you search for c plus it's going to
11:51 - show you uh all these recommendations
11:53 - right
11:54 - so the first the topmost option
11:57 - is going to be the option which you will
12:01 - require so you can see
12:03 - this one and it's from microsoft once
12:05 - again and for this extension you can see
12:07 - the number of downloads are 27 million
12:10 - and what it does it provides the support
12:13 - for c and c plus intellisense debugging
12:16 - and code browsing so we are going to
12:19 - install the c
12:20 - c plus plus extension first of all
12:23 - and just click on the install button
12:25 - which is going to start the installation
12:27 - process of this extension
12:29 - same we are going to do for
12:32 - this one
12:33 - which is called c
12:36 - slash c plus plus extension pack so just
12:39 - uh choose this uh extension also which
12:42 - is called c slash c plus plus extension
12:45 - pack and then click on install which is
12:48 - going to install
12:50 - nine essential c and c plus plus related
12:54 - packs right so we have already installed
12:57 - the cnc plus plus intellisense debugging
13:00 - and code browsing extension
13:02 - in addition it's going to install all
13:04 - these extensions so that we can run our
13:08 - c or c plus plus code on visual studio
13:11 - code editor right
13:13 - so if you want to use c make or make or
13:16 - any other
13:18 - kind of tool
13:20 - to build your c plus plus program this
13:23 - extension is going to install all the
13:26 - related extensions for that so you can
13:30 - see all the extensions
13:32 - in this pack are installed
13:34 - and now you will be able to see disable
13:36 - and uninstall
13:38 - option and let's write some code so
13:40 - first of all we are going to include
13:42 - this iostream package so i'm going to
13:44 - just write include and you can see at
13:48 - every point you will get the
13:50 - installations to complete your code so
13:53 - when i just type this angle bracket it
13:56 - shows me all the options and then
13:58 - when i just type io i can see all these
14:02 - packages which starts from i o right i
14:05 - need this i o stream so i'm going to
14:07 - select this and it's going to just add
14:10 - the ending angle bracket also
14:14 - then i'm going to create the main method
14:16 - which is simple int
14:19 - main and then these parentheses
14:22 - and then these curly brackets
14:25 - here i just want to let's say print
14:28 - hello world so i'm going to just write
14:30 - std
14:32 - colon colon c
14:34 - out
14:35 - and then
14:37 - i want to print hello world so once you
14:39 - have written your code you can save your
14:41 - code by just pressing ctrl s which is
14:44 - going to save your code
14:46 - and then
14:48 - you are ready to run your code so how
14:50 - you can run your code on your visual
14:53 - studio code editor
14:54 - so in order to run your code you have
14:57 - the option to
14:58 - open the terminal and run your code
15:00 - there
15:01 - or you can just select this terminal
15:04 - option
15:05 - and you have this run task run build
15:08 - task so i'm going to select this option
15:10 - which says run build task you can also
15:13 - press ctrl shift b for running this
15:16 - build task so let me just click on this
15:19 - and as soon as i click on this option i
15:22 - will see all these options here so for
15:24 - building my c plus program i will
15:26 - require g plus plus dot exe file right
15:30 - if you need to compile the c program so
15:33 - if this file name was main dot c file
15:36 - and you wanted to compile the c program
15:39 - you could have chosen gcc dot exc right
15:43 - so for c plus we use g plus plus and for
15:47 - c programs we use gcc so in my case i'm
15:51 - going to use this option which says g
15:54 - plus plus exe build active file
15:57 - and what it's going to do it's going to
15:59 - build my file and you can see build
16:01 - finished successfully so my build was
16:05 - finished successfully and you can see
16:07 - this main.exe file is generated so now i
16:11 - just need to run this exe file and see
16:14 - what is the output right so for this i
16:16 - can open a new terminal you can open the
16:19 - new terminal by just selecting this
16:21 - terminal option and then click on new
16:23 - terminal or you can click on this plus
16:25 - button which is going to open the new
16:27 - terminal
16:28 - now as you can see
16:30 - the type of terminal which is opened
16:32 - right so
16:34 - by default because powershell is the
16:37 - default terminal on my windows 11
16:40 - operating system so it has opened
16:42 - powershell but let's say i want to open
16:44 - the normal command prompt right i can
16:47 - open it by just clicking on this arrow
16:49 - button and then i can select command
16:51 - prompt from here and it's going to open
16:54 - the command prompt you can
16:55 - see which type of terminal or command
16:58 - prompt is open
16:59 - on the right hand side in this list so
17:03 - i have this power shell terminal open i
17:05 - have this command prompt terminal open
17:08 - and it's similar to opening your cmd
17:12 - on your windows operating system or
17:15 - power shell on your windows operating
17:18 - system so you can see this windows
17:20 - powershell so it's similar to opening
17:23 - uh these uh powershell or command prompt
17:25 - on
17:26 - your windows 11 operating system they
17:29 - are just opened in your visual studio
17:32 - code so they come integrated with your
17:35 - visual studio code
17:37 - from here
17:38 - i select cmd option so
17:41 - i want to
17:43 - run my exe file using command prompt so
17:46 - i can just type the name of my
17:48 - exe file which is main dot exe
17:51 - and then press enter which is going to
17:53 - print the output here which is hello
17:55 - world in my case right so that's how you
17:58 - can run your program
18:00 - using powershell so if you want to use
18:03 - powershell so for the powershell you
18:05 - just need to write dot and then the
18:07 - backslash and the name of your exe which
18:10 - is main
18:11 - dot exe file and then press enter which
18:14 - is also going to show you the hello
18:17 - world result
18:18 - so you can run your exe file using
18:20 - command prompt also and
18:23 - from the powershell also now let me add
18:25 - some more code and i will show you how
18:28 - you can debug your c plus plus program
18:31 - on visual studio code so very simple
18:33 - nothing complicated about this program i
18:36 - just want to show how you can debug
18:38 - your c plus code
18:40 - so in order to debug your c plus plus
18:42 - code you uh select this option which is
18:46 - called run and debug
18:49 - and here
18:50 - you can see a few options so you can
18:54 - click on run and debug button here which
18:56 - is going to run your program in a
18:58 - debugger you can also create a
19:01 - launch.json file to customize uh your
19:04 - debugging options right
19:07 - so for now what i'm going to do i'm
19:09 - going to just add a few uh break points
19:12 - here
19:13 - and
19:14 - you will see the list of all the
19:16 - breakpoints in this list under
19:18 - breakpoint so so you will be able to see
19:20 - the list of all the break points you can
19:23 - see it's in the main.cpp file and then
19:25 - they are at line four five and six right
19:29 - you can disable all the breakpoints by
19:32 - just pressing this button which says
19:34 - toggle active breakpoints and it's going
19:37 - to disable all these break points it's
19:39 - not going to remove the break points but
19:41 - these break points will be disabled
19:44 - you can also remove all these break
19:47 - points by just pressing this option
19:50 - which says remove all breakpoints and
19:51 - it's going to remove all the breakpoints
19:53 - so let me add these breakpoints once
19:55 - again
19:56 - and let's
19:57 - run this debugger so i'm going to click
20:00 - on run and debug button
20:02 - and once again
20:04 - visual studio code is going to ask us
20:07 - which debugger we want to use right so
20:09 - depending upon
20:11 - the debugger available on your windows
20:14 - 11 operating system you can choose from
20:17 - those debuggers because we have
20:19 - installed the min gw as a compiler on
20:22 - our windows operating system we are
20:24 - going to choose the first option which
20:25 - is c plus plus gdb lldb okay so i'm
20:30 - going to select this option
20:32 - and this is going to uh give me once
20:35 - again
20:36 - these options right
20:38 - so now uh as i said
20:41 - for c plus plus programs you choose the
20:43 - g plus plus dot exe file and for c
20:46 - programs you can choose gcc
20:49 - dot exe files right so i'm going to
20:51 - select the g plus plus dot exe file for
20:55 - c plus plus
20:56 - and it's going to run my program in the
20:59 - debugger
21:01 - and you can see it's starting the
21:03 - debugger here and now my program is
21:06 - running in the debug mode so how can i
21:08 - understand that my program is in debug
21:11 - mode you will be able to see this
21:13 - specific color for debugging right so
21:16 - this bar color is changed
21:18 - for the debugging
21:20 - and you will be able to see all these
21:22 - options for debugging so from this
21:25 - option you can continue to uh the next
21:28 - code
21:29 - and then using this you can step over
21:32 - in the code and then you can step into
21:36 - the code
21:37 - and then step out of the code and then
21:40 - you can rerun your debugging once again
21:43 - and you can stop your debugging using
21:46 - this icon
21:47 - now because we have added this
21:49 - breakpoint our program execution is
21:51 - stopped at this line 4 which is our
21:55 - first breakpoint
21:56 - and on the left hand side you will be
21:58 - able to see
22:00 - the list of all variables and the values
22:04 - for these variables so right now
22:07 - the variable 1 have zero value variable
22:10 - to have 16 and variable
22:13 - sum has zero value because at this point
22:16 - these numbers are not assigned to our
22:19 - variables
22:21 - c plus plus is going to assign the
22:22 - random numbers to these variables right
22:25 - that's why you see all these random
22:27 - numbers
22:28 - now when i just
22:30 - click on step over and move to the next
22:33 - breakpoint
22:35 - what happens here you can see num1
22:38 - is equal to 5 here right
22:40 - i can also watch for some specific
22:43 - variables let's say i want to watch the
22:45 - variable called sum which is this
22:47 - variable
22:48 - i can type the name of the variable and
22:50 - then press enter
22:52 - and then i can watch that variable
22:54 - specifically right so now the value of
22:58 - num1 is 5 because this line is executed
23:01 - but still
23:02 - this line is not executed so
23:05 - still num2
23:07 - has been assigned
23:09 - any random number in our in my case it's
23:12 - 16 but it can be any number
23:14 - because we haven't assigned 10 here
23:17 - because we are on this line
23:19 - when we go to the next line by clicking
23:22 - on step over you can see
23:24 - the number 10 is assigned to num2
23:27 - variable right
23:29 - but still the value of sum is 0 because
23:33 - at this point our program execution is
23:36 - stopped at this point so still the
23:39 - assignment is not
23:40 - has not been taken place so when i step
23:43 - over to the next line i can see
23:46 - the sum value which is 15 and
23:49 - you can see i was watching this variable
23:51 - also so this variable value is also 15
23:55 - right
23:56 - so this is how you can step over
23:59 - and step into a method or step out of
24:03 - the method using these buttons and you
24:05 - can keep the track of all these
24:08 - local and global variables on
24:11 - this
24:12 - section and then you also have the call
24:15 - stack so right now we are in the thread
24:18 - one which is our main thread if you were
24:21 - using multiple threads you will be able
24:23 - to
24:24 - see
24:25 - in which thread what is happening
24:27 - here in the call stack right
24:30 - so this is how you can debug your code
24:34 - you can stop this code by clicking on
24:36 - this
24:37 - stop icon here and you will come out of
24:41 - your debugger right
24:43 - and you can
24:44 - see the output of your debugger in this
24:47 - debug console right so you will be able
24:51 - to see where your program execution is
24:54 - where you have stopped in your program
24:57 - so we
24:58 - we stopped at break point three break
25:00 - point four so once i have chosen my
25:03 - debugger i can and next time i can
25:06 - always use uh
25:07 - this uh
25:09 - option from here from this list and then
25:11 - i can run the debugger okay again once
25:14 - you select all these options which i
25:16 - have shown you and when you go to the
25:18 - explorer section
25:20 - visual studio code is going to create
25:22 - this dot vs code file
25:25 - and here this launch dot json file is
25:29 - important
25:30 - where all the options which you have
25:32 - chosen for debugging
25:34 - are saved so here in this launch.json
25:38 - i can see the configuration the name of
25:40 - the configuration is g dot exe which is
25:44 - the same name here right
25:46 - and you can provide multiple
25:48 - configurations in this launch file
25:50 - that's why
25:52 - you can give the name to every
25:54 - configuration the type is cppdbg
25:59 - for cppdebugger request is launch
26:02 - and then which file you want to launch
26:06 - this means we are in the current
26:08 - directory and the file name is
26:11 - the same name as your cpp file name dot
26:15 - exe file
26:16 - and
26:18 - you can see which debugger you are using
26:21 - gdb
26:22 - and then you have the debugger path so
26:24 - in our case uh this debugger path is at
26:28 - this location so all the information
26:30 - about your debugger is
26:32 - there in
26:34 - your launch.json file so you can always
26:37 - change this configuration if you want to
26:40 - use some other debugger let's say
26:42 - microsoft debugger
26:44 - you can change this path for the
26:46 - debugger from here and then use the
26:48 - other debugger right you also have this
26:51 - tasks.json file
26:53 - where you will be able to see uh the
26:56 - commands you can see uh the command
26:59 - which is going to be used to run your
27:01 - program c g plus plus dot exe file is
27:05 - there and then you will be able to see
27:08 - the options for compiling or building
27:10 - your c plus plus code here so let's say
27:13 - i want to run my debugger once again so
27:16 - from the next time i can just click on
27:18 - this
27:19 - green start debugging button and it's
27:22 - going to start my
27:25 - code in the debugging mode so now once
27:28 - again you can see
27:29 - i am in the debugging mode so this is
27:32 - how you can set up visual studio code
27:34 - for cnc plus plus development on your
27:37 - windows 11 operating system i hope
27:40 - you've enjoyed this video and i will see
27:41 - you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can set up c and c plus plus support on your visual studio code editor on your windows 11 operating system so for this you will need two things first one is obvious which is visual studio code so if you haven't installed visual studio code i will recommend you to install it it's a very easy and simple process and if you don't know how to install visual studio code i will put the link of the video in which i have shown how you can install and use visual studio code and once you have visual studio code we need a second tool which is called a compiler right so a compiler will help you to compile your cnc plus plus code on any operating system so for windows we are going to install the mingw compiler so let's start with that so first of all open your favorite browser and search for bin gw and in the search result you will see some websites so don't click on the first website which you will see here which is from sourceforge you need to open this website which says mingw iphone w64.org so just click on this link which says mingw hyphen w64.org and once this website opens you will be able to see the overview here and on this website you can click on the downloads link here so here you will be able to see all the download link for bing w for different operating systems so the one we are looking for is the windows version so we are going to click on this link which says mingw w64 builds so just click on this link which is going to open this kind of window again and from here you can download the mingw builds from sourceforge so you need to click on this link now right so sourceforge link was uh shown directly in the search result but you need to go through this website in order to come to this website and once you are redirected to the sourceforge.net website you will see that min gw 64bit installer exe file will be downloaded on your windows 11 operating system so once this file is downloaded i'm going to click on this file and then you will see this warning which says do you want to allow this app from unknown publisher to make changes on your device i trust this so i will click on yes here and i'm going to minimize this browser and you can see mingw installer has been started on my windows 11 operating system so on the first window i just need to click on next here which is going to start the installation here you can choose the version for mingw so i'm going to choose the topmost option which is 8.1.3 at the time of making this video you can also choose the architecture i'm going to choose x 8664 and then you can choose the threads so generally for threads i always choose 6 but you can also choose win32 also also exception you have two options i will leave it as default and then you have the build revision i will leave it as default also and then click on next and this will be the location where your mingw compiler will be installed so you can see it will be installed in the program files min gw directory will be created and then this folder will be created right so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and also you can leave this checkbox as checked which is going to create a shortcut for your mingw uh compiler tool so i'm going to click on next now which is going to start the download of all the files and packages for your mingw tools so just wait for this process to reach to the 100 mark so now after some time i can see this window which says click next to continue the installation so i'm going to click on the next and now i can see this message which says mingw has been successfully installed and i can click on finish to complete the installation so let me click on the finish button so once i click on the finish button mingw is installed on my windows operating systems so now once mingw is installed first of all we need to know the location where mingw is installed so at the time of installation you might have noted the location so let me show you the default location where mingw will be installed so you need to go inside the c directory and then go inside program files and then you will be able to see this mingw hyphen w 64 bit folder here and then this folder will be there so this is the location where mingw is installed then you need to go inside mingw64 and here under the bin folder you will see all the files which will help you to compile your c or c plus programs okay so go until the bin folder right and you need to copy this path now we need to set the environment variable for mingw so that we can use gcc or g plus plus command on our windows command prompt or powershell or terminal so for that what you need to do you just need to click on search and then search for edit env and it's going to show you this result which says edit environment variables for your account and you can see this window is going to open right now if you can't find this edit environment variable window using the search option then you can always open the control panel and then once control panel opens you need to view by category here and then click on system and security and then once again click on system here which is going to open the settings app and here it's going to show you an about section this link which says advanced system settings so just click on that and then click on environment variables which is also going to open the same window so you can choose any one of the method so once this environment variables window opens select path under system variables and then click on edit and then click on new here okay so it's going to allow you to add a new environment variable and then just copy the path until the bin folder inside your mingw 64 bit folder okay so this path is until bin folder okay and once you copied it you can just add this path here inside your environment variable and then just press enter which is going to add your path and then click ok here and then click ok and then once again click on ok and now you can close all the windows here and now we can test our gcc and g plus plus versions and commands right so you can open the command prompt by just pressing cmd and then open the command prompt from the result and once the command prompt is open here you can just write gcc space hyphen hyphen version and then press enter and if you see some result which looks like this that means gcc command is working successfully on your windows 11 operating system similarly you can also check the g plus plus command which is also used to compile your c plus plus programs so it's also going to show you this kind of result here so once you see this kind of result that means your gcc and g plus plus commands are working so once you have installed the min gw compiler and you have set the environment variables for gcc and g plus plus we are ready to create our first c plus plus code so let's start with the very basics so what i'm going to do is i'm going to open my command prompt so for that i'm going to just search for cmd and then press enter which is going to open my command prompt and then let's say i'm going to create a folder in which i want to have all my c plus related files right so let's say i want to create this folder on my desktop i'm going to just cd to my desktop first of all and then i'm going to create a folder and on command prompt to create a folder you can give this command mkdir and then let's say i want to name my folder as my cpp app and then i'm going to just press enter which is going to create the folder with this name you can also right click here and then create the folder uh if you want you don't need to create it with the help of command prompt so once this folder is created i'm going to cd in this folder and then when i type on the command prompt code space dot and then press enter it's going to open visual studio code and this folder will be opened in visual studio code from which i have given this command right so currently i am in my cpp app folder in the command prompt right and when i gave this command it's going to open this folder in visual studio code here i can create a cpp file so let's create a very basic c plus file i'm going to name my file as main dot cpp here and then press enter which is going to create this file now as soon as i create the c plus plus file visual studio code is going to recognize that and it's going to show me some recommendations you can see do you want to install recommended extension for c plus plus so here you can click on this option don't click on install but because we want to see which extensions we are going to install so i'm going to click on show recommendations here and here it's going to open this extensions tab right so on the left hand side you have this bar and when you just hover over this extensions icon here you will be able to see that it's for extension so just click on this and then you will be able to see many extensions for cnc plus plus right so right now the recommended extension by visual studio code for us is this one which is created by microsoft you can see and the number of downloads are also given here so around 3.3 million downloads are done for this extension so if you don't see this recommendation you can always go to this extensions tab here and then search for c plus plus and once you search for c plus it's going to show you uh all these recommendations right so the first the topmost option is going to be the option which you will require so you can see this one and it's from microsoft once again and for this extension you can see the number of downloads are 27 million and what it does it provides the support for c and c plus intellisense debugging and code browsing so we are going to install the c c plus plus extension first of all and just click on the install button which is going to start the installation process of this extension same we are going to do for this one which is called c slash c plus plus extension pack so just uh choose this uh extension also which is called c slash c plus plus extension pack and then click on install which is going to install nine essential c and c plus plus related packs right so we have already installed the cnc plus plus intellisense debugging and code browsing extension in addition it's going to install all these extensions so that we can run our c or c plus plus code on visual studio code editor right so if you want to use c make or make or any other kind of tool to build your c plus plus program this extension is going to install all the related extensions for that so you can see all the extensions in this pack are installed and now you will be able to see disable and uninstall option and let's write some code so first of all we are going to include this iostream package so i'm going to just write include and you can see at every point you will get the installations to complete your code so when i just type this angle bracket it shows me all the options and then when i just type io i can see all these packages which starts from i o right i need this i o stream so i'm going to select this and it's going to just add the ending angle bracket also then i'm going to create the main method which is simple int main and then these parentheses and then these curly brackets here i just want to let's say print hello world so i'm going to just write std colon colon c out and then i want to print hello world so once you have written your code you can save your code by just pressing ctrl s which is going to save your code and then you are ready to run your code so how you can run your code on your visual studio code editor so in order to run your code you have the option to open the terminal and run your code there or you can just select this terminal option and you have this run task run build task so i'm going to select this option which says run build task you can also press ctrl shift b for running this build task so let me just click on this and as soon as i click on this option i will see all these options here so for building my c plus program i will require g plus plus dot exe file right if you need to compile the c program so if this file name was main dot c file and you wanted to compile the c program you could have chosen gcc dot exc right so for c plus we use g plus plus and for c programs we use gcc so in my case i'm going to use this option which says g plus plus exe build active file and what it's going to do it's going to build my file and you can see build finished successfully so my build was finished successfully and you can see this main.exe file is generated so now i just need to run this exe file and see what is the output right so for this i can open a new terminal you can open the new terminal by just selecting this terminal option and then click on new terminal or you can click on this plus button which is going to open the new terminal now as you can see the type of terminal which is opened right so by default because powershell is the default terminal on my windows 11 operating system so it has opened powershell but let's say i want to open the normal command prompt right i can open it by just clicking on this arrow button and then i can select command prompt from here and it's going to open the command prompt you can see which type of terminal or command prompt is open on the right hand side in this list so i have this power shell terminal open i have this command prompt terminal open and it's similar to opening your cmd on your windows operating system or power shell on your windows operating system so you can see this windows powershell so it's similar to opening uh these uh powershell or command prompt on your windows 11 operating system they are just opened in your visual studio code so they come integrated with your visual studio code from here i select cmd option so i want to run my exe file using command prompt so i can just type the name of my exe file which is main dot exe and then press enter which is going to print the output here which is hello world in my case right so that's how you can run your program using powershell so if you want to use powershell so for the powershell you just need to write dot and then the backslash and the name of your exe which is main dot exe file and then press enter which is also going to show you the hello world result so you can run your exe file using command prompt also and from the powershell also now let me add some more code and i will show you how you can debug your c plus plus program on visual studio code so very simple nothing complicated about this program i just want to show how you can debug your c plus code so in order to debug your c plus plus code you uh select this option which is called run and debug and here you can see a few options so you can click on run and debug button here which is going to run your program in a debugger you can also create a launch.json file to customize uh your debugging options right so for now what i'm going to do i'm going to just add a few uh break points here and you will see the list of all the breakpoints in this list under breakpoint so so you will be able to see the list of all the break points you can see it's in the main.cpp file and then they are at line four five and six right you can disable all the breakpoints by just pressing this button which says toggle active breakpoints and it's going to disable all these break points it's not going to remove the break points but these break points will be disabled you can also remove all these break points by just pressing this option which says remove all breakpoints and it's going to remove all the breakpoints so let me add these breakpoints once again and let's run this debugger so i'm going to click on run and debug button and once again visual studio code is going to ask us which debugger we want to use right so depending upon the debugger available on your windows 11 operating system you can choose from those debuggers because we have installed the min gw as a compiler on our windows operating system we are going to choose the first option which is c plus plus gdb lldb okay so i'm going to select this option and this is going to uh give me once again these options right so now uh as i said for c plus plus programs you choose the g plus plus dot exe file and for c programs you can choose gcc dot exe files right so i'm going to select the g plus plus dot exe file for c plus plus and it's going to run my program in the debugger and you can see it's starting the debugger here and now my program is running in the debug mode so how can i understand that my program is in debug mode you will be able to see this specific color for debugging right so this bar color is changed for the debugging and you will be able to see all these options for debugging so from this option you can continue to uh the next code and then using this you can step over in the code and then you can step into the code and then step out of the code and then you can rerun your debugging once again and you can stop your debugging using this icon now because we have added this breakpoint our program execution is stopped at this line 4 which is our first breakpoint and on the left hand side you will be able to see the list of all variables and the values for these variables so right now the variable 1 have zero value variable to have 16 and variable sum has zero value because at this point these numbers are not assigned to our variables c plus plus is going to assign the random numbers to these variables right that's why you see all these random numbers now when i just click on step over and move to the next breakpoint what happens here you can see num1 is equal to 5 here right i can also watch for some specific variables let's say i want to watch the variable called sum which is this variable i can type the name of the variable and then press enter and then i can watch that variable specifically right so now the value of num1 is 5 because this line is executed but still this line is not executed so still num2 has been assigned any random number in our in my case it's 16 but it can be any number because we haven't assigned 10 here because we are on this line when we go to the next line by clicking on step over you can see the number 10 is assigned to num2 variable right but still the value of sum is 0 because at this point our program execution is stopped at this point so still the assignment is not has not been taken place so when i step over to the next line i can see the sum value which is 15 and you can see i was watching this variable also so this variable value is also 15 right so this is how you can step over and step into a method or step out of the method using these buttons and you can keep the track of all these local and global variables on this section and then you also have the call stack so right now we are in the thread one which is our main thread if you were using multiple threads you will be able to see in which thread what is happening here in the call stack right so this is how you can debug your code you can stop this code by clicking on this stop icon here and you will come out of your debugger right and you can see the output of your debugger in this debug console right so you will be able to see where your program execution is where you have stopped in your program so we we stopped at break point three break point four so once i have chosen my debugger i can and next time i can always use uh this uh option from here from this list and then i can run the debugger okay again once you select all these options which i have shown you and when you go to the explorer section visual studio code is going to create this dot vs code file and here this launch dot json file is important where all the options which you have chosen for debugging are saved so here in this launch.json i can see the configuration the name of the configuration is g dot exe which is the same name here right and you can provide multiple configurations in this launch file that's why you can give the name to every configuration the type is cppdbg for cppdebugger request is launch and then which file you want to launch this means we are in the current directory and the file name is the same name as your cpp file name dot exe file and you can see which debugger you are using gdb and then you have the debugger path so in our case uh this debugger path is at this location so all the information about your debugger is there in your launch.json file so you can always change this configuration if you want to use some other debugger let's say microsoft debugger you can change this path for the debugger from here and then use the other debugger right you also have this tasks.json file where you will be able to see uh the commands you can see uh the command which is going to be used to run your program c g plus plus dot exe file is there and then you will be able to see the options for compiling or building your c plus plus code here so let's say i want to run my debugger once again so from the next time i can just click on this green start debugging button and it's going to start my code in the debugging mode so now once again you can see i am in the debugging mode so this is how you can set up visual studio code for cnc plus plus development on your windows 11 operating system i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
