00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - register tours for beginners in the last
00:04 - video we have seen how we can use some
00:06 - of the command with the string values
00:08 - now in this video also we will see some
00:11 - more command which we can use with the
00:13 - string values in Redis so let's get
00:17 - started first of all I will show you one
00:20 - command which is valid in Linux terminal
00:23 - also which is the clear command so when
00:26 - you do clear it's going to clear your
00:30 - terminal right so you can see when I
00:33 - have given the clear command it's going
00:35 - to clear the terminal and basically what
00:38 - it does is it just gives some of the
00:41 - some space in between your last command
00:46 - which you have executed and this after
00:50 - this clear okay so now you can see this
00:54 - terminal is totally empty now right and
00:57 - now we can start executing some of the
01:01 - other command so right now our database
01:04 - is totally empty I think so we can check
01:07 - it with keys Astrix and now let's set
01:10 - some values and this time we can use a
01:15 - command which is called set e^x okay and
01:21 - this set e^x is the command of which we
01:25 - can use with second so you just need to
01:28 - write set e^x and this means set the
01:31 - value with the expiry of the key okay
01:35 - and then for example I just give the key
01:38 - and then I need to give some second so
01:42 - you can see the next option I need to
01:45 - give here is the number of seconds I
01:47 - want this key to live in my ready
01:52 - database and after that it will be
01:54 - automatically deleted so for example 10
01:57 - second I want to give here and then I
02:00 - want to give the value of it for example
02:03 - max okay now when I just press ENTER it
02:10 - is going to say ok and when I
02:13 - just get name it's there right and then
02:17 - there is a command called TTL and then
02:21 - you can use the key with this and it
02:25 - says - and what is this - so TTL is the
02:29 - command for time-to-live so it will
02:33 - check for how much time or how long is
02:37 - this key is going to live okay now it's
02:41 - a is two seconds okay so this is time to
02:44 - live and then the key and then it
02:48 - returns us to second because eight Tests
02:51 - a second has already passed often after
02:54 - giving this command and once again for
02:57 - example I will just say get name and
03:01 - it's no longer there right because we
03:04 - have just set a ten-second expiry on
03:08 - this key so after 10 second it will be
03:11 - automatically deleted right for example
03:14 - I will just give 50 second expiry for
03:17 - example here so five zero Max and then I
03:22 - will just give a TTL and then name and
03:26 - then you can see it shows 44 seconds
03:30 - once again 40 second and then it will
03:34 - show you the seconds for which this key
03:38 - is going to live okay and after 36
03:41 - second it will be deleted right so these
03:44 - are two more command which you can use
03:47 - with the string right now let's set one
03:50 - more value for example set the name to
03:55 - and name - is equal to Tom okay and now
04:01 - we can for example
04:04 - overwrite this value so I has told you
04:06 - whenever you write something like this
04:08 - set name - and some other name for
04:12 - example John then it will overwrite the
04:17 - value of name - for example I take name
04:22 - - as my key and give some other value it
04:25 - will overwrite but if you don't know
04:27 - if name too is there and if you don't
04:30 - want to overwrite name - then you can
04:34 - use this command called set and X and
04:36 - this set an x cost of all checks if B
04:40 - this key is available or not and if this
04:43 - key is not available
04:45 - then only it's going to you know create
04:48 - this key otherwise it's going to just
04:51 - ignore right so let's take this come on
04:55 - and save zero zero because no key is
05:00 - affected due to this command that means
05:03 - when we do get name - we can see this
05:10 - name is not overwritten because this
05:13 - command is used or will be successful
05:16 - when this key is not available in the
05:20 - database right if it's available then
05:24 - it's going to just ignore and if it's
05:27 - not available then it is going to create
05:29 - a new value for example I will just give
05:32 - set and X 3 and this value is not
05:36 - available there so I will just give some
05:41 - other name and it says integer 1 that
05:45 - means 1 value is affected and then I
05:48 - will just do keys Astrix to see the
05:52 - values ok and I can see name - is there
05:56 - and name 3 is there that means this was
05:59 - successful right and I can also get the
06:02 - value from get name 3 also and I can see
06:07 - that value is there let me clear this
06:10 - terminal now if you want to know the
06:12 - length of the value stored in the key
06:15 - then you can just use STR le n command
06:20 - ok and then the key name for example
06:22 - name - and it's going to give you the
06:25 - length of that key that means for
06:29 - example I do get name - here you can see
06:33 - it's a three character word and that's
06:35 - the length of this value right and
06:38 - that's the result here okay
06:40 - now for example if you want to set
06:42 - multiple values with the same command we
06:45 - use em set so just use em set and then
06:49 - the key and the value
06:51 - for example this time I want to insert
06:55 - some numbers so I will just say num1 and
06:59 - I will just give 50 here and then after
07:03 - a space I will just write num2 and then
07:07 - I will say 60 here number 3 and for
07:12 - example 70 and so on right and then
07:15 - press ENTER and it says okay and then
07:18 - when I say keys keys Astrix it's going
07:24 - to give me name 3 and name to which were
07:26 - already there and then num1 and num2
07:29 - because here you can see I have given
07:32 - the same key two times right so num1 was
07:36 - there num2 and num2 I have given two
07:38 - times let's see the value inside the
07:41 - num2
07:41 - so num to get num2 and let us see the
07:47 - value inside it so the value inside is
07:49 - is the last set value so whatever is the
07:53 - last set value you will set for this key
07:57 - it will show you that our value here
08:01 - right so once again for example I will
08:05 - just give em set I am set and then
08:09 - number three here and then give the
08:13 - value of for example 60 here and then
08:16 - once again do the key efflux is going to
08:20 - give me name three named num three numb
08:23 - to name two n 1 right so right now I
08:27 - have two names and three numbers inside
08:31 - my database now if we want to set the
08:34 - x-pyr e in millisecond there is a
08:36 - command called P set X and then it takes
08:41 - the value in milliseconds you can see in
08:43 - the intellisense also right so i am not
08:46 - going to set any value here but i just
08:50 - wanted to show you this command also
08:52 - exists which will take
08:54 - the value of seconds in milliseconds
08:57 - right so this is P set X okay now there
09:02 - is a one more command which is called de
09:05 - CR and incr which we use to increment
09:11 - and decrement the value of some key so
09:15 - for example I want to increment the
09:16 - value of key num1 so let's see the value
09:21 - first of all so value of num1 is right
09:26 - now 50 and then we can just write de CR
09:32 - num 1 and then press enter and now the
09:38 - value becomes 49 right it will give you
09:41 - the result and when you give get num 1
09:43 - is going to give you the value 49 so
09:46 - this dec our command will decrement the
09:50 - value by 1 and if you do a n see our
09:54 - command to the number 1 for example once
09:58 - again the value will become 50 so I NCR
10:02 - and Dec are is to decrease and increase
10:05 - the value by 1 okay let me clear this
10:08 - terminal once again now there is one
10:11 - more command to increment or decrement
10:15 - the value by some number and this is for
10:19 - example a and C are by so incr by and
10:25 - the key name for example number one once
10:29 - again and I want to increment this the
10:31 - value of num1 by 5 so earlier it was 50
10:35 - right and then it's going to become 55
10:38 - because I have incrementing the value by
10:41 - 5 in the same way I can do dec R by and
10:46 - on the same number number 1 and for
10:50 - example I want to reduce the value by 30
10:53 - right and then press Enter and now it
10:56 - becomes 25 so you get number 1 and the
11:01 - result or the value inside it is 25 now
11:04 - the last command I want to show here is
11:08 - the append command so let me just set
11:14 - one more value for example set and then
11:17 - the key name for example I will name it
11:20 - as my key okay and the value here I want
11:25 - to set is hello okay and then press
11:30 - Enter
11:31 - and then get my key its hello right now
11:37 - there is a append command so I can just
11:39 - use a pp and E append and as the name
11:43 - suggests I can append something to the
11:47 - key right so I want to append to my key
11:51 - so I will just write the key name and
11:52 - whatever string you want to append here
11:55 - so for example in double quotes I will
11:58 - just give a space here and then I will
12:01 - just write word here okay and then press
12:03 - ENTER and you can see the number of
12:07 - characters I think for the new value
12:09 - right so once again get my key as you're
12:15 - going to give me hello world so space
12:17 - world is appended to the my key right so
12:24 - append is used to append a string so
12:26 - these are some of the other command
12:28 - which you can use with the string values
12:30 - I hope you have enjoyed this video
12:31 - please rate comment and subscribe and
12:33 - bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to the next video on register tours for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use some of the command with the string values now in this video also we will see some more command which we can use with the string values in Redis so let's get started first of all I will show you one command which is valid in Linux terminal also which is the clear command so when you do clear it's going to clear your terminal right so you can see when I have given the clear command it's going to clear the terminal and basically what it does is it just gives some of the some space in between your last command which you have executed and this after this clear okay so now you can see this terminal is totally empty now right and now we can start executing some of the other command so right now our database is totally empty I think so we can check it with keys Astrix and now let's set some values and this time we can use a command which is called set e^x okay and this set e^x is the command of which we can use with second so you just need to write set e^x and this means set the value with the expiry of the key okay and then for example I just give the key and then I need to give some second so you can see the next option I need to give here is the number of seconds I want this key to live in my ready database and after that it will be automatically deleted so for example 10 second I want to give here and then I want to give the value of it for example max okay now when I just press ENTER it is going to say ok and when I just get name it's there right and then there is a command called TTL and then you can use the key with this and it says and what is this so TTL is the command for timetolive so it will check for how much time or how long is this key is going to live okay now it's a is two seconds okay so this is time to live and then the key and then it returns us to second because eight Tests a second has already passed often after giving this command and once again for example I will just say get name and it's no longer there right because we have just set a tensecond expiry on this key so after 10 second it will be automatically deleted right for example I will just give 50 second expiry for example here so five zero Max and then I will just give a TTL and then name and then you can see it shows 44 seconds once again 40 second and then it will show you the seconds for which this key is going to live okay and after 36 second it will be deleted right so these are two more command which you can use with the string right now let's set one more value for example set the name to and name is equal to Tom okay and now we can for example overwrite this value so I has told you whenever you write something like this set name and some other name for example John then it will overwrite the value of name for example I take name as my key and give some other value it will overwrite but if you don't know if name too is there and if you don't want to overwrite name then you can use this command called set and X and this set an x cost of all checks if B this key is available or not and if this key is not available then only it's going to you know create this key otherwise it's going to just ignore right so let's take this come on and save zero zero because no key is affected due to this command that means when we do get name we can see this name is not overwritten because this command is used or will be successful when this key is not available in the database right if it's available then it's going to just ignore and if it's not available then it is going to create a new value for example I will just give set and X 3 and this value is not available there so I will just give some other name and it says integer 1 that means 1 value is affected and then I will just do keys Astrix to see the values ok and I can see name is there and name 3 is there that means this was successful right and I can also get the value from get name 3 also and I can see that value is there let me clear this terminal now if you want to know the length of the value stored in the key then you can just use STR le n command ok and then the key name for example name and it's going to give you the length of that key that means for example I do get name here you can see it's a three character word and that's the length of this value right and that's the result here okay now for example if you want to set multiple values with the same command we use em set so just use em set and then the key and the value for example this time I want to insert some numbers so I will just say num1 and I will just give 50 here and then after a space I will just write num2 and then I will say 60 here number 3 and for example 70 and so on right and then press ENTER and it says okay and then when I say keys keys Astrix it's going to give me name 3 and name to which were already there and then num1 and num2 because here you can see I have given the same key two times right so num1 was there num2 and num2 I have given two times let's see the value inside the num2 so num to get num2 and let us see the value inside it so the value inside is is the last set value so whatever is the last set value you will set for this key it will show you that our value here right so once again for example I will just give em set I am set and then number three here and then give the value of for example 60 here and then once again do the key efflux is going to give me name three named num three numb to name two n 1 right so right now I have two names and three numbers inside my database now if we want to set the xpyr e in millisecond there is a command called P set X and then it takes the value in milliseconds you can see in the intellisense also right so i am not going to set any value here but i just wanted to show you this command also exists which will take the value of seconds in milliseconds right so this is P set X okay now there is a one more command which is called de CR and incr which we use to increment and decrement the value of some key so for example I want to increment the value of key num1 so let's see the value first of all so value of num1 is right now 50 and then we can just write de CR num 1 and then press enter and now the value becomes 49 right it will give you the result and when you give get num 1 is going to give you the value 49 so this dec our command will decrement the value by 1 and if you do a n see our command to the number 1 for example once again the value will become 50 so I NCR and Dec are is to decrease and increase the value by 1 okay let me clear this terminal once again now there is one more command to increment or decrement the value by some number and this is for example a and C are by so incr by and the key name for example number one once again and I want to increment this the value of num1 by 5 so earlier it was 50 right and then it's going to become 55 because I have incrementing the value by 5 in the same way I can do dec R by and on the same number number 1 and for example I want to reduce the value by 30 right and then press Enter and now it becomes 25 so you get number 1 and the result or the value inside it is 25 now the last command I want to show here is the append command so let me just set one more value for example set and then the key name for example I will name it as my key okay and the value here I want to set is hello okay and then press Enter and then get my key its hello right now there is a append command so I can just use a pp and E append and as the name suggests I can append something to the key right so I want to append to my key so I will just write the key name and whatever string you want to append here so for example in double quotes I will just give a space here and then I will just write word here okay and then press ENTER and you can see the number of characters I think for the new value right so once again get my key as you're going to give me hello world so space world is appended to the my key right so append is used to append a string so these are some of the other command which you can use with the string values I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
