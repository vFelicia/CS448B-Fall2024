00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can create your first
00:04 - Java FX project in IntelliJ IDEA IDE
00:07 - using scene builder I'm also going to
00:10 - show you how you can download and
00:12 - install scene builder on your Windows
00:15 - operating system and set up with your
00:18 - IntelliJ IDEA IDE so let's get started
00:22 - first of all we are going to create a
00:24 - new Java FX project and then we are
00:27 - going to download and install this scene
00:30 - builder ok so just open up your IntelliJ
00:34 - IDEA IDE and we are going to create a
00:36 - new project from here and in here you
00:39 - can see different options on the left
00:42 - hand side so we are going to choose this
00:44 - Java FX option which is fairly simple so
00:48 - just choose Java FX and then click Next
00:52 - and in here you just need to give the
00:54 - title to your project for example Java
00:57 - FX project and then I'm going to just
01:03 - click finish and this is going to create
01:06 - a Java fix project for us ok so this is
01:09 - really simple and fairly simple so let's
01:13 - see what are the files which are present
01:15 - inside our Java FX project so I'm going
01:19 - to just expand this and in the source
01:23 - folder we have three files one is the
01:27 - main file which we expect and there is a
01:31 - bear bone or you know code there for the
01:34 - main class right and then we have a
01:37 - controller and then we have a F XML file
01:41 - so this F XML file is responsible for
01:45 - the design of our you know JavaFX scene
01:50 - you can say ok and right now we don't
01:55 - have seen builder scene builder is a
01:58 - tool in which you can you know design
02:00 - your UI ok so you can see here there is
02:04 - an option for scene builder but when I
02:08 - click this option it says please
02:10 - configure JavaFX scene builder path
02:12 - right
02:13 - so right now there is no scene builder
02:15 - installed and when I run this program so
02:19 - I'm going to just click this green
02:20 - button and I'm going to run this it's
02:23 - going to just show us a blank you know
02:28 - scene you can see here so and our clock
02:32 - controller class is empty only our main
02:35 - class is here and the main class we are
02:39 - calling the launch function in the main
02:42 - method here and there is one more method
02:45 - which is start method which we are
02:48 - overriding and in here we are just you
02:52 - know calling our F XML file and then we
02:57 - are creating the stage for us right
03:00 - whose width is 300 and height is 275 so
03:06 - let's see how we can download and
03:08 - install scene builder and then we will
03:11 - configure scene builder with IntelliJ
03:14 - IDEA so just open your favorite browser
03:16 - and search for java vaccine builder and
03:19 - the strangely oracle doesn't support
03:24 - scene builder anymore so if you want our
03:27 - latest version of scene builder you need
03:30 - to go to a website called gluon hq.com
03:34 - which is this one okay so you don't need
03:37 - to go to oracle calm but go to drill one
03:40 - hq.com slash open slow slash C in
03:45 - Builder which is this option okay
03:47 - so just click this option and in here
03:50 - you can see this would glue on website
03:53 - and in here you can see the download now
03:57 - button so you just need to click
03:58 - download now and you can see different
04:01 - options here so the one we are
04:06 - interested in is this option which is
04:08 - for Windows x64 which is for windows
04:12 - 64-bit operating system which is this
04:15 - third option so you just need to click
04:17 - this download button and once this
04:20 - executable file will be downloaded you
04:23 - just need to run the executable file
04:25 - it's not you know very complicated to
04:28 - install it you just need to click some
04:30 - Next button and it will be installed but
04:33 - after installing it the step after
04:36 - installing is important so once you have
04:39 - installed this scene builder on your
04:42 - Windows operating system there is a
04:44 - fixed path in which it's installed by
04:47 - default and this part we are going to
04:49 - see right now so just open your folder
04:52 - Explorer and in here go to C Drive here
04:56 - and the C Drive go to users and the
05:00 - users go to your computer name in my
05:03 - case my computer name is programming
05:05 - knowledge in your case this will be your
05:08 - name or whatever your computer name is
05:10 - so I'm going to click this and in here I
05:13 - am going to go inside the app data
05:16 - folder okay so a gap data folder and
05:20 - inside the app data I have this local
05:23 - folder inside the local folder I will be
05:27 - able to find this scene builder folder
05:29 - okay so once you download and install
05:33 - the scene builder it will be you know
05:36 - located at this location so go to this
05:40 - location I am going to just paste this
05:42 - part in the description also so that you
05:46 - don't forget it okay so go to this path
05:50 - until local and then if you see scene
05:53 - builder after installing scene builder
05:55 - just select this and cut it from here so
05:58 - I'm going to just select it and cut this
06:01 - folder from here and I'm going to paste
06:04 - it in my C Drive so I will just go to my
06:07 - C Drive and in here I'm going to paste
06:10 - it okay so why I'm doing this because
06:13 - it's a simple path which I can remember
06:15 - and it's not really complicated right so
06:19 - now I have the scene builder folder in
06:22 - my C Drive right and when I open it it
06:26 - has this scene builder dot exe file okay
06:30 - so once you have the scene builder dot
06:33 - exe file here we are ready to you know
06:37 - provide the part Oh
06:38 - of this folder in the IntelliJ IDEA so
06:42 - I'm going to minimize everything and in
06:44 - the IntelliJ IDEA first of all maybe I
06:46 - can copy this part and the IntelliJ IDEA
06:50 - just open your sample of XML file I'm
06:54 - going to minimize this also and in the
06:57 - sample dot F XML file here I'm going to
07:00 - just choose the scene builder option and
07:03 - then I will click path here okay and
07:06 - then in here I will be able to find the
07:10 - path of my scene builder folder so let's
07:14 - see where it is so here it is right so I
07:20 - just click this scene builder here and
07:24 - then just choose the executable file for
07:27 - the scene builder which is this one okay
07:29 - so choose scene builder dot exe from
07:32 - here inside the scene builder and then
07:35 - click OK and once you click OK
07:39 - it's going to configure scene builder
07:41 - here and then you can see our sample dot
07:46 - effects a new file is shown in the scene
07:49 - builder you know design of you ok so I'm
07:53 - going to just maximize it so that we can
07:56 - see it better and right now it doesn't
08:00 - have anything so right now we can see
08:04 - there is a grid pane here but it doesn't
08:07 - have the size and width here so you can
08:11 - go to the layout property here you can
08:14 - see and in the layout property there is
08:17 - a prep width and prep height which you
08:20 - can change so you can just give the prep
08:25 - width for example 300 and pref height is
08:30 - equal to 300 year and press Enter and
08:33 - now you can see some kind of grid pain
08:37 - here ok and when you save it and go to
08:41 - the text view you will be able to see
08:44 - here pref width is set to 300 and pref
08:48 - height is set to 300 here okay so
08:51 - whatever you change in the designer it's
08:53 - going to be implemented in this F XML
08:56 - file also okay so what we are going to
09:00 - do now is we are going to take a button
09:02 - so we will go to controls option here
09:05 - and the first option here in control
09:07 - says button so we are going to drag and
09:09 - drop this button in the grid pane and
09:12 - you can just resize it and now what we
09:18 - are going to do is we want to click this
09:21 - button and we want to perform some
09:23 - action right so what we will do now is
09:27 - we are going to you know write some code
09:31 - in the controller class in order to you
09:35 - know you know execute the button press
09:38 - event okay so when you go to the text
09:43 - option here and the sample dot F XML
09:47 - file when you just scroll it on the
09:51 - right hand side you can see our
09:53 - controller class is sample dot
09:56 - controller right so by default it's
09:59 - simple dot controller which is this
10:01 - class which is automatically created for
10:05 - us so we will go to the controller class
10:07 - and inside the controller class we will
10:10 - just create a method for example public
10:14 - void for example press button and it's
10:21 - going to take one argument which is
10:23 - action event so just write action event
10:30 - okay and just write the name of your
10:35 - argument for example event itself and
10:38 - then we are going to execute some code
10:42 - inside this method so for simplicity I'm
10:46 - going to just print something for
10:47 - example I'm going to just write s out
10:50 - and press the tab button which is going
10:53 - to generate this code for me for
10:55 - printing some line so print line and
10:58 - then I am going to just write hello okay
11:01 - so I'm going to pray
11:03 - hello world whenever somebody presses
11:05 - this button and now save this code and
11:09 - then go to your sample dot F XML file
11:12 - here and then go to the scene builder
11:15 - here and in the scene builder go at the
11:19 - right bottom and here you will be able
11:22 - to see this code so just click code here
11:25 - and in the code you will be able to find
11:30 - this FX ID so in the controller first of
11:34 - all we need to define this FX ID for the
11:39 - button right so what we are going to do
11:41 - next a we can give some ID to our button
11:46 - here so for example BTN MSG for message
11:53 - button message write msg it's not
11:56 - necessary for this step but later
11:59 - whenever you you know put some label or
12:03 - some other component here or widget here
12:07 - you may have to give the FX ID for that
12:11 - and then you need to define that FX ID
12:14 - in your controller but for now we just
12:17 - want to you know perform the button
12:20 - action method so what we can do right
12:23 - now is we can go to just select first of
12:27 - all this button here and make sure you
12:30 - have given this button message or any ID
12:33 - to your button and then in on action you
12:38 - know category here you will be able to
12:40 - find your method you have defined which
12:42 - is press button right so we have defined
12:45 - this press button method here you see we
12:48 - have just defined this method so as soon
12:51 - as you save your code you will be able
12:53 - to see this when you drag and drop here
12:58 - button press ok so this is the same
13:00 - method which we have defined in the
13:02 - controller okay and give the FX ID also
13:06 - right and then save your code and now we
13:11 - are going to run
13:13 - code okay so let's run the code and
13:16 - let's see what happens from now so right
13:20 - now it's showing me some errors so let's
13:24 - see what the error is
13:25 - so I can see here the error here is
13:29 - error resolving on action press button
13:33 - either the event handler is not the
13:36 - namespace or there is error in the
13:39 - script right so when I open this
13:41 - controller dot Java class here in the
13:45 - import by default it takes the action
13:50 - event class from AWT which we don't want
13:55 - right we want the class from the JavaFX
14:00 - right so instead of this Java dot aw t
14:04 - dot event dot action event we want this
14:08 - option which is Java FX dot event dot
14:14 - action event we want this action event
14:17 - class not the aw T action event class
14:20 - and that's why this error was you know
14:23 - given to us so by default it was taking
14:25 - the aw T action event class right
14:28 - so just correct this input and then save
14:31 - it once again and we are going to run it
14:33 - once again and hopefully the error will
14:35 - be gone this time so now our you know
14:39 - window is open and when I click this
14:42 - button hopefully we will be able to see
14:44 - hello world here also so I will click
14:46 - the button and you can see hello world
14:49 - is printed once again hello a world is
14:52 - printed when I click the button right so
14:56 - this is fairly simple okay so in this
14:59 - way you can create your first Java FX
15:02 - project in IntelliJ IDEA using the scene
15:06 - builder so I hope you have enjoyed this
15:08 - video please rate comment subscribe and
15:10 - bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your first Java FX project in IntelliJ IDEA IDE using scene builder I'm also going to show you how you can download and install scene builder on your Windows operating system and set up with your IntelliJ IDEA IDE so let's get started first of all we are going to create a new Java FX project and then we are going to download and install this scene builder ok so just open up your IntelliJ IDEA IDE and we are going to create a new project from here and in here you can see different options on the left hand side so we are going to choose this Java FX option which is fairly simple so just choose Java FX and then click Next and in here you just need to give the title to your project for example Java FX project and then I'm going to just click finish and this is going to create a Java fix project for us ok so this is really simple and fairly simple so let's see what are the files which are present inside our Java FX project so I'm going to just expand this and in the source folder we have three files one is the main file which we expect and there is a bear bone or you know code there for the main class right and then we have a controller and then we have a F XML file so this F XML file is responsible for the design of our you know JavaFX scene you can say ok and right now we don't have seen builder scene builder is a tool in which you can you know design your UI ok so you can see here there is an option for scene builder but when I click this option it says please configure JavaFX scene builder path right so right now there is no scene builder installed and when I run this program so I'm going to just click this green button and I'm going to run this it's going to just show us a blank you know scene you can see here so and our clock controller class is empty only our main class is here and the main class we are calling the launch function in the main method here and there is one more method which is start method which we are overriding and in here we are just you know calling our F XML file and then we are creating the stage for us right whose width is 300 and height is 275 so let's see how we can download and install scene builder and then we will configure scene builder with IntelliJ IDEA so just open your favorite browser and search for java vaccine builder and the strangely oracle doesn't support scene builder anymore so if you want our latest version of scene builder you need to go to a website called gluon hq.com which is this one okay so you don't need to go to oracle calm but go to drill one hq.com slash open slow slash C in Builder which is this option okay so just click this option and in here you can see this would glue on website and in here you can see the download now button so you just need to click download now and you can see different options here so the one we are interested in is this option which is for Windows x64 which is for windows 64bit operating system which is this third option so you just need to click this download button and once this executable file will be downloaded you just need to run the executable file it's not you know very complicated to install it you just need to click some Next button and it will be installed but after installing it the step after installing is important so once you have installed this scene builder on your Windows operating system there is a fixed path in which it's installed by default and this part we are going to see right now so just open your folder Explorer and in here go to C Drive here and the C Drive go to users and the users go to your computer name in my case my computer name is programming knowledge in your case this will be your name or whatever your computer name is so I'm going to click this and in here I am going to go inside the app data folder okay so a gap data folder and inside the app data I have this local folder inside the local folder I will be able to find this scene builder folder okay so once you download and install the scene builder it will be you know located at this location so go to this location I am going to just paste this part in the description also so that you don't forget it okay so go to this path until local and then if you see scene builder after installing scene builder just select this and cut it from here so I'm going to just select it and cut this folder from here and I'm going to paste it in my C Drive so I will just go to my C Drive and in here I'm going to paste it okay so why I'm doing this because it's a simple path which I can remember and it's not really complicated right so now I have the scene builder folder in my C Drive right and when I open it it has this scene builder dot exe file okay so once you have the scene builder dot exe file here we are ready to you know provide the part Oh of this folder in the IntelliJ IDEA so I'm going to minimize everything and in the IntelliJ IDEA first of all maybe I can copy this part and the IntelliJ IDEA just open your sample of XML file I'm going to minimize this also and in the sample dot F XML file here I'm going to just choose the scene builder option and then I will click path here okay and then in here I will be able to find the path of my scene builder folder so let's see where it is so here it is right so I just click this scene builder here and then just choose the executable file for the scene builder which is this one okay so choose scene builder dot exe from here inside the scene builder and then click OK and once you click OK it's going to configure scene builder here and then you can see our sample dot effects a new file is shown in the scene builder you know design of you ok so I'm going to just maximize it so that we can see it better and right now it doesn't have anything so right now we can see there is a grid pane here but it doesn't have the size and width here so you can go to the layout property here you can see and in the layout property there is a prep width and prep height which you can change so you can just give the prep width for example 300 and pref height is equal to 300 year and press Enter and now you can see some kind of grid pain here ok and when you save it and go to the text view you will be able to see here pref width is set to 300 and pref height is set to 300 here okay so whatever you change in the designer it's going to be implemented in this F XML file also okay so what we are going to do now is we are going to take a button so we will go to controls option here and the first option here in control says button so we are going to drag and drop this button in the grid pane and you can just resize it and now what we are going to do is we want to click this button and we want to perform some action right so what we will do now is we are going to you know write some code in the controller class in order to you know you know execute the button press event okay so when you go to the text option here and the sample dot F XML file when you just scroll it on the right hand side you can see our controller class is sample dot controller right so by default it's simple dot controller which is this class which is automatically created for us so we will go to the controller class and inside the controller class we will just create a method for example public void for example press button and it's going to take one argument which is action event so just write action event okay and just write the name of your argument for example event itself and then we are going to execute some code inside this method so for simplicity I'm going to just print something for example I'm going to just write s out and press the tab button which is going to generate this code for me for printing some line so print line and then I am going to just write hello okay so I'm going to pray hello world whenever somebody presses this button and now save this code and then go to your sample dot F XML file here and then go to the scene builder here and in the scene builder go at the right bottom and here you will be able to see this code so just click code here and in the code you will be able to find this FX ID so in the controller first of all we need to define this FX ID for the button right so what we are going to do next a we can give some ID to our button here so for example BTN MSG for message button message write msg it's not necessary for this step but later whenever you you know put some label or some other component here or widget here you may have to give the FX ID for that and then you need to define that FX ID in your controller but for now we just want to you know perform the button action method so what we can do right now is we can go to just select first of all this button here and make sure you have given this button message or any ID to your button and then in on action you know category here you will be able to find your method you have defined which is press button right so we have defined this press button method here you see we have just defined this method so as soon as you save your code you will be able to see this when you drag and drop here button press ok so this is the same method which we have defined in the controller okay and give the FX ID also right and then save your code and now we are going to run code okay so let's run the code and let's see what happens from now so right now it's showing me some errors so let's see what the error is so I can see here the error here is error resolving on action press button either the event handler is not the namespace or there is error in the script right so when I open this controller dot Java class here in the import by default it takes the action event class from AWT which we don't want right we want the class from the JavaFX right so instead of this Java dot aw t dot event dot action event we want this option which is Java FX dot event dot action event we want this action event class not the aw T action event class and that's why this error was you know given to us so by default it was taking the aw T action event class right so just correct this input and then save it once again and we are going to run it once again and hopefully the error will be gone this time so now our you know window is open and when I click this button hopefully we will be able to see hello world here also so I will click the button and you can see hello world is printed once again hello a world is printed when I click the button right so this is fairly simple okay so in this way you can create your first Java FX project in IntelliJ IDEA using the scene builder so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
