00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:04 - we can use life of returning slack
00:07 - statement and how we can use bulk are
00:10 - with it to provide the condition okay so
00:15 - let us first understand the syntax and
00:18 - what are deep and cuts okay so we are
00:26 - going to use like of data and basically
00:30 - we have two white cars
00:37 - the first one is percentage and the
00:44 - second one is underscore percentage and
00:50 - underscore are two wildcards that
00:52 - provides by SQL so what are therefore
00:58 - okay basically percentage sign is
01:03 - indicates the multi per character zero
01:06 - for multiple characters while the
01:09 - underscore represent only one character
01:11 - you can understand it much better if I
01:17 - show you an example okay let us open
01:23 - terminal all right psql okay so let us
01:33 - see which are up three databases present
01:36 - in our system for that write X plus L so
01:42 - here you can see we have test database
01:44 - for connecting that test database we are
01:47 - going to use
01:48 - wexel XP for connecting any name of the
01:51 - database steps so we are connected to
01:55 - test database now let us see which are
01:57 - the tables present in our system so we
02:01 - have employee table mobile table and
02:04 - stable let us first see which are the
02:09 - data present in our student table
02:13 - delay start so student we have five rows
02:21 - roll number and name is the column now
02:25 - what if I want the student whose name
02:29 - starts with character be okay so I will
02:36 - write like this select write the column
02:47 - and we are going to use the like comment
02:50 - like and then we use white cards okay
02:54 - like the first character must be
02:58 - alphabet B okay so I write E and the
03:04 - rest of the character can be anything so
03:07 - I want to specify the multiple character
03:11 - here
03:11 - so I write percentage okay Tammy : you
03:19 - can see there are total to students
03:21 - whose name starts with character b3
03:24 - chain and go so we get two rows let us
03:31 - consider one more example I want to
03:35 - select the student whose first character
03:41 - can be anything but the last character
03:46 - must be a okay so first character can be
03:52 - anything and the last character will be
03:58 - a okay so last character must be a and
04:05 - the rest of the characters can be
04:08 - anything so we got two rows Julia Andrea
04:15 - let us try to use underscore operator
04:21 - now I want to find out the student whose
04:26 - name has only three characters okay
04:30 - only three characters so I write
04:34 - I'll just wanted to present one
04:37 - character second underscore and further
04:40 - that the prison three character as you
04:43 - can see we are getting born as the
04:46 - results because Bob is no mister whose
04:49 - name consists of three characters only
04:53 - okay so this is how we can you buy the
04:58 - arts it's like operator so let me just
05:02 - close these and okay jaimé in this
05:08 - database query to okay so now we are
05:14 - considering the second level which is
05:16 - employee table so it has basically four
05:29 - rows as you can see we are getting only
05:33 - one row because only this employee is
05:37 - satisfied the condition okay apart from
05:44 - the name or student name that is worker
05:49 - type data you can also use like of
05:53 - record with integer datatype okay so for
05:59 - that we are going to use to run table so
06:06 - we have five rows now I want to select
06:09 - disturbin we're like let's say if
06:25 - first number can be anything but last
06:29 - number must be three okay so four
06:34 - seconds represent multiple numbers and
06:36 - the last digit is 3 so the last digit
06:41 - must be C now I cannot use the syntax it
06:47 - will give me an error as you can see
06:49 - because like operator is by default to
06:54 - work with the text or we're kinda tight
06:57 - so I have to explicitly time kostik with
07:03 - text and you can see the last digit is 3
07:08 - and the rest of is can be anything I can
07:13 - also modify this the first digit must be
07:17 - 1 the meters can be anything and let me
07:21 - just write out the spot ok as you can
07:24 - see so basically this is how you can use
07:34 - Python 15 like operator to improvise
07:38 - your search result thanks for watching
07:40 - it

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see how we can use life of returning slack statement and how we can use bulk are with it to provide the condition okay so let us first understand the syntax and what are deep and cuts okay so we are going to use like of data and basically we have two white cars the first one is percentage and the second one is underscore percentage and underscore are two wildcards that provides by SQL so what are therefore okay basically percentage sign is indicates the multi per character zero for multiple characters while the underscore represent only one character you can understand it much better if I show you an example okay let us open terminal all right psql okay so let us see which are up three databases present in our system for that write X plus L so here you can see we have test database for connecting that test database we are going to use wexel XP for connecting any name of the database steps so we are connected to test database now let us see which are the tables present in our system so we have employee table mobile table and stable let us first see which are the data present in our student table delay start so student we have five rows roll number and name is the column now what if I want the student whose name starts with character be okay so I will write like this select write the column and we are going to use the like comment like and then we use white cards okay like the first character must be alphabet B okay so I write E and the rest of the character can be anything so I want to specify the multiple character here so I write percentage okay Tammy you can see there are total to students whose name starts with character b3 chain and go so we get two rows let us consider one more example I want to select the student whose first character can be anything but the last character must be a okay so first character can be anything and the last character will be a okay so last character must be a and the rest of the characters can be anything so we got two rows Julia Andrea let us try to use underscore operator now I want to find out the student whose name has only three characters okay only three characters so I write I'll just wanted to present one character second underscore and further that the prison three character as you can see we are getting born as the results because Bob is no mister whose name consists of three characters only okay so this is how we can you buy the arts it's like operator so let me just close these and okay jaimé in this database query to okay so now we are considering the second level which is employee table so it has basically four rows as you can see we are getting only one row because only this employee is satisfied the condition okay apart from the name or student name that is worker type data you can also use like of record with integer datatype okay so for that we are going to use to run table so we have five rows now I want to select disturbin we're like let's say if first number can be anything but last number must be three okay so four seconds represent multiple numbers and the last digit is 3 so the last digit must be C now I cannot use the syntax it will give me an error as you can see because like operator is by default to work with the text or we're kinda tight so I have to explicitly time kostik with text and you can see the last digit is 3 and the rest of is can be anything I can also modify this the first digit must be 1 the meters can be anything and let me just write out the spot ok as you can see so basically this is how you can use Python 15 like operator to improvise your search result thanks for watching it
