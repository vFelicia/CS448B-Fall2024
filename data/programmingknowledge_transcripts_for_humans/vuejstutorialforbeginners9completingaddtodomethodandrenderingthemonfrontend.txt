00:00 - hello everyone welcome to the tutorial
00:02 - number nine
00:04 - so i can welcome you all to tutorial
00:05 - number nine so let's get started with
00:07 - this tutorial
00:08 - so this is the link github.com pro
00:11 - software development
00:12 - and under this link the slash learn view
00:15 - you will get all the files related to
00:17 - the previous tutorial so let's get
00:19 - started with today's tutorial
00:21 - so title is the video is completing our
00:23 - to-do method and rendering them on
00:25 - front-end
00:26 - we will submit the data to the form and
00:28 - store them inside the json array
00:30 - so let's get start to this tutorial so
00:33 - like this is a continuation to the
00:34 - previous tutorial and we will complete
00:36 - the active do method
00:38 - so let's get started with this okay
00:42 - i told we had created the method method
00:44 - add to do
00:45 - and this was a title so we need to bind
00:48 - this
00:49 - title with the to do text for your
00:51 - simplicity what we can do
00:53 - we can copy this and let this instead of
00:57 - to do title let this be as a to-do text
01:01 - so i hope this this is a pretty much
01:03 - good idea
01:04 - so this would keep the things same now
01:07 - to bind them
01:08 - we need to use a functionality that is v
01:10 - model so v model
01:13 - is going to bind them and i have
01:15 - discussed earlier what is the model and
01:17 - i will give you the idea
01:19 - of the same right now also so like we
01:22 - need to bind them
01:24 - using v model that is v model
01:29 - is is equal to to do text
01:33 - okay and just for the simplicity what we
01:36 - can do
01:39 - we can type okay first i'll okay first
01:42 - i'll refresh the page
01:43 - so i'll show you that this has been
01:45 - binded so let me
01:47 - refresh the page okay
01:50 - yeah so let's get to this video
01:54 - the refresh page this is script started
01:57 - now what we can do we can bind this
02:00 - and for the simplicity i can do one
02:02 - thing
02:04 - i can add a paragraph
02:08 - and i can now
02:11 - you typed typing
02:17 - this this is dot and we can add a typing
02:20 - to do text
02:24 - so what i'm going to show
02:27 - is this to do text has been binded
02:30 - with a js file that is this thing due to
02:33 - text
02:34 - which is empty so typing to
02:37 - text and this will be model so let's
02:39 - refresh this
02:41 - and i'll as soon as i type something you
02:43 - can see
02:44 - here live changes come here okay
02:47 - so so this is how when i have i have
02:50 - binded this
02:52 - and typing to do text and
02:55 - i'll type do do text
02:59 - help me something like this and you can
03:02 - see that this has been binded
03:04 - now to submit the form we would create a
03:08 - submit action
03:09 - and before that what we can do
03:12 - is like i'll show you one thing
03:16 - this the method uh
03:21 - the like since this is uh
03:24 - what you can do you can do autocomplete
03:29 - is it off and we need to define
03:33 - a add that it submit i did it submit
03:38 - dot prevent so this is like to prevent
03:41 - is to use to like
03:42 - uh prevent the default action so this at
03:45 - the rate submit dot prevent is able to
03:48 - add to do
03:50 - okay i hope this is fine
03:53 - and i'll add add to do option here
03:57 - add to do okay
04:01 - now before i do something else first
04:03 - i'll do
04:04 - console dot log
04:09 - and i'll type
04:13 - submit okay
04:16 - submit it okay and this is to ensure
04:19 - that this has been submitted
04:21 - so let's refresh this page i'm inside my
04:23 - console
04:25 - and it's taking a oh yeah so typing is
04:29 - working perfectly fine so this is this
04:31 - let me type submitted
04:33 - again digital submitted twice
04:36 - i hope you can see this number two and
04:38 - this is this
04:40 - three four five six so it's being
04:42 - submitted so this is perfectly fine
04:44 - so this is i wanted to show you that the
04:47 - submit method has been called
04:48 - and now what we can do
04:52 - the first thing we need to do is we need
04:54 - to
04:55 - uh build a good logic so how we ensure
04:57 - the functionality
04:59 - and for the for the same what we can do
05:03 - uh so here you can see as we
05:06 - hit the submit button the counter keeps
05:08 - on working keeps on going
05:10 - so we need to ensure the same in the act
05:12 - add to do method
05:14 - okay so uh
05:18 - so let's do one thing and let's
05:22 - yeah so
05:26 - we can do method
05:30 - so let to do
05:34 - is equal to json object this dot id
05:38 - okay so this dot id
05:42 - and what i can do one thing i'll do one
05:45 - thing that
05:46 - id is equal to this dot id
05:50 - perfectly fine and
05:55 - title okay
05:59 - since we remove title so two root text
06:01 - was the name for that to root text
06:04 - is called this dot
06:07 - this dot to do text
06:11 - perfectly fine now done
06:18 - is equal to this dot
06:22 - done and we can add
06:29 - console dot log
06:35 - to do okay so let's
06:39 - first add something okay
06:44 - learn view so this is my first to do
06:47 - so this object has been created object
06:49 - done is usually false id is good
06:51 - one due to text is good to learn view
06:54 - let's do one thing another add learn
06:57 - react
06:59 - so this is object with the id one done
07:02 - false
07:03 - to do text learn react so let me do
07:05 - another learn
07:07 - angular
07:10 - so here you can see object id is one
07:13 - done is false and to do texas learn
07:15 - angular so one thing we observe
07:17 - now for that as soon as we add a to do
07:20 - the id id is not increased
07:24 - okay so we need to ensure
07:27 - that something like we need to ensure
07:30 - that this id makes a
07:32 - the id is uh like the id gets a new
07:36 - thing and then we can make sure that we
07:39 - are perfectly working fine with that
07:41 - okay so let's
07:46 - okay yeah so let's create a reset method
07:50 - so which will make ensure that we
07:53 - our method works perfectly fine so let's
07:56 - create a method
07:57 - reset okay
08:00 - and let's
08:04 - yeah so we need to add a comma tag
08:10 - so this would do this dot id
08:15 - plus plus this
08:19 - dot title okay this dot
08:22 - text is equal to null another string
08:27 - and this dot done
08:31 - is equal to false
08:35 - so because we need to just i'm just sort
08:38 - of
08:38 - this like this is the mandatory part
08:41 - these two are optional but just for the
08:42 - simplicity and the like
08:44 - we don't keep a bug so i i mean do like
08:48 - after like i'll now explain this
08:50 - console. to do
08:54 - this now added to do this
08:57 - dot to do's dot push
09:01 - to do okay so
09:04 - i wanted to show you one thing now i'll
09:06 - call
09:07 - this dot reset
09:12 - okay so okay if this looks
09:16 - something confusing so i'll do
09:21 - i'll change this to increment id
09:23 - increment
09:25 - id okay and
09:30 - okay let this be reset okay this looks
09:32 - perfectly fine
09:33 - okay now what i do let together is equal
09:36 - to ids with this dot id to do text is
09:38 - desktop two root text and then you will
09:40 - go to this dot done
09:42 - i print this to do i add this to do
09:45 - in the ra i store it in an array then i
09:48 - call the reset function
09:50 - and what does this reset function do
09:52 - let's increment the id
09:54 - and changes the to-do text to default
09:56 - state and this dot done is marked as
09:58 - fall
09:58 - so i'll show you one thing now i refresh
10:02 - the page
10:03 - now i'll add something add my to-do and
10:05 - you see
10:06 - as soon as i added to do the this text
10:09 - box becomes empty
10:11 - which was not happening earlier the text
10:13 - box didn't become empty after adding a
10:16 - to-do
10:16 - and i did increment so learn react
10:21 - this id2 text box will contain empty
10:24 - learn learn angular
10:28 - and i had to do text box becomes and
10:32 - text box becomes empty and the id
10:35 - becomes free
10:36 - so i'll do learn python
10:42 - id becomes four and then python and
10:45 - learn
10:47 - learn js so this id becomes 5 and launch
10:51 - here
10:51 - so we will continue in the next tutorial
10:54 - thank you for watching this tutorial
10:56 - so thank you so much and we will learn
10:59 - how to render them on front end
11:01 - in the next tutorial thank you so much

root text is called this dot this dot to do text perfectly fine now done is equal to this dot done and we can add console dot log to do okay so let's first add something okay learn view so this is my first to do so this object has been created object done is usually false id is good one due to text is good to learn view let's do one thing another add learn react so this is object with the id one done false to do text learn react so let me do another learn angular so here you can see object id is one done is false and to do texas learn angular so one thing we observe now for that as soon as we add a to do the id id is not increased okay so we need to ensure that something like we need to ensure that this id makes a the id is uh like the id gets a new thing and then we can make sure that we
