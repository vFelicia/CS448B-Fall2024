00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to install python on your Ubuntu
00:06 - operating system so I want to install
00:09 - latest version of python on my UB 2
00:12 - operating system so I open my browser
00:16 - and I type in here
00:24 - www.
00:25 - python.org
00:28 - and
00:30 - and it opens the
00:34 - website and here I will go to the
00:38 - download section so I will click
00:45 - download and here all the versions of
00:48 - downloads are
00:50 - available so when you first come to this
00:54 - page here at the time of making this
00:58 - video the version 3.3 is the latest
01:02 - version but there is a small note here
01:05 - that if you don't know which version uh
01:08 - to use tripath Python
01:11 - 3.3 and some of third party software is
01:14 - not yet compatible with Python 3 so if
01:19 - you want to um uh use some third party
01:23 - uh software with python then uh they
01:27 - prefer to
01:28 - use 2.7 version but right now I want to
01:32 - install latest version of python so I
01:35 - will install python
01:37 - 3.3 so in here I will search for the
01:41 - tarball for
01:43 - Linux and I will choose
01:48 - this ZIP file to install on my
01:52 - system and I will save
01:57 - it and it's downloading
02:00 - it may take some seconds to
02:09 - download now once your python tar file
02:14 - is downloaded I will double click
02:17 - it and open this
02:21 - file in the archive
02:24 - manager you can do it with uh this
02:27 - terminal also everything
02:30 - but right now I'm showing it the very
02:33 - easiest way to do that so this is my
02:37 - python file I will extract it to my
02:41 - desired location for example to my home
02:44 - path or wherever you would like to
02:48 - extract this uh python zip file so I
02:52 - will go to my home file and I will
02:56 - extract it
02:58 - here
03:00 - let me make it little bit smaller so I
03:04 - will go to my home and
03:09 - extract and it's
03:22 - extracting so once your part python zip
03:25 - file is extracted it will look like this
03:28 - for version
03:32 - 3.3.2 and I have all the configuration
03:35 - files here so let me close this uh
03:39 - extraction file and now I will open the
03:43 - terminal
03:46 - and I will search for my python file so
03:51 - here I have all the things and then I
03:57 - can see my python file here so so I will
04:00 - write
04:03 - CD
04:05 - Python and yeah I have all the
04:09 - configuration
04:10 - files which is there in the python so I
04:13 - will just write dot
04:22 - slash
04:24 - configure and press
04:27 - enter it will configure python on my
04:42 - system if you are installing python on a
04:46 - freshly installed Ubuntu operating
04:49 - system and you
04:51 - haven't uh till now installed any of the
04:55 - build essential library then go ahead go
04:59 - and install those build essential and
05:02 - eslite Library first otherwise it will
05:05 - not
05:06 - support skite library or it may create
05:10 - some problem to compile these python
05:13 - configuration file so the prerequisite
05:17 - for uh installing python is I will show
05:21 - you while it's
05:22 - configuring so I will open a new
05:28 - tab
05:30 - and it's right now installing and I will
05:33 - I have opened the new tab and the
05:36 - prerequisite of
05:38 - U uh python file is this you need to
05:44 - install build essential first before
05:47 - configuring this python file so write
05:50 - sud sudo
05:52 - apt-get install build essential so I
05:56 - have already uh done that so
06:00 - uh I don't need to uh repeat this uh
06:02 - step once again but if you haven't done
06:05 - this then uh you need to do this and the
06:08 - second thing
06:10 - is in order to python to have support
06:13 - for escalate you need to
06:17 - install these escolite Dev Library so
06:21 - write pseudo
06:23 - apt-get install lib escal
06:27 - 3- Dave this also I have already done
06:31 - but if you have freshly installed Ubuntu
06:35 - then just install this also so just give
06:39 - the command and press enter and it will
06:42 - install this uh
06:44 - escolite when you are open to also the
06:47 - third prerequisite is you should also
06:51 - have
06:54 - installed this live bz 2 Das Dev Library
07:00 - so go ahead and type on your terminal
07:03 - Pudo
07:04 - apt-get install lip bz2 dasd library and
07:10 - press enter in order to uh install this
07:13 - library and it will ask for your
07:16 - password and it will install in your
07:19 - system this
07:21 - Library so if you haven't done that you
07:25 - you can see here zero upgraded one newly
07:28 - installed
07:30 - um Library
07:34 - here so these are the some of the basic
07:38 - prerequisite of uh uh configuring or or
07:42 - making installing python on your system
07:46 - so if you haven't done that just do this
07:49 - and
07:50 - then in the other tab my configuration
07:54 - is already done so I will make my files
07:59 - or configuration so I will write make
08:03 - this is I'm doing in this python library
08:07 - or python folder so my configuration is
08:11 - done so earlier I have uh provided this
08:15 - uh command do/ configure and now I'm
08:19 - providing this make command so press
08:22 - enter and it will make all the python
08:28 - libraries
08:31 - this make can take few minutes depending
08:34 - upon the speed of your operating
08:39 - system so now our make is done then we
08:42 - will provide the make installed command
08:45 - so write
08:48 - pseudo
08:50 - make
08:54 - alt install so right this command sud
08:58 - sudo make alt install and press enter
09:02 - give your
09:03 - password of your uben 2 operating system
09:07 - and it will start
09:08 - making and installing the python on your
09:17 - system so our install is complete now
09:20 - and uh the python is install in uh the
09:24 - live in the
09:26 - folder I will show you where python is
09:29 - installed in my Ubuntu operating system
09:33 - so what I have done is if I if you don't
09:36 - find python by default so for example I
09:41 - go to my home in the terminal and I
09:47 - print python here and here it will show
09:52 - it's showing me the version
09:55 - 2.7.3 which I have earlier installed and
09:59 - I don't want to use this older
10:02 - version right now so what I can do is I
10:06 - will
10:08 - write quit
10:10 - here and I will go to my UB to folder
10:16 - search or search and by default I think
10:20 - it will install this python 3.3
10:24 - version here in the user local bin
10:29 - folder okay so you will be able to find
10:33 - this python 3.3 in the user local bin
10:37 - folder so if you want
10:40 - to inst if you want to use latest
10:44 - version of python then don't write
10:47 - python alone just
10:50 - write python
10:55 - 3.3 it's not 3.3 but 3. three okay
11:01 - because latest version which is
11:02 - installed in our system is python 3.3
11:05 - you can see here so when you write this
11:10 - and press enter then you will be able to
11:13 - see python version 3.3 is working now on
11:17 - your system right let's check whether
11:21 - it's working or not so I will
11:23 - write
11:24 - [Music]
11:26 - print and I'll write
11:33 - hello world and press
11:37 - enter uh it's giving me some syntax
11:41 - let's
11:43 - see okay so I should provide these
11:46 - bracket like this press enter and now it
11:50 - prints hello world in my python so in
11:55 - this way you can configure and install
11:57 - latest version of python
12:00 - library right now till at the time of
12:03 - making this video it's
12:05 - 3.3 it it's the same procedure for all
12:08 - other latest versions so I hope you have
12:10 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
12:13 - and subscribe and bye for

python by default so for example I go to my home in the terminal and I print python here and here it will show it's showing me the version 2.7.3 which I have earlier installed and I don't want to use
