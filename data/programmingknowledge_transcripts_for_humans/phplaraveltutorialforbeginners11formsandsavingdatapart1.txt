00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - particular video this is the part number
00:06 - 11 of our laravel tutorial for beginners
00:09 - series and in this video we're going to
00:11 - discuss forms and how to save data and
00:15 - if you try to go to the correct or PK
00:21 - project that LOC create and then you can
00:24 - see that we have a 404 not found because
00:29 - it is loading the create function of our
00:33 - post controller and as you can see we
00:36 - don't have any logic from here yet so
00:39 - all we have to do now is modify this
00:42 - function and to actually return a view
00:46 - so this should return a view coming from
00:49 - our post directory and create template
00:55 - and let's go ahead and and create that
00:59 - inside our post directory so new file
01:04 - and of course the name of our template
01:09 - is create blade great blade that PHP and
01:14 - then we're just going to copy the
01:18 - mark-up from this index that laid that
01:21 - PHP and paste it here and it should say
01:25 - create post instead of just saying post
01:32 - and then we're going to get rid of all
01:35 - this markup here because we're going to
01:39 - use a form for us to save information
01:44 - coming from a form into our database
01:48 - and for now let us save this and try to
01:52 - preview in our browser so refresh so as
01:57 - you can see we still have the peak a
01:59 - project that LOC create and we're
02:02 - getting a 404 not found that's because I
02:07 - think we need to specify first the post
02:11 - here
02:13 - before they create so post and then
02:16 - create and there you see the create post
02:20 - h1 that we have added in or create that
02:24 - plate that page we find so let's try to
02:26 - add a form into this page and we're
02:32 - going to use laravel collective for that
02:34 - so they have a some sort of a template
02:36 - for forms and we just need to install
02:40 - and add some dependencies into our
02:43 - project so we can see here HTML so
02:49 - laravel collective and we can also open
02:56 - up their website laravel collective and
02:58 - here we can see the different versions
03:02 - so for example 6.0 so installation for
03:07 - the lateral collective is here so
03:12 - composer require laravel collective /
03:15 - HTML so we're going to do that in our
03:18 - code editor Adam and we're going to open
03:22 - up the integrate the terminal from more
03:27 - code editor Adam and then paste just the
03:30 - composer required laravel collective so
03:34 - there you go and then enter we're just
03:37 - going to wait for a few seconds and now
03:40 - the installation is complete let's go
03:42 - back to the website and in here we have
03:44 - a guide on how to open up a form inside
03:50 - inside our template so we have here
03:53 - opening our form and then we can just
03:55 - copy and paste this one and paste it in
03:59 - our create that blade PHP so below here
04:04 - let's just paste this code and try to
04:10 - change this in because this is how the
04:14 - default on how to open up a form by
04:17 - specifying the URL and where to submit
04:21 - the data coming from this form but we
04:23 - can actually change this so in here
04:26 - we're going
04:27 - to specify the action instead of the URL
04:31 - so the action for this one is post
04:37 - controller and then add symbol and of
04:42 - course the store function inside our
04:45 - post controller class and we can also
04:48 - specify the method from here so it
04:51 - should be method and of course method
04:55 - with single code and the equal and
04:59 - greater than sign and here we specify
05:02 - the method which is post also in here we
05:06 - can specify a division with a class form
05:13 - group so this is actually coming from a
05:15 - bootstrap so we can also add a form
05:19 - label here so this will be form and then
05:23 - label and specifying that this is a
05:29 - label for our title and the actual label
05:36 - of our title field and of course we can
05:40 - also specify here the actual input so
05:42 - form and then tax we can specify the
05:47 - name of our input which is title and
05:51 - then the value so this is a create form
05:58 - so we should not specify a default value
06:02 - and of course we can also specify
06:06 - classes here or additional attributes so
06:10 - for classes or for classes for this
06:14 - particular input and this should have a
06:21 - class form control and of course a
06:25 - placeholder for this particular input so
06:31 - equal sign and then greater than and the
06:36 - actual placeholder which is title
06:39 - so let's try to save this for now and
06:41 - let's go back to our browser to preview
06:44 - and try to see here we have the actual
06:53 - label an input field which has the
06:58 - placeholder title but I think we don't
07:01 - have yet the correct classes for our
07:04 - input so it looks ugly for now so let's
07:08 - go back to our code editor and try to
07:10 - see so we have here instead of class we
07:15 - have specified classes so save that and
07:18 - try to refresh and there you go we have
07:22 - a much much better input for our title
07:27 - and then we can also the same or we can
07:31 - also do the same for our body so we're
07:35 - just going to copy this and instead of
07:37 - title we're going to say body and of
07:41 - course this is for body also and by d2
07:47 - and so with this placeholder and of
07:53 - course instead of tax or using tax it
07:56 - should be taxed area there you go and
08:00 - save that can refresh our page
08:03 - so we have a title and a body now and
08:07 - the last part is to add a submit button
08:10 - for our form so before the closing tag
08:14 - of our form let's add the button submit
08:18 - which is form and then submit and of
08:22 - course we need to specify some values
08:24 - here also so submit and then of course
08:28 - the class for our button which has class
08:33 - and then we can specify the BTN class
08:39 - with the N primary to signify that it is
08:42 - a button so save and refresh
08:49 - so now we have a complete form with all
08:53 - the fields and of course the submit
08:56 - button and if you try to submit now so
08:59 - it redirect to another page and
09:02 - basically we're not doing anything for
09:05 - now because we should modify also the
09:09 - store function of our post controller so
09:12 - let's go back first or code editor and
09:16 - edit our post controller so inside here
09:20 - I'm just going to close this real quick
09:22 - and in here we need to add some logic to
09:27 - actually save our data coming from the
09:29 - forum we can also add the validation
09:31 - from this function also so we can
09:35 - specify this and then the function
09:40 - validate and of course we need to have
09:44 - the request here and also the area of
09:49 - the rules which as for our title it
09:53 - should be required okay so it should be
09:58 - required and also the body tag or the
10:01 - body or the body of our post should be
10:04 - also required so and then we're just
10:10 - going to return a number for now so 143
10:15 - something like that save this and go
10:17 - back to our browser refresh and then try
10:21 - to submit so it is not allowing us to
10:24 - submit or any data because air is empty
10:27 - for now so but we don't have a message
10:31 - that it it is submitting an empty
10:34 - information but if we try to have an
10:38 - information here and then submit so as
10:42 - you can see we now have the return
10:44 - information 1 for 3
10:47 - so I think this video is rather long so
10:50 - we're going to continue working on with
10:52 - this forms and how to save data in the
10:55 - next video and I hope you learned
10:57 - something from this video and see you in
10:59 - the next video thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this particular video this is the part number 11 of our laravel tutorial for beginners series and in this video we're going to discuss forms and how to save data and if you try to go to the correct or PK project that LOC create and then you can see that we have a 404 not found because it is loading the create function of our post controller and as you can see we don't have any logic from here yet so all we have to do now is modify this function and to actually return a view so this should return a view coming from our post directory and create template and let's go ahead and and create that inside our post directory so new file and of course the name of our template is create blade great blade that PHP and then we're just going to copy the markup from this index that laid that PHP and paste it here and it should say create post instead of just saying post and then we're going to get rid of all this markup here because we're going to use a form for us to save information coming from a form into our database and for now let us save this and try to preview in our browser so refresh so as you can see we still have the peak a project that LOC create and we're getting a 404 not found that's because I think we need to specify first the post here before they create so post and then create and there you see the create post h1 that we have added in or create that plate that page we find so let's try to add a form into this page and we're going to use laravel collective for that so they have a some sort of a template for forms and we just need to install and add some dependencies into our project so we can see here HTML so laravel collective and we can also open up their website laravel collective and here we can see the different versions so for example 6.0 so installation for the lateral collective is here so composer require laravel collective / HTML so we're going to do that in our code editor Adam and we're going to open up the integrate the terminal from more code editor Adam and then paste just the composer required laravel collective so there you go and then enter we're just going to wait for a few seconds and now the installation is complete let's go back to the website and in here we have a guide on how to open up a form inside inside our template so we have here opening our form and then we can just copy and paste this one and paste it in our create that blade PHP so below here let's just paste this code and try to change this in because this is how the default on how to open up a form by specifying the URL and where to submit the data coming from this form but we can actually change this so in here we're going to specify the action instead of the URL so the action for this one is post controller and then add symbol and of course the store function inside our post controller class and we can also specify the method from here so it should be method and of course method with single code and the equal and greater than sign and here we specify the method which is post also in here we can specify a division with a class form group so this is actually coming from a bootstrap so we can also add a form label here so this will be form and then label and specifying that this is a label for our title and the actual label of our title field and of course we can also specify here the actual input so form and then tax we can specify the name of our input which is title and then the value so this is a create form so we should not specify a default value and of course we can also specify classes here or additional attributes so for classes or for classes for this particular input and this should have a class form control and of course a placeholder for this particular input so equal sign and then greater than and the actual placeholder which is title so let's try to save this for now and let's go back to our browser to preview and try to see here we have the actual label an input field which has the placeholder title but I think we don't have yet the correct classes for our input so it looks ugly for now so let's go back to our code editor and try to see so we have here instead of class we have specified classes so save that and try to refresh and there you go we have a much much better input for our title and then we can also the same or we can also do the same for our body so we're just going to copy this and instead of title we're going to say body and of course this is for body also and by d2 and so with this placeholder and of course instead of tax or using tax it should be taxed area there you go and save that can refresh our page so we have a title and a body now and the last part is to add a submit button for our form so before the closing tag of our form let's add the button submit which is form and then submit and of course we need to specify some values here also so submit and then of course the class for our button which has class and then we can specify the BTN class with the N primary to signify that it is a button so save and refresh so now we have a complete form with all the fields and of course the submit button and if you try to submit now so it redirect to another page and basically we're not doing anything for now because we should modify also the store function of our post controller so let's go back first or code editor and edit our post controller so inside here I'm just going to close this real quick and in here we need to add some logic to actually save our data coming from the forum we can also add the validation from this function also so we can specify this and then the function validate and of course we need to have the request here and also the area of the rules which as for our title it should be required okay so it should be required and also the body tag or the body or the body of our post should be also required so and then we're just going to return a number for now so 143 something like that save this and go back to our browser refresh and then try to submit so it is not allowing us to submit or any data because air is empty for now so but we don't have a message that it it is submitting an empty information but if we try to have an information here and then submit so as you can see we now have the return information 1 for 3 so I think this video is rather long so we're going to continue working on with this forms and how to save data in the next video and I hope you learned something from this video and see you in the next video thanks
