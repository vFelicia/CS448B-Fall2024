00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in the
00:03 - last video we have seen how to raise an
00:06 - exception in python using this raised
00:09 - keyboard and we have seen how to raise
00:13 - an exception using the base class which
00:16 - is exception or the subclasses of this
00:18 - exception class for example the value
00:21 - error or any other error which is the
00:23 - subclass of this exception now in this
00:27 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:28 - create your custom exception classes and
00:32 - use them to raise exception in Python so
00:36 - let's get started so I'm going to create
00:38 - a custom exception class here so let me
00:42 - create a class and I'm going to name it
00:44 - as coffee too hot exception and to
00:48 - create your own custom exception class
00:51 - you need to inherit from the exception
00:54 - class so you just need to provide
00:56 - exception as the superclass inside the
01:00 - parentheses and then after the colon you
01:03 - can just define the init method to
01:06 - provide the message so it takes one
01:09 - argument for example msg which stands
01:13 - for message and now what we need to do
01:15 - is we need to pass this message to the
01:19 - constructor of this exception class and
01:22 - how to do that you can do that using the
01:25 - super function so you can use super and
01:28 - then call the init function here which
01:32 - means we are calling the init method of
01:34 - this exception class using this super
01:38 - function and we just need to pass the
01:41 - message which comes as an argument of
01:44 - your custom exception class to the super
01:47 - class which is the exception class and
01:49 - that's your custom exception class now I
01:53 - can pass this class instead of this base
01:57 - exception class similarly to create the
02:01 - coffee too cold class I can once again
02:05 - write coffee to cold here and instead of
02:08 - using the subclass of exception I can
02:11 - give here my own
02:13 - custom exception class so let's run this
02:16 - program and let's see what happens
02:18 - so because right now the temperature
02:20 - which we have provided here is 10 which
02:22 - means this falls in this condition which
02:25 - says coffee too cold so we are seeing
02:29 - this exception which says coffee too
02:32 - cold and then it's going to show us this
02:35 - message which says coffee too cold now
02:37 - we have made this exception class
02:39 - explanatory enough so that we don't
02:42 - require this coffee too cold message
02:45 - instead of this coffee too cold message
02:47 - we can give some more information for
02:50 - the user for example we can write here
02:53 - coffee temperature and then we can
02:56 - provide the information of the coffee
02:59 - temperature which the user has provided
03:01 - so self dot underscore underscore
03:04 - temperature and same we can provide in
03:08 - the coffee too hot exception message one
03:12 - more thing which we need to do here is
03:14 - we need to convert this temperature into
03:17 - a string so we can use this mastered STR
03:20 - to convert from the integer or the float
03:24 - value to the string value so this is
03:27 - just the typecasting from the integer to
03:31 - the string and now we are going to run
03:34 - our program and see what's the result
03:36 - here so you can see now the result says
03:39 - coffee too cold exception and then it
03:42 - shows the temperature which is provided
03:44 - by the user that suggests temperature we
03:47 - change from ten to hundred and once
03:49 - again run the code now it's going to say
03:52 - coffee too hot and it's going to display
03:55 - the temperature of coffee which is
03:57 - hundred here so let's rewind what we
04:00 - have learned about creating our own
04:03 - custom exception class so in order to
04:06 - create your own custom exception class
04:08 - you need to inherit from this exception
04:11 - base class or the superclass and then
04:14 - you can create any custom class with any
04:17 - name and for passing the message which
04:20 - you provide as the first argument of
04:22 - your exception you can just create an
04:26 - init method
04:27 - which takes this message and pass it to
04:29 - the init method of your superclass which
04:33 - is the exception class so this is how
04:36 - you can create your own custom exception
04:39 - classes and use them to raise the
04:41 - exception in Python I hope you have
04:44 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
04:47 - the next video
04:56 - you

hey guys welcome to the next video on Python tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how to raise an exception in python using this raised keyboard and we have seen how to raise an exception using the base class which is exception or the subclasses of this exception class for example the value error or any other error which is the subclass of this exception now in this video I'm going to show you how you can create your custom exception classes and use them to raise exception in Python so let's get started so I'm going to create a custom exception class here so let me create a class and I'm going to name it as coffee too hot exception and to create your own custom exception class you need to inherit from the exception class so you just need to provide exception as the superclass inside the parentheses and then after the colon you can just define the init method to provide the message so it takes one argument for example msg which stands for message and now what we need to do is we need to pass this message to the constructor of this exception class and how to do that you can do that using the super function so you can use super and then call the init function here which means we are calling the init method of this exception class using this super function and we just need to pass the message which comes as an argument of your custom exception class to the super class which is the exception class and that's your custom exception class now I can pass this class instead of this base exception class similarly to create the coffee too cold class I can once again write coffee to cold here and instead of using the subclass of exception I can give here my own custom exception class so let's run this program and let's see what happens so because right now the temperature which we have provided here is 10 which means this falls in this condition which says coffee too cold so we are seeing this exception which says coffee too cold and then it's going to show us this message which says coffee too cold now we have made this exception class explanatory enough so that we don't require this coffee too cold message instead of this coffee too cold message we can give some more information for the user for example we can write here coffee temperature and then we can provide the information of the coffee temperature which the user has provided so self dot underscore underscore temperature and same we can provide in the coffee too hot exception message one more thing which we need to do here is we need to convert this temperature into a string so we can use this mastered STR to convert from the integer or the float value to the string value so this is just the typecasting from the integer to the string and now we are going to run our program and see what's the result here so you can see now the result says coffee too cold exception and then it shows the temperature which is provided by the user that suggests temperature we change from ten to hundred and once again run the code now it's going to say coffee too hot and it's going to display the temperature of coffee which is hundred here so let's rewind what we have learned about creating our own custom exception class so in order to create your own custom exception class you need to inherit from this exception base class or the superclass and then you can create any custom class with any name and for passing the message which you provide as the first argument of your exception you can just create an init method which takes this message and pass it to the init method of your superclass which is the exception class so this is how you can create your own custom exception classes and use them to raise the exception in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video you
