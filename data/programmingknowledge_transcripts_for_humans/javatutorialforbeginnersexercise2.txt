00:01 - hello and welcome back to the another
00:02 - video of the Java tutorial Series
00:04 - whereing today we will be covering uh
00:06 - one exercise number two uh so till now I
00:09 - have taught you Loops in Java and some
00:12 - basic concepts of java So based on that
00:16 - uh I have created five questions here
00:19 - here you can see and I expect you that
00:22 - you should give it a try to this
00:25 - question and try solving this question
00:27 - and post your comments answers in
00:30 - comment section
00:31 - okay so let's discuss one by one uh
00:34 - questions okay so first question is
00:36 - write a program to calculate the sum of
00:39 - first 10 natural numbers so you have to
00:41 - create one Loop wherein you will be
00:43 - calculating the sum of first 10 natural
00:46 - numbers okay uh so for the second one
00:48 - write a program that prompts the user to
00:51 - the to input a positive integers okay so
00:53 - first of all you have to take uh use a
00:56 - input user input from the user where a
00:58 - positive number and it it should then
01:01 - print the multiplication table of that
01:02 - number and let's suppose I have a given
01:05 - input as a 2 then it will show me a it
01:09 - the program should show me the whole
01:11 - table of the two okay and then third one
01:15 - is the writer program to find a
01:17 - factorial value of any number enter
01:19 - through the keyboard means you have to
01:21 - take input from the user and whatever
01:23 - the input in the user has given based on
01:26 - that you have to out give the output to
01:29 - the user as a factorial factorial value
01:31 - of that number okay
01:34 - so fourth number is write a program that
01:36 - prompts a user to an input an integer
01:39 - and then output the number with the
01:41 - digits reversed okay so what does it
01:44 - mean actually here you can see example
01:46 - one two three four five is there and the
01:50 - output which you you should given give
01:53 - to the user is five four three two one
01:54 - means just a reverse of that number
01:56 - which is given by the user okay so fifth
01:59 - one is write a program to print the
02:01 - Fibonacci series of n terms where n is
02:04 - the input by the user okay so N means
02:07 - any number let's suppose I have given 5
02:09 - as a input so so your program should
02:12 - return me the first five elements of the
02:15 - Fibonacci series Fibonacci series is
02:17 - nothing but the addition of the two
02:21 - numbers okay so CD start from 0 and 1
02:24 - and the the next next third term should
02:28 - be addition of the past two terms okay
02:30 - so past two terms are 0 and 1 0 plus 1
02:32 - is 1 so now now for the fourth term we
02:35 - can add the past two terms 1 plus 1 is 2
02:38 - and then again for the fifth term
02:40 - addition of the third and fourth term
02:42 - two plus one is three like that the
02:44 - series go on okay so I hope you try this
02:48 - questions and in upcoming videos we will
02:51 - see the solution to the questions before
02:54 - that you should try this question so
02:56 - thank you for watching this video

hello and welcome back to the another video of the Java tutorial Series whereing today we will be covering uh one exercise number two uh so till now I have taught you Loops in Java and some basic concepts of java So based on that uh I have created five questions here here you can see and I expect you that you should give it a try to this question and try solving this question and post your comments answers in comment section okay so let's discuss one by one uh questions okay so first question is write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural numbers so you have to create one Loop wherein you will be calculating the sum of first 10 natural numbers okay uh so for the second one write a program that prompts the user to the to input a positive integers okay so first of all you have to take uh use a input user input from the user where a positive number and it it should then print the multiplication table of that number and let's suppose I have a given input as a 2 then it will show me a it the program should show me the whole table of the two okay and then third one is the writer program to find a factorial value of any number enter through the keyboard means you have to take input from the user and whatever the input in the user has given based on that you have to out give the output to the user as a factorial factorial value of that number okay so fourth number is write a program that prompts a user to an input an integer and then output the number with the digits reversed okay so what does it mean actually here you can see example one two three four five is there and the output which you you should given give to the user is five four three two one means just a reverse of that number which is given by the user okay so fifth one is write a program to print the Fibonacci series of n terms where n is the input by the user okay so N means any number let's suppose I have given 5 as a input so so your program should return me the first five elements of the Fibonacci series Fibonacci series is nothing but the addition of the two numbers okay so CD start from 0 and 1 and the the next next third term should be addition of the past two terms okay so past two terms are 0 and 1 0 plus 1 is 1 so now now for the fourth term we can add the past two terms 1 plus 1 is 2 and then again for the fifth term addition of the third and fourth term two plus one is three like that the series go on okay so I hope you try this questions and in upcoming videos we will see the solution to the questions before that you should try this question so thank you for watching this video
