00:00 - hello guys now in this video we'll be
00:02 - learning about the case statement okay
00:04 - so if you are aware of the switch switch
00:07 - statements in different languages and
00:09 - you you it will be very easy for you
00:10 - guys but not let me tell you about how
00:12 - it will work so why this basically came
00:15 - in role first of all we will discuss
00:16 - about this so in many programs you get
00:19 - to know about that there are multiple
00:21 - effect conditions and that will be very
00:23 - confusing but in case of uh switch case
00:27 - or you can use you can tell the K system
00:29 - it is very easy to understand those
00:31 - things and
00:33 - use it so what I will do I will just
00:36 - create a new file that is a case dot sh
00:39 - okay so I will take the example of the
00:42 - grading system okay so if the grid is a
00:45 - then
00:47 - that will be very good like we will
00:50 - print something out integrate I will
00:52 - write like this
00:54 - and I will create a variable grade and
00:56 - how will we use it we'll use it case
00:59 - dollar grade okay
01:02 - and then what we'll do we will use the
01:05 - in keyword and here we will add the
01:08 - certain conditions like if the grid is a
01:11 - then what to do so here I will do like a
01:14 - then what we have to do not this one uh
01:18 - wait a minute yeah I've used only this
01:20 - bracket closing bracket so in this case
01:23 - I will Echo
01:26 - it's uh your
01:29 - uh your
01:32 - marks
01:34 - is
01:35 - between
01:37 - 9200 okay I can use like this then if
01:41 - the grade is B no and but before that
01:44 - what we have to do you have to just add
01:47 - this semicolon like this is the syntax
01:49 - of using the switch case in this so for
01:52 - B
01:53 - you will write like eco
01:59 - uh your marks yes and between
02:05 - 81 to 90.
02:08 - like this
02:10 - okay and so on like let me call uh use
02:15 - the semicolon
02:18 - and then we will use a c grade
02:22 - and then I will Echo
02:25 - your marks is in between
02:30 - 71 to 80 okay and then we have to just
02:39 - use the asterisk we can use for default
02:45 - and here we will use the semicolon first
02:49 - and here I will eco
02:53 - your marks
02:56 - as your marks below
03:00 - 70 like this and then we have to use the
03:04 - e-stack keyword and we are good to go
03:07 - now we will just give the permission to
03:10 - this script
03:11 - uh 10 okay done now I will run the
03:15 - subscription the enter my grid I will
03:17 - enter c
03:18 - your mass is between this okay I will
03:20 - enter
03:21 - B imagine between this I will enter e so
03:25 - your marks will be below 70. okay so in
03:28 - this way this thing works okay so I hope
03:30 - you like this videos guys and if you
03:32 - have any confusion about this you can
03:34 - ask us in the comment section okay and I
03:37 - will surely add this course in our
03:38 - GitHub repository you can access this
03:40 - course from there okay so that's all for
03:42 - today's guys I will meet you in the next
03:43 - video so thank you for watching
