00:02 - hello and welcome back to another video
00:03 - of the Java tutorial Series so till now
00:06 - we have covered class objects and I
00:09 - guess static keyword in Java and today
00:12 - onwards we will be learning inheritance
00:14 - in Java so I will be dividing
00:17 - inheritance in two videos in this video
00:19 - we will be talking about the theoretical
00:21 - theoretical part of the inheritance what
00:24 - is inheritance why it is required and
00:26 - what are the different terms which is
00:27 - which are used in The Inheritance and in
00:31 - the second video we will be discussing
00:32 - about the types of inheritance because
00:34 - there are basically five types in are
00:37 - there in inheritance and we will be
00:39 - discussing each type using the example
00:42 - code example okay so let's just get
00:45 - started uh so what is inheritance
00:47 - inheritance in Java is a mechanism in
00:49 - which one object acquires all the
00:51 - property and the behavior of the parent
00:53 - object so basically there are two terms
00:56 - are here
00:57 - sub class or the child class or the
01:00 - parent class okay parent class is the
01:02 - class whose properties are inherited by
01:05 - the child class child class uses the
01:07 - property which are declared inside the
01:08 - parent class and it is important it is
01:12 - important part of the object oriented
01:13 - programming system and inheritance
01:15 - represents the is a relationship which
01:18 - is also known as parent child
01:19 - relationship okay and you may ask why to
01:23 - use inheritance in Java okay so there
01:25 - are basically two reasons for method
01:27 - overriding so that we will discuss what
01:30 - is method overriding in our upcoming
01:31 - videos uh basically it it is used to
01:34 - achieve the runtime polymorphism in Java
01:37 - and photo code reusability code
01:40 - reusability means uh suppose we you have
01:44 - declared some variables and the methods
01:45 - inside the parent class and those
01:47 - methods and variables are required for
01:49 - you to write in in the another class
01:52 - and then instead of writing those
01:54 - variables and methods again and again
01:55 - you can just inherit the properties of
01:57 - that method and variable from the parent
02:00 - class to the child class in that case
02:03 - one is one become the parent class whose
02:06 - properties can get getting inherited and
02:08 - child class becomes the class whose
02:11 - property who's inheriting the property
02:13 - okay
02:14 - so there are different terms which are
02:16 - used in inheritance one is class a class
02:18 - is a group of objects which have common
02:20 - properties it is a template of blueprint
02:23 - from which objects are created uh as we
02:26 - have discussed in our previous videos
02:27 - and subclass and the child class
02:30 - subclass is the class which inherits the
02:32 - other class as I have told you the child
02:35 - class will inherit the properties from
02:37 - the parent class and superclass slash
02:40 - parent class is the class whose
02:42 - properties are getting inherited by the
02:44 - child classes and reusability as the
02:47 - names specifies reliability is a
02:49 - mechanism which gives you to reuse the
02:53 - fields and the methods of the existing
02:54 - class when you create a new class and
02:57 - you can use the same fields and methods
02:59 - already defined in the previous class so
03:02 - for achieving The Inheritance in Java we
03:04 - have the syntax uh we have to write this
03:06 - in this syntax class sub class name you
03:10 - can write here the subclass name and
03:12 - extend is the keyword which is used to
03:15 - Java and the superclass name and inside
03:18 - the curly basis you can write a write
03:21 - ordinary to the properties which you
03:22 - want to inherit from the building parent
03:24 - class
03:24 - okay so this is pretty much about the
03:27 - inheritance in Java theoretical part uh
03:29 - from the next video onwards we will be
03:31 - looking into the types of the United
03:33 - States that there are single multi-level
03:35 - hierarchical multiple and hybrid there
03:38 - are five types of initials in Java and
03:40 - one more thing multiple inheritances in
03:43 - Java is not supported and we can still
03:46 - achieve it but there is one thing uh
03:48 - concept that you to know how to achieve
03:51 - the multiple inheritance in Java that
03:53 - way that also we will be looking into
03:54 - the when we are going into the abstracts
03:56 - and encapsulation part
03:58 - okay so for now uh this is pretty much
04:02 - about the United NC Java and from next
04:04 - video onwards we will be saving seeing
04:06 - uh each type in detail with code example
04:09 - thank you

hello and welcome back to another video of the Java tutorial Series so till now we have covered class objects and I guess static keyword in Java and today onwards we will be learning inheritance in Java so I will be dividing inheritance in two videos in this video we will be talking about the theoretical theoretical part of the inheritance what is inheritance why it is required and what are the different terms which is which are used in The Inheritance and in the second video we will be discussing about the types of inheritance because there are basically five types in are there in inheritance and we will be discussing each type using the example code example okay so let's just get started uh so what is inheritance inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the property and the behavior of the parent object so basically there are two terms are here sub class or the child class or the parent class okay parent class is the class whose properties are inherited by the child class child class uses the property which are declared inside the parent class and it is important it is important part of the object oriented programming system and inheritance represents the is a relationship which is also known as parent child relationship okay and you may ask why to use inheritance in Java okay so there are basically two reasons for method overriding so that we will discuss what is method overriding in our upcoming videos uh basically it it is used to achieve the runtime polymorphism in Java and photo code reusability code reusability means uh suppose we you have declared some variables and the methods inside the parent class and those methods and variables are required for you to write in in the another class and then instead of writing those variables and methods again and again you can just inherit the properties of that method and variable from the parent class to the child class in that case one is one become the parent class whose properties can get getting inherited and child class becomes the class whose property who's inheriting the property okay so there are different terms which are used in inheritance one is class a class is a group of objects which have common properties it is a template of blueprint from which objects are created uh as we have discussed in our previous videos and subclass and the child class subclass is the class which inherits the other class as I have told you the child class will inherit the properties from the parent class and superclass slash parent class is the class whose properties are getting inherited by the child classes and reusability as the names specifies reliability is a mechanism which gives you to reuse the fields and the methods of the existing class when you create a new class and you can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class so for achieving The Inheritance in Java we have the syntax uh we have to write this in this syntax class sub class name you can write here the subclass name and extend is the keyword which is used to Java and the superclass name and inside the curly basis you can write a write ordinary to the properties which you want to inherit from the building parent class okay so this is pretty much about the inheritance in Java theoretical part uh from the next video onwards we will be looking into the types of the United States that there are single multilevel hierarchical multiple and hybrid there are five types of initials in Java and one more thing multiple inheritances in Java is not supported and we can still achieve it but there is one thing uh concept that you to know how to achieve the multiple inheritance in Java that way that also we will be looking into the when we are going into the abstracts and encapsulation part okay so for now uh this is pretty much about the United NC Java and from next video onwards we will be saving seeing uh each type in detail with code example thank you
