00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:01 - show you how you can install Kali Linux
00:04 - on your BM where virtual machine it can
00:08 - be a player or VMware Workstation the
00:11 - procedure will be the same
00:13 - now hopefully you have already
00:14 - downloaded VMware Player of VMware
00:17 - Workstation so just open your VMware
00:20 - virtual machine and to download the ISO
00:25 - file for Kali Linux just go to your
00:27 - favorite browser and search for Kali
00:30 - Linux here and the first link which will
00:33 - appear here will be from Kali dot o-r-g
00:36 - so we are going to just click this link
00:38 - or you can directly click this download
00:41 - you know link from here so let's click
00:44 - this link which is going to open Kali
00:47 - dot o-r-g
00:49 - and in here you have few options at the
00:53 - top and one of the option is downloads
00:56 - just click this downloads option and now
01:00 - you have different you know ISO files
01:03 - here so the one I have downloaded is
01:08 - this one which is the ISO file for
01:11 - 64-bit colleague Kali ok
01:14 - and it's about 2.6 GB you know file so
01:19 - you need to wait for the download to
01:22 - complete so I have already downloaded
01:24 - this ISO file from this link
01:27 - but if you haven't just clicked this ISO
01:29 - option from here and wait for the
01:32 - download to complete and once this ISO
01:35 - file is downloaded it's going to look
01:37 - like this which says Kali - Linux - 2016
01:43 - and then it's going to give the version
01:47 - which is AMD 64 not ISO okay so just
01:51 - download it and once it's downloaded we
01:53 - are ready to you know install Kali Linux
01:56 - on our VMware virtual machine so in here
02:01 - in your VMware Player just click this
02:04 - option which says create a new virtual
02:06 - machine and in here you have three
02:10 - options one is installer disc which we
02:12 - don't
02:13 - want we want this installer disc image
02:16 - using ISO so just click the second
02:18 - option and then browse for your ISO file
02:22 - okay
02:23 - so I'm just going to copy this link and
02:26 - paste it here and open this location in
02:29 - which my Kiley ISO file is there
02:33 - just just choose your ISO file which you
02:36 - have downloaded and just click open and
02:38 - then click Next now in here you just
02:42 - need to choose Linux and Kali is not
02:46 - listed in this list of Linux operating
02:51 - system which is listed in VMware Player
02:54 - so what we can choose from here is this
02:58 - option which says Debian 7 dot X 64 bit
03:03 - or you can choose Debian 8 point X 64
03:06 - bit whatever is the latest version of
03:09 - Debian so we are going to choose Debian
03:11 - 8 point X 64 bit ok so just choose this
03:16 - option and then click Next and in here
03:19 - you can give the name to your virtual
03:22 - machine so for example I'm going to give
03:25 - the name Kali 64-bit ok and then this is
03:31 - the location where your virtual machine
03:35 - will be installed so if you want to
03:37 - change it just browse the location
03:38 - wherever you want and once you selected
03:42 - it just click Next from here now in here
03:45 - it's going to ask you to specify the
03:47 - disk capacity by default it requires 20
03:51 - GB but you can increase it from here for
03:55 - example I want around 13 GB and this
03:58 - second option is fine for us which says
04:01 - list virtual disk into multiple files so
04:04 - just choose the second option here ok
04:06 - and then click Next and in here you can
04:11 - just you know see the selections you
04:15 - have made for example the name we have
04:17 - selected as 64-bit and the hard disk is
04:21 - you know 30gb and in here memory is 512
04:26 - so if you want to change it you can just
04:29 - click this customize hardware button and
04:32 - it's going to open this kind of hardware
04:35 - interface and in here we can increase
04:38 - the memory by default it's 512 megabyte
04:42 - 4 but I want for example 2 GB of memory
04:45 - so I can just scroll this scroll bar to
04:49 - 2 GB and in here by default it uses 1
04:53 - processor so we can choose multiple
04:55 - processors also for example I want to
04:57 - choose 4 processor 4 core processors so
05:01 - just choose 4 from here and once
05:04 - everything is done just close it ok so
05:08 - once your you know customization is done
05:12 - you can just click finish from here so
05:15 - once you click finish it's going to
05:17 - create a new virtual machine for you you
05:20 - can see Kali 64 so just select this Kali
05:23 - 64 from here and then click lay virtual
05:27 - machine and it's going to start the
05:29 - installation of Kali Linux so you just
05:33 - need to wait for a few seconds until
05:35 - this installation starts now in here
05:39 - what we need to choose here is the
05:42 - graphical install so just press your
05:45 - down key and just choose this option
05:48 - which says graphical install ok and
05:52 - click enter or press ENTER button and
05:55 - then it's going to you know start the
05:58 - procedure for your Kali Linux operating
06:02 - system is now in the next step what we
06:04 - need to do is we need to choose the
06:06 - language which we want to use for Kali
06:09 - Linux so for example we want to choose
06:11 - English as our language so just leave it
06:14 - as default otherwise choose your
06:16 - language and then click continue now in
06:19 - here you can choose your location right
06:22 - so you can choose from this list the
06:25 - country and area in which you are you
06:28 - know living in for example I want to
06:31 - choose UK and then I will clay
06:34 - continue okay now the next step is to
06:38 - choose your keyboard layout for your
06:41 - computer so for example if you are using
06:44 - British English keyboard then you can
06:47 - leave it as default otherwise choose the
06:50 - keyboard type which you are using for
06:52 - example I am using German keyboards so I
06:56 - can choose this option German and then I
06:59 - will click continue okay so now it's
07:02 - going to load the Staller component from
07:05 - CD and it's going to just you know
07:09 - finish this progress bar loading
07:11 - additional components so we just need to
07:14 - wait for some times to complete this
07:17 - process and then we can go forward okay
07:21 - now in the next step we are asked for
07:24 - the configuration of the network and the

10:23 - some time our installation is going to
10:25 - be finished so in here it says finish
10:29 - the installation and it says
10:32 - installation is complete so it is time
10:35 - to boot into your new system make sure
10:38 - to remove the installation media so that
10:41 - you can boot into the new system rather
10:44 - than restarting the installation right
10:46 - so we will just click continue and now
10:50 - it's going to boot into our new Kali
10:53 - Linux operating system so in here if you
10:57 - see this kind of interface you just need
10:59 - to wait for a while
11:01 - and then you will be able to see your
11:03 - login window for Kali Linux so just wait
11:07 - for this process to complete and now we
11:10 - can see this kind of interface which is

11:33 - going to sign in to our Kali Linux
11:36 - operating system and hopefully we will
11:39 - be able to see our Kali Linux desktop
11:42 - environment so now you can see this kind
11:47 - of Kali Linux desktop environment so you
11:50 - know that Kali Linux is already
11:53 - installed in our virtual machine which
11:58 - is VMware so in this way you can install
12:01 - Kali Linux on your VMware virtual

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install Kali Linux on your BM where virtual machine it can be a player or VMware Workstation the procedure will be the same now hopefully you have already downloaded VMware Player of VMware Workstation so just open your VMware virtual machine and to download the ISO file for Kali Linux just go to your favorite browser and search for Kali Linux here and the first link which will appear here will be from Kali dot org so we are going to just click this link or you can directly click this download you know link from here so let's click

the latest version of Debian so we are going to choose Debian 8 point X 64 bit ok so just choose this option and then click Next and in here you can give the name to your virtual machine so for example I'm going to give the name Kali 64bit ok and then this is the location where your virtual machine will be installed so if you want to change it just browse the location wherever you want and once you selected it just click Next from here now in here it's going to ask you to specify the disk capacity by default it requires 20 GB but you can increase it from here for example I want around
