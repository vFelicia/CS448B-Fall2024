00:14 - going to use a tool called UTM which is
00:17 - similar to Virtual box and we will
00:19 - install open2 on our Mac operating
00:23 - system using UTM first of all we are
00:26 - going to install UTM let's see how we
00:29 - can install UTM on our Mac operating
00:32 - system so just search for UTM and the
00:36 - first link which will appear here will
00:37 - be from
00:38 - mac. getet UTM doapp so we are going to

01:00 - more about this UTM tool so here I'm
01:04 - going to click on this download
01:07 - button which is going to start the
01:09 - download of this UTM do DMG file so once
01:14 - this UTM DMG file is downloaded I'm
01:16 - going to click on this UTM DMG file and
01:20 - we are ready to install the UTM tool
01:22 - here you just need to select the UTM
01:25 - icon and then press command key and drag
01:27 - and drop this UTM icon on your
01:31 - applications folder which is going to
01:33 - install UTM on your Mac operating system
01:39 - now once UTM is installed we can
01:42 - minimize this and then we can go to the
01:44 - Launchpad area and we can see this UTM
01:48 - icon here so I'm going to open the UTM
01:51 - tool from here and you can see UTM is
01:55 - successfully installed and it's running
01:57 - on our Mac operating system so here you
02:00 - can see what's new I'm going to just
02:02 - click on continue here and this UTM tool
02:07 - looks something like this now once you
02:09 - have UTM installed we are going to move
02:12 - forward with the download of the obuntu
02:16 - ISO file so because we want to install
02:19 - Ubuntu on our Mac operating system with
02:23 - supports M1 or M2 which is the arm
02:26 - architecture we are going to download
02:28 - the arm image
02:30 - of Ubuntu so when I go to my favorite
02:34 - browser and search for Ubuntu I can see
02:36 - this first link which is ubuntu.com I'm
02:38 - going to click on this link here I'm
02:41 - going to select uh Ubuntu Server I can
02:45 - also select Ubuntu desktop but when I
02:49 - download the Ubuntu desktop ISO image
02:52 - it's an AMD image and at this point we
02:55 - want the arm image and that is only
02:59 - available for open to server so I'm
03:01 - going to select open to server here and
03:04 - then you can click on download open to
03:06 - server and then you need to go to
03:11 - Alternative
03:12 - architectures so here you can see the
03:16 - arm architecture and this is what we
03:18 - want right so you don't need to download
03:22 - this uh AMD uh ISO image you need to
03:26 - click on the alternative architecture
03:28 - and download the arm uh architecture ISO
03:32 - file so I'm going to click on arm here
03:35 - and then it says open to server for arm
03:38 - and then we are going to click on this
03:39 - download button which is going to start
03:42 - the download of this obuntu
03:44 - 24.4 live server which is the arm server
03:48 - right so I have already downloaded this
03:50 - ISO file so I'm going to cancel this
03:53 - download and let me show you the
03:57 - download section here so we are going to
03:59 - install Ubuntu using this Ubuntu Server
04:02 - arm image now I'm going to open my
04:07 - UTM manager which looks like this and
04:11 - here we are going to create a new
04:13 - virtual machine so I'm going to click on
04:16 - this create a new virtual machine button
04:19 - and then I'm going to select the first
04:20 - option and it says faster but can only
04:24 - run the native CPU architecture and
04:26 - that's why we have downloaded the arm
04:30 - based image and not AMD based image so
04:33 - I'm going to select virtualize here and
04:36 - then I'm going to select Lin here and
04:39 - here I'm going to select the path of the
04:43 - ISO file so you need to just leave these
04:46 - checkboxes as unchecked and in the third
04:50 - section you need to click on
04:52 - browse and select the obuntu live server
04:55 - image right you can see I have also
04:58 - downloaded the am MD uh image which is
05:02 - the AMD 64-bit image but this image we
05:05 - don't want we have downloaded the Arm
05:08 - based live server image and this is the
05:11 - image we want and then you can click on
05:14 - open and you can see it's selected here
05:17 - and then click on continue
05:18 - here now in the hardware section you can
05:21 - select the memory by default it's 4,000
05:23 - MB you can increase this or decrease
05:26 - this depending on the capacity of your
05:29 - Mac operating system you can also select
05:33 - the number of processors so for example
05:35 - I'm going to select eight processors but
05:37 - it totally depends uh on your Mac
05:41 - operating system how much cores you have
05:44 - available you can also check this
05:46 - checkbox and then click on continue here
05:48 - now the storage by default which is
05:51 - assigned by UTM is 64 GB you can
05:54 - increase or decrease this uh storage
05:57 - depending on the capacity which is
06:00 - remaining on your Mac operating system
06:03 - I'm going to click on continue here and
06:06 - then you can also select the shared
06:09 - directory so I'm going to click on
06:10 - browse here and then I'm going to select
06:13 - downloads uh directory as the shared
06:16 - directory and then click on open and
06:18 - then click on continue here I can see
06:21 - the summary and I can also give the name
06:24 - to my open 2 uh machine so instead of
06:26 - Linux I'm going to write open 2
06:31 - 24.4
06:33 - LTS okay and then you can also select
06:37 - this uh checkbox so just check this
06:39 - checkbox it's going to open the settings
06:42 - for your virtual machine which you are
06:45 - creating so I'm going to click on Save
06:47 - here which is going to just open the
06:50 - settings section so you can later also
06:54 - change these settings for example if you
06:56 - want to reduce the uh CPU count or the
07:00 - memory you can decrease it from here for
07:03 - now everything looks okay for me so I'm
07:05 - going to click on Save here and once my
07:09 - virtual machine is created I can click
07:11 - on this run button to start the
07:14 - installation of my Ubuntu server for now

08:09 - select this and then I'm going to move
08:13 - my cursor to the German keyboard layout
08:17 - you can also change this from here so if
08:21 - you are using any other keyboard layout

08:28 - then once it's selected just select done
08:32 - here and then press
08:33 - enter now in the next section it says

10:22 - username which is code bind
10:26 - again and then the password I'm going to
10:28 - choose a varable very simple password
10:30 - here and then I'm going to choose done
10:32 - and then press
10:34 - enter and then uh here it says upgrade
10:38 - to open 2 Pro I don't want to do that so
10:40 - I'm going to just skip this for now and
10:43 - then it says you can choose to install
10:47 - open SSH package to enable secure remote
10:50 - access I want to do this so I'm going to
10:52 - select uh this option by pressing space
10:55 - key which is going to add the X in front

11:08 - driver so I'm going to click on continue
11:10 - here and then here for now I don't want
11:13 - to install any third party drivers so
11:16 - I'm going to just move my cursor to done
11:19 - and then press enter and then it's going
11:22 - to start the installation of the system
11:24 - so at this point you just need to wait
11:26 - for a few seconds so once the
11:28 - installation is finished it's going to
11:31 - uh look like this at the end it says
11:33 - late for slash run colon that means the
11:37 - installation is finished now you can
11:39 - just use your arrow keys to move down
11:43 - here and just select the option which
11:45 - says reboot now and then press enter
11:49 - which is going to start the reboot now
11:52 - at this point if the reboot doesn't
11:54 - start then you can manually close this
11:58 - window and and start the open to
12:01 - operating system so as I can see this
12:04 - reboot is not starting at this point
12:07 - what I can do is I can select this
12:09 - option which says shut down or stop the
12:11 - virtual machine and then click on okay
12:13 - here which is going to stop the virtual
12:17 - machine and you can close this window
12:20 - now once your virtual machine is closed
12:22 - what you need to do here is you just
12:24 - need to uh make this little bit bigger
12:27 - here then when you uh start your virtual
12:30 - machine it's going to again try to
12:33 - install your Ubuntu if you don't clear
12:36 - this uh section for your ISO file okay
12:40 - so here in this last section you just
12:43 - need to select clear here if you don't
12:47 - choose this then the installation
12:49 - process is going to start again which we
12:51 - don't want right so choose uh the clear
12:55 - option once it's cleared just start your
12:58 - virtual machine again and now our Ubuntu
13:01 - server has been started so now because
13:04 - we have installed the Ubuntu Server
13:06 - which doesn't come with GUI that's why
13:09 - the login comes with the command line so
13:12 - here you can provide your username I'm
13:15 - going to provide my username as code
13:17 - bind here and then it's going to ask me
13:19 - for my password I'm going to just
13:21 - provide my uh password here and then
13:24 - press enter which will log me into my
13:26 - Ubuntu Server so now our untu server is
13:30 - installed but we want to use the Ubuntu
13:33 - using the graphical user interface which
13:36 - we are used to and we don't want to use
13:38 - this command line tool to uh work with
13:42 - our Ubuntu operating system on the Mac
13:45 - so for that I have some command which
13:48 - I'm going to give you in the description
13:49 - of this video also and these commands
13:52 - look like this so to install the obuntu
13:56 - desktop we want to use this command
13:59 - which says Pudo appt install open to
14:02 - desktop but before that we need to give
14:04 - this command which is Pudo appt update
14:06 - and we need to also give the Pudo appt
14:10 - install tasks cell so let's give these
14:12 - commands one by one first one is Pudo
14:15 - appt update so let's open our open to
14:19 - server here here I'm going to just write
14:21 - Pudo apt update and then press enter and
14:26 - here you need to provide your ubun to's
14:28 - password which you have given at the
14:29 - time of installation of UB 2 and then
14:31 - press
14:33 - enter once that's done let me clear the
14:37 - terminal and then we are going to give
14:39 - the next command and that command is
14:41 - sudo apt install task seel and then
14:44 - press enter here and then press Y and
14:48 - then press enter again which is going to
14:51 - install this
14:53 - tool and once that's done we going to
14:56 - give the next command and this will be
14:59 - the installation of our open to desktop
15:02 - so the third command here is Pudo app
15:06 - install open to hyphen desktop so let's
15:09 - give that command I'm going to just
15:12 - write PSE sudo app install open to
15:18 - hyphen desktop and then press enter and
15:22 - it's going to start the graphical user
15:25 - interface for Ubuntu press y here and
15:28 - then press enter
15:29 - now this process of installation of gome
15:33 - desktop is going to take around 20 to 30
15:37 - minutes so you don't need to touch
15:39 - anything just make sure that your Mac
15:42 - operating system is connected to the
15:44 - power source and then just leave this uh
15:49 - window open and wait until this process
15:52 - is finished as I said it can take 20
15:55 - minutes to half an hour so now the
15:59 - installation of Ubuntu desktop has been
16:01 - finished so we can restart our uh
16:05 - virtual machine which is the open to
16:07 - server machine so for that you can clear
16:11 - the terminal I am going to uh give the
16:13 - clear command to clear the terminal and
16:17 - then you can just write sud sudo
16:21 - reboot now and then press enter and give
16:24 - your open to password again and then
16:27 - press enter which is going to reboot
16:30 - your open to operating
16:34 - system now every time you reboot your
16:38 - buntu operating system it might take few
16:41 - uh seconds to reboot so you just need to
16:44 - wait for few seconds to a minute
16:47 - depending on the speed of uh your Mac
16:51 - operating system and now I can see the
16:54 - graphical user interface so now I can
16:59 - log in with my username this is the
17:01 - username which I have given at the time
17:03 - of installation of open to server and
17:05 - then I'm going to just give my password
17:07 - here and I'm logged into my open 2
17:11 - operating
17:12 - system and now I can see the graphical
17:15 - user interface here now here this is the
17:18 - welcome window for Ubuntu I can click on
17:21 - next here and for Ubuntu Pro I'm going
17:25 - to skip for now so click on next and
17:28 - then I'm going to click on no I don't
17:30 - want to share any data and click on next
17:33 - and then I'm going to finish this so now
17:35 - you can start using Ubuntu on your Mac
17:38 - operating
17:39 - system now uh I'm going to give you two
17:43 - more commands so that uh you can use the
17:47 - shared folder with your Mac operating
17:51 - system and also we can increase the
17:55 - resolution of our Mac operating system
17:58 - uh by just tweaking a small setting in
18:02 - our virtual machine so for that first of
18:05 - all we are going to open the terminal
18:07 - just click on this show apps icon and
18:10 - then click on the terminal option and
18:13 - this time we are going to give this
18:17 - command which is pseudo app install
18:19 - spice VD agent and pseudo app install
18:24 - spice web
18:26 - davd you can you can also combine these
18:29 - two commands in one command by just uh
18:32 - giving this command which is pseudo appt
18:35 - install spice hyphen VD agent space the
18:40 - spice hyphen web da VD okay these
18:45 - commands also I'm going to give you in
18:47 - the description of this video so let's
18:49 - give this command and I'm going to press
18:51 - enter here and then give my open to
18:53 - password and then press enter which is
18:56 - going to install these two uh tools and
18:59 - once that's done we are going to reboot
19:02 - our system once again so I'm going to
19:04 - close this terminal and then click on
19:06 - this power button and then click on this
19:09 - power icon and then click on power off
19:11 - and then click on power off which is
19:13 - going to shut down my open to machine
19:16 - and then I can close this window now
19:18 - once again I'm going to open UTM here
19:21 - and this time I'm going to select my
19:23 - virtual machine and then I'm going to
19:26 - addit some settings so so here is the
19:28 - set settings icon so click on these
19:30 - three lines icon here and then I can go
19:34 - to the sharing section and this time you
19:37 - will see this option which says sprice
19:41 - webdav so click on this option and then
19:44 - we have already selected the downloads
19:46 - folder for sharing right so I'm going to
19:49 - click on open here and then click on
19:51 - Save
19:53 - here and once that's done one more thing
19:56 - we can do here is just open the settings
19:59 - once again and then click on display
20:02 - here and then click on retia mode which
20:06 - is going to enhance your display
20:09 - resolution of your open to operating
20:12 - system and then click on Save once again
20:15 - once that's done I'm going to click on
20:17 - the Run button again which is going to
20:21 - start my open to Virtual
20:24 - Machine and once I see the login window
20:27 - I'm going to give my my open to's
20:29 - password again and log to my obuntu
20:32 - operating system and this time when I
20:36 - just uh increase the size of this uh
20:39 - Ubuntu desktop you can see the
20:42 - resolution of Ubuntu is increased now
20:45 - right now I can click on this uh File
20:49 - Explorer or folder Explorer and then
20:53 - maximize the size and then when I click
20:55 - on other locations here I can see the
20:58 - spice client folder here I can see all
21:03 - the files which are available in my
21:05 - MacBooks download folder so let me open
21:08 - my MacBooks download folder here and I
21:12 - have three files here and all those
21:14 - three files I can see here also so this
21:18 - download folder has been shared so for
21:20 - example I want to transfer some file
21:22 - from my open to operating system to my
21:25 - Mac operating system or from my Mac
21:28 - operating system to my open to operating
21:30 - system I can do this easily so let me
21:33 - create a folder in my uh open to
21:37 - operating system inside my documents
21:39 - folder and I'm going to name this folder
21:41 - as test here and then what I can do here
21:46 - is I can right click here and then click
21:48 - on copy and then go to the spice client
21:53 - folder here and then right click and
21:56 - paste this folder here and and when I go
21:59 - to the downloads folder of my Mac
22:02 - operating system now I can see this test
22:05 - folder there also so this folder is
22:08 - shared between my open 2 and my Mac
22:12 - operating system so this is how you can
22:15 - install Ubuntu 24.0 4 on your Mac
22:19 - operating system using UTM I hope you
22:23 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
22:25 - the next video

can see UTM is successfully installed and it's running on our Mac operating system so here you can see what's new I'm going to just click on continue here and this UTM tool looks something like this now once you have UTM installed we are going to move forward with the download of the obuntu ISO file so because we want to install Ubuntu on our Mac operating system with supports M1 or M2 which is the arm architecture we are going to download the arm image of Ubuntu so when I go to my favorite browser and search for Ubuntu I can see this first link which is ubuntu.com I'm going to click on this link here I'm going to select uh Ubuntu Server I can also select Ubuntu desktop but when I download the Ubuntu desktop ISO image it's an AMD image and at this point we want the arm image and that is only available for open to server so I'm going to select open to server here and then you can click on download open to server and then you need to go to Alternative architectures so here you can see the arm architecture and this is what we want right so you don't need to download this uh AMD uh ISO image you need to click on the alternative architecture and download the arm uh architecture ISO file so I'm going to click on arm here and then it says open to server for arm and then we are going to click on this download button which is going to start the download of this obuntu 24.4 live server which is the arm server right so I have already downloaded this ISO file so I'm going to cancel this download and let me show you the download section here so we are going to install Ubuntu using this Ubuntu Server arm image now I'm going to open my UTM manager which looks like this and here we are going to create a new virtual machine so I'm going to click on this create a new virtual machine button and then I'm going to select the first option and it says faster but can only run the native CPU architecture and that's why we have downloaded the arm based image and not AMD based image so I'm going to select virtualize here and then I'm going to select Lin here and here I'm going to select the path of the ISO file so you need to just leave these checkboxes as unchecked and in the third section you need to click on browse and select the obuntu live server image right you can see I have also downloaded the am MD uh image which is the AMD 64bit image but this image we don't want we have downloaded the Arm based live server image and this is the image we want and then you can click on open and you can see it's selected here and then click on continue here now in the hardware section you can select the memory by default it's 4,000 MB you can increase this or decrease this depending on the capacity of your Mac operating system you can also select the number of processors so for example I'm going to select eight processors but it totally depends uh on your Mac operating system how much cores you have available you can also check this checkbox and then click on continue here now the storage by default which is assigned by UTM is 64 GB you can increase or decrease this uh storage depending on the capacity which is remaining on your Mac operating system I'm going to click on continue here and then you can also select the shared directory so I'm going to click on browse here and then I'm going to select downloads uh directory as the shared directory and then click on open and then click on continue here I can see the summary and I can also give the name to my open 2 uh machine so instead of Linux I'm going to write open 2 24.4 LTS okay and then you can also select this uh checkbox so just check this checkbox it's going to open the settings for your virtual machine which you are creating so I'm going to click on Save here which is going to just open the settings section so you can later also change these settings for example if you want to reduce the uh CPU count or the memory you can decrease it from here for now everything looks okay for me so I'm going to click on Save here and once my virtual machine is created I can click on this run button to start the installation of my Ubuntu server for now and here you just need to drag your mouse inside this black screen and using arrow keys you can move up or down and you need to select the first uh option which says try or install Ubuntu server and then press enter key on your keyboard and here you can see the Ubuntu Server installation has been started so here you can uh use your up or down arrow keys to select the language I'm going to use the English language for this installation so select English and then press enter key now in the next section I can select the keyboard layout which which I want to use for my open to operating system by default it's English us but I want to change it to German keyboard layout because I have the German keyboard layout so I'm going to select this and then I'm going to move my cursor to the German keyboard layout you can also change this from here so if you are using any other keyboard layout other than the default one you can always change this keyboard layout and then once it's selected just select done here and then press enter now in the next section it says choose the type of uh installation by default it's uh obuntu server so we are going to uh just leave it as default and then use the arrow keys to move your selection upwards and we also want to select this option which says search third party drivers so use space key to select this option and then use Arrow key to move down where it highlights the done option and then press enter and in the next section network configuration will be uh shown so I'm going to leave everything as default and then press enter and now you can also give the proxy configuration for now I don't want to give any proxy configuration so I'm going to press enter here and now it says this mirror location pass the test so I'm going to just press enter here and now in the next section I have guided storage configuration so I'm going to leave everything as default here which is use an entire disk and then use my down arrow key to move to the done section and then press enter and then you have the file system summary here I'm going to just press on enter or return key and here I can move my arrow key to continue and then press enter and now I have the next section which says profile configuration here I'm going to give the name to my machine so I'm going to name my machine as code bind here and then move to the next section also server name will be code bind in my case you can give any name here and then I'm going to give the username which is code bind again and then the password I'm going to choose a varable very simple password here and then I'm going to choose done and then press enter and then uh here it says upgrade to open 2 Pro I don't want to do that so I'm going to just skip this for now and then it says you can choose to install open SSH package to enable secure remote access I want to do this so I'm going to select uh this option by pressing space key which is going to add the X in front of install open SSS server and then move the down arrow key to the done and then press enter and then it says third party driver so I'm going to click on continue here and then here for now I don't want to install any third party drivers so I'm going to just move my cursor to done and then press enter and then it's going to start the installation of the system so at this point you just need to wait for a few seconds so once the installation is finished it's going to uh look like this at the end it says late for slash run colon that means the installation is finished now you can just use your arrow keys to move down here and just select the option which says reboot now and then press enter which is going to start the reboot now at this point if the reboot doesn't start then you can manually close this window and and start the open to operating system so as I can see this reboot is not starting at this point what I can do is I can select this option which says shut down or stop the virtual machine and then click on okay here which is going to stop the virtual machine and you can close this window now once your virtual machine is closed what you need to do here is you just need to uh make this little bit bigger here then when you uh start your virtual machine it's going to again try to install your Ubuntu if you don't clear this uh section for your ISO file okay so here in this last section you just need to select clear here if you don't choose this then the installation process is going to start again which we don't want right so choose uh the clear option once it's cleared just start your virtual machine again and now our Ubuntu server has been started so now because we have installed the Ubuntu Server which doesn't come with GUI that's why the login comes with the command line so here you can provide your username I'm going to provide my username as code bind here and then it's going to ask me for my password I'm going to just provide my uh password here and then press enter which will log me into my Ubuntu Server so now our untu server is installed but we want to use the Ubuntu using the graphical user interface which we are used to and we don't want to use this command line tool to uh work with our Ubuntu operating system on the Mac so for that I have some command which I'm going to give you in the description of this video also and these commands look like this so to install the obuntu desktop we want to use this command which says Pudo appt install open to desktop but before that we need to give this command which is Pudo appt update and we need to also give the Pudo appt install tasks cell so let's give these commands one by one first one is Pudo appt update so let's open our open to server here here I'm going to just write Pudo apt update and then press enter and here you need to provide your ubun to's password which you have given at the time of installation of UB 2 and then press enter once that's done let me clear the terminal and then we are going to give the next command and that command is sudo apt install task seel and then press enter here and then press Y and then press enter again which is going to install this tool and once that's done we going to give the next command and this will be the installation of our open to desktop so the third command here is Pudo app install open to hyphen desktop so let's give that command I'm going to just write PSE sudo app install open to hyphen desktop and then press enter and it's going to start the graphical user interface for Ubuntu press y here and then press enter now this process of installation of gome desktop is going to take around 20 to 30 minutes so you don't need to touch anything just make sure that your Mac operating system is connected to the power source and then just leave this uh window open and wait until this process is finished as I said it can take 20 minutes to half an hour so now the installation of Ubuntu desktop has been finished so we can restart our uh virtual machine which is the open to server machine so for that you can clear the terminal I am going to uh give the clear command to clear the terminal and then you can just write sud sudo reboot now and then press enter and give your open to password again and then press enter which is going to reboot your open to operating system now every time you reboot your buntu operating system it might take few uh seconds to reboot so you just need to wait for few seconds to a minute depending on the speed of uh your Mac operating system and now I can see the graphical user interface so now I can log in with my username this is the username which I have given at the time of installation of open to server and then I'm going to just give my password here and I'm logged into my open 2 operating system and now I can see the graphical user interface here now here this is the welcome window for Ubuntu I can click on next here and for Ubuntu Pro I'm going to skip for now so click on next and then I'm going to click on no I don't want to share any data and click on next and then I'm going to finish this so now you can start using Ubuntu on your Mac operating system now uh I'm going to give you two more commands so that uh you can use the shared folder with your Mac operating system and also we can increase the resolution of our Mac operating system uh by just tweaking a small setting in our virtual machine so for that first of all we are going to open the terminal just click on this show apps icon and then click on the terminal option and this time we are going to give this command which is pseudo app install spice VD agent and pseudo app install spice web davd you can you can also combine these two commands in one command by just uh giving this command which is pseudo appt install spice hyphen VD agent space the spice hyphen web da VD okay these commands also I'm going to give you in the description of this video so let's give this command and I'm going to press enter here and then give my open to password and then press enter which is going to install these two uh tools and once that's done we are going to reboot our system once again so I'm going to close this terminal and then click on this power button and then click on this power icon and then click on power off and then click on power off which is going to shut down my open to machine and then I can close this window now once again I'm going to open UTM here and this time I'm going to select my virtual machine and then I'm going to addit some settings so so here is the set settings icon so click on these three lines icon here and then I can go to the sharing section and this time you will see this option which says sprice webdav so click on this option and then we have already selected the downloads folder for sharing right so I'm going to click on open here and then click on Save here and once that's done one more thing we can do here is just open the settings once again and then click on display here and then click on retia mode which is going to enhance your display resolution of your open to operating system and then click on Save once again once that's done I'm going to click on the Run button again which is going to start my open to Virtual Machine and once I see the login window I'm going to give my my open to's password again and log to my obuntu operating system and this time when I just uh increase the size of this uh Ubuntu desktop you can see the resolution of Ubuntu is increased now right now I can click on this uh File Explorer or folder Explorer and then maximize the size and then when I click on other locations here I can see the spice client folder here I can see all the files which are available in my MacBooks download folder so let me open my MacBooks download folder here and I have three files here and all those three files I can see here also so this download folder has been shared so for example I want to transfer some file from my open to operating system to my Mac operating system or from my Mac operating system to my open to operating system I can do this easily so let me create a folder in my uh open to operating system inside my documents folder and I'm going to name this folder as test here and then what I can do here is I can right click here and then click on copy and then go to the spice client folder here and then right click and paste this folder here and and when I go to the downloads folder of my Mac operating system now I can see this test folder there also so this folder is shared between my open 2 and my Mac operating system so this is how you can install Ubuntu 24.0 4 on your Mac operating system using UTM I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
