00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - and now today in this video we are going
00:01 - to talk about one of the more basic
00:03 - command that is a
00:04 - cp command okay so cps stands for just
00:07 - uh like copy okay
00:09 - what we will do like basically we will
00:11 - copy files and directories from one
00:13 - directory to another
00:15 - or from one file to another just like in
00:17 - windows we do right click and click on
00:19 - copy and all
00:20 - so same thing uh like will happen here
00:23 - but using command line okay
00:25 - or you can see using cp command okay so
00:27 - let's start the tutorial uh first of all
00:30 - open up the terminal
00:34 - and let me increase the font size for
00:37 - you
00:39 - okay now it's okay and open this files
00:44 - like for your reference okay
00:48 - okay
00:50 - so here it is
00:53 - now what i will do ls so here are some
00:55 - files okay
00:58 - let me create uh one directory copy
01:04 - command
01:05 - okay i will move into this particular
01:07 - directory
01:08 - and here also i will move in that
01:10 - directory
01:13 - okay
01:14 - so here you can see uh there is no any
01:16 - files or directories here
01:18 - what i want to create i want to create
01:20 - uh files uh let's create one dot txt
01:29 - i will write this as
01:31 - one dot txt file
01:35 - ctrl d okay
01:37 - here you can see one dot xt file has
01:39 - been created now what if you want to
01:41 - create uh
01:42 - the copy of this particular text file
01:45 - okay so how you can do it
01:48 - so to perform this action we have a
01:50 - basic command that is cp command okay it
01:53 - stands for copy so what we will do in a
01:55 - basic simple way
01:57 - we will just give the file name one.txt
02:01 - and where you want to create that
02:03 - particular copy i want to create in the
02:04 - same directory so i will just give the
02:06 - name of that file in which i want to
02:09 - like
02:10 - copy that file so anyway you will see
02:13 - two dot xt is not there okay
02:16 - so what will happen in this case like if
02:18 - the file exists so it will overwrite
02:20 - simply overwrite the whatever you have
02:22 - written
02:23 - but if file doesn't exist so it will
02:25 - create and then
02:27 - after that it will copy the content of
02:29 - one dot text into two dot text okay
02:32 - so let me do ls and i will try to read
02:35 - 2.2.txt
02:37 - so here you can see the content of this
02:39 - particular
02:40 - like
02:43 - particular one.txt file
02:46 - ok
02:47 - so this is the like one of the simple
02:49 - way in which we can copy the files and
02:52 - files okay
02:54 - so now
02:55 - uh what i want i want to copy this
02:58 - one.txt file into some other locations
03:00 - so how we can do it
03:02 - so
03:03 - like
03:05 - right now where you are let's check you
03:08 - are in the this home i use copy command
03:11 - okay i will try to split the terminal so
03:14 - that will be
03:17 - helpful let me like create one more
03:19 - terminal
03:22 - ctrl shift plus i hope it is visible to
03:24 - you
03:30 - let me just
03:31 - reduce some size
03:35 - okay
03:37 - so now what i will do i will do ls here
03:40 - okay
03:41 - now
03:41 - let's do
03:44 - pwd okay
03:46 - and
03:48 - you are in the home i use right now
03:50 - i will just copy this
03:53 - like
03:55 - path
03:56 - now what i want i want to
03:58 - copy this cp
04:01 - one dot txt file
04:04 - at
04:07 - oh sorry
04:14 - one dot txt file and let me paste
04:18 - oh my use okay
04:21 - and here i will create two dot txt
04:25 - so here you can see there is no any two
04:27 - dot txt kind of file
04:29 - let's hit enter
04:31 - and here you will see
04:33 - uh that's to ls and here we will you
04:35 - will see two.txt has been created
04:38 - let me open the like check the content
04:40 - of that particular file
04:43 - so here it is this is one dot txt
04:46 - file okay
04:47 - uh like uh it was a like a little bit uh
04:50 - like difficult because you will need to
04:52 - give the whole path
04:54 - where you want to copy that particular
04:57 - file
04:58 - okay so in this way you can copy uh this
05:01 - uh like file so in any location you want
05:04 - you will just need to give the like
05:06 - whole path okay where you want to copy
05:09 - that particular file
05:10 - now one more thing i want to tell you
05:12 - guys
05:14 - let me clear the screen here also i will
05:16 - do ls here okay
05:18 - now what i want i uh like want to copy
05:21 - that file okay but what if two dot txt
05:25 - file already exists
05:27 - okay so what will happen
05:29 - so
05:31 - now what i will do
05:34 - i will
05:34 - [Music]
05:37 - add some more
05:39 - text in one dot txt
05:43 - some more
05:46 - text has been added in this
05:50 - file okay ctrl d
05:54 - now uh let's check the content of the
05:56 - one.txt
05:58 - so here you can see this one.txt content
06:01 - and let's check the container2.txt it
06:03 - should be like as a similar one one dot
06:06 - txt
06:07 - okay
06:09 - now what we will need to do i will also
06:11 - need to copy this
06:13 - uh one to text into two dot txt okay so
06:16 - i will just try to
06:19 - uh hit the like previous command but
06:22 - here what i will use i will just hit the
06:24 - hyphen i option
06:26 - okay why hyphen i option
06:29 - it will just prompt you for a
06:32 - file overwritten thing like if file
06:34 - already exists so it will prompt like
06:38 - whether you want to overwrite the
06:40 - content of one.txt or not
06:43 - like because there is something else in
06:45 - the 2.txt if you will like without
06:48 - hyphen i you will run this command so it
06:50 - will simply overwrite the content of one
06:52 - dot text into two dot txt
06:54 - but using hyphen i what it will do it
06:56 - will just
06:58 - prompt you for your decision whether you
07:01 - want to overwrite or not okay so let's
07:04 - hit enter
07:05 - and here you can see it is asking for
07:07 - overwrite and question mark
07:09 - uh whether yes or no i will just hit yes
07:13 - now i will
07:15 - try to check the content of this two dot
07:16 - txt file
07:18 - so here you can see like it has been
07:21 - copied
07:22 - okay
07:23 - i hope you got it how you can do it also
07:27 - now what if i want to copy like
07:32 - file 1 and file 2 into some other
07:34 - directory
07:36 - okay
07:37 - so
07:40 - let me
07:40 - like
07:41 - check ls
07:43 - so here you can see one dot txt and two
07:45 - dot txt file is there
07:47 - now what i want i want one dot txt
07:52 - to dot txt into some another directory
07:55 - uh same here in is the same case if
07:58 - directory exists then it will like uh
08:03 - like copy these files if directly
08:05 - doesn't exist it will create a directory
08:07 - and then after that it will copy that
08:09 - like these files into that particular
08:11 - directory okay
08:13 - so how you can do it
08:17 - uh copy one dot text in now directory
08:19 - name so
08:20 - [Applause]
08:22 - what you can write
08:26 - cop paid
08:27 - files
08:30 - okay
08:31 - uh let me hit enter
08:33 - okay is not a director i think i will
08:35 - need to use hyphen r option
08:38 - maybe
08:47 - okay
08:57 - uh let me create a directory copied
09:00 - files
09:04 - and now let me try to copy these
09:09 - file situate
09:11 - okay okay sorry
09:13 - uh
09:14 - let's check ls i will move into this
09:16 - directory
09:18 - and i will ls ok ok now
09:21 - now these files has been comments so in
09:22 - this case like it is not uh
09:25 - creating directory if that directory
09:28 - doesn't exist
09:30 - okay
09:32 - so uh like in this way you can like copy
09:35 - uh
09:36 - like
09:37 - more than one files or into some another
09:42 - directory okay
09:45 - now one more option is there like if you
09:47 - want to copy
09:49 - uh like one directive to some another
09:52 - directory you want to make a copy of
09:53 - directories
09:55 - okay so how you can do it i will move
09:57 - into the
09:59 - home directory
10:00 - and let me clear the screen and then ls
10:03 - okay
10:06 - so what i want to i want this copy
10:08 - command the copy of this
10:11 - copy comma directory
10:13 - so i will use cp hyphen r for the cursor
10:15 - so it is used for the
10:17 - directory copies
10:20 - okay
10:21 - so
10:22 - how you can do it
10:24 - you will give the
10:27 - first the this directory name and
10:30 - another directory in which you want
10:32 - so
10:35 - i will use copy command
10:38 - v2
10:40 - and hit enter
10:41 - and h2 ls
10:43 - and here you will see copy command v2
10:45 - has been created
10:46 - now let's move into this particular
10:48 - directory
10:50 - and ls so here you can see
10:53 - like directors has been
10:55 - like copied okay
10:56 - so in this way uh you can play with the
10:59 - copy command and all okay
11:01 - so that's all for today's video
