00:00 - hello and welcome back guys to the
00:01 - another video of the Java tutorial
00:03 - series wherein in this video we will be
00:05 - learning about Java if Health statements
00:08 - so today onwards we are starting about
00:10 - the conditional statements in uh Java so
00:13 - conditional statements are nothing but
00:14 - the statements which which get executed
00:17 - if the certain condition match
00:19 - okay so there are basically four types
00:22 - in inside it if statement if a statement
00:25 - if else if ladder and nested if still
00:28 - statements will be seeing one after one
00:30 - each other so okay so first Java if is
00:34 - there so in if we declare if and inside
00:38 - if we write some condition if that
00:40 - condition becomes true the code inside
00:43 - that Curly braces will get executed okay
00:46 - so flow of this if statement is run like
00:49 - this so our code gets started and in the
00:52 - first condition gets checked if the
00:54 - condition is false then
00:57 - it if it it will not execute that part
01:00 - of the code and it will get execution is
01:03 - get towards that below that Curly basis
01:05 - and if that condition gets true if code
01:08 - is will get executed okay
01:10 - so uh we will be saying the code
01:13 - implementation also let us first uh try
01:16 - to understand theoretically what is what
01:18 - are those forced
01:20 - types are actually mean okay so Java if
01:23 - else is there anything if else there is
01:25 - else condition is also there so if the
01:29 - condition of the if statement is not
01:30 - true that is its false then else
01:33 - condition will be get executed like here
01:35 - if you can see condition if the
01:37 - condition is true the code the code will
01:40 - get executed inside the if
01:42 - if if block and if the condition is
01:45 - false then the code inside the else Port
01:47 - is getting executed here also you can
01:49 - see uh the program flow comes here
01:52 - condition is getting checked if the
01:54 - condition is false then else code will
01:55 - be get executed and execution get uh
01:59 - successfully done and if the condition
02:01 - is getting true then if code is getting
02:04 - executed okay
02:05 - so next comes Java if else if ladder so
02:09 - it's like a ladder okay so here you can
02:12 - see if condition is there if this
02:14 - condition is not getting executed then
02:16 - if else else if is there so condition
02:19 - another condition is getting checked
02:22 - here okay so if condition 2 is true then
02:25 - this part of the lcf is getting executed
02:28 - so again else one one more lcf is there
02:32 - that is condition three is there if that
02:34 - condition 3 is getting true then this
02:37 - block will be get executed okay and you
02:39 - can declare as many uh else if condition
02:42 - you want and at the last I have declared
02:44 - one else condition that is you all know
02:47 - that will get executed if all those if
02:51 - and else if are generated as false
02:55 - statements okay so let us try to
02:57 - understand why this tray diagram so
02:59 - condition one is there if it is false
03:02 - condition two uh two will be get checked
03:04 - if again it is false condition uh like
03:07 - that and number of condition that you
03:08 - declare inside the code will get checked
03:10 - and any of these any one of this if it
03:13 - is get true then that corresponding
03:16 - statements or the block of the code will
03:18 - be get executed and the program flow
03:20 - will be get uh continued okay if all
03:23 - those else if and else if get false then
03:27 - the else part will be con executed okay
03:31 - so now nested if uh is another concept
03:34 - inside Java so if condition is there
03:37 - inside if condition another if condition
03:39 - is there so we are checking if inside if
03:42 - okay so let us understand by this
03:45 - small exam or tree diagram is here uh so
03:49 - first condition is check if that
03:50 - condition is true if good if code is
03:52 - executed okay and inside that another
03:55 - condition is there that is another if if
03:57 - block is there if that condition true if
03:59 - code is there if that condition is gets
04:02 - getting false then a program code is
04:05 - altered to an outs outside if okay
04:08 - so this is the four types of the Java if
04:12 - else so let's move on move on to the IDE
04:15 - and try to implement each one of these
04:17 - okay so here I have created if else name
04:20 - if else class Java class Java file is
04:24 - there okay uh inside which I have
04:26 - implemented all those four types and I
04:28 - will try to explain you each one of it
04:31 - okay so I will comment it out okay let's
04:36 - try to understand a normal if statement
04:38 - is there okay I have declared an integer
04:40 - name age uh and if I need to Value as 20
04:43 - okay and and we are checking the age
04:46 - okay if
04:47 - age is greater than 18 so this is the
04:51 - part which here you can see the
04:53 - condition part is there so this is the
04:55 - condition that is being checked and if
04:57 - this condition returns true then this
04:59 - block of code will be executed otherwise
05:02 - the book of code which is written
05:04 - outside this that is line number 12
05:05 - which is getting which will be get
05:07 - executed if that condition getting false
05:10 - okay if that in condition gets true this
05:13 - will get exhibited if not the normal
05:15 - flow of the code will be get executed
05:17 - okay so here we are here we have stored
05:20 - age is 20 and 20 is greater than 18 so
05:24 - this is this will be evaluated as true
05:27 - and this block of code will be get
05:29 - executed and the age is greater than 18
05:32 - will be get printed on the console let's
05:34 - see if it gets printed
05:37 - so here you can see age is greater than
05:39 - 18 is getting printed on our console
05:41 - okay so this is the normal if statement
05:44 - I will just comment it out and now let's
05:47 - talk about the if else okay
05:50 - uh this is a code that I have written
05:52 - okay if else so here I have created one
05:56 - variable called year I haven't I have
05:58 - assigned value to it uh 2020 and if I I
06:03 - have to check whether that year is a
06:05 - leap year or a common year okay so for
06:07 - checking the leaf here here we are
06:09 - taking here mod 4 is equal to equals to
06:12 - zero and year mod 100 is not equals to
06:15 - zero and this whole uh guys you can you
06:18 - can see this whole let me highlight and
06:22 - this whole condition is one condition
06:24 - and it it is being checked with the
06:27 - another condition that is year mod
06:29 - of 400 is equal to equal to 0 okay and
06:33 - this is the or operator which gets
06:35 - evaluated at true if any one of the
06:38 - condition of these two is evaluated as
06:42 - true okay so let's suppose uh this
06:46 - this block of code is evaluated as true
06:49 - and this evaluated as false then overall
06:52 - if statement will be evaluated as true
06:54 - okay so so this if this is true then it
06:59 - will print the leap year and if this is
07:01 - not true else part will will be get
07:04 - executed as common here so let's run it
07:09 - and see so here you can see it is
07:12 - telling that you know year 2020 is a
07:14 - leap year let's write okay
07:17 - so moving next we will be seeing if else
07:21 - if ladder
07:23 - okay so let me just comment it out
07:29 - and comment it and comment this okay so
07:33 - here we are check simply checking the
07:35 - grade of the student okay so here is the
07:38 - marks which are obtained by a student
07:40 - inside an examination okay so we are
07:42 - first we are checking whether the marks
07:43 - is less than 50 if if the marks is less
07:45 - than 50 this is simply the student is
07:47 - fail in that examination and if the Mark
07:50 - is greater than 50 and Mark is less than
07:54 - 60 that means uh and we use and operator
07:57 - when and this and operator will be
08:00 - evaluated evaluated as true if the both
08:03 - of the condition are getting true so now
08:06 - if the student Mark says uh anywhere
08:09 - between 51 to 659 then that student will
08:14 - be great get the grade D okay similarly
08:18 - C grade is there b grade is there and a
08:20 - grade is there and a A plus grade is
08:22 - there and if any if any one of this
08:26 - condition is not getting uh true then
08:28 - else part will be evaluated which is
08:30 - invalid that that means the marks you
08:33 - have that we have entered here is
08:35 - invalid okay so if I click run
08:40 - secret because why it is printing the
08:42 - secret since the max is 65 which lies
08:45 - between the 61 to 69 that is this block
08:49 - of code okay so that's why C grade is
08:52 - printing on the console okay so this is
08:55 - the normal if else ladder is there and
09:00 - now let's go and check nested if
09:02 - statements okay so I have declared two
09:05 - variables name age and weight and I have
09:07 - assigned to them value as 20 and 80 okay
09:10 - and applying condition on age and weight
09:12 - so first of all I am checking that if
09:15 - the age of the user is greater than or
09:18 - equal to 18 it's okay so in that case uh
09:21 - our age is 20 which is greater than
09:22 - equals to which is greater than uh 18.
09:26 - and again we are checking one one if
09:29 - statement where we are checking weight
09:31 - is greater than 50 and in our case our
09:34 - weight is 80 which is greater than 50 so
09:37 - this statement will be executed and
09:41 - printed on the console let me check
09:45 - so here you can see you are eligible to
09:47 - donate blood
09:49 - okay
09:50 - so this is the concept behind if else in
09:55 - Java so I hope you have get some idea
09:58 - about if else statements in Java

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back guys to the another video of the Java tutorial series wherein in this video we will be learning about Java if Health statements so today onwards we are starting about the conditional statements in uh Java so conditional statements are nothing but the statements which which get executed if the certain condition match okay so there are basically four types in inside it if statement if a statement if else if ladder and nested if still statements will be seeing one after one each other so okay so first Java if is there so in if we declare if and inside if we write some condition if that condition becomes true the code inside that Curly braces will get executed okay so flow of this if statement is run like this so our code gets started and in the first condition gets checked if the condition is false then it if it it will not execute that part of the code and it will get execution is get towards that below that Curly basis and if that condition gets true if code is will get executed okay so uh we will be saying the code implementation also let us first uh try to understand theoretically what is what are those forced types are actually mean okay so Java if else is there anything if else there is else condition is also there so if the condition of the if statement is not true that is its false then else condition will be get executed like here if you can see condition if the condition is true the code the code will get executed inside the if if if block and if the condition is false then the code inside the else Port is getting executed here also you can see uh the program flow comes here condition is getting checked if the condition is false then else code will be get executed and execution get uh successfully done and if the condition is getting true then if code is getting executed okay so next comes Java if else if ladder so it's like a ladder okay so here you can see if condition is there if this condition is not getting executed then if else else if is there so condition another condition is getting checked here okay so if condition 2 is true then this part of the lcf is getting executed so again else one one more lcf is there that is condition three is there if that condition 3 is getting true then this block will be get executed okay and you can declare as many uh else if condition you want and at the last I have declared one else condition that is you all know that will get executed if all those if and else if are generated as false statements okay so let us try to understand why this tray diagram so condition one is there if it is false condition two uh two will be get checked if again it is false condition uh like that and number of condition that you declare inside the code will get checked and any of these any one of this if it is get true then that corresponding statements or the block of the code will be get executed and the program flow will be get uh continued okay if all those else if and else if get false then the else part will be con executed okay so now nested if uh is another concept inside Java so if condition is there inside if condition another if condition is there so we are checking if inside if okay so let us understand by this small exam or tree diagram is here uh so first condition is check if that condition is true if good if code is executed okay and inside that another condition is there that is another if if block is there if that condition true if code is there if that condition is gets getting false then a program code is altered to an outs outside if okay so this is the four types of the Java if else so let's move on move on to the IDE and try to implement each one of these okay so here I have created if else name if else class Java class Java file is there okay uh inside which I have implemented all those four types and I will try to explain you each one of it okay so I will comment it out okay let's try to understand a normal if statement is there okay I have declared an integer name age uh and if I need to Value as 20 okay and and we are checking the age okay if age is greater than 18 so this is the part which here you can see the condition part is there so this is the condition that is being checked and if this condition returns true then this block of code will be executed otherwise the book of code which is written outside this that is line number 12 which is getting which will be get executed if that condition getting false okay if that in condition gets true this will get exhibited if not the normal flow of the code will be get executed okay so here we are here we have stored age is 20 and 20 is greater than 18 so this is this will be evaluated as true and this block of code will be get executed and the age is greater than 18 will be get printed on the console let's see if it gets printed so here you can see age is greater than 18 is getting printed on our console okay so this is the normal if statement I will just comment it out and now let's talk about the if else okay uh this is a code that I have written okay if else so here I have created one variable called year I haven't I have assigned value to it uh 2020 and if I I have to check whether that year is a leap year or a common year okay so for checking the leaf here here we are taking here mod 4 is equal to equals to zero and year mod 100 is not equals to zero and this whole uh guys you can you can see this whole let me highlight and this whole condition is one condition and it it is being checked with the another condition that is year mod of 400 is equal to equal to 0 okay and this is the or operator which gets evaluated at true if any one of the condition of these two is evaluated as true okay so let's suppose uh this this block of code is evaluated as true and this evaluated as false then overall if statement will be evaluated as true okay so so this if this is true then it will print the leap year and if this is not true else part will will be get executed as common here so let's run it and see so here you can see it is telling that you know year 2020 is a leap year let's write okay so moving next we will be seeing if else if ladder okay so let me just comment it out and comment it and comment this okay so here we are check simply checking the grade of the student okay so here is the marks which are obtained by a student inside an examination okay so we are first we are checking whether the marks is less than 50 if if the marks is less than 50 this is simply the student is fail in that examination and if the Mark is greater than 50 and Mark is less than 60 that means uh and we use and operator when and this and operator will be evaluated evaluated as true if the both of the condition are getting true so now if the student Mark says uh anywhere between 51 to 659 then that student will be great get the grade D okay similarly C grade is there b grade is there and a grade is there and a A plus grade is there and if any if any one of this condition is not getting uh true then else part will be evaluated which is invalid that that means the marks you have that we have entered here is invalid okay so if I click run secret because why it is printing the secret since the max is 65 which lies between the 61 to 69 that is this block of code okay so that's why C grade is printing on the console okay so this is the normal if else ladder is there and now let's go and check nested if statements okay so I have declared two variables name age and weight and I have assigned to them value as 20 and 80 okay and applying condition on age and weight so first of all I am checking that if the age of the user is greater than or equal to 18 it's okay so in that case uh our age is 20 which is greater than equals to which is greater than uh 18. and again we are checking one one if statement where we are checking weight is greater than 50 and in our case our weight is 80 which is greater than 50 so this statement will be executed and printed on the console let me check so here you can see you are eligible to donate blood okay so this is the concept behind if else in Java so I hope you have get some idea about if else statements in Java
