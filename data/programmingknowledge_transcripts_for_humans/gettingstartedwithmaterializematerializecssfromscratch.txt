00:00 - hello we're back we are going to begin
00:04 - working on a CSS framework called
00:06 - materialize there are other frameworks
00:09 - out there another one that's very
00:10 - popular is called bootstrap you may have
00:13 - heard of it there are quite a few
00:16 - this one is materialized CSS calm so go
00:19 - ahead and go to their website and a
00:24 - framework is is a one way to add some
00:28 - some components to your site that you
00:33 - often have to add like a form or a
00:36 - navbar or buttons and these are very
00:38 - professional-looking and they're very
00:40 - easy to just grab and put into your site
00:42 - I I often use certain components I have
00:48 - never built an entire website using a
00:51 - framework I think it's a little bit too
00:53 - much of a shortcut and I don't think
00:56 - it's as professional as building your
00:57 - own and using your own creativity but I
00:59 - do like to use it for some of the
01:02 - constant features that you need like
01:05 - forms and nav bars and such so when I go
01:08 - to one of these sites I go over to the
01:11 - spot where it says components and click
01:15 - on it and see what they have so they
01:18 - have some of the same similar ones that
01:21 - others have they have badges buttons
01:23 - different things the ones I always
01:26 - gravitate to is navbar and forms and
01:31 - sometimes I've used cards in the past
01:33 - and they're just different things that
01:35 - you can add to your website so for
01:37 - example if you click on cards you will
01:41 - see what they I have to offer
01:44 - so they talk about what a card is and
01:47 - then they kind of show you examples of
01:49 - what it would look like so if you were
01:51 - wanting to add some informational parts
01:54 - to your site and you wanted a nice title
01:57 - and a little description and this is a
01:59 - link and this you know then it's just
02:01 - there it's just it's beautiful
02:02 - and then they could give you the code
02:04 - that you would use and this one's an
02:07 - image card so an image card where you
02:09 - would have an image and then you'd have
02:10 - some information
02:12 - and there's a link and it's just it's
02:14 - lovely and then they give you the code
02:15 - and all you have to do is copy and paste
02:17 - it into your site so we're gonna go look
02:20 - at navbar so let's do that first
02:22 - so let's go check out the nav bars and
02:29 - so you can again you can look at all the
02:31 - documentation and and basically just
02:34 - pick one that you like so I quickly took
02:37 - a look and I decided to grab something
02:40 - that was kind of simple so the one I
02:42 - picked was called centering the logo so
02:45 - this is the one I picked and they talked
02:47 - a little bit about it and then you can
02:49 - see an example of it and then you can
02:51 - see the code so all you're gonna have to
02:54 - do is copy and paste this code and put
02:56 - it into your into your web page so we're
03:00 - gonna go ahead and try it all right so
03:02 - I'm gonna go to my code and what I
03:04 - decided to do is I wanted to keep my old
03:09 - contact page that we had created
03:11 - together and if you go back and look at
03:15 - it it was here and I wanted to keep it
03:20 - because I wanted to keep the form that
03:22 - we had created together so what I've
03:25 - decided to do was create another contact
03:27 - page and so when I click on that one it
03:31 - takes me to this new one that we're
03:32 - gonna build together okay so if you go
03:36 - into your code let's go into our file
03:39 - and let's create another contact page so
03:44 - I'm actually going to create a third one
03:45 - since I already created the second one
03:47 - you're gonna create a second one I'm
03:49 - gonna create a third one so we're still
03:51 - still on the same page sort of okay so
03:54 - I'm going to go ahead and hit my new
03:56 - file and I'm gonna call this one
03:59 - contact 3 I know you know I'm going to
04:04 - cut I'm gonna call it contact demo
04:06 - because it's a demonstration okay dot
04:09 - HTML all right and you can kind of call
04:14 - yours whatever you want
04:16 - okay so here's my contact demo dot html'
04:19 - alright so what we're gonna do is what
04:21 - we usually do is type in html5 and get
04:26 - our boilerplate and I'm going to change
04:30 - the title in the meta head I'm gonna
04:34 - change it to demo contact you can call
04:38 - it contact two or whatever you want to
04:40 - call it actually you know what we can
04:42 - call it yeah let's do that
04:46 - demo contact I could say it's contact
04:49 - materialize or whatever
04:50 - okay all right so now what we need to do
04:55 - is we need to go back to our materialize
04:59 - and the first thing you need to do is
05:04 - let's go back to the home page so I'm
05:09 - just gonna go back to the home page I
05:12 - was at the cards now I got to go back to
05:14 - the home page alright so I'm gonna hit
05:18 - get I'm gonna click on get started now
05:23 - there are ways that you can grab it and
05:26 - one way is to download it but there's an
05:28 - easier and faster way we are going to
05:31 - use this thing called CDN all right so
05:35 - we're gonna copy and paste a few lines
05:37 - of code and that's how we're going to be
05:40 - able to use all of the features so the
05:42 - first line of code is the compiled and
05:45 - minified CSS the second one is caught is
05:48 - the JavaScript so let's do one at a time
05:51 - so let's start with the CSS one it's
05:54 - basically another it's like a link to a
05:56 - stylesheet so it's the CSS that they
05:59 - that they have built so we're going to
06:01 - go ahead and copy and paste it all
06:07 - and so control copy and I'm going to go
06:10 - back to my code and we're gonna be
06:13 - putting it in the head of our document
06:15 - so I'm gonna go right underneath my
06:17 - title and I'm just gonna paste it in
06:21 - okay so we got that the next thing I
06:24 - would like to paste in is I would like
06:26 - to paste in our own style sheet that we
06:30 - have created remember because we're
06:32 - gonna use some stuff in there as well so
06:34 - let's go ahead and just type in link and
06:37 - hit tab and then here we're gonna put in
06:41 - style the address style dot CSS so
06:47 - that's our folder where we're keeping
06:49 - our style sheet so that's the what we
06:52 - put there okay then we are going to go
06:56 - back to materialise and we are going to
07:01 - copy and paste the second line of code
07:04 - which is the script tag so I guess I
07:07 - have to go down here and copy and paste
07:11 - all right it doesn't want to work so I'm
07:15 - gonna start at the end it's very it's
07:18 - being very tricky okay there we go
07:23 - alright so ctrl C and I'm gonna go back
07:28 - to my code now we are not going to put
07:30 - this in the head we are gonna actually
07:32 - scroll down to right before the closing
07:35 - body tag and I'm just gonna kind of give
07:40 - us some space and I'm gonna copy it and
07:43 - paste it here
07:43 - I mean paste it here so the script tag
07:47 - needs to be pasted just in front of the
07:51 - closing body tag because you don't want
07:53 - your any JavaScript to load prior to
07:56 - your CSS or to load prior to the rest of
08:00 - the HTML page because it will slow down
08:04 - your page so everybody always puts the
08:07 - script tags at the bottom of the body
08:09 - tag the body the by area of the body
08:12 - right before the closing tag okay so now
08:17 - we have everything we need to get
08:19 - started
08:20 - all right so the first thing we want to
08:22 - do is we want to create a nav bar so
08:29 - let's go back to materialise and let's
08:33 - go back to our components and go to the
08:39 - nav bar component and we can get any one
08:45 - we want I have chosen to take the
08:48 - centering the logo one I did want to
08:52 - show you the active one this one's
08:54 - called active items I wanted to show
08:56 - that one to you first before we take the
08:58 - other one this one is very calm it's a
09:01 - this one's a popular one because it has
09:04 - this shading for an act for it's called
09:06 - the active link when you hover over
09:10 - links they get by default they're going
09:13 - to get shaded and that's a nice little
09:15 - feature and that's part of their styling
09:18 - the active part is what that stays
09:21 - shaded so it basically hey I'm on the
09:23 - home page so it's going to be shaded it
09:26 - whichever one you want to be constantly
09:28 - shaded and how they they make this
09:31 - happen
09:31 - is on that particular link the one they
09:36 - chose was the third one they just
09:38 - brought in active in parentheses as one
09:42 - of their classes and that just does it
09:44 - for them so at this moment I wanted to
09:47 - point out that the code that you're
09:49 - gonna be copying is stuff that you're
09:52 - gonna copy and paste into your HTML it's
09:54 - not something you put in your CSS
09:57 - because they're they already have their
10:01 - own CSS that's already by default part
10:04 - of this so we're putting all this in the
10:08 - HTML page and then it's going to
10:11 - automatically just have that style
10:13 - without doing anything in CSS all right
10:16 - so let's go up to the one I've chosen
10:19 - which is centering the logo so I'm just
10:23 - gonna go ahead and copy and paste all
10:25 - this code ctrl C go back to my code and
10:29 - I'm gonna just throw it in there
10:33 - roll V alright ok I'm gonna hit safe so
10:38 - I'm going to right-click and I'm gonna
10:42 - say open with live server so I can see
10:44 - it and ok so there we go we've got logo
10:48 - we got all this stuff this is what it
10:51 - looks like
10:51 - alright so this is my contact demo HTML
10:54 - page alright so what I need to do is I
10:58 - need to fix all the links so that
11:00 - they're correct and I need to connect it
11:05 - to my other navbar that I created you
11:10 - know so let's go ahead and do all that
11:12 - so the first thing I want to do is
11:14 - change the word logo to contact me all
11:20 - right
11:21 - and then let's see let's change this to
11:28 - index index dot HTML and let's change
11:34 - this to home so that's our homepage and
11:38 - then we're gonna do our about page about
11:43 - dot HTML and then we'll change this to
11:44 - about ok and then next we're gonna
11:50 - change this to our first contact page
11:56 - alright and this will say contact and
12:00 - then I'm gonna make another one so I'm
12:03 - going to copy and paste I'm gonna make
12:06 - another link copy it paste it and let's
12:12 - make this one called the contact well
12:14 - you know what I should probably link to
12:16 - all my contact pages so let's make that
12:18 - one to the contact - you don't have a
12:20 - contact - so I'll just put two here
12:23 - whoops and then I'm gonna do another one
12:25 - and this one's going to be made to
12:29 - contact demo 1 and this one is going to
12:33 - be demo contact ok so this one's got all
12:39 - of them and then what I need to do is
12:43 - save it but you know what else I need to
12:45 - do
12:46 - I am going to go to my contact to page
12:49 - just right here and I'm gonna I'm gonna
12:52 - add that link here oh I already did
12:56 - hahaha what that's what I need to do I
13:00 - need to add it here so that I can
13:01 - navigate back and forth to the different
13:04 - pages that I want to so this is a little
13:06 - bit more complex than it should be
13:07 - because I'm sure I have like three
13:09 - contact pages but you kind of get the
13:11 - idea alright so if I hit save let's go
13:15 - back
13:15 - alright so now it says contact me and
13:18 - then I've got all my links yay alright
13:23 - okay so did you notice that the nice
13:25 - feature that this one has is that these
13:27 - are shaded every time you hover alright
13:30 - so that's kinda nice now what happens if
13:33 - I change the color we can change the
13:36 - color we can do a lot of different
13:38 - things let's see we can make this move
13:42 - to the right we can make the links move
13:44 - to the right let me show you how to do
13:45 - that so let me go into my contact demo
13:49 - one all right so this is our new navbar
13:54 - okay we can't change nav wrapper we can
13:59 - change this and the reason I know that
14:01 - is I read the documentation so if you
14:03 - read the documentation in materialise it
14:06 - tells you kind of what you can do to
14:08 - change different things so this one says
14:10 - you can make it right left or Center so
14:12 - I'm going to turn it I'm gonna make it
14:13 - right hit save and it's going to make
14:17 - the logo go to the right which is way
14:19 - over here contact me
14:21 - alright I'm going to put it back to
14:24 - center because I like it better in the
14:25 - center and then the next thing we can
14:28 - change is this class left we can change
14:32 - that word to right and that's going to
14:35 - change the links and that's going to
14:38 - make those go to the right side now
14:40 - notice I'm not changing any of this
14:42 - stuff don't want to change any of that
14:44 - don't want to change a nav mobile so
14:46 - that you got to be selective about what
14:48 - you're changing you make sure you read
14:49 - the documentation so I think I saved it
14:53 - already but let's do it just just in
14:56 - case
14:57 - and all my links went to the right okay
15:00 - now in order to change the color the
15:02 - background color I'm actually going to
15:03 - have to do that in my seat in my CSS or
15:07 - our CSS so I'm going to go over to the
15:11 - style CSS but before I do that I'm going
15:14 - to notice that there's a class of nav
15:17 - wrapper okay so that means that's
15:22 - separate from the nav so I could target
15:25 - the nav wrapper and change the color of
15:29 - just this one and then the other ones
15:32 - can stay the aqua marine so let me show
15:35 - you what I mean so I'm going back to my
15:38 - CSS and I have my nav is set as
15:41 - aquamarine I can change that color and
15:45 - all mine ABS on every single page will
15:47 - change but if I want to change just the
15:49 - newest one then I'm gonna target just
15:52 - that one so I'm going to hit I'm gonna
15:54 - say dot nav - wrapper because that
16:00 - remember it was a class of nav dot
16:02 - wrapper or nav - wrapper so I'm gonna
16:04 - use the dot and then I'm going to give
16:08 - it a color so background color and it's
16:12 - going to be blue okay so if I hit save
16:18 - and I go back it's changed so those are
16:21 - the some of the ways that you can change
16:22 - your frameworks okay
16:26 - so in our next video we're gonna talk
16:28 - about we're going to actually learn how
16:30 - to add the form we're going to go back
16:34 - to materialise and we're going to go
16:36 - into the form area and we're gonna be
16:40 - putting the form in and we're also going
16:43 - to be looking at the icons let's see
16:47 - there's the icon so we're going to add
16:49 - some cute icons - all right so I'll see
16:52 - you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hello we're back we are going to begin working on a CSS framework called materialize there are other frameworks out there another one that's very popular is called bootstrap you may have heard of it there are quite a few this one is materialized CSS calm so go ahead and go to their website and a framework is is a one way to add some some components to your site that you often have to add like a form or a navbar or buttons and these are very professionallooking and they're very easy to just grab and put into your site I I often use certain components I have never built an entire website using a framework I think it's a little bit too much of a shortcut and I don't think it's as professional as building your own and using your own creativity but I do like to use it for some of the constant features that you need like forms and nav bars and such so when I go to one of these sites I go over to the spot where it says components and click on it and see what they have so they have some of the same similar ones that others have they have badges buttons different things the ones I always gravitate to is navbar and forms and sometimes I've used cards in the past and they're just different things that you can add to your website so for example if you click on cards you will see what they I have to offer so they talk about what a card is and then they kind of show you examples of what it would look like so if you were wanting to add some informational parts to your site and you wanted a nice title and a little description and this is a link and this you know then it's just there it's just it's beautiful and then they could give you the code that you would use and this one's an image card so an image card where you would have an image and then you'd have some information and there's a link and it's just it's lovely and then they give you the code and all you have to do is copy and paste it into your site so we're gonna go look at navbar so let's do that first so let's go check out the nav bars and so you can again you can look at all the documentation and and basically just pick one that you like so I quickly took a look and I decided to grab something that was kind of simple so the one I picked was called centering the logo so this is the one I picked and they talked a little bit about it and then you can see an example of it and then you can see the code so all you're gonna have to do is copy and paste this code and put it into your into your web page so we're gonna go ahead and try it all right so I'm gonna go to my code and what I decided to do is I wanted to keep my old contact page that we had created together and if you go back and look at it it was here and I wanted to keep it because I wanted to keep the form that we had created together so what I've decided to do was create another contact page and so when I click on that one it takes me to this new one that we're gonna build together okay so if you go into your code let's go into our file and let's create another contact page so I'm actually going to create a third one since I already created the second one you're gonna create a second one I'm gonna create a third one so we're still still on the same page sort of okay so I'm going to go ahead and hit my new file and I'm gonna call this one contact 3 I know you know I'm going to cut I'm gonna call it contact demo because it's a demonstration okay dot HTML all right and you can kind of call yours whatever you want okay so here's my contact demo dot html' alright so what we're gonna do is what we usually do is type in html5 and get our boilerplate and I'm going to change the title in the meta head I'm gonna change it to demo contact you can call it contact two or whatever you want to call it actually you know what we can call it yeah let's do that demo contact I could say it's contact materialize or whatever okay all right so now what we need to do is we need to go back to our materialize and the first thing you need to do is let's go back to the home page so I'm just gonna go back to the home page I was at the cards now I got to go back to the home page alright so I'm gonna hit get I'm gonna click on get started now there are ways that you can grab it and one way is to download it but there's an easier and faster way we are going to use this thing called CDN all right so we're gonna copy and paste a few lines of code and that's how we're going to be able to use all of the features so the first line of code is the compiled and minified CSS the second one is caught is the JavaScript so let's do one at a time so let's start with the CSS one it's basically another it's like a link to a stylesheet so it's the CSS that they that they have built so we're going to go ahead and copy and paste it all and so control copy and I'm going to go back to my code and we're gonna be putting it in the head of our document so I'm gonna go right underneath my title and I'm just gonna paste it in okay so we got that the next thing I would like to paste in is I would like to paste in our own style sheet that we have created remember because we're gonna use some stuff in there as well so let's go ahead and just type in link and hit tab and then here we're gonna put in style the address style dot CSS so that's our folder where we're keeping our style sheet so that's the what we put there okay then we are going to go back to materialise and we are going to copy and paste the second line of code which is the script tag so I guess I have to go down here and copy and paste all right it doesn't want to work so I'm gonna start at the end it's very it's being very tricky okay there we go alright so ctrl C and I'm gonna go back to my code now we are not going to put this in the head we are gonna actually scroll down to right before the closing body tag and I'm just gonna kind of give us some space and I'm gonna copy it and paste it here I mean paste it here so the script tag needs to be pasted just in front of the closing body tag because you don't want your any JavaScript to load prior to your CSS or to load prior to the rest of the HTML page because it will slow down your page so everybody always puts the script tags at the bottom of the body tag the body the by area of the body right before the closing tag okay so now we have everything we need to get started all right so the first thing we want to do is we want to create a nav bar so let's go back to materialise and let's go back to our components and go to the nav bar component and we can get any one we want I have chosen to take the centering the logo one I did want to show you the active one this one's called active items I wanted to show that one to you first before we take the other one this one is very calm it's a this one's a popular one because it has this shading for an act for it's called the active link when you hover over links they get by default they're going to get shaded and that's a nice little feature and that's part of their styling the active part is what that stays shaded so it basically hey I'm on the home page so it's going to be shaded it whichever one you want to be constantly shaded and how they they make this happen is on that particular link the one they chose was the third one they just brought in active in parentheses as one of their classes and that just does it for them so at this moment I wanted to point out that the code that you're gonna be copying is stuff that you're gonna copy and paste into your HTML it's not something you put in your CSS because they're they already have their own CSS that's already by default part of this so we're putting all this in the HTML page and then it's going to automatically just have that style without doing anything in CSS all right so let's go up to the one I've chosen which is centering the logo so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy and paste all this code ctrl C go back to my code and I'm gonna just throw it in there roll V alright ok I'm gonna hit safe so I'm going to rightclick and I'm gonna say open with live server so I can see it and ok so there we go we've got logo we got all this stuff this is what it looks like alright so this is my contact demo HTML page alright so what I need to do is I need to fix all the links so that they're correct and I need to connect it to my other navbar that I created you know so let's go ahead and do all that so the first thing I want to do is change the word logo to contact me all right and then let's see let's change this to index index dot HTML and let's change this to home so that's our homepage and then we're gonna do our about page about dot HTML and then we'll change this to about ok and then next we're gonna change this to our first contact page alright and this will say contact and then I'm gonna make another one so I'm going to copy and paste I'm gonna make another link copy it paste it and let's make this one called the contact well you know what I should probably link to all my contact pages so let's make that one to the contact you don't have a contact so I'll just put two here whoops and then I'm gonna do another one and this one's going to be made to contact demo 1 and this one is going to be demo contact ok so this one's got all of them and then what I need to do is save it but you know what else I need to do I am going to go to my contact to page just right here and I'm gonna I'm gonna add that link here oh I already did hahaha what that's what I need to do I need to add it here so that I can navigate back and forth to the different pages that I want to so this is a little bit more complex than it should be because I'm sure I have like three contact pages but you kind of get the idea alright so if I hit save let's go back alright so now it says contact me and then I've got all my links yay alright okay so did you notice that the nice feature that this one has is that these are shaded every time you hover alright so that's kinda nice now what happens if I change the color we can change the color we can do a lot of different things let's see we can make this move to the right we can make the links move to the right let me show you how to do that so let me go into my contact demo one all right so this is our new navbar okay we can't change nav wrapper we can change this and the reason I know that is I read the documentation so if you read the documentation in materialise it tells you kind of what you can do to change different things so this one says you can make it right left or Center so I'm going to turn it I'm gonna make it right hit save and it's going to make the logo go to the right which is way over here contact me alright I'm going to put it back to center because I like it better in the center and then the next thing we can change is this class left we can change that word to right and that's going to change the links and that's going to make those go to the right side now notice I'm not changing any of this stuff don't want to change any of that don't want to change a nav mobile so that you got to be selective about what you're changing you make sure you read the documentation so I think I saved it already but let's do it just just in case and all my links went to the right okay now in order to change the color the background color I'm actually going to have to do that in my seat in my CSS or our CSS so I'm going to go over to the style CSS but before I do that I'm going to notice that there's a class of nav wrapper okay so that means that's separate from the nav so I could target the nav wrapper and change the color of just this one and then the other ones can stay the aqua marine so let me show you what I mean so I'm going back to my CSS and I have my nav is set as aquamarine I can change that color and all mine ABS on every single page will change but if I want to change just the newest one then I'm gonna target just that one so I'm going to hit I'm gonna say dot nav wrapper because that remember it was a class of nav dot wrapper or nav wrapper so I'm gonna use the dot and then I'm going to give it a color so background color and it's going to be blue okay so if I hit save and I go back it's changed so those are the some of the ways that you can change your frameworks okay so in our next video we're gonna talk about we're going to actually learn how to add the form we're going to go back to materialise and we're going to go into the form area and we're gonna be putting the form in and we're also going to be looking at the icons let's see there's the icon so we're going to add some cute icons all right so I'll see you in the next video
