00:00 - now in this video we'll be talking about
00:02 - the nested function okay so actually I
00:04 - have already created the file with the
00:06 - name 20 underscore instead function let
00:08 - me just to paste the thing hashed like
00:11 - she Bank okay and now let me discuss
00:14 - about like basic idea what is the nested
00:16 - function so it basically means as the
00:17 - name suggests you can uh guess like we
00:20 - will just calling
00:22 - function inside a function
00:26 - inside a function not calling also we
00:29 - can say like we can write also function
00:31 - inside a function okay so let me just
00:34 - discuss about the same thing suppose I
00:36 - create one function demo and here I just
00:40 - Echo something like this is a demo
00:42 - function
00:44 - this is a demo function and again I
00:48 - create one more function that is the
00:49 - demo 2 and here I'm writing Eco this is
00:53 - uh
00:55 - sorry this is a demo 2 function okay
01:00 - and now what will happen I will simply
01:02 - call this function demo here okay and
01:04 - demo to below okay
01:08 - so I will just give the permission for
01:10 - this file
01:13 - okay clear the screen dot slash 20 okay
01:16 - now now we are good to go ahead you can
01:18 - see the both the function has been
01:20 - called okay so it is this is the basic
01:22 - thing okay but now what I will do I will
01:24 - just uh
01:26 - call this function inside inside this
01:28 - function
01:30 - oh sorry
01:31 - demo 2.
01:33 - demo 2 okay so now what will happen it
01:35 - will basically call the function
01:38 - okay so here what happens the demo
01:40 - function has been called so here it saw
01:43 - like we have to Eco so we decode this
01:45 - part and again you check demo two
01:47 - function is also called so it gets the
01:50 - uh print the content of this demo to
01:51 - function so in this way uh uh our this
01:55 - nested function works but what if you
01:58 - want to call uh
02:01 - but what if you want to call the uh like
02:05 - uh not call
02:07 - if you want to write the function inside
02:08 - a function so now here what I can do I
02:11 - can just call this this function here
02:13 - also double two
02:15 - and clear the screen and again we will
02:17 - get the same result okay this is the
02:19 - demo2 function
02:20 - okay
02:22 - so now what I will do
02:26 - um we will take the one use case of
02:28 - summation and addition sorry summation
02:31 - and subtraction okay and we will work on
02:34 - those things okay so I hope you got the
02:37 - idea about how everything works so let
02:38 - me just comment out these things and I
02:41 - will create the parameterized function
02:42 - that is first I will get the sum
02:45 - and here I will
02:47 - Echo the sum off and I will pass the
02:51 - dollar one and dollar two
02:53 - is
02:55 - and here I will just do the computation
02:57 - part that is the dollar uh dollar one
03:01 - plus dollar two okay
03:04 - and let me first check whether the thing
03:06 - is working or sum 2 and 4 and
03:11 - dot slash 20 and okay yeah it is working
03:14 - the summer 246 okay so now I will what I
03:17 - will do I will just create a soft
03:20 - function also here and I will just Echo
03:25 - the sum of not sum the sub the
03:30 - difference of
03:34 - dollar one and dollar two is
03:38 - and here we will do the computation path
03:40 - that is the dollar one minus dollar two
03:45 - okay and then we will just call the
03:49 - function inside the sum function that is
03:51 - sub 4 and 2.
03:53 - okay
03:55 - so let me just clear the screen again
03:57 - and hit enter so here you can see the
04:00 - sum of 4 and 2 is 2 yeah sorry I have
04:05 - done something yeah
04:06 - let me just uh give it proper space
04:10 - and clear the screen and yeah we are
04:13 - good to go now here you can see the sum
04:14 - of 2 and 46 we have passed 2 and 4 here
04:17 - and we are getting result from a 2046
04:19 - and subtraction of 4 minus 2 that is
04:22 - equal to 2 so we are getting the exact
04:24 - reason let me change the value and I
04:25 - will write 80 here
04:27 - uh
04:28 - 80. and here I will do like 40 okay
04:37 - so here you can see we are getting the
04:39 - same result like expected is all we are
04:41 - getting okay
04:42 - so in this way we can do the uh nested
04:45 - function and all those things okay so I
04:48 - hope you liked it and I hope you got the
04:50 - idea about how the nested function works
04:52 - okay so that's all for today's video
04:54 - guys and I hope you liked it and if you
04:57 - have any query you can ask us in the
04:58 - comment section and you will get the all
05:00 - the source code in our GitHub repository
05:02 - and you will get the link in the
05:03 - description
05:04 - so thank you for watching and I'll meet
05:06 - you in the next video thank you bye

now in this video we'll be talking about the nested function okay so actually I have already created the file with the name 20 underscore instead function let me just to paste the thing hashed like she Bank okay and now let me discuss about like basic idea what is the nested function so it basically means as the name suggests you can uh guess like we will just calling function inside a function inside a function not calling also we can say like we can write also function inside a function okay so let me just discuss about the same thing suppose I create one function demo and here I just Echo something like this is a demo function this is a demo function and again I create one more function that is the demo 2 and here I'm writing Eco this is uh sorry this is a demo 2 function okay and now what will happen I will simply call this function demo here okay and demo to below okay so I will just give the permission for this file okay clear the screen dot slash 20 okay now now we are good to go ahead you can see the both the function has been called okay so it is this is the basic thing okay but now what I will do I will just uh call this function inside inside this function oh sorry demo 2. demo 2 okay so now what will happen it will basically call the function okay so here what happens the demo function has been called so here it saw like we have to Eco so we decode this part and again you check demo two function is also called so it gets the uh print the content of this demo to function so in this way uh uh our this nested function works but what if you want to call uh but what if you want to call the uh like uh not call if you want to write the function inside a function so now here what I can do I can just call this this function here also double two and clear the screen and again we will get the same result okay this is the demo2 function okay so now what I will do um we will take the one use case of summation and addition sorry summation and subtraction okay and we will work on those things okay so I hope you got the idea about how everything works so let me just comment out these things and I will create the parameterized function that is first I will get the sum and here I will Echo the sum off and I will pass the dollar one and dollar two is and here I will just do the computation part that is the dollar uh dollar one plus dollar two okay and let me first check whether the thing is working or sum 2 and 4 and dot slash 20 and okay yeah it is working the summer 246 okay so now I will what I will do I will just create a soft function also here and I will just Echo the sum of not sum the sub the difference of dollar one and dollar two is and here we will do the computation path that is the dollar one minus dollar two okay and then we will just call the function inside the sum function that is sub 4 and 2. okay so let me just clear the screen again and hit enter so here you can see the sum of 4 and 2 is 2 yeah sorry I have done something yeah let me just uh give it proper space and clear the screen and yeah we are good to go now here you can see the sum of 2 and 46 we have passed 2 and 4 here and we are getting result from a 2046 and subtraction of 4 minus 2 that is equal to 2 so we are getting the exact reason let me change the value and I will write 80 here uh 80. and here I will do like 40 okay so here you can see we are getting the same result like expected is all we are getting okay so in this way we can do the uh nested function and all those things okay so I hope you liked it and I hope you got the idea about how the nested function works okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any query you can ask us in the comment section and you will get the all the source code in our GitHub repository and you will get the link in the description so thank you for watching and I'll meet you in the next video thank you bye
