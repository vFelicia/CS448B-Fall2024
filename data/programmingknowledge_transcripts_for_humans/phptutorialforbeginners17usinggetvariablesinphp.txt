00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - get variable in your PHP script so first
00:09 - of all uh I will make a new document and
00:12 - I will save it as for
00:15 - example
00:16 - get.
00:18 - PHP and I will save it and in here first
00:22 - of all I will give you a little demo of
00:25 - get how to declare get variable in PHP
00:29 - so we we can declare this get variable
00:32 - like this we just need uh the S dollar
00:36 - symbol and then this underscore and
00:39 - whatever you write whenever this um
00:44 - variable starts from underscore it's
00:46 - generally a super user variable or or
00:50 - the variable provided by your PHP script
00:54 - so just we just write in capital letters
00:59 - and we just use these um square brackets
01:03 - to get the values and in here comes the
01:08 - name of the index you are expecting so
01:10 - for example I can just name it as name
01:15 - and I can save it okay and this get is
01:20 - also called a super Global variable or
01:24 - automatic Global variable this simply
01:27 - means that it is available in all the
01:31 - Scopes throughout your PR PHP script so
01:34 - you can use it anywhere in your PHP
01:37 - script right it's a global variable now
01:41 - how to use this get method so for
01:44 - example I want to
01:47 - Echo whatever is passed as a value of
01:52 - name so this get will be uh will be
01:56 - catching the name which is passed from
02:00 - your url I will save it and I will give
02:02 - you a demo so now I have this get. PHP I
02:08 - will click it and first of all it will
02:10 - give me an error because I'm not passing
02:14 - the value which it it is expecting so
02:17 - what I'm going to do is I will just in
02:21 - my URL just go to your url here this is
02:25 - My URL and give a question mark here so
02:29 - give this question mark and then give
02:32 - the name of your variable which is name
02:35 - in our case actually just uh we will we
02:39 - can change it as
02:42 - store name so it doesn't conflict so in
02:47 - our case this is St name okay and after
02:52 - this question mark so you have your url
02:55 - just give a question mark then give the
02:57 - name of your variable you are which you
03:00 - are expecting here and then give the
03:03 - value of uh that variable or key so you
03:09 - need to give question mark the variable
03:11 - name or key name then give this equal to
03:14 - sign here and then give the Val value so
03:19 - for example I pass it Mark here and
03:23 - press
03:24 - enter you will be able to
03:27 - see uh let's see what's the problem
03:33 - here okay so this I think this key
03:36 - should be in double quotes in instead of
03:39 - these single Cotes and then it can
03:43 - process the name of this variable so I
03:46 - will pass the same uh query once again
03:51 - question mark and then the name of your
03:54 - variable which is store name is equal to
03:57 - the value which you want to give so for
03:59 - for example I want to pass student name
04:01 - is equal to Mark here and I just reload
04:05 - this and I will be able to see Mark here
04:08 - so this is really showing the dynamic
04:12 - nature of PHP so whatever you are
04:15 - passing as a
04:16 - URL as a value it's printing the
04:20 - value uh in your PHP page okay or it's
04:24 - returning the value as a result now to
04:28 - make this uh uh this execution little
04:32 - bit more interactive and user friendly
04:36 - uh what I want to do is I will just
04:39 - create a new PHP page for example I will
04:43 - save it
04:46 - as for example
04:49 - student
04:51 - student. PHP okay and in here I'll just
04:58 - start my
05:00 - PHP code
05:03 - PHP
05:05 - and in here I will just close it and for
05:09 - example in here or I don't even need to
05:12 - do this I will just make a HTML form
05:16 - which can uh take some values so if you
05:19 - have a little bit knowledge of HTML uh
05:23 - you will know what the form is uh and if
05:27 - you even don't have that knowledge I
05:28 - will just show you how to make a simple
05:31 - form
05:32 - here so you just need to make this kind
05:35 - of a form
05:37 - HTML code starts from this HTML tags I
05:42 - think most of you just know this and
05:46 - then it has the body it has the head
05:49 - which I'm not using right now and in the
05:51 - body you can provide your tags uh
05:54 - whatever you want to print okay so this
05:57 - is the basic skeleton of HTML code right
06:01 - and I want to print uh student info in
06:05 - uh in this form okay so I will just make
06:09 - a form inside my
06:12 - HTML page so I will just write
06:15 - form and I will just end this form
06:22 - first form and in here I will just
06:28 - give
06:30 - the path of my uh file which I want to
06:33 - invoke from this HTML page which is get.
06:37 - PHP so in this form
06:41 - action
06:44 - action is equal to uh I will pass the
06:48 - name of my PHP file which is get. PHP
06:52 - right get.
06:54 - PHP get. PHP for example so this is the
06:59 - path of my PHP file I'm telling this
07:01 - form to call okay and then I will give
07:06 - the
07:08 - method so you can call different method
07:12 - uh using this form submission and
07:15 - because we are learning get variable we
07:18 - will call a get method from here so just
07:21 - write get here but
07:24 - in double
07:27 - quotes and basically in this form what
07:30 - we want is we want to submit the name of
07:33 - the student the age of the student and
07:37 - the weight of the student for example so
07:41 - we have this title called student info
07:44 - and in the capital letter or in bold we
07:48 - can just uh
07:50 - pass
07:53 - name in
07:55 - bold and similarly we can do
07:59 - the same
08:01 - for age and
08:05 - weight
08:09 - age wait and in here after this um
08:15 - name I can just pass some name here so I
08:20 - will use input tag
08:23 - to give the
08:26 - input input and and the type type will
08:31 - be a text box so just write type is
08:34 - equal to in double quotes
08:38 - text text and
08:41 - the name of this uh input we will name
08:45 - it as for example name itself
08:49 - okay is equal to is equal
08:54 - to for example St
08:58 - name
09:00 - store name and this Stu name is the same
09:05 - as this Stu name so just copy this and
09:09 - paste it here okay in a similar way I
09:12 - will pass the
09:14 - age
09:16 - and the weight okay so this will be all
09:21 - text but this will be
09:23 - s age for example and this will be
09:28 - Stu
09:30 - weight okay and the same tag I can use
09:33 - it here so for
09:35 - example I can Echo this plus this plus
09:40 - this and this should be
09:44 - age age and
09:50 - weight weight but uh let's concatenate
09:56 - let's use concatenate operation and just
10:00 - print
10:01 - name and
10:04 - Dot and here we will give our
10:09 - break
10:10 - BR and same we will do here and here for
10:15 - printing
10:17 - age and for
10:21 - printing
10:22 - weight and we will use this break here
10:26 - and maybe here also okay so this is a
10:29 - simple form I will save this form and I
10:32 - will just uh request this form from here
10:36 - go back go back and refresh it I have
10:40 - the student. PHP I can call it and you
10:43 - can see I can I have the simple
10:45 - form and I can see name and this text
10:48 - box age than this text box and weight
10:51 - than this text box and I want a little
10:54 - button also so first of all I will
10:57 - provide a break
11:00 - here so I can see a button on the next
11:02 - line and then I can provide once again
11:10 - input but this time this will be a
11:13 - button so I will just say
11:16 - type type is equal to
11:20 - submit
11:22 - okay submit so this will be a button and
11:27 - once again when we refresh our
11:30 - code you can see submit query right so
11:35 - we have a PHP page in which we have some
11:39 - HTML code and we are expecting student
11:44 - name age and wait and we want to submit
11:46 - this and this because we have uh
11:51 - provided the path of the PHP file as an
11:53 - action it'll go to this PHP file and it
11:57 - will see if if uh this student name is
12:00 - there and then it will print student
12:02 - name age and weight let's see what what
12:05 - happens so I will just write Mark as
12:08 - name and age as 19 and weight 46 and I
12:15 - submit this and I see some problem here
12:20 - let's see what's the
12:23 - problem yeah so problem is single quotes
12:26 - here sometimes I forget this
12:29 - but don't forget
12:31 - this okay so once again we go back we
12:35 - have name Mark age 19 weight 46 submit
12:39 - and now we can see name is equal to Mark
12:42 - age is equal to 19 and weight is equal
12:45 - to 46 and you can even see this uh URL
12:50 - modification that St name is equal to
12:53 - Mark and this little end symbol is just
12:57 - provided by uh PHP and this end
13:02 - represent that there are more than one
13:05 - variable you are passing in this get
13:08 - request and then we have our second
13:12 - variable St age is equal to 19 and then
13:15 - we have third variable which is s weight
13:18 - is equal to 46 so this is the request
13:21 - get request you are passing to your PHP
13:24 - page and then this request comes to your
13:27 - PHP page and this is printed according
13:31 - like this right but for example you
13:35 - don't even pass anything here I will
13:39 - just for example I will just leave it as
13:42 - blank what happens it just print
13:46 - blank blank uh names and age and weight
13:51 - right for example if you don't want to
13:54 - uh you know uh want user to uh do
13:57 - something like this what you get can do
13:59 - here
14:01 - is you can use another is uh another Glo
14:06 - Global variable in if condition so I
14:09 - will just give if and this is a pre
14:14 - defined variable which is called is set
14:18 - and it just check that if the value of
14:22 - the variable is set or not so we want to
14:25 - check if the value of
14:27 - get
14:29 - student name is set or not so I will
14:32 - just write it like this and I also want
14:36 - that so I will give this
14:38 - ands symbol here I have shown you how to
14:42 - use this m and and these logical and
14:46 - comparison operators in uh the early
14:49 - earlier videos right so and then I also
14:53 - want to check whether my age field is
14:57 - has some value or not and in the same
15:01 - way I want to check my weight field has
15:05 - some value or not and if they have some
15:08 - value I want to print
15:11 - it otherwise
15:14 - else I will just say
15:19 - that I will just
15:22 - Echo please enter all
15:25 - field please enter
15:30 - all Fields okay so now when
15:35 - I submit this form as blank I will just
15:40 - submit it and it
15:42 - says you can use null not equal to let's
15:47 - see what's the problem
15:49 - here is
15:52 - set okay so I know the problem we need
15:56 - to this use this is at
15:59 - function for every get method so I will
16:02 - use with this is
16:04 - Set uh with this get method and is set
16:09 - with this get method okay now once again
16:13 - let's
16:14 - try and I will just reload my page and
16:17 - submit this and now I can get this uh
16:22 - name because I also need to check
16:26 - whether these names are empty or not so
16:29 - what I can do here is I can
16:33 - declare name variable is equal
16:37 - to get student
16:41 - name in a similar way I can
16:46 - declare
16:48 - age
16:51 - and weight it takes student age and
16:55 - student
16:56 - weight and I will check one more thing
17:00 - if and there is one more function
17:03 - inbuild function in PHP which is empty
17:07 - function so it checks whether your
17:09 - variable is empty or not so I will just
17:15 - say so if not
17:18 - empty you see I have given this not
17:21 - symbol here right so if this name
17:24 - variable is not empty then
17:30 - and once again I will just copy this two
17:35 - times more and for age and the weight
17:41 - and if name is not empty age is not
17:44 - empty and weight is not empty then I
17:47 - want to print this okay I'll just
17:52 - inclose this form uh or this if if
17:56 - condition and once again when I try try
17:58 - to run this hopefully it will run once
18:02 - again reload pass it uh says some
18:10 - error yeah
18:12 - because this get is missing this and and
18:16 - symbol right and
18:18 - symbol and symbol save it once again go
18:23 - back and hopefully this time it will
18:25 - work so we see nothing here right
18:29 - because we have submitted nothing as a
18:33 - here right but we we are not able to see
18:38 - this this uh please enter all Fields
18:41 - because I think this else should move
18:45 - after this so This else condition should
18:47 - be else condition for this if condition
18:51 - other than rather than this okay and
18:55 - once
18:56 - again and qu
18:59 - and it says please enter all the values
19:01 - right but whenever we provide some value
19:05 - for example name age and weight and it
19:08 - prints the values okay so when no values
19:12 - are printed or when no value is
19:15 - submitted by Form it says please enter
19:17 - all the values and when we enter of when
19:21 - we submit some values and pass the query
19:25 - it prints the it prints the name age and
19:29 - weight and you can also see the
19:31 - modification in the URL which is uh done
19:35 - by PHP so in this way you can use get
19:38 - variable in your PHP script I hope you
19:41 - have enjoyed this video please wait
19:42 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how to use get variable in your PHP script so first of all uh I will make a new document and I will save it as for example get. PHP and I will save it and in here first of all I will give you a little demo of get how to declare get variable in PHP so we we can declare this get variable like this we just need uh the S dollar symbol and then this underscore and whatever you write whenever this um variable starts from underscore it's generally a super user variable or or the variable provided by your PHP script so just we just write in capital letters and we just use these um square brackets to get the values and in here comes the name of the index you are expecting so for example I can just name it as name and I can save it okay and this get is also called a super Global variable or automatic Global variable this simply means that it is available in all the Scopes throughout your PR PHP script so you can use it anywhere in your PHP script right it's a global variable now how to use this get method so for example I want to Echo whatever is passed as a value of name so this get will be uh will be catching the name which is passed from your url I will save it and I will give you a demo so now I have this get. PHP I will click it and first of all it will give me an error because I'm not passing the value which it it is expecting so what I'm going to do is I will just in my URL just go to your url here this is My URL and give a question mark here so give this question mark and then give the name of your variable which is name in our case actually just uh we will we can change it as store name so it doesn't conflict so in our case this is St name okay and after this question mark so you have your url just give a question mark then give the name of your variable you are which you are expecting here and then give the value of uh that variable or key so you need to give question mark the variable name or key name then give this equal to sign here and then give the Val value so for example I pass it Mark here and press enter you will be able to see uh let's see what's the problem here okay so this I think this key should be in double quotes in instead of these single Cotes and then it can process the name of this variable so I will pass the same uh query once again question mark and then the name of your variable which is store name is equal to the value which you want to give so for for example I want to pass student name is equal to Mark here and I just reload this and I will be able to see Mark here so this is really showing the dynamic nature of PHP so whatever you are passing as a URL as a value it's printing the value uh in your PHP page okay or it's returning the value as a result now to make this uh uh this execution little bit more interactive and user friendly uh what I want to do is I will just create a new PHP page for example I will save it as for example student student. PHP okay and in here I'll just start my PHP code PHP and in here I will just close it and for example in here or I don't even need to do this I will just make a HTML form which can uh take some values so if you have a little bit knowledge of HTML uh you will know what the form is uh and if you even don't have that knowledge I will just show you how to make a simple form here so you just need to make this kind of a form HTML code starts from this HTML tags I think most of you just know this and then it has the body it has the head which I'm not using right now and in the body you can provide your tags uh whatever you want to print okay so this is the basic skeleton of HTML code right and I want to print uh student info in uh in this form okay so I will just make a form inside my HTML page so I will just write form and I will just end this form first form and in here I will just give the path of my uh file which I want to invoke from this HTML page which is get. PHP so in this form action action is equal to uh I will pass the name of my PHP file which is get. PHP right get. PHP get. PHP for example so this is the path of my PHP file I'm telling this form to call okay and then I will give the method so you can call different method uh using this form submission and because we are learning get variable we will call a get method from here so just write get here but in double quotes and basically in this form what we want is we want to submit the name of the student the age of the student and the weight of the student for example so we have this title called student info and in the capital letter or in bold we can just uh pass name in bold and similarly we can do the same for age and weight age wait and in here after this um name I can just pass some name here so I will use input tag to give the input input and and the type type will be a text box so just write type is equal to in double quotes text text and the name of this uh input we will name it as for example name itself okay is equal to is equal to for example St name store name and this Stu name is the same as this Stu name so just copy this and paste it here okay in a similar way I will pass the age and the weight okay so this will be all text but this will be s age for example and this will be Stu weight okay and the same tag I can use it here so for example I can Echo this plus this plus this and this should be age age and weight weight but uh let's concatenate let's use concatenate operation and just print name and Dot and here we will give our break BR and same we will do here and here for printing age and for printing weight and we will use this break here and maybe here also okay so this is a simple form I will save this form and I will just uh request this form from here go back go back and refresh it I have the student. PHP I can call it and you can see I can I have the simple form and I can see name and this text box age than this text box and weight than this text box and I want a little button also so first of all I will provide a break here so I can see a button on the next line and then I can provide once again input but this time this will be a button so I will just say type type is equal to submit okay submit so this will be a button and once again when we refresh our code you can see submit query right so we have a PHP page in which we have some HTML code and we are expecting student name age and wait and we want to submit this and this because we have uh provided the path of the PHP file as an action it'll go to this PHP file and it will see if if uh this student name is there and then it will print student name age and weight let's see what what happens so I will just write Mark as name and age as 19 and weight 46 and I submit this and I see some problem here let's see what's the problem yeah so problem is single quotes here sometimes I forget this but don't forget this okay so once again we go back we have name Mark age 19 weight 46 submit and now we can see name is equal to Mark age is equal to 19 and weight is equal to 46 and you can even see this uh URL modification that St name is equal to Mark and this little end symbol is just provided by uh PHP and this end represent that there are more than one variable you are passing in this get request and then we have our second variable St age is equal to 19 and then we have third variable which is s weight is equal to 46 so this is the request get request you are passing to your PHP page and then this request comes to your PHP page and this is printed according like this right but for example you don't even pass anything here I will just for example I will just leave it as blank what happens it just print blank blank uh names and age and weight right for example if you don't want to uh you know uh want user to uh do something like this what you get can do here is you can use another is uh another Glo Global variable in if condition so I will just give if and this is a pre defined variable which is called is set and it just check that if the value of the variable is set or not so we want to check if the value of get student name is set or not so I will just write it like this and I also want that so I will give this ands symbol here I have shown you how to use this m and and these logical and comparison operators in uh the early earlier videos right so and then I also want to check whether my age field is has some value or not and in the same way I want to check my weight field has some value or not and if they have some value I want to print it otherwise else I will just say that I will just Echo please enter all field please enter all Fields okay so now when I submit this form as blank I will just submit it and it says you can use null not equal to let's see what's the problem here is set okay so I know the problem we need to this use this is at function for every get method so I will use with this is Set uh with this get method and is set with this get method okay now once again let's try and I will just reload my page and submit this and now I can get this uh name because I also need to check whether these names are empty or not so what I can do here is I can declare name variable is equal to get student name in a similar way I can declare age and weight it takes student age and student weight and I will check one more thing if and there is one more function inbuild function in PHP which is empty function so it checks whether your variable is empty or not so I will just say so if not empty you see I have given this not symbol here right so if this name variable is not empty then and once again I will just copy this two times more and for age and the weight and if name is not empty age is not empty and weight is not empty then I want to print this okay I'll just inclose this form uh or this if if condition and once again when I try try to run this hopefully it will run once again reload pass it uh says some error yeah because this get is missing this and and symbol right and symbol and symbol save it once again go back and hopefully this time it will work so we see nothing here right because we have submitted nothing as a here right but we we are not able to see this this uh please enter all Fields because I think this else should move after this so This else condition should be else condition for this if condition other than rather than this okay and once again and qu and it says please enter all the values right but whenever we provide some value for example name age and weight and it prints the values okay so when no values are printed or when no value is submitted by Form it says please enter all the values and when we enter of when we submit some values and pass the query it prints the it prints the name age and weight and you can also see the modification in the URL which is uh done by PHP so in this way you can use get variable in your PHP script I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
