00:09 - that is we are going to install
00:10 - basically ubu and we will see the basic
00:13 - comp concept of virtual box what is
00:15 - virtual box and why we will use it okay
00:18 - so let's start with the first virtual
00:19 - box so virtual box is nothing but one
00:21 - kind of software uh that we use to run
00:24 - different operating system in our main
00:25 - host okay so our main host here means
00:28 - that our one this operating system that
00:31 - that this one which I'm using right now
00:32 - that is Windows 11 okay so in this
00:34 - operating system we are going to use
00:37 - another operating system with the help
00:38 - of virtual box okay I hope that is clear
00:40 - to you like what is a virtual box okay
00:44 - so basically we will uh install obuntu
00:47 - OS but before that you will need to
00:49 - first of all install virtual box so how
00:51 - you can do it you have to just go on
00:53 - this particular website watchbox
00:56 - dog and you have to click on this
00:58 - download watchbox 6.1 and and then
01:00 - according to your host you can download
01:02 - it if I hope it's
01:04 - windows so you can just click on Windows
01:06 - host okay this will download the uh

24:27 - successful in install the Linux
24:28 - operating system or you can s to OS in
24:30 - your PC using virtual box so that's all
24:33 - for today so do like share and subscribe
24:36 - programming knowledge and uh I'll meet
24:38 - you in the next video thank you thank
24:40 - you for watching so now here is our uh
24:42 - Linux system uh which we had already
24:44 - installed yesterday if you have not
24:47 - watched the previous video then please
24:48 - go and watch that video because without
24:50 - this uh you will not be able to follow
24:52 - us okay uh if you have already installed
24:55 - then it's fine if you have not installed
24:57 - then you can go for it okay so now what
25:00 - we have to do we have to first off all
25:02 - learn the one of the basic command like
25:05 - LS command but before that you should
25:07 - have some familiarity with this uh uh
25:10 - like envirment Linux envirment like here
25:12 - you can see the browser web browser mail
25:16 - here you can see the files that just
25:18 - like in our Windows system there is the
25:21 - this one file explorer similarly here is
25:23 - also that thing okay you can access the
25:26 - different folders documents uh and then
25:30 - downloads music whatever thing you will
25:32 - download from web browser it will get
25:34 - downloaded in this particular video uh
25:36 - in this particular sorry uh download for
25:39 - directory and here is some public uh
25:43 - folder and there is nothing okay and
25:47 - also you will get the trash videos
25:50 - pictures all these things okay so these
25:53 - are the all things which you will
25:56 - get so now what we have have to do we
25:58 - you you will need to first of all open
26:00 - up the terminal uh you can go from uh
26:04 - here and then you can click on Terminal
26:07 - okay but uh also there is a shortcut for
26:10 - opening the terminal is the control alt
26:12 - T okay so now I will cut this and you
26:16 - can just hit control alt and then D so
26:20 - it will like open one of the terminal so
26:23 - this is our terminal and on this
26:25 - particular thing we will work so let me
26:28 - maximize
26:30 - it I hope it is visible to
26:35 - you okay just wait a
26:40 - minute
26:42 - uh you know it should be visible to you
26:45 - guys okay so uh the First Command which
26:48 - we will uh learn about in this video is
26:50 - the ls command so what is LS command
26:53 - first we will talk about this what is LS
26:55 - command uh just think about LS s is
26:58 - nothing but the list the content so we
27:00 - use the ls command to list the contents
27:03 - of a particular directory okay if you
27:06 - are suppose you are in desktop directory
27:09 - so you want to get all the what are the
27:12 - files what are the director in that
27:13 - particular desktop if you want to get it
27:16 - so you will use a simple command that is
27:18 - called as LS command
27:19 - okay so what we will do we'll just hit
27:22 - LS okay so now I'm in the home folder
27:26 - and where you can the desktop documents
27:29 - downloads music pictures and all these
27:31 - things okay so what I will do for the
27:33 - purpose of uh showing
27:36 - you I will just open up the files in my
27:41 - here on my screen I will try to minimize
27:46 - it okay yeah here you can see I'm
27:51 - already on the home directory okay from
27:54 - here you can see
27:56 - also uh I hope it's
27:59 - visible let me minimize the size of this
28:01 - particular
28:04 - window
28:06 - yeah now here you can see uh this is the
28:09 - home and the same content which uh we
28:11 - are getting also here okay so this is
28:14 - the uh main purpose of the command LS so
28:19 - this is the basic uh work which it does
28:21 - like it just list the content of that
28:24 - particular um folder or particular
28:27 - directory in which you are present so if
28:29 - I will go in the desktop and here you
28:32 - can see one file has been created
28:33 - desktop so now what we will
28:36 - do we will just uh here click on open it
28:40 - terminal okay and then now you can see
28:45 - where are you you are in the desktop now
28:47 - here when you will do
28:49 - LS so here also you can see you are
28:52 - getting that particular directory test
28:54 - as it is okay so I hope you got the idea
28:57 - about how the ls Works what are the main
28:59 - person purpose behind this okay so now
29:04 - what we will I will talk about with you
29:06 - is the flags or you can see say the
29:10 - options or arguments so there are many
29:14 - options or arguments which we use with
29:16 - the ls command
29:18 - okay so I will use uh uh so you the
29:22 - first one is L hyphen L that is small l
29:26 - so this is the basically the format or
29:28 - you can say the Syntax for the like
29:30 - commands like there will be command name
29:32 - then hyph then the whatever the option
29:34 - which you want to provide with it so
29:36 - what this command will basically do
29:38 - hyphen L just stands for the long format
29:41 - okay it will show you the all the files
29:43 - and act in the long format so I will
29:46 - just hit enter and now you will Le think
29:49 - like wow what what is this now you will
29:53 - get a bit of confused about it okay so
29:56 - let me tell you about these things like
29:58 - um these are these are the some
30:00 - permissions
30:02 - okay uh like read write execute uh there
30:06 - will be a separate video on this
30:07 - permission because this is a very
30:08 - important topic okay and then there is a
30:12 - users user name group name this is the
30:14 - file size and the dates and all and the
30:17 - last modification date uh time so the uh
30:22 - I had created The One desktop folder at
30:24 - 153 a.m. so that's why it is showing at
30:28 - uh this time 153 okay so now what I will
30:31 - do uh I will create one folder in
30:35 - documents
30:37 - okay and here I will do new folder and
30:41 - here I will give it the name as uh
30:45 - LS command okay here you can see the
30:50 - documents folder and in that we have a
30:52 - LS command now what I will do I will
30:56 - just again hit the ls
30:59 - iel here now you can see the last
31:02 - modification time of that particular uh
31:05 - directory document is 217 and here also
31:08 - you can say it's now 218 now okay I hope
31:11 - you got the idea about this hyphen L
31:14 - format like it basically displays you
31:16 - the result in the long format okay so
31:21 - this is the main purpose of this L
31:23 - hyphen L flag now uh let me talk you uh
31:28 - about some other flags like H flag okay
31:31 - so H flag basically uh does the like it
31:35 - will show you the format in the human
31:37 - rable format okay like as you can see
31:40 - this is a 4096 you will not get what is
31:42 - this basically it is the file size okay
31:45 - and uh if I will do hyphen Ed then you
31:48 - will get some difference uh let me
31:50 - create one more terminal so that you can
31:53 - differentiate between both the result
31:56 - okay
31:59 - minimize it
32:01 - uh my batter is
32:08 - low okay now what I will do here LS
32:11 - hyphen L hyph HED okay we can use the
32:16 - separate uh as a separate flag or we can
32:19 - just combine both together I will show
32:21 - you after this okay don't worry about it
32:24 - so here now you can see this is showing
32:26 - me the human form what is 36 it is 36 KB
32:30 - and then 4 KB 4 KB 4 KB this is the size
32:33 - of all like directories and there is
32:37 - some uh basic concept about it I will
32:39 - tell you later in that particular video
32:41 - when we will come across with the more
32:43 - description about these things like it
32:45 - is basically related to the hard link
32:47 - soft soft link kind of concept in Linux
32:49 - okay so as this is a beginner purpose
32:52 - video so we'll not cover this at this
32:54 - time otherwise you will get confused
32:56 - okay
32:57 - so uh we I had used LS hyph l hyph h
33:01 - okay so now what I will do I'll just
33:03 - combine both things okay hyphen
33:07 - LH as you can see there will be no
33:09 - difference and it will also not uh no
33:12 - like it will also not provide me like
33:13 - this command is basically like unvalid
33:16 - or anything else so you can see we can
33:19 - write like this also or we can write
33:21 - like this also so now uh one more
33:25 - command you will need now the clear
33:28 - command what this command will do I hope
33:30 - you guessed it right this will just
33:32 - clear all the this screen okay I will
33:35 - just hit enter and yeah boom you got
33:38 - clear okay now uh let move about some
33:43 - other flags which we will use the simple
33:45 - flag is also the a flag what it does you
33:49 - will
33:51 - uh understand like it will list all the
33:53 - files and directory okay uh the hidden
33:56 - file files also it will show us and here
33:59 - you can see we are getting the this bash
34:01 - history log out bash RC file all these
34:04 - files which we we are getting here okay
34:07 - now let me show you here also so you
34:09 - will get idea about it how it's working
34:12 - you can go
34:14 - here and it should be somewhere like
34:17 - hidden
34:19 - files uh yeah here you can see the so
34:22 - hidden files is unchecked now we will
34:24 - check it and then yeah boom
34:27 - you can see the same result as we have
34:31 - BC and here is also the BC file and
34:36 - other some files which are present here
34:38 - also okay so for now I am again
34:42 - unchecking it so it should be simple
34:47 - okay so now uh we can combine the hyl
34:50 - option with this also like
34:52 - Al we are getting the same thing but
34:56 - what in the long format okay like this
34:58 - is the same permissions numbers some
35:01 - kind of and the i i this is the username
35:05 - and group and root root is the root user
35:08 - who like we will get about this what is
35:11 - root and all these things when you when
35:13 - we will learn about the user creation
35:15 - things in Linux
35:17 - okay so uh I hope you got it the hyphen
35:21 - L option also
35:24 - okay uh let me tell you one more
35:27 - uh flag which are important here like uh
35:32 - hyphen LD okay uh what we will do in
35:36 - this when we will uh combine the L with
35:40 - d directory d stands for directory and
35:42 - want to get the details of the Let's uh
35:45 - get documents
35:47 - directory uh
35:49 - yeah now here we can see you you are
35:52 - getting the details of a specific
35:54 - directory that is documents okay and
35:57 - here is the same thing that we were
35:59 - getting earlier like uh you can match it
36:02 - with it like documents and here also you
36:05 - can see the permissions users group size
36:09 - and the last modification time okay this
36:12 - is the LD so these are the some basic uh
36:16 - uh Flags which you can use with the ls
36:20 - command okay and uh that's all for today
36:24 - also if you want more uh like U practice
36:28 - on it you can go here also on uh try
36:32 - Haack
36:33 - me.com like this is a platform on which
36:36 - there is a Linux
36:40 - uh uh tutorials or something you can
36:43 - say
36:46 - uh uh wait a
36:50 - minute yeah I think I got it
36:55 - here m
36:58 - in the
37:00 - loar it should be in the learning path
37:03 - or somewhere
37:07 - else yeah Linux
37:10 - fundamentals okay if you want um more
37:13 - in-depth knowledge or you want to
37:15 - practice some your skills then you can
37:17 - go on this platform also okay so
37:23 - uh that's all for today and I hope you
37:26 - you understood about the ls command if
37:29 - you they see Linux is just like about
37:31 - your practice if you do more practice
37:32 - you will get more familiar with it like
37:35 - uh uh like when I had started it was
37:37 - like what is this thing and what is this
37:40 - terminal I was get scared of this but
37:42 - when you start practicing with it when
37:45 - you play with this uh then you will get
37:47 - a idea about yes uh you can understand
37:49 - it okay so that's all for today and uh
37:53 - please like share and subscribe our
37:55 - Channel and hit a like button if you
37:57 - like this okay so thank you for watching
37:59 - and we will meet you in the next video
38:01 - thank you thank you so
38:04 - much so now today in this video what we
38:07 - are going to learn so basically we're
38:08 - going to learn about one of the more
38:10 - basic command that is CD command which
38:12 - means the change directory Okay C stands
38:15 - for change directory command so what we
38:17 - will do today uh we will learn about how
38:20 - we can change our directory from one to
38:22 - another okay now what I have to do I
38:24 - have to just increase the phont size for
38:26 - you guys are it should be
38:28 - visible uh I think yeah it's okay it's
38:31 - visible it should
38:33 - be and in the next video in window what
38:36 - I will do I will just open this file
38:39 - manager for your reference to show you
38:42 - how the things are working
38:47 - okay now this is our home directory here
38:50 - you can see
38:53 - home okay and right now we are also in
38:55 - the terminal we are on the home
38:57 - directory what we will do we will do
38:59 - this just LS okay so here you can see we
39:03 - are getting different files like
39:05 - different directory directress desktop
39:08 - downloads pictures snap videos documents
39:11 - and so on okay so now today in this
39:14 - video what we are going to learn about
39:15 - the CD command Okay CD what it basically
39:19 - means CD just stand for change directory
39:23 - what it will do it will just change your
39:25 - directory okay now our current direct is
39:27 - what it is our home okay we are at home
39:29 - we want to go on the
39:31 - desktop okay how we will do it so there
39:35 - are the two ways in which we can perform
39:37 - this action like first one is that we
39:39 - that is basically a concept of Linux so
39:42 - that's why I'm telling you uh that is of
39:44 - I think one of these is absolute path
39:46 - name and the second is relative path
39:48 - names okay so first we will talk about
39:51 - the absolute path name in absolute path
39:53 - names what we do we just provide the
39:55 - whole path
39:59 - okay uh wait a minute I'll just provide
40:03 - the desktop path okay I want to go move
40:07 - to into the desktop directory what I
40:09 - will do CD desktop this is basically
40:11 - what absolute path names okay so I will
40:14 - just hit enter and now you can see I'm
40:16 - in the desktop now what I will do I will
40:19 - do
40:20 - LS okay so here you can see the file
40:25 - which uh uh this is also One Directory
40:27 - uh in which we had created in the last
40:30 - video okay so this is the files of the
40:35 - desktop directory okay so this is the
40:39 - like uh one of the way in which we can
40:41 - do it like we call it as the absolute
40:44 - path names and now the next is relative
40:46 - path now what is this so basically
40:48 - relative path names works for a
40:50 - particular notation that is dot then or
40:53 - you can say double dot okay so what I I
40:56 - have to do now I have to go back now I'm
40:59 - in the desktop I have to go back okay
41:02 - like uh
41:04 - from let me cancel it like from here you
41:07 - can see I'm in the t uh right now we are
41:10 - here at the test okay in the desktop
41:13 - directory now what I have to go I have
41:15 - to go back in the where in the home
41:17 - directory so for this what I will do I
41:19 - will just do CD dot
41:22 - dot again back we are back okay we in
41:26 - this particular window or uh we this in
41:30 - this particular window you can say like
41:32 - in the home directory now there is also
41:34 - one more command uh which we learn in
41:37 - this video like that is
41:40 - PWD what it does it just shows you the
41:43 - present working directory so our present
41:45 - working directory is home/ why a because
41:48 - you a is one of the user of this
41:49 - particular OS that's why it's showing I
41:52 - like whenever you will create multiple
41:54 - users then you will get your own
41:55 - particular home directory in which you
41:57 - will create your separate files and
41:58 - folders or anything which you want to
42:00 - create okay that's why it's saying home
42:02 - I now what I will do I will move into
42:04 - the documents
42:07 - directory okay documents okay now now
42:12 - I'm here documents so now what I will do
42:15 - I will just do
42:16 - PWD so here you can see we are getting
42:19 - again the same present working that CD
42:22 - like home I use documents okay I hope
42:24 - you got the idea what how AWD is working
42:27 - how documents is working now what I have
42:29 - to do I have to just go back one more
42:31 - directory
42:33 - back one by dot dot okay we are back now
42:38 - I I will do PW again we are at the home
42:40 - and aush we add the home directory now
42:44 - we will just hit uh clear button and
42:47 - here what we will do we will create a
42:49 - one structure here you can see LS
42:51 - command is one of the
42:52 - folder and
42:55 - uh I will open up this folder and I will
42:58 - try to
42:59 - create again new folder that is test
43:05 - two okay now what we will do we have to
43:09 - come directly in the ls command folder
43:12 - so how we can do it first we first of
43:13 - all we will do LS okay we got the list
43:17 - of the all directory which are present
43:18 - in the home directory now where I have
43:20 - to go I have to go in the documents
43:22 - directory so I will do
43:25 - CD documents I'm just uh entering uh
43:28 - like after typing the DU and then if you
43:32 - will hit tab then automatically it will
43:33 - like app like this documents okay then
43:36 - after documents where we have to
43:38 - go like now I'm in documents now I will
43:41 - do LS we are on the this documents for
43:45 - directory and here is the directory that
43:46 - is LS command now what I have to do LS
43:49 - command okay now where we are we are in
43:53 - the document / LS command now what I
43:54 - will do I will do LS
43:57 - this is we are in the test two uh not in
44:01 - the test two like this is the content uh
44:04 - of this particular directory like LS
44:05 - command now I I will do I will again go
44:08 - back and go into the test
44:11 - two okay oh let me increase it width so
44:15 - it should be clear to you okay now what
44:18 - I will do I will just hit PWD PWD means
44:21 - present working di so my present working
44:23 - D is home I use documents LS command and
44:26 - the test two okay now what we will do we
44:29 - will go back one by one CD dot
44:33 - dot We Are One Directory back CD dot dot
44:38 - Again One Directory back CD dot dot
44:41 - Again One Directory back now we are
44:43 - where we are we are in the home
44:46 - directory now what I will do I will just
44:49 - uh give the whole path okay documents
44:54 - slash LS command
44:56 - slash test in this way you can also go
44:59 - in the like your final destination
45:01 - direct like providing the whole path in
45:03 - a single string okay now what I will do
45:06 - PWD so you can see the whole path like
45:11 - this is same as this this one like when
45:14 - we uh move went to that directly like
45:17 - one by one okay when we were doing one
45:18 - by one then we were all getting these
45:21 - results and also when we are doing like
45:23 - in a single string then also we are
45:24 - getting the same result I hope you got
45:26 - the idea about how this CD change direct
45:28 - working
45:31 - okay let me clear this now uh there is
45:34 - also one more shortcut to go directly in
45:36 - the home directory that is
45:38 - CD this till it will directly go into
45:41 - the home directory that is LS okay or we
45:45 - when we will do PWD you will get that
45:48 - particular window okay so I hope you got
45:52 - this uh how the things are working and
45:54 - this is all about the C CD like change
45:56 - directory command Okay CD stands for
45:59 - change
46:01 - directory okay I hope it is clear now so
46:04 - we will meet in the next video with uh
46:06 - like we will create some folders and
46:08 - files and all these things we will talk
46:10 - about in the next video so that's all
46:12 - for today's video and thank you for
46:13 - watching so we'll meet in next one okay
46:16 - thank you thank you for
46:17 - watching so mkdr command is nothing but
46:20 - uh like it just stands for the make
46:22 - directory okay what by directory means
46:25 - like in Linux we basically uh call
46:28 - directory but in the other uh operating
46:30 - system like Windows what we call it as a
46:32 - folder so directory is something
46:34 - basically like a folder you can uh like
46:37 - you can say like that okay direct is
46:38 - like a folder so now what I was talking
46:41 - about uh to create a directory so what
46:43 - we will do uh we will uh take uh like a
46:49 - uh structure to create a directory okay
46:51 - so let me draw uh structure for
46:54 - you
46:59 - this is a website where you can easily
47:02 - like uh draw any kind of structure or
47:05 - whatever you want
47:07 - okay I want to create a blank diagram
47:11 - create okay save it anywhere I don't
47:16 - care save oh sorry
47:24 - test okay here it is now what we will do
47:29 - uh we will create first
47:32 - uh
47:35 - University
47:36 - okay then
47:39 - uh in that
47:42 - University we will
47:45 - create
47:49 - students
47:51 - okay and uh then we
47:54 - will
47:58 - create facalities
48:02 - and then we will
48:07 - create uh you can call it as a workers
48:12 - okay and in the student section we will
48:15 - create
48:18 - uh like uh we will name it uh one of the
48:21 - student like aush okay or uh something
48:26 - like XY Z okay and similarly in the
48:30 - faculties uh you want to give it as some
48:32 - kind of uh instead of faculties here I
48:35 - will try to give it a subject okay now
48:39 - here we will write
48:41 - Linux networking okay and we will leave
48:45 - the workers as a blank okay so we will
48:47 - follow this pattern to create directives
48:49 - so this will be helpful too like when
48:51 - you will play with it you will get a
48:52 - better idea like and also you will get a
48:54 - practice about about the CD command that
48:56 - we have learned earlier in the last
48:58 - video okay so uh how will we proceed I
49:04 - will try to just uh off the
49:08 - screen I hope it should be visible to
49:12 - you okay yeah now it is
49:15 - visible and now what we will do we will
49:18 - clear the screen and we will do just LS
49:21 - okay so here what we have we have just
49:23 - desktop downloads pictures snap and
49:26 - these things okay and I will try to hit
49:28 - just PW PWD we are in where we are in
49:31 - the home directory now what I will do I
49:34 - will create a first University directory
49:37 - okay so I will create M KD i r and then
49:41 - I will write
49:43 - University
49:45 - okay I have created University let's say
49:48 - tells okay so here you can see uh we
49:51 - have got the university directory now
49:54 - what I have to do in the University I
49:56 - have to create this students directory
49:58 - subject and workers okay first what we
50:01 - will do we will create these directories
50:03 - one by one then after the after the
50:06 - whole this completion of the whole
50:08 - diagram sorry what we will
50:11 - do we will create these three directory
50:14 - like in a row okay in a single command
50:16 - we will do it okay so let's do it first
50:19 - single uh single okay so I will first go
50:22 - into the university directory CD
50:26 - and then we will do LS that is nothing
50:28 - what I will do I will create a student
50:30 - directory
50:32 - students okay then I will create uh when
50:36 - you get upper key then you will get the
50:38 - previous command okay then I will create
50:42 - subject then I will create workers okay
50:47 - so now I will do LS so here you can see
50:50 - we have got the three directories now
50:52 - what I have to do I have to create a uh
50:54 - more directories in
50:57 - uh students so here is one thing also I
50:59 - want to tell you about like here
51:00 - students in this students uh you will
51:03 - see the S is capital but when I will try
51:06 - to hit s with a
51:08 - small then what happen no such file
51:10 - direct why because this is a case
51:12 - sensitive in Linux it follows case
51:13 - sensitivity okay that's why it happens
51:16 - now what I will do c capital S then
51:19 - tap now t Okay students now where we are
51:23 - we are in the students directory when I
51:25 - will do PWD what we will get we'll get
51:29 - the exact location where we are okay so
51:32 - now what we have to do first of all I
51:34 - want to clear this whole thing okay now
51:36 - what I will do I will create two
51:38 - directors with
51:41 - name aush and with
51:45 - name
51:48 - uh
51:49 - angit okay LS AIT has been created okay
51:55 - now now what I will do I have to go back
51:57 - in the subject directory so how we can
52:00 - do it we will do just CD dot dot
52:03 - remember in the last video we talked
52:05 - about this CD dot dot and here now where
52:09 - I am I am in the University when I do LS
52:12 - I will have the access of subject and
52:13 - workers also what I will do now I will
52:16 - just do
52:17 - CD
52:19 - subject okay and then again bw2 we we
52:22 - are in the subject directory now what I
52:23 - have to do I have to create
52:26 - two directors
52:28 - Linux and
52:31 - then
52:32 - networking okay now I'll do LS here you
52:35 - can see Linux and networking has been
52:37 - created and in the workers directory we
52:39 - don't have to write anything or we don't
52:41 - have to create any kind of folder in it
52:43 - okay so this is the basically like
52:45 - simple process of creating files and
52:47 - directories in the Linux and now I will
52:49 - tell you some like
52:52 - uh um means I will do like uh creating
52:56 - these whole things in a single command
52:57 - okay not whole things but yeah this one
53:00 - and this one I will try to create
53:02 - okay so what I will do uh I will go in
53:06 - the home directory
53:08 - again clear now and I will show you here
53:12 - also like how in the file system it will
53:16 - look like whether it is there or not
53:18 - okay uh yeah here you can see University
53:22 - director is here in the University we
53:23 - have student subject workers and in the
53:25 - students we have aush and anit and back
53:29 - and in the subject we have Linux and
53:31 - networking and now what I will do I will
53:33 - just delete this directory
53:36 - okay
53:38 - uh from here I can delete okay to delete
53:41 - the directories and all I will tell you
53:43 - this in the next video okay otherwise
53:46 - everything will get mixed up okay so now
53:49 - if I will do LS here so there is no
53:52 - University folder is there now what I
53:53 - will do I will just create a university
53:56 - folder uh sorry
53:58 - University okay now university has been
54:01 - created I will move into this directory
54:04 - and now I have to do you know I have to
54:06 - create a student subject workers so what
54:08 - I can do
54:10 - mkd
54:11 - students
54:13 - okay
54:15 - space
54:16 - subject I think spelling mistake is
54:19 - there some okay yeah subject and then I
54:22 - will create
54:23 - workers boom
54:25 - no let's hit LS then you will get
54:28 - something yeah so here what we are doing
54:30 - in the same in the single command we are
54:33 - creating three directories or you can
54:35 - create multiple directory uh it all
54:37 - depends on you how much you want to
54:38 - create okay and now what I have to do in
54:41 - the students we have to create aush and
54:44 - XY Z so how I will do
54:48 - mkd in the
54:52 - students sorry sorry uh
54:56 - okay sorry for it uh I by mistake uh
55:01 - entered this enter
55:04 - okay this is LS okay now what I have to
55:07 - do I will go in the students directory
55:12 - students okay now what I will do I will
55:15 - create again the both aush and angit
55:19 - like before I okay LS same okay so this
55:24 - is
55:25 - like one way to create multiple
55:26 - directories at in a single command okay
55:29 - so I hope you got it how you can create
55:31 - multiple directories okay I'm not going
55:33 - to show you for the subject like it will
55:35 - be then you will get bored like I'm like
55:37 - displaying you same things again and
55:39 - again okay so now let me tell you
55:41 - something more interesting things okay I
55:43 - will clear and then go back into the
55:46 - home directory clear everything LS and
55:50 - now what I will do
55:51 - now I want to tell you some more
55:53 - Concepts like uh uh the options which we
55:56 - can use with the uh hyphen P command
55:59 - Okay so the first option which I want to
56:01 - show you like hyphen V that stands for
56:04 - veros so when we will do this mkd hyphen
56:08 - V it will tell you the uh like uh
56:10 - whether directory has been created or
56:12 - not okay so let's me let me create uh
56:15 - like
56:17 - um uh what anything Linux okay here you
56:23 - can see created directory Linux again uh
56:27 - let me tell you again I want to create
56:29 - same directory let's see what happens
56:31 - here you can see cannot create directly
56:34 - Linux file exist what if I remove hyphen
56:37 - B whether it stays displaying or not the
56:40 - same error okay it displays the same
56:43 - error okay so but when we use hyphen V
56:45 - it will tell you the status like whether
56:46 - direct is created or not
56:49 - okay I hope it's clear hyphen V and in
56:52 - the next we will talk about hyphen P op
56:54 - so what it does hyphen p uh like when we
56:58 - suppose we want to create a directory in
57:01 - which like University in the University
57:04 - students and then in the student we want
57:06 - aush okay aush we want only okay so how
57:11 - we can do it uh but before uh that I
57:14 - will need to sorry I will not delete
57:16 - that okay uh let it be I will get some
57:19 - more uh extra scenario like uh
57:23 - uh
57:26 - let's create uh some kind of uh like
57:31 - uh
57:33 - um
57:35 - sun and with sun let's create
57:41 - a ha
57:48 - father and then we will create obviously
57:52 - grandfather okay or we can Go reverse
57:55 - also I think I have created in the re
57:59 - reverse Mo should be in the last okay
58:03 - grandfather okay now what I will do mkd
58:06 - i r hyphen P option and Son slash
58:13 - father slash
58:17 - grandfather okay so basically this
58:19 - command what it will it will create the
58:21 - like in the sun directory you will get
58:23 - father in the father directory Direct
58:24 - you will get the grandfather but uh if
58:27 - you will not use hyphen P option then
58:30 - what will happen like we will not be
58:32 - able to create a directory like if son
58:34 - father does not exist then it will not
58:37 - create grandfather okay but if uh like
58:41 - if it exist son father exist okay sorry
58:46 - I got a little bit confused here let me
58:50 - first of all create this one okay LS a
58:54 - should should be sun directory son
58:58 - LS
59:00 - father LS okay so what I was trying to
59:03 - say like when we will use hypen P option
59:06 - if sonf father is not created then it
59:09 - will be get created automatically but
59:12 - when we will not use hyper Fe then it
59:14 - will not get created like uh let me go
59:17 - back and now what I will do I will try
59:20 - to create mkdr test
59:22 - one/ test 2/ test
59:25 - uh three it should be like in test one
59:28 - there should be test two in test two
59:29 - there should be test three here you can
59:31 - see cannot create directory okay no such
59:34 - file directory is there okay so I hope
59:36 - you got the like actual role of the
59:38 - hyphen P option
59:40 - okay and this is not a more uh big deal
59:43 - if you want to if you play more and more
59:46 - with this command you will get familiar
59:48 - with the this whole Linux environment
59:50 - okay that's not a big deal now the next
59:52 - thing is hyphen M option okay okay what
59:55 - it does this is nothing but mode okay
59:57 - mode or we can say permissions like uh
60:01 - uh till now we have not cover the
60:02 - permission section in Linux like it is
60:05 - another concept and another another
60:07 - video will come up on this concept like
60:10 - read write execute all these things but
60:12 - still I tell you like if the if the
60:15 - person will have the read read
60:17 - permission then that user can read the
60:19 - file if he has write then he can write
60:21 - the file or execute then he can execute
60:24 - that file but if he has all the three
60:26 - then he can do anything reite execute
60:28 - all okay so how we can do this mkdr
60:31 - hyphen M and we provide a equal to
60:34 - suppose we want to provide R WX all to
60:38 - the one directory that is
60:40 - test I hope test is not there yes test
60:45 - is created now what I have to do lsph L
60:48 - you can see he has the permission of all
60:50 - these
60:51 - things and here you can see where is
60:54 - test so rwx rwx rwx did that execute
60:59 - there is something like rwx for users
61:01 - and another this RW is for group and
61:04 - another this rwx is for other persons
61:07 - okay so when we will do test in this
61:11 - when we will go in this directory we can
61:12 - do any kind of operation mkd uh sorry
61:15 - mkd test blah blah blah okay we can do
61:18 - anything but now what I will do I will
61:21 - try to create uh One Directory with only
61:24 - operations okay so let's see what
61:27 - happens whether we are able to create or
61:30 - not anything in that particular d
61:32 - whether we have a permission or not so
61:34 - what I will do mkd hyphen m a equal to I
61:39 - want to give just read operation we can
61:41 - only read read and I will create
61:45 - test
61:48 - three let's dos hyph L and now you can
61:52 - see in test three we have on read
61:54 - permission to everyone users also groups
61:59 - also and others I think others have not
62:03 - any permission okay here okay now I will
62:07 - go in the test
62:09 - three test three you can see permission
62:13 - denied we don't have access to that
62:16 - folder so now who can access this folder
62:19 - there is also one user in the Linux bu
62:22 - root only root can access
62:26 - okay uh so that's all about this in this
62:29 - video like uh mkdr command so I hope you
62:32 - liked it and uh please like share
62:35 - subscribe uh our YouTube channel and now
62:38 - we will meet in the next video with
62:39 - another uh basic command like in the
62:41 - next video we will basically talk about
62:43 - the whole directory which we have
62:44 - created we will then again we will
62:46 - create some directory then we will
62:47 - delete it whether the direct is empty
62:49 - then what what we can do if it is not
62:51 - empty then how we can delete it so these
62:53 - are all the things which we will cover
62:55 - in the next video so that's all for
62:56 - today and we will meet in the next one
62:57 - thank you thank you so much for
63:02 - watching so now what I will do I will
63:05 - create uh one more directory I will
63:08 - start by creating a directory
63:12 - mkd
63:13 - aush
63:15 - okay I have created aush and now what I
63:19 - have to
63:21 - do uh I have to again create uh more
63:24 - Dory in aush CD aush okay mkd iush 2
63:30 - okay iush 2 now we are done again I will
63:34 - go on the home
63:36 - directory and what I will do I will
63:39 - create one more directory
63:41 - mkd
63:43 - um test
63:46 - 67 okay so here you can see aush has
63:49 - been created already in the aush
63:51 - directory we have another iush 2 and
63:53 - text 67 where it is oh yeah here this is
63:57 - one okay so I will perform here LS and
64:00 - now you can see all the directory which
64:01 - we have created now what I have to tell
64:04 - you like to remove this directory uh the
64:07 - command is rmd I okay remove directory
64:11 - so there is a one thing in this like uh
64:16 - uh let me clear this all uh if
64:20 - directory is empty okay if like uh
64:25 - suppose this direct t 67 there is
64:28 - nothing this is empty directory so in
64:30 - this case we can easily use
64:33 - rmd okay we can easily use it but if
64:36 - directory is not empty suppose in this
64:40 - case I I to so in this case when we will
64:43 - do rmd so what will happen like it will
64:46 - uh like it will not delete that
64:48 - particular directory it will show you
64:50 - the error like uh directory is not empty
64:53 - okay but when you will go in the iuse
64:56 - directory and when you'll try to delete
64:58 - IUS 2 then it can be easily deleted why
65:00 - the reason behind is this like iuse to
65:03 - is
65:04 - empty okay I hope you got this point
65:07 - like uh how rmd command works so uh now
65:13 - our job is to just delete the directory
65:14 - and learn the things okay so let's start
65:18 - so what we will do uh LS now I will
65:22 - first try to delete the test
65:25 - 67 test 67 okay so now what will happen
65:30 - I will hit just enter and now boom so
65:33 - your test 67 has been deleted okay now
65:37 - again we will try to do LS here and so
65:39 - you will not see anywhere like T 67 is
65:41 - there now now what we will do and yeah
65:44 - one more S I want to tell you that uh
65:46 - for clearing the terminal if you do
65:48 - clear then it will clear obviously but
65:51 - there is also one more shortcut like
65:52 - Control Plus L automatically will get
65:56 - clear okay so now what we have to do we
65:59 - have to remove the directory
66:02 - iush okay now let's see what
66:05 - happens fail to remove iush directory
66:08 - not empty okay obviously D is not empty
66:11 - we know like there is another folder in
66:14 - aush so what we will do now we will go
66:16 - in aush directory and then I will try to
66:19 - first delete I
66:21 - 2 okay we have deleted and there is no
66:25 - any directory now what I will do I will
66:28 - go back in the home directory and I will
66:30 - delete
66:31 - iush okay so iuse has been deleted okay
66:35 - so suppose if there is many folders and
66:38 - directories like Suppose there in iuse
66:40 - there is I 2 to I 100 okay or in that
66:43 - particular directory there are other
66:45 - more directories okay so you have to
66:47 - delete this so this is very tedious work
66:50 - like uh like it's not easy to do one by
66:53 - one okay so so like the solution for
66:56 - that is that like we will use some flax
66:59 - with it okay so now again let me create
67:02 - a directly I will use hyphen P option if
67:03 - you watched previous video then you will
67:05 - get it what is hyphen p and all these
67:07 - things so I'm going to create a not test
67:10 - let's create with I
67:12 - one I
67:14 - 2 I 3 uh so what what will happen here
67:19 - like in I one there will be I2 in I two
67:21 - there will be I three so you can check
67:23 - here
67:25 - uh is one I2 and I3 and in I2 there will
67:29 - be nothing it will be empty directory so
67:32 - now what I have to do I have to delete
67:34 - this whole directory in single command
67:38 - so what I will do there are multiple
67:40 - ways I will tell you everything each one
67:42 - by one the more uh different ways okay
67:44 - so we will use
67:47 - rmd slash S okay and then we will just
67:52 - provide the directory name
67:54 - I one okay so uh what this command will
67:58 - do basically it will delete the whole
68:00 - the directory from the root to the end
68:03 - like child like it will start from I and
68:06 - it will end to the I 3 and it will
68:08 - delete the whole file structure and with
68:11 - this command it will ask you for the
68:13 - permission like you you will need to
68:16 - enter yes or no whether you want to
68:17 - delete or not like just like a
68:19 - confirmation message it will ask for you
68:21 - let's check what happens
68:24 - okay uh it's
68:26 - showing no such fileo
68:28 - directory
68:30 - why uh one minute let me check with this
68:34 - hyph help whether it works in ubu or not
68:39 - okay sorry we can use hyphen P option
68:41 - for that okay
68:43 - sorry what we'll do rmd hyphen
68:47 - p i
68:49 - one I think we will need to provide
68:51 - whole path okay I three so we can easy
68:55 - have we have deleted easily in this way
68:57 - also we can use
68:59 - rmd in this way okay but there is also
69:02 - one way that SL say I will need to just
69:05 - check with the Google uh why this
69:08 - command didn't
69:10 - work
69:15 - uh not working with the
69:18 - one2 like I have used this command
69:20 - earlier it was working in my Linux
69:22 - machine
69:25 - uh let me check with
69:30 - it
69:33 - um and also let's go with the rmd SL s
69:38 - okay Google is your friend bu like if
69:40 - you will stuck somewhere then this is
69:42 - your only friend where you will get the
69:44 - help okay okay so here is the like
69:48 - documentation of Microsoft then if it is
69:50 - Microsoft then like it should be correct
69:54 - here sles what it's saying delet a
69:56 - directory tree this specif direct and
69:58 - all subir including all files okay we
70:01 - work
70:02 - correct and this rmd SLS test to remove
70:06 - directly name test and
70:09 - all
70:10 - okay we were doing the same thing I
70:13 - didn't get why it's not working in a uh
70:16 - like there may be some
70:20 - reason uh here you can see like there is
70:25 - uh there may be okay uh leave it uh I
70:29 - will try one once more let's check it
70:32 - happens or not I try to create again the
70:34 - same directory I will just hit
70:40 - the what was the command rmd sles and uh
70:45 - I one is
70:48 - there okay okay okay okay
70:51 - okay fail to remove
70:55 - okay if I do forcefully then what
70:59 - happens okay it's not working
71:04 - even so now what is the options to
71:08 - delete the whole directory in single
71:10 - command like uh sles failed in I don't
71:14 - know why we will figure it out later uh
71:17 - but now what is the other way so there
71:18 - is a way so what we will do we can use
71:22 - the RM command okay with the help of
71:25 - this command we can easily delete all
71:27 - the files like in a single command what
71:30 - we will use the flag with it RM hyph RF
71:33 - okay and then a
71:35 - one done we are done buddy like RF
71:40 - stands for recursively and F stands for
71:42 - forcefully we can easily use this RM
71:45 - command to remove these directories in a
71:47 - one single command
71:49 - Okay so uh that's all for um today I
71:54 - hope you got it like uh how we can
71:56 - delete the directories uh in this uh by
71:59 - using a particular single command or by
72:01 - one by one command like basically uh in
72:03 - the like uh real world we basically use
72:07 - this RMI an RF okay we use it uh because
72:11 - uh like uh whenever we create a direct
72:14 - it will not be mty like you can get it
72:18 - you can relate it with it like whenever
72:20 - you create then you create it for some
72:21 - kind of purpose that's why so we can
72:24 - easily use this RM RF command for this
72:27 - uh removing directory okay so that's all
72:29 - for today uh I hope you liked it uh I
72:33 - hope and uh if you have any query then
72:36 - please you can ask us in comment section
72:38 - and yeah please do like share and
72:39 - subscribe our Channel and yeah thank you
72:41 - thank you for watching this
72:44 - video how we can create files in Linux
72:46 - using touch command okay so here and
72:48 - here in both sides there is files here
72:50 - is files okay and I will move into to
72:53 - that particular
72:55 - directory files okay and now what I will
72:59 - do I will create some files using touch
73:02 - command okay so I will do Touch file
73:07 - 1.txt okay so basically what this
73:11 - command will do it will just like delete
73:13 - the uh sorry I'm saying delete it will
73:15 - just create file one.txt okay but that
73:19 - file will be empty for you like there
73:22 - will you cannot write anything at that
73:24 - time you will need to first open that
73:26 - file then you will need to write in that
73:27 - it okay but there are also some ways
73:30 - where we can perform both thing like uh
73:34 - simultaneously we can like create files
73:36 - and we can write something uh in that
73:38 - also but this we will see in the next
73:40 - video okay so first we will uh talk
73:43 - about this touch command so when will
73:46 - hit
73:47 - enter and I will do LS and here you will
73:50 - see like file 1.txt
73:53 - will be created okay so I hope it is
73:58 - clear to you and now what if I want to
74:00 - create multiple files okay then I can
74:03 - easily do with file 2.txt
74:07 - file 3.txt
74:10 - file 4.
74:13 - txt and I will just hit enter uh sorry
74:17 - LS and here you can see all these and
74:20 - four files have been created okay so
74:23 - this is the one way to create files okay
74:26 - and now with the touch command like we
74:28 - can use various options with it like
74:31 - hyphen a hyphen M hyphen R also we can
74:36 - use it so I will start with the first
74:39 - one that is hyphen a option basically
74:42 - what this option does like it will
74:44 - change the access time of your file
74:48 - suppose uh now we have created this file
74:50 - let me do LS hyphen l
74:53 - okay so file one has been created at uh
74:57 - this one 12:42 a.m. okay and this is 43
75:02 - and all these things so basically this
75:04 - is the modification time okay if you
75:06 - want to look at the access time you will
75:09 - need to hit LS hyph
75:11 - luu okay uh access time 42 okay The
75:17 - Hyphen L option will show you the
75:19 - modification time hyphen Lu option will
75:21 - show you the access time when the file
75:23 - is accessed okay so what I'm going to
75:28 - do I will try to access this file and
75:31 - now 1244 it is okay so I have access
75:35 - this file okay and will write something
75:39 - High okay and I will just uh close it
75:43 - and again I will do this I will need to
75:46 - find the excess time so here you can see
75:49 - the 1244 is now the access time of file
75:53 - 1.txt okay and I have not visited file
75:57 - 2.txt yet okay so it's access time it is
76:00 - still showing
76:01 - 1243 so now what I have to
76:04 - do I will change the access time using
76:07 - the hyphen a option so how we can do it
76:11 - touch hyphen a and then file name so I
76:16 - want to change the access time for file
76:19 - name uh which one uh let's do for file 1
76:23 - txt okay so it will change my access
76:26 - time from 12:44 to the my current time
76:29 - so my current time is what 12:45
76:34 - okay and now I will do LS IU and here
76:38 - you can see file 1.txt
76:41 - okay now what I will
76:43 - do like here we have not uh like uh
76:48 - visited this file 2.txt okay even when
76:52 - you don't open on that file we don't
76:54 - write anything in that but file still
76:56 - you can change the access time for it
76:58 - okay Suppose there is someone in your
77:01 - like work environment like uh you want
77:03 - to change the access time uh just for
77:06 - your any kind of purpose
77:08 - okay so what I'm going to do
77:12 - uh touch hyph I will just uh change the
77:17 - file name from file 1 to
77:20 - two Okay and now I will do LS
77:24 - hyphen Lu and here you can see the
77:27 - access time for File 2 has been like
77:31 - change now okay it's
77:34 - 1246 okay and now uh I will just clear
77:38 - it all now again I will check the access
77:41 - time so access time is for first one
77:43 - 12:45
77:45 - 1246 and for let's check for
77:47 - modification time that is at the
77:50 - modification this is sh 1244
77:53 - okay and 1243 1243 all the why 1244
77:58 - because uh we we have write high in this
78:01 - file 1.x that's why it's going
78:03 - 1244 okay now what if you want to change
78:07 - the modification time instead of uh this
78:10 - access time so what I will do now I will
78:13 - just hit uh uh like work with the hyphen
78:16 - M option okay hyphen
78:20 - M and I will change for
78:23 - file 3.txt
78:26 - and now let's do just LS hyph L file 3
78:31 - you can do like this also and now it's
78:34 - swing
78:35 - 1247 as here it was 1243 now the it is
78:39 - modified to the
78:41 - 1247 and here you can see the access
78:43 - time is 12:43 so now let's check also
78:47 - the access time for file 3.txt whether
78:49 - it is change or not it will not change
78:51 - because we have not done anything with
78:52 - it so it will be as it is like it is
78:55 - 12:43 okay so I hope you got it how it
78:59 - is working the how we can basically
79:01 - change the access time modification time
79:03 - with the touch command okay we are
79:05 - creating files also and we can also
79:07 - manipulate the access time and the
79:08 - modification I'm using this
79:10 - command okay so now uh moving uh forward
79:14 - uh the there is also one option hyphen R
79:17 - okay so basically this option what it
79:19 - will do it will just uh uh like
79:23 - uh what we can say like copy the access
79:26 - time of first file to the second file
79:29 - okay so now what I will need to
79:32 - do I will show you both the
79:37 - uh access time I will show you for file
79:40 - 1. XT and what I will do touch hyph
79:45 - R file one and
79:49 - file 2.txt okay and and again I will do
79:53 - the ls hyph
79:55 - Lu so here you can see the access time
79:58 - for file 2.txt has been change from 1246
80:02 - to
80:03 - 12:45 and now let's check for the
80:06 - modification time for file 1 and file 2
80:09 - so modification time for file one and
80:11 - file two is same okay I hope you got it
80:15 - how it is working in the excess time and
80:17 - notification time I hope you got the
80:19 - like how hyphen a hyphen M and and
80:22 - iPhone R option works together okay so
80:26 - that's all for this video and in the
80:28 - next video we will basically talk about
80:30 - uh how we can write some kind of like
80:33 - whatever you have to write in the file
80:35 - while creating a file okay so that's it
80:38 - for today and we will meet in the next
80:40 - one so thank you thank you for watching
80:42 - and please do like share and subscribe
80:44 - our Channel and if you have any queries
80:46 - then you can ask us in the comment
80:47 - section okay thank you thank you for
80:50 - watching and now in this video we will
80:52 - talk talk about uh how we can create
80:54 - files using cat command and also we will
80:56 - see some other operations using cat
80:58 - command Okay so uh let me increase the
81:01 - size of the terminal I think now it's
81:03 - fine and I will just open up my file
81:07 - system in my left hand sign
81:09 - to be more clear with you guys okay so
81:13 - now what we will need to do uh we will
81:15 - we will have to learn about uh cat
81:17 - command okay so basically cat command uh
81:20 - we can use to create files and also we
81:22 - can use use this cat command to like
81:24 - concatenate some more files together or
81:27 - you can say like merging more than one
81:29 - file in a one single file okay you can
81:31 - also do it in this and also uh we can
81:34 - use it like uh like to get the how many
81:38 - uh numbers like to show the lines and
81:40 - all those things in this in the
81:41 - particular files okay so now we will
81:44 - start with the creating file
81:46 - okay so let me do first LS so I think I
81:49 - have some files directory let me check
81:53 - what is there okay file on file 4 okay I
81:56 - know what is
81:58 - uh let's create some files with cat
82:02 - command Okay so cat I will go with the
82:06 - test 1.txt and what here the main
82:10 - benefit is that we can simultaneously
82:12 - write whatever we want to write in that
82:14 - particular test file so here I'm just
82:17 - writing this
82:19 - is test one file okay in txt
82:25 - format and what you have to do you have
82:27 - to just hit enter and then control T
82:29 - okay so in this way we can create files
82:32 - okay and uh now what we have to do we
82:36 - have to do LS and here you will see test
82:38 - one.txt has been created for you and
82:40 - here also you can see it okay now now
82:43 - the other feature of cat command is that
82:46 - like uh you can also read the contents
82:48 - of that text file so how you can do it
82:51 - you can just C and then the whatever the
82:54 - file name is there you can provide it
82:56 - okay that test one. XT I will hit enter
83:00 - and here you will see the whatever is
83:03 - the content of the file um like it is
83:06 - being printed here okay so uh this is
83:10 - the like two operations we covered and
83:12 - now what we will need to do uh I will
83:15 - create one more file okay uh
83:19 - cat test to. XT okay and here I will
83:24 - write this
83:26 - is test two file
83:30 - in txt format okay just hit enter and
83:34 - then contr D and now what we will do we
83:37 - will see the content of test2.txt and
83:40 - here you can see this is test2 file in
83:43 - txt format okay now what we will I need
83:47 - to do what I will do I will try to like
83:51 - concatenate like uh what you can say
83:54 - test test two conent in test one okay so
83:58 - how I can do it
83:59 - cat test one.txt then again this
84:04 - redirection operator this is called
84:06 - redirection operator and test 2.txt hit
84:10 - enter I will try to see the content of
84:13 - first uh test one let's see what is
84:16 - there okay so basically this command
84:19 - like will pend in test to.tx not in t
84:22 - sorry for that okay test two and here
84:26 - you can see like the whatever the
84:29 - content of test one file has been
84:32 - included in this particular test two
84:35 - file okay from here you can see also
84:36 - like when I will just hit double click
84:39 - on it and here you can see the same
84:41 - thing here also
84:43 - okay so this is the one way of like
84:46 - appending uh two files together okay and
84:50 - what we can do uh if you
84:53 - want like append content of those file
84:57 - in another some file like suppose like
84:59 - test three file so what we will do we
85:03 - will there just simple uh
85:06 - cat uh test1.txt
85:10 - test2.txt
85:12 - and then I thing just uh redirection
85:15 - operator and here we will write test
85:17 - 3.txt and now what we will do we will
85:21 - see here like test three has been
85:23 - created also when we will do LS head you
85:25 - can see test three has been created now
85:28 - what we will do I will try to read the
85:30 - content of test
85:33 - 3 test 3.txt
85:38 - okay oh so here you can see the content
85:42 - of both the files like this is showing
85:44 - test one two times because in test two
85:46 - uh it was there like this was the
85:48 - content of test two file okay so in this
85:51 - way we can uh like merge multiple files
85:54 - as many you want okay and uh now moving
85:58 - forward like uh now we will learn about
86:00 - some like uh what we can say little bit
86:04 - uh options which we can use with this
86:05 - cat command so first of I will uh I want
86:10 - to show you is cat hyphen
86:13 - n test 3.txt
86:16 - so this command basically what it does
86:19 - it uh uh basically like show you the
86:22 - lines with number wise okay here you can
86:24 - see this is first line This is second
86:26 - line This is third line and similarly
86:27 - here also you can see the uh like uh all
86:30 - those things like 1 2 3
86:33 - okay
86:35 - so this is the one way uh to like get
86:38 - the files by number wise and if you want
86:41 - to uh check the like end where is the
86:46 - ending of that all the line then at that
86:49 - time it will show you the dollar
86:50 - character at the end end of the line
86:56 - okay here you can see like here the line
86:59 - is ending that's why it is Swing dollar
87:01 - here what if we will do uh here I will
87:06 - change little bit uh like here I will
87:09 - change like uh this is uh another file
87:15 - and I will just hit control s and full
87:17 - stop
87:19 - also and let me cut this
87:24 - and here you can see the line is ending
87:26 - here okay so I hope you got it why swing
87:30 - dollar dollar is because like here at
87:32 - this point of uh line
87:35 - uh sentence or at this point of word
87:38 - thus line has been ended so that's why
87:41 - here it is Swing dollar okay so this is
87:44 - the basic use of hyphen e command okay
87:49 - now uh what if you want to add like uh
87:54 - uh some more content in uh like previous
87:57 - file previous file means like it is
87:59 - already created you don't have to create
88:02 - anything for it so for that you don't
88:04 - have to do anything uh you have to just
88:08 - uh apply double redirection that is this
88:11 - one get and suppose I want to write in
88:14 - test one.txt
88:17 - okay and here first we will see the
88:19 - content of this so here you can see this
88:21 - is test on file in text format and I
88:24 - have to write uh something like this is
88:28 - uh
88:30 - tutorial based on Linux uh CTS or
88:36 - something like that okay and just hit
88:38 - control D okay and I will just uh like
88:42 - uh reopen this particular
88:48 - file
88:50 - um okay so here you can see like uh this
88:54 - isial based on has been like added in
88:58 - this particular test one.txt file
89:02 - okay and uh uh there is also one like uh
89:06 - option which we can see like uh hyphen T
89:10 - option okay so basically what it does uh
89:13 - it will show you the tab like where
89:17 - where is the tab in the particular line
89:20 - okay so what I will do now I will just
89:25 - uh like uh give a tab here okay one tab
89:31 - two tab three tab I'm giving here okay
89:35 - and justrl S and the tab will be
89:39 - represented by this this symbol I think
89:42 - let's see what it shows cat file one
89:48 - dot uh sorry what is the file name okay
89:51 - test one do
89:52 - txt test one.
89:55 - txt okay so uh this is the content which
89:59 - we so now what I will do I will just
90:02 - have to use the Hy option and here you
90:06 - can see uh this is uh the particular
90:10 - symbol and I I I it's showing like three
90:13 - tabs is there it is showing that's it
90:16 - okay so uh uh that's all about uh like
90:21 - uh this scat command okay I hope you
90:23 - liked it and if you have any issue or if

96:21 - options like uh hyphen V okay what it
96:25 - does
96:28 - sorry if I will go with hyphen V option

96:52 - okay
96:55 - sorry so these are the four files which
96:58 - have been deleted and you have got the
97:00 - information like what was going on after
97:03 - like hitting this particular command
97:05 - okay so hyph we only just display the
97:08 - what is going on okay and now let's move
97:12 - towards like uh directories okay how we
97:16 - can delete uh empty directories or uh
97:20 - like nonempty Direct
97:22 - so let me create One Directory hyphen p
97:25 - uh I will choose with the uh A1 A2
97:32 - A3 okay so uh like
97:37 - uh are you uh you will get like in A1
97:41 - directory there will be A2 in A2 there
97:42 - will be A3 directory okay so I will do
97:45 - LS and uh if you want to go in the A1
97:49 - directory so when you will to LS said
97:51 - you will get the A2 directory okay so in
97:54 - similar way in A2 there is A3 now I go
97:56 - in the home directory I will clear the
97:58 - screen now I want to remove this
98:01 - particular directory to remove
98:02 - directories which is non empty like in
98:05 - A1 there is something okay so for this
98:09 - we basically use the r option with r we
98:12 - can use f f option for forcefully
98:15 - deleting okay but we are not using here
98:17 - it okay so I will just go with the A1
98:21 - and I will just hit enter and all the
98:23 - directories will get deleted okay if I
98:26 - do LS so that you will see there is no
98:28 - A1 now what I will do I will just create
98:31 - again those directories and uh I will
98:35 - run with the iPhone V option okay and
98:40 - here we'll see remove directory first A3
98:43 - then A2 then
98:45 - A1 okay uh if you want to use hyphone I
98:49 - option then also you can use
98:51 - a small
98:53 - I it will ask you yes then it will ask
98:57 - you for the next you yes then next you
99:01 - have to do yes so remove directory A1 A2
99:04 - A2 then again y then again for the final
99:08 - one so in this way uh like uh we can use
99:13 - the RM command with the hyph V iir and
99:17 - these are all options okay now if you
99:20 - want to delete uh like
99:25 - um uh empty
99:27 - directory okay so this is a empty
99:30 - directory there is nothing in s0 you can
99:33 - also do with r option but uh there is
99:35 - also one more like uh uh what you can
99:38 - say flag or option is D we Bic deletes
99:42 - the empty directories we lo as 0 0 and
99:45 - it will delete
99:47 - the okay so test 0 has been deleted
99:51 - now uh again I will show you with the
99:53 - hyphen V option so you can get the like
99:57 - confirmation or there should be no any
99:59 - confusion regarding things okay so hyph
100:02 - V and yeah remove director t 0 okay so
100:06 - uh that's all for today and I hope you
100:08 - liked it about this uh like how we can
100:11 - remove files and directories with the RM
100:14 - command as this is a basic Linux command
100:16 - okay and now today in this video we are
100:18 - going to talk about one of the more
100:19 - basic command that is a
100:21 - CP command Okay so CP stands for just uh
100:24 - like copy okay what we will do like
100:27 - basically we will copy files and
100:29 - directories from One Directory to
100:31 - another or from one file to another just
100:33 - like in Windows we do right click and
100:35 - click on copy and all so same thing uh
100:38 - like will happen here but using command
100:41 - line okay or you can say using CP
100:43 - command Okay so let's start the tutorial
100:46 - uh first of all open up the
100:49 - terminal
100:51 - and let me increase the font size for
100:55 - you okay now it's okay and open this
100:59 - files uh like for your reference
101:04 - okay
101:06 - okay so here it
101:09 - is now what I will do LS so here are
101:12 - some files
101:14 - okay uh let me create uh One Directory
101:19 - copy command okay I will move into this
101:23 - particular directory and here also I
101:26 - will move in that
101:29 - directory okay so here you can see uh
101:32 - there is no any files or directories
101:34 - here what I want to create I want to
101:37 - create uh files uh let's create one.txt
101:45 - I will write this as
101:48 - 1.txt file
101:52 - contr D okay here you can see 1. XT file
101:55 - has been created now what if you want to
101:57 - create uh the copy of this particular
102:01 - text file okay so how you can do
102:04 - it so to perform this action we have a
102:07 - basic command that is CP command okay it
102:10 - stands for copy so what we will do in a
102:12 - basic simple way we will just give the
102:15 - file name 1. XT and where you want to
102:19 - create that particular copy I want to
102:21 - create in the same directory so I will
102:22 - just give the name of that file in which
102:24 - I want to uh like copy that file so here
102:29 - you will see 2. XT is not there okay so
102:33 - what will happen in this case like if
102:35 - the file exists so it will overwrite
102:37 - simply overwrite the whatever you have
102:39 - written but if file doesn't exist so it
102:42 - will create and then after that it will
102:45 - copy the content of 1. text into 2. text
102:48 - okay so let me do LS and I will try to
102:51 - read 2. 2.txt so here you can see the
102:55 - content of this particular like
102:58 - uh particular 1.txt
103:02 - file
103:03 - okay so this is the like one of the
103:06 - simple way in which we can copy files
103:08 - and files okay so now uh what I want I
103:13 - want to copy this uh 1. TT file into
103:16 - some other locations so how we can do it
103:19 - so uh like
103:22 - right now where you are let's check you
103:24 - are in the this home iush copy command
103:28 - okay I will try to split the terminal so
103:31 - that will
103:32 - be uh helpful let me uh like create one
103:36 - more
103:37 - terminal control shift plus I hope it is
103:41 - visible to
103:46 - you let me just reduce some size
103:53 - okay so now what I will do I will do LS
103:56 - here okay now uh let's do
104:01 - PWD okay and uh you are in the home aush
104:06 - right now I will just copy this like
104:11 - uh path now what I want I want to copy
104:16 - this CP 1.txt
104:19 - file
104:23 - at oh
104:29 - sorry 1.txt file let me
104:34 - paste home iush okay and here I will
104:38 - create
104:39 - 2.txt
104:41 - so here you can see there is no any
104:43 - 2.txt kind of file let's hit enter and
104:48 - here you will see uh let's to LS and
104:51 - here will you will see true. txt has
104:53 - been created let me open the like check
104:57 - the content of that particular
104:58 - file so here it is this is 1.txt
105:02 - file okay uh like uh it was a like a
105:06 - little bit uh like difficult because you
105:08 - will need to give the whole path uh
105:11 - where you want uh to copy that
105:13 - particular
105:14 - file okay so in this way you can copy uh
105:17 - this uh like files in any you want you
105:21 - will just need to give the like whole
105:23 - path okay where you want to copy that
105:26 - particular file now one more thing I
105:28 - want to tell you
105:30 - guys let me clear the screen here also I
105:32 - will do LS here okay now what I want I
105:36 - uh like want to copy that file okay but
105:40 - what if uh 2.txt file already
105:43 - exist okay so what will happen
105:47 - so now what I will do uh uh I
105:51 - [Music]
105:52 - will add some more text in 1.txt
105:59 - some
106:02 - more text has been added in this file
106:07 - okay contr
106:10 - D now uh let's check the content of the
106:13 - 1.txt so here you can see this uh 1.txt
106:17 - contain and let's check the container
106:19 - 2.txt it should be uh like as a similar
106:22 - one 1. TT
106:25 - okay now what we will need to do I will
106:28 - also need to copy this uh 1. txt into
106:31 - 2.txt okay so I will just try
106:35 - to uh hit the like previous command but
106:39 - here what I will use I will just hit the
106:41 - hyphen I option okay why hyph I option
106:46 - it will just prompt you for file over
106:49 - written thing like if file already exist
106:52 - so it will prompt like whether you want
106:56 - to overwrite the content of one.txt or
106:59 - not like because there is something else
107:01 - in the two.txt if you will like without
107:05 - hyph I you will run this command so it
107:07 - will simply overwrite the content of
107:09 - 1.txt into 2.txt but using hyph I what
107:12 - it will do it will just prompt you for
107:16 - your decision whether you want to
107:18 - override or not okay so let's hit enter
107:22 - and here you can see it is asking for
107:24 - overwrite and question mark uh whether
107:27 - yes or no I will just hit
107:29 - yes now I will try to check the content
107:33 - of this 2.txt
107:34 - file so here you can see like it has
107:37 - been
107:38 - copied okay I hope you got it how you
107:42 - can do it also now what if I want to
107:46 - copy like uh file one and file file to
107:50 - into some other
107:52 - directory okay
107:55 - so uh let me uh like uh check LS so here
108:00 - you can see 1.txt and 2.txt file is
108:03 - there now what I want I want 1.txt
108:08 - 2.txt into some another
108:11 - directory uh same here in is the same
108:14 - case if directory exist then it will
108:17 - like
108:18 - um uh like copy this files if directory
108:22 - doesn't exist then it will create a
108:23 - directory and then after it will copy
108:25 - that like these files into that
108:27 - particular directory
108:29 - okay so how you can do
108:33 - it uh copy 1. now directory name so
108:38 - uh uh what you can
108:42 - write copied
108:45 - files okay uh let me hit enter okay is
108:51 - not a directory I think I will need to
108:52 - use hyphone R option
109:03 - maybe
109:13 - okay uh let me create a directory copied
109:19 - files
109:21 - and now let me try to copy these
109:25 - uh files into it okay okay
109:29 - sorry uh check Lis I will move into this
109:33 - directory and I will LS okay okay now
109:37 - now these files has been ComEd so in
109:39 - this case like uh it is not uh uh
109:42 - creating directory if uh that directory
109:44 - doesn't
109:46 - exist
109:48 - okay so uh like like in this way you can
109:51 - like copy uh like more than one files or
109:56 - into some another directory
110:01 - okay now uh one more option is there
110:03 - like if you want to
110:05 - copy uh like One Directory to some
110:08 - another directory you want to make a
110:09 - copy of directories okay so how you can
110:12 - do it I will move into
110:14 - the home
110:16 - directory uh let me clear the screen and
110:19 - then LS
110:22 - okay so what I want do I want this copy
110:25 - command the copy of
110:27 - this copy command directory so I will
110:30 - use CP hyph R for recursive so it is Ed
110:33 - for the directory
110:36 - copies okay so how you can do
110:40 - it you will give
110:43 - the first uh the this uh directory name
110:46 - and another directory in which you want
110:49 - so
110:51 - I will use copy
110:54 - command
110:56 - V2 and hit enter and H to LS and here
111:00 - you will see copy command V2 has been
111:02 - created now let's move into this
111:04 - particular
111:06 - directory and LS so here you can see
111:09 - like director has been like copied okay
111:13 - so in this way uh you can uh play with
111:16 - the copy command and all okay so that's
111:19 - all for today's video now in this video
111:20 - we will talk about uh like one of the
111:23 - basic command that is MV command it like
111:25 - it basically stands for move so
111:28 - basically in this video we will talk
111:29 - about how we can move files from one
111:31 - location to another or also you can say
111:35 - like how we can move directory from one
111:37 - location to another location okay so
111:40 - today in this video we're going to learn
111:42 - about this like how we can move files
111:44 - from one location to another so first of
111:46 - all let me open up the
111:48 - terminal
111:51 - and now let me just increase the font
111:53 - size for you guys so it should be
111:55 - visible to you and I will just open up
111:57 - this
111:58 - files for your reference so whatever we
112:02 - will perform here it will be visible to
112:03 - you guys
112:07 - okay okay so now what I will do first of
112:13 - all I will create One Directory mkd
112:17 - move move command okay
112:20 - and uh now what we will need to do let
112:23 - me clear I will move into that
112:27 - particular directory and I will create
112:29 - one file
112:32 - Touch file 1.txt we will create
112:36 - okay and here is Touch file 1.txt
112:41 - okay
112:42 - uh also let me no wait a
112:48 - minute I will try to create a file with
112:52 - cat command because I have to write
112:54 - something in
112:58 - it this is file
113:02 - one control D okay now it is
113:05 - save now uh what we will do I have to
113:09 - move this file one.txt
113:13 - okay file 1.txt from this move move
113:18 - command directory to some another
113:20 - directory that is I have to move this
113:22 - onto suppose desktop okay so now what I
113:26 - will do uh first of all I will open up
113:30 - one more
113:32 - terminal and
113:35 - uh I will move into the CD desktop okay
113:40 - I will do PWD I will check the like path
113:43 - of that particular desktop where it is
113:47 - so here you can
113:48 - see home home I use desktop okay so now
113:52 - what we will
113:54 - do I will use here
113:58 - MV like stands for move I have to move
114:02 - file 1.txt
114:04 - to
114:06 - home
114:09 - iush desktop and here what you can do
114:13 - like like this command is also useful
114:16 - like changing the name like we can also
114:19 - name files okay but here I'm going to
114:22 - use only
114:23 - file.txt
114:26 - okay and I will hit enter and uh on the
114:30 - desktop I will do here LS so here you
114:33 - will see file.txt has been like created
114:38 - okay or uh you can see here also on the
114:43 - desktop uh I think it
114:46 - is here here you can see the file do
114:49 - text has been created
114:54 - okay so uh this is the basics of how we
114:58 - can move files from one location to
115:00 - another now like this command is also
115:02 - useful in renaming files okay so if I
115:05 - will to LS so there is nothing because
115:07 - we have already moved it uh let's create
115:09 - another file
115:11 - cat file
115:14 - 2.txt
115:16 - this
115:17 - is File 2
115:20 - okay and this and now what I want I want
115:23 - to rename this file file two I want to
115:25 - make it file three so we can do it MV
115:29 - File 2
115:31 - s here I will do just file 3.txt and I
115:35 - will do LS and here you will see the
115:37 - name of the file two has been changed to
115:40 - file three now let's check the content
115:43 - of file 3 whether it is same or not so
115:45 - cat file three so it is this is file two
115:48 - okay
115:50 - so in this way you can also rename the
115:52 - like file names
115:54 - okay I hope you got it uh now let me
115:57 - tell you one more another thing like uh
116:01 - if suppose uh here is file.txt okay on
116:05 - the
116:05 - desktop and uh you want to move that uh
116:10 - file one which is here to move into this
116:13 - particular directory or particular
116:16 - location so if already file 1 txt like
116:21 - uh exist here so what will happen when
116:25 - we will like uh try to move files from
116:30 - this location to this location with the
116:31 - same then it will override so to
116:34 - overcome overcome this issue what we
116:36 - will use we will use hyphen I command
116:39 - not command hyphen I flag we will
116:41 - use okay first what I will do I
116:44 - [Music]
116:45 - will uh change the file name to file one
116:50 - not file one file. text I will
116:53 - change LS okay now what I will do MV
116:57 - file. txt
117:00 - then home
117:03 - iuse desktop and again file Dot txt and
117:09 - here I will use hyphen I
117:13 - option and here you can see override do
117:15 - you want to override this particular
117:17 - file which it exist it is asking so I
117:20 - can say yes or no but before uh let's
117:22 - check the content of this
117:24 - file this is file 188 is showing now I
117:27 - will do
117:28 - yes and
117:31 - uh hit
117:35 - enter and now I will
117:41 - again check the content of this file so
117:44 - here you can see this is file two okay I
117:47 - hope it is visible to you yeah this is
117:49 - this file two is the now the like uh
117:53 - decent content of this file because it
117:55 - is overwritten
117:57 - okay now next uh what are we I have to
118:01 - do I will try to move uh like uh some
118:07 - files into one particular directory okay
118:10 - so what I will do I will create uh two
118:14 - files 1.txt
118:17 - 2.txt
118:19 - now let's create here TT also okay now
118:22 - you can see LS so these are the th which
118:24 - we have created now I will um make a
118:28 - directory here on the desktop
118:31 - mkd uh move
118:34 - files okay now what I will do
118:38 - MV 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt
118:43 - into the directory home
118:47 - iuse desktop on on nextt to what we
118:52 - have move files we'll hit enter and
118:56 - we'll do LS so here we can see there is
118:58 - no any files here now I will move into
119:01 - the move files and I will do LS so here
119:04 - you can see all the files has been like
119:06 - moved at this particular locations okay
119:09 - so uh this is the another way to like
119:12 - moving files from one location to
119:14 - another like from uh one location to any
119:17 - kind of directory in which you want okay
119:20 - now moving uh forward uh what we can do
119:23 - uh like how you can copy like One
119:28 - Directory to another location okay or
119:31 - renaming it
119:33 - okay so let me go back here and now at
119:38 - desktop here you can see move files and
119:41 - one directory that is test directory
119:43 - okay now what I want I want to First
119:48 - rename this this file or this directory
119:52 - so move files I will try to rename
119:56 - it m
119:59 - files now so here you can see the like
120:03 - move files has been changed to m files
120:05 - now what now I want to move this m files
120:08 - into this tester
120:09 - directory uh so what I can do MV m
120:16 - files and then the test
120:20 - enter LS there's no m files here now CD
120:25 - changeed to test now let's do
120:29 - LS and here you can see m files has been
120:32 - moved at this particular location or you
120:35 - can say add the test
120:37 - directory okay so in this way uh like
120:41 - you can move files from one location to
120:42 - another or from One Directory to another
120:47 - or how you can also re name files and
120:49 - also so in this video you learn about it
120:53 - so today we will stop here and we will
120:55 - meet in the next video so thank you
120:57 - thank you for watching and please if you
120:59 - have any queries then you can ask us in
121:01 - the comment section okay hello guys and
121:03 - welcome back to the channel this is aush
121:06 - and now in this video here is the test
121:08 - for you guys till the topics which we
121:10 - have covered till now I think till MV
121:11 - command we have covered so in this uh
121:14 - test we have approx 15 questions which
121:17 - will be given by you and after that you
121:19 - will get the uh each like one point for
121:23 - every correct answer and you will get
121:25 - the link of this form in the description
121:28 - of this video okay so best of luck for
121:31 - it and I hope you will do great and we
121:34 - will meet in the next video okay
121:38 - bye-bye now in this video we will cover
121:41 - the zip command okay so basically uh as
121:44 - you are aware of zip like weip files to
121:47 - compress the size of that particular
121:48 - directory
121:49 - particular file which we use okay
121:51 - suppose you want to transfer a file of
121:53 - 500 MB to your friend okay but uh uh you
121:58 - want to compress that file and after
122:00 - that you want to send it to that your
122:02 - friend so when you zip that file so the
122:05 - size will be automatically decreased
122:06 - okay so that's why we use a zip command
122:09 - so basically in the Linux we will use
122:11 - the zip command okay for zipping the
122:14 - files and directories okay but in
122:17 - U windows uh you use uh that particular
122:21 - GOI to zip the files okay so now in this
122:24 - video what we are going to do we will
122:26 - first of all create a One
122:28 - Directory MK zip and let's move into
122:32 - this directory it also maybe zip has
122:35 - been created yes here it is now what we
122:37 - will do I'll create multiple
122:39 - files uh 1. txt 2.txt 3 do txt okay so
122:48 - basically on in a simple way how you can
122:50 - zip file without any option so this is a
122:53 - just simple like you zip and the file
122:55 - name which you want to give to that
122:58 - particular uh ZIP file so I I'm giving
123:01 - it the file.zip and the particular files
123:03 - which you want
123:06 - to which you want to add in that
123:11 - particular zip file okay so now what we
123:15 - can do uh I will just hit enter and here
123:18 - you can see file zip has been created
123:20 - now in this particular uh ZIP file you
123:24 - can see 1. TT has been added okay so but
123:27 - what if uh you want to add multiple
123:29 - files okay if you want to add multi
123:32 - multiple files in your uh that
123:35 - particular this ZIP so how you can do it
123:39 - so for this what you will do I'm I'm
123:41 - going to create another Z file Z File
123:45 - 2. 1.txt 2 do
123:49 - txt 3.txt
123:52 - and again here you can see file to.ip in
123:54 - this we will get actually three files
123:58 - okay 1 2 3. T we are getting here so
124:01 - this is the way of zipping multiple
124:04 - files together okay in uh particular uh
124:08 - ZIP file in which you want so now what
124:10 - we are going to do I'm again going to
124:12 - create some more
124:14 - files touch 4. text 5. text
124:19 - 6. txt okay so now what I want to do I'm
124:23 - going to zip uh 4. txt and file 3.zip
124:30 - file okay so the option is one of the
124:34 - option of the zip command is hyphen you
124:36 - option which we can use to like uh uh
124:40 - add some other files in that particular
124:42 - zip file uh it means like uh in the file
124:47 - 3.zip right now we have have only 4. txt
124:51 - okay so what I'm going to do I will add
124:54 - five and six also without tampering
124:57 - four so the there is a hyphen you option
125:00 - in the zip command okay which we can use
125:04 - to perform that particular action so I'm
125:08 - going to add here 5. txt and also 6. txt
125:13 - and now I will open up this uh ZIP file
125:16 - and here you can see 456 has been added
125:18 - okay so we will cover unzip in next
125:21 - video uh that's why I'm going I'm
125:22 - showing you like this okay that's why
125:25 - I'm not unzipping it with the CMD okay
125:28 - so in this way you can add uh other
125:30 - files also and one more option is there
125:33 - like uh hyon M option so what it does
125:36 - it's basically like it will zip the file
125:39 - and it will also delete that particular
125:41 - file sometimes in case uh you don't want
125:44 - to uh like um what we can say keep that
125:48 - particular particular file okay in your
125:50 - desk or to save your space or something
125:52 - like that you can think of it so how we
125:54 - can do it uh like here is Ls I'm going
125:57 - to do and here is 6. till1 to 6. txt is
126:01 - file now what I'm going to do zip hyph M
126:05 - I
126:06 - will use file
126:09 - 4. and I will add suppose 4. txt 5. 6.
126:15 - txt hit enter adding all those things
126:18 - and here you can see all the four to
126:20 - six. txt file has been deleted and here
126:24 - in the file for. J we will get the 4 56.
126:27 - txt files so using hyph you can uh like
126:32 - uh ZIP that all files and also uh you
126:36 - can delete that files to save your space
126:38 - H you will not need to delete that file
126:41 - after the zipping of all that things
126:43 - okay so now moving forward what we can
126:46 - do so uh suppose if you have have other
126:49 - directories also like uh with txt files
126:51 - you have some other directories so how
126:53 - you can do it how you can zip that also
126:56 - so you can do that in a recursive manner
126:59 - uh like using iPhone R option so first
127:01 - of all what I'm going to do I will just
127:03 - create some other director like let's
127:06 - create test okay I have created test
127:10 - directory and you have to like
127:14 - uh what you can say you have to add one
127:18 - to 3. txt files also and also
127:21 - test uh directory in one G file how you
127:25 - can do it you have to just use hyphen R
127:27 - option so hyphen R option what it does
127:30 - it basically work as a recursive manner
127:32 - like it will uh ZIP your directory and
127:36 - also file switch you you will use so
127:39 - let's uh give it a name as di do zip and
127:43 - then what we can do 1. txt 2.txt 3. txt
127:49 - and the name of the file not file
127:53 - directory enter and
127:57 - uh where it is
128:01 - D.Z and here you can see all of your
128:04 - files has been added into that
128:06 - particular zip file okay so in this way
128:10 - you can uh add some other like more than
128:14 - files and directories in one zip file
128:16 - using a single command using hyph option
128:19 - mostly it happens mostly we use it in
128:22 - like uh in our Windows system like we
128:26 - have multiple files in One Directory
128:28 - also some other directory so you can
128:30 - basically like use it in this case and
128:33 - one more important thing and the last
128:35 - one the last option which we will see
128:37 - together is hyphen e option okay it
128:40 - basically stands for encrypt so what it
128:42 - does
128:44 - uh let
128:46 - me like what I will do I will add this
128:49 - 1.txt file into one zip file with a
128:52 - password okay basically it will create a
128:55 - zip file with an password so how you can
128:57 - do it zip I will write
129:02 - password do zip into 1. text like 1. TT
129:08 - I want to zip into this particular file
129:11 - password do zip I will use hyphen e
129:15 - option and here it will ask for me to
129:18 - enter the password which you want I will
129:20 - use something
129:23 - okay aush and here you can see adding
129:26 - one.txt stored in that particular zip
129:28 - file so where it is uh this one
129:31 - password.
129:33 - okay let me open it
129:36 - uh yeah and now here 1. TT like has you
129:40 - can see here log type also like uh it
129:43 - will me like prompt me to enter the
129:46 - password now I will enter
129:50 - and here you can see 1.txt has been
129:53 - unlocked as there is nothing so it's
129:54 - showing like nothing here okay we have
129:57 - not written anything in that 1tt file
130:00 - okay so uh that's all for today uh I
130:03 - hope you got it how you can zip files uh
130:06 - and also how you can zip multiple files
130:08 - together in a single file with the
130:10 - hyphen e option like if you want to like
130:14 - protect uh or jip some sensitive files
130:16 - and you have to send it to some other
130:18 - person you don't want to disclose that
130:20 - particular file so you can easy use Hy
130:22 - option also in that
130:23 - case so that's all for and now in this
130:26 - video we will start with the most uh
130:28 - basic command that is unip command Okay
130:31 - so uh first how we will start uh I will
130:34 - create a one
130:36 - directory that is uh sorry mkd
130:41 - zip and I will move into that particular
130:44 - directory and I will create some files
130:47 - 1. TT
130:49 - t uh sorry 2.txt
130:53 - 3.txt okay now these three files has
130:56 - been created now what I like to do I
130:58 - want to zip all these three files in
131:03 - uh one
131:05 - particular zip file okay so 1. 2xt 2.txt
131:12 - 3. T3 and I want to zip all these in a
131:15 - single file that is
131:18 - files.zip
131:20 - okay all has been added I will do LS
131:23 - here you can see files.zip and for your
131:26 - reference I will open up this directory
131:27 - and here you can see all these files and
131:30 - Z files are there in the in this
131:32 - directory so now in this particular we
131:34 - are going to study about uh unip how you
131:37 - can unip these particular files and
131:40 - particular zip files okay so the most
131:43 - basic and um simple uh like uh command
131:48 - that is unzip we used to like extract
131:52 - files of this particular zip file so how
131:55 - we can do it we will just use unzip and
131:57 - the particular file
131:58 - name
132:01 - sorry and here you can see it is asking
132:03 - me for do you want to replace or not
132:05 - okay so I will just hit control C right
132:09 - now okay uh because I don't want to
132:12 - create any confusion for you guys first
132:15 - what I will do I will just create all uh
132:17 - remove all this 1 do txt 2.txt and 3.txt
132:21 - files I have now deleted all these files
132:24 - now what now I will use unzip and the
132:28 - files.zip and it will simply like
132:30 - extract all the files which are present
132:32 - in this files.zip for your reference let
132:35 - me open it so you can see what are the
132:38 - files is present so here you can see
132:40 - these are the three files which are
132:41 - present in this particular zip file so I
132:44 - will hit this command and done we have
132:47 - simply extracted all the files of that
132:49 - particular files. Z file okay so this is
132:52 - a very simple way to extract files and
132:56 - now moving forward uh suppose like uh
132:59 - you want your these files and these
133:02 - 1.2.3 do text in some kind of another
133:04 - locations uh suppose in many cases you
133:06 - want to store these files in some other
133:08 - directories okay so uh how you can do it
133:12 - uh without like um extracting all these
133:16 - files in the same directory in which
133:17 - your files. jip so but you can extract
133:21 - this file in some other directories also
133:22 - so how you can do it this is very simple
133:24 - now what I will do uh I will open up a
133:27 - new terminal
133:28 - or okay let me open up a new
133:38 - terminal uh let me increase a little bit
133:40 - of font size for you and uh I will
133:45 - create
133:46 - uh one folder that extracted files okay
133:52 - I move into this folder and I will copy
133:54 - the whole path that is home iuse
133:56 - extracted
133:58 - files
134:00 - okay in uh uh this uh terminal you can
134:04 - copy by control shift C okay I will just
134:08 - move it here now what if you want to
134:12 - like unzip files in some particular
134:14 - directory so for this we use basically
134:17 - hyphen option okay in this we will
134:20 - provide the path of that
134:25 - particular particular directory where
134:27 - you want to store that particular uh
134:30 - extracted files so unzip and then the
134:33 - file name which you want that is files.
134:35 - Chip and hyund d and then control shift
134:37 - V and here we want our files in this
134:41 - extracted files directory okay now what
134:46 - we will do here I will do just list in
134:48 - this particular terminal and here you
134:49 - can see all of these files has been like
134:53 - uh extracted in this particular
134:55 - directory so in this way also like you
134:57 - can uh store your uh instructor file in
135:00 - some kind of another directory okay so
135:03 - this is another simple trick uh like uh
135:07 - which uh uh you should know about it and
135:10 - also there are many options like uh
135:13 - suppose in case what happens you have
135:16 - extracted your files uh uh Z file
135:19 - already but uh sometimes also what
135:21 - happens uh you accidentally click on it
135:24 - so in this case in Linux what happens
135:26 - when you try to like unj files and uh in
135:30 - the same directory or you can say in
135:33 - another so here you can see we have
135:35 - already these files 1 2 3.txt what what
135:40 - what will happen when I will try to hit
135:42 - the same command again so it will ask me
135:44 - for do you want to overwrite these files
135:46 - or none or nothing or else okay I said
135:49 - uh I will say yes
135:51 - okay and again it it is asking for 1.
135:54 - 2xt again I will say yes again for two.
135:57 - text and 3. text okay yes so again these
136:00 - all the files has been
136:03 - replaced okay in case if I would made
136:06 - any changes in this well then I will
136:08 - definitely choose no because I don't
136:11 - want to create any kind of problem for
136:13 - myself
136:15 - okay so uh like this is the basic uh
136:19 - options which we can use to unj files
136:21 - and also uh like you should know about
136:23 - one more option that is uh hyphen Q
136:26 - option what is it okay uh I Will Show
136:29 - You by uh first what I will do I will
136:31 - remove the all these one do and all
136:34 - these files from this
136:37 - directory
136:39 - okay so here you can see there's all the
136:41 - files what basically in simple case what
136:44 - happens when I do it will show me me
136:47 - these messages okay extracting these
136:50 - files extracting 2.txt extracting 3.txt
136:53 - uh in some cases we we don't want this
136:56 - kind of information because we know it
136:58 - will simply extract the files so for
137:00 - this what we can use we can use just uh
137:03 - hyphen Q
137:05 - option iph q and
137:08 - then file Store zip it will uh just
137:11 - avoid like it will not print any kind
137:13 - kind of extra things so uh for before
137:18 - hitting this command I will try to again
137:20 - remove all those files and
137:23 - now I will use hyphen qy
137:27 - option and done so in this case we
137:30 - didn't get any kind of information or
137:32 - any kind of message like whether this
137:34 - file has been extracted or not okay now
137:37 - again let me remove it and I will again
137:39 - tell you one more option that is hyphen
137:41 - L option basically if you are aware of
137:43 - Ls command so you will definitely know
137:45 - about higher LS High funel option which
137:48 - basically like list all the uh means
137:52 - list the files in a long format okay you
137:55 - can say like we get many kind of things
137:57 - like date time user guest not guest uh
138:00 - groups user groups access time modify
138:03 - time we get all those kind of
138:04 - information and simply uh you can say
138:06 - permissions also like we will have a
138:09 - separate lecture on permissions okay so
138:11 - now what we can do unip hyph L and again
138:14 - I will try to unip these files uh it is
138:17 - looking so much like U so much stuff
138:20 - there let me clear first in screen now
138:22 - again I will write HL and then file St
138:25 - zip and here you can see the more extra
138:28 - information about the extracted files
138:31 - you can see the length the length is
138:33 - zero and uh date time name all these
138:38 - things all these things okay so it
138:41 - basically doesn't extract but it simply
138:43 - shows you the whatever the files are
138:45 - present in the particular
138:48 - uh zip files
138:50 - okay so that's it for today now in this
138:53 - video we are going to cover the most
138:54 - important topic of the Linux series that
138:56 - is the permissions okay so uh in this
139:00 - video we will cover the concept which
139:01 - lies inside this particular topic and uh
139:04 - commands we will cover in the next video
139:06 - okay so basically uh let me tell you
139:09 - about the permissions I hope you may be
139:10 - aware of it uh but uh still let me tell
139:13 - you like um I will tell you with one of
139:16 - the example with the real life example
139:18 - uh suppose you have a PC and you are the
139:20 - administrator of that particular PC and
139:23 - you have some other users like your
139:24 - brother or you can or your sister okay
139:27 - and you have some kind of files okay
139:29 - which you don't want to show those files
139:30 - to that particular user particular your
139:32 - brother okay so in this case what you
139:34 - will do you will specify a particular
139:37 - permission to that file so that file
139:39 - should not visible or should not
139:42 - accessible to other user so in this way
139:46 - we can set permit missions to the files
139:49 - or directories or whatever you want so
139:52 - that should not be accessible to other
139:54 - users or other person okay or you want
139:57 - your profiles to like keep it secret or
140:00 - keep it private you can say so uh I will
140:03 - tell you with uh a diagram also so that
140:07 - uh it will be easy to understand for you
140:09 - guys so here you can see you uh here is
140:13 - the administrator that you
140:16 - okay
140:18 - and
140:22 - uh suppose uh here is your brother uh
140:27 - your brother okay or sister you can say
140:31 - and also you have some files also that
140:37 - is I will name it as a private
140:41 - files okay and
140:45 - uh this one
140:49 - and from this to
140:51 - this you have uh like uh you will have
140:55 - the
140:56 - access and your brother will not have
140:59 - the access for
141:01 - it not access okay so in this way you
141:06 - can understand like this is the private
141:08 - file okay you have the administrator you
141:10 - have the access for it but your brother
141:12 - or sister uh if they want to access this
141:15 - particular file they will get get the
141:17 - error like permission denied or
141:19 - something like that okay so in this way
141:21 - permission like uh you can get the
141:23 - scenario of the how permission work okay
141:27 - uh so now uh in our Linux operating
141:29 - system or you can
141:33 - saytu uh
141:35 - sorry I will show you the permissions
141:38 - okay
141:39 - so I hope you are aware of Lis command
141:42 - so this command basically doesn't so
141:44 - much information about uh the what are
141:47 - the the permission what is the size who
141:48 - is the user who is the group all these
141:51 - things it doesn't so but when we'll do
141:52 - LS iel then it basically like uh what we
141:56 - can say long listing description of the
141:58 - files and directories
142:01 - okay wait a
142:05 - minute so in this
142:08 - way here you can see there are multiple
142:10 - columns like you will think first like
142:12 - what are these things I'm not getting
142:14 - anything but here you can see like this
142:17 - is First Column is just for permissions
142:21 - next column is for this is the hard
142:23 - links which we will cover in other
142:24 - videos okay and this is the user who is
142:26 - the user who have access of that
142:29 - particular directory and who are the
142:31 - groups and this is the file size date
142:34 - modification date and time these things
142:36 - are there and this is obviously the
142:38 - directory name so right now in this
142:41 - video we don't have to focus on all
142:42 - these other columns like user group we
142:45 - will have a separate video when and at
142:47 - the time user creation all these things
142:49 - but now in this video we have to only
142:51 - focus on these particular things like
142:53 - only on the first colum what is the d r
142:57 - WXR WXR what are these things so we will
143:01 - cover now in this video
143:06 - okay
143:08 - so I hope you got
143:10 - it now what I will
143:16 - do
143:19 - increase the font size first let it be
143:23 - 18 not
143:26 - 18 uh 24
143:34 - yeah uh wait a
143:37 - minute yes first uh uh I will write the
143:41 - rwx
143:43 - okay again similar thing is we have to
143:46 - do
143:48 - R WX and R
143:53 - WX I will tell you one by one what is
143:55 - these things so basically R what is r r
143:59 - stands for
144:01 - read and
144:04 - uh we
144:10 - have W stands
144:12 - [Music]
144:13 - for
144:16 - right
144:17 - okay and uh x x stands
144:23 - for XC cute
144:29 - okay so these are the some like uh
144:33 - notations rwx is for the permission in
144:35 - our Linux operating system that is R
144:37 - stands for read it just means suppose
144:39 - you have a file and you want to give
144:41 - that file only the read access to some
144:43 - kind some other user similarly in kind
144:46 - of your brother sister okay suppose here
144:48 - is your like some documentation you have
144:52 - and you want to show it to your brother
144:55 - so you can give only the read permission
144:57 - to your brother to your other user like
144:59 - he can only read these files okay and
145:03 - what is the write permission suppose
145:04 - when you will give the read and write
145:06 - permission to this particular
145:07 - documentation file so in this case
145:09 - suppose uh uh they are in the same
145:12 - project with you so what will happen
145:15 - they can change these files also
145:17 - according to him and rwx is nothing but
145:20 - the read write execut it means you will
145:22 - give the all the permissions uh like
145:25 - execute permission we basically use for
145:26 - the some kind of scripts and all these
145:28 - things like when we will cover B
145:30 - scripting so you will get to know about
145:31 - this
145:32 - Dosh files and all or we can say Pi also
145:36 - for python files
145:38 - okay so these are the things uh for in
145:41 - the read write execute so I hope you got
145:44 - it what is read what is write what is
145:45 - execute so now here comes why I have
145:48 - written these 3 three three so here is
145:50 - the reason behind it the first section
145:53 - is only for the user the user uh whoever
145:58 - is the user they will have the like
146:00 - these permission right now they have R
146:02 - execute all these three
146:03 - permissions okay and next is for
146:09 - group
146:12 - okay and uh next is for
146:17 - uh wait a
146:22 - minute next is for
146:24 - home other or you can say some other
146:28 - books or some other on net you can get
146:32 - like other world or anything else like
146:36 - okay so uh these are the uh three three
146:39 - permission total nine nine permission we
146:41 - have three for user other three for
146:44 - group and other three for other like
146:47 - other world okay so here you can see in
146:49 - our system uh I will make a directory so
146:54 - it will be visible to
146:57 - you and I will try
147:00 - to uh create One Directory test
147:05 - one and
147:10 - uh touch file.txt LS Okay so like here
147:17 - you can see I have created two files
147:19 - like uh with when you will apply this uh
147:21 - semicolon then you can write multiple
147:23 - commands in one single line okay I hope
147:25 - you you got to learn new things okay so
147:28 - now I will do uh LSI
147:31 - funnel so here you can see uh the file
147:35 - permissions for uh
147:37 - user and D is for directory and this
147:41 - hyphone is for only for the files okay
147:44 - there are some also other notations uh
147:46 - which will cover over in advance video
147:48 - okay when we will executing commands
147:51 - Okay so here you can see
147:54 - rwx rwx that is how much it uh 3 is6 and
147:59 - again
148:00 - rwx okay so here in place of w you can
148:05 - see that is hyphen means it means zero
148:07 - like uh that other user is not having
148:10 - any permission to write anything inside
148:13 - the directory okay and this rwx r me
148:17 - they the user and the group have all the
148:20 - permissions okay I hope you got it so
148:26 - uh now what we have to do uh now I will
148:29 - tell you about some kind of like uh you
148:33 - can see numeric representation like how
148:35 - we can represent the uh what we can say
148:39 - um permissions of this so basically what
148:42 - happens this is in this uh
148:47 - wait a
148:48 - minute for R we basically give a number
148:52 - that is uh
148:53 - read wait a minute I will write here
148:59 - only here for R we give particular
149:02 - number that is four
149:05 - okay and for
149:09 - uh right we give it
149:12 - two and for one we give it
149:17 - for execute we give it one so overall
149:20 - when you will add all these numbers so
149:22 - for all suppose if you want to give all
149:25 - the permission to some kind of file so
149:28 - in this case you will provide this
149:32 - 777 okay it means you are providing
149:37 - seven for user also seven for group also
149:43 - other seven for other also
149:47 - and suppose uh and also one more is
149:50 - remaining that is
149:52 - zero what is zero 0 is nothing for no
149:56 - permission okay if you will uh give it
149:59 - zero to some other like
150:02 - uh for any case you will give it a zero
150:05 - then
150:08 - um they will not have any kind of
150:10 - permissions okay now Suppose there is a
150:14 - file that is uh suppose this
150:16 - documentation file I want to give this
150:19 - uh as a
150:21 - only uh read and write permission to the
150:25 - no rewrite execute permission to the
150:28 - user so in case of user I will write
150:32 - four + 2 + 1 that is I will write Seven
150:36 - Fold user
150:39 - okay and similarly for uh
150:44 - group what uh for group I just want to
150:47 - give them only what we can say uh write
150:52 - permissions okay so I will just give it
150:55 - them
150:57 - two okay it basically means 0 + 2 plus 0
151:03 - like it will automatically like uh
151:05 - accept like uh that particular group has
151:08 - only right permissions
151:12 - okay and for other users suppose uh you
151:17 - want to give it as
151:19 - uh for other I want to give them as six
151:23 - like 4 + 2 + 0 so they will only have to
151:27 - read and
151:28 - write permissions
151:32 - okay so overall what we will write we
151:36 - will write
151:38 - 72 72
151:41 - and six
151:45 - okay
151:48 - uh right now I don't have Mouse with me
151:50 - so I'm getting this problem
151:53 - okay so now so to give the permission to
151:57 - like uh for user you want to give them
152:00 - all the permission so we you can give it
152:02 - simply as seven for group suppose you
152:05 - want to give only the right permission
152:06 - you can give it two or suppose you want
152:09 - to give other all like only uh read and
152:13 - write permission so you can give it 4 +
152:14 - 2 that is six so the overall like uh
152:18 - number which you will provide in the CH
152:21 - mode command that is
152:23 - the uh
152:25 - 726 so what uh when you don't want to
152:28 - give any permission to the other user so
152:31 - in this case you can give it them as a
152:33 - zero suppose uh the same scenario like
152:36 - you want to give group as two so what
152:38 - you can do that is 7 to0
152:41 - simple so uh I hope you got it the
152:43 - concept of read write execute and how
152:46 - this is divided like rwx rwx rwx what is
152:50 - these three like we
152:53 - have like a separate permission for Rite
152:57 - execute for one user then for group for
153:00 - other and also I hope you got this
153:02 - representation of numeric
153:05 - okay in binary also we can represent
153:08 - like for four I think we
153:10 - represent uh
153:12 - 1 and yeah let me write it for binary
153:22 - also so for binary we write 1 0 and uh
153:27 - for four for two I think we write uh uh
153:31 - it's uh 0 one0 it may be uh I hope I'm
153:37 - correct uh wait a
153:42 - minute so for two what we write uh 0 1 0
153:47 - and the 4 one uh it's I think
153:51 - 01 it should
153:53 - be 0 0 1 okay so uh let me check it once
154:00 - also I don't want to like share wrong
154:02 - information with you guys uh for in
154:08 - binary it's one0
154:15 - okay
154:16 - yeah here you can see 1 0 and for two it
154:20 - should be 0 1 0 yeah 0 1 0 is
154:25 - there
154:27 - uh we can get like 0 1 0 is there and
154:30 - for one we will
154:33 - get yeah it's user one okay so this is
154:37 - correct so in binary also you got to
154:39 - learn about how we can write in the
154:41 - binary
154:42 - also so uh that's all for today's video
154:44 - I hope you liked and now this video we
154:46 - are going to cover the one command that
154:48 - is the change mode or you can say CH
154:51 - mode also uh basically this command is
154:53 - used to change the permissions so this
154:55 - thing we have covered in our last video
154:58 - okay so now uh particular CH mode is one
155:02 - of the command that we basically use to
155:03 - change the permissions of the certain
155:06 - files or directory you can say okay if
155:09 - you don't want to provide uh permission
155:11 - to any user or uh any groups or anything
155:15 - any other user whom you don't want to
155:17 - provide access or want to provide access
155:20 - then you can use this particular command
155:22 - okay so now in this video uh first of
155:25 - all let me increase the size so it will
155:27 - be visible to you so now what we have to
155:29 - do I will create one directory that is
155:33 - um uh access dni like
155:42 - this now what I have to do I will create
155:45 - uh two fold fers or you can see director
155:49 - also secret
155:52 - one sec create
155:55 - to and one file that
156:02 - is private. txt
156:06 - okay now you can see I have done LS so
156:10 - these are all the files or directory
156:12 - which we upgraded now when I will do
156:14 - high high funel so you can get these
156:16 - information of the long format in the
156:18 - long format okay so I hope you are aware
156:20 - of this what is
156:22 - drwx uh okay and what is this hyphone I
156:26 - hope you but let me tell you one more
156:28 - time like what are these things so
156:30 - basically hyphone is for files are this
156:32 - for read so if we will provide read
156:35 - permission then you can read that file
156:37 - then if you provide WR then you can
156:39 - write that if you Pro execute then that
156:41 - file will be executable
156:44 - Okay so for uh for like in depth
156:48 - information you can watch our previous
156:49 - video on the permissions okay so now
156:52 - what we have to do
156:54 - uh today in this video what we will go
156:57 - uh going to do like we will change the
156:59 - permissions of certain files or
157:01 - directories okay so now uh the command
157:04 - which I was talking about that is CH
157:06 - mode it basically stands for change mode
157:09 - okay change mode of what files or
157:11 - directories so uh we have learned
157:13 - already learned the uh like two
157:17 - representations of this uh permissions
157:20 - like one is a uh numerical and one is
157:23 - alphabetical like when you will do rwx
157:26 - it is alphabetical and 421 is for what
157:30 - numerical
157:32 - okay so now what I will do I will first
157:36 - uh clear the screen unless I so now you
157:40 - can see the file permission of this
157:42 - private. txt so this uh uh is file and
157:47 - this is this like file has not any
157:51 - executable permission of this of the
157:53 - user or any other like on group also and
157:58 - for others it has only read permission
158:01 - okay so now what I have to do I will try
158:05 - to add uh executable permissions to this
158:09 - particular
158:11 - file okay so how can I do it so the most
158:16 - and simple approach is CH
158:21 - mode plus plus means basically when you
158:24 - want to add permissions to each and
158:28 - every like user group and others so then
158:32 - we will use plus so now what we have to
158:33 - do I have to use x like I have to add
158:37 - executable permission to this
158:39 - file then file name then enter now again
158:43 - I will try to check the permission so
158:45 - here you can see in users also
158:48 - executables has been added in groups
158:50 - also executables has been added and
158:53 - in what we say in others also
158:56 - executables has been added so this is
158:59 - the most basic approach for adding uh
159:02 - permissions in some files or directories
159:05 - and here you can see uh the color has
159:07 - been also changed because it has now the
159:09 - executable permission that's why color
159:11 - has been changed from normal to Green
159:16 - okay so uh what if you want to remove
159:20 - permissions okay so there is also way
159:23 - for it if I want to remove permissions
159:26 - like uh executable okay so what I will
159:29 - do minus x minus y minus B because we
159:33 - use minus to remove the permissions now
159:37 - again you can give the file name that is
159:39 - private. text again same thing I'll
159:41 - repeat LS ionl and here you can see
159:44 - executable permission has been removed
159:46 - from the user also group also and others
159:49 - also okay so this is the simple basic
159:53 - approach what if you want to
159:55 - remove like uh what we can say all the
160:00 - permissions so if I will do CH mode
160:04 - minus
160:06 - RW private.
160:10 - txt now here you can see all the
160:13 - permissions has been removed from this
160:15 - private TT like uh user has also no any
160:19 - permission or whether the groups has
160:23 - also not not any permission and others
160:25 - also have has not any permission so now
160:29 - what will happen I will try to access
160:31 - this
160:32 - file so let's see what
160:35 - happens here you can see permission is
160:37 - denied why it's showing this error
160:40 - because the read permission like we have
160:43 - removed the all the permissions so
160:45 - simultaneous read permission has also be
160:47 - removed okay so what I if I will add
160:51 - only the read permission okay what will
160:53 - happen
160:57 - now CH mode plus
161:01 - read then file
161:04 - name again I will do LS I funel and here
161:07 - you will see the read permission has
161:09 - been added to all the groups now what I
161:11 - will do I will try to access this file
161:14 - private. txt
161:16 - and here you can see uh but here nothing
161:19 - is written that's why it's showing like
161:21 - nothing is has been printed but uh now
161:24 - you can see we can access this but here
161:27 - also you can see the write permission is
161:29 - not there so what if I will try to write
161:31 - some kind of files some kind of thing or
161:34 - text in this fil then let's see what
161:36 - happens whether we are able to write or
161:38 - not so here you can see permission
161:40 - denied why because you don't have right
161:43 - permission to change uh uh to change
161:46 - anything in this particular
161:48 - file okay so uh I hope you got it like
161:53 - how this uh like we can remove
161:56 - permissions we can add permissions then
161:58 - how we can remove certain permissions uh
162:01 - together or add or remove okay like we
162:04 - did here like we we remove two
162:07 - permissions together in this case hyph
162:09 - RW
162:11 - okay so uh this approach is basically
162:14 - applies for if you want to apply certain
162:17 - permission for all the like for all
162:21 - these three like for the users also for
162:24 - the groups also and for the this one
162:27 - others also what if you want to apply
162:31 - permissions to only user okay so how
162:35 - will you do it okay so in this case what
162:39 - will happen how you can do
162:42 - it like uh let me clear the screen
162:46 - LS I funel okay now what I want to do I
162:49 - want to give the read uh sorry write
162:51 - permission to only the user okay so how
162:55 - I can do it CH
162:58 - mode then for user we use you and equal
163:02 - to is used to like assign certain only a
163:06 - specified permission to that particular
163:09 - uh user group or other okay now I will
163:12 - use here W and then
163:16 - private.
163:18 - txt and here you can
163:21 - see W has been added okay but
163:27 - uh uh yeah but read permission has been
163:31 - demo but uh so basically what happens
163:33 - here in this case uh when you provide
163:35 - this uh U equal to W so it
163:40 - only like what we can say it only are
163:43 - like uh add that permission and whatever
163:47 - you have a default permission it will
163:49 - get removed okay so when we'll use equal
163:52 - so it will just replace or you can say
163:54 - it will remove the other permission and
163:56 - it will add this new one okay so now
164:00 - what I have to
164:02 - do I will to uh like add re read
164:06 - permission again in
164:07 - this user so how I can do it CH mode U
164:14 - Plus read okay private.
164:18 - txd so here you can see we have added
164:21 - read permission as well in this
164:23 - particular file what if you want to give
164:27 - uh like
164:29 - uh write permission to this one to
164:33 - others uh two groups also for for groups
164:35 - there is a notation of uh what we can
164:38 - say G
164:41 - okay and again L if you do you can see
164:45 - right permission has been added and for
164:48 - others we use
164:53 - o again LSL and here you can see the
164:58 - right permission has been added in this
165:00 - private do txt file okay so in this way
165:05 - uh you can add remove permission for
165:07 - users for groups uh or for others
165:11 - okay so this is basically for the like
165:15 - what we can say uh alphabetical notation
165:19 - okay but uh but uh numerical notation is
165:23 - I think it's good to use like it is easy
165:27 - also you can easily understand but if
165:29 - you're bner you will think like yeah
165:31 - this is a easy so so now what I have to
165:35 - do I have I will remove all the
165:38 - permissions from this
165:40 - uh what F can say private. txt file so
165:45 - so CH
165:51 - mode minus RW from all it will remove
165:54 - the from all
165:57 - the
165:59 - okay new permissions are W minus
166:06 - uh
166:08 - okay uh let me try to remove like this
166:11 - like a equal
166:14 - to
166:15 - or 0 0 I can
166:20 - give yeah so now here you can see all
166:23 - the permiss has been removed why 0 I
166:26 - will tell you uh in a little bit now so
166:30 - now what we have to
166:33 - do we will add permissions in this
166:36 - particular file using the octal notation
166:38 - of
166:40 - the like this OCT notation of what we
166:43 - can say
166:45 - permission so uh uh let me uh like uh
166:49 - tell you those things again so that will
166:51 - be helpful for you so for octal notation
166:54 - what happens we use R = to 4
166:59 - okay and
167:01 - uh we use uh
167:05 - WR
167:07 - to and execute equal to one okay so if
167:11 - you want to give the
167:15 - what means all permissions okay like
167:18 - read write execute to particular user or
167:21 - particular group or
167:23 - particular other okay so what you will
167:27 - need to do you will need to give it as a
167:30 - seven like you want to give four also
167:33 - you want to give two also you want to
167:35 - give X
167:36 - also okay so overall it is seven so let
167:40 - me tell you with an example so that will
167:42 - be easy to understand okay so now now
167:45 - what I will do CH mode
167:48 - 777 this seven is for first seven is for
167:52 - user second seven is for group and this
167:55 - third seven is for others so if I will
167:57 - do 777 it will give all the permission
168:00 - to all those user group and others and
168:05 - now I will do this hyph and and here you
168:07 - can see all the permission has been
168:09 - added to that particular private. txt
168:11 - file so now I will do some kind of
168:14 - changes I will again remove all the
168:16 - permission by applying 0 0 to all
168:20 - those
168:24 - okay so here I have removed all those
168:27 - permissions so now in this case what I
168:28 - have to do I have to only give the read
168:31 - permission okay uh let me open a text
168:34 - file for you uh or another terminal I
168:38 - will
168:43 - open
168:50 - so for R what we have four for write
168:54 - what we have two for execute what we
168:56 - have one so in this case what I want to
168:59 - give the user only I want to give them
169:02 - read and write okay so for user I will
169:06 - just write six okay and I want to give
169:10 - the group only right permission so two
169:13 - and I don't want any kind of permission
169:15 - to others so I will give it there as
169:17 - zero okay and then F
169:20 - name so now here you can see we have
169:23 - only read write permission to this user
169:27 - only write permission to the group and
169:30 - there is no any permission to the what
169:33 - we can say uh others okay so uh in this
169:38 - I hope you got it like how you can uh
169:40 - change the permission based on this OCT
169:42 - number I hope you got it like we have
169:44 - covered this in the last video okay so R
169:46 - = to 42 1 that is 7 if it is s then it
169:49 - will give you the all the permissions
169:53 - did that execute together
169:55 - okay now what if you want to
169:59 - uh give permissions like
170:03 - uh what you can say suppose if you want
170:07 - to change permission uh from read write
170:10 - for user I will just give them as a one
170:14 - let's see what
170:17 - happens so here you can see only like
170:22 - what you can say others has been added
170:26 - execute okay not anyone else okay so
170:29 - this is a happening I think because of
170:32 - we have provided only one one means uh
170:35 - there is not three values so now what we
170:38 - will
170:41 - do I will provide one to everyone let's
170:44 - see what happens you will see you have
170:47 - to only play with it when you will not
170:49 - play then you will not learn anything
170:51 - okay so that's all depends upon you so
170:54 - here you can see if I provided one to
170:56 - everyone so only execute permission has
170:58 - been added to all of
170:59 - them okay and if I provide
171:04 - two
171:07 - so let's see what
171:10 - happens only right permission has been
171:13 - added okay
171:15 - okay so I hope you got it uh let let me
171:18 - provide uh like uh for user I will
171:22 - provide only
171:24 - execute for uh group I will provide uh
171:28 - write and execute that is three another
171:32 - zero what
171:34 - happens same execute WR execute and
171:38 - zero okay so I hope you got it like
171:42 - uh how you can uh do or change the
171:45 - permissions with the help of this octal
171:48 - numbers and all okay so uh that's all
171:51 - for today yeah One More Concept is
171:53 - remaining here like uh when I will
171:55 - realiz hyph L here you will sometimes
171:58 - get hyph uh not hyphone you will get
172:01 - instead of X you will get some kind
172:03 - sometime s so s is nothing but a set uid
172:06 - it basically means like when you would
172:08 - provide the file uh like uh with that
172:12 - permission so what will happen
172:15 - it will run that particular file on
172:17 - behalf of you okay so uh let me uh check
172:22 - about the
172:24 - password
172:33 - uh one minute let iPhone user
172:43 - bin okay so here you can see the S and
172:46 - here who is the user root is the user
172:49 - and also here is root is the user I hope
172:51 - you know about the root user like this
172:54 - is the main user if if you are not able
172:56 - to run any F you don't have any then we
172:59 - you can use the root user to run run
173:02 - those file so here what happens this is
173:05 - the password is one of the command to
173:06 - change the uh password of your uh PC
173:10 - okay or your this machine so basically
173:13 - what happens when we run this password
173:15 - command so we basically run this
173:17 - password command on behalf of whom on
173:19 - behalf of this root user that's why we
173:22 - have given it them as a s permission
173:24 - that is a set uid permission okay what
173:27 - will happen when you will run this
173:29 - password command okay so what
173:33 - happens it will like say you changing
173:37 - password for I okay so I don't have to
173:39 - change right now so here what is
173:42 - happening this command is running on be
173:44 - of this root that's why we provide that
173:48 - as permission so this is basically a
173:50 - special permission you can learn more
173:51 - about this on the Google
173:53 - okay so I don't have to
173:57 - change okay I will
174:00 - just close the terminal that's all so I
174:04 - have you got it like how you can do with
174:06 - the octal representation with the uh
174:09 - alphabetical notation so that's all for
174:11 - today we are going to cover the most
174:13 - important topic of how this Linux series
174:15 - that is the user creation okay so
174:18 - basically in this video we are going to
174:19 - cover the how you can create users what
174:22 - are the files affected by you by
174:24 - creating that particular user and how
174:26 - you can create what are the root user
174:28 - sudo command and we are going to cover
174:31 - many things in this particular video
174:32 - okay so before moving forward uh I just
174:36 - want to discuss about a b a b a very
174:39 - basic thing that is what are the users
174:41 - okay I hope you you like U you're aware
174:45 - of it like if you're using this PC then
174:47 - you are the user if someone else is p
174:49 - using this particular PC and if he has
174:52 - or she has an account in this spe then
174:54 - he she or he is the user so basically
174:57 - what are the user users are nothing but
174:59 - you can say a particular person or
175:00 - particular entity what he can just like
175:04 - change the files and directories or he
175:07 - can do whatever he want uh
175:09 - okay so moving forward in this video uh
175:12 - I will uh like start with a very basic
175:15 - thing like uh categories or types of
175:19 - users in our Linux system okay so I hope
175:22 - this terminal visible to you okay I will
175:25 - just write right now I will just write
175:29 - things okay so the hash is basically
175:32 - just for comment okay so if whatever I
175:35 - will write it will like not execute as a
175:38 - command Okay so there are two types of
175:40 - user in all this Linux operating system
175:42 - that is one is root user or or you can
175:44 - say administrative user and other one is
175:47 - the normal user
175:49 - okay so what are the root users so if
175:53 - you're following this series then I
175:54 - don't think you are aware of the root
175:56 - user so but now we will cover it what is
175:59 - this so root user is basically that user
176:02 - who has access of the all the files in
176:04 - system like he he is just like
176:06 - administrator he can do anything he
176:08 - wants okay he has access of everything
176:11 - but what a normal user a normal user
176:13 - nothing but like like who doesn't have
176:15 - all the access okay so uh if you take uh
176:19 - like real life example suppose you are
176:22 - administrator of all this Windows PC or
176:25 - Linux PC anything
176:27 - okay and there is someone else who who
176:31 - has also access of this P but he is a
176:33 - normal user so uh I will just tell you
176:36 - like if you want to change the password
176:39 - of your of your account you can change
176:41 - it okay but if you want to change the
176:43 - password of or anything uh files uh of
176:47 - that other user then you can access it
176:49 - but that user cannot access the file of
176:52 - this particular what which user root
176:56 - user or administrative or administrator
176:59 - okay so basically the difference between
177:02 - uh in this is like normal user can't
177:04 - access the files of administrative user
177:07 - but in we can do it using the one of the
177:10 - functionality that is a pseudo command
177:12 - okay I will tell you what are the pseudo
177:14 - commands what is this how it works
177:17 - okay so this is all about the basics of
177:20 - difference between the root user and the
177:22 - normal user I hope you got it now moving
177:25 - forward uh now uh I will tell you about
177:28 - the studo command what is this okay but
177:31 - before it I will try to like uh cover
177:34 - one thing also the root user I will
177:37 - first set up the root user then I will
177:38 - tell you about the Pudo command what are
177:40 - the root users like I just discussed
177:42 - like he has access to all the per
177:44 - but by default in this obuntu root user
177:48 - doesn't work because it is disabled okay
177:51 - so to enable it what you can do you can
177:53 - just simply change the password because
177:55 - you know the root user is created you
177:57 - will just change the
177:58 - password
178:00 - okay so I will need sudo also because I
178:04 - I think it
178:05 - requires
178:07 - permission so the this pass WD is a
178:10 - command to change the user to change the
178:13 - password of any user so I'm changing the
178:17 - root here it is asking for my password
178:21 - and here I will try
178:24 - to add password of this root user okay
178:28 - so here we have successfully change the
178:30 - password of this root user so now to
178:34 - login as a root user what you can do you
178:36 - can change the switch user okay Su root
178:40 - means uh Su stands for switch user and
178:43 - root is there a username of that
178:45 - particular user and here I will type the
178:47 - password and here you can see the host
178:49 - name has been changed from iuse to the
178:52 - rout I will do LS here so that I have
178:55 - all the files I can see here if I will
178:57 - go to go back I will do LS here you can
178:59 - say test user has been created by me
179:02 - okay so that's all about it like root
179:06 - user now uh what I will do exit from
179:10 - this root user
179:12 - okay so we have created the root user
179:15 - and we have successfully set up the root
179:16 - user now moving forward the I was going
179:19 - to tell you about the pseudo command
179:20 - what is this Pudo Pudo what is the
179:22 - pseudo command like there is a boom of
179:24 - pseudo like if anything doesn't work
179:26 - then you will just apply pseudo and that
179:28 - thing will work okay so how it work
179:30 - basically that pseudo command is nothing
179:31 - but uh like um you can say how should I
179:35 - explain uh let me explain it by you an
179:38 - example suppose uh you have a file okay
179:41 - file.txt
179:42 - uh you you don't have access to it okay
179:45 - but if you want to access to it you can
179:47 - use the Pudo command to access it okay
179:49 - I'm just giving you an example so how it
179:53 - works basically uh Pudo command when you
179:56 - use it it will like uh it will work on
180:00 - behalf of the which
180:02 - user the root user okay the root user
180:07 - because root user has access to all the
180:10 - files okay so what you will do you will
180:13 - try TR
180:14 - to access that file on behalf of root
180:18 - user okay I hope you got it okay so but
180:22 - now there is a question like uh then
180:25 - every user like suppose I am this iush
180:28 - user I can access suppose I create some
180:31 - another user I us to then he can also
180:33 - access this particular administrative
180:35 - file but no the that's not a thing for
180:39 - this to work what you will need to do
180:41 - you will need to this I 2 into a sudo
180:43 - file that is some kind of file that is
180:45 - sers I think that that is the name I
180:48 - will goog it okay not remember I think
180:51 - this is the file sudo file it is there
180:54 - okay so in this file that particular
180:55 - user should be added or should be
180:57 - present to run sud sudo command okay so
181:02 - you will see all these things after when
181:04 - you will create a user and all these
181:06 - things you will see it everything okay
181:08 - so don't worry about
181:10 - it so I have you got it what is the
181:12 - pseudo command and all these things now
181:14 - moving on to the main topic of our this
181:17 - video is
181:18 - the user creation
181:21 - okay so before starting uh there are
181:24 - some Concepts which you should learn
181:27 - okay so I have already written it on
181:29 - this notion okay so the concept which
181:32 - you should learn the first and basic
181:35 - thing is uid what is the U ID U ID is
181:38 - nothing but uh user identification
181:41 - number you can say or user identifier
181:44 - so in Linux every user has their own
181:47 - unique ID okay so I will tell you my
181:49 - unique ID so if you will type ID and
181:54 - iush here you can see my U ID is 1,000
181:58 - and G ID is 1,000 this is the group ID
182:00 - and groups and all these things
182:03 - okay so uh now you have to focus only on
182:06 - this this part U ID so now my uid is
182:09 - what
182:10 - 1,000 okay if I want to change look at
182:13 - the root ID what are the what is the U
182:15 - ID of the
182:17 - root so this is only zero okay so that's
182:21 - thing I have written here like the
182:23 - ranges of uid is from 1 to
182:26 - 500 only for
182:32 - uh so here for system users uid ranges
182:35 - from 1 to 500 and for the other users it
182:38 - starts from 1,000 as in the Ubuntu and
182:41 - Fedora it starts from 1,000 1,000 but
182:45 - zero zero is reserved for which user
182:48 - root user or administrative user it is
182:50 - just the root is just the username okay
182:54 - so this is the concept of the uid okay
182:57 - so now what I will I'm going to tell you
183:00 - like U ID I you got it the ID is zero
183:03 - for the root user and 1,000 for the iush
183:05 - okay this is the ID which is generated
183:07 - for whatever user you will create it
183:10 - will get added by one and one okay
183:15 - so now the next concept is uh
183:18 - the where the details of user is stored
183:22 - okay so there are some kind of files
183:25 - which are getting infected when you
183:27 - create a user the most uh like uh usual
183:31 - or you can say important file that is s
183:34 - ITC passwd is one of the file and other
183:37 - file is uh Slash uh the
183:41 - ETC shadow
183:44 - s it is just a directory it's just their
183:47 - location where it exist okay so the P
183:51 - pass WD and Shadow file are the two file
183:53 - which get affected and also there are
183:54 - some other files so those we will not
183:58 - cover right now so these are the two
184:00 - files which getting affected
184:03 - okay so now if you will see the content
184:06 - of the/ ITC pass WD okay so what you
184:11 - will see wow I don't think you will
184:15 - understand anything right now okay let
184:17 - me clear this screen but before that let
184:19 - me tell you about this what is the
184:21 - password file or P WD files okay so in
184:24 - this file basically uh the information
184:28 - is stored about the user it means what
184:31 - information the U ID okay their group ID
184:36 - their uh name okay and other information
184:40 - and also some other information like
184:42 - Linux log Lo sell information are stored
184:45 - in this particular file okay so if I'll
184:47 - do c/ CC let me increase
184:52 - the okay so the first entry is of which
184:57 - user the first entry is of the root user
185:01 - okay and the second X is just for the
185:04 - password like here uh password doesn't
185:07 - like uh it uh like it doesn't display
185:10 - here password it is password is stored
185:12 - in another file that is a shadow file
185:14 - okay in the hash format type okay and
185:17 - then this is the group ID uh this U ID
185:20 - group ID their group user group and uh
185:24 - their home directory and the shell which
185:28 - they are using Okay pin bash so there is
185:30 - the like
185:33 - uh I break every part of that
185:37 - particular like uh thing like there are
185:41 - seven what yeah seven separators or you
185:44 - can say seven Concepts you can say okay
185:48 - in this particular file so here you can
185:50 - see uh Mark Mark is what username X is
185:55 - what password 1,1 is what uid again 1,1
186:01 - is what Z ID again here is the
186:04 - additional information okay and this is
186:07 - the home
186:09 - directory and this is the login shell so
186:13 - what is the login cell but before
186:16 - understanding the you need to understand
186:17 - what is cell cell is nothing but which
186:19 - provides you an interface okay to work
186:22 - okay you can understand and login cell
186:24 - is nothing but uh like whenever you log
186:27 - into the particular system then it
186:29 - starts working uh like you will learn
186:31 - about shell and Bash scripting or bash
186:34 - shell you will learn when we will start
186:36 - the bash scripting concept okay so there
186:40 - are also some other sales you can see uh
186:42 - like gnu cell cons shell jet shell okay
186:48 - so now what uh I going to do I will
186:51 - create a one user okay but before that
186:54 - yeah One More Concept is remaining here
186:56 - like SL CC Shadow okay uh we will
187:00 - uh come back on this point later on
187:02 - after creating user and also yeah here
187:05 - you can see my the first user that is
187:07 - aush and 1,000 is their uid GID and this
187:11 - is group addition
187:13 - info
187:15 - [Music]
187:16 - okay so now what I have to
187:19 - do I'll clear the screen and I will
187:23 - going to add uh some users in this
187:28 - particular video
187:31 - or so I will use sudo command why sudo
187:34 - because user add command uh like does
187:37 - not work directly you can try so if I
187:40 - will do user that it will give me the
187:42 - all the options but also if I will try
187:44 - to add user some kind of thing like
187:47 - some you can say which
187:53 - user test 22 so here you can see
187:56 - permission denied why permission dened
187:58 - because you don't have access to run
188:01 - this user add command because only root
188:03 - can add user so now what we will do we
188:05 - are going to add user on behalf of the
188:07 - root account okay that's why we will use
188:09 - pseudo now now I think you got the main
188:12 - concept of this sudo
188:15 - sud sudo user ad I will uh write some
188:18 - good name let's take uh
188:21 - mik no V Let's Take vat okay and uh sudo
188:27 - user add vat just uh this is the
188:30 - username now I will hit enter and the
188:33 - user has been created now to look at the
188:36 - file whether user has been created or
188:38 - not what I will
188:41 - do I will open up an another
188:44 - [Music]
188:46 - terminal okay and I will just read the
188:50 - password
188:51 - file and here you can see V user has
188:55 - been created and we still have not saved
188:58 - the password okay and the U ID has been
189:00 - given to that particular user 1,002 and
189:04 - another uh group ID has been given to
189:06 - 1,002 and this is the home we has been
189:09 - created but using user add command it
189:12 - does not reflect let's check whether it
189:15 - reflects or
189:16 - not if I do LS here you can see vat
189:19 - directory has not be created I will tell
189:21 - you everything how you can do it using
189:23 - user add command okay and the shell
189:25 - which are being used by this is being sh
189:29 - okay so uh like in this way you can
189:33 - simply like
189:35 - uh add user in know in your system now
189:39 - to change the password or assign the
189:41 - password what you will need to do
189:47 - the password command you will use sudo
189:49 - password
189:51 - vat password uh let's try same vat
189:55 - vat okay password updated successfully
189:58 - now the other file which come in roll in
190:02 - this uh user creation process that is
190:05 - Shadow file in Shadow file what happens
190:08 - like
190:09 - um all the passwords are stored in the
190:12 - hash format okay now uh let's take a
190:15 - look at the shadow
190:20 - file so you can see permission denied so
190:23 - what I can do I will just use sudo
190:24 - because now I will run this command as
190:26 - on behalf of the root user now it will
190:30 - ask you for the password just enter and
190:32 - here you can see
190:34 - vat
190:37 - okay so weat is there and this is the
190:40 - hash format of your password
190:44 - okay and uh next here is
190:48 - the when password created or password CH
190:51 - expired and or all things now let me
190:53 - open up this to simplify
190:55 - this uh yeah here you can see Mark
190:59 - dollar
191:00 - $6 this is the whole the like hash
191:04 - format encrypted password you can say
191:06 - and this is the when last password was
191:09 - changed then again their minimum
191:12 - password
191:14 - age and then maximum password Age Again
191:17 - warning period inactivity expiration
191:20 - unused all these things is like in this
191:23 - Shadow file you can get but we have not
191:25 - assigned any kind of those thing like
191:27 - expiry date all these things so that's
191:29 - why we are not able to say it so there
191:32 - are some uh encrypted password you can
191:34 - say what are the format like dollar type
191:36 - dollar short di dollar hash is the
191:38 - format to store your password so if it
191:41 - is one then it is MD 5 it is 2ay it is
191:43 - blow this is uh 2y uh e blow you can see
191:49 - all this thing if dollar 5 and 256 and
191:52 - 5002 now for dollar y it is yes script
191:55 - so it is also one of the method you can
191:57 - learn about
191:58 - it and now uh if you will learn about
192:02 - the last password change in this what
192:04 - happens it calculates from this state
192:07 - Jan 1 to
192:09 - 1970 okay and for expiry like it also
192:13 - like uh calculate from that particular
192:17 - day so I hope you got it the like what
192:20 - are the password file what are the
192:23 - shadow file if you want to take a
192:25 - screenshot you can take of this
192:27 - particular content so it will be helpful
192:29 - to understand you okay and for password
192:34 - you
192:35 - can this like you can take the
192:37 - screenshot of this particular

200:31 - done so now what you can
200:35 - [Music]
200:38 - do uh what you can do now yeah
200:43 - so uh you can see the multiple process
200:46 - we did in this like first we created
200:49 - user using user ad then we provided
200:53 - using hyph F option to create home
200:55 - directory then for uh shell we use hyph
200:59 - S option for comment we use hyphen C
201:02 - option and for uh and what else we used
201:07 - for U ID you used hyph U option okay so
201:11 - these these are the multiple option you
201:13 - are using the user add command so
201:15 - basically user add command is the
201:17 - lowlevel utility which means like it is
201:19 - earlier used but now it's there is also
201:21 - other utility that is add user that is a
201:24 - high level utility you can say okay so
201:28 - this is also useful because uh sometimes
201:30 - in kind of automation thing you need it
201:34 - okay or uh yeah but you should know this
201:38 - method also so now moving forward what
201:40 - I'm going to do
201:42 - and just uh let me uh like list all
201:49 - the so we are 2 3 4 has been greater 5 1
201:54 - okay so now what I'm going to do I am
201:56 - going to add a user using the simple
202:00 - command that is uh add user command okay
202:04 - so how you can do it sud
202:06 - sudo add user and the username which you
202:10 - want to give I just want to give as a
202:13 - search
202:15 - in
202:16 - okay what it is showing me please enter
202:19 - a username matching the regular
202:22 - expression
202:25 - configured iPhone for okay I think I
202:29 - need to write as a small case
202:31 - in yes so here you can see you can't use
202:35 - capital letter okay so here you can see
202:38 - adding user search in adding a new group
202:40 - search in here group is is also added I
202:43 - I didn't talk about group in this video
202:45 - I will talk about in the later video
202:47 - okay and then you have to here only you
202:50 - have to enter the password like uh such
202:54 - chin and again you have to enter the
202:57 - password and here if you want to give
203:00 - full name you can
203:02 - give
203:05 - chendul room number 1 2 3 work
203:09 - phone 789 456 6 1 2 3 oh sorry sorry
203:15 - sorry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 home number
203:21 - 0987654321
203:23 - other 09 8764 if you if you didn't enter
203:27 - anything it will be blank okay other is
203:29 - the information correct yes obviously
203:32 - why so now user hasn't created so this
203:38 - is a very simple command like in just
203:40 - one command you can create uh you can
203:42 - set the password you can add if any
203:44 - extra information you want to add okay
203:48 - so using this command you can simply do
203:50 - those things
203:52 - okay so if I will check the content of
203:56 - password so here you can see suchin one4
203:59 - has been idea assigned to suchin full
204:03 - name their phone number whatever it is
204:06 - room number home number and the
204:08 - directory directory has been also
204:10 - created let's check
204:13 - LS so here you can see suchin and now
204:16 - let's log in using
204:20 - suchin now you are here and
204:26 - uh if you will do LS so there is nothing
204:29 - any file so in this way also you can add
204:32 - users okay so that's all for today's
204:35 - video guys I hope you liked it and uh if
204:38 - you have yeah if you have any queries
204:39 - then please you can ask us in the
204:41 - comment section okay so that's all for
204:43 - today and we will meet in the next video
204:45 - with uh another concept so that's all so
204:48 - thank you thank you guys for watching
204:49 - this video and we'll meet in the next
204:51 - one thank you in this video we're going
204:53 - to talk about uh groups okay what are
204:56 - the groups in Linux operating system so
204:58 - basically as the name suggest you can
205:01 - think like a group as a like group of
205:03 - some kind of users group of politicians
205:05 - group of actors as this the name suggest
205:08 - but in in Linux we can create different
205:10 - kind of groups
205:12 - like we can create separate groups for
205:14 - developer for P for pentester uh
205:17 - different groups and for marketing team
205:19 - different groups so basically this is
205:22 - the basically mostly the use of groups
205:24 - like we can create different groups for
205:25 - different teams and we we can provide
205:27 - them the like different permissions
205:30 - according to their
205:31 - role so the there is a basic simple
205:34 - command inux like group AD okay using
205:37 - this command we can basically uh create
205:39 - groups in our operating system and I
205:42 - hope this is visible to you let me
205:43 - increase the size
205:45 - first it's too large let me need this
205:48 - yeah now it's
205:49 - fine so how you can do it uh the one
205:52 - command which I told you right now is
205:54 - group add and what you have to do you
205:56 - have to just provide the name of the
205:58 - group which you
205:59 - want so
206:02 - uh I will name it as
206:06 - a like uh
206:10 - developers okay so here you can see it
206:12 - is showing permission denied so one
206:14 - thing here also is like uh the group
206:17 - group add command is can be only
206:20 - performed by those users whether they
206:23 - are root or whether they have a certain
206:25 - permission of root permission or you can
206:27 - say whether they are in the sud file
206:31 - okay so in that file if any user in that
206:33 - particular file so they can easily uh
206:36 - use this particular uh feature of sudo
206:38 - command okay so I'm and that file like
206:42 - this user that J show what I will do I
206:45 - will just add sudo and it will ask me to
206:49 - enter the password done and we are done
206:53 - here you are not uh uh getting any kind
206:55 - of output or something but let me tell
206:58 - you one thing like when you create this
207:00 - uh uh or when you add this group AD
207:04 - command or you add different groups so
207:07 - at that time what happen there are the
207:09 - two files which gets affected when you
207:11 - hit this particular command one
207:16 - is uh one is group which are located in
207:20 - the/ CC directory and one another
207:25 - is SL Etc G
207:29 - Shadow okay so I will show you the
207:33 - content of
207:35 - uh group file okay like in Shadow file
207:39 - it basically contains the like when you
207:41 - create a group with password like they
207:44 - are not much required because uh like if
207:47 - there are multiple users then like uh
207:50 - your password will get uh like
207:52 - compromised you can think of of it
207:55 - okay so uh these are the two file which
207:58 - get affected when you whenever you
208:00 - create a group okay so let me show you
208:02 - the content of first c/
208:05 - CC like group
208:07 - file and here you can see see there are
208:10 - the multiple group
208:11 - here okay there are multiple groups the
208:14 - first group it may be root okay this is
208:16 - the root and these are the some system
208:18 - users and here in the last video we had
208:20 - covered about V 2 3 4 so whenever you
208:23 - add a new user then the separate groups
208:26 - is also created okay so right now what
208:29 - we have added we have added developers
208:31 - okay so developers is one of the group
208:34 - and X is for password and this is the
208:36 - group ID okay so let me show you the
208:39 - detail information about this particular
208:41 - file so that will
208:43 - be more clear for you guys okay so in
208:46 - this picture you can see like CD roome x
208:50 - 24 and this we these are the
208:54 - users but in our case users are not
208:57 - visible why because we have not still
208:59 - added users in our group so we will do
209:02 - this in our next video okay so in this
209:05 - particular video we will only create
209:07 - groups like we will see different
209:08 - options how you can do it and here you
209:10 - can see the like U detailed information
209:14 - about that particular file so here you
209:15 - can see CD CD is what just the name of
209:18 - your group like here you can see one
209:20 - indicates the group name like it is the
209:22 - name of the group if you run LS and this
209:24 - command you will see okay and then this
209:27 - is for password which we have not
209:29 - provided this is the G ID that is the
209:30 - group ID and the group list like who are
209:33 - the users present in this particular
209:37 - group I hope that is clear to you okay
209:40 - so so now what I will do uh I will try
209:43 - to create a group with uh some another
209:47 - GID okay so for this we can use the only
209:51 - one option is that that is hyph g option
209:54 - which will help you to
209:55 - create uh like um group with different
210:00 - GID okay so but before that I want to
210:03 - tell uh I want to show you one more
210:05 - option that is hyph f option what it
210:07 - does sorry
210:10 - basically
210:12 - uh when you want to create a group with
210:15 - the same name then let's see what
210:17 - happens okay so I'm going to enter the
210:19 - same command again let's see what
210:21 - happens here you can see group developer
210:24 - already exist but what if you want like
210:28 - if you don't want to see this error
210:29 - message or you want to forcefully create
210:32 - that particular like developer group so
210:35 - in this case you can use which option
210:37 - you can use
210:38 - just hyph F option hyph F just stand for
210:41 - forcefully okay or you can say Force so
210:44 - in this case what will happen I will hit
210:46 - enter and here again you can see same
210:50 - developer
210:52 - 152 okay so now in this now what I will
210:55 - do uh wait a
210:58 - minute why my screen is
211:06 - not
211:09 - okay
211:14 - okay so now what uh I will do I will try
211:17 - to create a group with some different G
211:19 - ID okay so how you can do it uh for this
211:22 - we have a hyphen G
211:23 - option group AD and still I will use
211:26 - hyphen f option because I don't want to
211:28 - create some other groups I just want to
211:30 - work on this particular developers group
211:33 - hyphen app then I will use hyph G and I
211:36 - will provide this
211:37 - 2000 let's provide it 2022 and the name
211:40 - is will still remain same that is
211:42 - developers and I have not added
211:44 - sudo it's more important with the help
211:48 - of sudo you can per anything
211:50 - Linux just hit enter and then again we
211:53 - will see the content and here you can
211:57 - see okay it uh our
212:00 - GID not added here okay let me
212:05 - check we have entered correct command or
212:08 - not oh yeah there is a hyph option is
212:13 - correct uh
212:15 - okay let's try
212:18 - to create different
212:21 - group
212:26 - testers okay so what happened like when
212:31 - we we were using hph option then in that
212:34 - case we cannot change this uh
212:37 - GID but uh with other uh when you will
212:40 - create new group then you can uh change
212:43 - like U this GID like you can create your
212:47 - uh you you can create like uh group with
212:50 - your own GID okay so like in this way
212:53 - you like you learn something new like
212:55 - you can't do like that if someone asks
212:57 - you to perform the same thing then you
212:59 - can easily say no it is not possible to
213:01 - change this
213:03 - GID using iph
213:06 - option so uh now what I will do uh there
213:09 - is also one command that we can use like
213:12 - uh like for getting the list of users
213:14 - what I'm typing I'm typing this cash /
213:16 - cc/ group okay but instead instead of
213:20 - this we can use the uh one command that
213:23 - is g tent and
213:28 - uh then
213:34 - group and here you will get get the list
213:37 - of all the groups which is present in
213:40 - our system
213:42 - okay and to delete the groups you can
213:44 - easily uh delete it using the group D
213:46 - command that is very simple that is what
213:48 - I will group tell and I will just uh
213:51 - pass the name of the group which you
213:53 - want to delete I want to delete
213:55 - testers and hit enter again permissioned
213:58 - why because we have not used sudo let's
214:00 - use
214:02 - sudo and then again get list of uh
214:06 - that get list where it
214:09 - is okay so here you can see tester has
214:12 - been removed so I hope you guys like
214:15 - learned about how we can add groups in
214:17 - our L system and but in our further
214:19 - video we will see like how we can add
214:21 - users in particular different groups
214:24 - like there is also a separate command
214:26 - for this task that is a user mod or you
214:28 - can say user modification also like
214:31 - there are many uh properties of this
214:33 - particular command we will learn all
214:35 - about this in the our next video okay so
214:37 - that's all for it and we'll meet in the
214:39 - next video so thank thank you thank you
214:41 - for watching and we'll meet in next one
214:43 - thank
214:44 - you this video we are going to cover the
214:47 - one command that is a user mode like as
214:49 - the name suggest it is the user
214:51 - modification command like with the help
214:53 - of this command you can modify the user
214:55 - details like their user ID you can
214:58 - modify their username you can modify or
215:00 - if you want to add those users into that
215:02 - particular group then you can also do it
215:04 - in this particular video so basically
215:07 - mainly we will focus like adding users
215:09 - into groups in this particular video in
215:11 - our next video we will try to cover the
215:13 - like uh extra things of whatever is the
215:16 - like user locking changing uh uid
215:18 - changing their uh what you can say uh
215:21 - their group name all these things we
215:23 - will cover in our next video so here is
215:26 - the scenario for you guys like uh there
215:28 - is a some kind of
215:29 - company and here you can see different
215:32 - teams are there like developer tester
215:35 - marketing team okay these are some kind
215:36 - of teams in that particular company and
215:39 - we have a different users like D1 D2 T1
215:42 - T2 M1 M2 so basically suppose this this
215:45 - is our uh some kind of Linux server and
215:48 - in which we want to create different
215:50 - groups so there will be separate groups
215:52 - for developer separate groups for tester
215:55 - and similarly for marketing team there
215:56 - will be a separate group and these are
215:58 - the users so now what we will do we will
216:00 - try to first of all create all these
216:02 - user uh all these groups then we will
216:05 - create users and then we will add these
216:07 - users into that groups using user mod
216:11 - command
216:13 - okay so now first what we will check if
216:16 - we have
216:19 - uh that uh group present or
216:24 - not uh I have
216:31 - sorry okay so here you can see uh there
216:34 - is no any other groups present like
216:37 - developers marketing team and all other
216:39 - groups okay so now what we can do we can
216:41 - try to add those groups so how we can do
216:44 - it you can do it easily by using group
216:46 - add
216:48 - command and I will try to uh give the U
216:52 - ID that is
216:54 - 2001 and the name of the group that will
216:56 - be
216:59 - developers okay so it is showing
217:01 - permission denied why because we have
217:02 - not added sudo here because it runs only
217:06 - uh if you have a
217:07 - permission like uh that user should be
217:10 - adding that sud file so now I will need
217:13 - to enter my
217:15 - password and again let's check if this
217:18 - group is added or not so here you can
217:20 - see developers group has been added okay
217:23 - and 2001 is the GID and we have not
217:26 - still added any kind of user into this
217:28 - group
217:30 - okay so now let's uh create uh other
217:39 - groups
217:43 - testers I will try to give uid is uh
217:46 - 2002 again permission
217:49 - denied okay
217:52 - added and now
217:55 - marketing
217:57 - team okay 2002 already exist change the
218:01 - uid to three
218:05 - okay so now what we can do we can check
218:07 - if all the groups has been created or
218:09 - not so here you can see developers
218:11 - tester marketing team has been created
218:14 - now what we have to do we have to create
218:15 - all these users like D1 D2 T1 T2 M1 M2
218:20 - okay but before creating group there is
218:23 - a one concept of primary and secondary
218:25 - group in our this Linux system so you
218:28 - will need to understand it first like
218:29 - basically what is primary group in
218:31 - primary group what happens when you
218:33 - create a one user or any new user so
218:36 - simultaneously one group is also created
218:38 - with them like suppose I have created a
218:40 - test okay a test user then test group
218:43 - will be also created okay so that is a
218:46 - primary group and what is a secondary
218:47 - group secondary group is nothing but uh
218:50 - like uh one user like will present in
218:53 - other groups also suppose this is a D1
218:57 - user and uh he has a primary group of D1
219:01 - and but he is also present in developer
219:03 - so developer is it what secondary group
219:06 - okay have you got it the concept of this
219:11 - okay so now what we can do I will add
219:14 - users so for users also we use Pudo
219:17 - command and we will use add user command
219:21 - not user add
219:24 - um name it as a
219:28 - D1 uh matching the regular expression
219:32 - okay so I think we cannot write num
219:34 - medical uh
219:37 - de one
219:41 - okay Sho add user day one is
219:45 - not okay let me
219:54 - check Okay add
220:01 - user that is sudo again I will try to
220:04 - create
220:09 - user
220:12 - oh
220:17 - sorry add user
220:21 - developer
220:23 - one okay so here you can see like
220:26 - developer one has been uh like uh
220:28 - username has been created now it is
220:30 - asking me to enter the password of that
220:32 - particular user so I will enter some
220:34 - kind like
220:36 - uh anything which I
220:39 - want and full name um I don't want to
220:44 - give and whether this information
220:46 - correct or not yes it is correct so this
220:49 - uh user has been created like to verify
220:51 - whether user has been created or not
220:53 - what you can do like as we have earlier
220:55 - learned like when whenever we create a
220:57 - user then the information is get stored
221:00 - or get added into the password file that
221:03 - is pass WD okay so we will check the
221:05 - content of that
221:08 - file sor sorry so here you can see our
221:13 - developer 1 has been created with the
221:14 - uid this and
221:16 - 101 GID what is z ID that is a group ID
221:19 - and this is uh his primary group okay so
221:24 - if you will check with the ID command of
221:26 - that particular user Dev developer one
221:30 - so here you can see their G is 101 and
221:32 - their primary group is developer one
221:35 - okay and groups in which groups uh this
221:37 - user is present so basically it is
221:39 - present in only one group that is a
221:40 - developer one because we have not added
221:43 - this user into that developers group so
221:45 - now what I will do again I will create
221:47 - another user um developer
221:53 - 2 okay let's enter
221:58 - password I don't want to provide yes
222:02 - done
222:05 - again now I will create for tester
222:08 - tester one
222:13 - same
222:20 - sorry why okay tester has been added now
222:24 - tester
222:29 - two no full name nothing required yes
222:33 - okay we have already covered this user
222:35 - creation you can watch our previous
222:37 - video okay so uh these two users has
222:40 - been added let's again check the content
222:42 - of that uh password file so here you can
222:44 - see developer 1 developer 2 tester one
222:47 - tester 2 has been added again last one
222:49 - is remaining that is which one marketing
222:51 - team okay
222:55 - so uh where that last command which we
222:58 - have run
223:00 - okay I will just write
223:03 - mty1
223:05 - password
223:08 - okay nothing is required yes again
223:13 - mt2 password uh enter anything which you
223:21 - want nothing required nothing and then
223:25 - yes okay so successfully we have created
223:27 - all these three users and the groups
223:29 - okay as per this scenario like developer
223:32 - has developer one developer two tester
223:34 - one tester two marketing team 1 and
223:38 - marketing team two okay so now we will
223:40 - check whether all these things has been
223:42 - created or not for your like
223:47 - clarification c/
223:51 - CC so here you can see all the six users
223:54 - has been created so now the main thing
223:56 - uh the main topic of our this video is
223:58 - user mod like user modification so now
224:02 - let's check the uh first of all check
224:04 - the like group of developer uh not
224:06 - developer let's check for tester
224:08 - one
224:10 - so here you can see G is this and group
224:13 - is this he is added only in this group
224:15 - particular and now let's check the like
224:17 - whatever the groups we have
224:23 - present so here you can see
224:27 - uh here one developers testers marketing
224:31 - team and also you can see developer one
224:34 - developer two this this this and why why
224:36 - this is happening because these are the
224:38 - primary groups for that particular user
224:40 - like when you have created that
224:42 - developer one user then simultaneously
224:44 - another group has been also created okay
224:46 - that's why this is a primary group now
224:49 - what we will do we will add this
224:50 - developer one user into this developers
224:52 - group and then we will check that uh
224:54 - like check with the ID command like uh
224:57 - um what are the other groups in which
224:59 - that particular user is present okay so
225:02 - now the role of user mod begins so let's
225:04 - start with this so basically uh user mod
225:07 - we will use it uh like this like user
225:10 - mode and then we will provide the name
225:12 - of the group in which we want and hyph a
225:16 - option hyph A is nothing for the append
225:19 - option okay I hope you are aware of
225:21 - append like appending something like uh
225:24 - uh Suppose there is a some kind of
225:26 - container and you are just appending
225:28 - into something things in it okay you can
225:31 - think of it like that and we will use
225:34 - hyph G option for the
225:37 - groups and the group name so what we
225:40 - want that is the
225:41 - developers I think this is the same name
225:45 - if I'm correct let me check
225:57 - it okay leave I'm correct I
226:02 - know
226:04 - uh developer
226:07 - one permission denied again because we
226:10 - have not used Pudo
226:13 - here and now let's check
226:16 - the groups of this particular user
226:19 - developer one so here you can see like
226:23 - uh G is 101 and the groups which in
226:26 - which groups this particular user is
226:28 - present so here you can see developer
226:30 - one this is his primary group and
226:32 - developers is his secondary group okay
226:36 - so again let's add other users also like
226:41 - uh developer 2 I will add this user into
226:46 - this developers uh what you can say
226:49 - developers group added simultaneously we
226:53 - will add uh uh users and testers
227:01 - group uh tester
227:08 - one
227:12 - I have written wrong
227:18 - name tester one
227:24 - okay added again for tester two added
227:30 - similarly for marketing team uh let me
227:33 - check the name of that
227:36 - uh particular group uh
227:44 - marketing team
227:45 - okay and here you can see like in
227:48 - developers we have you can see like
227:49 - developer one has been added and
227:51 - developer 2 has been added similarly in
227:53 - testers we have tester one and tester
227:55 - two okay so now what we will
228:01 - do we will add users into the marketing
228:06 - team let me clear the screen and and
228:09 - marketing team and uh username was mt1 I
228:14 - think mt1 okay added and similarly
228:19 - empty empty2 it was I
228:23 - think uh let me check the name of that
228:26 - particular
228:34 - user okay this is M2
228:38 - okay
228:43 - added so now again we will
228:50 - check so now here you can see the
228:53 - developers group like what are the users
228:55 - present that is developer one and
228:57 - developer two in similarly in tester
228:58 - group we have tester one and tester two
229:01 - and in our this uh what you can see in
229:04 - the marketing we have uh M M1 and M2
229:08 - okay so uh this is the like um thing
229:12 - which you should learn about like user
229:13 - modification like this is uh like what
229:16 - you can say important thing because uh
229:19 - when you will go in the corporate then
229:21 - maybe as a system engineer or whatever
229:23 - like Linux administrator then at that
229:25 - time you will get to know about this
229:27 - these things okay so uh that's all for
229:30 - this video and for user modification
229:32 - command like there will be another video
229:34 - for further details like how you can add
229:36 - the command add a uid and you can change
229:40 - the like old username to the new
229:42 - username so let me show you this command
229:45 - like how you can change it I have to
229:46 - change this M2 to M like marketing team
229:50 - 2 okay this is the user M2 and I have to
229:54 - change his username to marketing team
229:56 - too so how how I can do it I will just
229:58 - use user
230:00 - mod and then I will use the option hunel
230:03 - and the old username is M2 and the new
230:06 - username what I want is
230:08 - marketing team
230:11 - two okay user mod what is it showing
230:16 - user marketing team 2 does not exist why
230:19 - it not exist I'm
230:22 - just okay maybe the new name will come
230:25 - up
230:33 - here permission denied sud sudo okay
230:38 - again let's check the group name if it
230:40 - is changed
230:42 - so okay here you can see marketing two
230:45 - like from M2 to marketing to the name of
230:48 - the username has been changed and also
230:50 - you can verify it from this uh our
230:53 - password
230:56 - file here you can see it is marketing to
230:59 - okay so that's all for this video and in
231:02 - our next video we will cover up the
231:03 - other options of user mod command Okay
231:05 - so thank you thank you for watching and
231:07 - we'll meet in the next video thank you
231:10 - so basically we have already covered the
231:13 - how we can add users into another groups
231:15 - so now we will also like do some other
231:18 - operation like for this we will I will
231:20 - just create another user uh I will use
231:23 - the command add user using sud sudo and
231:26 - I will give it the name as a funny name
231:28 - Let's uh create with a hacker man uh
231:32 - sorry yeah new
231:34 - password
231:37 - hackerman hackerman I think yeah I have
231:40 - written correct I will not provide any
231:43 - kind of extra information just uh yes
231:46 - okay done so to check whether the user
231:48 - has been created or not what we do we
231:50 - check
231:52 - the this file that is hacker man has
231:54 - been created here you can see the with u
231:57 - id18 and G id18 okay so uh for login so
232:04 - how you can do it you can just switch
232:07 - uh user Su hackerman and the password
232:12 - hackerman so here you can see we are in
232:14 - this the hackerman directory okay so
232:17 - when you do LS so nothing you don't have
232:20 - permission LS okay here you can see all
232:23 - those kind of things log
232:26 - out I will use exit Okay exit we use it
232:31 - for uh like uh close that particular
232:34 - session of that particular user so now
232:37 - what we can do we we will just uh try to
232:40 - uh change the username of that uh not
232:43 - username uh I will add the first some
232:46 - kind of commments in that particular
232:47 - user so how you can do it user mode hyph
232:54 - C so here I will use hyph C option okay
232:58 - to provide some comments so let me
233:00 - provide like uh I a
233:03 - hacker okay and the name of that
233:06 - particular user hacker and I will use
233:08 - sudo like uh because we can't use
233:11 - normally this command okay so now let's
233:14 - uh check the sorry not I don't want to
233:17 - switch I need this one yeah so here you
233:20 - can see the comment has been added like
233:22 - I'm a hacker so in this way if you want
233:25 - to like uh add some kind of commments
233:28 - like in our previous video you can see
233:30 - like uh there is a developer section and
233:32 - if you want to add some comment to that
233:34 - particular user then you can add like
233:37 - this is first developer this is second
233:38 - deop veler or his ID is this his ID is
233:41 - this okay and kind of this kind of
233:42 - things you can
233:43 - do okay so now moving forward what we
233:46 - can do uh we can also change the uid
233:48 - what is uid uid is just the unique
233:50 - identifier number uh which you can
233:52 - change of any particular user which you
233:54 - want so how you can do it
233:56 - simple just provide
234:00 - uh hyphen which option U option and then
234:03 - U ID which you want so right now what it
234:05 - is one8 I will give it as two8 let's hit
234:10 - enter and again uh let's check this
234:13 - content of that particular file and it
234:14 - should be
234:16 - change yeah so here you can see 2008
234:19 - this is the U ID and what is this 1 this
234:21 - is the G ID okay but we have what
234:23 - changed we have changed the U ID okay so
234:28 - uh we have covered now hyphen c hyphen U
234:30 - now moving forward and uh if you want to
234:33 - change the username of this particular
234:35 - hackerman like from hacker man to if you
234:39 - want to change it like um best hacker
234:43 - like this like this kind of thing if you
234:44 - want to so how you can do it uh I will
234:48 - use again
234:49 - Theo user mode okay and I will use
234:53 - hyphen L option for changing the
234:56 - username hyph L and the new username
234:59 - which you want I want uh
235:04 - sorry uh I want uh best hacker
235:09 - okay I will hit enter and uh
235:14 - again check here so here you can see the
235:18 - name from hacker man to best hacker like
235:21 - it has been changed so in this way you
235:23 - can also change the uh like username of
235:27 - your um okay you can change the username
235:31 - of your particular user if you want okay
235:33 - and also the most like important thing
235:35 - is here you can use hyphen e option also
235:38 - okay okay uh Hy option what it will
235:41 - provide it will just add the like
235:43 - expired date like when that user should
235:45 - be get disabled so you can do it using
235:48 - the just one option that is the user
235:50 - mode hyphen e is stands for expiry and
235:53 - the particular date on which you want
235:57 - okay so today is uh 28 I will provide it
236:02 - as a 30 okay
236:05 - 30 no not in this I think year month and
236:08 - then
236:10 - 2022 and then month that is
236:14 - 8 and 30
236:18 - okay I will hit enter and the hacker man
236:20 - doesn't exist yeah because we have
236:22 - changed the name from hacker man to
236:24 - which best
236:26 - hacker best
236:29 - hacker done let's check whether it is
236:32 - reflecting or not it should okay but
236:35 - here it is not reflecting it reflects in
236:37 - I think shadow file
236:39 - okay so uh in this way you can also add
236:42 - the expiry date uh and uh one more like
236:45 - important command is that locking and
236:47 - unlocking of user account how you can do
236:49 - it in this so for this option we use the
236:52 - capital L option okay to lock a user so
236:55 - in this what happens like uh the that
236:58 - user can't log in using the username and
237:00 - password like but other methods are
237:02 - required like key based or switching
237:03 - user like which we did here earlier
237:07 - okay so to loog the user what we can do
237:10 - user mode
237:12 - hunel uh capital n and the best
237:15 - hacker permission denied why we have not
237:19 - used sudo H enter we have loged the user
237:21 - if I will try to not right now uh first
237:25 - of all I have to delete some users uh
237:28 - like I'm Linux marketing these all the
237:30 - users I want to delete uh how you can do
237:33 - it sud sudo user
237:36 - Dell uh I'm Linux
237:42 - marketing maybe I simultaneous if I um I
237:45 - don't know I can do or not
237:50 - mty1 tester
237:54 - 2 tester
237:57 - one
237:59 - developer
238:01 - one developer
238:07 - two okay okay but I don't think
238:12 - I'm succeed or not I don't
238:16 - think okay so no I am not uh like able
238:20 - to like uh delete that users like
238:23 - simultaneously okay so I will need to do
238:25 - one by one let me do it first because I
238:29 - have to just show you like I am not able
238:31 - to log in using the usern and password
238:33 - okay so user Del developer
238:37 - one
238:39 - again
238:41 - developer developer
238:44 - two again tester
238:50 - one tester
238:53 - two
238:56 - marketing what is the name of the user
238:58 - that
239:01 - mt1 done again it is marketing something
239:05 - marketing to done I am
239:07 - Linux
239:09 - I'm Linux done okay so we have deleted
239:13 - all the users like extra users which we
239:15 - had created earlier
239:19 - okay so now let me check the again that
239:22 - file okay so here you can see on the
239:24 - best hacker is there so now what I will
239:25 - do I will try to like uh
239:29 - uh switch user from here
239:35 - okay
239:37 - uh
239:39 - wait a minute it's like yeah not listed
239:44 - it's not swing yeah it is not showing
239:47 - okay so when we will unlock then we will
239:50 - try to check whether it is uh like
239:53 - visible or not that option of particular
239:56 - that user okay so I think if we have
239:59 - locked it that's why it's not visible to
240:01 - us okay so uh now to unlock the
240:05 - particular user what you can do you can
240:07 - you have to just use hyphen new Option
240:09 - okay but before that I will show you
240:11 - this one like if you are able to switch
240:14 - or
240:19 - not uh I don't think we
240:27 - are authentication failure
240:36 - okay okay Authentication phas will be
240:39 - there yeah I'm correct so now what if we
240:42 - have blocked the user now what we can do
240:44 - we will provide this hyph you option it
240:46 - will unlock the user okay so again let's
240:49 - check whether we are able to log in or
240:52 - not so now now we are able to login so
240:54 - when you will log the user you can't
240:56 - just uh login or anything for like using
241:00 - username and password okay so here also
241:03 - if we try to check whether the name of
241:06 - that particular user is available or not
241:09 - switch
241:13 - user just wait for a minute like it
241:16 - takes
241:17 - sometime so here you can see I am a
241:19 - hacker why it's sh because we have added
241:21 - that comment okay so it is showing okay
241:24 - but I'm still logging into my
241:28 - account oh I have added
241:31 - wrong
241:34 - done okay so uh that's all for this this
241:38 - video guys I hope you learned about like
241:40 - how you can uh edit the username add
241:43 - commments uh like editing username like
241:46 - mostly we want to edit okay and most and
241:50 - we will not use hyph l option like we
241:53 - don't want to lock anyone okay so uh you
241:56 - can do it or uh if you have guys any
241:59 - problem with this particular video or
242:01 - our previous video then you can ask us
242:02 - in our comment section okay so that's
242:04 - all for today and we will meet in the
242:06 - next video so thank you thank you for
242:07 - watching and if if you have not
242:08 - subscribed our Channel then please
242:09 - subscribe it guys okay thank
242:14 - you this video we're going to cover
242:16 - about uh head command Okay so head
242:19 - command is nothing but a simple command
242:20 - that we basically use to get the uh
242:23 - starting content of a particular txt
242:26 - file okay so uh when we will demonstrate
242:30 - and then you can easily get okay so let
242:33 - me open up the
242:36 - terminal I hope it is visible to you you
242:39 - okay I first create One Directory with
242:45 - head okay and I will create two files
242:51 - touch no I will create with cat command
242:54 - cat states.
242:57 - txt Okay and already I have entered the
243:01 - whatever the
243:02 - [Music]
243:04 - states okay I will just copy it here and
243:06 - I will paste it there okay
243:12 - enter control D to save and I will again
243:14 - create another command that is a
243:16 - capital.
243:21 - txt okay let
243:24 - me like this and again I will copy from
243:30 - this
243:35 - okay contr D Okay so so we have created
243:38 - two files you can check with the list
243:40 - command if I will try to read the first
243:43 - here you can see and if I try to read
243:45 - second file that is capital here you can
243:48 - see okay so now we will use the head
243:50 - command okay so what I just said you
243:52 - like what is a head command head command
243:53 - is nothing but which we use to print the
243:55 - starting content of a file so how we can
243:58 - get it to Simply the command is head and
244:02 - just provide the file name whatever it
244:04 - is st. Tex let's suppose okay and print
244:09 - uh I will hit enter and here you can see
244:11 - the first 10 lines you will get so by
244:14 - default what happens when you use the
244:15 - head common you get the first 10 lines
244:17 - of a txt file so you can count here also
244:20 - like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 okay so
244:25 - this is the one of the feature of the
244:27 - head command okay so if you want to like
244:30 - suppose you want to print only first two
244:32 - lines okay for this what you can do you
244:34 - have to nothing just provide the like u
244:37 - high and option how you can do it
244:40 - head hyphen hand 2 and
244:45 - states. txt so here you can see we have
244:48 - only just got the only first two lines
244:51 - if you want to print first five lines
244:53 - then also you can do it like
244:55 - from five
244:58 - okay so and what if you want to like uh
245:02 - get the content of two files
245:04 - simultaneously how you can do it so it's
245:06 - also a simple Comm of it is like
245:10 - head uh st. txt and what was other
245:14 - capital. txt hit enter so here you can
245:16 - see the first 10 contents of both the
245:19 - files
245:21 - okay
245:23 - so now what if you want to print only
245:26 - first
245:27 - five first five line of both the files
245:31 - so you can see here you can see 3 + 2 5
245:34 - 3 + 2 5 okay so here we are getting five
245:38 - lines and here also we are getting five
245:39 - lines so with the help of hyphone and
245:42 - option we can easily uh get the whatever
245:45 - uh number of lines which you want to
245:48 - like display in the on this terminal
245:50 - okay and also there is another option
245:52 - that is a hyph c option what it does so
245:55 - hyphen C option is nothing but like
245:57 - which we we use to get the uh like
246:00 - content of a particular size okay
246:02 - suppose if you want to print the content
246:04 - of only first like 30 bit or 10 bits so
246:09 - then for this we can use a hyphen C
246:11 - option
246:12 - okay so uh let's use
246:15 - it hyph C I will provide uh
246:21 - for states. txt so here you can see a
246:25 - and DH why this because this is only
246:28 - four bytes okay first four bytes it will
246:30 - provide us and what if I want to hit 12
246:36 - so here you can see it is just me
246:38 - providing me the 12 bytes okay this is
246:40 - uh 3 3 6 7 and again this is 5 7 + 5
246:45 - that is a 12 bytes okay so in this way
246:48 - you can use the hyph C option and also
246:50 - you can use I think together also for
246:53 - Capital let me use and you can see in s.
246:56 - XT you are getting this and in hayb you
246:59 - are
246:59 - getting this
247:02 - okay so uh and also there is one more
247:05 - option is remaining in this like hyphen
247:07 - V option what it does it basically just
247:09 - provide you the veros information iph
247:11 - stand from verbos which basically shows
247:14 - you the like information about execution
247:17 - of command like that let me use it for
247:20 - States so you can see st. txt like if we
247:24 - not use hyph V option then let's see
247:26 - what
247:27 - happens nothing okay so that's all guys
247:31 - for this particular video so I hope you
247:33 - liked it and we will meet in the next
247:34 - video okay so thank you thank you for
247:36 - watching
247:38 - now in this particular video we're going
247:40 - to learn about the tail command Okay so
247:43 - similarly just like a head command tail
247:45 - is also one command in but in this we uh
247:48 - like uh expect output from the downside
247:52 - or you can say the we try to get the
247:54 - output from the bottom of the txt file
247:57 - or any file like uh from which we want
248:01 - to like extract some kind of data like
248:04 - suppose you want to extract data from a
248:05 - loog file like you need
248:08 - last 10 number of lines if you need okay
248:11 - so in this case we can use the tail
248:13 - command Okay so uh the basic uh uses
248:16 - like you can try to learn about uh like
248:19 - how you can read the log file using tail
248:22 - command and all these things so these
248:24 - are the basic uses of this so uh I have
248:27 - already two files uh st. text and
248:29 - capital. txt okay so let me show you
248:32 - these two files so this is the content
248:35 - of states.
248:36 - txt
248:39 - and this is the content of capital. txt
248:42 - okay so on these two files we are going
248:44 - to use the tail command okay so I will
248:46 - use first tail command on the test.txt
248:48 - so what it will do let's check so it
248:51 - will just print the last 10 lines okay
248:56 - so here you can see they just printing
248:57 - the last 10 lines you can like get the 1
249:00 - 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 okay so using
249:05 - just simple tail and the file name what
249:07 - you will get you will get the by default
249:09 - last 10 lines but suppose if you want
249:11 - more more lines suppose if if you want
249:14 - 15 lines so how you can do it so nothing
249:17 - you just have to use hyphen and option
249:18 - and provide the number of lines which
249:20 - you want so I just want
249:22 - 15 so here I got the last 15 lines okay
249:28 - so you can use hyphen n option to get
249:30 - the last number of lines and similarly
249:33 - uh there is option of hyphen C option
249:36 - like which will provide provide you the
249:38 - like um what you can
249:40 - say last number of specific bites if you
249:43 - want suppose if I want uh 13 bytes I
249:47 - will use just hyph
249:50 - C and 13 so you can see I'm getting just
249:54 - West Bengal let me try higher
249:57 - number 16 again I think I will get same
250:00 - okay nothing uh I I got like this West
250:03 - Bengal and and okay suppose if I want uh
250:08 - 20
250:09 - btes uh
250:12 - sorry if I want how
250:15 - much 20 so here you can see I'm getting
250:19 - 20 bytes let's count like w 1 2 3 4 5 6
250:25 - 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and
250:32 - also there will be like uh some kind of
250:34 - particular size for spaces also okay so
250:38 - in this way we are getting the 20 bytes
250:39 - like a specific bits okay not bits bytes
250:42 - it is okay so you can use the hyph C
250:45 - option to get the a specific number of
250:47 - bits okay from a txt file or any kind of
250:49 - file so now if you want to get the like
250:53 - uh last 10 lines of both files how you
250:57 - can get it just simply use this command
251:01 - test. uh hyph in and the number of lines
251:04 - then provide the files file name which
251:06 - you want so I need the data from two
251:09 - files so you can see you can get easily
251:11 - like from capital. TX these are the last
251:14 - 10 lines and from st. text these are the
251:18 - last 10 lines okay so apart from this uh
251:21 - there's also a like very interesting
251:24 - thing uh in which you will learn in this
251:26 - particular video that is a monitoring
251:29 - any like uh any txt file Suppose there
251:32 - is a log system or something like that
251:34 - and if you want to monitor it so how you
251:37 - can do it it you you can use it just by
251:40 - applying tail command by which option
251:43 - you can use by using hyphen f okay so
251:45 - let's do
251:46 - [Music]
251:47 - it tail hyph app st. txt okay so uh
251:53 - first let me show you the content of
251:55 - stress. text so that will be clear to
251:57 - you so you can see at the end we have
251:59 - only West Bengal okay so now I will use
252:02 - tail hyph F states. txt and here you can
252:06 - see like it has printed the last 10
252:08 - lines and it is my monitoring this file
252:11 - so now what I will do I will just open
252:13 - up the again new
252:15 - terminal I hope it is visible to you I
252:18 - will move into the head
252:21 - directory and I have these two files and
252:24 - what I am going to do I will append some
252:27 - data in a st.
252:30 - txt and uh then here you you can
252:36 - see
252:38 - if I write something then it should
252:40 - reflect
252:42 - here hello okay so you can see Hello has
252:45 - been added if I want
252:48 - uh if I want to print
252:52 - Linux Fair
252:55 - India so here you can see whatever I'm
252:57 - writing here whatever I'm adding in this
252:59 - particular file it is get to monitored
253:01 - by this system like tell if we have used
253:04 - hyph app option to monitor this t. text
253:06 - file so whatever we are doing changes in
253:09 - that particular file it is reflecting
253:11 - here so like this you can also use this
253:14 - uh particular thing in the like uh log
253:17 - monitoring system okay so I hope you
253:20 - liked it like that was the interesting
253:21 - part of this particular video I hope you
253:23 - like it suppose we WR anything else okay
253:26 - so here you can see it is getting like
253:29 - reflecting here okay and all these
253:31 - things will get added into this
253:33 - particular st. text file now I will just
253:35 - save it and and now again I will try to
253:39 - check the content so here you can see
253:41 - all those extra contents has been added
253:43 - in that particular t uh St store txt
253:45 - file so that was the like uh most
253:48 - important or you can say most
253:50 - interesting thing of this particular
253:52 - video so I hope you liked it and please
253:55 - if you have any queries regarding this
253:57 - video so then you can ask us in the
253:58 - comment section okay so we will meet in
254:00 - the next video so thank you thank you
254:02 - for
254:04 - watching in this particular video we're
254:06 - going to cover about the CH own command
254:08 - that basically mean change ownership
254:10 - command Okay so before starting uh let
254:13 - me tell you the brief or little bit
254:15 - introduction about this command
254:17 - basically it means what as the name
254:19 - suggest that change ownership what does
254:22 - it basically means uh let's take a
254:24 - scenario of a corporate world okay in
254:26 - which you are working in a team and
254:28 - there are people with different roles
254:30 - okay and if you have access of some kind
254:32 - of file and you want to share that file
254:35 - to some another team okay so in this
254:38 - case you can use the CH own command okay
254:41 - like there will be one particular group
254:43 - for one team and you want to give that
254:46 - access to some other team member or some
254:50 - other group member you can say okay so
254:53 - it basically mean changing the ownership
254:55 - of a file or transferring the ownership
254:58 - uh to some other people or to some other
255:01 - user okay so we will start this uh okay
255:05 - so but before starting uh
255:07 - I will tell you to just uh set up your
255:09 - root account okay but because we will
255:12 - use root account and also one another
255:14 - user to perform this uh uh particular
255:18 - ch1 command Okay so to set up a root
255:20 - command first of all what you have to
255:21 - you have to just uh change the password
255:23 - if you don't know so enter the password
255:25 - command and the username that is a
255:28 - root and you have to just use a shudo
255:33 - and and now you can enter the new
255:36 - password which which you
255:38 - want okay password red successfully and
255:42 - one more thing what we have to do I will
255:44 - add another user add user and I will
255:47 - give the name as
255:53 - uh
255:55 - ainash okay so enter a
256:03 - password I will not provide any kind of
256:05 - information okay yes okay so user has
256:08 - been created now what you will do first
256:10 - log in as a root in this
256:16 - terminal uh wrong password I enter wrong
256:21 - password yeah now I I'm logged in as a
256:23 - root user here you can see root and now
256:26 - again I will open up another terminal in
256:28 - which I will log in with the credential
256:30 - of
256:33 - ainash uh I hope it is visible to you
256:35 - now yeah it should be visible to you
256:38 - guys so now what we have to do uh we
256:40 - have to just log in as a different user
256:42 - that is a uh
256:45 - aash okay just enter the password of
256:48 - that particular user uh test uh a okay
256:52 - so here we you can see uh I have another
256:55 - user in this terminal another user in
256:57 - this terminal okay so this is the root
257:00 - user and this is the ainash user
257:05 - okay
257:07 - so now both the user are in the home
257:09 - directory let me do here also same thing
257:13 - okay so both the users are in the home
257:15 - directory okay so now what I have to do
257:17 - to see the permissions or uh to see
257:20 - anything uh permission of a file or
257:23 - directory or anything else which you
257:25 - want what what command you enter just
257:27 - you enter
257:29 - LS hyphen l y l just a long listing of
257:33 - files you can say like that okay so here
257:36 - you can see we have we have three
257:37 - directories and these are the some
257:39 - permissions based on those directory
257:41 - that is rewrite execute read and then
257:45 - for others there is no any permissions
257:48 - okay but the these are regarding what
257:50 - you can say these are regarding your um
257:53 - users like this is the users directory
257:55 - but we don't have to work on this I will
257:58 - work on some different directories or
258:00 - different files okay so what I will do I
258:02 - will just create a one file that is
258:04 - touch file.txt
258:07 - and I will do LS hyl and that particular
258:09 - file name so here you can see in this
258:11 - case uh if you have watched our previous
258:14 - videos on permissions okay so I think
258:16 - you will get it easily so these three
258:19 - represents the permissions of
258:22 - users and this is for groups and these
258:25 - are from others user so here you can see
258:29 - uh groups has only read permission and
258:31 - other others also has only read
258:33 - permissions okay but uh uh uh this
258:37 - particular user has a read and write the
258:39 - permission okay so who is the owner
258:41 - right now the owner right now
258:43 - is Root Root is the owner right now okay
258:48 - so now what uh you have to suppose or
258:51 - you have to think like that you have to
258:53 - share this file. Tex to someone else to
258:56 - ainash okay this user you have to share
259:00 - now what will happen let's do LS and I
259:02 - will try to access this file so I hope I
259:05 - can access because others have read
259:08 - permissions so let me H enter this
259:11 - command so here you can see we have not
259:13 - got any error like permission denied so
259:15 - now what I will do I will just add one
259:18 - line in this particular file hi this is
259:22 - root
259:24 - user contr D to
259:26 - save okay and now again I will try to
259:29 - access and here you can see I am able to
259:32 - access this file but if I will go to
259:35 - change the permission in this particular
259:37 - file then at that time what will happen
259:39 - we will get an error of permission
259:41 - denied why why we will get error the
259:44 - reason behind is this that we don't have
259:47 - execute permissions okay so now what we
259:50 - have to do uh if I will try to add some
259:54 - extra lines in this file.txt so how we
259:58 - can do file. TT let's see if we are able
260:01 - to add or not so here you can see
260:03 - permission denied so okay as I said
260:05 - earlier like if we don't have permission
260:08 - like execute permission so to change the
260:12 - to change in the file okay so to do this
260:16 - uh we have two options one is change
260:18 - ownership just for one particular user
260:21 - or simply add execute permission for
260:24 - others using uh CH command okay uh
260:28 - change permission like CH mode command
260:30 - okay you can use uh that command to
260:34 - change the permission for all the users
260:36 - but but uh that is not a useful case or
260:39 - that is not a best scenario because you
260:41 - don't want to share that file to all the
260:44 - users okay so that's why CH own command
260:47 - came into this role and that's why we
260:49 - are using it so how you can do
260:52 - it just use Chon and whatever the
260:56 - username you want to uh uh here our
260:58 - username is uh this particular username
261:00 - is I
261:02 - ainash so ainash and I will just uh
261:05 - provide the file name and done now I'll
261:09 - do LS I funel and here you can see AAS
261:12 - is now the uh new owner of that
261:15 - particular file so LS iph let me do do
261:19 - one more time yeah here you can see Ain
261:21 - is the new
261:22 - owner sorry and uh
261:27 - now if I will try to change in this
261:29 - particular file then obviously I will be
261:32 - able to change here I will add just uh
261:38 - this line has been added
261:41 - by ainash control D to save and again I
261:45 - will try to access and here you can see
261:48 - this line has been added by which user
261:53 - ainash okay we can also uh use multiple
261:57 - options with the Chon command like Chon
261:59 - hyphen C for uh what you can say for
262:04 - informations okay like it will display
262:07 - just like uh information like uh a
262:10 - permission has been transfered from this
262:12 - user to this user let's do this uh with
262:14 - this again let's hope it works or not
262:17 - let's see uh CH on hyphy and I will
262:20 - provide the username that is
262:22 - ainash and
262:26 - file okay it's not showing
262:30 - me V okay ownership file. retained as
262:35 - ainash okay here you can see we have
262:37 - used hyphone V for warus it just
262:39 - displays the extra
262:50 - information yeah it's still a okay so no
262:54 - worries so in this way CH own command
262:57 - works okay so I hope you like this video
262:59 - and I hope you got the concept of how
263:01 - Chon works okay so that's all for
263:03 - today's now in this particular video we
263:05 - are going to cover about CH group
263:06 - command it basically means the change
263:08 - group or you can say the change group
263:11 - ownership okay from one group to another
263:14 - okay to understand this uh uh command
263:17 - just think like a basic scenario Suppose
263:19 - there is there are the two teams in a
263:20 - company that is the one for uh tester
263:22 - and another for the you can say uh that
263:25 - developer okay uh suppose uh tester
263:29 - wants to share uh one file or uh to some
263:33 - other group members that is uh they
263:36 - these are some kind of group members
263:37 - okay so uh not uh for a particular
263:42 - member of that group but uh this team
263:45 - tester team wants to share those file to
263:47 - all the groups so in this scenario we
263:50 - can easily use this CH group command
263:53 - okay so in this kind of scenario it will
263:55 - be
263:56 - helpful um because uh you don't have to
263:59 - share that file to one particular uh
264:02 - user okay so that if you share that file
264:06 - or change the ownership from from file
264:08 - to that group so every member of that
264:11 - particular you group can easily access
264:14 - the can easily access that particular
264:17 - file okay so to understand this scenario
264:20 - first what we will need to do we will
264:21 - first need to create a group okay I hope
264:25 - it is visible to you guys uh so to add
264:29 - groups uh what is the command so the
264:31 - command is nothing but the group AD and
264:35 - uh group name
264:36 - okay so what we will do group
264:39 - add and let's make a group name as a
264:43 - developers permiss because we have not
264:45 - used
264:51 - sudo uh sorry I have enter wrong
264:54 - password I think yeah group has been
264:57 - created uh now what I will do I will
264:59 - just uh create two users add
265:04 - user user one
265:07 - again we have to use
265:09 - sudo
265:12 - password no extra information I have to
265:15 - provide yes user one is added user
265:19 - two
265:21 - test
265:24 - test yes both the user has been created
265:27 - now what we have to do we have to just
265:29 - uh uh add those two users into the
265:32 - developer group okay so how you can add
265:34 - the those two users into the developer
265:36 - group so for that also we have a
265:38 - particular command that is a user
265:40 - modification so I will use sudo user
265:42 - mode hyph a and uh uh we use I think Hy
265:48 - and the group name is developers and the
265:50 - name of the user that is a
265:53 - user user one and user two I hope it
265:57 - should work again not working user one
265:59 - if I provide oh yeah added and again
266:02 - user to okay so groups has been added uh
266:05 - these two users has been added to the
266:07 - developer group to check what you can
266:11 - do G10 and group okay so here you can
266:16 - see user one and user two and in
266:18 - developers we have two users that is
266:20 - user one
266:21 - and user to okay so uh now what we have
266:26 - to do uh I will create one file with our
266:29 - root user so first of all what I will do
266:31 - I will change
266:33 - my like switch to the root user
266:38 - user I will go move back to directory in
266:42 - LS okay we have file.txt I will first
266:45 - remove file.txt
266:48 - and
266:51 - test okay both are you now what we have
266:54 - to do I will create one file that is
266:56 - touch file.txt okay so if I will change
267:00 - check the permissions for this
267:02 - particular file so here you can see we
267:06 - have root root the user is root and the
267:08 - group is also root user so in this case
267:11 - what we have to do we have to just
267:12 - change the group ownership not user like
267:15 - this one we have to change this group
267:17 - ownership
267:18 - to some other users or to some other
267:21 - group so but in this case here you can
267:23 - see in the permission we have the group
267:26 - has only read permission okay so now uh
267:29 - what we can do uh we can change the
267:31 - group uh from root to which group that
267:35 - is a developer group so for this we have
267:37 - a command that uh is CH group so how you
267:41 - can do it CH
267:43 - group
267:46 - CH grp and the group name is
267:52 - developers okay developers and uh then
267:55 - what we have to do we have to just
267:56 - provide the file
267:57 - name okay now I'll do lsph and file.txt
268:01 - and here you can see the group name has
268:03 - been changed from root to Developers
268:06 - okay so now what I will do I will log in
268:08 - using uh both the
268:10 - user Su user
268:12 - one and I will enter the password test
268:17 - and again one more terminal I will open
268:19 - up
268:21 - here uh like this I will increase the
268:24 - font size so it should be visible to you
268:27 - and Su which user that was user to okay
268:32 - and again enter the password same thing
268:36 - move
268:39 - back here also the same thing I will do
268:41 - I will move back one directory and I
268:43 - will do LSL and file.txt and here you
268:47 - can see developers and again
268:52 - here
268:54 - developers
268:56 - okay uh wait a
269:02 - minute um what key I just entered here
269:07 - LSL file.txt okay so here you can see in
269:10 - both the scenario we are getting
269:12 - developers as a group okay so now what I
269:15 - as a user one I will try to uh like
269:18 - change
269:20 - the some file content file.txt and here
269:24 - you can see it is showing me permission
269:26 - denied why it is showing permission
269:28 - denied
269:30 - because here you can see we have not
269:33 - added any kind of permission he has just
269:36 - read permissions
269:39 - okay so now what we can do
269:47 - uh okay so we have only the read
269:50 - permission here for the groups okay so
269:53 - if I will just uh try to access so I can
269:56 - just only read this file.txt but if I
269:59 - want to uh add some kind of text or add
270:03 - something in that particular file so
270:05 - here you can see the permission is
270:07 - denied so now what we will need to do we
270:09 - will need to just add a permission for
270:11 - the groups for that particular file okay
270:14 - so how we can do it using the CH mode
270:15 - command just because uh we don't have uh
270:20 - like execute permission to the groups
270:22 - that's why we are getting this error so
270:24 - CH mode what you can do for group G+ I
270:26 - will do uh write and execute and I will
270:29 - remove the read permission uh for others
270:32 - and the file name that is file.txt
270:36 - and done and uh now in this case I will
270:39 - just
270:41 - check so here you can see uh read right
270:45 - execute has been added for groups and uh
270:48 - uh read has been removed from for others
270:51 - okay and the group is developers as we
270:53 - performed earlier so now what we can do
270:56 - uh uh if I will try to access this uh
271:00 - file that file file.txt so now let's try
271:04 - for user one I will remove all those
271:06 - things so
271:08 - cat file. dxt so here you can see I will
271:12 - just hi this line has been entered
271:19 - by user one control D to save and again
271:24 - here also uh I will I will here I will
271:27 - try to access this
271:29 - file uh sorry file.txt and here you can
271:34 - see that line I'm getting and for uh
271:37 - user two also I will try to enter some
271:40 - line with respect to user two that is
271:45 - high this line has been added by user
271:52 - 2 contr D to save and again I will try
271:56 - to access so let's access by user
272:00 - one uh not user one uh it's file.txt
272:05 - and here you can see both the lines has
272:07 - been added and it is accessible by both
272:10 - the users so this is the benefit of like
272:12 - group command like uh you can um you
272:16 - don't have to share that file with each
272:18 - and every user Suppose there there is a
272:21 - team of 50 members okay so uh you you
272:25 - you can't like you can't just share
272:27 - those file to all those 50 people
272:30 - separately okay so that's why uh we have
272:33 - this group command change group owners
272:35 - ship and just
272:37 - uh like that file will be accessible by
272:40 - each and every group member so guys
272:44 - that's all for today's video on this
272:45 - video we're going to start to post
272:48 - videos on networking okay like whatever
272:50 - the commands which are used in the
272:52 - networking domain in our Linux operating
272:53 - system those are the commands which we
272:55 - will learn so basically we will start
272:58 - with the First Command that is the Ping
273:00 - command Okay so before starting uh the
273:03 - Ping command I hope you are aware of a
273:05 - basic of networking if not then let me
273:06 - tell you about like from a scratch
273:09 - okay so these are the computers for
273:11 - suppose this these are the two computers
273:13 - okay A and B are the two computers and
273:15 - they are connected to each other so now
273:17 - what happens in this they basically form
273:19 - a kind of network what happens when
273:21 - multiple devices connected to each other
273:23 - okay so that process just called as a
273:26 - networking okay so in the networking to
273:29 - are many Concepts like uh what is an IP
273:31 - address what is a MAC
273:33 - address uh like
273:36 - different network topologies okay so we
273:38 - don't have to discuss that much thing
273:39 - particular in this video so basically
273:41 - you just need about what is an IP
273:43 - address okay so uh let me tell you about
273:46 - the basics of IP address that uh uh you
273:49 - can think one of analogy is like
273:53 - U uh what you can say just like uh in a
273:56 - family uh everyone has a separate name
274:00 - okay suppose one one name is aush ainash
274:04 - anit anything okay they suppose they are
274:07 - the siblings and they know each their
274:09 - names okay so similarly in our Network
274:12 - what happens each device has their own
274:14 - name or their IP address okay so
274:17 - basically an IP address just an address
274:20 - which identifies a device on a network
274:25 - okay I hope that is a clear to you so
274:27 - what is an IP address and also there's a
274:29 - concept of Mac address so Mac address
274:32 - just you can think like of it as a
274:34 - fingerprint of a person suppose a person
274:37 - changes his name or her name but he
274:40 - can't change their fingerprint okay it
274:42 - will be always same so that's why Mac
274:46 - address is just like a permanent address
274:48 - that is like a printed on your NC card
274:51 - okay in your
274:54 - PC so now we will start with the Ping
274:57 - command uh let me enter the
275:04 - password
275:08 - I hope the terminal visible let me
275:10 - increase the font
275:12 - size
275:14 - okay so now what is a ping command so
275:17 - ping command is basically a simple
275:19 - command which you basically use to uh
275:22 - check whether the our like host is
275:26 - reachable or not
275:27 - suppose I will enter google.com so what
275:31 - google.com is kind of one of the host
275:33 - okay or you can see domain name
275:35 - so I will try to check whether I'm able
275:38 - to reach there or not okay ping
275:41 - google.com so here you can see I'm
275:44 - getting multiple uh request from them
275:47 - now I will just hit contr C to stop it
275:50 - okay so here you can see this is the 64
275:53 - bytes uh like uh packet size what so now
275:57 - what is a
275:58 - packet okay so packet is basically just
276:01 - like a data you can think of it like a
276:03 - data that is that transfer suppose you
276:06 - send a image then it it gets divided
276:09 - into different small small small packets
276:11 - or chunks then it is transfer so packet
276:13 - is just like a you can think as a small
276:16 - data
276:18 - okay so basically what happens when you
276:20 - ping uh and when you use a ping command
276:24 - so it uh basically what sends the icmp
276:28 - Eco request which basically means that
276:30 - is internate control message protocol
276:32 - request okay so icmp is just a one of a
276:35 - protocol that is used by the Ping
276:38 - command okay to like for that these are
276:41 - for this purpose like for receiving or
276:44 - for sending like Eco request and Eco
276:47 - response is one of the thing which comes
276:49 - in this role okay so whenever it send
276:52 - that is called as the icmp Eco request
276:54 - and whenever it receive that that is
276:56 - called as the icmp Eco response okay so
276:59 - there are multiple attributes here you
277:00 - can see like what is this uh sequence
277:03 - number dtl okay so I will cover like
277:05 - most important things first this is from
277:09 - it means it is just and the what you can
277:12 - say it is just the IP address of this
277:15 - google.com Okay so google.com is
277:18 - identified by this IP address like from
277:23 - where this request is coming that is 64
277:25 - bytes is coming from where so it is
277:28 - coming from this IP address this is
277:30 - maybe the domain name or something like
277:32 - that or servers maybe uhuh we don't know
277:35 - about it what is this okay which domain
277:38 - from where this is coming but we know
277:40 - that this is the IP address IP address
277:42 - of this
277:43 - Google.com this is a TT is nothing but
277:45 - the time to leave it basically means
277:47 - like how many hopes or how many
277:50 - routers uh this process has covered okay
277:54 - and time is just like uh how much time
277:57 - it took to get the response or send the
278:01 - response it basically means what happens
278:03 - the total time the first this is our PC
278:06 - this is google.com
278:07 - Okay so it will ask for are you there
278:10 - are you alive or not Google uh reply
278:14 - goog will just reply yes I'm alive okay
278:19 - so uh this is the total time that is uh
278:22 - here it is where it is uh here this one
278:24 - this is 133 millisecond okay so at what
278:27 - happens at in one second there are at
278:30 - least I think four to five packets or
278:33 - request four to five request are s
278:36 - okay so ping command we basically use
278:39 - for the like internet connectivity
278:42 - purposes further we will check about
278:44 - another command that is the trace rout
278:45 - ip config if if config sorry we'll learn
278:49 - about all those things I hope uh you
278:51 - liked this video and now in this video
278:53 - we are going to talk about the most
278:54 - important command that is the trace root
278:56 - command okay so now in this video we
278:58 - will discuss about this particular
278:59 - command so before starting the actual
279:02 - implementation of this command let me
279:03 - discuss with you like basics of this
279:07 - Trace root command okay so what are the
279:09 - basics of Trace root command as a name
279:12 - suggest Trace root what does it mean it
279:15 - just means you are tracing a root okay
279:19 - uh just uh uh think like an example like
279:22 - you have to go from like uh Mumbai to
279:25 - Bangalore okay so you can go from
279:28 - different routs and you will first Trace
279:30 - like how you can go to that destination
279:33 - Okay so Trace root is a command which is
279:36 - used to find the what are the number of
279:39 - hopes hopes means you can say number of
279:42 - routers which are included between your
279:44 - source and the
279:46 - destination okay so we will start with
279:49 - this so basically uh actually I have an
279:51 - image for you also like Suppose there is
279:54 - a source and this is the destination and
279:56 - these are the number of routers included
279:58 - between the source and destination okay
280:01 - so Trace rot is a command which will
280:03 - tell you like what are the number of
280:05 - hopes present between source and
280:07 - destination like in our this today's
280:09 - implementation we will see uh
280:13 - like the number of hops which will be uh
280:18 - included between our this local machine
280:21 - and
280:22 - the google.com Okay so for in actually
280:28 - Trace does not come with preinstall so
280:31 - we will need to install it like if you
280:32 - hit this command then you will get uh
280:35 - this error message or you will get a
280:36 - suggestion
280:38 - to First enter this command to install
280:41 - trer so we will do this sudo AP install
280:44 - AP just a packet manager you can say
280:48 - okay and
280:50 - [Music]
280:53 - password and now it will install your
280:55 - Trace root command
280:57 - Okay so it will take a little bit of
281:02 - time uh let's wait for for
281:05 - [Music]
281:06 - it so it's also just like a trace root
281:09 - command just also you can say like a
281:11 - ping command okay like we can use it
281:13 - also for checking the whether uh the
281:16 - particular server or particular host is
281:18 - reachable or not okay so uh now we will
281:23 - start with the trace root command Okay
281:25 - so first of all uh I will clear the
281:28 - screen and high PR visible to you so
281:29 - Trace
281:31 - root
281:33 - google.com Okay
281:35 - okay so here you can see the first uh
281:38 - for is 10.
281:42 - 0.2.1 it's like basically
281:45 - the uh what you can
281:47 - say gateway address like the first
281:51 - address through which my PC is getting
281:54 - connected and the star means like it is
281:57 - whether we are not getting any response
281:59 - or something like that
282:03 - okay so here you can see we didn't get
282:06 - any kind of
282:07 - response I don't know why uh this is
282:10 - it's showing me star star star and star
282:13 - means unreachable host you can say like
282:16 - uh or not unreachable it means like you
282:19 - are not getting response okay and the
282:21 - maximum hopes uh can be it will try for
282:26 - 30 okay uh let me again check whether my
282:30 - internet is working or not okay internet
282:33 - is working fine
282:36 - okay five packet transmitter five
282:38 - receive 0% loss let me try with again
282:42 - Trace root with DNS server let me
282:47 - try first
282:49 - [Music]
282:51 - gateway again same the ST means like not
282:57 - responding uh here you can see the
282:59 - maximum hopes can be
283:02 - 30 okay
283:05 - I that should show
283:07 - [Music]
283:10 - something okay let's
283:16 - [Music]
283:19 - hope okay so it's still uh asri so it's
283:23 - not still we are not getting
283:25 - response okay let me check the network
283:27 - setting
283:30 - here okay it's some bre
283:33 - adapter
283:37 - okay uh let me try
283:40 - again Trace
283:43 - root
283:46 - google.com first is get okay yeah now
283:49 - now we are getting here you can see from
283:51 - second and third hops we are not getting
283:53 - any kind of response so asri basically
283:55 - means uh we we are not getting any
283:59 - response from that particular router or
284:02 - you can say hopes okay so now here you
284:05 - can see the first is Gateway like
284:06 - gateway gateway just means like the very
284:11 - first router or very first uh you can
284:14 - say what you can say gate uh like
284:17 - through which your packet will pass like
284:19 - the very first router you can say
284:21 - Gateway just like a your first
284:23 - router okay suppose you are connected to
284:26 - a Hotpot okay then your phone will be
284:29 - off it will act as a first router okay
284:32 - first gateway or whether your phone is
284:34 - connected to the your ISP or anything
284:37 - else you can say or just take an example
284:40 - of your Wi-Fi if you're connected to a
284:43 - Wi-Fi then the first request will be
284:45 - passed through your Wi-Fi then it will
284:48 - connected to some other router then
284:49 - another router then another okay then
284:51 - finally you will reach to
284:53 - the destination so here you can see uh
284:56 - we are getting many results here like uh
285:00 - uh I think we have
285:02 - covered approx 14 hopes here okay let's
285:08 - check whether it will come in one line
285:11 - let me increase this
285:13 - okay uh I think now it's better
285:16 - yeah uh so now uh here you can see the
285:19 - first gateway like from which we are
285:22 - getting the
285:24 - response and these are the time like uh
285:28 - what you can say uh round trip times
285:31 - like uh from like when we go and then
285:36 - when we come back then the overall time
285:39 - okay so here you can see uh the
285:41 - different IP addresses uh of different
285:44 - routers then the total time taken by
285:46 - them these are all the details you can
285:49 - see and at the last head you can see we
285:51 - reached to the
285:53 - destination okay and
285:56 - uh okay we reach to the
286:00 - destination yes so it overall take 84.1
286:04 - for 1
286:06 - [Music]
286:07 - millisecond okay so uh again let me try
286:10 - with uh some other uh website like let's
286:14 - take a
286:16 - IBM
286:21 - [Music]
286:30 - ibm.com I think my internet connectivity
286:32 - is slow today that's why taking much
286:37 - time so you can see you're getting
286:39 - different
286:42 - uh IP addresses of different routers
286:48 - okay let's
286:55 - wait okay so we have covered seven
287:02 - rades 10 11 12 13 we are not getting any
287:05 - kind of
287:06 - response again no no response no
287:09 - response we're
287:11 - getting oh my God
287:14 - okay I think maximum hope is 30 so I
287:17 - don't think it will get
287:21 - complete
287:24 - okay okay no problem let me think about
287:28 - some other website
287:30 - uh Which is popular one uh let's take
287:34 - take
287:35 - uh which website should I take
287:41 - man Trace
287:45 - root
287:47 - uh let me search for any
287:56 - website booking.com okay let's Che for
288:03 - booking.com
288:09 - [Music]
288:23 - booking.com I hope we should
288:33 - reach
288:34 - like here you can see like all this line
288:36 - represents the information about that
288:38 - particular hopes like the fifth one is
288:41 - the the IP address of that hope is this
288:43 - like 2231
288:48 - 19625
288:51 - [Music]
288:53 - okay and also it shows us the round trip
288:57 - time round trip I hope you got it like
288:59 - uh uh from sending packet to receiving
289:02 - back like from requesting to
289:05 - response okay this is the round trip
289:11 - time so here you can see we have got a
289:13 - still uh seven
289:15 - hopes uh let's
289:18 - wait it's 8
289:21 - [Music]
289:29 - [Music]
289:32 - now
289:41 - okay I think we have reached uh like
289:45 - we're getting this booking.com
289:48 - so approximately we have
289:54 - [Music]
289:55 - Reed okay now it will get
289:59 - uh yeah
290:02 - completed Okay so here we are not
290:04 - getting any kind of responses from the
290:07 - particular uh what you can
290:10 - say particular hops why it happens it
290:13 - may be because of they are unresponsive
290:16 - or they are turned off or whether it's
290:17 - also because of the firewall reasons
290:19 - like some of the firewalls does not
290:21 - reply back to this ping request or icmp
290:24 - packet here also in t also we are
290:26 - sending that that icmp packet like
290:29 - internet what the what was the for form
290:32 - that it is internet control message
290:33 - protocol yeah we can say it like that
290:36 - okay so some of the routers are not
290:38 - routers some of the firewalls does not
290:40 - reply back to those packet that's why we
290:42 - are getting this it may be one kind of
290:44 - reason or whether they are a turned off
290:46 - we don't know okay but still here you
290:49 - can see we have approximately Reed
290:52 - because here I can see the domain name
290:54 - of their of their website that is
290:57 - booking.com
290:59 - okay so it may be one of the
291:02 - reason uh also we can use uh some
291:05 - different options with this stress root
291:06 - command like hyphen n options for like
291:09 - better view let's try uh with hyph and
291:12 - what looks like let's try drro hyph and
291:16 - let's go with our Google baba
291:20 - okay okay now
291:23 - damn and you can see like uh as soon
291:27 - like very fast we got the result so here
291:31 - you can see 192
291:35 - uh first hope second third un
291:38 - responsive
291:40 - one8
291:42 - 17.24 a211 whether it is the our last
291:46 - node uh let me check with
291:49 - ping I don't think because it start with
291:52 - 142 yeah okay so this is not the address
291:56 - which we
291:58 - expecting
292:01 - M but 142 251
292:06 - okay so here it should show me that
292:09 - particular uh like the last uh IP
292:13 - address I was expecting this address
292:17 - okay let's try with
292:23 - uh other
292:25 - website.com
292:28 - not yaho it's
292:32 - Yahoo
292:34 - okay I have not used hyph and option let
292:37 - me use
292:41 - [Music]
292:47 - that okay so here also we can see like
292:51 - 74.6 dot
292:55 - like here you can see the first 10 octed
292:58 - and second octed is same then we can we
293:01 - are in in the network we can say like
293:06 - that okay so basically like T command
293:09 - just used to find a number of hopes
293:13 - which lies between the source and the
293:16 - destination okay so we are getting a and
293:19 - not getting response just because of
293:21 - their firewall uh settings like uh uh it
293:25 - shows us the like don't reply to the
293:27 - icmb packet maybe for the security
293:30 - regions uh because uh there is a tool in
293:33 - in our Linux or k Linux system that is
293:35 - the nmap which we use for the network
293:38 - scanning okay so we also face that error
293:44 - because when we go with the network
293:45 - testing then in this case uh we
293:48 - basically get that
293:50 - error so that's why uh no any company or
293:53 - no any organization want to uh what we
293:57 - can say they don't want to replace
293:59 - anyone you can say like that okay so
294:03 - that that's all for today's video guys
294:05 - and I hope you liked it and yeah if you
294:07 - have any queries then please uh ask us
294:09 - in the comment section yeah but before
294:11 - ending this video I have to show you one
294:14 - more thing for you like for
294:17 - Windows I know it's still uh Linux
294:20 - series but uh T rot is a command which
294:22 - we can use on both windows and the Linux
294:25 - but in Windows we just uh use this one t
294:29 - CRT and again let's enter google.com
294:34 - and here you can see the first hope it
294:35 - is taking 32 2 millisecond 2 millisecond
294:39 - and the IP address the IP address of the
294:42 - first
294:43 - hope
294:45 - okay so let's wait for some
294:49 - time it I don't think it will take much
294:51 - time uh okay for second H request timed
294:56 - out again yeah
295:01 - yeah I will take just I don't think more
295:04 - than 15 seconds
295:07 - now so here also it is just sending the
295:10 - icmp packet
295:12 - request okay when we will start with the
295:15 - networking if in future then you will
295:17 - get to know about the what are the
295:19 - different protocols
295:20 - used okay like for web we use sttp stps
295:25 - protocol and also we use different uh
295:29 - for remote connectivity we use SSH FTP
295:33 - so we will learn all about these like
295:34 - how we can do with all these in our
295:38 - Linux operating
295:41 - system let's
295:45 - [Music]
295:51 - wait now8 hops I think in Windows it's
295:55 - working fine
296:02 - um
296:04 - now
296:06 - nine it is unresponsive
296:09 - maybe yeah two stke three and the third
296:13 - one will come up yeah and the 10th one
296:16 - is
296:18 - here let's check what will be the IP
296:21 - address of
296:28 - this okay
296:32 - 123
296:35 - I just want to ask you one question like
296:36 - do you know about the uh IPv6 address if
296:41 - is then yeah please
296:42 - comment comment about this IP address
296:45 - about IPv6
296:47 - address okay
296:51 - so okay finally I think we have reached
296:54 - to the destination with the number of
296:57 - hopes 14 okay yeah now now here you can
297:00 - see uh this is 142. 250 t.1
297:04 - 19246 it is the same IP address and the
297:09 - destination IP address is also the same
297:12 - okay so in this way uh we are getting uh
297:16 - like the number of different hopes like
297:19 - uh we started from 1 and 14 we reached
297:23 - to that our particular destination so
297:26 - this is the beauty of this command okay
297:28 - so I hope you like this because at the
297:31 - end we got all the like particular
297:34 - result like required result because it
297:38 - will show the like exact uh utility of
297:41 - this command like
297:43 - uh uh we are uh requesting for this and
297:47 - still again we are getting the same
297:49 - thing like we're getting the destination
297:52 - address as same as the IP address okay
297:55 - so that's all guys so if you have any qu
297:57 - then please ask now in this particular
297:59 - video we are going to learn about one of
298:01 - the most important command that is a MTR
298:02 - command okay so basically uh MTR command
298:06 - is nothing but uh like combination of
298:08 - the two commands which we have learned
298:09 - in our previous videos that is the Ping
298:11 - and the trace root command so now in
298:14 - this video we are going to learn about
298:16 - uh this and we will use like see the
298:19 - both the features of the Ping command
298:20 - and the trace root command in this
298:22 - particular single command Okay so let's
298:24 - start with
298:25 - the
298:27 - basic like uh what we have to uh write
298:30 - that is MTR and enter the then host name
298:33 - I will just go with the google.com and
298:35 - hit enter okay so here you can see like
298:39 - uh this is refreshing again and again
298:41 - and again okay so basically what's
298:43 - happening here you can see the you will
298:46 - get the percentage loss and all the what
298:49 - are the number of packets send what are
298:51 - the last received average based and all
298:53 - these things okay so basically What's
298:55 - Happening Here you here you can see the
298:57 - number of hops like from our what you
299:01 - can say from our source to the Des ation
299:03 - okay so there are approx 10 hops here in
299:07 - this case so uh like basically with this
299:10 - command you are getting the overall uh
299:12 - what you can say overall statistics and
299:14 - what happens in this particular command
299:16 - as you can see this page is refreshing
299:18 - again and again and again so we started
299:20 - from zero and now we are still at here
299:22 - you can see we are at 48 again 4950 so
299:25 - what is this happening this is basically
299:27 - nothing but uh the Ping request okay so
299:31 - here uh this command like what it does
299:34 - it sends ping request again and again
299:36 - and again so uh with ping request what
299:39 - we send we send the which protocol we
299:41 - use icmp like internet control message
299:44 - protocol we use okay so uh here you can
299:47 - see that again I will like uh run this
299:51 - command to stop this we have to just hit
299:55 - q and it will stop okay again let me
299:59 - check with the for another domain uh
300:02 - let's try for
300:03 - uh gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try
300:07 - for
300:10 - facebook.com so here you can see here
300:12 - also we are getting our 10 hops so there
300:15 - is no any packet loss here in this
300:18 - case Okay so this is the again at 11
300:22 - times that is 13 14 15 16 all these
300:25 - things you can see so to control the
300:27 - your what you can say ping request time
300:29 - like suppose you want to Ping again
300:32 - after after some some after some seconds
300:35 - like suppose you want to Ping after 2
300:37 - seconds so how you can do it so for this
300:39 - we use a special function not function
300:41 - we will say just it is a just an option
300:44 - that is a hyph i option okay so let's uh
300:47 - use that MTR hyph
300:51 - I and we will specify the time for 2
300:55 - second and
300:58 - uh for domain name let's go with the
301:01 - YouTube
301:05 - okay so here you can see now it's not
301:08 - like earlier like it's sending the Ping
301:10 - request after 2 seconds so you can see
301:13 - the like uh change in the frequency of
301:15 - sending packets okay so here you can see
301:18 - F4 now 7 now 8 so it's slow slower than
301:22 - earlier okay so in this way you can
301:25 - control the Ping
301:27 - request and here you can see the IP
301:30 - addresses of all the Hops which are
301:32 - which like between our from the source
301:34 - and
301:35 - destination okay so now moving forward
301:38 - uh suppose if you want to uh display
301:42 - only the what you can say only IP
301:45 - address not host names like actually we
301:47 - are getting here uh IP add but still
301:50 - there is a option of hyphn so we will
301:52 - use it let me clear the screen MTR hyphn
301:56 - and uh let's take some basic one uh our
302:00 - indan website uh let me
302:07 - search not brave let me open
302:17 - Chrome okay I will just search for let's
302:20 - search for
302:22 - blockchain so here okay here is the one
302:25 - website Investopedia okay or here is
302:29 - also blockchain.com is also one kind of
302:31 - website let's let me check it
302:33 - live yeah it's live okay we
302:37 - can find the IP and all what are the
302:42 - Hops present between this so let
302:46 - me go like this first blockchain.com
302:49 - okay
302:51 - accessible 104
302:54 - okay okay now what I will do I will use
303:00 - the hyphen n option
303:04 - blockchain.com
303:06 - so here you can see only IP address as
303:08 - earlier also we were getting only IP
303:10 - address but so what happens in some
303:12 - cases we get the host names okay we get
303:16 - the host names in place of these IP
303:18 - addresses okay so these are basically
303:20 - your IP V4 address that is your 32bit
303:22 - addresses okay we will learn about more
303:25 - about in networking part okay about ipv4
303:29 - address and IPv6 address okay so moving
303:32 - for forward in this uh uh video so we
303:34 - will go with one of the like uh option
303:38 - with in which we store the output in
303:41 - different different files like different
303:43 - formats you can say like we can store in
303:45 - XML we can store in Jon and also we can
303:49 - store in uh like other file format we
303:53 - can say uh I'm not
303:55 - getting what are the file formats let me
303:58 - check with
304:00 - uh okay so now here we will see uh what
304:05 - are the file formats
304:10 - so hyph B
304:13 - not this one local
304:16 - envirment
304:21 - packet okay CSV is also
304:27 - there
304:29 - okay here we can see if yeah here you
304:31 - can see iph iph XML is there we can use
304:34 - hyph iph XML for storing the output in
304:37 - uh like this
304:40 - okay so let me try with this hyph hyon
304:44 - XML google.com whether I will need to
304:47 - provide path or not I don't
304:52 - know
304:55 - okay contrl C to stop like 1 minute I
305:00 - will create One
305:01 - Directory
305:05 - uh CD
305:09 - blockchain and
305:11 - NTR iPhone iph
305:13 - XML
305:16 - google.com and now it will be sending
305:18 - like it's not displaying us here I will
305:20 - just h control CLS okay no files has
305:23 - been
305:24 - created uh hph
305:28 - o c. XML whether it's work or not
305:33 - okay it's not
305:35 - working uh let me
305:40 - check okay uh let's try with
305:48 - CSV okay it's not printing
305:51 - anything I don't know what's the problem
305:53 - here
305:55 - uh basically what happens it it displays
305:58 - the output in that particular format
306:00 - like if head is CS then comma separated
306:03 - values okay yeah okay we got it now so
306:06 - here you can see uh like this is the
306:08 - comma separated output in this case and
306:11 - if I will try with the XML uh actually
306:15 - uh file is not created the output is
306:18 - displayed in that particular format okay
306:20 - let's wait for two to 3 seconds I hope
306:23 - it will
306:27 - work let's
306:31 - wait
306:35 - okay so here you can see uh the output
306:38 - in the XML
306:39 - format
306:41 - nice okay so moving forward uh what I
306:44 - will
306:45 - do uh I will use some other function uh
306:48 - not function I will use some other uh
306:51 - options in which we can like uh create a
306:55 - one file in which we will add some
306:56 - domain names and then we will call that
306:58 - file and use this particular command
307:01 - what I'm just trying to say you uh let
307:03 - me create one file so just remember how
307:06 - you can create file in Linux we will
307:09 - just use Dutch
307:12 - command okay I will
307:15 - enter
307:17 - domain. dxt and I will write first
307:22 - google.com
307:26 - facebook.com
307:28 - instagram.com okay that's enough contr D
307:31 - to save okay let me check the content of
307:33 - this file not files. text what was the
307:35 - name domain yeah okay here is the domain
307:39 - uh now I will use MTR I will use hyphen
307:41 - f capital F option and provide
307:47 - the
307:51 - uh domain.
307:54 - txt and then
307:56 - the just it I think that's
308:00 - it okay so here you can see we are
308:03 - getting result for
308:11 - google.com
308:17 - Okay so you can see the Ping request
308:20 - everything we can see here all the
308:26 - statistics okay now further we will see
308:28 - how we can set the Ping okay so like uh
308:32 - normally what happens it sends approx 10
308:35 - P request okay like 1 to
308:39 - 10 okay if we want for only five how we
308:42 - can do
308:44 - MTR hyph
308:46 - C5
308:50 - google.com this is third fourth and the
308:53 - last one is fifth that's it so only five
308:57 - packets has been sent
308:59 - okay okay uh yeah again so here you can
309:03 - see this is a percentage loss here we
309:05 - can see the maximum percentage loss we
309:08 - don't know why and the
309:11 - sent okay wait a minute I have to just
309:15 - explain some things that's why so this
309:18 - is the last the average time this is the
309:20 - best time the what what time I'm trying
309:22 - to tell you like this is the round trip
309:24 - time like uh when the packet goes from
309:27 - the source to destination and then the
309:29 - packet uh like the rece sender receives
309:32 - the response from the receiver like that
309:35 - time that is a round trip time okay so
309:37 - this is the average best worst and this
309:39 - is the standard
309:41 - deviation
309:43 - okay latency something uh this is the
309:46 - last
309:47 - one so guys that's all for this video
309:50 - and I hope you liked it and if you have
309:53 - any query then please ask us in the
309:54 - comment section so thank you thank you
309:56 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
310:01 - video
310:02 - now in this particular video we are
310:04 - going to learn about host command okay
310:06 - so basically this command is used for
310:08 - the DNS lookup it basically means you
310:11 - are going to find information about the
310:13 - DNS servers as well the IP addresses of
310:15 - a domain name or uh or domain name with
310:20 - IP address you can say so but before
310:22 - moving forward in this particular video
310:24 - you should know the basics of domain
310:26 - name server okay so this is basically
310:29 - one of the networking Concept in which
310:32 - uh we will learn okay the following
310:34 - topics like actually have written
310:36 - already one blog on DNS so you can go
310:39 - and learn from this infosec writeups and
310:42 - if you will search for all about DNS 100
310:45 - days of hacking you will get it let me
310:47 - search it for
310:52 - you infos SEC
310:57 - writeups okay so this is the first one
311:00 - write up by awarma okay you can get it
311:02 - from
311:03 - here so uh let me tell you the basic
311:06 - idea of what is this domain name server
311:08 - and all these things so basically DNS
311:11 - stands for domain name server okay it
311:14 - means the whatever the your google.com
311:18 - it is a domain name it will get
311:20 - converted into the IP address or vice
311:22 - versa or IP address will get converted
311:24 - into the domain name so the main reason
311:28 - behind this is domain name service why
311:30 - this domain name server came in a role
311:33 - okay so just think like a normal human
311:36 - if you uh you are given a one address
311:39 - like
311:40 - 192.168
311:43 - 4235 whether uh this is easily remember
311:46 - easy to remember or google.com is easy
311:49 - to remember okay just think once so
311:51 - obviously you will say like sir
311:53 - google.com is easy to remember that's
311:55 - why that is the main reason behind this
311:57 - of DNS that's why it came in a role so
312:00 - we will see the basically working of how
312:02 - it basically Works uh let me move
312:05 - down as said you can see the I have WR
312:09 - like in more explanation I have given
312:11 - here you can learn it and also how it
312:15 - works I will tell you and this is a
312:17 - domain high like root level domain top
312:19 - level domain second level domain like do
312:22 - com. government
312:24 - do mil these are the root label domains
312:27 - okay and try hack me Google USA
312:30 - subdomains
312:32 - okay so you can learn all about these
312:34 - things and now let's moving forward to
312:36 - the working of
312:38 - uh this DNS okay so whenever user types
312:42 - in web address this
312:44 - particular domain name what happen in
312:46 - this case it will first do the DNS query
312:49 - from where DNS resolver okay DNS
312:52 - resolver is also one of the part of this
312:54 - particular process where some records
312:57 - are stored now next what will happen it
312:59 - will send the request to this root
313:01 - server whether if the dominium end
313:04 - with.com or do anything then it will
313:06 - move to the root server it will ask for
313:07 - do you have this IP address of this
313:10 - particular domain if it will say yes
313:12 - then it will forward the
313:13 - request then again in fourth step it
313:16 - will go with the TLD server and again
313:18 - with author name server and after that
313:22 - it will go to the main server of that
313:24 - particular website after getting the IP
313:27 - address okay so this is the overall
313:28 - working of this domain name server and
313:32 - now we will talk about the what are the
313:34 - records in DNS okay so basically DNS
313:37 - records provide the information about
313:39 - the particular domain so I will like go
313:44 - down and let me tell you the records
313:46 - okay so these are the basically some of
313:49 - the records like a records this four a
313:52 - records MX records CM record you can
313:54 - learn about these all things like a
313:56 - records provide us the ipv4 addresses
313:58 - and triaa and also one more a that is a
314:01 - 4 a record provide us the IP V6 address
314:04 - MX records provide us the like Mail
314:07 - Exchange address CM record is also
314:10 - provides like a like it points the
314:12 - subdomain to the main domain basically
314:14 - if there is a uh gmail. google.com or
314:18 - google.com both will point to the only
314:20 - single domain or not domain single IP
314:22 - addresses
314:24 - okay now moving this is the name server
314:27 - record that is NS records okay and TT
314:30 - record is some kind of record that that
314:32 - admin stored some kind of text and all
314:34 - these things okay now let's move to the
314:37 - our main motive of this particular video
314:39 - that is the host command
314:41 - okay so I hope you got to learn about
314:43 - all those things about DS
314:45 - records I hope it is visible to you let
314:48 - me just increase the size first so that
314:50 - it will be easy
314:52 - to it will be easily visible
314:55 - okay so now let's enter the host and
314:59 - just provide the
315:00 - google.com
315:02 - okay wait a
315:04 - [Music]
315:06 - minute okay uh let's see I'm getting
315:08 - some kind of
315:14 - error okay
315:18 - host
315:21 - google.com Okay google.com not found why
315:26 - like this
315:30 - post okay it's
315:38 - working okay let me provide another IP
315:42 - another domain name like uh let me
315:44 - provide
315:47 - Gmail not. go yeah
315:51 - do who gmail.com not found okay why this
315:55 - is happening I'm not
315:59 - getting let me do first ping whether
316:01 - it's working or
316:03 - not okay temporary failure in name
316:08 - resolution let me ping another some
316:10 - domum that is
316:12 - a
316:14 - uh which dominium should
316:18 - I let me check here medium.com let me
316:24 - do
316:27 - medium.com why it's happening I'm not
316:29 - getting uh let me uh restart my this
316:31 - Ubuntu machine so that after it may be
316:36 - uh work let me
316:38 - do okay now I have started restarting my
316:41 - PC uh let me now perform the that
316:45 - command okay so I hope it is visible to
316:47 - you uh let's do host
316:53 - google.com Okay so here you can see the
316:56 - address of google.com that is uh that is
316:58 - the ipv4 address what does ipv4 address
317:00 - mean it means that it is a like uh 32bit
317:03 - itus I guess okay if I'm not wrong uh
317:07 - let me check why to create confusion for
317:09 - you guys okay IP
317:12 - address
317:14 - bit size okay I hope it is 32 yeah I was
317:18 - correct okay it's 32 bits address it
317:21 - ranges from 0 to 20
317:25 - 0225 okay so here you can see the IP
317:28 - addresses of google.com that is 172.2
317:30 - 1727 .26 and again with the with same
317:34 - like you will get this IPv6 addresses
317:36 - that this is the like version 6
317:39 - addresses of google.com and the mail
317:41 - server address that is SM
317:43 - SMTP now what will happen if you will
317:46 - think about the concept of DNS what is
317:49 - happening here is uh when you are
317:51 - entering
317:52 - google.com so that domain is mapped with
317:55 - this particular IP address this one uh
317:59 - let me copy this IP address and and uh
318:02 - let me put it here what will happen
318:05 - whether it will go onto the google.com
318:08 - or not let's
318:13 - check okay damn so here you can see that
318:16 - that IP address is mapped to the
318:19 - google.com that's why uh like we are
318:22 - going on this particular domain name
318:25 - what will happen if I will I will just
318:28 - change it 206 to 25 whether it will go
318:31 - to the same or different let's check
318:34 - okay it's going to the
318:35 - same because that whole IP address may
318:39 - be belonging to that particular
318:42 - google.com let me do
318:45 - two okay it's same okay so now uh let's
318:49 - go for some another domain also host uh
318:53 - let's go with
318:55 - medium.com like sometimes it happens
318:57 - like uh you can't go on a particular
319:01 - okay I press something like print
319:05 - okay when sometimes what happens when
319:08 - you enter the uh IP address of some of
319:10 - the domain then at that time you will
319:12 - not be able to reach that particular
319:13 - domain because of firewall
319:16 - implementation and
319:18 - all so here also you can see different
319:21 - IP addresses mail servers okay so let me
319:24 - check this
319:25 - one 153 do
319:30 - 4
319:33 - okay let's check whether it goes or not
319:35 - okay so yeah here you can see the direct
319:37 - IP address not allowed why because I
319:40 - think they're using Cloud
319:42 - flare Cloud flare they using yes your IP
319:46 - here I will get my IP address
319:49 - okay so sometimes it doesn't allow okay
319:53 - now moving forward uh in this particular
319:56 - video with the getting the DNS records
319:59 - of a particular domain name okay
320:02 - so how you can get it like uh using Hy
320:06 - option we can get and also if you want
320:09 - to get only the IPv6 address you can get
320:12 - if it is
320:15 - available so here you can see connection
320:17 - is refused now let's check with the CM
320:20 - decord okay so if you don't know about
320:22 - CM decord you can go here and learn
320:24 - about it on this particular block okay
320:29 - what is see these record forward one
320:31 - domain or subdomain to another domain
320:33 - for example you can see blog.
320:35 - example.com has a CNM record with a
320:37 - value of example.com This Means whenever
320:40 - DNS record hits the DNS record for blog.
320:42 - example it actually triggers another DNS
320:46 - lookup to which domain that is the
320:48 - example domain and it basically Returns
320:51 - the IP of the same that is main domain
320:54 - example.com domain
320:57 - okay so uh let's do the DNS lookup for
321:01 - this particular record that is which one
321:03 - cm
321:04 - record so the command is very simple
321:07 - host hyph T cm and you have to just
321:10 - write any domain which you want let's do
321:12 - with
321:14 - google.com Okay it has no any
321:17 - record uh maybe it will be for medium
321:21 - let's
321:22 - check okay no
321:25 - records uh any website
321:30 - uh
321:32 - okay let me search
321:35 - for random
321:39 - colleges in
321:42 - Delhi if I get any college website now
321:45 - let's go with the
321:54 - 6.com copy
321:58 - it and just paste it here
322:07 - okay so here we are getting
322:10 - the okay not
322:12 - found
322:15 - okay okay so these sites are not having
322:17 - any CM record let's go with some another
322:20 - record uh let me check with MX record
322:23 - that is M ex it should be there yeah it
322:26 - has a mix record let's go
322:28 - for uh Google medium
322:35 - yeah they are using MX cord okay and
322:39 - let's check for another record that is a
322:41 - txt
322:44 - record okay we are getting it here all
322:47 - those
322:48 - records uh let's check
322:51 - for okay another website that is s hant
322:55 - txt
322:59 - record okay we getting all those
323:01 - information whatever the text is stored
323:04 - in this particular text file in the DNS
323:07 - course okay so I hope you like this
323:10 - particular video and uh today we will
323:11 - stop here and the next video we will
323:13 - learn about something new okay so that's
323:14 - all for today's video and if you have
323:16 - any query then please ask us in the
323:17 - comment section so thank you thank you
323:19 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
323:20 - video thank
323:23 - you hello guys now in this particular
323:25 - video we are going to cover the if
323:27 - config command basically it stands for
323:28 - interface configurator okay basically in
323:30 - this particular video we will be doing
323:32 - like changing the IP addresses and all
323:34 - those things and also this command
323:36 - basically we use is to find the IP
323:38 - address and the MAC address of
323:39 - particular machine so before starting
323:41 - what is a MAC address so Mac address is
323:43 - nothing but a particular 48 bit address
323:45 - which we use to identify a particular
323:47 - device on a particular Network okay so
323:50 - basically this Mac address is printed on
323:54 - your Nic that is the ni is a one of the
323:56 - card which attached to your to your
323:58 - computer or to your laptop then at this
324:01 - Mac address is like written hardcoded
324:05 - okay so let's start with our video so I
324:07 - will just hit uh if config so here you
324:11 - can see uh I'm getting different
324:12 - interfaces like EMP 03 and Local Host
324:16 - and at this point of time I'm getting
324:18 - this IP address this is provided by uh
324:20 - virtual box and this is the IPv6 address
324:23 - and this is the my Mac address okay so
324:27 - don't worry I've Chang it okay and this
324:30 - was interfaces for the Local Host okay
324:33 - so uh basically this uh command provides
324:36 - us what information you can see here the
324:38 - ipv4 address IPv6 and the MAC address
324:43 - okay so moving forward uh if you want to
324:46 - uh get the information of particular
324:48 - interface how you can do it if config
324:51 - and just write the interface name that
324:52 - is EMP 0
324:54 - S3 okay here you can see the only uh
324:57 - like information about a single
324:59 - interface okay what is the interface
325:01 - just like uh suppose if you are
325:04 - connected to a VPN then another
325:06 - interface will be created okay so it
325:08 - just provides us the IP address of a
325:10 - particular Network in which through to
325:12 - which you are connected and
325:14 - all okay so moving forward uh if you
325:17 - want to change your IP address how you
325:18 - can do it so this command basically
325:21 - provides us this functionality also
325:23 - another command is IP Command which we
325:25 - will cover in our next video okay which
325:28 - which is similarly used for these
325:30 - purposes
325:31 - so first let's uh change the IP address
325:35 - of this particular command that is if
325:37 - config and the interface name but before
325:39 - I will need to copy this interface
325:42 - name okay so let me clear the screen if
325:48 - config if
325:50 - config uh interface name and then I will
325:54 - uh provide an IP address let's to
325:58 - 192.168 do uh uh dot
326:04 - uh
326:06 - 25.0 and net Marx we will
326:09 - provide like this uh determines the
326:11 - number of machines which will be there
326:14 - on the network okay operation permitted
326:16 - why because we have not used Pudo so to
326:18 - change these uh things we we need a Pudo
326:22 - permission okay I will enter just
326:26 - password I hope I type wrong password
326:29 - yeah
326:32 - now it
326:34 - should okay let me try it
326:37 - again yeah done now again I will check
326:40 - the IP address if if config and M here
326:44 - you can see the particular IP addresses
326:46 - and netm okay so that's all for this
326:48 - particular video and we'll meet in the
326:49 - next video with another most amazing
326:51 - command so if you have any query then
326:52 - please ask in the comment section guys
326:54 - so thank you and thank you for watching
326:55 - we'll meet in the next
326:57 - one hello guys now in this particular
326:59 - video we are going to learn about the IP
327:01 - Command okay so this is similar to the
327:03 - IP config if config command okay so in
327:07 - this particular video we are going to
327:08 - learn about this so let's me open up the
327:10 - terminal
327:12 - and let me just increase the font size
327:15 - okay I hope it is visible to
327:17 - you and the command is just IP and you
327:20 - have to provide just one option that is
327:21 - a or a this one double Dr okay so this
327:25 - will give you the IP addresses of each
327:28 - interface that is this is a local host
327:31 - and second one is my this one interface
327:33 - EMP 0 S3 and my Mac address is there
327:36 - which is provided by
327:38 - the which what we say virtual box and
327:42 - this one is the IP address okay so uh
327:46 - now moving forward uh if you want to get
327:49 - the on the ipv4 address so what can you
327:52 - type okay so IP hphone
327:56 - 4 and Just A Dr and here you go and now
328:02 - you have got the only ipv4 addresses not
328:05 - IPv6 but what if you want to get the ipv
328:08 - IPv6 address then what command you can
328:10 - do IP hyph
328:13 - 6 address okay so here you can see this
328:16 - is the uh IP V6 address it means IP
328:21 - version 6 address okay so basically
328:23 - there are the two types of addresses
328:24 - that is a IP version 4 and version six
328:27 - and there are some differences between
328:28 - them uh like um uh differences in you
328:34 - can say on basis of bit size okay you
328:37 - can learn more about the differences
328:38 - between ipv4 and
328:40 - IPv6 and moving forward uh let me tell
328:44 - you about one more uh this option that
328:46 - is
328:48 - a IP address so de and interface if you
328:52 - want to get only information about some
328:54 - particular interface so I will go with
328:57 - this EMP z s
329:00 - three and here you can see the only
329:04 - result from this interface particular 0
329:08 - S3 let me clear the screen so that it
329:11 - will
329:12 - be more visible to you uh let me again
329:15 - run the command okay here you can see
329:18 - the interface is this
329:19 - one and here is the MAC address and the
329:23 - IP address okay so in this way you can
329:25 - get the IP address and Mac address of
329:28 - your system using this IP Command okay
329:31 - if you want to learn more you can just
329:33 - do man IP and here you will get the
329:36 - multiple options as you can see here
329:39 - hyph for human rable for hyph for stats
329:43 - so output more information if the cap
329:45 - option appears twice or more the amount
329:47 - of information increases okay so uh let
329:50 - me try hyph s IP hyph s let's see what
329:54 - happens okay uh what should I do now
330:01 - object equal to
330:03 - address okay uh let me check like
330:07 - this yeah here you can see we are
330:10 - getting now various records like many
330:13 - more
330:14 - information okay this is rx byes packet
330:17 - error drop missed any packet which is
330:19 - missed mcast so all these are showing
330:22 - here okay you with this option you can
330:25 - get more
330:26 - information again let's see some another
330:28 - option which we can use here here like
330:33 - um if you we let's use hyph
330:37 - R IP hyph R
330:40 - address okay so here you can see the
330:43 - information about uh dissolver
330:46 - name and 6 I virtual box 64 scop link
330:50 - this
330:51 - is okay so uh that's all for today's

331:04 - this particular video we are going to
331:06 - learn about the who is command okay so
331:08 - basically this is the command line
331:09 - utility of one of the GUI based tool
331:11 - that is who is lookup okay so basically
331:14 - we use this particular uh command to
331:17 - find the information about a particular
331:19 - domain name as for example
331:21 - google.com or the IP
331:24 - address okay so this is the basically
331:28 - command which we will use and and uh
331:30 - let's see what kind of information we
331:32 - can get about one particular domain name
331:34 - or particular IP address okay so first
331:37 - of all let me find the IP address of
331:40 - google.com Okay so here I'm getting this
331:42 - one I will just copy it how I can do it
331:45 - just uh control shift and c I will just
331:49 - now hit contrl C
331:52 - to to stop this ping command okay now
331:55 - who is okay so now you will see this
331:59 - command is not not found why not found
332:01 - because it's not installed in our system
332:03 - that's why it's not found okay so just
332:05 - copy it okay paste it this is the AP
332:10 - install who is this is a command to
332:11 - install any package you
332:15 - want okay let it
332:18 - install okay done done done
332:23 - yeah okay I think now it's done it will
332:27 - take some time just wait okay now done
332:30 - let me clear the screen let me again
332:31 - type who is okay yeah uh yeah I can do
332:35 - uh like I am able to learn run this
332:38 - command okay now so here you can see
332:40 - there are many flags available to use
332:42 - this command that is host Port I for
332:47 - query who is I and follows its referral
332:50 - okay so now what we will do let's hit
332:54 - this one who is and first let's check
332:56 - for DNS only like for domain names okay
333:00 - so now here you can see multiple
333:02 - information about this domain google.com
333:05 - let me clear this screen and again let
333:07 - me show you the
333:09 - whole information about
333:11 - google.com so here you can see the
333:14 - domain name is google.com their ID is
333:17 - this who which server is this their URL
333:20 - is this like from where they have
333:22 - registered or what register
333:25 - URL and updated date you can see it's 99
333:28 - 2019 expiry date is
333:32 - 4928 okay so name server is this one NS
333:36 - one. google.com ns2 and so
333:39 - on and moving
333:41 - forward and here you can see
333:44 - the creation date all those things
333:48 - okay and admin organization who is the
333:52 - admin of this particular domain that is
333:53 - Google LLC is the admin as we all know
333:57 - country us yeah we know it
334:00 - andtime we don't get this email because
334:03 - suppose you buy a domain name from go go
334:05 - id.com okay so they take some some fees
334:09 - to you to keep your information
334:11 - safe okay so no one should access those
334:15 - information like your mail ID your
334:16 - password uh not password your phone
334:18 - number and all those
334:21 - things okay so in this way you can get
334:24 - the information about uh any particular
334:27 - domain name okay now uh let me again
334:29 - check with
334:31 - uh with the IP address whether I'm able
334:34 - to perform this not let me just copy
334:37 - this IP address again oh wait okay
334:41 - yeah 142k
334:43 - 250 okay let me clear this
334:47 - screen who is and the particular IP
334:50 - address and we are done okay so here's
334:53 - the all the results so net range is this
334:56 - 142. 250 do not do not to this range
334:59 - okay okay so IP addresses can be between
335:02 - this CID is this sl5 so if you want to
335:05 - learn more about CID I have actually uh
335:08 - write a blog on it you can search for it
335:10 - like submitting infos writeups if you'll
335:13 - search then you will get okay then
335:16 - Google parent all these information you
335:18 - can get
335:20 - okay so basically where uh you will
335:22 - think about where uh you need this
335:25 - particular command what is the use of
335:26 - this basically if you go in the testing
335:28 - field or penetration test testing or
335:30 - cyber security fi and then there is a
335:32 - phase of information gathering so in
335:34 - this particular phase we use it okay so
335:37 - that's why I'm telling
335:38 - you okay so uh let me uh search for some
335:43 - more information like f is what are the
335:47 - things we can check here who is hyphen
335:51 - keyword description
335:57 - okay okay if you will use hyphen a to
335:59 - search for all the mirror
336:02 - databases brief iy addresses with abuse
336:06 - contact okay show the email
336:10 - addresses okay uh let me try with hyphen
336:13 - B okay let's check what
336:15 - happens who is hyb
336:22 - google.com okay here you can see we are
336:24 - getting some kind of uh email address
336:28 - okay uh let me again uh
336:31 - like uh use this command and I will not
336:33 - use hyphen B option so so that we can uh
336:37 - get the difference okay so what was the
336:39 - command I had entered
336:41 - here who is hyphen B okay now I will
336:44 - just use who
336:45 - is
336:49 - google.com Okay
336:53 - so here you can see uh I think we are
336:56 - not getting any uh mail address here but
336:59 - here you can see admin email okay but
337:03 - here I am getting one address that is
337:06 - brjb someone's address it
337:08 - is

337:26 - video thank you thank you so
337:28 - much in this particular video we are
337:30 - going to learn about the NS lookup
337:32 - command okay so basically this command
337:34 - used to find the like information about
337:37 - the DNS records okay
337:39 - so previously in the host command we
337:41 - have find the DNS records and already we
337:44 - have covered what is the domain name
337:45 - server like it is used to change the uh
337:49 - domain name to the IP address and vice
337:50 - versa and also various DNS cords like uh
337:54 - CM record we have covered and txt record
337:58 - a record and for a record we have
338:02 - covered okay so many records we have
338:04 - covered till now and we will use this NS
338:06 - Lo command to uh get uh information
338:09 - about these particular
338:11 - records okay so let's start with the
338:13 - first basic
338:15 - one just start with
338:18 - google.com Okay let me close this caps
338:21 - lock and let's look up
338:24 - google.com Okay done here you can see
338:26 - the address that is this is ipv4 address
338:29 - and this this is IPv6 address okay so uh
338:32 - you can uh like what we say use
338:36 - this like this also you can use and look
338:39 - of hyph type equal to it means you are
338:42 - just defining the what type of record
338:44 - you want okay it may be a record okay
338:47 - let's search for a record iPhone type A
338:49 - and just provide the domain name and
338:53 - here you will get the
338:54 - address okay so in this you are getting
338:56 - this uh let me search for another domain
338:58 - name uh let's take some another domain
339:01 - name what should we
339:03 - take uh I'm not
339:06 - getting okay
339:09 - facebook.com okay so here you can see
339:11 - this is the particular IP address of
339:14 - facebook.com and this is for google.com
339:18 - so let me uh just uh copy
339:21 - this IP address and paste it in the
339:24 - browser whether we can access it or
339:28 - not let me just paste it
339:31 - here okay I think I not copied
339:37 - it okay just copy
339:40 - it and I will just open up
339:45 - the okay here I will paste it let's say
339:48 - whether it is accessible or not
339:50 - google.com with this IP address okay so
339:53 - it is accessible and similarly we will
339:56 - try for our this one
340:01 - facebook.com I don't think it will be
340:05 - accessible but still let's
340:12 - try okay it's showing not
340:16 - recommended I will accept the risk let's
340:19 - see what
340:21 - happens
340:24 - is I hope you have watched a
340:28 - scam okay okay so here you can see uh we
340:32 - are on this facebook.com page okay means
340:35 - we can uh go on this particular page
340:38 - using IP
340:41 - address okay so U moving forward uh if
340:44 - you want to get the record of like 4 a
340:46 - record like a a a a and a okay I hope
340:51 - I counted
340:56 - five okay so here will you can see
341:01 - the version 6 like IPv6 address of
341:04 - facebook.com now let's try some another
341:07 - record for another domain uh let me
341:09 - check for a record for some other
341:12 - another domain like I will now I will go
341:14 - for uh
341:17 - YouTube okay here you can see the IP
341:20 - address of YouTube I we know it may be
341:22 - accessible or not accessible using IP
341:24 - address okay that particular domain so
341:27 - now moving forward to the different
341:28 - records so we will search for
341:31 - the uh txt
341:34 - record okay let's search for
341:36 - txt hyph type equal to txt youtube.com
341:42 - Okay so here you can see this is the
341:44 - Google side verification some kind of
341:45 - text is
341:47 - stored okay and uh if I go with some
341:52 - different domain name like
341:56 - Facebook okay let's check okay
342:00 - these are the
342:03 - texts okay let's check for some another
342:05 - domain
342:07 - also I will just check for
342:12 - google.com okay here you can see
342:13 - different
342:15 - different like many texts are present
342:19 - there
342:21 - atlassian want domain verification okay
342:24 - many things are there and now moving
342:26 - forward let's check for the MX record
342:29 - that is the mail exchange record okay it
342:32 - it is basically we use it to like
342:34 - sending the mail or receiving the mail
342:36 - from from any sender okay so uh let's
342:42 - use it I will just uh change this from
342:46 - type to
342:48 - MX and this is you can see the mail
342:50 - exchange which is
342:58 - smtp.gmail.com for the small uh websites
343:02 - like let's take uh some let me search it
343:05 - search it for
343:07 - um I will open up Chrome
343:10 - here I think it this Firefox will take
343:14 - much time in
343:16 - this okay we are here just search for
343:22 - Linux
343:25 - commands Okay so let me take Java T
343:28 - Point okay
343:32 - yeah let me close this okay now I will
343:37 - use Java T point a
343:42 - record Java T
343:46 - point.com okay so here you can see this
343:48 - is the a record and here you can see two
343:51 - IP addresses are pointing to the same
343:53 - domain uh let me check I will just copy
343:56 - this IP
343:58 - address and I will put it in
344:02 - my browser let's check what happens
344:05 - whether it is accessible or not I don't
344:07 - know why it's not working
344:10 - of by directional copy paste is not here
344:13 - I think let me enable those setting yeah
344:17 - I think now it should
344:19 - work control shift
344:23 - C oh yeah now it's working okay so here
344:26 - you can see uh direct IP access is not
344:29 - allowed for javao let me check the
344:31 - another IP
344:32 - address it will be it will throw same
344:36 - error I think let's see what
344:38 - happens okay same same thing like direct
344:41 - IP access is not allowed so I hope you
344:43 - got it how you can find the different
344:45 - records using anx lookup commands so
344:47 - that's it for today's video and we'll
344:48 - meet in the next video with some amazing
344:50 - commands so thank you thank you for
344:52 - watching and we'll meet in the next one
344:53 - thank you particular video we're going
344:55 - to learn about the most interesting
344:56 - command that is the W gate command Okay
344:58 - so basic basically we use this command
345:00 - to uh download files from the servers or
345:03 - from any website suppose in case if you
345:05 - want to download any kind of PNG or you
345:08 - want to download any kind of PDF or uh
345:11 - you can say uh also if you want to
345:15 - mirror the website it means you want to
345:17 - download the whole website their whole
345:18 - file that is HTML CSS JavaScript all
345:21 - those file if you want to download okay
345:23 - so in this case you can uh do all those
345:25 - operations using this single command
345:27 - that is a w command
345:29 - okay so uh let's start now with the
345:31 - implementation part that is uh W get and
345:36 - the whatever the URL you want okay I'm
345:39 - just first I will give you the syntax so
345:41 - syntax is nothing but WG options and
345:45 - whatever the URL uh you want to provide
345:48 - it can be uh URL of any file or anything
345:50 - else okay so now moving forward uh what
345:54 - are the protocols that W command
345:56 - supports so it supports St TP stps that
346:01 - is a Hyer text transfer protocol
346:04 - secure and FTP file transfer protocol so
346:07 - these are the some protocols which are
346:09 - used by the WG command so HTTP runs on
346:12 - Port 80 sttp runs on Port 443 and FTP on
346:15 - Port
346:17 - 21 okay now moving forward uh let me
346:20 - increase the font size for so that it
346:21 - should it go it should be visible to you
346:23 - guys okay now now what I will do I will
346:27 - uh try to search for image
346:29 - I have already searched I think okay so
346:34 - Linux
346:37 - PNG uh let me copy this image address or
346:42 - uh let me do here also I will
346:47 - choose this one image okay let's take
346:50 - let me check open image in new
346:53 - trap uh
346:56 - okay m
347:00 - yeah this one is good copy image
347:04 - address and here W get and the oh my god
347:09 - let's let's see what happens let's see
347:13 - just file name is too long
347:16 - okay so let's take some another
347:19 - image
347:21 - uh okay let me search
347:26 - for from here I will choose
347:37 - okay
347:42 - okay I think this one should be no not
347:45 - this
347:49 - one open image in new
347:54 - tab
347:55 - okay copy image address
347:59 - now let's check so here right now I'm
348:02 - not providing any kind of options so it
348:04 - will just store my file in this current
348:06 - working directory but before I will just
348:08 - create a One Directory W get tutorial I
348:10 - will create okay I will move into that
348:14 - particular directory and I will again
348:15 - enter the command that is WG and the
348:19 - this one link so here you can see it is
348:22 - downloading my file okay now we'll do LS
348:24 - and here you can see my file has been
348:27 - downloaded okay now to uh see the image
348:30 - file uh there is a separate command that
348:32 - is a fee but it is um you need to
348:36 - install first you can do like Pudo
348:38 - AP install fee I know I don't know the
348:42 - pronunciation of this command but it can
348:44 - it could be f f something like that so
348:47 - you can see f is already newest version
348:49 - so now what I will do I will just F and
348:51 - the file name what it was I think L
348:54 - something yeah so you can see file has
348:56 - been downloaded okay cool now
348:59 - you can easily download the files it can
349:01 - be used in some kind of automation
349:03 - things okay if you want but manually we
349:06 - download files from our web web browser
349:08 - but in some cases we could we can use W
349:11 - command
349:13 - also so now moving forward uh we will
349:17 - uh see the uh like uh what like here you
349:22 - can see uh the name of the file is so
349:24 - big okay if you want to uh like like
349:28 - name it some different names okay I will
349:31 - then for that we use capital O that is
349:34 - hyph capital O option and then we will
349:37 - use the new name that I will provide
349:38 - this Linux PNG
349:41 - image okay and the
349:46 - URL let's
349:48 - check okay I will do LS and here you can
349:51 - see Linux PNG image I am not added. PNG

350:41 - it was a long string like theux Dux pen
350:44 - Vector graphic pixel Bay all those
350:47 - things but now we can easily change the
350:49 - name of that particular
350:52 - file okay so moving forward uh you can
350:57 - use the different options
350:58 - like hyphen P option to uh like uh save
351:02 - the file in a particular directory in
351:03 - which you want so I will go just move
351:07 - back one
351:08 - directory and uh no uh let me PWD I will
351:13 - do and I will just copy the whole path
351:15 - here
351:16 - first okay if I not copy uh doesn't
351:19 - matter let's now I'm in which directory
351:22 - I'm in this home iuse directory okay now
351:25 - what I will do I will just uh like like
351:28 - I want to save my file in this
351:31 - particular directory okay but before
351:34 - that I will just remove those
351:38 - files
351:41 - uh CDW
351:44 - get rone star okay it's not a star it's
351:50 - basically asri we say uh let me close
351:53 - this
351:54 - terminal now what do you want to do you
351:56 - have to just give the whole path of this
351:59 - particular like
352:01 - location so I will just provide
352:04 - this hyph p and this one and
352:10 - the link so I will just copy this one
352:15 - link okay done it should
352:19 - be yes so now I will move back into this
352:23 - directory W get I'll do LS and here you
352:26 - can see the same image okay we have
352:29 - downloaded so using hyph p option you
352:32 - can uh save your file into some
352:36 - another directory okay so now moving
352:40 - forward uh suppose uh there is some
352:43 - conditions like if you are downloading a
352:45 - multiple files or anything else and you
352:47 - have a limited bandwidth or limited
352:49 - internet connection or you can say
352:51 - limited net you have like these days we
352:54 - use 1.5 GB per days and all those things
352:57 - so in this case you want to limit your
353:00 - bandwidth or Internet like to like we we
353:03 - don't want to like w get to consume more
353:06 - amount of net okay so for this we use
353:10 - the uh hyphen hyphen limit hyphen rate
353:13 - option and we provide the what should be
353:16 - the minimum amount of the net used by
353:21 - this WG command so for this what we will
353:24 - do WG hyph iph limit hyph rate equal to
353:29 - 1 m 1 m means 1 MB 1 MB and K means KB
353:34 - and all okay and URL we will provide and
353:38 - let's now just uh use some different uh
353:44 - image not this one this one I was
353:47 - learning about how I can see the image
353:49 - okay this is not
353:52 - necessary
353:54 - okay move back move back uh
353:59 - let's download the

354:23 - image uh no I don't want this link let
354:26 - me open up this one
354:33 - open image and new
354:37 - tab
354:42 - okay uh if I will click on download
354:47 - free whether I will get some link or not
354:50 - if I will copy this one let's see what
354:53 - happens okay it's downloading now it
354:56 - means we have copied the
354:59 - correct link now what I will do I will
355:01 - just uh paste the
355:03 - URL and uh we are done and also I will
355:07 - provide the iPhone o option to change
355:10 - the file name iPhone capital
355:14 - O file name should be
355:19 - Spiderman PNG
355:23 - enter okay I'm getting some kind of
355:27 - error
355:29 - let me do contrl c
355:33 - LS something C get log let's see what's
355:38 - going
355:41 - on okay saving spider-man. PNG
355:45 - okay let me again run the program uh you
355:49 - can use hyphen C option to uh what we
355:52 - can say to
355:54 - resume uh hyphen C I think it's uh
356:00 - uh small C let me check and again I will
356:03 - just open up some another terminal to
356:06 - check the W get log file if I get the
356:10 - same error again CD W get URL
356:14 - LS and tail hyph F log okay and let me
356:21 - just again run this
356:24 - command
356:26 - okay
356:30 - redirecting output to W get hyphen log.
356:37 - one okay let me just contrl C and W get
356:42 - one it is I
356:43 - think LS
356:48 - uh to at do one okay connecting to
356:53 - oneplace.com so here you can see we can
356:56 - see the live uh whatever the background
356:59 - process is going on you we can see this
357:01 - like this using tail command Okay so w
357:05 - get command W get log basically provides
357:07 - a log okay whatever it's going
357:11 - on okay so I don't think it is getting
357:15 - connected I'm getting some kind of error
357:17 - maybe it could be network error let me
357:19 - just close the connection I will use
357:23 - some different
357:25 - uh different image not from
357:28 - unpl okay Wikipedia is there uh let me
357:32 - open image in new tab I need a short
357:35 - link
357:37 - just okay just search for Linux
357:42 - only okay this one let me
357:48 - check let me close all these
357:56 - sides
358:02 - okay let's move back I think it's taking
358:05 - so much
358:07 - time open image new
358:10 - time
358:15 - no Linux
358:26 - PNG okay it's still opening man how much
358:30 - time it will
358:31 - take uh let me pause the video
358:36 - uh okay so I was getting a network error
358:39 - at that time uh now it has been resolved
358:42 - so here you can see uh like the log file
358:45 - of this one wg. log. one okay so you can
358:48 - see the file is already fully retrived
358:51 - okay so uh now I will just check again
358:55 - so here you can see the image I think
358:56 - it's too large to display here okay
358:59 - that's why we are not able to see it so
359:03 - in this case if you want to limit your
359:05 - bandwidth you can use the limit hyph
359:07 - hyph uh hyph limit hyph rate equal to
359:11 - whatever the uh amount you want to give
359:14 - like uh it could be 1 MB 1 KB or
359:16 - anything it's all depends upon you and
359:18 - your internet
359:20 - connection and similarly using Hy C we
359:23 - just checked we can resume any uh like
359:26 - uh any download which is not complete or
359:29 - if uh like similarly I just got the
359:31 - network error so I can resume using hyph
359:35 - C
359:36 - option okay uh now moving forward uh if
359:39 - you want to download some file in the
359:42 - background
359:43 - process okay so in that time we use the
359:46 - hyphen B option that is this one hyphen
359:49 - B option we will use and uh also the WG
359:53 - log file will be created similarly like
359:55 - this like uh this one WG log and WG log.
359:59 - one okay similarly this file will be
360:01 - generated and we can see the whatever
360:04 - the process going on and all those
360:06 - things so now moving forward I will just
360:08 - download one PDF I will just search for
360:12 - us uh file type this is Linux uh Google
360:17 - docking we call it if you use this kind
360:19 - of searches uh file type I will just
360:22 - type
360:25 - uh let's type Linux
360:29 - PDF I hope my connection internet should
360:32 - work okay again I'm getting it I don't
360:35 - let me pause the
360:36 - video okay now I'm done uh now finally
360:39 - it's working let me just search for a
360:43 - file
360:44 - type I will just use a let's just SE
360:48 - similar like this file type
360:50 - PDF uh colon I just let me write the
360:53 - file name also so that it could be easy
360:57 - so so here you can see there is one PDF
360:59 - file introduction to Linux this one okay
361:02 - TLD dp.org this is some kind of I don't
361:06 - know which website is I will just copy

365:22 - one hello now in this particular video
365:25 - we are going to learn about the how we
365:26 - can miror a particular website or
365:28 - download a particular website you can
365:29 - say like that also so using WG command
365:32 - so already we have covered the first
365:34 - part of WG command and now in this
365:36 - particular video we will just mirror the
365:38 - website okay so what are the things we
365:41 - will be doing in this particular video
365:43 - so first of all we will miror the
365:44 - website and secondly we will just
365:46 - locally host the website using python
365:49 - okay and already the python installed in
365:51 - our one to PC okay this machine so these
365:54 - are the two things we will perform and
365:57 - let's start the implementation part so
365:59 - we will we will use the disate command
366:01 - and the some of the options the common
366:04 - option is use hyphen M but it is not
366:06 - suitable to browse that downloaded
366:08 - website locally so additionally we use
366:10 - some other options that is hyphen K and
366:14 - hyphen P option also to browse those
366:17 - website locally in a easy way okay and
366:19 - it downloads the website in a particular
366:21 - format you can SCT that okay so I have
366:25 - already selected this particular website
366:26 - you you can see uh this is a quite a
366:29 - good website and this is nothing but a
366:32 - free template from I've have got this
366:34 - from this html.
366:36 - design/ demo SL bird uh bird I am okay
366:41 - so you can uh do this uh you can also
366:44 - download this template or also any other
366:47 - okay so I'll just copy the URL and I
366:51 - will just paste it

367:00 - will just create One Directory uh mirror
367:05 - website okay CD mirror
367:10 - website okay and now here I will use
367:13 - those
367:16 - particular this one command okay so now

367:22 - the images it is fetching and here you
367:24 - can see contact. HTML images just bird
367:27 - lion deer Dove anything whatever is the
367:30 - images and all those things it is

367:36 - it should take 3 to 4 minutes of time as
367:41 - uh website is not quite uh long like it
367:46 - should not take much
367:49 - time okay so here you can see it has
367:52 - faced multiple files you can see

376:28 - done so this is the website locally okay
376:33 - you can see all the same design same
376:36 - color everything is there okay now you
376:39 - can if you want to uh
376:41 - like uh edit this website you can easily
376:44 - do okay so there also another method to
376:48 - mirror a website but it was related to W
376:51 - get that's why I told you about this
376:52 - particular feature I will go to about
376:55 - us uh yeah it's working I
376:58 - think okay now it is not linked I think
377:01 - about is not linked okay okay no
377:05 - problem so in this way you can mirror a
377:08 - particular website I hope you liked it
377:10 - and you can like match the things like
377:12 - everything is similar okay so in this
377:16 - way you can mirror a particular website
377:18 - if you want so I hope you liked it and
377:21 - that's all for today's video I and we
377:24 - will meet in the next video with some
377:25 - another another amazing command so guys
377:28 - if you have any queries so please ask in
377:30 - the comment sections and thank you for
377:32 - watching we'll meet in the next one
377:34 - thank you thank you so
377:36 - much particular video we are going to
377:38 - learn about the SS command okay so
377:41 - basically this command we use to connect
377:43 - to the remote machines or if you're not
377:45 - aware of remote machine then let me tell
377:47 - you first what is a remote machine so
377:49 - basically this is the concept of cloud
377:51 - computing in which uh when you use a
377:54 - machine this is just like a similar
377:56 - machine but we access it remotely okay
378:00 - that will be the similar machine like
378:01 - your PC and the same operating system
378:04 - will be there okay and it will be Linux
378:07 - or it can
378:08 - be Windows OS okay so basically that
378:12 - particular instance or that particular
378:15 - machine is stored in the data center of
378:17 - different Cloud providers if you are
378:19 - using AWS then Amazon Amazon data center
378:22 - will be there if you're using Azo then U
378:26 - Microsoft cloud data center will be
378:28 - there and in case of Google then Google
378:30 - uh data center will be there okay so
378:34 - basically what we are going to perform
378:36 - in this particular video so first of all
378:38 - I will create a virtual machine in Azure
378:41 - you can also do it because it's free and
378:43 - using sandbox you can uh like you get 1
378:47 - hour exess of the Azure portal so you
378:50 - can go on this particular link or you
378:53 - can just search for create a VM using
378:55 - Azure portal then you will get this link
378:56 - and you will just need to login using
378:58 - your Microsoft account so I'll just
379:01 - activate sandbox it will take some time
379:03 - just wait for
379:05 - it okay but uh uh let me tell you first
379:09 - like uh SSH command so what port it uses
379:12 - so basically SSS command uses port
379:15 - number 22 okay so now this processes uh
379:21 - going on and in this particular this
379:23 - article you can learn about how you can
379:25 - create a the virtual machine also if
379:27 - you're interested
379:33 - okay so now 91
379:37 - 92 yeah okay and you have to just go
379:41 - there and click on this as your
379:47 - portal
379:51 - okay okay now here this here is the
379:54 - Azure portal you can easily uh create
379:57 - virtual machines in this just click on
379:58 - this virtual
380:00 - machine okay so I will just click on
380:03 - it and you have to just uh click on
380:08 - create as your virtual
380:13 - machine okay so here you can see the
380:16 - resource code you have to select just
380:18 - this learn and virtual machine name I
380:20 - will just use Linux VM and this is the
380:24 - open to server we are going to use in
380:26 - our case this is a image it means which
380:29 - operating system you are going to use so
380:30 - here you can see choose the base
380:32 - operating system or applicate applicable
380:34 - for the VM so we already it is selected
380:37 - that is UB to server you can also select
380:40 - different OS like uh windows and all for
380:42 - Windows we use RDP okay so now here you
380:46 - can see uh if you are going with s s
380:48 - public key then it will create a PM file
380:51 - but right now we are not going with it
380:52 - we are going uh with a simple way that
380:55 - that is a password so I will just
380:57 - provide a password that is aush and I
380:59 - will provide a
381:04 - username
381:10 - okay okay matching now s s such Port is
381:13 - there you can enable HTTP also it's all
381:17 - your choice okay now
381:21 - next and here you don't have to do any
381:24 - kind of changes no changes you have to
381:26 - do
381:27 - okay so you can directly just click on
381:30 - review plus create
381:33 - okay so basically the main purpose of
381:36 - this video is to show just show you the
381:38 - working of SSH command Okay so one uh
381:42 - this my scine is deployed and I can show
381:45 - you
381:46 - easily okay so here you can see
381:48 - validation pass it means you have done
381:50 - all the things correctly you have to
381:52 - just click on create
381:54 - here
382:04 - okay initializing deployment let's
382:07 - wait it will take approx I think 2 to 3
382:10 - minutes of time and basically this video
382:13 - will be the first part and our next part
382:15 - we will cover some different things in
382:18 - SSH like how we can share files and all
382:20 - those
382:24 - things
382:26 - okay deployment is in progress let's
382:29 - [Music]
382:37 - wait okay it's going on here you can see
382:39 - the all the steps or whatever it is uh
382:43 - performing okay like Linux IP VM
382:50 - NSG okay it will take approx 2 minute of
382:54 - time now yeah yeah Linux VM is now it is
382:57 - getting
383:01 - created let's
383:12 - [Music]
383:17 - wait
383:20 - okay you can skip this part in the video
383:24 - like you can fast forward
383:28 - word now it's done just uh one
383:31 - confirmation should come yeah your
383:33 - deployment is complete uh you have to
383:35 - just click on this go to
383:38 - Resource
383:42 - okay yeah
383:45 - uh let's wait asent is not ready why not
383:51 - ready troubleshoot the
383:54 - issue okay okay I'm not getting why it's
383:57 - not
383:58 - ready let me just click on
384:05 - this VM extension
384:12 - issues no issue found okay okay no issue
384:16 - found uh let me just
384:19 - uh
384:21 - uh yeah IP address is visible to me I
384:24 - hope now I can uh do so here you can see
384:29 - the IP address of this Linux VM machine
384:32 - and I know the my username and
384:34 - password so I will use this SSH command
384:43 - okay and uh
384:46 - SSH and the username is whatever iush at
384:50 - theate and the IP which you have copied
384:54 - enter
384:57 - okay so here it asking are you sure you
384:59 - want to continue yeah I'm absolutely Dam
385:02 - sure click on
385:05 - yes okay so we have to just type the
385:13 - password I hope I entered correct
385:17 - password okay done so here you can see
385:21 - iuse Linux VM is the username and uh is
385:25 - the host name of that PC or ubu machine
385:28 - and this is aush okay so you can see
385:30 - this is not my Ubuntu machine okay you
385:34 - can clear the screen if I to LS so here
385:37 - it is nothing okay so if I will just uh
385:42 - create one
385:43 - file uh let me create uh
385:48 - cat test.txt
385:51 - uh leave I will not create one file let
385:54 - me just install all the one Apachi
385:56 - server in this sudo AP uh get
386:01 - install Apachi 2 so it is basically a
386:03 - web server we use to host web
386:05 - application
386:07 - so okay so just click uh hit
386:12 - enter okay why it's not
386:18 - working I don't know why it's not
386:20 - working let's
386:24 - check I will just close this terminal
386:26 - again I will connect uh I hope that
386:29 - connection has been
386:31 - lost okay SSH the
386:34 - username and the
386:37 - IP okay IP is not getting printed let's
386:41 - me check what is the IP here this
386:44 - one
386:47 - okay not I don't want HTTP something
386:51 - like that just remove all those
386:53 - things enter
386:58 - okay the
387:03 - password
387:05 - okay so now I'm this machine I'll just
387:11 - install Apache server Apache 2 hit enter
387:16 - yeah do you want to continue yes click
387:19 - on
387:20 - yes now here you can see the Apache
387:22 - server is uh installing
387:26 - this is not my Linux machine like you
387:29 - will think like this is my Ubuntu
387:30 - machine
387:31 - okay so Apachi 2 is getting okay okay uh
387:36 - after uh creating the server you will
387:39 - see the default page of
387:43 - apachi okay we are done and I will just
387:45 - reload okay so automatically here you
387:48 - can see the Apachi server uh default
387:51 - page is displaying okay so uh let me
387:55 - change this uh like I will just change
387:58 - the permission of one folder that is
388:02 - uh not
388:04 - 70077 and the folder is war
388:09 - www HTML basically this is the directory
388:12 - where your index. HTML file is stored I
388:16 - use sudo now
388:18 - okay and now let's move back into those
388:22 - directories I will just use CD do do
388:26 - slash
388:28 - LS again CD do do SL LS I will move into
388:34 - the
388:35 - war
388:36 - www
388:39 - HTML okay now we do LS here you will see
388:43 - there is nothing I will just
388:46 - create index. HTML and I will okay
388:50 - permission denied I will use
388:53 - sudo
388:55 - okay again it's permission is denied
388:58 - okay lsph
389:01 - L CH mode
389:07 - 77 operation not permitted let's use
389:12 - Pudo okay now I can edit this index.html
389:17 - file okay I will use this body and the
389:21 - H1 tag I will use this is is
389:27 - a tutorial based on SSH
389:36 - by
389:39 - aush okay and just close this body tag
389:45 - control D to save and just reload this
389:51 - page okay so you are done here you can
389:53 - see this is tutorial based on SSH by I
389:57 - so I hope you um got to learn about
389:59 - different things in this particular
390:01 - video like how you can create VMS in uh
390:04 - Azure Azure okay and also how you can
390:09 - uh uh install Apache server in your
390:12 - remote machine and the most important
390:15 - thing SSH command how you can connect so
390:18 - in our next video we will use different
390:20 - commands to uh we will see how we can
390:22 - upload files from our uh like this local
390:25 - machine to this machine but
390:31 - sorry
390:33 - sorry uh but we will use uh like
390:37 - different server okay like tomorrow we
390:40 - will use E2 server of Amazon okay but
390:43 - because uh this machine will get uh like
390:48 - uh out of network in 1 hour okay not in
390:52 - even 1 hour it will take uh
390:55 - approx 35 minutes will be remaining okay
390:58 - 42 minute okay so thank you guys for
391:01 - watching this video and I hope you liked
391:03 - it and got to learn about new things so
391:05 - we will meet in the next video so
391:07 - bye-bye and we'll meet in next one thank
391:09 - you for watching hello guys now in this
391:11 - particular video we're going to learn
391:12 - about the SCP command okay so basically
391:14 - this command is used to copy the files
391:16 - from one host to the another host that
391:18 - is uh in our previous video uh we had
391:21 - created the virtual machine and today we
391:24 - will work on that particular thing so
391:27 - basically in this video we will create
391:28 - one virtual machine and we will uh share
391:31 - the file or move file from this machine
391:34 - from this ubu machine to that particular
391:36 - remote machine okay so we will do this
391:39 - with the SCP command so let's start the
391:42 - video all first of all we will need to
391:43 - create a virtual
391:45 - machine so on this particular URL you
391:48 - can go like learn microsoft.com and uh
391:51 - intro to Azure virtual machine then you
391:53 - here you will get the sandbox and you
391:55 - will get the access of 1 hour of azure
391:58 - portal so you don't need to pay any
392:00 - amount of money for creating v machine
392:03 - or anything okay so we'll wait for some
392:06 - time uh it will just take hardly 10
392:09 - second
392:12 - now okay let's
392:17 - wait 9 2 93
392:21 - 4 okay 100 okay so here you can see 59
392:24 - minutes so it's basically we get access
392:26 - for 1 hour so now come down and just
392:29 - click on this as your
392:33 - portal now here you will get the
392:35 - interface and uh maybe uh you will need
392:38 - to sign in with your Microsoft account
392:40 - then and only then you will get the
392:44 - access okay it's taking some time let's
392:47 - wait okay here we go now here you will
392:49 - see the virtual machine you have to just
392:51 - click on it virtual machine
392:55 - and uh you will need to just go on
392:57 - Create and click on this as your virtual
393:04 - machine sometime
393:06 - yeah here you have to just select your
393:09 - resource
393:11 - Group and virtual machine name I will
393:14 - just uh use this name Linux VM and the
393:18 - usern name and password so I will write
393:21 - the username as iush and the password I
393:23 - will write
393:35 - sorry okay again enter the
393:41 - password okay password match so here SSS
393:44 - 2022 Port is allowed so basically SCP
393:47 - command runs on this particular Port by
393:50 - default okay so uh next you will do but
393:54 - here you don't have to change any kind
393:56 - of settings and all it will be def by
394:00 - default it will be same okay we don't
394:02 - need to change
394:04 - anything okay here we go now what do you
394:07 - have to do you have to just click on
394:08 - review plus create it will take uh
394:10 - approx 1 minute of
394:15 - time uh okay till now I pause the
394:22 - video okay guys so here you can see the
394:25 - validation is passed or now we have to
394:28 - just click on this create
394:30 - button so it will just create a virtual
394:32 - machine and we will get the public IP
394:35 - address of that particular machine and
394:37 - we will use that particular IP address
394:39 - to connect with this machine and uh
394:42 - whatever the username and password we
394:43 - have provided while creating this
394:45 - virtual machine we will uh use that one
394:48 - to connect to this particular remote
394:51 - host so let's wait for some time it will
394:53 - just hardly take a two to 3 minutes of
394:56 - time okay so deployment is in progress
394:59 - let's
395:03 - wait okay so till now uh till then I
395:06 - just uh give you the overview of what is
395:08 - the SCP command so already I have told
395:11 - you like this command is used to like
395:14 - U copy the file from one host to remote
395:18 - host so here basically this machine is
395:21 - my uh physical host physical machine
395:24 - machine you can say and the Machine to
395:26 - which I will connect like this virtual
395:28 - machine that will be the my remote host
395:31 - so I will use this command to share file
395:34 - from this machine to another machine so
395:37 - there are also some many of options we
395:40 - use for fast transfer for getting
395:42 - information while transferring we will
395:45 - use all those particular functions so
395:48 - here you can see the deployment is
395:50 - complete now we have to just click on go
395:52 - to Resource and we will get the
395:54 - particular public IP
395:56 - address and uh here it will show yeah
396:00 - here here is the public IP address first
396:02 - of all what I will do I will just uh uh
396:04 - try to connect to that particular
396:06 - machine using the credential which we
396:08 - had provided in while
396:10 - creation I hope the terminal visible to
396:13 - you just uh SSH and whatever the
396:15 - username I and the IP
396:19 - address okay so you have just write yes
396:22 - it will uh
396:26 - uh permission denied public okay I don't
396:29 - let me just close the terminal and again
396:30 - I will open
396:34 - up SSH
396:38 - iush at theate IP
396:42 - address okay password it's asking me for
396:49 - password hit enter okay now I hope I
396:52 - have entered correct address uh password
396:55 - okay okay so now here you can see the uh
396:58 - whatever the host name we had added like
396:59 - Linux VM and the I the username okay so
397:02 - if I will do uh clear the screen and I
397:04 - will write who am I so here you can see
397:08 - the uh username is aush and uh also you
397:12 - can see this host name has been changed
397:14 - from Linux VM uh from I to Linux VM I
397:17 - think let me again open up one terminal
397:19 - and here you can see aush virtual box is
397:21 - there okay so this one is my remote
397:27 - machine I just add one comment
397:30 - here
397:32 - remote machine and I will just provide
397:35 - the IP address okay so this is
397:39 - the like comment we use hash for writing
397:41 - the comment in this Linux terminal now
397:43 - moving forward another the use of the
397:45 - SCP command comes here if we we have a
397:48 - file suppose I have to just create one
397:50 - file let me create one file with the
397:51 - name of CAD test.txt
397:55 - and I will just uh not test I will write
397:58 - some another cat remote file. dxt and I
398:03 - will write something like this
398:06 - file is being sent
398:10 - from iuse
398:12 - [Music]
398:13 - physical
398:15 - machine contr D to save now we have to
398:19 - use the SCP command so basically SCP
398:22 - what it stands for it basically stands
398:24 - for secure copy so you will send the
398:26 - file using uh Port like 2022 it
398:30 - basically by default it uses Port 2022
398:33 - and also our this machine accepts only
398:35 - port number 22 no other port number it
398:37 - accepts the if request is coming from
398:40 - coming for the some other port number uh
398:42 - other than 2022 then in that case it
398:44 - will not reply back to that
398:48 - particular host okay so now what we have
398:52 - to do uh I will just uh let me do
398:55 - LS so here you can see the remote file.
398:58 - text is there and let me just clear this
399:01 - screen and SCP I will use and I will use
399:05 - hyphone capital c for the faster
399:08 - transfer and the file name that is a
399:10 - remote file.txt and the username I will
399:13 - also need to provide here iush
399:17 - add I at the rate and the control shift
399:20 - V and I will need to provide the
399:22 - location where we want to just uh what
399:26 - we say store that file so I will store
399:30 - this file at this particular location
399:31 - home
399:33 - iush and 251 and I will just need to use
399:37 - this
399:38 - colon and
399:41 - uh
399:44 - sorry okay sorry sorry I just
399:49 - uh I will need to again write the
399:52 - command so so here I have to just
399:56 - uh use slom I okay so here what will
400:00 - happen basically uh this remote file.txt
400:02 - will get transferred from this machine
400:04 - to this machine like copy will be
400:06 - transferred so let me just hit enter and
400:09 - it will ask me to enter the password and
400:12 - I will just enter the
400:15 - password okay
400:18 - done so here you can see 100% so 0.2 kb
400:22 - per second was the speed and uh let me
400:24 - clear the screen and I will do LS so
400:26 - here you can see the remote file.txt has
400:28 - been uh like copied into this particular
400:31 - remote host okay uh like uh let me uh
400:36 - just send another file also let me
400:39 - create a.txt
400:44 - this is
400:47 - aush okay control D to save again I will
400:51 - use the same command just change the
400:52 - file name
400:56 - file name to aush now hit enter again
400:59 - maybe hope it
401:00 - will ask me to enter the password but
401:03 - let's see yeah I will need to enter the
401:06 - password that is Kumar atate 098
401:10 - HH hit enter and uh the file will get
401:14 - copied into that particular
401:17 - location okay it's taking time I don't
401:19 - know
401:22 - why okay yeah done so I will do again LS
401:27 - here so here you can see i. txt has been
401:30 - copied now I will just try to read the
401:33 - content of this particular
401:35 - file okay
401:41 - so I think the connection is slow that's
401:44 - why it's
401:46 - lagging okay sorry Ive used wrong I have
401:50 - to read this okay okay
401:57 - let me just remove
402:04 - this okay
402:06 - yeah now just hit
402:10 - enter so basically it has overwritten
402:14 - with the like nothing we had written so
402:17 - by this command basically the text was
402:18 - over written no problem let me just read
402:21 - the another file we have also
402:22 - transferred another file that is the
402:24 - remote file.txt we can read this okay so
402:28 - here you can see this file is being sent
402:29 - from I physical machine the same text
402:32 - which we had written in this particular
402:34 - physical machine okay so in this way we
402:37 - can transfer the files from one machine
402:39 - to another machine and also by default
402:41 - the CP uses AES 128 uh encryption method
402:46 - to encrypt files while uh while
402:48 - translate you can say but if you have to
402:51 - use some another method then you can use
402:54 - the hyph C Small option also if you if
402:57 - you want to use some some different port
403:00 - number uh like if you will need to use
403:02 - then hyph capital P option okay but by
403:05 - default this machine is accepting only
403:07 - the port number
403:08 - 2022 so if I will use some another port
403:11 - number then in that case it will not uh
403:14 - what we
403:15 - say it will not accept the request so if
403:18 - I will do hyphone Port 234 and I will
403:21 - just try to uh I will remove remove the
403:24 - files from this
403:26 - machine okay it's uh like running slow I
403:29 - don't know maybe it's reason behind is
403:33 - slow connection it may be so I will just
403:35 - remove the i. txt file here okay sorry I
403:41 - you should there
403:42 - yeah so now file has been removed and
403:45 - now I have used the hyphen
403:47 - p234 and I will use hyphen Capital C
403:50 - option and just hit enter so in this in
403:53 - this case you will get like uh it will
403:56 - not accept the request
403:58 - like uh it will not display anything
404:01 - nothing will
404:03 - happen Okay to solve this issue we will
404:06 - need to use just hyph V option also hyph
404:09 - is small V that is just used for getting
404:13 - the default
404:16 - information
404:18 - okay hopefully we will
404:22 - get get not connecting to this port
404:26 - number yeah because port number is not
404:28 - open that port number is not open in
404:29 - this machine that's why so if I will use
404:32 - uh just port number
404:37 - 2022 and we have used the wrong command
404:41 - also hyphen P 2022 hyphen C Small hyphen
404:47 - V and now hit enter and here you got the
404:50 - all the
404:51 - information so now you have have to just
404:53 - enter the password but ever again you
404:56 - will see the information like connecting
404:59 - to this particular IP address on Port
405:01 - 20202 enter the
405:05 - password so done next okay sending
405:10 - command sending file modes i t 300% 15
405:14 - compress outgoing raw data this compress
405:16 - to this so while trans Transit what
405:19 - happens whatever the amount of whatever
405:21 - the size of your file will get
405:22 - compressed and then again it will
405:24 - whenever we it will reach to the remote
405:26 - machine it will uh like um stored in the
405:30 - original form so again if I do LS
405:34 - here so you will get the i. txt file
405:37 - okay so uh now let's do with uh
405:41 - different port number let's see what
405:43 - happens to actually total port number in
405:47 - network we use are approx
405:50 - 65,535 are the total port
405:52 - numbers I've just tell it told about
405:55 - this for your information
405:57 - only so here you will see connecting to
406:00 - this uh particular IP and the port then
406:03 - you can see the port and after this
406:04 - nothing will happen because uh this
406:07 - machine is not uh accepting any port
406:11 - number other than Port
406:14 - 2022 so it will not happen anything it
406:16 - will go in the infinite Loop you can say
406:18 - and but like we just need to hit contrl
406:22 - C
406:24 - so basically in this way you can use the
406:26 - SCP command to share files from one
406:28 - machine to another machine remotely or
406:31 - or also you can say like the two remote
406:33 - machines are there then then only then
406:35 - you can use this particular command so
406:37 - that's all for the today's video and I
406:39 - hope you liked it if you have any
406:40 - queries then you can ask us in the
406:42 - comment section so thank you thank you
406:43 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
406:45 - one thank
406:47 - you hello guys now in this particular
406:49 - video we are going to cover about the
406:51 - most important command that is the
406:52 - uptime command okay so uh this is a very
406:55 - simple command and it will not take much
406:57 - time so let me introduce you first with
407:01 - what is this and so basically uptime is
407:03 - a command which is basically we use to
407:05 - find the how long the server is running
407:08 - okay so let's start with the
407:10 - implementation part so I will just hit
407:13 - up time oh
407:15 - sorry it's up time and here you can see
407:20 - it's 1851 51 that is 6 51 and up since
407:26 - uh 34 Minute like from right now it's
407:30 - 651 as you can see it's 652 right
407:33 - now and now it's running till uh 34
407:37 - Minute and number of user who are logged
407:39 - in that is only one user is logged in
407:41 - and this is the average load you can see
407:44 - okay so to get output uh in a very uh
407:48 - easy way to in understandable way as
407:50 - this is there are multiple things here
407:53 - like Uh current time up time okay users
407:57 - okay so but before that let me increase
408:00 - the font size I forgot to
408:02 - increase okay so I can use different
408:05 - options uh you can use hph to see what
408:08 - are the options available so here you
408:11 - can see hyphen P it will show up time in
408:13 - pretty format so let's use this and
408:17 - let's check whether output comes in
408:19 - pretty format or not so up time hyph P
408:22 - we are done okay so the server is
408:24 - running
408:25 - from uh it's running since 35 minutes
408:29 - okay uh let's use another option we will
408:32 - use hyph
408:34 - S so it's uh the time at that time was
408:39 - 617 okay now it's
408:41 - 653 okay so and you can check the
408:44 - version of this uptime command using
408:46 - hyphen
408:49 - V okay this is something uh 3. do 17
408:54 - okay so I hope you liked it guys this
408:57 - video so as this command is basically
408:59 - useful when you go in a corporate and
409:02 - you need to fetch some server up time
409:04 - whether the servers is running or not
409:06 - okay so in that case you can use this
409:09 - basically command Okay so that's just
409:10 - for today's video and I will meet you in
409:13 - the next one thank you thank you for
409:16 - watching now in this video we are going
409:18 - to learn about the most interesting
409:19 - command that is a uname command okay so
409:21 - basically this command you use to get
409:22 - the information about your machine okay
409:25 - so basically we will use this command to
409:27 - get the information about this Ubuntu
409:29 - machine so we will basically start with
409:31 - this and we will use some of the flags
409:33 - or you can say options with this uh uh
409:36 - un command to get the host name to get
409:38 - the kernel whatever the kernel is being
409:40 - used in this particular machine what is
409:42 - the name of the kernel and also you will
409:44 - get multiple information like operating
409:46 - system Hardware platform information
409:49 - machine information everything you will
409:50 - get to know in this particular video so
409:52 - uh let's start with the implementation
409:55 - part so here un name if you provide
409:58 - without any option if you will execute
410:00 - this command you will just get the uh
410:02 - like name of the kernel name you will
410:05 - get okay so here you can see uh as we
410:08 - already know like in the installation
410:09 - video we have saw like the ubu is based
410:12 - on the Linux kernel so that's why it is
410:15 - showing the Linux so but before starting
410:18 - uh uh the like going deep into the video
410:20 - I want to just uh give you the overview
410:22 - of what is the Linux kernel okay so a
410:24 - lenux kernel basically you can say as
410:26 - the core of the operating system okay if
410:28 - there is an operating system the kernel
410:29 - will be the core of that operating
410:31 - system B why because it creates an
410:33 - interface you can say or creates a
410:35 - connection between your
410:40 - Hardware hardware and your software okay
410:45 - so basically uh kernel has all the
410:48 - control of your operating system if
410:50 - kernel fails then whole operating system
410:52 - will get failed
410:53 - you can say like that also so I hope
410:56 - that is basic information is clear to
410:58 - you and we will see about ker release
411:01 - what is Kernel release so uh let me tell
411:03 - you about the kernel release so kernel
411:04 - release is nothing but whenever a new
411:06 - version is released of a kernel like if
411:09 - there is suppose version is suppose
411:11 - 5.0.1 you can say like that then uh
411:15 - again new version is create uh released
411:16 - that is 5.0.2 so why this new version
411:20 - and why this new kernel release has been
411:22 - done because if there is some
411:24 - vulnerability or any bugs in the first
411:26 - colel then that bug will get patched and
411:28 - then again new release will be done okay
411:32 - new current release will be done okay so
411:35 - that is the concept basically current
411:37 - release so now we will see the uh CER
411:40 - release so for this we basically use the
411:43 - hyph r option so here you can see the
411:46 - now currently version current release
411:48 - version of this machine is this
411:51 - 5.15 40 one generic okay so in this way
411:55 - you can get the CER release information
411:57 - now moving forward uh let me just show
412:00 - you this uh Linux like kernel name you
412:04 - can use hyph S option also to get
412:07 - the uh kernel name okay so uh like both
412:12 - will give you the same result like un
412:14 - name and unim high furnace uh okay and
412:17 - uh now next moving forward uh if you
412:20 - want to get the uh host name of your
412:22 - computer like host name is like that
412:24 - name which is used over the network you
412:27 - can say like that so if you you will do
412:29 - un name hyphen and then obviously you
412:31 - will get the host name as in my case
412:33 - this is aush virtual box is the host
412:35 - name and again uh next if you want to
412:38 - get information about your machine about
412:40 - your processor then you can use hyphen M
412:42 - for your machine you name hyphen M for
412:46 - your machine so like it is 64bit you can
412:49 - say you can see here it is and uh next
412:52 - if you want to get information about
412:54 - your processor then it's also easily you
412:56 - can get using iPhone P
412:58 - option so
413:00 - same information is being displayed here
413:03 - like it is the basically the
413:05 - architecture okay so now next moving
413:08 - forward uh if you want to get the
413:10 - hardware platform all those thing you
413:12 - will get the same I think yeah Hardware
413:14 - platform is the same 64bit and to get
413:17 - the name of the operating system so
413:19 - obviously it is
413:21 - uh J Linux so Linux operating system it
413:24 - is open to so now again uh like uh there
413:29 - is also one uh super command you can say
413:31 - like super option that is hyph a option
413:34 - which basically gives you all the result
413:36 - of these like you you don't need to
413:38 - write this all to get if release you you
413:42 - you don't need to uh write hyph r hyph s
413:46 - hyph and anything you can use a simple
413:48 - command that is a un
413:50 - name hyph a hit enter and here you will
413:54 - get the all the information like Linux
413:56 - is the Kel name this is the host name
413:58 - this is the version and this is the uh
414:03 - what you can say I think this is uh your
414:06 - uh version name it maybe yeah it should
414:09 - be version name like
414:13 - #p yeah it's a colel version name it is
414:16 - and next is the date of creation or
414:19 - installation and next is your all the
414:22 - architect
414:23 - processor architecture everything you
414:25 - can see and the and at the last you can
414:27 - see the name of the operating system so
414:31 - I hope you liked it guys that was a very
414:33 - uh basic tutorial so that's all for
414:36 - today's video and if you have any
414:37 - queries then you can ask in the comment
414:39 - section so thank you for watching and
414:41 - we'll meet in the next video thank you
414:43 - thank you so
414:44 - much now in this video we are going to
414:46 - learn about the another command uh that
414:48 - is the host name command okay so
414:51 - basically host name command is be used
414:53 - to get the information about your what
414:55 - is the host name like this name and uh
414:58 - how you can change the name also with
415:00 - the help of host command you will get
415:03 - the uh IP address okay so we will start
415:07 - with the implementation
415:09 - part so let me increase the first uh
415:11 - font size so hope it is visible to you
415:15 - so now what we have to do we have to
415:16 - just write the host name so it will
415:18 - basically give you the whatever the host
415:19 - name of your computer that is this one I
415:21 - virtual box okay so also you can uh like
415:25 - uh what we say change the host name and
415:29 - also you can get the IP address using
415:32 - different options if I will use hyphen I
415:34 - then it will give me this Local Host IP
415:36 - address and but if you will use the
415:39 - capital I then in that case you will get
415:42 - the actual IP address and whatever the
415:44 - IP address will be present in your
415:46 - system so in this case we have only one
415:49 - IP address and now moving forward uh the
415:53 - interesting part of this particular
415:54 - video is that uh you can change the uh
415:57 - host name also so how you can do it it
415:59 - totally uh there are basically two
416:01 - methods and you should be like uh run
416:06 - this command as a root okay like in my
416:09 - case this iush user is like in the sudos
416:12 - file and we can easily change using this
416:14 - particular command so how you can do it
416:17 - uh you have to just uh use this
416:19 - particular Pudo host name and uh host
416:24 - name and then what we have to do you
416:26 - have to just give the uh
416:28 - different name okay I will give this
416:32 - one actually this is my Instagram page
416:34 - username uh you can follow if you want
416:40 - so I think I enter wrong password let me
416:44 - erase now
416:46 - iush okay so a specified host name is
416:49 - invalid because we have used underscore
416:51 - so underscores are not allow I will just
416:53 - remove it
416:55 - underscores and hit enter and now I will
416:58 - again open up the one terminal new
417:00 - terminal and here you can see
417:02 - the host name has been changed from aush
417:06 - virtual box to this one xaby okay so but
417:10 - now what I want I want to uh like keep
417:13 - my host name as it is so I will just
417:15 - copy this
417:17 - one and what I will do I will just again
417:21 - uh
417:22 - run this command I use this and now in
417:25 - this case you will get that is same at
417:27 - same as pre previous one okay so moving
417:30 - forward uh if you want to uh change this
417:33 - host name in some kind of different
417:35 - method so how you can do it it's uh it
417:37 - is very uh unique thing you can say like
417:40 - you will you will use the one file I
417:43 - will create one file that is uh let's
417:45 - create with the host name.
417:47 - txt and I will write the host name as
417:51 - let me write
417:52 - uh uh let's write same thing exite and
417:56 - contr D to save and now what we have to
417:58 - do uh you have to just use this command
418:01 - that is the sud
418:05 - sudo host name and capital F and the
418:09 - file name which we have created that is
418:10 - host name. txt and uh now again I will
418:13 - open up the new terminal and here you
418:15 - can see the host name has been changed
418:19 - from Ice virtual box to exite again so
418:22 - in this way you can change the host name
418:24 - also very easily now moving forward uh
418:27 - if you talk about the like fq that is a
418:31 - fully qualified domain name that is
418:33 - basically domain name for a specific
418:34 - computer or a host on the internet you
418:36 - can see like that so how you find it
418:38 - using this only one option that is
418:40 - hyphen f
418:42 - so this is the now my
418:46 - actual host name so in this case you can
418:49 - get the fqdn also if you want to learn
418:51 - more about it you can just Google it
418:53 - what is what are
418:54 - fqdn so uh first now let me again change
418:58 - my host name to the previous one this
419:00 - one yeah now it
419:03 - changed so yeah
419:05 - done so uh I hope you like this
419:08 - particular video and if you have any
419:09 - queries if you have any doubt then
419:11 - please ask us in the comment section so
419:13 - that's all for today's video we will
419:14 - stop here and I will meet you in the
419:16 - next video so thank you thank you for
419:17 - watching and we'll meet you next one
419:19 - thank you guys
419:20 - bye-bye now in this video we are going
419:22 - to to learn about the password command
419:24 - okay so basically uh this command is
419:26 - basically we used to change the password
419:28 - of any user or if you want to add uh
419:31 - like password expiration days or
419:33 - anything you want to perform with the
419:35 - password any kind of operation like uh
419:38 - if you want to delete the password you
419:39 - want to make account password L then
419:42 - this command is used okay so we will
419:44 - basically start with the user creation
419:46 - like we will first of all add a
419:48 - user and then we will perform that
419:51 - operation on that particular user so I'm
419:54 - adding one user
419:56 - here only one or two names allowed okay
420:02 - I'm just giving the name as
420:05 - uh password
420:08 - user here new password it asking me for
420:12 - I will give the new
420:14 - password okay no required these
420:17 - information yes okay clear now first of
420:21 - all what I will do I first
420:25 - uh log into that
420:28 - user password user and I will just enter
420:32 - the password and yeah here you can see
420:33 - I'm logged in into that particular user
420:37 - and now I will just exit because I want
420:39 - to use my account okay so let's start
420:42 - with the
420:46 - uh
420:47 - password command okay so now what we
420:51 - have to do you the command is basically
420:53 - used with the Pudo why because only the
420:57 - root user or whatever the user who is
421:00 - present in the sud file that that can
421:03 - only change the password or the current
421:05 - user if you uh do like this sudo and
421:09 - only password it will what it will do it
421:11 - will change the password of your current
421:14 - account that is my account that is a and
421:17 - it will ask me for the new password okay
421:19 - but I don't want to uh change my
421:21 - password okay so uh for a minute let's
421:25 - change okay so here you can see password
421:28 - updated successfully but again I want to
421:31 - keep my old
421:34 - password so I will write that
421:45 - password okay password did successfully
421:47 - okay so now moving forward what you can
421:49 - do if you want to change the password of
421:51 - any other account that is a root account
421:53 - then also you can change that how you
421:55 - can do it that is sud sudo
421:58 - password that is pass WD not a full
422:01 - password it's a pass WD and then the
422:03 - user account name that is root so here
422:06 - you can
422:08 - change the password password updated
422:10 - successfully now what you can do you can
422:12 - just log in with that credential using
422:14 - Su that is switch user
422:16 - command and here you will need to just
422:20 - uh
422:26 - okay so now here you can just enter the
422:27 - password of the root user and you will
422:29 - get the access of the root account okay
422:32 - so with this you can change the password
422:34 - of any other user and also you can do
422:36 - many operations okay so now what we will
422:38 - do we will just uh uh change the
422:41 - password of the the user which we had
422:43 - created now so let me just close this
422:46 - terminal and uh I will just copy this
422:49 - username because it's so long username I
422:51 - had Tak no problem just sud sudo
422:56 - password and the name of the user that
422:58 - is a password user and enter and the new
423:01 - password I will provide him just uh okay
423:05 - password updated successfully so now
423:07 - what I will do I will just open up the
423:08 - new terminal and I will log in with that
423:10 - new password I know the password is not
423:12 - visible
423:13 - because the this is the feature of the
423:16 - Linux like you cannot see the password
423:18 - like it's a great
423:20 - thing okay password user user user okay
423:25 - it's not coming okay now door okay yeah
423:29 - so here you can see you have we have
423:30 - logged in with this particular account
423:33 - so now let's uh do some certain
423:35 - operations like now what I will do I
423:36 - will just close up this terminal and uh
423:38 - I
423:40 - will just use some uh some options like
423:44 - high friendly option now we will use so
423:47 - basically what happen this option
423:48 - deletes the password and make the
423:51 - account password
423:52 - list okay so if we do like
423:57 - this password hyph D and the username
424:01 - that is a password
424:05 - user and here I have to use sud
424:09 - sudo so password expiry information
424:12 - changed okay now what I will do I will
424:14 - just again open up the new terminal and
424:16 - I will try to log in and I will check
424:18 - whether it asks me for entering the
424:20 - password or not so here you can see it
424:22 - is not asking me to enter any password
424:24 - as you can see the password user uh like
424:27 - is logged in now if I will do here who
424:29 - am I here it will show me the password
424:31 - user so using hyund the option you can
424:34 - just make any account
424:36 - passwordless so suppose uh if you want
424:38 - to create a guest account for the like
424:41 - any user who want to use the system and
424:44 - you will just give him them give him
424:46 - that certain uh permissions like not you
424:48 - will not provide him the root permission
424:50 - and you can create a account
424:52 - passwordless the guest account can could
424:53 - be passwordless uh let it be okay it
424:56 - will not affect your system or the
425:01 - administrator so in this way you can
425:03 - just create a passwordless account now
425:06 - moving forward uh let me try to just add
425:09 - the password let me check what
425:12 - happens if I do PSE
425:15 - sudo password password
425:19 - user and H ask asking me to enter the
425:22 - new password I am again entering and now
425:25 - I will just exit here and again I will
425:27 - try to just switch into that account and
425:31 - now it should ask me to enter the
425:33 - password and here you can see it's
425:34 - asking me to enter the password and now
425:36 - here you can see I have logged in as the
425:38 - password
425:39 - user okay so in this way you can add the
425:43 - password remove the password or you can
425:45 - log into that account using terminal
425:48 - using switch user command so many
425:51 - information you got till now okay now
425:53 - moving forward uh suppose if you want to
425:57 - like immediately change the password if
426:00 - you suppose if you will use hyphen e
426:02 - option let me clear the screen
426:05 - first I will use Soo password hyphen e
426:08 - option if you you will use hyph e option
426:10 - so what it option does it basically uh
426:12 - like prompt the user to change your
426:15 - password after login okay so let me show
426:19 - you just uh the implementation part I
426:22 - will just use that username password
426:24 - user password expiry changed and again I
426:26 - will exit and again I will try to just
426:29 - log in with this user sorry password
426:31 - user and I will just enter the password
426:34 - and it will ask me to you are required
426:36 - to change your password immediately
426:37 - administrator enforce like as I admin I
426:40 - just enforce that particular user to
426:42 - change your password
426:44 - immediately okay you got it like Suppose
426:46 - there is a uh like organization in which
426:49 - the admin want to change the like like
426:52 - admin wants like uh their user should
426:55 - change their password immediately okay
426:57 - so he can just uh add multiple users and
427:00 - then it will enforce them to change
427:03 - their password immediately okay so it
427:05 - ask me to enter the current password and
427:06 - the new password I will
427:11 - write the password is sorter than eight
427:13 - correctors so I have to enter the
427:15 - password which is longer than eight
427:20 - correctors
427:22 - okay the password fa the dictionary
427:23 - check it doesn't contain enough
427:25 - character okay no problem so but uh you
427:28 - got the point I just didn't use the
427:30 - strong password that's why it's showing
427:31 - like this but in case of you if you will
427:34 - enter the combination of the zero and
427:36 - one and makeig capital letter small
427:38 - letters characters then that will make
427:40 - the basically a strong password okay so
427:43 - now moving forward I hope you got this
427:45 - point okay but still let it be I will
427:47 - just let me show you the implementation
427:49 - otherwise you will think like uh I
427:51 - didn't uh showed you the implementation
427:53 - but again let me just do the same
427:56 - thing and I will just log in that user I
428:00 - will enter the password and current
428:01 - password it is asking me current
428:03 - password I will just enter the
428:06 - password some long password I will enter
428:09 - okay so it's not showing any kind of air
428:12 - right now so sorry again I will need to
428:16 - do the same
428:20 - thing again there is some type
428:24 - mistake it should not done yeah okay
428:27 - finally we change the password okay now
428:29 - I you do who am I and you can see like
428:31 - I'm logged in as the password
428:33 - user okay so using hyph option you can
428:36 - just force the particular user to change
428:39 - their password immediately after
428:41 - login okay so now U moving forward uh if
428:45 - you want to add the like some number of
428:47 - days like uh minimum number of days
428:49 - required to change the password suppose
428:51 - you create a user and um like uh Suppose
428:56 - there a there is a organization and
428:59 - there is a
429:00 - intern okay intern comes in
429:06 - organization comes in organization to do
429:10 - internship so obviously you will provide
429:13 - him he will work for some kind of 90
429:16 - days or 120 days or any number of days
429:19 - he will work so obviously you will
429:20 - create their account and you want to
429:23 - automatically expire their account after
429:25 - certain period of time or or you want to
429:27 - change his password after certain period
429:29 - of time okay there are many number of
429:31 - requirements you can do so to do these
429:34 - kind of things we use the minimum days
429:36 - okay mean days option so it means we
429:39 - cannot just change the password before
429:41 - 100 days if you provide 100 in
429:44 - uh in a option okay suppose the intern
429:47 - you don't want to change the password of
429:50 - intern uh till his journey suppose he
429:53 - starting from 0o to uh 50 days if there
429:56 - is intention of 50 days and you don't
429:58 - want to change the and you don't want to
430:00 - like in turn to change his password in
430:03 - this case you can use easily uh hyphen M
430:07 - as option so let me use this option like
430:09 - it's a great thing uh I will use this
430:12 - password and hyph M days I will use M
430:16 - days and the number of days
430:18 - I just I'm assuming the 50 and
430:22 - uh
430:24 - username password user I think it was
430:26 - the username
430:28 - yeah okay so there is a invited option
430:32 - it is showing me uh okay is there
430:37 - any okay there is no any option with
430:40 - hyphen M okay let me just try with hyph
430:43 - iph mindus maybe it should work let's
430:47 - see okay it's showing me permission deny
430:49 - and why it's so just clear the screen I
430:51 - have not used sudo here that's why it's
430:53 - showing me permission Den so sudo and
430:55 - password expired information change and
430:57 - now what I will do I will just not exit
431:00 - I will just clear the screen and now I'm
431:03 - logged in as a password user and I will
431:05 - try to change my password so whether I'm
431:09 - able to change or not let's see because
431:11 - I have changed the permission of like I
431:13 - cannot change my
431:15 - password like uh till 50
431:19 - days okay changing password for password
431:22 - user okay but now let me just close this
431:25 - session because this is a like uh you
431:26 - can say old session I will create a new
431:29 - session and then I will try to change
431:32 - the
431:32 - password sudo sorry Su password
431:38 - user and the password what it was
431:42 - yeah I forgot yeah let me just increase
431:47 - the font size I will just enter this
431:49 - password and I will write Uh current
431:53 - password okay so here you can see you
431:56 - must wait longer to change your password
431:58 - okay so this is a uh like great feature
432:01 - like you cannot change your
432:03 - password before 50 days okay similarly
432:08 - you can use the max days option it will
432:10 - just uh like uh suppose if you provide
432:13 - 100 days then after that what will
432:15 - happen your password will expire and U
432:18 - you will need to obviously change that
432:20 - password and okay so what we will do we
432:23 - will just contrl C okay it's not working
432:25 - control C I don't know why let me just
432:28 - type like this
432:30 - okay password unchanged now what I will
432:33 - do I will just uh use Max St option so
432:36 - what it will do it will just uh like
432:39 - your password will get expired after
432:41 - this number of days so I will just leave
432:43 - it
432:44 - uh
432:46 - as
432:48 - 100 pass expiry chain and uh you your
432:52 - password will expire after 100 days okay
432:55 - and also you can use another option that
432:57 - is one day option password hyph iPhone
433:01 - one
433:02 - days so it will warn you to change your
433:04 - password before
433:06 - expiry
433:08 - okay so permission denied you know the
433:11 - reason because we have not used sudo
433:14 - here expiry changed okay so this is the
433:18 - way to manipulate with the
433:21 - uh password command okay and also one
433:23 - more thing is there like inactive is
433:25 - also one option which we can use to
433:27 - deactivate account suppose after 10 days
433:30 - of expiration uh your password expires
433:33 - and and still you don't change the
433:35 - password and in that case your account
433:36 - will get
433:37 - deactivated okay and also one more
433:39 - option is there that is password hyph
433:41 - capital S and sud
433:44 - sudo and I will just provide a username
433:47 - hope it will work yeah so here it will
433:50 - show the some of the information like uh
433:52 - you can see the date the today's date is
433:54 - 39 IP just shows
433:57 - the uh like uh account is locked or
434:04 - unlocked and here the date shows the uh
434:08 - creation of the password and the 50 is
434:09 - the minimum days and 100 is the maximum
434:11 - days as we got to know and 10 is the
434:13 - warning days you can see here okay so
434:16 - that's all for today's video guys and I
434:17 - hope you liked it and if you have any
434:19 - queries then you can ask in the comment
434:20 - section and and please just give me the
434:23 - feedback in the comment section like how
434:25 - is the videos going on and are you
434:27 - getting or not and also you can uh ask
434:30 - me if you have any doubt on Instagram
434:31 - you can just uh you can just uh follow
434:35 - this page that is xaby I know the name
434:39 - is little bit difficult uh tricky you
434:41 - can just search asore 3xa yt3
434:45 - uncore okay you can ask me doubt here
434:48 - also so that's all for today guys and
434:50 - we'll meet you in the next one so thank
434:52 - you and we will meet in next one
434:55 - bye-bye now in this video we are going
434:57 - to learn about the CH as command okay so
434:59 - basically this is similar command uh
435:01 - just we learned about in previous that
435:03 - is password command but in this we
435:05 - cannot change the password okay so we
435:08 - will start with the basic options and
435:11 - basic implementation of this command so
435:13 - that is CHS and using hunel you can get
435:16 - the information of a password of any
435:18 - account but before moving forward for we
435:21 - will need to create a password uh sorry
435:23 - not
435:24 - password a user sud sudo not user I will
435:29 - use add
435:31 - user and I will name that user as a
435:41 - xaby
435:42 - okay so I will just use like this
435:48 - xab BYT XA okay
435:54 - password nothing nothing nothing nothing
435:57 - why okay clear the screen now just ch
436:02 - age and provide hyphen L as option and
436:06 - the user name that is a
436:09 - xaby okay permission denied okay no
436:12 - problem we will just use the Pudo and we
436:14 - will get the permission is that easy yes
436:19 - okay so here you can see the the last
436:21 - password change is that 7 uh like 30
436:23 - September it means today's date and
436:25 - password expires never never nothing is
436:27 - added account expires nothing is added
436:30 - minimum number of days between password
436:32 - change is zero uh by default and by
436:34 - default maximum is 999 it's uh like it
436:37 - takes the date from 1970 I think that's
436:40 - why it's showing that number of days and
436:42 - warning warning is this like if your
436:46 - password get like
436:49 - uh uh n9th after before 7 days of this
436:54 - completion you will get a warning okay
436:57 - so now uh let's move and I will use this
436:59 - uh we will use the maximum number of
437:01 - days like we will use hyphen M option to
437:04 - change
437:05 - the maximum number of days like this
437:09 - one so how we can do it CH is hyphen
437:12 - capital M I will just use 100 and the
437:14 - username that is
437:15 - uh this one and permission denied again
437:19 - because we have not used sudo let me use
437:21 - too and done and we will just clear the
437:24 - screen and just call that function and
437:26 - here on that command and here you can
437:28 - see the maximum number of days between
437:30 - password change is 100 now similarly you
437:32 - can just uh add the minimum number of
437:34 - days also what it will do like it will
437:36 - just uh you cannot change your password
437:39 - uh before that particular days whatever
437:41 - you specify in minimum days so you can
437:44 - do it it's simple just instead of
437:47 - capital M you will need to use hyph M
437:49 - and you can use here the number of day
437:51 - that is 50 like till 50 days you cannot
437:53 - change your
437:54 - password again let me show the
437:57 - information and here you can see the 50
437:59 - days like minimum number of days between
438:02 - password change is
438:03 - 50 moving forward if you will provide a
438:06 - minus one option then what will happen
438:09 - let's see with maximum number of days it
438:12 - will remove that uh it will not check
438:14 - for that
438:16 - validation hyphen M and if I will
438:19 - provide minus one and and I will again
438:21 - check and here you can see minus one it
438:22 - will like it will not check for the
438:24 - maximum number of days if you will use
438:26 - minus one but I don't want to use minus
438:28 - one I will simply use the
438:30 - 100 to keep
438:33 - things simple okay moving forward if you
438:38 - will use uh zero in a small M like in
438:41 - minimum number of days it means the user
438:44 - can change the password
438:47 - anytime but if you but if you use some
438:51 - kind of number here then user can can
438:53 - change that password after that number
438:55 - of days if I use zero then user can
438:58 - change the password anytime if he wants
439:01 - okay that is the main use of
439:03 - zero and but I will use 50 here
439:08 - okay now moving forward uh if you want
439:11 - to add the expiry date in your password
439:14 - like your password should expired after
439:16 - that certain number of days okay so how
439:18 - you can do it if I will use like this
439:24 - Pudo let me just yeah sud sudo hyph
439:27 - capital E and I will use the format as
439:31 - year
439:33 - 2022 uh 10 and 01 and the
439:42 - username okay and tomorrow my password
439:45 - will get
439:46 - expired and here you can see account
439:49 - expire expire uh it's on October 1
439:55 - 20202 okay but password uh last password
439:58 - change this and password will expire
440:00 - when in January 2022 yeah it's a little
440:03 - bit like illogical thing but yes you can
440:07 - understand because we have not I have
440:08 - just used this expiry date like uh
440:11 - normally okay so moving forward if you
440:14 - want to use the warning like uh Suppose
440:17 - there are 100 days after 100 pass will
440:19 - get expired but you want to war the user
440:21 - before 7 days then in that case you can
440:23 - use hyphen W
440:28 - option hyph W and suppose you want to
440:31 - war the user before 10
440:34 - days and uh here we got an error this is
440:38 - capital W set expiration warning days to
440:41 - warn days
440:45 - okay okay sudo
440:48 - hyen W1 yeah now
440:52 - done and here you can see number of days
440:56 - that is 10 as we provided
440:59 - here okay so in this way you can uh
441:02 - change the expiry date minimum days of
441:05 - required to change the password password
441:06 - validation warning days you can do all
441:10 - the things with this particular command
441:11 - and also you can do same things with
441:13 - password command also but yeah if you
441:15 - don't want to change the password then
441:17 - you can use this command normally like
441:19 - you don't need need to change the
441:20 - password again and again using password
441:22 - command okay so you have basically two
441:25 - commands to do this same thing that is
441:28 - password and this one what it was CHS
441:34 - okay so that's all for today's video
441:36 - guys and I hope you liked it if you have
441:38 - any queries you can ask in the comment
441:39 - section and we will meet you in the next
441:42 - video so thank you thank you for
441:45 - watching now in this video we're going
441:47 - to learn about the basic command that is
441:49 - NL command okay so basically this is a
441:51 - very simple command okay but sometimes
441:54 - it useful for Linux administrators in
441:56 - some cases okay so we will see the one
441:58 - uh use case and but before that we will
442:00 - create one file let me give the name as
442:03 - names.txt I will write some names here
442:07 - aush and
442:09 - ainos and uh
442:13 - Harry and uh I will write
442:16 - Ron and again let's take some another
442:19 - name that is uh
442:21 - um am okay I will re use contr D to save
442:26 - and now I just read this file names. txt
442:28 - but in this case you can see like there
442:30 - is no numbering here okay but sometimes
442:33 - we need to just get numbering like if
442:37 - you suppose this is a code uh if there
442:40 - is a code file and you need some
442:42 - numbering in that then we use this NL
442:45 - command to get the numbers so here you
442:49 - can see see that 1 2 3 4 5 is listed
442:53 - here okay so suppose if I create another
442:56 - file that is index. X
443:00 - HTML I write like body and I will write
443:04 - this
443:05 - H1 hello
443:09 - world and I'll just close the
443:12 - body contr D to save I will just read
443:15 - the file C index.html and you can see
443:18 - this we are able to read but now I want
443:21 - the line number of this file like of
443:23 - this code sometimes what happens uh like
443:28 - uh we get some kind of error in a
443:31 - particular line of code so in this case
443:33 - it is useful to like debug that error I
443:36 - will use this NL and I will just provide
443:38 - the name of the file what was it
443:41 - index.html and here you can see there 1
443:43 - 2 3 line number okay so I hope you got
443:46 - the what is the what will be the what
443:48 - can be the use of this NL command but
443:49 - yeah it's very simple so that's all for
443:52 - today's video guys and we will meet you
443:54 - in the next video uh with some amazing
443:57 - commands so that's all for today video
443:59 - and we'll meet you next one thank you
444:01 - thank you for watching we'll meet you in
444:03 - the next video thank you now in this
444:04 - video we are going to learn about the
444:06 - process in Linux Operating System case
444:08 - so basically in this video we're going
444:09 - to cover multiple things about the
444:11 - process what is the process what are the
444:13 - types of proc what is the P ID and
444:16 - basically we will surely learn about the
444:18 - basic concept of PS command we will just
444:20 - take an overview but in detail we will
444:22 - make a separate video about this on PS
444:24 - command Okay so let's start with the
444:27 - process if you are a cc student and if
444:29 - you are a operating system student also
444:32 - then I hope you are aware of process but
444:34 - if not then I'm here for you guys okay
444:36 - so let's start so what is the process so
444:39 - the basic and simple definition of
444:41 - process is execution of a
444:43 - program okay so now what many of you
444:47 - will ask me what is a program s so
444:49 - program is nothing but uh bu like
444:52 - whatever you write in a CPP code or a
444:55 - python code or a Java code that is a
444:56 - program and whenever you execute that
444:58 - program it becomes one of the process
445:01 - but uh if you take a real life example
445:03 - of a process here here you will see many
445:06 - apps are there if I will open Firefox
445:08 - that will become one of the process if I
445:10 - open this thunderboard that will become
445:12 - one of the process if you will open
445:13 - files that will become one of the
445:15 - process okay so as for definition
445:18 - process nothing but a execution of a
445:21 - program when you are executing any
445:23 - program then you are simply creating one
445:27 - process in your operating system okay
445:30 - now moving forward what is a p
445:33 - ID so p is nothing but uh you can say it
445:38 - like as a process ID it is created by
445:42 - the created by Machine by Linux
445:46 - machine and which what it does which
445:48 - uniquely
445:50 - identifies the process Suppose there are
445:53 - multiple processes going on in this
445:55 - Lance operating system so to identify
445:58 - each and every process there are a
446:00 - unique ID like if you are aware of the
446:02 - primary key of dbms so it's similar like
446:05 - that it unly identify each and every
446:07 - process okay or if you will get a real
446:11 - life example of account number so more
446:14 - than uh one account number cannot be
446:16 - associated with the two different people
446:19 - okay so similarly P also works like it
446:22 - uniquely identifies the particular
446:24 - process and also in Linux there are
446:27 - basically the we learn about the two
446:29 - types of processes mainly that is uh one
446:33 - is
446:35 - foreground okay and the second one is
446:39 - the background
446:41 - process so as a name suggest you might
446:44 - have guessed like what is the foreground
446:46 - and what is the background so foreground
446:48 - means whatever the process which are by
446:50 - the user so that is the forr if I will
446:52 - do
446:54 - here uh what I can do I can just do p
446:58 - this is one of the process if I will do
447:00 - who am I it is uh sorry who am I it is
447:04 - one of the process so whatever the user
447:07 - is entering the command or opening any
447:09 - kind of application or anything happen
447:11 - that is a example of the foreground
447:15 - process and now if you will talk about
447:17 - the background process then in this case
447:19 - uh what happens the operating system has
447:23 - multiple person which runs on the
447:25 - background as for example if you'll take
447:26 - an example of the Microsoft Word Ms word
447:30 - so in this what happen whatever you
447:32 - write in uh like in a what we say in a
447:37 - word then if uh any mistake happens
447:41 - spelling mistake then what happens in
447:43 - that case like uh it displays as the
447:46 - yeah this is your spelling mistake it
447:48 - like shows in color so how how is is it
447:52 - possible it's possible as the background
447:54 - process running on to check the spelling
447:56 - mistake you might have might happen Okay
447:59 - so this is the concept of the background
448:01 - process
448:02 - okay so in Linux we basically we can
448:05 - also create the background browser using
448:08 - uh I think some kind of
448:10 - ENT I think we use ENT to use the
448:13 - background process so yeah here you can
448:16 - see the 2
448:18 - 12510 P ID has has been created for this
448:21 - to create to do who Ami as the
448:24 - background process to stop this you can
448:26 - hit just control Z or contrl C contrl C
448:31 - okay so if I will do FS command so it
448:34 - will display me the foram process I
448:37 - think not
448:39 - FS I will need to like uh install this
448:43 - command FS or FB it is I'm not
448:45 - remembering like we will cover this all
448:47 - those command and all those in our next
448:50 - video FP is there maybe no not it's not
448:54 - there FP is not there uh let me remember
448:57 - the what is the concept what are the
448:59 - command for the checking for
449:03 - process yeah so FG is the commander to
449:08 - get the foreground process so here like
449:10 - no job is it is showing no job okay
449:15 - so if I do bz so bz also there is no
449:18 - background process going on as per this
449:21 - operating system so also we will learn
449:24 - about the some of the command like in
449:26 - the next lecture that is the PS command
449:29 - with which displays of the process State
449:31 - okay so right now it is displaying with
449:33 - the two like what we say two processes
449:37 - so let me first clear the screen and
449:39 - surely we will learn in detail about
449:41 - what is the PTY Time same in our next
449:43 - lecture but let me just show you the
449:46 - example of the foreground process so if
449:48 - I will open of this Firefox right let me
449:51 - just split the screen and I will just
449:53 - not Firefox I will open this uh let me
449:57 - open
449:58 - Firefox so right now currently it's
450:00 - showing me like this processor but for
450:03 - more you can check psone e okay so here
450:08 - you can see now Firefox is displaying
450:10 - here like 12 630 if I will
450:15 - close Okay and again I will check
450:18 - whether it is displaying me or not I
450:19 - will just check with it PSI
450:23 - fun okay so here you can see there is no
450:25 - Firefox but when I will open up so
450:28 - Firefox process will get added and it
450:32 - will display me the P ID of that Firefox
450:35 - so now again I just clear this screen
450:37 - and I will again I will enter this PSI
450:39 - so here you can see like now different p
450:42 - is being used for the Firefox now to
450:44 - stop this process you can use kill
450:46 - command also so kill command and the P
450:48 - ID that is the one
450:51 - 365 and now done so your fire FOC is
450:55 - Clos now so that's all about yeah guys
450:58 - about the process I hope you like it
450:59 - particular video and surely in our next
451:01 - lecture we will get to learn about the
451:03 - for forr how to get foreground
451:06 - background and the PS command okay so we
451:09 - will learn all about these three
451:11 - commands and the process States in our
451:14 - next lecture so thank you guys for
451:15 - watching this particular video and I
451:17 - hope you liked it and if you have any
451:18 - query then you can ask us in the comment
451:20 - section thank you guys and we'll meet
451:22 - you in the next one thank
451:24 - you hello guys now in this particular
451:26 - video we're going to learn about the PS
451:28 - command okay so basically what is a PS
451:30 - command why we use it we will discuss
451:32 - each and everything in this
451:34 - particular video okay so what is this PS
451:37 - but before that me just increase the
451:39 - font size now I hope it is visible so PS
451:41 - is nothing but uh process State what
451:45 - does it mean it basically means it just
451:47 - gives us the information about state of
451:49 - any process okay it we will get the P ID
451:54 - of a number name of the command who is
451:56 - the user using that particular process
451:58 - so we will get each and every
452:00 - information about the process but before
452:02 - starting and going into the deep Insight
452:04 - of this topic uh you should know what is
452:07 - a process process nothing but a
452:09 - execution of program when I open this
452:12 - Firefox it will become one of the
452:14 - process when I will hit this particular
452:16 - thing it will become one of the process
452:18 - I know it is
452:20 - like any command but still if I will
452:23 - open any this music rhythm box then it
452:26 - will become of the process process is
452:29 - nothing but the execution of a program
452:32 - okay so now let's
452:34 - uh play with this PS command so when you
452:37 - will enter the PS it basically gives you
452:40 - the uh like status of this current shell
452:43 - what are the processes running in this
452:45 - particular uh cell like this is one of
452:47 - the cell if I will open another window
452:50 - of terminal it will give me another
452:51 - shell okay so here you can see we are
452:55 - just getting this PS the command which
452:58 - entered just and this is the bash is one
453:00 - of the like you can say a shell which
453:04 - acts like a parent uh uh process like
453:08 - some other process use this bash to
453:10 - execute some kind of uh their task okay
453:14 - so now let's basically talk about what
453:16 - are these four types of uh like what is
453:18 - this like P TTY okay so let's start with
453:22 - the p
453:24 - ID okay so what is a p is nothing but
453:27 - the process ID what does it mean it
453:30 - basically gives us you the unique
453:32 - identification number of a process like
453:36 - uh uh let me tell you the example of
453:39 - suppose in a family member uh each and
453:41 - everyone will have the different name
453:44 - okay not like uh two person will have
453:47 - the same name in a group of like family
453:50 - of of two to not two five to six members
453:53 - okay similarly this p is there like
453:55 - process ID it uniquely identifies each
453:58 - and every process in this operating
454:00 - system okay it just gives you the
454:03 - particular number of four digit and all
454:05 - so I hope that is clear to you what is a
454:07 - process ID now moving forward that is
454:09 - TTI is nothing but a terminal type it
454:11 - gives you the information about the what
454:13 - type ofal is being used by the
454:15 - user let me just write uh terminal type
454:20 - and yeah if you are just watching this
454:21 - video so don't just keep watching uh
454:24 - make notes also so that will be helpful
454:27 - for you for your further use now this is
454:29 - a time is nothing but the CPU
454:32 - utilization time by the process so here
454:34 - it is zero because no any other process
454:37 - using this
454:38 - bash shell or bash command okay so this
454:42 - is CPU
454:44 - utilization
454:47 - thing okay now moving forward the CMD is
454:50 - nothing but the command which is used by
454:52 - like what commands have been applied for
454:54 - this particular
454:56 - process okay so I hope it is clear to
454:59 - you like what is p TTY time CMD okay now
455:04 - moving forward now you will be thinking
455:07 - about why there is only two processors
455:09 - displaying because it PS by default
455:12 - displays the current uh process in a
455:15 - current shell okay so to get more
455:19 - information for the different processes
455:20 - like on a boot time there are multiple
455:22 - processor runs like on booting of system
455:26 - so let me just uh enter this PS I from a
455:31 - so here you can see there are the
455:33 - multiple processes you can see like what
455:35 - other the commands has been used like uh
455:38 - system
455:40 - D SCSI
455:43 - paide okay this one colored so there are
455:47 - many processes here you can see in this
455:50 - particular like screen so here you can
455:53 - see the PS command is also there like
455:56 - the P
455:57 - 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is
456:00 - that like if the PS command fures the
456:02 - result from this particular
456:04 - directory P here if you do LS then here
456:07 - you will get the information about the
456:09 - particular
456:13 - thing okay so uh in this particular
456:16 - directory you can see many files are
456:18 - there like like like it basically
456:20 - fetches the particular information from
456:23 - this particular directory okay now wait
456:26 - just move it on to the RO directory now
456:29 - moving forward uh suppose I just uh
456:33 - create one process okay let me just
456:36 - create one process but before that I
456:38 - want to tell you one command that is one
456:41 - option that is PS Hy C Discount
456:44 - basically option what basically it does
456:47 - it basically uh like gives the
456:49 - information about the particular process
456:50 - which you want okay in case if you want
456:53 - to get information about the particular
456:54 - process uh then you can hit the name of
456:57 - that particular process here suppose I
456:59 - need the information about the Firefox
457:00 - okay which is now it's not running so I
457:03 - can get this so now what I will do I
457:05 - will just first clear this screen and I
457:06 - will open up this particular Firefox so
457:10 - now what will happen when I will click
457:11 - on this Firefox one process is getting
457:14 - created and then the P ID is given to
457:16 - that particular process and you will see
457:18 - that in this like uh now in a seconds
457:22 - okay so let's wait now you can see the
457:25 - this Firefox has been started now I will
457:27 - use this PS hyphen C and the name of the
457:30 - person that is the
457:33 - Firefox so here you can see like from 10
457:35 - seconds it is utilizing the CPU and the
457:38 - PID is given and the command is using
457:41 - like Firefox okay like you will say like
457:46 - you not use this command but yeah
457:49 - let me show you if I will hit into
457:51 - Firefox the Firefox again the one
457:53 - terminal Firefox will start okay it's
457:56 - say fail to
457:57 - load yeah but some module is fit but
458:00 - it's still here you can see one Firefox
458:01 - window has been appeared if I just close
458:04 - it okay so that uh this is the first
458:08 - one okay so in this way you can see the
458:11 - information about the particular process
458:14 - uh and if let me just enter one more
458:17 - command if I will hit here cat and it is
458:20 - now in the weight State like it is just
458:23 - what we can say asking for the user
458:26 - input whatever I will write and anything
458:28 - okay it is just waiting for the user
458:30 - input so I can use this command also
458:34 - yeah like I will write your cat and here
458:37 - you can see the PID is assigned to this
458:39 - particular
458:40 - process okay so now what I will do uh if
458:44 - I want to just uh kill any process I
458:47 - want to just uh
458:49 - whatever you can say discard any kind
458:51 - any process then I can use the kill
458:53 - command and I will just give pass the
458:55 - parameter as this P
458:57 - ID so I will just enter this P 739 and
459:01 - then here you will see like uh let's see
459:04 - what happens so here you can see
459:05 - terminated the cat is now
459:08 - terminated and similarly you can do for
459:11 - this uh what you can say for Firefox
459:14 - also but before that uh let me just uh
459:17 - use hyphen a option to again view the
459:19 - all the processes so when I will clear
459:22 - not I will clear this just do PS hyph a
459:26 - and here you can
459:28 - see uh what is the P
459:32 - 6214 let me check whether it is visible
459:35 - or not yeah here you can see the 62 6214
459:39 - p is generated okay what if I will kill
459:43 - this 6214 what will happen the Firefox
459:46 - window will get closed okay
459:49 - so you can see now again I will use PS I
459:52 - so here you can see there is no 6214 and
459:55 - also no there is web content uh like
459:58 - what you can say web content command or
460:01 - any process is not displaying here as
460:03 - you can see in the previous command here
460:05 - let me just move back here you can see
460:07 - the web content process was also there
460:09 - so in this what has happened the 6214 P
460:12 - was the parent process and under this
460:15 - process there are many other processes
460:17 - like here you can see the
460:19 - web extensions web content and all those
460:22 - things
460:23 - okay so in this way we can uh use this
460:26 - PS command to get the process of uh any
460:30 - particular uh application or any command
460:34 - okay now moving forward about another
460:36 - option that is the PS hyph U okay so
460:41 - what this basically it will do what uh
460:45 - this Con do so hyphen new option is B
460:48 - basically used to giving the like you
460:50 - want to get information over the some
460:52 - particular user so if I use I I will get
460:56 - this
460:57 - information so these are the process
460:59 - which are being used by my
461:02 - command not by my command sorry uh by me
461:06 - actually I is one of the user of this
461:07 - operating system if I use
461:13 - R hyph you root so you can see the uh
461:18 - these are some processor which are being
461:20 - used by
461:22 - the root user okay so also there are uh
461:26 - one more option that is the Au option PS
461:29 - command which is used for uh getting
461:31 - detailed information about the processes
461:34 - so PS hyph Au just plays the result in
461:37 - more detailed format okay so here you
461:40 - can see the name of the user is uh like
461:44 - display like whatever user is using this
461:46 - particular command this particular
461:49 - process and the virtual memory
461:52 - utilization TTY terminal type stat start
461:55 - when the process started so here you can
461:57 - see the 549 at 549 actually I had
462:00 - started my the system so it is
462:02 - displaying like on Bo time this process
462:05 - has been started so you can see all the
462:09 - information but now here you can see at
462:11 - 61 this
462:13 - process and now at 659 this command was
462:17 - done was uh
462:21 - used
462:22 - okay so in this way you can get the
462:24 - detailed information about
462:27 - uh your process okay also you can use
462:32 - psyph a to get the running processes so
462:36 - here you can see these are the running
462:39 - processes
462:41 - okay uh okay yeah this is the time
462:44 - command start
462:47 - okay so that's all for today's videoos
462:49 - guide I hope you liked it and it was a
462:52 - very uh interesting thing like to get
462:54 - the like what are the processes being
462:57 - used in your operating system if you
462:59 - learn more about this you will get to
463:01 - learn also more like um when you will
463:04 - explore personally then obviously you
463:06 - will get to learn more about this so
463:09 - that's all for this video and we'll meet
463:11 - you in the next one with another
463:12 - interesting command uh okay so maybe I
463:15 - will create video on top command after
463:17 - this so let make in the next one so
463:19 - thank you for watching
463:22 - bye-bye now in this video we're going to
463:24 - learn about the top command Okay so
463:26 - before starting this video first of all
463:28 - let me tell you about the what is the
463:30 - top command okay so if you have learned
463:32 - about the PS command like which gives us
463:35 - the process States of uh like of all
463:37 - this system similarly top command is
463:39 - also one of the command which lies under
463:41 - the process management okay we can get
463:44 - the uh information about the different
463:46 - processes like what is the p that
463:48 - particular process how much memory is
463:51 - being used by that process okay we will
463:53 - see all the details and what are the
463:55 - users and what the users using that
463:57 - particular process so everything we're
463:59 - going to see about in this particular
464:00 - video so we will start with the simple
464:02 - and basic command that is a top simple
464:05 - when you hit Top then it will show you
464:07 - the details about the other running
464:10 - different running processes by different
464:11 - users and all those things okay uh but
464:13 - before that let me just increase the
464:15 - size of my terminal I hope this ible to
464:18 - you I'll just hit Top
464:20 - okay so here you can see the P ID the
464:24 - what P ID what does it mean I will tell
464:26 - you everything about the all these three
464:28 - what is these all things okay but before
464:31 - that I will need to separate like this
464:33 - the screen and I will just open one
464:35 - command line
464:36 - also okay so here you can see what is
464:39 - the P
464:41 - ID P just Define the process ID like
464:45 - uh if you don't know about P let me tell
464:47 - you like like like uh every device has a
464:51 - unique Mac address similarly p is just
464:53 - like that like it is it uniquely
464:55 - identifies each processes whatever the
464:58 - process is created by the user then the
465:01 - our system assigns some P to that
465:04 - particular process to uniquely identify
465:06 - that process similar that is
465:08 - the process ID okay moving forward if
465:12 - you will see the user so user section
465:14 - just defines like who is the user
465:19 - using that
465:22 - particular
465:24 - process uh don't give attention on
465:26 - spelling M Stakes okay that is not
465:29 - important here right now so what is PR
465:31 - PR is just uh like
465:34 - priority okay what is the priority of
465:36 - that command so the thing is that if the
465:40 - your what we say the number is lower so
465:43 - it should have the higher priority you
465:45 - can see the zero so these processors
465:47 - have should have higher priority okay
465:50 - like you can see 20us 51 so it is you
465:54 - can see 2020 everything is there like so
465:58 - here you can write the lower the
466:03 - number higher the
466:05 - priority what does priority mean
466:07 - basically like this process like for if
466:10 - something happens to the more priority
466:13 - command or more priority process then
466:16 - the CPU users should like not CP uses
466:20 - just think like example Suppose there
466:22 - are two processes A and B and B the
466:27 - priority of B is low but priority of a
466:29 - is high okay if some Interruption
466:32 - happens with it then then a can use more
466:35 - CPU uses you can say like that okay so
466:39 - this is the defines the P like what is
466:41 - the prity of that particular process of
466:44 - command and for the you will see here it
466:47 - is V which basically defines the virtual
466:51 - memory used by the task okay it is I
466:56 - think it's in KB it is in KB okay so
467:00 - that's why it's showing like bigger
467:03 - number okay so it is virtually you can
467:07 - say not virtually virtual
467:09 - memory used by the task okay moving
467:14 - forward what is this rest so rest is uh
467:18 - what we can say I think it is the
467:20 - physical RAM yeah the command used like
467:24 - whatever the process is running like how
467:26 - much RAM this is particular using like
467:29 - this particular process how much RAM it
467:30 - is using so also in the KB this data is
467:34 - in KB okay and uh moving forward if you
467:38 - will talk about the shr so shr is
467:41 - nothing but a shared memory it also in
467:43 - KB okay and then the percentage CPU
467:47 - percentage memory time and what are the
467:49 - other option you can see here uh where
467:52 - it is time plus command all those things
467:55 - like this is this uh this show the uh
467:59 - which command uh like after entering
468:02 - which command this process is running
468:04 - okay so here you can see all those
468:07 - things okay if I will just uh yeah wait
468:10 - a minute what I will do first I will
468:13 - just stop this stop command and I will
468:17 - again run that top command and I will
468:19 - show you one thing okay so here you can
468:21 - see the top command is running okay like
468:24 - different processes coming here and
468:26 - there okay now what I will do uh but
468:29 - command is not visible let me just
468:31 - string create this one yeah yeah now you
468:34 - can see the command is visible if I do
468:36 - Control Alt T and I will hit this F Fox
468:40 - Okay so this command what it will do it
468:41 - will just create a new process okay and
468:44 - then again you can see here if I will
468:47 - hit enter in this particular terminal
468:49 - then Firefox will come up there and some
468:53 - P will be assigned to that so here you
468:55 - can see which command is this Firefox
468:57 - and the particular time you can see how
468:59 - much CPU uses per memory plus virtual
469:03 - memory okay and RAM also and who is the
469:06 - user I is the user and the P ID is
469:11 - 4790 okay so in this way this particular
469:15 - top Comm Works which dis play you the
469:19 - particular information about any
469:21 - particular process okay so now what we
469:25 - have to do uh if you want to just uh
469:28 - what you can see uh you can say like if
469:30 - you want to get information about the
469:32 - particular user like uh some let's
469:35 - suppose I want to get information about
469:37 - the I user what process is being used by
469:39 - that particular user so I can use those
469:42 - command also okay but before moving to
469:45 - that uh I will just tell you one thing
469:48 - like if you want to kill any process
469:50 - while using top command how you can do
469:51 - it you have to just in this particular
469:54 - terminal uh let me just increase this
469:56 - one
469:58 - okay uh where it is
470:03 - uh I think this
470:06 - one yeah this one Firefox is running
470:09 - Firefox p is what 4790 now what do you
470:12 - have to just hit K so when you will
470:15 - enter K so here you can see p to Signal
470:18 - default P ID is 1622 so here you can do
470:22 - uh like enter the PID of the process
470:25 - which you want to kill or which you want
470:26 - to close so if I will search for fir
470:30 - Fox I think it was
470:34 - 4790 okay so let me
470:39 - just Saed
470:42 - this okay uh yeah here you can see 4790
470:46 - is some Pro
470:50 - is let me just increase this one the
470:54 - width of
470:55 - it so 4790 I'm not able to see 479 here
471:00 - you can see 4790 is this one so I'll
471:02 - just hit K and I will write enter
471:05 - 4790 enter and here you can see the what
471:08 - happen when you kill the command um not
471:12 - command when you kill the process then
471:14 - you need to give the particular signal
471:16 - so in this i h 15
471:18 - so you can see like Firefox has been
471:21 - closed and also here you can see the
471:23 - terminated okay so why I entered the p
471:28 - uh 15 because like it's kind of signal
471:32 - which we use with the kill command okay
471:34 - so we will talk about the kill command
471:36 - in some another particular video okay
471:38 - now moving forward what I was telling
471:40 - about to get information about the posst
471:43 - used by some particular user so how you
471:45 - can see you uh like how you can do that
471:47 - what we have to do you have to just
471:48 - enter
471:51 - top hyphen U and the name of the user
471:54 - I and D here you can see all the
471:57 - processors which are being used by this
471:58 - particular user oh I think multiple
472:01 - processor being
472:03 - used okay so in this way you can get
472:06 - information about particular user if you
472:08 - want to like if you work in a corporate
472:10 - world and you get like as a un
472:13 - administrator then in that case it will
472:15 - be very useful like to know like which
472:18 - user is using what kind of processes
472:20 - when something happens then you can
472:22 - see okay and also there are multiple
472:24 - things like uh you can if you will hit Z
472:27 - then the running process color will get
472:29 - converted into this what we what red
472:33 - color and if you will do press uh like
472:36 - what you can say if you press
472:38 - C then you will get the path of
472:42 - particular command like for which in
472:44 - which path that command is particular
472:45 - running so here you can see The genome
472:47 - cell is in user bin
472:50 - directory and many more things here it
472:52 - is
472:54 - okay so that's all for today's videos
472:56 - guys I hope you liked it and if you have
472:58 - any quer then you can ask in the comment
472:59 - section so thank you thank you for
473:00 - watching and I will meet you in the next
473:02 - video thank
473:03 - you now in this video we're going to
473:05 - learn about the kill command Okay so
473:07 - already we have covered the PS command
473:09 - and the top command okay so in this
473:11 - video we are going to learn about how we
473:13 - can kill a particular process or you can
473:15 - see the how we can terminate a
473:16 - particular process process sometimes
473:18 - what happens in our case like you open a
473:21 - Firefox or any application and it
473:23 - becomes unresponsive okay and at that
473:25 - time you cannot access that application
473:26 - and you cannot use that particular
473:28 - application so in that case you need to
473:31 - just uh you want to just terminate that
473:34 - process or close that application anyhow
473:36 - okay so for that purpose we can use the
473:39 - kill command and also you can normally
473:41 - you can also use that Kil command okay
473:43 - to close any application or toate that
473:45 - particular process so how you can do it
473:47 - so there is a separate command in our
473:49 - Linux system that is a
473:51 - kill okay so kill is the command you can
473:55 - use okay so there are the many signals
473:59 - provided by this particular command you
474:01 - can get those signal using the kill
474:03 - hyphen L option so here it will list all
474:06 - the signals which you can use but mostly
474:09 - used signal is the 15 this one signal
474:13 - terminate and also you can use the
474:16 - signal kill signal kill okay so these
474:19 - are the signal which are used mostly by
474:22 - the kill command to kill particular
474:24 - process so to demonstrate
474:27 - you I will just uh uh open up the
474:31 - Firefox using this terminal I will hit P
474:37 - Firefox and Firefox will start and I
474:40 - will just enter the
474:44 - PS and PS hyph a to show all the process
474:49 - so here you will see the Firefox P
474:53 - ID that is
474:55 - 8796 okay so I have got the PID of
474:59 - Firefox okay so with the help of PID I
475:04 - can dominate this particular process
475:06 - soid is
475:08 - 8796 okay so but there is many ways to
475:11 - terminate particular process you can
475:13 - just terminate that process using the
475:15 - PID as well using that signal and the
475:18 - name of that like signal term signal
475:22 - kill and also without signal so I will
475:25 - just show you each and everything okay
475:28 - so you can just do
475:30 - kill that is p ID is
475:34 - 8796 okay using PID or you can just do
475:37 - hyphone
475:38 - 15 okay that is 8796 so what it will do
475:42 - it will just skill that particular
475:43 - process that you can see the terminated
475:45 - Okay so also you can do how you can do
475:48 - it but now I will not open the uh
475:51 - Firefox I will just use cat command cat
475:54 - home okay and I will just use PSAT to
475:59 - check the p is 9405 okay so here I can
476:03 - use kill hyph SI signal and I will use
476:08 - Tom and I will just enter the p number
476:12 - that is a 945 and hit enter and you can
476:15 - see the that particular uh process
476:19 - terminated and also you can do like this
476:22 - also like SI without SI you can
476:26 - also use this command so I will again
476:29 - use this one and I will first check the
476:31 - what is the process of cat because
476:34 - process ID changes again and again that
476:36 - is 9417 this time and I will use 9417
476:40 - and you can see the process terminated
476:42 - okay so in this way you can use the kill
476:44 - command okay now uh now let's use some
476:48 - another signal also so if I will use PS
476:51 - hyph L uh not PS
476:54 - sorry kill
476:57 - hyl so I will use this one uh kill so
477:01 - let me check how it works I will use
477:03 - this kill Hy 9 and the process name that
477:08 - is the
477:10 - cat no not process
477:13 - name p
477:15 - ID so 94
477:19 - 431 K Hy 9
477:22 - 9431 hit enter and here you can see the
477:25 - process is killed okay so in this way
477:28 - you can use this kill command to
477:29 - terminate any process or kill any
477:31 - process so if that process is
477:33 - unresponsive or that any application is
477:35 - unresponsive so in that case you can use
477:37 - this particular command Okay so that's
477:39 - all for the today video guys and I hope
477:42 - you likeed and if you have any queries
477:43 - you can ask us in the comment section
477:45 - okay so I meet in the next video thank
477:48 - you thank you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the channel this is aush and from today we are going to start our Linux Series so today in this tutorial we are going to cover the installation of Linux operating system that is we are going to install basically ubu and we will see the basic comp concept of virtual box what is virtual box and why we will use it okay so let's start with the first virtual box so virtual box is nothing but one kind of software uh that we use to run different operating system in our main host okay so our main host here means that our one this operating system that that this one which I'm using right now that is Windows 11 okay so in this operating system we are going to use another operating system with the help of virtual box okay I hope that is clear to you like what is a virtual box okay so basically we will uh install obuntu OS but before that you will need to first of all install virtual box so how you can do it you have to just go on this particular website watchbox dog and you have to click on this download watchbox 6.1 and and then according to your host you can download it if I hope it's windows so you can just click on Windows host okay this will download the uh installation file and actually I have already installed it I already downloaded this file so I will just cancel this okay and let me go here here you can see I have this file okay so what you have to do you have to just click double click on it and it will just ask for the administration permission you have to just click yes and then it will start uh installation actually I have already installed virtual book that's why it's coming like it first of all I will remove it okay let me remove it first then again it will install okay it will take little bit of time don't worry for it okay uh we will wait uh but uh till now I pause the video okay so guys my virtual box has been already uh like uh uninstalled now again I will click on this particular file and just uh hit on yes it will start uh okay so just you have to click next then you have to make sure all the options are tick marked you have to click yes then yes then install and it will take just approx 5 minute of time not more than that okay uh first of all let uh be let it install and yeah it's install I think after that I will tell you the about the installation part of the bu operating system so one operating system is nothing but a Linux distro okay so I will cover all that point in the next video and here you can see the uh like virtual box is installed and just click on finished and the virtual box will come up okay so here you can see my virtual box has been loaded and the don't worry about these files because I had already these files with me so don't worry about it I will tell you the uh installation part of ubun operating system okay so what you have to do now you have to go on the you have to just search UB okay nothing else then you have to just go on this download section or you can go by this.com download and here you see the one to desktop you have to click on it and then make sure the version of I'm using I'm also using this uh current version you have to just hit download okay and the download will start and also I have already downloaded this file also and you can see the file size is approx 3.4 GB okay so if you have WiFi then it's good if you not then you will need some extra it okay I have already installed it so I will just cancel it you can see the file here one to desktop same version okay 20224 so what I will do now uh this is my virtual War I will just hit new I will just name my OS I will name it to and make sure uh don't change it now for like don't change the location as maybe you can get face some error okay and here the type is Linux and this is all default okay you will get the same you have just click on next make sure you provide the size more than 4 GB at least and if you uh 4 sorry if you have a ram of laptop approx 4 GB Ram then make sure like you provide half of it otherwise your laptop will hang okay so now click on next create a virtual hard disk click on next dynamically allocated next and here you can provide the size which you want to provide to that particular OS I will provide Max to Max 50gb okay you can also provide it appox according to your si okay I'll just hit on Create and you can see the my machine has been created and now what I will need to do I will need to click on next so the total installation I think it takes approx of uh 20 25 minutes maybe 30 minutes sometimes and here you can see you have to just select that particular file I will just click on this and then click on ADD I will select my file here just click on open and then choose okay and you have selected that ISO file now you have to just hit a start okay so it will take some time and then you have to just SOL click enter h enter and it will take some time of approx 5 minutes okay uh I will pause the video and when the another screen come I will resume okay now you can see guys uh this window has come up now it will ask for the installation so let's wait that box takes 30 minutes I'm guess yeah now here you can see uh you have to select the language uh it should be English and then you have to just click on install OBU and again uh the same thing like keyboard layout what you want so I need English so I will just hit on continue then again continue it's taking much time and then you have to just hit on install now continue then uh like my Reon is in India so it's been already selected you can also choose according to you and just hitting continue now you have to provide a username so you can my username will be I choose as iush and my password make sure you remember your password because we will need it again and again so you have to just make sure you have selected this option recover my password to login okay then click on continue and now it will like copy all the files and uh install theant Okay so uh I will pause this video after the complete installation I will be back okay so you can see file has been almost copied okay now the installation will start okay so it will also take aox 5 to 10 minute of time now guys you can see like at appro half of our has has installed so it just unpacking all the libraries and then retriving files stowing so you will learn more about uh operating system like how will be the file structure what are the commands that we will use uh in our the playlist okay so let it be complete so it's also installing I think different softwares and here also you can see like uh this while installing it's showing everything you need for the office all these things you can check okay here we will get the Firefox web browser and the photo applications we will get uh yeah whe Spotify so as this so is will be little bit different for the windows users uh like who are using Windows from his childhood or her childhood okay so this will be basically some kind of command line BAS things so at you will get some real time skills okay like that will be helpful in the corporate also or if you want to go in the uh domain of cyber security there is also need of uh this uh Linux OS so that will be very helpful for you so uh leter install I will be right back after the complete installation so now you can see guys like now it will install as there was uh some kind of packages it's so it was installing uh just before I resume the video now it should not take much time it will take I think little bit of time it'll just the whatever the packages that has installed by the system then it will just unpack all the all those things so let's wait for it don't know how much time will it take unpacking LX headers okay nice I should not take much time I don't know why it's taking much time packing head so okay preparing now it's preparing so guys now you can see our installation has been completed and this is the like information box you will get after the come after the successful installation now it's asking to restart now so I'll just hit on restart now then it will ask for the whatever the username and the password which you have entered at the time of installation then that those things you will need to enter okay so it is asking for the remove installation please okay I have to just hit enter so so you will also need to hit enter okay so now it will start and after that uh I will tell you something important uh like as you can see how the this size of that particular schem is on little much uh but uh I know like we don't like to do on like the small window so we will check uh how we can increase the particular screen size to full screen okay so first of all we will need to log in into the system then we will need to do some changes in it then we can easily uh go into the full screen mode as this is the first time so that's why it's taking a little bit of more time as compared to like uh all installed system so let's wait for it now here you can see uh now your username whatever you entered so I had entered the name iush I will just click on it and I will need to just hit the password okay then hit enter it will take little bit of time to configure everything yeah here we go so congratulations you have successfully install operting system okay so it will ask for the some kind of these thing if you want to link this with the Google account then you can go otherwise you can just skip it okay it's not mandatory to it to do it and then also so click on next then if you want to install some kind of software into this O then you can do it otherwise you can also click on done okay so now you can see uh this is our OS uh which is installed successfully but uh you can see the screen sizes too small for the use okay so for that what we will need to do we will need to first of all uh like um let me do one thing I will just uh uh uh I will just power off the window you can do by the control alt T then this terminal will open and you have to just enter enter one command power off now your system has been successfully installed just we have to do one thing like we have to do the full screen mode okay so we will just go in the setting and then again in the display and you have to do it full to 128 MB and then you have to just enable the 3D acceleration and make sure your storage is it's showing empty but what we will need we will need to do just add optical drive and we will just add this one vbox gu edition. ISO we'll choose it and then on the empty what we will do we will just do right click and we will remove this particular attachment and then you have to go click on okay and here you can see where vbx get something okay now what we will do we will just restart our system for now again we will need to enter the username and password not username only password we will need to wait okay yeah now we can just uh hit the password and then show the screen buddy yes now uh you will just uh scroll down then you you will see this uh vbox gas okay so you have to just just uh click on it and then here you have to just hit the right click and then open in terminal and here we have to just hit this command do slash auto run Dosh okay so this is uh what's coming software catalog is being downloaded no I don't want this right now just close button this is/ a. this is basically a cell script file that we will run Okay just set enter and it will ask for the authentication authenticate now it will install some some files okay then after the complete installation again we will need to restart our this machine and then you can easily uh set the particular um like we will get the whole screen okay uh till now uh let's do some kind uh of Surfing this OS so here you can see the Firefox is there and this is Thunder B mail we can use as a mail this is the file system Rhythm box I think it's some kind of music player okay so here you can see the play install the GCC make p package from distribution okay it will install it so you don't have to do anything now here you can see the will not rep until system started okay uh I will need to hit enter I think yeah just hit enter and again one thing will come up here then after that we will need to hit enter okay just wait for it yeah now it's been done okay now what we will need to do uh we will need to just uh restart the system you can hit the command reboot now it should be done with the password I think it's not done let me check from here this is the V box guest Edition what is there there is also the same thing it should happen Okay let me show the screen bro yeah yeah now done okay so what I just hit it uh just right control and then press F okay when you will do do it you will go in the full screen and again you will then do the right control and then have F then you will get this the whole screen now it looks nice now on pressing Control Alt T you can get the terminal on or by just hitting here I will just uh close it and uh I think here you can see activities and the trash and here the all application which you can see and then from here you can just click on the terminal and now the terminal will open up okay or the shortcut is control alt T so here I'm just entering the command who am I this is the basic Linux command so here you can see it's showing the name as iush okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you have successful in install the Linux operating system or you can s to OS in your PC using virtual box so that's all for today so do like share and subscribe programming knowledge and uh I'll meet you in the next video thank you thank you for watching so now here is our uh Linux system uh which we had already installed yesterday if you have not watched the previous video then please go and watch that video because without this uh you will not be able to follow us okay uh if you have already installed then it's fine if you have not installed then you can go for it okay so now what we have to do we have to first off all learn the one of the basic command like LS command but before that you should have some familiarity with this uh uh like envirment Linux envirment like here you can see the browser web browser mail here you can see the files that just like in our Windows system there is the this one file explorer similarly here is also that thing okay you can access the different folders documents uh and then downloads music whatever thing you will download from web browser it will get downloaded in this particular video uh in this particular sorry uh download for directory and here is some public uh folder and there is nothing okay and also you will get the trash videos pictures all these things okay so these are the all things which you will get so now what we have have to do we you you will need to first of all open up the terminal uh you can go from uh here and then you can click on Terminal okay but uh also there is a shortcut for opening the terminal is the control alt T okay so now I will cut this and you can just hit control alt and then D so it will like open one of the terminal so this is our terminal and on this particular thing we will work so let me maximize it I hope it is visible to you okay just wait a minute uh you know it should be visible to you guys okay so uh the First Command which we will uh learn about in this video is the ls command so what is LS command first we will talk about this what is LS command uh just think about LS s is nothing but the list the content so we use the ls command to list the contents of a particular directory okay if you are suppose you are in desktop directory so you want to get all the what are the files what are the director in that particular desktop if you want to get it so you will use a simple command that is called as LS command okay so what we will do we'll just hit LS okay so now I'm in the home folder and where you can the desktop documents downloads music pictures and all these things okay so what I will do for the purpose of uh showing you I will just open up the files in my here on my screen I will try to minimize it okay yeah here you can see I'm already on the home directory okay from here you can see also uh I hope it's visible let me minimize the size of this particular window yeah now here you can see uh this is the home and the same content which uh we are getting also here okay so this is the uh main purpose of the command LS so this is the basic uh work which it does like it just list the content of that particular um folder or particular directory in which you are present so if I will go in the desktop and here you can see one file has been created desktop so now what we will do we will just uh here click on open it terminal okay and then now you can see where are you you are in the desktop now here when you will do LS so here also you can see you are getting that particular directory test as it is okay so I hope you got the idea about how the ls Works what are the main person purpose behind this okay so now what we will I will talk about with you is the flags or you can see say the options or arguments so there are many options or arguments which we use with the ls command okay so I will use uh uh so you the first one is L hyphen L that is small l so this is the basically the format or you can say the Syntax for the like commands like there will be command name then hyph then the whatever the option which you want to provide with it so what this command will basically do hyphen L just stands for the long format okay it will show you the all the files and act in the long format so I will just hit enter and now you will Le think like wow what what is this now you will get a bit of confused about it okay so let me tell you about these things like um these are these are the some permissions okay uh like read write execute uh there will be a separate video on this permission because this is a very important topic okay and then there is a users user name group name this is the file size and the dates and all and the last modification date uh time so the uh I had created The One desktop folder at 153 a.m. so that's why it is showing at uh this time 153 okay so now what I will do uh I will create one folder in documents okay and here I will do new folder and here I will give it the name as uh LS command okay here you can see the documents folder and in that we have a LS command now what I will do I will just again hit the ls iel here now you can see the last modification time of that particular uh directory document is 217 and here also you can say it's now 218 now okay I hope you got the idea about this hyphen L format like it basically displays you the result in the long format okay so this is the main purpose of this L hyphen L flag now uh let me talk you uh about some other flags like H flag okay so H flag basically uh does the like it will show you the format in the human rable format okay like as you can see this is a 4096 you will not get what is this basically it is the file size okay and uh if I will do hyphen Ed then you will get some difference uh let me create one more terminal so that you can differentiate between both the result okay minimize it uh my batter is low okay now what I will do here LS hyphen L hyph HED okay we can use the separate uh as a separate flag or we can just combine both together I will show you after this okay don't worry about it so here now you can see this is showing me the human form what is 36 it is 36 KB and then 4 KB 4 KB 4 KB this is the size of all like directories and there is some uh basic concept about it I will tell you later in that particular video when we will come across with the more description about these things like it is basically related to the hard link soft soft link kind of concept in Linux okay so as this is a beginner purpose video so we'll not cover this at this time otherwise you will get confused okay so uh we I had used LS hyph l hyph h okay so now what I will do I'll just combine both things okay hyphen LH as you can see there will be no difference and it will also not uh no like it will also not provide me like this command is basically like unvalid or anything else so you can see we can write like this also or we can write like this also so now uh one more command you will need now the clear command what this command will do I hope you guessed it right this will just clear all the this screen okay I will just hit enter and yeah boom you got clear okay now uh let move about some other flags which we will use the simple flag is also the a flag what it does you will uh understand like it will list all the files and directory okay uh the hidden file files also it will show us and here you can see we are getting the this bash history log out bash RC file all these files which we we are getting here okay now let me show you here also so you will get idea about it how it's working you can go here and it should be somewhere like hidden files uh yeah here you can see the so hidden files is unchecked now we will check it and then yeah boom you can see the same result as we have BC and here is also the BC file and other some files which are present here also okay so for now I am again unchecking it so it should be simple okay so now uh we can combine the hyl option with this also like Al we are getting the same thing but what in the long format okay like this is the same permissions numbers some kind of and the i i this is the username and group and root root is the root user who like we will get about this what is root and all these things when you when we will learn about the user creation things in Linux okay so uh I hope you got it the hyphen L option also okay uh let me tell you one more uh flag which are important here like uh hyphen LD okay uh what we will do in this when we will uh combine the L with d directory d stands for directory and want to get the details of the Let's uh get documents directory uh yeah now here we can see you you are getting the details of a specific directory that is documents okay and here is the same thing that we were getting earlier like uh you can match it with it like documents and here also you can see the permissions users group size and the last modification time okay this is the LD so these are the some basic uh uh Flags which you can use with the ls command okay and uh that's all for today also if you want more uh like U practice on it you can go here also on uh try Haack me.com like this is a platform on which there is a Linux uh uh tutorials or something you can say uh uh wait a minute yeah I think I got it here m in the loar it should be in the learning path or somewhere else yeah Linux fundamentals okay if you want um more indepth knowledge or you want to practice some your skills then you can go on this platform also okay so uh that's all for today and I hope you you understood about the ls command if you they see Linux is just like about your practice if you do more practice you will get more familiar with it like uh uh like when I had started it was like what is this thing and what is this terminal I was get scared of this but when you start practicing with it when you play with this uh then you will get a idea about yes uh you can understand it okay so that's all for today and uh please like share and subscribe our Channel and hit a like button if you like this okay so thank you for watching and we will meet you in the next video thank you thank you so much so now today in this video what we are going to learn so basically we're going to learn about one of the more basic command that is CD command which means the change directory Okay C stands for change directory command so what we will do today uh we will learn about how we can change our directory from one to another okay now what I have to do I have to just increase the phont size for you guys are it should be visible uh I think yeah it's okay it's visible it should be and in the next video in window what I will do I will just open this file manager for your reference to show you how the things are working okay now this is our home directory here you can see home okay and right now we are also in the terminal we are on the home directory what we will do we will do this just LS okay so here you can see we are getting different files like different directory directress desktop downloads pictures snap videos documents and so on okay so now today in this video what we are going to learn about the CD command Okay CD what it basically means CD just stand for change directory what it will do it will just change your directory okay now our current direct is what it is our home okay we are at home we want to go on the desktop okay how we will do it so there are the two ways in which we can perform this action like first one is that we that is basically a concept of Linux so that's why I'm telling you uh that is of I think one of these is absolute path name and the second is relative path names okay so first we will talk about the absolute path name in absolute path names what we do we just provide the whole path okay uh wait a minute I'll just provide the desktop path okay I want to go move to into the desktop directory what I will do CD desktop this is basically what absolute path names okay so I will just hit enter and now you can see I'm in the desktop now what I will do I will do LS okay so here you can see the file which uh uh this is also One Directory uh in which we had created in the last video okay so this is the files of the desktop directory okay so this is the like uh one of the way in which we can do it like we call it as the absolute path names and now the next is relative path now what is this so basically relative path names works for a particular notation that is dot then or you can say double dot okay so what I I have to do now I have to go back now I'm in the desktop I have to go back okay like uh from let me cancel it like from here you can see I'm in the t uh right now we are here at the test okay in the desktop directory now what I have to go I have to go back in the where in the home directory so for this what I will do I will just do CD dot dot again back we are back okay we in this particular window or uh we this in this particular window you can say like in the home directory now there is also one more command uh which we learn in this video like that is PWD what it does it just shows you the present working directory so our present working directory is home/ why a because you a is one of the user of this particular OS that's why it's showing I like whenever you will create multiple users then you will get your own particular home directory in which you will create your separate files and folders or anything which you want to create okay that's why it's saying home I now what I will do I will move into the documents directory okay documents okay now now I'm here documents so now what I will do I will just do PWD so here you can see we are getting again the same present working that CD like home I use documents okay I hope you got the idea what how AWD is working how documents is working now what I have to do I have to just go back one more directory back one by dot dot okay we are back now I I will do PW again we are at the home and aush we add the home directory now we will just hit uh clear button and here what we will do we will create a one structure here you can see LS command is one of the folder and uh I will open up this folder and I will try to create again new folder that is test two okay now what we will do we have to come directly in the ls command folder so how we can do it first we first of all we will do LS okay we got the list of the all directory which are present in the home directory now where I have to go I have to go in the documents directory so I will do CD documents I'm just uh entering uh like after typing the DU and then if you will hit tab then automatically it will like app like this documents okay then after documents where we have to go like now I'm in documents now I will do LS we are on the this documents for directory and here is the directory that is LS command now what I have to do LS command okay now where we are we are in the document / LS command now what I will do I will do LS this is we are in the test two uh not in the test two like this is the content uh of this particular directory like LS command now I I will do I will again go back and go into the test two okay oh let me increase it width so it should be clear to you okay now what I will do I will just hit PWD PWD means present working di so my present working D is home I use documents LS command and the test two okay now what we will do we will go back one by one CD dot dot We Are One Directory back CD dot dot Again One Directory back CD dot dot Again One Directory back now we are where we are we are in the home directory now what I will do I will just uh give the whole path okay documents slash LS command slash test in this way you can also go in the like your final destination direct like providing the whole path in a single string okay now what I will do PWD so you can see the whole path like this is same as this this one like when we uh move went to that directly like one by one okay when we were doing one by one then we were all getting these results and also when we are doing like in a single string then also we are getting the same result I hope you got the idea about how this CD change direct working okay let me clear this now uh there is also one more shortcut to go directly in the home directory that is CD this till it will directly go into the home directory that is LS okay or we when we will do PWD you will get that particular window okay so I hope you got this uh how the things are working and this is all about the C CD like change directory command Okay CD stands for change directory okay I hope it is clear now so we will meet in the next video with uh like we will create some folders and files and all these things we will talk about in the next video so that's all for today's video and thank you for watching so we'll meet in next one okay thank you thank you for watching so mkdr command is nothing but uh like it just stands for the make directory okay what by directory means like in Linux we basically uh call directory but in the other uh operating system like Windows what we call it as a folder so directory is something basically like a folder you can uh like you can say like that okay direct is like a folder so now what I was talking about uh to create a directory so what we will do uh we will uh take uh like a uh structure to create a directory okay so let me draw uh structure for you this is a website where you can easily like uh draw any kind of structure or whatever you want okay I want to create a blank diagram create okay save it anywhere I don't care save oh sorry test okay here it is now what we will do uh we will create first uh University okay then uh in that University we will create students okay and uh then we will create facalities and then we will create uh you can call it as a workers okay and in the student section we will create uh like uh we will name it uh one of the student like aush okay or uh something like XY Z okay and similarly in the faculties uh you want to give it as some kind of uh instead of faculties here I will try to give it a subject okay now here we will write Linux networking okay and we will leave the workers as a blank okay so we will follow this pattern to create directives so this will be helpful too like when you will play with it you will get a better idea like and also you will get a practice about about the CD command that we have learned earlier in the last video okay so uh how will we proceed I will try to just uh off the screen I hope it should be visible to you okay yeah now it is visible and now what we will do we will clear the screen and we will do just LS okay so here what we have we have just desktop downloads pictures snap and these things okay and I will try to hit just PW PWD we are in where we are in the home directory now what I will do I will create a first University directory okay so I will create M KD i r and then I will write University okay I have created University let's say tells okay so here you can see uh we have got the university directory now what I have to do in the University I have to create this students directory subject and workers okay first what we will do we will create these directories one by one then after the after the whole this completion of the whole diagram sorry what we will do we will create these three directory like in a row okay in a single command we will do it okay so let's do it first single uh single okay so I will first go into the university directory CD and then we will do LS that is nothing what I will do I will create a student directory students okay then I will create uh when you get upper key then you will get the previous command okay then I will create subject then I will create workers okay so now I will do LS so here you can see we have got the three directories now what I have to do I have to create a uh more directories in uh students so here is one thing also I want to tell you about like here students in this students uh you will see the S is capital but when I will try to hit s with a small then what happen no such file direct why because this is a case sensitive in Linux it follows case sensitivity okay that's why it happens now what I will do c capital S then tap now t Okay students now where we are we are in the students directory when I will do PWD what we will get we'll get the exact location where we are okay so now what we have to do first of all I want to clear this whole thing okay now what I will do I will create two directors with name aush and with name uh angit okay LS AIT has been created okay now now what I will do I have to go back in the subject directory so how we can do it we will do just CD dot dot remember in the last video we talked about this CD dot dot and here now where I am I am in the University when I do LS I will have the access of subject and workers also what I will do now I will just do CD subject okay and then again bw2 we we are in the subject directory now what I have to do I have to create two directors Linux and then networking okay now I'll do LS here you can see Linux and networking has been created and in the workers directory we don't have to write anything or we don't have to create any kind of folder in it okay so this is the basically like simple process of creating files and directories in the Linux and now I will tell you some like uh um means I will do like uh creating these whole things in a single command okay not whole things but yeah this one and this one I will try to create okay so what I will do uh I will go in the home directory again clear now and I will show you here also like how in the file system it will look like whether it is there or not okay uh yeah here you can see University director is here in the University we have student subject workers and in the students we have aush and anit and back and in the subject we have Linux and networking and now what I will do I will just delete this directory okay uh from here I can delete okay to delete the directories and all I will tell you this in the next video okay otherwise everything will get mixed up okay so now if I will do LS here so there is no University folder is there now what I will do I will just create a university folder uh sorry University okay now university has been created I will move into this directory and now I have to do you know I have to create a student subject workers so what I can do mkd students okay space subject I think spelling mistake is there some okay yeah subject and then I will create workers boom no let's hit LS then you will get something yeah so here what we are doing in the same in the single command we are creating three directories or you can create multiple directory uh it all depends on you how much you want to create okay and now what I have to do in the students we have to create aush and XY Z so how I will do mkd in the students sorry sorry uh okay sorry for it uh I by mistake uh entered this enter okay this is LS okay now what I have to do I will go in the students directory students okay now what I will do I will create again the both aush and angit like before I okay LS same okay so this is like one way to create multiple directories at in a single command okay so I hope you got it how you can create multiple directories okay I'm not going to show you for the subject like it will be then you will get bored like I'm like displaying you same things again and again okay so now let me tell you something more interesting things okay I will clear and then go back into the home directory clear everything LS and now what I will do now I want to tell you some more Concepts like uh uh the options which we can use with the uh hyphen P command Okay so the first option which I want to show you like hyphen V that stands for veros so when we will do this mkd hyphen V it will tell you the uh like uh whether directory has been created or not okay so let's me let me create uh like um uh what anything Linux okay here you can see created directory Linux again uh let me tell you again I want to create same directory let's see what happens here you can see cannot create directly Linux file exist what if I remove hyphen B whether it stays displaying or not the same error okay it displays the same error okay so but when we use hyphen V it will tell you the status like whether direct is created or not okay I hope it's clear hyphen V and in the next we will talk about hyphen P op so what it does hyphen p uh like when we suppose we want to create a directory in which like University in the University students and then in the student we want aush okay aush we want only okay so how we can do it uh but before uh that I will need to sorry I will not delete that okay uh let it be I will get some more uh extra scenario like uh uh let's create uh some kind of uh like uh um sun and with sun let's create a ha father and then we will create obviously grandfather okay or we can Go reverse also I think I have created in the re reverse Mo should be in the last okay grandfather okay now what I will do mkd i r hyphen P option and Son slash father slash grandfather okay so basically this command what it will it will create the like in the sun directory you will get father in the father directory Direct you will get the grandfather but uh if you will not use hyphen P option then what will happen like we will not be able to create a directory like if son father does not exist then it will not create grandfather okay but if uh like if it exist son father exist okay sorry I got a little bit confused here let me first of all create this one okay LS a should should be sun directory son LS father LS okay so what I was trying to say like when we will use hypen P option if sonf father is not created then it will be get created automatically but when we will not use hyper Fe then it will not get created like uh let me go back and now what I will do I will try to create mkdr test one/ test 2/ test uh three it should be like in test one there should be test two in test two there should be test three here you can see cannot create directory okay no such file directory is there okay so I hope you got the like actual role of the hyphen P option okay and this is not a more uh big deal if you want to if you play more and more with this command you will get familiar with the this whole Linux environment okay that's not a big deal now the next thing is hyphen M option okay okay what it does this is nothing but mode okay mode or we can say permissions like uh uh till now we have not cover the permission section in Linux like it is another concept and another another video will come up on this concept like read write execute all these things but still I tell you like if the if the person will have the read read permission then that user can read the file if he has write then he can write the file or execute then he can execute that file but if he has all the three then he can do anything reite execute all okay so how we can do this mkdr hyphen M and we provide a equal to suppose we want to provide R WX all to the one directory that is test I hope test is not there yes test is created now what I have to do lsph L you can see he has the permission of all these things and here you can see where is test so rwx rwx rwx did that execute there is something like rwx for users and another this RW is for group and another this rwx is for other persons okay so when we will do test in this when we will go in this directory we can do any kind of operation mkd uh sorry mkd test blah blah blah okay we can do anything but now what I will do I will try to create uh One Directory with only operations okay so let's see what happens whether we are able to create or not anything in that particular d whether we have a permission or not so what I will do mkd hyphen m a equal to I want to give just read operation we can only read read and I will create test three let's dos hyph L and now you can see in test three we have on read permission to everyone users also groups also and others I think others have not any permission okay here okay now I will go in the test three test three you can see permission denied we don't have access to that folder so now who can access this folder there is also one user in the Linux bu root only root can access okay uh so that's all about this in this video like uh mkdr command so I hope you liked it and uh please like share subscribe uh our YouTube channel and now we will meet in the next video with another uh basic command like in the next video we will basically talk about the whole directory which we have created we will then again we will create some directory then we will delete it whether the direct is empty then what what we can do if it is not empty then how we can delete it so these are all the things which we will cover in the next video so that's all for today and we will meet in the next one thank you thank you so much for watching so now what I will do I will create uh one more directory I will start by creating a directory mkd aush okay I have created aush and now what I have to do uh I have to again create uh more Dory in aush CD aush okay mkd iush 2 okay iush 2 now we are done again I will go on the home directory and what I will do I will create one more directory mkd um test 67 okay so here you can see aush has been created already in the aush directory we have another iush 2 and text 67 where it is oh yeah here this is one okay so I will perform here LS and now you can see all the directory which we have created now what I have to tell you like to remove this directory uh the command is rmd I okay remove directory so there is a one thing in this like uh uh let me clear this all uh if directory is empty okay if like uh suppose this direct t 67 there is nothing this is empty directory so in this case we can easily use rmd okay we can easily use it but if directory is not empty suppose in this case I I to so in this case when we will do rmd so what will happen like it will uh like it will not delete that particular directory it will show you the error like uh directory is not empty okay but when you will go in the iuse directory and when you'll try to delete IUS 2 then it can be easily deleted why the reason behind is this like iuse to is empty okay I hope you got this point like uh how rmd command works so uh now our job is to just delete the directory and learn the things okay so let's start so what we will do uh LS now I will first try to delete the test 67 test 67 okay so now what will happen I will hit just enter and now boom so your test 67 has been deleted okay now again we will try to do LS here and so you will not see anywhere like T 67 is there now now what we will do and yeah one more S I want to tell you that uh for clearing the terminal if you do clear then it will clear obviously but there is also one more shortcut like Control Plus L automatically will get clear okay so now what we have to do we have to remove the directory iush okay now let's see what happens fail to remove iush directory not empty okay obviously D is not empty we know like there is another folder in aush so what we will do now we will go in aush directory and then I will try to first delete I 2 okay we have deleted and there is no any directory now what I will do I will go back in the home directory and I will delete iush okay so iuse has been deleted okay so suppose if there is many folders and directories like Suppose there in iuse there is I 2 to I 100 okay or in that particular directory there are other more directories okay so you have to delete this so this is very tedious work like uh like it's not easy to do one by one okay so so like the solution for that is that like we will use some flax with it okay so now again let me create a directly I will use hyphen P option if you watched previous video then you will get it what is hyphen p and all these things so I'm going to create a not test let's create with I one I 2 I 3 uh so what what will happen here like in I one there will be I2 in I two there will be I three so you can check here uh is one I2 and I3 and in I2 there will be nothing it will be empty directory so now what I have to do I have to delete this whole directory in single command so what I will do there are multiple ways I will tell you everything each one by one the more uh different ways okay so we will use rmd slash S okay and then we will just provide the directory name I one okay so uh what this command will do basically it will delete the whole the directory from the root to the end like child like it will start from I and it will end to the I 3 and it will delete the whole file structure and with this command it will ask you for the permission like you you will need to enter yes or no whether you want to delete or not like just like a confirmation message it will ask for you let's check what happens okay uh it's showing no such fileo directory why uh one minute let me check with this hyph help whether it works in ubu or not okay sorry we can use hyphen P option for that okay sorry what we'll do rmd hyphen p i one I think we will need to provide whole path okay I three so we can easy have we have deleted easily in this way also we can use rmd in this way okay but there is also one way that SL say I will need to just check with the Google uh why this command didn't work uh not working with the one2 like I have used this command earlier it was working in my Linux machine uh let me check with it um and also let's go with the rmd SL s okay Google is your friend bu like if you will stuck somewhere then this is your only friend where you will get the help okay okay so here is the like documentation of Microsoft then if it is Microsoft then like it should be correct here sles what it's saying delet a directory tree this specif direct and all subir including all files okay we work correct and this rmd SLS test to remove directly name test and all okay we were doing the same thing I didn't get why it's not working in a uh like there may be some reason uh here you can see like there is uh there may be okay uh leave it uh I will try one once more let's check it happens or not I try to create again the same directory I will just hit the what was the command rmd sles and uh I one is there okay okay okay okay okay fail to remove okay if I do forcefully then what happens okay it's not working even so now what is the options to delete the whole directory in single command like uh sles failed in I don't know why we will figure it out later uh but now what is the other way so there is a way so what we will do we can use the RM command okay with the help of this command we can easily delete all the files like in a single command what we will use the flag with it RM hyph RF okay and then a one done we are done buddy like RF stands for recursively and F stands for forcefully we can easily use this RM command to remove these directories in a one single command Okay so uh that's all for um today I hope you got it like uh how we can delete the directories uh in this uh by using a particular single command or by one by one command like basically uh in the like uh real world we basically use this RMI an RF okay we use it uh because uh like uh whenever we create a direct it will not be mty like you can get it you can relate it with it like whenever you create then you create it for some kind of purpose that's why so we can easily use this RM RF command for this uh removing directory okay so that's all for today uh I hope you liked it uh I hope and uh if you have any query then please you can ask us in comment section and yeah please do like share and subscribe our Channel and yeah thank you thank you for watching this video how we can create files in Linux using touch command okay so here and here in both sides there is files here is files okay and I will move into to that particular directory files okay and now what I will do I will create some files using touch command okay so I will do Touch file 1.txt okay so basically what this command will do it will just like delete the uh sorry I'm saying delete it will just create file one.txt okay but that file will be empty for you like there will you cannot write anything at that time you will need to first open that file then you will need to write in that it okay but there are also some ways where we can perform both thing like uh simultaneously we can like create files and we can write something uh in that also but this we will see in the next video okay so first we will uh talk about this touch command so when will hit enter and I will do LS and here you will see like file 1.txt will be created okay so I hope it is clear to you and now what if I want to create multiple files okay then I can easily do with file 2.txt file 3.txt file 4. txt and I will just hit enter uh sorry LS and here you can see all these and four files have been created okay so this is the one way to create files okay and now with the touch command like we can use various options with it like hyphen a hyphen M hyphen R also we can use it so I will start with the first one that is hyphen a option basically what this option does like it will change the access time of your file suppose uh now we have created this file let me do LS hyphen l okay so file one has been created at uh this one 1242 a.m. okay and this is 43 and all these things so basically this is the modification time okay if you want to look at the access time you will need to hit LS hyph luu okay uh access time 42 okay The Hyphen L option will show you the modification time hyphen Lu option will show you the access time when the file is accessed okay so what I'm going to do I will try to access this file and now 1244 it is okay so I have access this file okay and will write something High okay and I will just uh close it and again I will do this I will need to find the excess time so here you can see the 1244 is now the access time of file 1.txt okay and I have not visited file 2.txt yet okay so it's access time it is still showing 1243 so now what I have to do I will change the access time using the hyphen a option so how we can do it touch hyphen a and then file name so I want to change the access time for file name uh which one uh let's do for file 1 txt okay so it will change my access time from 1244 to the my current time so my current time is what 1245 okay and now I will do LS IU and here you can see file 1.txt okay now what I will do like here we have not uh like uh visited this file 2.txt okay even when you don't open on that file we don't write anything in that but file still you can change the access time for it okay Suppose there is someone in your like work environment like uh you want to change the access time uh just for your any kind of purpose okay so what I'm going to do uh touch hyph I will just uh change the file name from file 1 to two Okay and now I will do LS hyphen Lu and here you can see the access time for File 2 has been like change now okay it's 1246 okay and now uh I will just clear it all now again I will check the access time so access time is for first one 1245 1246 and for let's check for modification time that is at the modification this is sh 1244 okay and 1243 1243 all the why 1244 because uh we we have write high in this file 1.x that's why it's going 1244 okay now what if you want to change the modification time instead of uh this access time so what I will do now I will just hit uh uh like work with the hyphen M option okay hyphen M and I will change for file 3.txt and now let's do just LS hyph L file 3 you can do like this also and now it's swing 1247 as here it was 1243 now the it is modified to the 1247 and here you can see the access time is 1243 so now let's check also the access time for file 3.txt whether it is change or not it will not change because we have not done anything with it so it will be as it is like it is 1243 okay so I hope you got it how it is working the how we can basically change the access time modification time with the touch command okay we are creating files also and we can also manipulate the access time and the modification I'm using this command okay so now uh moving uh forward uh the there is also one option hyphen R okay so basically this option what it will do it will just uh uh like uh what we can say like copy the access time of first file to the second file okay so now what I will need to do I will show you both the uh access time I will show you for file 1. XT and what I will do touch hyph R file one and file 2.txt okay and and again I will do the ls hyph Lu so here you can see the access time for file 2.txt has been change from 1246 to 1245 and now let's check for the modification time for file 1 and file 2 so modification time for file one and file two is same okay I hope you got it how it is working in the excess time and notification time I hope you got the like how hyphen a hyphen M and and iPhone R option works together okay so that's all for this video and in the next video we will basically talk about uh how we can write some kind of like whatever you have to write in the file while creating a file okay so that's it for today and we will meet in the next one so thank you thank you for watching and please do like share and subscribe our Channel and if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section okay thank you thank you for watching and now in this video we will talk talk about uh how we can create files using cat command and also we will see some other operations using cat command Okay so uh let me increase the size of the terminal I think now it's fine and I will just open up my file system in my left hand sign to be more clear with you guys okay so now what we will need to do uh we will we will have to learn about uh cat command okay so basically cat command uh we can use to create files and also we can use use this cat command to like concatenate some more files together or you can say like merging more than one file in a one single file okay you can also do it in this and also uh we can use it like uh like to get the how many uh numbers like to show the lines and all those things in this in the particular files okay so now we will start with the creating file okay so let me do first LS so I think I have some files directory let me check what is there okay file on file 4 okay I know what is uh let's create some files with cat command Okay so cat I will go with the test 1.txt and what here the main benefit is that we can simultaneously write whatever we want to write in that particular test file so here I'm just writing this is test one file okay in txt format and what you have to do you have to just hit enter and then control T okay so in this way we can create files okay and uh now what we have to do we have to do LS and here you will see test one.txt has been created for you and here also you can see it okay now now the other feature of cat command is that like uh you can also read the contents of that text file so how you can do it you can just C and then the whatever the file name is there you can provide it okay that test one. XT I will hit enter and here you will see the whatever is the content of the file um like it is being printed here okay so uh this is the like two operations we covered and now what we will need to do uh I will create one more file okay uh cat test to. XT okay and here I will write this is test two file in txt format okay just hit enter and then contr D and now what we will do we will see the content of test2.txt and here you can see this is test2 file in txt format okay now what we will I need to do what I will do I will try to like concatenate like uh what you can say test test two conent in test one okay so how I can do it cat test one.txt then again this redirection operator this is called redirection operator and test 2.txt hit enter I will try to see the content of first uh test one let's see what is there okay so basically this command like will pend in test to.tx not in t sorry for that okay test two and here you can see like the whatever the content of test one file has been included in this particular test two file okay from here you can see also like when I will just hit double click on it and here you can see the same thing here also okay so this is the one way of like appending uh two files together okay and what we can do uh if you want like append content of those file in another some file like suppose like test three file so what we will do we will there just simple uh cat uh test1.txt test2.txt and then I thing just uh redirection operator and here we will write test 3.txt and now what we will do we will see here like test three has been created also when we will do LS head you can see test three has been created now what we will do I will try to read the content of test 3 test 3.txt okay oh so here you can see the content of both the files like this is showing test one two times because in test two uh it was there like this was the content of test two file okay so in this way we can uh like merge multiple files as many you want okay and uh now moving forward like uh now we will learn about some like uh what we can say little bit uh options which we can use with this cat command so first of I will uh I want to show you is cat hyphen n test 3.txt so this command basically what it does it uh uh basically like show you the lines with number wise okay here you can see this is first line This is second line This is third line and similarly here also you can see the uh like uh all those things like 1 2 3 okay so this is the one way uh to like get the files by number wise and if you want to uh check the like end where is the ending of that all the line then at that time it will show you the dollar character at the end end of the line okay here you can see like here the line is ending that's why it is Swing dollar here what if we will do uh here I will change little bit uh like here I will change like uh this is uh another file and I will just hit control s and full stop also and let me cut this and here you can see the line is ending here okay so I hope you got it why swing dollar dollar is because like here at this point of uh line uh sentence or at this point of word thus line has been ended so that's why here it is Swing dollar okay so this is the basic use of hyphen e command okay now uh what if you want to add like uh uh some more content in uh like previous file previous file means like it is already created you don't have to create anything for it so for that you don't have to do anything uh you have to just uh apply double redirection that is this one get and suppose I want to write in test one.txt okay and here first we will see the content of this so here you can see this is test on file in text format and I have to write uh something like this is uh tutorial based on Linux uh CTS or something like that okay and just hit control D okay and I will just uh like uh reopen this particular file um okay so here you can see like uh this isial based on has been like added in this particular test one.txt file okay and uh uh there is also one like uh option which we can see like uh hyphen T option okay so basically what it does uh it will show you the tab like where where is the tab in the particular line okay so what I will do now I will just uh like uh give a tab here okay one tab two tab three tab I'm giving here okay and justrl S and the tab will be represented by this this symbol I think let's see what it shows cat file one dot uh sorry what is the file name okay test one do txt test one. txt okay so uh this is the content which we so now what I will do I will just have to use the Hy option and here you can see uh this is uh the particular symbol and I I I it's showing like three tabs is there it is showing that's it okay so uh uh that's all about uh like uh this scat command okay I hope you liked it and if you have any issue or if you are facing any problem any kind of confusion then you can ask us in comment section and yeah please do like share and subscribe our Channel okay thank you thank you for watching we'll meet in the next video and now in this video we will talk about um RM command Okay so RM basically stands for remove okay so in this basically like uh video we will uh we're going to talk about how we can remove files okay and also like basically this uh the itm command basically we use it for removing files but also we can use it for removing directories also okay so today we will see and learn all about this so now what we have to do I will just create some files okay uh let me do a l okay so here is no any files I have deleted all okay start with touch 1. dxt 2. dxt 3. dxt and 4. dxt okay I hope you are aware of this touch command as we have already covered okay now LS so here will you can see like all the four files have been created okay now what I have to do uh I will tell you about the RM command okay so basically uh RM them command is used to remove the directories how we can uh sorry not directories files also okay not only directories okay so what we will do uh we will try to remove the 1.txt okay so how I can do it RM and then the file name 1.txt enter now what I will do I will just hit LS and here you can see 1.txt is not here okay it is deleted now again let's start with 2.txt it is also related now let's uh Delete 3.txt and again 4. txt okay now let's hit enter and LS and here you will see uh all the files which we have created has been deleted okay so uh like this is how TDS work like when you you will remove one by one one by one so if you want to remove many files like at one time okay so how you can do it so again I will need to just create all those uh text so I have created the four 4 text files now what I have to do I will just uh rm1 then two then three then four I will just hit enter and LS all file is gone okay nothing is there so all file has been deleted now so now uh let me tell you about the some of the options which you can use with this RM command like hyphen f hyphen I also capital I all these things I will tell you okay so again let me create those those files okay now files has been created here now I will show you RM Hyun I option small small I uh what it will like do what so basically it just prompts you for the like confirmation uh like whether you want to delete this file or Not by sometime what happens you by mistake uh like delete some of the files you don't get any prompt and all so with this option you will get prompt okay so I will just hit enter and here you will see remove regular mty file you have to do yes or no if I will do yes it will get deleted I will just hit in uh LS and then see one TT has been deleted what if I do n uh let's do for 2. XT n so obviously this file will not be deleted so 2. dxt is as it is okay so this is about hyphone I like a small I with which you will get uh prompt about about whether you want to delete or not some files okay but you will think about in this case you we were deleting like all these four text files uh like uh in a one single command okay but we uh so how we can get uh prom for this so there is also option for it okay so uh let me first remove all these files 3.txt 4. txt okay LS that is no files and again I will just try to create those four files okay now uh there is also one option like hyphen capital I okay what it does when you will go to remove more than three files it will ask you for the confirmation whether you want to delete all those files at once okay or not but it will ask only once okay so how we can do it touch not touch sorry 1 txt 2.txt 3.txt 4. txt here you can see we have how many files four files I will hit enter and again here you will see remove do you want to remove four arguments if you will do yes why then obviously it will be deleted now we will do LS so here you will see there is no any files okay all files has been deleted okay there is also uh more options like uh hyphen V okay what it does sorry if I will go with hyphen V option uh we can like combinely use more than two options together so hyphen V what it does it will show you what is being done okay so let's hit enter I will say yes and here you will see what happened remove 1.txt then 2. XT then three then four okay sorry so these are the four files which have been deleted and you have got the information like what was going on after like hitting this particular command okay so hyph we only just display the what is going on okay and now let's move towards like uh directories okay how we can delete uh empty directories or uh like nonempty Direct so let me create One Directory hyphen p uh I will choose with the uh A1 A2 A3 okay so uh like uh are you uh you will get like in A1 directory there will be A2 in A2 there will be A3 directory okay so I will do LS and uh if you want to go in the A1 directory so when you will to LS said you will get the A2 directory okay so in similar way in A2 there is A3 now I go in the home directory I will clear the screen now I want to remove this particular directory to remove directories which is non empty like in A1 there is something okay so for this we basically use the r option with r we can use f f option for forcefully deleting okay but we are not using here it okay so I will just go with the A1 and I will just hit enter and all the directories will get deleted okay if I do LS so that you will see there is no A1 now what I will do I will just create again those directories and uh I will run with the iPhone V option okay and here we'll see remove directory first A3 then A2 then A1 okay uh if you want to use hyphone I option then also you can use a small I it will ask you yes then it will ask you for the next you yes then next you have to do yes so remove directory A1 A2 A2 then again y then again for the final one so in this way uh like uh we can use the RM command with the hyph V iir and these are all options okay now if you want to delete uh like um uh empty directory okay so this is a empty directory there is nothing in s0 you can also do with r option but uh there is also one more like uh uh what you can say flag or option is D we Bic deletes the empty directories we lo as 0 0 and it will delete the okay so test 0 has been deleted now uh again I will show you with the hyphen V option so you can get the like confirmation or there should be no any confusion regarding things okay so hyph V and yeah remove director t 0 okay so uh that's all for today and I hope you liked it about this uh like how we can remove files and directories with the RM command as this is a basic Linux command okay and now today in this video we are going to talk about one of the more basic command that is a CP command Okay so CP stands for just uh like copy okay what we will do like basically we will copy files and directories from One Directory to another or from one file to another just like in Windows we do right click and click on copy and all so same thing uh like will happen here but using command line okay or you can say using CP command Okay so let's start the tutorial uh first of all open up the terminal and let me increase the font size for you okay now it's okay and open this files uh like for your reference okay okay so here it is now what I will do LS so here are some files okay uh let me create uh One Directory copy command okay I will move into this particular directory and here also I will move in that directory okay so here you can see uh there is no any files or directories here what I want to create I want to create uh files uh let's create one.txt I will write this as 1.txt file contr D okay here you can see 1. XT file has been created now what if you want to create uh the copy of this particular text file okay so how you can do it so to perform this action we have a basic command that is CP command okay it stands for copy so what we will do in a basic simple way we will just give the file name 1. XT and where you want to create that particular copy I want to create in the same directory so I will just give the name of that file in which I want to uh like copy that file so here you will see 2. XT is not there okay so what will happen in this case like if the file exists so it will overwrite simply overwrite the whatever you have written but if file doesn't exist so it will create and then after that it will copy the content of 1. text into 2. text okay so let me do LS and I will try to read 2. 2.txt so here you can see the content of this particular like uh particular 1.txt file okay so this is the like one of the simple way in which we can copy files and files okay so now uh what I want I want to copy this uh 1. TT file into some other locations so how we can do it so uh like right now where you are let's check you are in the this home iush copy command okay I will try to split the terminal so that will be uh helpful let me uh like create one more terminal control shift plus I hope it is visible to you let me just reduce some size okay so now what I will do I will do LS here okay now uh let's do PWD okay and uh you are in the home aush right now I will just copy this like uh path now what I want I want to copy this CP 1.txt file at oh sorry 1.txt file let me paste home iush okay and here I will create 2.txt so here you can see there is no any 2.txt kind of file let's hit enter and here you will see uh let's to LS and here will you will see true. txt has been created let me open the like check the content of that particular file so here it is this is 1.txt file okay uh like uh it was a like a little bit uh like difficult because you will need to give the whole path uh where you want uh to copy that particular file okay so in this way you can copy uh this uh like files in any you want you will just need to give the like whole path okay where you want to copy that particular file now one more thing I want to tell you guys let me clear the screen here also I will do LS here okay now what I want I uh like want to copy that file okay but what if uh 2.txt file already exist okay so what will happen so now what I will do uh uh I will add some more text in 1.txt some more text has been added in this file okay contr D now uh let's check the content of the 1.txt so here you can see this uh 1.txt contain and let's check the container 2.txt it should be uh like as a similar one 1. TT okay now what we will need to do I will also need to copy this uh 1. txt into 2.txt okay so I will just try to uh hit the like previous command but here what I will use I will just hit the hyphen I option okay why hyph I option it will just prompt you for file over written thing like if file already exist so it will prompt like whether you want to overwrite the content of one.txt or not like because there is something else in the two.txt if you will like without hyph I you will run this command so it will simply overwrite the content of 1.txt into 2.txt but using hyph I what it will do it will just prompt you for your decision whether you want to override or not okay so let's hit enter and here you can see it is asking for overwrite and question mark uh whether yes or no I will just hit yes now I will try to check the content of this 2.txt file so here you can see like it has been copied okay I hope you got it how you can do it also now what if I want to copy like uh file one and file file to into some other directory okay so uh let me uh like uh check LS so here you can see 1.txt and 2.txt file is there now what I want I want 1.txt 2.txt into some another directory uh same here in is the same case if directory exist then it will like um uh like copy this files if directory doesn't exist then it will create a directory and then after it will copy that like these files into that particular directory okay so how you can do it uh copy 1. now directory name so uh uh what you can write copied files okay uh let me hit enter okay is not a directory I think I will need to use hyphone R option maybe okay uh let me create a directory copied files and now let me try to copy these uh files into it okay okay sorry uh check Lis I will move into this directory and I will LS okay okay now now these files has been ComEd so in this case like uh it is not uh uh creating directory if uh that directory doesn't exist okay so uh like like in this way you can like copy uh like more than one files or into some another directory okay now uh one more option is there like if you want to copy uh like One Directory to some another directory you want to make a copy of directories okay so how you can do it I will move into the home directory uh let me clear the screen and then LS okay so what I want do I want this copy command the copy of this copy command directory so I will use CP hyph R for recursive so it is Ed for the directory copies okay so how you can do it you will give the first uh the this uh directory name and another directory in which you want so I will use copy command V2 and hit enter and H to LS and here you will see copy command V2 has been created now let's move into this particular directory and LS so here you can see like director has been like copied okay so in this way uh you can uh play with the copy command and all okay so that's all for today's video now in this video we will talk about uh like one of the basic command that is MV command it like it basically stands for move so basically in this video we will talk about how we can move files from one location to another or also you can say like how we can move directory from one location to another location okay so today in this video we're going to learn about this like how we can move files from one location to another so first of all let me open up the terminal and now let me just increase the font size for you guys so it should be visible to you and I will just open up this files for your reference so whatever we will perform here it will be visible to you guys okay okay so now what I will do first of all I will create One Directory mkd move move command okay and uh now what we will need to do let me clear I will move into that particular directory and I will create one file Touch file 1.txt we will create okay and here is Touch file 1.txt okay uh also let me no wait a minute I will try to create a file with cat command because I have to write something in it this is file one control D okay now it is save now uh what we will do I have to move this file one.txt okay file 1.txt from this move move command directory to some another directory that is I have to move this onto suppose desktop okay so now what I will do uh first of all I will open up one more terminal and uh I will move into the CD desktop okay I will do PWD I will check the like path of that particular desktop where it is so here you can see home home I use desktop okay so now what we will do I will use here MV like stands for move I have to move file 1.txt to home iush desktop and here what you can do like like this command is also useful like changing the name like we can also name files okay but here I'm going to use only file.txt okay and I will hit enter and uh on the desktop I will do here LS so here you will see file.txt has been like created okay or uh you can see here also on the desktop uh I think it is here here you can see the file do text has been created okay so uh this is the basics of how we can move files from one location to another now like this command is also useful in renaming files okay so if I will to LS so there is nothing because we have already moved it uh let's create another file cat file 2.txt this is File 2 okay and this and now what I want I want to rename this file file two I want to make it file three so we can do it MV File 2 s here I will do just file 3.txt and I will do LS and here you will see the name of the file two has been changed to file three now let's check the content of file 3 whether it is same or not so cat file three so it is this is file two okay so in this way you can also rename the like file names okay I hope you got it uh now let me tell you one more another thing like uh if suppose uh here is file.txt okay on the desktop and uh you want to move that uh file one which is here to move into this particular directory or particular location so if already file 1 txt like uh exist here so what will happen when we will like uh try to move files from this location to this location with the same then it will override so to overcome overcome this issue what we will use we will use hyphen I command not command hyphen I flag we will use okay first what I will do I will uh change the file name to file one not file one file. text I will change LS okay now what I will do MV file. txt then home iuse desktop and again file Dot txt and here I will use hyphen I option and here you can see override do you want to override this particular file which it exist it is asking so I can say yes or no but before uh let's check the content of this file this is file 188 is showing now I will do yes and uh hit enter and now I will again check the content of this file so here you can see this is file two okay I hope it is visible to you yeah this is this file two is the now the like uh decent content of this file because it is overwritten okay now next uh what are we I have to do I will try to move uh like uh some files into one particular directory okay so what I will do I will create uh two files 1.txt 2.txt now let's create here TT also okay now you can see LS so these are the th which we have created now I will um make a directory here on the desktop mkd uh move files okay now what I will do MV 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt into the directory home iuse desktop on on nextt to what we have move files we'll hit enter and we'll do LS so here we can see there is no any files here now I will move into the move files and I will do LS so here you can see all the files has been like moved at this particular locations okay so uh this is the another way to like moving files from one location to another like from uh one location to any kind of directory in which you want okay now moving uh forward uh what we can do uh like how you can copy like One Directory to another location okay or renaming it okay so let me go back here and now at desktop here you can see move files and one directory that is test directory okay now what I want I want to First rename this this file or this directory so move files I will try to rename it m files now so here you can see the like move files has been changed to m files now what now I want to move this m files into this tester directory uh so what I can do MV m files and then the test enter LS there's no m files here now CD changeed to test now let's do LS and here you can see m files has been moved at this particular location or you can say add the test directory okay so in this way uh like you can move files from one location to another or from One Directory to another or how you can also re name files and also so in this video you learn about it so today we will stop here and we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and please if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section okay hello guys and welcome back to the channel this is aush and now in this video here is the test for you guys till the topics which we have covered till now I think till MV command we have covered so in this uh test we have approx 15 questions which will be given by you and after that you will get the uh each like one point for every correct answer and you will get the link of this form in the description of this video okay so best of luck for it and I hope you will do great and we will meet in the next video okay byebye now in this video we will cover the zip command okay so basically uh as you are aware of zip like weip files to compress the size of that particular directory particular file which we use okay suppose you want to transfer a file of 500 MB to your friend okay but uh uh you want to compress that file and after that you want to send it to that your friend so when you zip that file so the size will be automatically decreased okay so that's why we use a zip command so basically in the Linux we will use the zip command okay for zipping the files and directories okay but in U windows uh you use uh that particular GOI to zip the files okay so now in this video what we are going to do we will first of all create a One Directory MK zip and let's move into this directory it also maybe zip has been created yes here it is now what we will do I'll create multiple files uh 1. txt 2.txt 3 do txt okay so basically on in a simple way how you can zip file without any option so this is a just simple like you zip and the file name which you want to give to that particular uh ZIP file so I I'm giving it the file.zip and the particular files which you want to which you want to add in that particular zip file okay so now what we can do uh I will just hit enter and here you can see file zip has been created now in this particular uh ZIP file you can see 1. TT has been added okay so but what if uh you want to add multiple files okay if you want to add multi multiple files in your uh that particular this ZIP so how you can do it so for this what you will do I'm I'm going to create another Z file Z File 2. 1.txt 2 do txt 3.txt and again here you can see file to.ip in this we will get actually three files okay 1 2 3. T we are getting here so this is the way of zipping multiple files together okay in uh particular uh ZIP file in which you want so now what we are going to do I'm again going to create some more files touch 4. text 5. text 6. txt okay so now what I want to do I'm going to zip uh 4. txt and file 3.zip file okay so the option is one of the option of the zip command is hyphen you option which we can use to like uh uh add some other files in that particular zip file uh it means like uh in the file 3.zip right now we have have only 4. txt okay so what I'm going to do I will add five and six also without tampering four so the there is a hyphen you option in the zip command okay which we can use to perform that particular action so I'm going to add here 5. txt and also 6. txt and now I will open up this uh ZIP file and here you can see 456 has been added okay so we will cover unzip in next video uh that's why I'm going I'm showing you like this okay that's why I'm not unzipping it with the CMD okay so in this way you can add uh other files also and one more option is there like uh hyon M option so what it does it's basically like it will zip the file and it will also delete that particular file sometimes in case uh you don't want to uh like um what we can say keep that particular particular file okay in your desk or to save your space or something like that you can think of it so how we can do it uh like here is Ls I'm going to do and here is 6. till1 to 6. txt is file now what I'm going to do zip hyph M I will use file 4. and I will add suppose 4. txt 5. 6. txt hit enter adding all those things and here you can see all the four to six. txt file has been deleted and here in the file for. J we will get the 4 56. txt files so using hyph you can uh like uh ZIP that all files and also uh you can delete that files to save your space H you will not need to delete that file after the zipping of all that things okay so now moving forward what we can do so uh suppose if you have have other directories also like uh with txt files you have some other directories so how you can do it how you can zip that also so you can do that in a recursive manner uh like using iPhone R option so first of all what I'm going to do I will just create some other director like let's create test okay I have created test directory and you have to like uh what you can say you have to add one to 3. txt files also and also test uh directory in one G file how you can do it you have to just use hyphen R option so hyphen R option what it does it basically work as a recursive manner like it will uh ZIP your directory and also file switch you you will use so let's uh give it a name as di do zip and then what we can do 1. txt 2.txt 3. txt and the name of the file not file directory enter and uh where it is D.Z and here you can see all of your files has been added into that particular zip file okay so in this way you can uh add some other like more than files and directories in one zip file using a single command using hyph option mostly it happens mostly we use it in like uh in our Windows system like we have multiple files in One Directory also some other directory so you can basically like use it in this case and one more important thing and the last one the last option which we will see together is hyphen e option okay it basically stands for encrypt so what it does uh let me like what I will do I will add this 1.txt file into one zip file with a password okay basically it will create a zip file with an password so how you can do it zip I will write password do zip into 1. text like 1. TT I want to zip into this particular file password do zip I will use hyphen e option and here it will ask for me to enter the password which you want I will use something okay aush and here you can see adding one.txt stored in that particular zip file so where it is uh this one password. okay let me open it uh yeah and now here 1. TT like has you can see here log type also like uh it will me like prompt me to enter the password now I will enter and here you can see 1.txt has been unlocked as there is nothing so it's showing like nothing here okay we have not written anything in that 1tt file okay so uh that's all for today uh I hope you got it how you can zip files uh and also how you can zip multiple files together in a single file with the hyphen e option like if you want to like protect uh or jip some sensitive files and you have to send it to some other person you don't want to disclose that particular file so you can easy use Hy option also in that case so that's all for and now in this video we will start with the most uh basic command that is unip command Okay so uh first how we will start uh I will create a one directory that is uh sorry mkd zip and I will move into that particular directory and I will create some files 1. TT t uh sorry 2.txt 3.txt okay now these three files has been created now what I like to do I want to zip all these three files in uh one particular zip file okay so 1. 2xt 2.txt 3. T3 and I want to zip all these in a single file that is files.zip okay all has been added I will do LS here you can see files.zip and for your reference I will open up this directory and here you can see all these files and Z files are there in the in this directory so now in this particular we are going to study about uh unip how you can unip these particular files and particular zip files okay so the most basic and um simple uh like uh command that is unzip we used to like extract files of this particular zip file so how we can do it we will just use unzip and the particular file name sorry and here you can see it is asking me for do you want to replace or not okay so I will just hit control C right now okay uh because I don't want to create any confusion for you guys first what I will do I will just create all uh remove all this 1 do txt 2.txt and 3.txt files I have now deleted all these files now what now I will use unzip and the files.zip and it will simply like extract all the files which are present in this files.zip for your reference let me open it so you can see what are the files is present so here you can see these are the three files which are present in this particular zip file so I will hit this command and done we have simply extracted all the files of that particular files. Z file okay so this is a very simple way to extract files and now moving forward uh suppose like uh you want your these files and these 1.2.3 do text in some kind of another locations uh suppose in many cases you want to store these files in some other directories okay so uh how you can do it uh without like um extracting all these files in the same directory in which your files. jip so but you can extract this file in some other directories also so how you can do it this is very simple now what I will do uh I will open up a new terminal or okay let me open up a new terminal uh let me increase a little bit of font size for you and uh I will create uh one folder that extracted files okay I move into this folder and I will copy the whole path that is home iuse extracted files okay in uh uh this uh terminal you can copy by control shift C okay I will just move it here now what if you want to like unzip files in some particular directory so for this we use basically hyphen option okay in this we will provide the path of that particular particular directory where you want to store that particular uh extracted files so unzip and then the file name which you want that is files. Chip and hyund d and then control shift V and here we want our files in this extracted files directory okay now what we will do here I will do just list in this particular terminal and here you can see all of these files has been like uh extracted in this particular directory so in this way also like you can uh store your uh instructor file in some kind of another directory okay so this is another simple trick uh like uh which uh uh you should know about it and also there are many options like uh suppose in case what happens you have extracted your files uh uh Z file already but uh sometimes also what happens uh you accidentally click on it so in this case in Linux what happens when you try to like unj files and uh in the same directory or you can say in another so here you can see we have already these files 1 2 3.txt what what what will happen when I will try to hit the same command again so it will ask me for do you want to overwrite these files or none or nothing or else okay I said uh I will say yes okay and again it it is asking for 1. 2xt again I will say yes again for two. text and 3. text okay yes so again these all the files has been replaced okay in case if I would made any changes in this well then I will definitely choose no because I don't want to create any kind of problem for myself okay so uh like this is the basic uh options which we can use to unj files and also uh like you should know about one more option that is uh hyphen Q option what is it okay uh I Will Show You by uh first what I will do I will remove the all these one do and all these files from this directory okay so here you can see there's all the files what basically in simple case what happens when I do it will show me me these messages okay extracting these files extracting 2.txt extracting 3.txt uh in some cases we we don't want this kind of information because we know it will simply extract the files so for this what we can use we can use just uh hyphen Q option iph q and then file Store zip it will uh just avoid like it will not print any kind kind of extra things so uh for before hitting this command I will try to again remove all those files and now I will use hyphen qy option and done so in this case we didn't get any kind of information or any kind of message like whether this file has been extracted or not okay now again let me remove it and I will again tell you one more option that is hyphen L option basically if you are aware of Ls command so you will definitely know about higher LS High funel option which basically like list all the uh means list the files in a long format okay you can say like we get many kind of things like date time user guest not guest uh groups user groups access time modify time we get all those kind of information and simply uh you can say permissions also like we will have a separate lecture on permissions okay so now what we can do unip hyph L and again I will try to unip these files uh it is looking so much like U so much stuff there let me clear first in screen now again I will write HL and then file St zip and here you can see the more extra information about the extracted files you can see the length the length is zero and uh date time name all these things all these things okay so it basically doesn't extract but it simply shows you the whatever the files are present in the particular uh zip files okay so that's it for today now in this video we are going to cover the most important topic of the Linux series that is the permissions okay so uh in this video we will cover the concept which lies inside this particular topic and uh commands we will cover in the next video okay so basically uh let me tell you about the permissions I hope you may be aware of it uh but uh still let me tell you like um I will tell you with one of the example with the real life example uh suppose you have a PC and you are the administrator of that particular PC and you have some other users like your brother or you can or your sister okay and you have some kind of files okay which you don't want to show those files to that particular user particular your brother okay so in this case what you will do you will specify a particular permission to that file so that file should not visible or should not accessible to other user so in this way we can set permit missions to the files or directories or whatever you want so that should not be accessible to other users or other person okay or you want your profiles to like keep it secret or keep it private you can say so uh I will tell you with uh a diagram also so that uh it will be easy to understand for you guys so here you can see you uh here is the administrator that you okay and uh suppose uh here is your brother uh your brother okay or sister you can say and also you have some files also that is I will name it as a private files okay and uh this one and from this to this you have uh like uh you will have the access and your brother will not have the access for it not access okay so in this way you can understand like this is the private file okay you have the administrator you have the access for it but your brother or sister uh if they want to access this particular file they will get get the error like permission denied or something like that okay so in this way permission like uh you can get the scenario of the how permission work okay uh so now uh in our Linux operating system or you can saytu uh sorry I will show you the permissions okay so I hope you are aware of Lis command so this command basically doesn't so much information about uh the what are the the permission what is the size who is the user who is the group all these things it doesn't so but when we'll do LS iel then it basically like uh what we can say long listing description of the files and directories okay wait a minute so in this way here you can see there are multiple columns like you will think first like what are these things I'm not getting anything but here you can see like this is First Column is just for permissions next column is for this is the hard links which we will cover in other videos okay and this is the user who is the user who have access of that particular directory and who are the groups and this is the file size date modification date and time these things are there and this is obviously the directory name so right now in this video we don't have to focus on all these other columns like user group we will have a separate video when and at the time user creation all these things but now in this video we have to only focus on these particular things like only on the first colum what is the d r WXR WXR what are these things so we will cover now in this video okay so I hope you got it now what I will do increase the font size first let it be 18 not 18 uh 24 yeah uh wait a minute yes first uh uh I will write the rwx okay again similar thing is we have to do R WX and R WX I will tell you one by one what is these things so basically R what is r r stands for read and uh we have W stands for right okay and uh x x stands for XC cute okay so these are the some like uh notations rwx is for the permission in our Linux operating system that is R stands for read it just means suppose you have a file and you want to give that file only the read access to some kind some other user similarly in kind of your brother sister okay suppose here is your like some documentation you have and you want to show it to your brother so you can give only the read permission to your brother to your other user like he can only read these files okay and what is the write permission suppose when you will give the read and write permission to this particular documentation file so in this case suppose uh uh they are in the same project with you so what will happen they can change these files also according to him and rwx is nothing but the read write execut it means you will give the all the permissions uh like execute permission we basically use for the some kind of scripts and all these things like when we will cover B scripting so you will get to know about this Dosh files and all or we can say Pi also for python files okay so these are the things uh for in the read write execute so I hope you got it what is read what is write what is execute so now here comes why I have written these 3 three three so here is the reason behind it the first section is only for the user the user uh whoever is the user they will have the like these permission right now they have R execute all these three permissions okay and next is for group okay and uh next is for uh wait a minute next is for home other or you can say some other books or some other on net you can get like other world or anything else like okay so uh these are the uh three three permission total nine nine permission we have three for user other three for group and other three for other like other world okay so here you can see in our system uh I will make a directory so it will be visible to you and I will try to uh create One Directory test one and uh touch file.txt LS Okay so like here you can see I have created two files like uh with when you will apply this uh semicolon then you can write multiple commands in one single line okay I hope you you got to learn new things okay so now I will do uh LSI funnel so here you can see uh the file permissions for uh user and D is for directory and this hyphone is for only for the files okay there are some also other notations uh which will cover over in advance video okay when we will executing commands Okay so here you can see rwx rwx that is how much it uh 3 is6 and again rwx okay so here in place of w you can see that is hyphen means it means zero like uh that other user is not having any permission to write anything inside the directory okay and this rwx r me they the user and the group have all the permissions okay I hope you got it so uh now what we have to do uh now I will tell you about some kind of like uh you can see numeric representation like how we can represent the uh what we can say um permissions of this so basically what happens this is in this uh wait a minute for R we basically give a number that is uh read wait a minute I will write here only here for R we give particular number that is four okay and for uh right we give it two and for one we give it for execute we give it one so overall when you will add all these numbers so for all suppose if you want to give all the permission to some kind of file so in this case you will provide this 777 okay it means you are providing seven for user also seven for group also other seven for other also and suppose uh and also one more is remaining that is zero what is zero 0 is nothing for no permission okay if you will uh give it zero to some other like uh for any case you will give it a zero then um they will not have any kind of permissions okay now Suppose there is a file that is uh suppose this documentation file I want to give this uh as a only uh read and write permission to the no rewrite execute permission to the user so in case of user I will write four + 2 + 1 that is I will write Seven Fold user okay and similarly for uh group what uh for group I just want to give them only what we can say uh write permissions okay so I will just give it them two okay it basically means 0 + 2 plus 0 like it will automatically like uh accept like uh that particular group has only right permissions okay and for other users suppose uh you want to give it as uh for other I want to give them as six like 4 + 2 + 0 so they will only have to read and write permissions okay so overall what we will write we will write 72 72 and six okay uh right now I don't have Mouse with me so I'm getting this problem okay so now so to give the permission to like uh for user you want to give them all the permission so we you can give it simply as seven for group suppose you want to give only the right permission you can give it two or suppose you want to give other all like only uh read and write permission so you can give it 4 + 2 that is six so the overall like uh number which you will provide in the CH mode command that is the uh 726 so what uh when you don't want to give any permission to the other user so in this case you can give it them as a zero suppose uh the same scenario like you want to give group as two so what you can do that is 7 to0 simple so uh I hope you got it the concept of read write execute and how this is divided like rwx rwx rwx what is these three like we have like a separate permission for Rite execute for one user then for group for other and also I hope you got this representation of numeric okay in binary also we can represent like for four I think we represent uh 1 and yeah let me write it for binary also so for binary we write 1 0 and uh for four for two I think we write uh uh it's uh 0 one0 it may be uh I hope I'm correct uh wait a minute so for two what we write uh 0 1 0 and the 4 one uh it's I think 01 it should be 0 0 1 okay so uh let me check it once also I don't want to like share wrong information with you guys uh for in binary it's one0 okay yeah here you can see 1 0 and for two it should be 0 1 0 yeah 0 1 0 is there uh we can get like 0 1 0 is there and for one we will get yeah it's user one okay so this is correct so in binary also you got to learn about how we can write in the binary also so uh that's all for today's video I hope you liked and now this video we are going to cover the one command that is the change mode or you can say CH mode also uh basically this command is used to change the permissions so this thing we have covered in our last video okay so now uh particular CH mode is one of the command that we basically use to change the permissions of the certain files or directory you can say okay if you don't want to provide uh permission to any user or uh any groups or anything any other user whom you don't want to provide access or want to provide access then you can use this particular command okay so now in this video uh first of all let me increase the size so it will be visible to you so now what we have to do I will create one directory that is um uh access dni like this now what I have to do I will create uh two fold fers or you can see director also secret one sec create to and one file that is private. txt okay now you can see I have done LS so these are all the files or directory which we upgraded now when I will do high high funel so you can get these information of the long format in the long format okay so I hope you are aware of this what is drwx uh okay and what is this hyphone I hope you but let me tell you one more time like what are these things so basically hyphone is for files are this for read so if we will provide read permission then you can read that file then if you provide WR then you can write that if you Pro execute then that file will be executable Okay so for uh for like in depth information you can watch our previous video on the permissions okay so now what we have to do uh today in this video what we will go uh going to do like we will change the permissions of certain files or directories okay so now uh the command which I was talking about that is CH mode it basically stands for change mode okay change mode of what files or directories so uh we have learned already learned the uh like two representations of this uh permissions like one is a uh numerical and one is alphabetical like when you will do rwx it is alphabetical and 421 is for what numerical okay so now what I will do I will first uh clear the screen unless I so now you can see the file permission of this private. txt so this uh uh is file and this is this like file has not any executable permission of this of the user or any other like on group also and for others it has only read permission okay so now what I have to do I will try to add uh executable permissions to this particular file okay so how can I do it so the most and simple approach is CH mode plus plus means basically when you want to add permissions to each and every like user group and others so then we will use plus so now what we have to do I have to use x like I have to add executable permission to this file then file name then enter now again I will try to check the permission so here you can see in users also executables has been added in groups also executables has been added and in what we say in others also executables has been added so this is the most basic approach for adding uh permissions in some files or directories and here you can see uh the color has been also changed because it has now the executable permission that's why color has been changed from normal to Green okay so uh what if you want to remove permissions okay so there is also way for it if I want to remove permissions like uh executable okay so what I will do minus x minus y minus B because we use minus to remove the permissions now again you can give the file name that is private. text again same thing I'll repeat LS ionl and here you can see executable permission has been removed from the user also group also and others also okay so this is the simple basic approach what if you want to remove like uh what we can say all the permissions so if I will do CH mode minus RW private. txt now here you can see all the permissions has been removed from this private TT like uh user has also no any permission or whether the groups has also not not any permission and others also have has not any permission so now what will happen I will try to access this file so let's see what happens here you can see permission is denied why it's showing this error because the read permission like we have removed the all the permissions so simultaneous read permission has also be removed okay so what I if I will add only the read permission okay what will happen now CH mode plus read then file name again I will do LS I funel and here you will see the read permission has been added to all the groups now what I will do I will try to access this file private. txt and here you can see uh but here nothing is written that's why it's showing like nothing is has been printed but uh now you can see we can access this but here also you can see the write permission is not there so what if I will try to write some kind of files some kind of thing or text in this fil then let's see what happens whether we are able to write or not so here you can see permission denied why because you don't have right permission to change uh uh to change anything in this particular file okay so uh I hope you got it like how this uh like we can remove permissions we can add permissions then how we can remove certain permissions uh together or add or remove okay like we did here like we we remove two permissions together in this case hyph RW okay so uh this approach is basically applies for if you want to apply certain permission for all the like for all these three like for the users also for the groups also and for the this one others also what if you want to apply permissions to only user okay so how will you do it okay so in this case what will happen how you can do it like uh let me clear the screen LS I funel okay now what I want to do I want to give the read uh sorry write permission to only the user okay so how I can do it CH mode then for user we use you and equal to is used to like assign certain only a specified permission to that particular uh user group or other okay now I will use here W and then private. txt and here you can see W has been added okay but uh uh yeah but read permission has been demo but uh so basically what happens here in this case uh when you provide this uh U equal to W so it only like what we can say it only are like uh add that permission and whatever you have a default permission it will get removed okay so when we'll use equal so it will just replace or you can say it will remove the other permission and it will add this new one okay so now what I have to do I will to uh like add re read permission again in this user so how I can do it CH mode U Plus read okay private. txd so here you can see we have added read permission as well in this particular file what if you want to give uh like uh write permission to this one to others uh two groups also for for groups there is a notation of uh what we can say G okay and again L if you do you can see right permission has been added and for others we use o again LSL and here you can see the right permission has been added in this private do txt file okay so in this way uh you can add remove permission for users for groups uh or for others okay so this is basically for the like what we can say uh alphabetical notation okay but uh but uh numerical notation is I think it's good to use like it is easy also you can easily understand but if you're bner you will think like yeah this is a easy so so now what I have to do I have I will remove all the permissions from this uh what F can say private. txt file so so CH mode minus RW from all it will remove the from all the okay new permissions are W minus uh okay uh let me try to remove like this like a equal to or 0 0 I can give yeah so now here you can see all the permiss has been removed why 0 I will tell you uh in a little bit now so now what we have to do we will add permissions in this particular file using the octal notation of the like this OCT notation of what we can say permission so uh uh let me uh like uh tell you those things again so that will be helpful for you so for octal notation what happens we use R = to 4 okay and uh we use uh WR to and execute equal to one okay so if you want to give the what means all permissions okay like read write execute to particular user or particular group or particular other okay so what you will need to do you will need to give it as a seven like you want to give four also you want to give two also you want to give X also okay so overall it is seven so let me tell you with an example so that will be easy to understand okay so now now what I will do CH mode 777 this seven is for first seven is for user second seven is for group and this third seven is for others so if I will do 777 it will give all the permission to all those user group and others and now I will do this hyph and and here you can see all the permission has been added to that particular private. txt file so now I will do some kind of changes I will again remove all the permission by applying 0 0 to all those okay so here I have removed all those permissions so now in this case what I have to do I have to only give the read permission okay uh let me open a text file for you uh or another terminal I will open so for R what we have four for write what we have two for execute what we have one so in this case what I want to give the user only I want to give them read and write okay so for user I will just write six okay and I want to give the group only right permission so two and I don't want any kind of permission to others so I will give it there as zero okay and then F name so now here you can see we have only read write permission to this user only write permission to the group and there is no any permission to the what we can say uh others okay so uh in this I hope you got it like how you can uh change the permission based on this OCT number I hope you got it like we have covered this in the last video okay so R = to 42 1 that is 7 if it is s then it will give you the all the permissions did that execute together okay now what if you want to uh give permissions like uh what you can say suppose if you want to change permission uh from read write for user I will just give them as a one let's see what happens so here you can see only like what you can say others has been added execute okay not anyone else okay so this is a happening I think because of we have provided only one one means uh there is not three values so now what we will do I will provide one to everyone let's see what happens you will see you have to only play with it when you will not play then you will not learn anything okay so that's all depends upon you so here you can see if I provided one to everyone so only execute permission has been added to all of them okay and if I provide two so let's see what happens only right permission has been added okay okay so I hope you got it uh let let me provide uh like uh for user I will provide only execute for uh group I will provide uh write and execute that is three another zero what happens same execute WR execute and zero okay so I hope you got it like uh how you can uh do or change the permissions with the help of this octal numbers and all okay so uh that's all for today yeah One More Concept is remaining here like uh when I will realiz hyph L here you will sometimes get hyph uh not hyphone you will get instead of X you will get some kind sometime s so s is nothing but a set uid it basically means like when you would provide the file uh like uh with that permission so what will happen it will run that particular file on behalf of you okay so uh let me uh check about the password uh one minute let iPhone user bin okay so here you can see the S and here who is the user root is the user and also here is root is the user I hope you know about the root user like this is the main user if if you are not able to run any F you don't have any then we you can use the root user to run run those file so here what happens this is the password is one of the command to change the uh password of your uh PC okay or your this machine so basically what happens when we run this password command so we basically run this password command on behalf of whom on behalf of this root user that's why we have given it them as a s permission that is a set uid permission okay what will happen when you will run this password command okay so what happens it will like say you changing password for I okay so I don't have to change right now so here what is happening this command is running on be of this root that's why we provide that as permission so this is basically a special permission you can learn more about this on the Google okay so I don't have to change okay I will just close the terminal that's all so I have you got it like how you can do with the octal representation with the uh alphabetical notation so that's all for today we are going to cover the most important topic of how this Linux series that is the user creation okay so basically in this video we are going to cover the how you can create users what are the files affected by you by creating that particular user and how you can create what are the root user sudo command and we are going to cover many things in this particular video okay so before moving forward uh I just want to discuss about a b a b a very basic thing that is what are the users okay I hope you you like U you're aware of it like if you're using this PC then you are the user if someone else is p using this particular PC and if he has or she has an account in this spe then he she or he is the user so basically what are the user users are nothing but you can say a particular person or particular entity what he can just like change the files and directories or he can do whatever he want uh okay so moving forward in this video uh I will uh like start with a very basic thing like uh categories or types of users in our Linux system okay so I hope this terminal visible to you okay I will just write right now I will just write things okay so the hash is basically just for comment okay so if whatever I will write it will like not execute as a command Okay so there are two types of user in all this Linux operating system that is one is root user or or you can say administrative user and other one is the normal user okay so what are the root users so if you're following this series then I don't think you are aware of the root user so but now we will cover it what is this so root user is basically that user who has access of the all the files in system like he he is just like administrator he can do anything he wants okay he has access of everything but what a normal user a normal user nothing but like like who doesn't have all the access okay so uh if you take uh like real life example suppose you are administrator of all this Windows PC or Linux PC anything okay and there is someone else who who has also access of this P but he is a normal user so uh I will just tell you like if you want to change the password of your of your account you can change it okay but if you want to change the password of or anything uh files uh of that other user then you can access it but that user cannot access the file of this particular what which user root user or administrative or administrator okay so basically the difference between uh in this is like normal user can't access the files of administrative user but in we can do it using the one of the functionality that is a pseudo command okay I will tell you what are the pseudo commands what is this how it works okay so this is all about the basics of difference between the root user and the normal user I hope you got it now moving forward uh now uh I will tell you about the studo command what is this okay but before it I will try to like uh cover one thing also the root user I will first set up the root user then I will tell you about the Pudo command what are the root users like I just discussed like he has access to all the per but by default in this obuntu root user doesn't work because it is disabled okay so to enable it what you can do you can just simply change the password because you know the root user is created you will just change the password okay so I will need sudo also because I I think it requires permission so the this pass WD is a command to change the user to change the password of any user so I'm changing the root here it is asking for my password and here I will try to add password of this root user okay so here we have successfully change the password of this root user so now to login as a root user what you can do you can change the switch user okay Su root means uh Su stands for switch user and root is there a username of that particular user and here I will type the password and here you can see the host name has been changed from iuse to the rout I will do LS here so that I have all the files I can see here if I will go to go back I will do LS here you can say test user has been created by me okay so that's all about it like root user now uh what I will do exit from this root user okay so we have created the root user and we have successfully set up the root user now moving forward the I was going to tell you about the pseudo command what is this Pudo Pudo what is the pseudo command like there is a boom of pseudo like if anything doesn't work then you will just apply pseudo and that thing will work okay so how it work basically that pseudo command is nothing but uh like um you can say how should I explain uh let me explain it by you an example suppose uh you have a file okay file.txt uh you you don't have access to it okay but if you want to access to it you can use the Pudo command to access it okay I'm just giving you an example so how it works basically uh Pudo command when you use it it will like uh it will work on behalf of the which user the root user okay the root user because root user has access to all the files okay so what you will do you will try TR to access that file on behalf of root user okay I hope you got it okay so but now there is a question like uh then every user like suppose I am this iush user I can access suppose I create some another user I us to then he can also access this particular administrative file but no the that's not a thing for this to work what you will need to do you will need to this I 2 into a sudo file that is some kind of file that is sers I think that that is the name I will goog it okay not remember I think this is the file sudo file it is there okay so in this file that particular user should be added or should be present to run sud sudo command okay so you will see all these things after when you will create a user and all these things you will see it everything okay so don't worry about it so I have you got it what is the pseudo command and all these things now moving on to the main topic of our this video is the user creation okay so before starting uh there are some Concepts which you should learn okay so I have already written it on this notion okay so the concept which you should learn the first and basic thing is uid what is the U ID U ID is nothing but uh user identification number you can say or user identifier so in Linux every user has their own unique ID okay so I will tell you my unique ID so if you will type ID and iush here you can see my U ID is 1,000 and G ID is 1,000 this is the group ID and groups and all these things okay so uh now you have to focus only on this this part U ID so now my uid is what 1,000 okay if I want to change look at the root ID what are the what is the U ID of the root so this is only zero okay so that's thing I have written here like the ranges of uid is from 1 to 500 only for uh so here for system users uid ranges from 1 to 500 and for the other users it starts from 1,000 as in the Ubuntu and Fedora it starts from 1,000 1,000 but zero zero is reserved for which user root user or administrative user it is just the root is just the username okay so this is the concept of the uid okay so now what I will I'm going to tell you like U ID I you got it the ID is zero for the root user and 1,000 for the iush okay this is the ID which is generated for whatever user you will create it will get added by one and one okay so now the next concept is uh the where the details of user is stored okay so there are some kind of files which are getting infected when you create a user the most uh like uh usual or you can say important file that is s ITC passwd is one of the file and other file is uh Slash uh the ETC shadow s it is just a directory it's just their location where it exist okay so the P pass WD and Shadow file are the two file which get affected and also there are some other files so those we will not cover right now so these are the two files which getting affected okay so now if you will see the content of the/ ITC pass WD okay so what you will see wow I don't think you will understand anything right now okay let me clear this screen but before that let me tell you about this what is the password file or P WD files okay so in this file basically uh the information is stored about the user it means what information the U ID okay their group ID their uh name okay and other information and also some other information like Linux log Lo sell information are stored in this particular file okay so if I'll do c/ CC let me increase the okay so the first entry is of which user the first entry is of the root user okay and the second X is just for the password like here uh password doesn't like uh it uh like it doesn't display here password it is password is stored in another file that is a shadow file okay in the hash format type okay and then this is the group ID uh this U ID group ID their group user group and uh their home directory and the shell which they are using Okay pin bash so there is the like uh I break every part of that particular like uh thing like there are seven what yeah seven separators or you can say seven Concepts you can say okay in this particular file so here you can see uh Mark Mark is what username X is what password 1,1 is what uid again 1,1 is what Z ID again here is the additional information okay and this is the home directory and this is the login shell so what is the login cell but before understanding the you need to understand what is cell cell is nothing but which provides you an interface okay to work okay you can understand and login cell is nothing but uh like whenever you log into the particular system then it starts working uh like you will learn about shell and Bash scripting or bash shell you will learn when we will start the bash scripting concept okay so there are also some other sales you can see uh like gnu cell cons shell jet shell okay so now what uh I going to do I will create a one user okay but before that yeah One More Concept is remaining here like SL CC Shadow okay uh we will uh come back on this point later on after creating user and also yeah here you can see my the first user that is aush and 1,000 is their uid GID and this is group addition info okay so now what I have to do I'll clear the screen and I will going to add uh some users in this particular video or so I will use sudo command why sudo because user add command uh like does not work directly you can try so if I will do user that it will give me the all the options but also if I will try to add user some kind of thing like some you can say which user test 22 so here you can see permission denied why permission dened because you don't have access to run this user add command because only root can add user so now what we will do we are going to add user on behalf of the root account okay that's why we will use pseudo now now I think you got the main concept of this sudo sud sudo user ad I will uh write some good name let's take uh mik no V Let's Take vat okay and uh sudo user add vat just uh this is the username now I will hit enter and the user has been created now to look at the file whether user has been created or not what I will do I will open up an another terminal okay and I will just read the password file and here you can see V user has been created and we still have not saved the password okay and the U ID has been given to that particular user 1,002 and another uh group ID has been given to 1,002 and this is the home we has been created but using user add command it does not reflect let's check whether it reflects or not if I do LS here you can see vat directory has not be created I will tell you everything how you can do it using user add command okay and the shell which are being used by this is being sh okay so uh like in this way you can simply like uh add user in know in your system now to change the password or assign the password what you will need to do the password command you will use sudo password vat password uh let's try same vat vat okay password updated successfully now the other file which come in roll in this uh user creation process that is Shadow file in Shadow file what happens like um all the passwords are stored in the hash format okay now uh let's take a look at the shadow file so you can see permission denied so what I can do I will just use sudo because now I will run this command as on behalf of the root user now it will ask you for the password just enter and here you can see vat okay so weat is there and this is the hash format of your password okay and uh next here is the when password created or password CH expired and or all things now let me open up this to simplify this uh yeah here you can see Mark dollar $6 this is the whole the like hash format encrypted password you can say and this is the when last password was changed then again their minimum password age and then maximum password Age Again warning period inactivity expiration unused all these things is like in this Shadow file you can get but we have not assigned any kind of those thing like expiry date all these things so that's why we are not able to say it so there are some uh encrypted password you can say what are the format like dollar type dollar short di dollar hash is the format to store your password so if it is one then it is MD 5 it is 2ay it is blow this is uh 2y uh e blow you can see all this thing if dollar 5 and 256 and 5002 now for dollar y it is yes script so it is also one of the method you can learn about it and now uh if you will learn about the last password change in this what happens it calculates from this state Jan 1 to 1970 okay and for expiry like it also like uh calculate from that particular day so I hope you got it the like what are the password file what are the shadow file if you want to take a screenshot you can take of this particular content so it will be helpful to understand you okay and for password you can this like you can take the screenshot of this particular part okay so so now uh what we have to do we have successfully created this particular user now what we will do we are going to log in okay we are going to log in using that particular username and password so how you can do SE and uh username weat and the password which you have set weat and here you are in this particular user shell so here you can see who am I that is vat if I do LS so you don't have permission because uh user simply just add the user adds the user so you will need to perform some other actions also okay so I will exit from this cell okay let me clear this screen here also and now what I'm going to do I will just uh like use the other options which you can use with the user add command okay like there are multiple options which you can use okay so to create a home directory which option we use we use hyphen M option okay and uh to create a like user with your own user ID then we use hyphen U option okay and to add some Comm commands we use hyphen C option okay uh wait a minute hyph C option so that's all and hyph S option is also used to assign the login shell Okay so so uh we can use this one by one or in a uh single command also okay so uh for your Simplicity or like uh to make it simple I will use first one by one then I will like um add uh everything in a single command now here I will I I'm creating hym V 2 Okay so so permission denied so I forgot to use sudo I will use sudo and again two has been created I will check the file Shadow file here we have not used password we have not set password yet sorry not Shadow I I have to use password okay so you can see vat 2 has been created with the user ID 13 and the home vat 2 let's check whether this home D has been cre or not I will do cd/ LS and here you can see V 2 has been created okay nice and I will now I will try to create some other user using hyph M also and also I will try to use hyph u i will assign some other ID like 1500 okay and also I will use hyphen C so okay so here this is weat three and hit enter oh sorry uh here I forgot to change the name of the user we had three so user has been created successfully again password so here you can see we had three x password we have not set yet 1500 is the user ID and the group ID this is the additional information which you wanted to give that is vat 3 home vat 3 and Bin bin sh is there it should be b bash to like reflect like this okay I I virtual box so uh now what I will do I will use hyphen s option let me increase this maximize it okay so hyphen C you have used and let's use hyphen s let me clear the screen first uh what happen uh wait a minute okay hon s SL pin bash okay what I will do I will first copy you can copy using control shift c yeah now I will do weat 4 okay so sudo user hyphen name what this it will do it will just like create a home directory hyphen you for assigning uh the particular user ID so 1500 we have already assigned let's assign like 1500 oh sorry 1,500 1 this is vat 4 iPhone is bin bash vat 4 okay we will hit enter and user has been created let's check in this particular file cat SL CC SL and here you can see V 4 15001 this is V 4 home and let's check home has not home directory so here you can see we 4 has been created now what we will do we will change the password of this particular uh user that is we 4 so how you can do it using Pudo command Pudo password we at 4 done now what you will do new password just enter anything which you want v v I'm just typing and password has been also added now what I will do I will try to access the shadow file so in Shadow file you can see the hash format all these things okay so now what I will do I will just try to log in using the vat 4 Su vat 4 oh sorry and then again enter the password and uh I think I have entered wrong password we at 4 okay no no no sorry it's password is only vat okay okay let's again change the password why okay caps lock is enabled no no no again change the password I will need to use sudo I forgot every time to use sudo now I will try to switch user okay so now where are you in the we at for home directory if you will do PWD you are in V 4 if you will who am I you are in V 4 okay so congratulation you have successfully created one user and you have like you have already you have set the password of it you have created the home directory for it everything okay done so now what you can do uh what you can do now yeah so uh you can see the multiple process we did in this like first we created user using user ad then we provided using hyph F option to create home directory then for uh shell we use hyph S option for comment we use hyphen C option and for uh and what else we used for U ID you used hyph U option okay so these these are the multiple option you are using the user add command so basically user add command is the lowlevel utility which means like it is earlier used but now it's there is also other utility that is add user that is a high level utility you can say okay so this is also useful because uh sometimes in kind of automation thing you need it okay or uh yeah but you should know this method also so now moving forward what I'm going to do and just uh let me uh like list all the so we are 2 3 4 has been greater 5 1 okay so now what I'm going to do I am going to add a user using the simple command that is uh add user command okay so how you can do it sud sudo add user and the username which you want to give I just want to give as a search in okay what it is showing me please enter a username matching the regular expression configured iPhone for okay I think I need to write as a small case in yes so here you can see you can't use capital letter okay so here you can see adding user search in adding a new group search in here group is is also added I I didn't talk about group in this video I will talk about in the later video okay and then you have to here only you have to enter the password like uh such chin and again you have to enter the password and here if you want to give full name you can give chendul room number 1 2 3 work phone 789 456 6 1 2 3 oh sorry sorry sorry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 home number 0987654321 other 09 8764 if you if you didn't enter anything it will be blank okay other is the information correct yes obviously why so now user hasn't created so this is a very simple command like in just one command you can create uh you can set the password you can add if any extra information you want to add okay so using this command you can simply do those things okay so if I will check the content of password so here you can see suchin one4 has been idea assigned to suchin full name their phone number whatever it is room number home number and the directory directory has been also created let's check LS so here you can see suchin and now let's log in using suchin now you are here and uh if you will do LS so there is nothing any file so in this way also you can add users okay so that's all for today's video guys I hope you liked it and uh if you have yeah if you have any queries then please you can ask us in the comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video with uh another concept so that's all so thank you thank you guys for watching this video and we'll meet in the next one thank you in this video we're going to talk about uh groups okay what are the groups in Linux operating system so basically as the name suggest you can think like a group as a like group of some kind of users group of politicians group of actors as this the name suggest but in in Linux we can create different kind of groups like we can create separate groups for developer for P for pentester uh different groups and for marketing team different groups so basically this is the basically mostly the use of groups like we can create different groups for different teams and we we can provide them the like different permissions according to their role so the there is a basic simple command inux like group AD okay using this command we can basically uh create groups in our operating system and I hope this is visible to you let me increase the size first it's too large let me need this yeah now it's fine so how you can do it uh the one command which I told you right now is group add and what you have to do you have to just provide the name of the group which you want so uh I will name it as a like uh developers okay so here you can see it is showing permission denied so one thing here also is like uh the group group add command is can be only performed by those users whether they are root or whether they have a certain permission of root permission or you can say whether they are in the sud file okay so in that file if any user in that particular file so they can easily uh use this particular uh feature of sudo command okay so I'm and that file like this user that J show what I will do I will just add sudo and it will ask me to enter the password done and we are done here you are not uh uh getting any kind of output or something but let me tell you one thing like when you create this uh uh or when you add this group AD command or you add different groups so at that time what happen there are the two files which gets affected when you hit this particular command one is uh one is group which are located in the/ CC directory and one another is SL Etc G Shadow okay so I will show you the content of uh group file okay like in Shadow file it basically contains the like when you create a group with password like they are not much required because uh like if there are multiple users then like uh your password will get uh like compromised you can think of of it okay so uh these are the two file which get affected when you whenever you create a group okay so let me show you the content of first c/ CC like group file and here you can see see there are the multiple group here okay there are multiple groups the first group it may be root okay this is the root and these are the some system users and here in the last video we had covered about V 2 3 4 so whenever you add a new user then the separate groups is also created okay so right now what we have added we have added developers okay so developers is one of the group and X is for password and this is the group ID okay so let me show you the detail information about this particular file so that will be more clear for you guys okay so in this picture you can see like CD roome x 24 and this we these are the users but in our case users are not visible why because we have not still added users in our group so we will do this in our next video okay so in this particular video we will only create groups like we will see different options how you can do it and here you can see the like U detailed information about that particular file so here you can see CD CD is what just the name of your group like here you can see one indicates the group name like it is the name of the group if you run LS and this command you will see okay and then this is for password which we have not provided this is the G ID that is the group ID and the group list like who are the users present in this particular group I hope that is clear to you okay so so now what I will do uh I will try to create a group with uh some another GID okay so for this we can use the only one option is that that is hyph g option which will help you to create uh like um group with different GID okay so but before that I want to tell uh I want to show you one more option that is hyph f option what it does sorry basically uh when you want to create a group with the same name then let's see what happens okay so I'm going to enter the same command again let's see what happens here you can see group developer already exist but what if you want like if you don't want to see this error message or you want to forcefully create that particular like developer group so in this case you can use which option you can use just hyph F option hyph F just stand for forcefully okay or you can say Force so in this case what will happen I will hit enter and here again you can see same developer 152 okay so now in this now what I will do uh wait a minute why my screen is not okay okay so now what uh I will do I will try to create a group with some different G ID okay so how you can do it uh for this we have a hyphen G option group AD and still I will use hyphen f option because I don't want to create some other groups I just want to work on this particular developers group hyphen app then I will use hyph G and I will provide this 2000 let's provide it 2022 and the name is will still remain same that is developers and I have not added sudo it's more important with the help of sudo you can per anything Linux just hit enter and then again we will see the content and here you can see okay it uh our GID not added here okay let me check we have entered correct command or not oh yeah there is a hyph option is correct uh okay let's try to create different group testers okay so what happened like when we we were using hph option then in that case we cannot change this uh GID but uh with other uh when you will create new group then you can uh change like U this GID like you can create your uh you you can create like uh group with your own GID okay so like in this way you like you learn something new like you can't do like that if someone asks you to perform the same thing then you can easily say no it is not possible to change this GID using iph option so uh now what I will do uh there is also one command that we can use like uh like for getting the list of users what I'm typing I'm typing this cash / cc/ group okay but instead instead of this we can use the uh one command that is g tent and uh then group and here you will get get the list of all the groups which is present in our system okay and to delete the groups you can easily uh delete it using the group D command that is very simple that is what I will group tell and I will just uh pass the name of the group which you want to delete I want to delete testers and hit enter again permissioned why because we have not used sudo let's use sudo and then again get list of uh that get list where it is okay so here you can see tester has been removed so I hope you guys like learned about how we can add groups in our L system and but in our further video we will see like how we can add users in particular different groups like there is also a separate command for this task that is a user mod or you can say user modification also like there are many uh properties of this particular command we will learn all about this in the our next video okay so that's all for it and we'll meet in the next video so thank thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in next one thank you this video we are going to cover the one command that is a user mode like as the name suggest it is the user modification command like with the help of this command you can modify the user details like their user ID you can modify their username you can modify or if you want to add those users into that particular group then you can also do it in this particular video so basically mainly we will focus like adding users into groups in this particular video in our next video we will try to cover the like uh extra things of whatever is the like user locking changing uh uid changing their uh what you can say uh their group name all these things we will cover in our next video so here is the scenario for you guys like uh there is a some kind of company and here you can see different teams are there like developer tester marketing team okay these are some kind of teams in that particular company and we have a different users like D1 D2 T1 T2 M1 M2 so basically suppose this this is our uh some kind of Linux server and in which we want to create different groups so there will be separate groups for developer separate groups for tester and similarly for marketing team there will be a separate group and these are the users so now what we will do we will try to first of all create all these user uh all these groups then we will create users and then we will add these users into that groups using user mod command okay so now first what we will check if we have uh that uh group present or not uh I have sorry okay so here you can see uh there is no any other groups present like developers marketing team and all other groups okay so now what we can do we can try to add those groups so how we can do it you can do it easily by using group add command and I will try to uh give the U ID that is 2001 and the name of the group that will be developers okay so it is showing permission denied why because we have not added sudo here because it runs only uh if you have a permission like uh that user should be adding that sud file so now I will need to enter my password and again let's check if this group is added or not so here you can see developers group has been added okay and 2001 is the GID and we have not still added any kind of user into this group okay so now let's uh create uh other groups testers I will try to give uid is uh 2002 again permission denied okay added and now marketing team okay 2002 already exist change the uid to three okay so now what we can do we can check if all the groups has been created or not so here you can see developers tester marketing team has been created now what we have to do we have to create all these users like D1 D2 T1 T2 M1 M2 okay but before creating group there is a one concept of primary and secondary group in our this Linux system so you will need to understand it first like basically what is primary group in primary group what happens when you create a one user or any new user so simultaneously one group is also created with them like suppose I have created a test okay a test user then test group will be also created okay so that is a primary group and what is a secondary group secondary group is nothing but uh like uh one user like will present in other groups also suppose this is a D1 user and uh he has a primary group of D1 and but he is also present in developer so developer is it what secondary group okay have you got it the concept of this okay so now what we can do I will add users so for users also we use Pudo command and we will use add user command not user add um name it as a D1 uh matching the regular expression okay so I think we cannot write num medical uh de one okay Sho add user day one is not okay let me check Okay add user that is sudo again I will try to create user oh sorry add user developer one okay so here you can see like developer one has been uh like uh username has been created now it is asking me to enter the password of that particular user so I will enter some kind like uh anything which I want and full name um I don't want to give and whether this information correct or not yes it is correct so this uh user has been created like to verify whether user has been created or not what you can do like as we have earlier learned like when whenever we create a user then the information is get stored or get added into the password file that is pass WD okay so we will check the content of that file sor sorry so here you can see our developer 1 has been created with the uid this and 101 GID what is z ID that is a group ID and this is uh his primary group okay so if you will check with the ID command of that particular user Dev developer one so here you can see their G is 101 and their primary group is developer one okay and groups in which groups uh this user is present so basically it is present in only one group that is a developer one because we have not added this user into that developers group so now what I will do again I will create another user um developer 2 okay let's enter password I don't want to provide yes done again now I will create for tester tester one same sorry why okay tester has been added now tester two no full name nothing required yes okay we have already covered this user creation you can watch our previous video okay so uh these two users has been added let's again check the content of that uh password file so here you can see developer 1 developer 2 tester one tester 2 has been added again last one is remaining that is which one marketing team okay so uh where that last command which we have run okay I will just write mty1 password okay nothing is required yes again mt2 password uh enter anything which you want nothing required nothing and then yes okay so successfully we have created all these three users and the groups okay as per this scenario like developer has developer one developer two tester one tester two marketing team 1 and marketing team two okay so now we will check whether all these things has been created or not for your like clarification c/ CC so here you can see all the six users has been created so now the main thing uh the main topic of our this video is user mod like user modification so now let's check the uh first of all check the like group of developer uh not developer let's check for tester one so here you can see G is this and group is this he is added only in this group particular and now let's check the like whatever the groups we have present so here you can see uh here one developers testers marketing team and also you can see developer one developer two this this this and why why this is happening because these are the primary groups for that particular user like when you have created that developer one user then simultaneously another group has been also created okay that's why this is a primary group now what we will do we will add this developer one user into this developers group and then we will check that uh like check with the ID command like uh um what are the other groups in which that particular user is present okay so now the role of user mod begins so let's start with this so basically uh user mod we will use it uh like this like user mode and then we will provide the name of the group in which we want and hyph a option hyph A is nothing for the append option okay I hope you are aware of append like appending something like uh uh Suppose there is a some kind of container and you are just appending into something things in it okay you can think of it like that and we will use hyph G option for the groups and the group name so what we want that is the developers I think this is the same name if I'm correct let me check it okay leave I'm correct I know uh developer one permission denied again because we have not used Pudo here and now let's check the groups of this particular user developer one so here you can see like uh G is 101 and the groups which in which groups this particular user is present so here you can see developer one this is his primary group and developers is his secondary group okay so again let's add other users also like uh developer 2 I will add this user into this developers uh what you can say developers group added simultaneously we will add uh uh users and testers group uh tester one I have written wrong name tester one okay added again for tester two added similarly for marketing team uh let me check the name of that uh particular group uh marketing team okay and here you can see like in developers we have you can see like developer one has been added and developer 2 has been added similarly in testers we have tester one and tester two okay so now what we will do we will add users into the marketing team let me clear the screen and and marketing team and uh username was mt1 I think mt1 okay added and similarly empty empty2 it was I think uh let me check the name of that particular user okay this is M2 okay added so now again we will check so now here you can see the developers group like what are the users present that is developer one and developer two in similarly in tester group we have tester one and tester two and in our this uh what you can see in the marketing we have uh M M1 and M2 okay so uh this is the like um thing which you should learn about like user modification like this is uh like what you can say important thing because uh when you will go in the corporate then maybe as a system engineer or whatever like Linux administrator then at that time you will get to know about this these things okay so uh that's all for this video and for user modification command like there will be another video for further details like how you can add the command add a uid and you can change the like old username to the new username so let me show you this command like how you can change it I have to change this M2 to M like marketing team 2 okay this is the user M2 and I have to change his username to marketing team too so how how I can do it I will just use user mod and then I will use the option hunel and the old username is M2 and the new username what I want is marketing team two okay user mod what is it showing user marketing team 2 does not exist why it not exist I'm just okay maybe the new name will come up here permission denied sud sudo okay again let's check the group name if it is changed so okay here you can see marketing two like from M2 to marketing to the name of the username has been changed and also you can verify it from this uh our password file here you can see it is marketing to okay so that's all for this video and in our next video we will cover up the other options of user mod command Okay so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you so basically we have already covered the how we can add users into another groups so now we will also like do some other operation like for this we will I will just create another user uh I will use the command add user using sud sudo and I will give it the name as a funny name Let's uh create with a hacker man uh sorry yeah new password hackerman hackerman I think yeah I have written correct I will not provide any kind of extra information just uh yes okay done so to check whether the user has been created or not what we do we check the this file that is hacker man has been created here you can see the with u id18 and G id18 okay so uh for login so how you can do it you can just switch uh user Su hackerman and the password hackerman so here you can see we are in this the hackerman directory okay so when you do LS so nothing you don't have permission LS okay here you can see all those kind of things log out I will use exit Okay exit we use it for uh like uh close that particular session of that particular user so now what we can do we we will just uh try to uh change the username of that uh not username uh I will add the first some kind of commments in that particular user so how you can do it user mode hyph C so here I will use hyph C option okay to provide some comments so let me provide like uh I a hacker okay and the name of that particular user hacker and I will use sudo like uh because we can't use normally this command okay so now let's uh check the sorry not I don't want to switch I need this one yeah so here you can see the comment has been added like I'm a hacker so in this way if you want to like uh add some kind of commments like in our previous video you can see like uh there is a developer section and if you want to add some comment to that particular user then you can add like this is first developer this is second deop veler or his ID is this his ID is this okay and kind of this kind of things you can do okay so now moving forward what we can do uh we can also change the uid what is uid uid is just the unique identifier number uh which you can change of any particular user which you want so how you can do it simple just provide uh hyphen which option U option and then U ID which you want so right now what it is one8 I will give it as two8 let's hit enter and again uh let's check this content of that particular file and it should be change yeah so here you can see 2008 this is the U ID and what is this 1 this is the G ID okay but we have what changed we have changed the U ID okay so uh we have covered now hyphen c hyphen U now moving forward and uh if you want to change the username of this particular hackerman like from hacker man to if you want to change it like um best hacker like this like this kind of thing if you want to so how you can do it uh I will use again Theo user mode okay and I will use hyphen L option for changing the username hyph L and the new username which you want I want uh sorry uh I want uh best hacker okay I will hit enter and uh again check here so here you can see the name from hacker man to best hacker like it has been changed so in this way you can also change the uh like username of your um okay you can change the username of your particular user if you want okay and also the most like important thing is here you can use hyphen e option also okay okay uh Hy option what it will provide it will just add the like expired date like when that user should be get disabled so you can do it using the just one option that is the user mode hyphen e is stands for expiry and the particular date on which you want okay so today is uh 28 I will provide it as a 30 okay 30 no not in this I think year month and then 2022 and then month that is 8 and 30 okay I will hit enter and the hacker man doesn't exist yeah because we have changed the name from hacker man to which best hacker best hacker done let's check whether it is reflecting or not it should okay but here it is not reflecting it reflects in I think shadow file okay so uh in this way you can also add the expiry date uh and uh one more like important command is that locking and unlocking of user account how you can do it in this so for this option we use the capital L option okay to lock a user so in this what happens like uh the that user can't log in using the username and password like but other methods are required like key based or switching user like which we did here earlier okay so to loog the user what we can do user mode hunel uh capital n and the best hacker permission denied why we have not used sudo H enter we have loged the user if I will try to not right now uh first of all I have to delete some users uh like I'm Linux marketing these all the users I want to delete uh how you can do it sud sudo user Dell uh I'm Linux marketing maybe I simultaneous if I um I don't know I can do or not mty1 tester 2 tester one developer one developer two okay okay but I don't think I'm succeed or not I don't think okay so no I am not uh like able to like uh delete that users like simultaneously okay so I will need to do one by one let me do it first because I have to just show you like I am not able to log in using the usern and password okay so user Del developer one again developer developer two again tester one tester two marketing what is the name of the user that mt1 done again it is marketing something marketing to done I am Linux I'm Linux done okay so we have deleted all the users like extra users which we had created earlier okay so now let me check the again that file okay so here you can see on the best hacker is there so now what I will do I will try to like uh uh switch user from here okay uh wait a minute it's like yeah not listed it's not swing yeah it is not showing okay so when we will unlock then we will try to check whether it is uh like visible or not that option of particular that user okay so I think if we have locked it that's why it's not visible to us okay so uh now to unlock the particular user what you can do you can you have to just use hyphen new Option okay but before that I will show you this one like if you are able to switch or not uh I don't think we are authentication failure okay okay Authentication phas will be there yeah I'm correct so now what if we have blocked the user now what we can do we will provide this hyph you option it will unlock the user okay so again let's check whether we are able to log in or not so now now we are able to login so when you will log the user you can't just uh login or anything for like using username and password okay so here also if we try to check whether the name of that particular user is available or not switch user just wait for a minute like it takes sometime so here you can see I am a hacker why it's sh because we have added that comment okay so it is showing okay but I'm still logging into my account oh I have added wrong done okay so uh that's all for this this video guys I hope you learned about like how you can uh edit the username add commments uh like editing username like mostly we want to edit okay and most and we will not use hyph l option like we don't want to lock anyone okay so uh you can do it or uh if you have guys any problem with this particular video or our previous video then you can ask us in our comment section okay so that's all for today and we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and if if you have not subscribed our Channel then please subscribe it guys okay thank you this video we're going to cover about uh head command Okay so head command is nothing but a simple command that we basically use to get the uh starting content of a particular txt file okay so uh when we will demonstrate and then you can easily get okay so let me open up the terminal I hope it is visible to you you okay I first create One Directory with head okay and I will create two files touch no I will create with cat command cat states. txt Okay and already I have entered the whatever the states okay I will just copy it here and I will paste it there okay enter control D to save and I will again create another command that is a capital. txt okay let me like this and again I will copy from this okay contr D Okay so so we have created two files you can check with the list command if I will try to read the first here you can see and if I try to read second file that is capital here you can see okay so now we will use the head command okay so what I just said you like what is a head command head command is nothing but which we use to print the starting content of a file so how we can get it to Simply the command is head and just provide the file name whatever it is st. Tex let's suppose okay and print uh I will hit enter and here you can see the first 10 lines you will get so by default what happens when you use the head common you get the first 10 lines of a txt file so you can count here also like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 okay so this is the one of the feature of the head command okay so if you want to like suppose you want to print only first two lines okay for this what you can do you have to nothing just provide the like u high and option how you can do it head hyphen hand 2 and states. txt so here you can see we have only just got the only first two lines if you want to print first five lines then also you can do it like from five okay so and what if you want to like uh get the content of two files simultaneously how you can do it so it's also a simple Comm of it is like head uh st. txt and what was other capital. txt hit enter so here you can see the first 10 contents of both the files okay so now what if you want to print only first five first five line of both the files so you can see here you can see 3 + 2 5 3 + 2 5 okay so here we are getting five lines and here also we are getting five lines so with the help of hyphone and option we can easily uh get the whatever uh number of lines which you want to like display in the on this terminal okay and also there is another option that is a hyph c option what it does so hyphen C option is nothing but like which we we use to get the uh like content of a particular size okay suppose if you want to print the content of only first like 30 bit or 10 bits so then for this we can use a hyphen C option okay so uh let's use it hyph C I will provide uh for states. txt so here you can see a and DH why this because this is only four bytes okay first four bytes it will provide us and what if I want to hit 12 so here you can see it is just me providing me the 12 bytes okay this is uh 3 3 6 7 and again this is 5 7 + 5 that is a 12 bytes okay so in this way you can use the hyph C option and also you can use I think together also for Capital let me use and you can see in s. XT you are getting this and in hayb you are getting this okay so uh and also there is one more option is remaining in this like hyphen V option what it does it basically just provide you the veros information iph stand from verbos which basically shows you the like information about execution of command like that let me use it for States so you can see st. txt like if we not use hyph V option then let's see what happens nothing okay so that's all guys for this particular video so I hope you liked it and we will meet in the next video okay so thank you thank you for watching now in this particular video we're going to learn about the tail command Okay so similarly just like a head command tail is also one command in but in this we uh like uh expect output from the downside or you can say the we try to get the output from the bottom of the txt file or any file like uh from which we want to like extract some kind of data like suppose you want to extract data from a loog file like you need last 10 number of lines if you need okay so in this case we can use the tail command Okay so uh the basic uh uses like you can try to learn about uh like how you can read the log file using tail command and all these things so these are the basic uses of this so uh I have already two files uh st. text and capital. txt okay so let me show you these two files so this is the content of states. txt and this is the content of capital. txt okay so on these two files we are going to use the tail command okay so I will use first tail command on the test.txt so what it will do let's check so it will just print the last 10 lines okay so here you can see they just printing the last 10 lines you can like get the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 okay so using just simple tail and the file name what you will get you will get the by default last 10 lines but suppose if you want more more lines suppose if if you want 15 lines so how you can do it so nothing you just have to use hyphen and option and provide the number of lines which you want so I just want 15 so here I got the last 15 lines okay so you can use hyphen n option to get the last number of lines and similarly uh there is option of hyphen C option like which will provide provide you the like um what you can say last number of specific bites if you want suppose if I want uh 13 bytes I will use just hyph C and 13 so you can see I'm getting just West Bengal let me try higher number 16 again I think I will get same okay nothing uh I I got like this West Bengal and and okay suppose if I want uh 20 btes uh sorry if I want how much 20 so here you can see I'm getting 20 bytes let's count like w 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and also there will be like uh some kind of particular size for spaces also okay so in this way we are getting the 20 bytes like a specific bits okay not bits bytes it is okay so you can use the hyph C option to get the a specific number of bits okay from a txt file or any kind of file so now if you want to get the like uh last 10 lines of both files how you can get it just simply use this command test. uh hyph in and the number of lines then provide the files file name which you want so I need the data from two files so you can see you can get easily like from capital. TX these are the last 10 lines and from st. text these are the last 10 lines okay so apart from this uh there's also a like very interesting thing uh in which you will learn in this particular video that is a monitoring any like uh any txt file Suppose there is a log system or something like that and if you want to monitor it so how you can do it it you you can use it just by applying tail command by which option you can use by using hyphen f okay so let's do it tail hyph app st. txt okay so uh first let me show you the content of stress. text so that will be clear to you so you can see at the end we have only West Bengal okay so now I will use tail hyph F states. txt and here you can see like it has printed the last 10 lines and it is my monitoring this file so now what I will do I will just open up the again new terminal I hope it is visible to you I will move into the head directory and I have these two files and what I am going to do I will append some data in a st. txt and uh then here you you can see if I write something then it should reflect here hello okay so you can see Hello has been added if I want uh if I want to print Linux Fair India so here you can see whatever I'm writing here whatever I'm adding in this particular file it is get to monitored by this system like tell if we have used hyph app option to monitor this t. text file so whatever we are doing changes in that particular file it is reflecting here so like this you can also use this uh particular thing in the like uh log monitoring system okay so I hope you liked it like that was the interesting part of this particular video I hope you like it suppose we WR anything else okay so here you can see it is getting like reflecting here okay and all these things will get added into this particular st. text file now I will just save it and and now again I will try to check the content so here you can see all those extra contents has been added in that particular t uh St store txt file so that was the like uh most important or you can say most interesting thing of this particular video so I hope you liked it and please if you have any queries regarding this video so then you can ask us in the comment section okay so we will meet in the next video so thank you thank you for watching in this particular video we're going to cover about the CH own command that basically mean change ownership command Okay so before starting uh let me tell you the brief or little bit introduction about this command basically it means what as the name suggest that change ownership what does it basically means uh let's take a scenario of a corporate world okay in which you are working in a team and there are people with different roles okay and if you have access of some kind of file and you want to share that file to some another team okay so in this case you can use the CH own command okay like there will be one particular group for one team and you want to give that access to some other team member or some other group member you can say okay so it basically mean changing the ownership of a file or transferring the ownership uh to some other people or to some other user okay so we will start this uh okay so but before starting uh I will tell you to just uh set up your root account okay but because we will use root account and also one another user to perform this uh uh particular ch1 command Okay so to set up a root command first of all what you have to you have to just uh change the password if you don't know so enter the password command and the username that is a root and you have to just use a shudo and and now you can enter the new password which which you want okay password red successfully and one more thing what we have to do I will add another user add user and I will give the name as uh ainash okay so enter a password I will not provide any kind of information okay yes okay so user has been created now what you will do first log in as a root in this terminal uh wrong password I enter wrong password yeah now I I'm logged in as a root user here you can see root and now again I will open up another terminal in which I will log in with the credential of ainash uh I hope it is visible to you now yeah it should be visible to you guys so now what we have to do uh we have to just log in as a different user that is a uh aash okay just enter the password of that particular user uh test uh a okay so here we you can see uh I have another user in this terminal another user in this terminal okay so this is the root user and this is the ainash user okay so now both the user are in the home directory let me do here also same thing okay so both the users are in the home directory okay so now what I have to do to see the permissions or uh to see anything uh permission of a file or directory or anything else which you want what what command you enter just you enter LS hyphen l y l just a long listing of files you can say like that okay so here you can see we have we have three directories and these are the some permissions based on those directory that is rewrite execute read and then for others there is no any permissions okay but the these are regarding what you can say these are regarding your um users like this is the users directory but we don't have to work on this I will work on some different directories or different files okay so what I will do I will just create a one file that is touch file.txt and I will do LS hyl and that particular file name so here you can see in this case uh if you have watched our previous videos on permissions okay so I think you will get it easily so these three represents the permissions of users and this is for groups and these are from others user so here you can see uh groups has only read permission and other others also has only read permissions okay but uh uh uh this particular user has a read and write the permission okay so who is the owner right now the owner right now is Root Root is the owner right now okay so now what uh you have to suppose or you have to think like that you have to share this file. Tex to someone else to ainash okay this user you have to share now what will happen let's do LS and I will try to access this file so I hope I can access because others have read permissions so let me H enter this command so here you can see we have not got any error like permission denied so now what I will do I will just add one line in this particular file hi this is root user contr D to save okay and now again I will try to access and here you can see I am able to access this file but if I will go to change the permission in this particular file then at that time what will happen we will get an error of permission denied why why we will get error the reason behind is this that we don't have execute permissions okay so now what we have to do uh if I will try to add some extra lines in this file.txt so how we can do file. TT let's see if we are able to add or not so here you can see permission denied so okay as I said earlier like if we don't have permission like execute permission so to change the to change in the file okay so to do this uh we have two options one is change ownership just for one particular user or simply add execute permission for others using uh CH command okay uh change permission like CH mode command okay you can use uh that command to change the permission for all the users but but uh that is not a useful case or that is not a best scenario because you don't want to share that file to all the users okay so that's why CH own command came into this role and that's why we are using it so how you can do it just use Chon and whatever the username you want to uh uh here our username is uh this particular username is I ainash so ainash and I will just uh provide the file name and done now I'll do LS I funel and here you can see AAS is now the uh new owner of that particular file so LS iph let me do do one more time yeah here you can see Ain is the new owner sorry and uh now if I will try to change in this particular file then obviously I will be able to change here I will add just uh this line has been added by ainash control D to save and again I will try to access and here you can see this line has been added by which user ainash okay we can also uh use multiple options with the Chon command like Chon hyphen C for uh what you can say for informations okay like it will display just like uh information like uh a permission has been transfered from this user to this user let's do this uh with this again let's hope it works or not let's see uh CH on hyphy and I will provide the username that is ainash and file okay it's not showing me V okay ownership file. retained as ainash okay here you can see we have used hyphone V for warus it just displays the extra information yeah it's still a okay so no worries so in this way CH own command works okay so I hope you like this video and I hope you got the concept of how Chon works okay so that's all for today's now in this particular video we are going to cover about CH group command it basically means the change group or you can say the change group ownership okay from one group to another okay to understand this uh uh command just think like a basic scenario Suppose there is there are the two teams in a company that is the one for uh tester and another for the you can say uh that developer okay uh suppose uh tester wants to share uh one file or uh to some other group members that is uh they these are some kind of group members okay so uh not uh for a particular member of that group but uh this team tester team wants to share those file to all the groups so in this scenario we can easily use this CH group command okay so in this kind of scenario it will be helpful um because uh you don't have to share that file to one particular uh user okay so that if you share that file or change the ownership from from file to that group so every member of that particular you group can easily access the can easily access that particular file okay so to understand this scenario first what we will need to do we will first need to create a group okay I hope it is visible to you guys uh so to add groups uh what is the command so the command is nothing but the group AD and uh group name okay so what we will do group add and let's make a group name as a developers permiss because we have not used sudo uh sorry I have enter wrong password I think yeah group has been created uh now what I will do I will just uh create two users add user user one again we have to use sudo password no extra information I have to provide yes user one is added user two test test yes both the user has been created now what we have to do we have to just uh uh add those two users into the developer group okay so how you can add the those two users into the developer group so for that also we have a particular command that is a user modification so I will use sudo user mode hyph a and uh uh we use I think Hy and the group name is developers and the name of the user that is a user user one and user two I hope it should work again not working user one if I provide oh yeah added and again user to okay so groups has been added uh these two users has been added to the developer group to check what you can do G10 and group okay so here you can see user one and user two and in developers we have two users that is user one and user to okay so uh now what we have to do uh I will create one file with our root user so first of all what I will do I will change my like switch to the root user user I will go move back to directory in LS okay we have file.txt I will first remove file.txt and test okay both are you now what we have to do I will create one file that is touch file.txt okay so if I will change check the permissions for this particular file so here you can see we have root root the user is root and the group is also root user so in this case what we have to do we have to just change the group ownership not user like this one we have to change this group ownership to some other users or to some other group so but in this case here you can see in the permission we have the group has only read permission okay so now uh what we can do uh we can change the group uh from root to which group that is a developer group so for this we have a command that uh is CH group so how you can do it CH group CH grp and the group name is developers okay developers and uh then what we have to do we have to just provide the file name okay now I'll do lsph and file.txt and here you can see the group name has been changed from root to Developers okay so now what I will do I will log in using uh both the user Su user one and I will enter the password test and again one more terminal I will open up here uh like this I will increase the font size so it should be visible to you and Su which user that was user to okay and again enter the password same thing move back here also the same thing I will do I will move back one directory and I will do LSL and file.txt and here you can see developers and again here developers okay uh wait a minute um what key I just entered here LSL file.txt okay so here you can see in both the scenario we are getting developers as a group okay so now what I as a user one I will try to uh like change the some file content file.txt and here you can see it is showing me permission denied why it is showing permission denied because here you can see we have not added any kind of permission he has just read permissions okay so now what we can do uh okay so we have only the read permission here for the groups okay so if I will just uh try to access so I can just only read this file.txt but if I want to uh add some kind of text or add something in that particular file so here you can see the permission is denied so now what we will need to do we will need to just add a permission for the groups for that particular file okay so how we can do it using the CH mode command just because uh we don't have uh like execute permission to the groups that's why we are getting this error so CH mode what you can do for group G+ I will do uh write and execute and I will remove the read permission uh for others and the file name that is file.txt and done and uh now in this case I will just check so here you can see uh read right execute has been added for groups and uh uh read has been removed from for others okay and the group is developers as we performed earlier so now what we can do uh uh if I will try to access this uh file that file file.txt so now let's try for user one I will remove all those things so cat file. dxt so here you can see I will just hi this line has been entered by user one control D to save and again here also uh I will I will here I will try to access this file uh sorry file.txt and here you can see that line I'm getting and for uh user two also I will try to enter some line with respect to user two that is high this line has been added by user 2 contr D to save and again I will try to access so let's access by user one uh not user one uh it's file.txt and here you can see both the lines has been added and it is accessible by both the users so this is the benefit of like group command like uh you can um you don't have to share that file with each and every user Suppose there there is a team of 50 members okay so uh you you you can't like you can't just share those file to all those 50 people separately okay so that's why uh we have this group command change group owners ship and just uh like that file will be accessible by each and every group member so guys that's all for today's video on this video we're going to start to post videos on networking okay like whatever the commands which are used in the networking domain in our Linux operating system those are the commands which we will learn so basically we will start with the First Command that is the Ping command Okay so before starting uh the Ping command I hope you are aware of a basic of networking if not then let me tell you about like from a scratch okay so these are the computers for suppose this these are the two computers okay A and B are the two computers and they are connected to each other so now what happens in this they basically form a kind of network what happens when multiple devices connected to each other okay so that process just called as a networking okay so in the networking to are many Concepts like uh what is an IP address what is a MAC address uh like different network topologies okay so we don't have to discuss that much thing particular in this video so basically you just need about what is an IP address okay so uh let me tell you about the basics of IP address that uh uh you can think one of analogy is like U uh what you can say just like uh in a family uh everyone has a separate name okay suppose one one name is aush ainash anit anything okay they suppose they are the siblings and they know each their names okay so similarly in our Network what happens each device has their own name or their IP address okay so basically an IP address just an address which identifies a device on a network okay I hope that is a clear to you so what is an IP address and also there's a concept of Mac address so Mac address just you can think like of it as a fingerprint of a person suppose a person changes his name or her name but he can't change their fingerprint okay it will be always same so that's why Mac address is just like a permanent address that is like a printed on your NC card okay in your PC so now we will start with the Ping command uh let me enter the password I hope the terminal visible let me increase the font size okay so now what is a ping command so ping command is basically a simple command which you basically use to uh check whether the our like host is reachable or not suppose I will enter google.com so what google.com is kind of one of the host okay or you can see domain name so I will try to check whether I'm able to reach there or not okay ping google.com so here you can see I'm getting multiple uh request from them now I will just hit contr C to stop it okay so here you can see this is the 64 bytes uh like uh packet size what so now what is a packet okay so packet is basically just like a data you can think of it like a data that is that transfer suppose you send a image then it it gets divided into different small small small packets or chunks then it is transfer so packet is just like a you can think as a small data okay so basically what happens when you ping uh and when you use a ping command so it uh basically what sends the icmp Eco request which basically means that is internate control message protocol request okay so icmp is just a one of a protocol that is used by the Ping command okay to like for that these are for this purpose like for receiving or for sending like Eco request and Eco response is one of the thing which comes in this role okay so whenever it send that is called as the icmp Eco request and whenever it receive that that is called as the icmp Eco response okay so there are multiple attributes here you can see like what is this uh sequence number dtl okay so I will cover like most important things first this is from it means it is just and the what you can say it is just the IP address of this google.com Okay so google.com is identified by this IP address like from where this request is coming that is 64 bytes is coming from where so it is coming from this IP address this is maybe the domain name or something like that or servers maybe uhuh we don't know about it what is this okay which domain from where this is coming but we know that this is the IP address IP address of this Google.com this is a TT is nothing but the time to leave it basically means like how many hopes or how many routers uh this process has covered okay and time is just like uh how much time it took to get the response or send the response it basically means what happens the total time the first this is our PC this is google.com Okay so it will ask for are you there are you alive or not Google uh reply goog will just reply yes I'm alive okay so uh this is the total time that is uh here it is where it is uh here this one this is 133 millisecond okay so at what happens at in one second there are at least I think four to five packets or request four to five request are s okay so ping command we basically use for the like internet connectivity purposes further we will check about another command that is the trace rout ip config if if config sorry we'll learn about all those things I hope uh you liked this video and now in this video we are going to talk about the most important command that is the trace root command okay so now in this video we will discuss about this particular command so before starting the actual implementation of this command let me discuss with you like basics of this Trace root command okay so what are the basics of Trace root command as a name suggest Trace root what does it mean it just means you are tracing a root okay uh just uh uh think like an example like you have to go from like uh Mumbai to Bangalore okay so you can go from different routs and you will first Trace like how you can go to that destination Okay so Trace root is a command which is used to find the what are the number of hopes hopes means you can say number of routers which are included between your source and the destination okay so we will start with this so basically uh actually I have an image for you also like Suppose there is a source and this is the destination and these are the number of routers included between the source and destination okay so Trace rot is a command which will tell you like what are the number of hopes present between source and destination like in our this today's implementation we will see uh like the number of hops which will be uh included between our this local machine and the google.com Okay so for in actually Trace does not come with preinstall so we will need to install it like if you hit this command then you will get uh this error message or you will get a suggestion to First enter this command to install trer so we will do this sudo AP install AP just a packet manager you can say okay and password and now it will install your Trace root command Okay so it will take a little bit of time uh let's wait for for it so it's also just like a trace root command just also you can say like a ping command okay like we can use it also for checking the whether uh the particular server or particular host is reachable or not okay so uh now we will start with the trace root command Okay so first of all uh I will clear the screen and high PR visible to you so Trace root google.com Okay okay so here you can see the first uh for is 10. 0.2.1 it's like basically the uh what you can say gateway address like the first address through which my PC is getting connected and the star means like it is whether we are not getting any response or something like that okay so here you can see we didn't get any kind of response I don't know why uh this is it's showing me star star star and star means unreachable host you can say like uh or not unreachable it means like you are not getting response okay and the maximum hopes uh can be it will try for 30 okay uh let me again check whether my internet is working or not okay internet is working fine okay five packet transmitter five receive 0% loss let me try with again Trace root with DNS server let me try first gateway again same the ST means like not responding uh here you can see the maximum hopes can be 30 okay I that should show something okay let's hope okay so it's still uh asri so it's not still we are not getting response okay let me check the network setting here okay it's some bre adapter okay uh let me try again Trace root google.com first is get okay yeah now now we are getting here you can see from second and third hops we are not getting any kind of response so asri basically means uh we we are not getting any response from that particular router or you can say hopes okay so now here you can see the first is Gateway like gateway gateway just means like the very first router or very first uh you can say what you can say gate uh like through which your packet will pass like the very first router you can say Gateway just like a your first router okay suppose you are connected to a Hotpot okay then your phone will be off it will act as a first router okay first gateway or whether your phone is connected to the your ISP or anything else you can say or just take an example of your WiFi if you're connected to a WiFi then the first request will be passed through your WiFi then it will connected to some other router then another router then another okay then finally you will reach to the destination so here you can see uh we are getting many results here like uh uh I think we have covered approx 14 hopes here okay let's check whether it will come in one line let me increase this okay uh I think now it's better yeah uh so now uh here you can see the first gateway like from which we are getting the response and these are the time like uh what you can say uh round trip times like uh from like when we go and then when we come back then the overall time okay so here you can see uh the different IP addresses uh of different routers then the total time taken by them these are all the details you can see and at the last head you can see we reached to the destination okay and uh okay we reach to the destination yes so it overall take 84.1 for 1 millisecond okay so uh again let me try with uh some other uh website like let's take a IBM ibm.com I think my internet connectivity is slow today that's why taking much time so you can see you're getting different uh IP addresses of different routers okay let's wait okay so we have covered seven rades 10 11 12 13 we are not getting any kind of response again no no response no response we're getting oh my God okay I think maximum hope is 30 so I don't think it will get complete okay okay no problem let me think about some other website uh Which is popular one uh let's take take uh which website should I take man Trace root uh let me search for any website booking.com okay let's Che for booking.com booking.com I hope we should reach like here you can see like all this line represents the information about that particular hopes like the fifth one is the the IP address of that hope is this like 2231 19625 okay and also it shows us the round trip time round trip I hope you got it like uh uh from sending packet to receiving back like from requesting to response okay this is the round trip time so here you can see we have got a still uh seven hopes uh let's wait it's 8 now okay I think we have reached uh like we're getting this booking.com so approximately we have Reed okay now it will get uh yeah completed Okay so here we are not getting any kind of responses from the particular uh what you can say particular hops why it happens it may be because of they are unresponsive or they are turned off or whether it's also because of the firewall reasons like some of the firewalls does not reply back to this ping request or icmp packet here also in t also we are sending that that icmp packet like internet what the what was the for form that it is internet control message protocol yeah we can say it like that okay so some of the routers are not routers some of the firewalls does not reply back to those packet that's why we are getting this it may be one kind of reason or whether they are a turned off we don't know okay but still here you can see we have approximately Reed because here I can see the domain name of their of their website that is booking.com okay so it may be one of the reason uh also we can use uh some different options with this stress root command like hyphen n options for like better view let's try uh with hyph and what looks like let's try drro hyph and let's go with our Google baba okay okay now damn and you can see like uh as soon like very fast we got the result so here you can see 192 uh first hope second third un responsive one8 17.24 a211 whether it is the our last node uh let me check with ping I don't think because it start with 142 yeah okay so this is not the address which we expecting M but 142 251 okay so here it should show me that particular uh like the last uh IP address I was expecting this address okay let's try with uh other website.com not yaho it's Yahoo okay I have not used hyph and option let me use that okay so here also we can see like 74.6 dot like here you can see the first 10 octed and second octed is same then we can we are in in the network we can say like that okay so basically like T command just used to find a number of hopes which lies between the source and the destination okay so we are getting a and not getting response just because of their firewall uh settings like uh uh it shows us the like don't reply to the icmb packet maybe for the security regions uh because uh there is a tool in in our Linux or k Linux system that is the nmap which we use for the network scanning okay so we also face that error because when we go with the network testing then in this case uh we basically get that error so that's why uh no any company or no any organization want to uh what we can say they don't want to replace anyone you can say like that okay so that that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and yeah if you have any queries then please uh ask us in the comment section yeah but before ending this video I have to show you one more thing for you like for Windows I know it's still uh Linux series but uh T rot is a command which we can use on both windows and the Linux but in Windows we just uh use this one t CRT and again let's enter google.com and here you can see the first hope it is taking 32 2 millisecond 2 millisecond and the IP address the IP address of the first hope okay so let's wait for some time it I don't think it will take much time uh okay for second H request timed out again yeah yeah I will take just I don't think more than 15 seconds now so here also it is just sending the icmp packet request okay when we will start with the networking if in future then you will get to know about the what are the different protocols used okay like for web we use sttp stps protocol and also we use different uh for remote connectivity we use SSH FTP so we will learn all about these like how we can do with all these in our Linux operating system let's wait now8 hops I think in Windows it's working fine um now nine it is unresponsive maybe yeah two stke three and the third one will come up yeah and the 10th one is here let's check what will be the IP address of this okay 123 I just want to ask you one question like do you know about the uh IPv6 address if is then yeah please comment comment about this IP address about IPv6 address okay so okay finally I think we have reached to the destination with the number of hopes 14 okay yeah now now here you can see uh this is 142. 250 t.1 19246 it is the same IP address and the destination IP address is also the same okay so in this way uh we are getting uh like the number of different hopes like uh we started from 1 and 14 we reached to that our particular destination so this is the beauty of this command okay so I hope you like this because at the end we got all the like particular result like required result because it will show the like exact uh utility of this command like uh uh we are uh requesting for this and still again we are getting the same thing like we're getting the destination address as same as the IP address okay so that's all guys so if you have any qu then please ask now in this particular video we are going to learn about one of the most important command that is a MTR command okay so basically uh MTR command is nothing but uh like combination of the two commands which we have learned in our previous videos that is the Ping and the trace root command so now in this video we are going to learn about uh this and we will use like see the both the features of the Ping command and the trace root command in this particular single command Okay so let's start with the basic like uh what we have to uh write that is MTR and enter the then host name I will just go with the google.com and hit enter okay so here you can see like uh this is refreshing again and again and again okay so basically what's happening here you can see the you will get the percentage loss and all the what are the number of packets send what are the last received average based and all these things okay so basically What's Happening Here you here you can see the number of hops like from our what you can say from our source to the Des ation okay so there are approx 10 hops here in this case so uh like basically with this command you are getting the overall uh what you can say overall statistics and what happens in this particular command as you can see this page is refreshing again and again and again so we started from zero and now we are still at here you can see we are at 48 again 4950 so what is this happening this is basically nothing but uh the Ping request okay so here uh this command like what it does it sends ping request again and again and again so uh with ping request what we send we send the which protocol we use icmp like internet control message protocol we use okay so uh here you can see that again I will like uh run this command to stop this we have to just hit q and it will stop okay again let me check with the for another domain uh let's try for uh gmail.com no not Gmail uh let's try for facebook.com so here you can see here also we are getting our 10 hops so there is no any packet loss here in this case Okay so this is the again at 11 times that is 13 14 15 16 all these things you can see so to control the your what you can say ping request time like suppose you want to Ping again after after some some after some seconds like suppose you want to Ping after 2 seconds so how you can do it so for this we use a special function not function we will say just it is a just an option that is a hyph i option okay so let's uh use that MTR hyph I and we will specify the time for 2 second and uh for domain name let's go with the YouTube okay so here you can see now it's not like earlier like it's sending the Ping request after 2 seconds so you can see the like uh change in the frequency of sending packets okay so here you can see F4 now 7 now 8 so it's slow slower than earlier okay so in this way you can control the Ping request and here you can see the IP addresses of all the Hops which are which like between our from the source and destination okay so now moving forward uh suppose if you want to uh display only the what you can say only IP address not host names like actually we are getting here uh IP add but still there is a option of hyphn so we will use it let me clear the screen MTR hyphn and uh let's take some basic one uh our indan website uh let me search not brave let me open Chrome okay I will just search for let's search for blockchain so here okay here is the one website Investopedia okay or here is also blockchain.com is also one kind of website let's let me check it live yeah it's live okay we can find the IP and all what are the Hops present between this so let me go like this first blockchain.com okay accessible 104 okay okay now what I will do I will use the hyphen n option blockchain.com so here you can see only IP address as earlier also we were getting only IP address but so what happens in some cases we get the host names okay we get the host names in place of these IP addresses okay so these are basically your IP V4 address that is your 32bit addresses okay we will learn about more about in networking part okay about ipv4 address and IPv6 address okay so moving for forward in this uh uh video so we will go with one of the like uh option with in which we store the output in different different files like different formats you can say like we can store in XML we can store in Jon and also we can store in uh like other file format we can say uh I'm not getting what are the file formats let me check with uh okay so now here we will see uh what are the file formats so hyph B not this one local envirment packet okay CSV is also there okay here we can see if yeah here you can see iph iph XML is there we can use hyph iph XML for storing the output in uh like this okay so let me try with this hyph hyon XML google.com whether I will need to provide path or not I don't know okay contrl C to stop like 1 minute I will create One Directory uh CD blockchain and NTR iPhone iph XML google.com and now it will be sending like it's not displaying us here I will just h control CLS okay no files has been created uh hph o c. XML whether it's work or not okay it's not working uh let me check okay uh let's try with CSV okay it's not printing anything I don't know what's the problem here uh basically what happens it it displays the output in that particular format like if head is CS then comma separated values okay yeah okay we got it now so here you can see uh like this is the comma separated output in this case and if I will try with the XML uh actually uh file is not created the output is displayed in that particular format okay let's wait for two to 3 seconds I hope it will work let's wait okay so here you can see uh the output in the XML format nice okay so moving forward uh what I will do uh I will use some other function uh not function I will use some other uh options in which we can like uh create a one file in which we will add some domain names and then we will call that file and use this particular command what I'm just trying to say you uh let me create one file so just remember how you can create file in Linux we will just use Dutch command okay I will enter domain. dxt and I will write first google.com facebook.com instagram.com okay that's enough contr D to save okay let me check the content of this file not files. text what was the name domain yeah okay here is the domain uh now I will use MTR I will use hyphen f capital F option and provide the uh domain. txt and then the just it I think that's it okay so here you can see we are getting result for google.com Okay so you can see the Ping request everything we can see here all the statistics okay now further we will see how we can set the Ping okay so like uh normally what happens it sends approx 10 P request okay like 1 to 10 okay if we want for only five how we can do MTR hyph C5 google.com this is third fourth and the last one is fifth that's it so only five packets has been sent okay okay uh yeah again so here you can see this is a percentage loss here we can see the maximum percentage loss we don't know why and the sent okay wait a minute I have to just explain some things that's why so this is the last the average time this is the best time the what what time I'm trying to tell you like this is the round trip time like uh when the packet goes from the source to destination and then the packet uh like the rece sender receives the response from the receiver like that time that is a round trip time okay so this is the average best worst and this is the standard deviation okay latency something uh this is the last one so guys that's all for this video and I hope you liked it and if you have any query then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video now in this particular video we are going to learn about host command okay so basically this command is used for the DNS lookup it basically means you are going to find information about the DNS servers as well the IP addresses of a domain name or uh or domain name with IP address you can say so but before moving forward in this particular video you should know the basics of domain name server okay so this is basically one of the networking Concept in which uh we will learn okay the following topics like actually have written already one blog on DNS so you can go and learn from this infosec writeups and if you will search for all about DNS 100 days of hacking you will get it let me search it for you infos SEC writeups okay so this is the first one write up by awarma okay you can get it from here so uh let me tell you the basic idea of what is this domain name server and all these things so basically DNS stands for domain name server okay it means the whatever the your google.com it is a domain name it will get converted into the IP address or vice versa or IP address will get converted into the domain name so the main reason behind this is domain name service why this domain name server came in a role okay so just think like a normal human if you uh you are given a one address like 192.168 4235 whether uh this is easily remember easy to remember or google.com is easy to remember okay just think once so obviously you will say like sir google.com is easy to remember that's why that is the main reason behind this of DNS that's why it came in a role so we will see the basically working of how it basically Works uh let me move down as said you can see the I have WR like in more explanation I have given here you can learn it and also how it works I will tell you and this is a domain high like root level domain top level domain second level domain like do com. government do mil these are the root label domains okay and try hack me Google USA subdomains okay so you can learn all about these things and now let's moving forward to the working of uh this DNS okay so whenever user types in web address this particular domain name what happen in this case it will first do the DNS query from where DNS resolver okay DNS resolver is also one of the part of this particular process where some records are stored now next what will happen it will send the request to this root server whether if the dominium end with.com or do anything then it will move to the root server it will ask for do you have this IP address of this particular domain if it will say yes then it will forward the request then again in fourth step it will go with the TLD server and again with author name server and after that it will go to the main server of that particular website after getting the IP address okay so this is the overall working of this domain name server and now we will talk about the what are the records in DNS okay so basically DNS records provide the information about the particular domain so I will like go down and let me tell you the records okay so these are the basically some of the records like a records this four a records MX records CM record you can learn about these all things like a records provide us the ipv4 addresses and triaa and also one more a that is a 4 a record provide us the IP V6 address MX records provide us the like Mail Exchange address CM record is also provides like a like it points the subdomain to the main domain basically if there is a uh gmail. google.com or google.com both will point to the only single domain or not domain single IP addresses okay now moving this is the name server record that is NS records okay and TT record is some kind of record that that admin stored some kind of text and all these things okay now let's move to the our main motive of this particular video that is the host command okay so I hope you got to learn about all those things about DS records I hope it is visible to you let me just increase the size first so that it will be easy to it will be easily visible okay so now let's enter the host and just provide the google.com okay wait a minute okay uh let's see I'm getting some kind of error okay host google.com Okay google.com not found why like this post okay it's working okay let me provide another IP another domain name like uh let me provide Gmail not. go yeah do who gmail.com not found okay why this is happening I'm not getting let me do first ping whether it's working or not okay temporary failure in name resolution let me ping another some domum that is a uh which dominium should I let me check here medium.com let me do medium.com why it's happening I'm not getting uh let me uh restart my this Ubuntu machine so that after it may be uh work let me do okay now I have started restarting my PC uh let me now perform the that command okay so I hope it is visible to you uh let's do host google.com Okay so here you can see the address of google.com that is uh that is the ipv4 address what does ipv4 address mean it means that it is a like uh 32bit itus I guess okay if I'm not wrong uh let me check why to create confusion for you guys okay IP address bit size okay I hope it is 32 yeah I was correct okay it's 32 bits address it ranges from 0 to 20 0225 okay so here you can see the IP addresses of google.com that is 172.2 1727 .26 and again with the with same like you will get this IPv6 addresses that this is the like version 6 addresses of google.com and the mail server address that is SM SMTP now what will happen if you will think about the concept of DNS what is happening here is uh when you are entering google.com so that domain is mapped with this particular IP address this one uh let me copy this IP address and and uh let me put it here what will happen whether it will go onto the google.com or not let's check okay damn so here you can see that that IP address is mapped to the google.com that's why uh like we are going on this particular domain name what will happen if I will I will just change it 206 to 25 whether it will go to the same or different let's check okay it's going to the same because that whole IP address may be belonging to that particular google.com let me do two okay it's same okay so now uh let's go for some another domain also host uh let's go with medium.com like sometimes it happens like uh you can't go on a particular okay I press something like print okay when sometimes what happens when you enter the uh IP address of some of the domain then at that time you will not be able to reach that particular domain because of firewall implementation and all so here also you can see different IP addresses mail servers okay so let me check this one 153 do 4 okay let's check whether it goes or not okay so yeah here you can see the direct IP address not allowed why because I think they're using Cloud flare Cloud flare they using yes your IP here I will get my IP address okay so sometimes it doesn't allow okay now moving forward uh in this particular video with the getting the DNS records of a particular domain name okay so how you can get it like uh using Hy option we can get and also if you want to get only the IPv6 address you can get if it is available so here you can see connection is refused now let's check with the CM decord okay so if you don't know about CM decord you can go here and learn about it on this particular block okay what is see these record forward one domain or subdomain to another domain for example you can see blog. example.com has a CNM record with a value of example.com This Means whenever DNS record hits the DNS record for blog. example it actually triggers another DNS lookup to which domain that is the example domain and it basically Returns the IP of the same that is main domain example.com domain okay so uh let's do the DNS lookup for this particular record that is which one cm record so the command is very simple host hyph T cm and you have to just write any domain which you want let's do with google.com Okay it has no any record uh maybe it will be for medium let's check okay no records uh any website uh okay let me search for random colleges in Delhi if I get any college website now let's go with the 6.com copy it and just paste it here okay so here we are getting the okay not found okay okay so these sites are not having any CM record let's go with some another record uh let me check with MX record that is M ex it should be there yeah it has a mix record let's go for uh Google medium yeah they are using MX cord okay and let's check for another record that is a txt record okay we are getting it here all those records uh let's check for okay another website that is s hant txt record okay we getting all those information whatever the text is stored in this particular text file in the DNS course okay so I hope you like this particular video and uh today we will stop here and the next video we will learn about something new okay so that's all for today's video and if you have any query then please ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you hello guys now in this particular video we are going to cover the if config command basically it stands for interface configurator okay basically in this particular video we will be doing like changing the IP addresses and all those things and also this command basically we use is to find the IP address and the MAC address of particular machine so before starting what is a MAC address so Mac address is nothing but a particular 48 bit address which we use to identify a particular device on a particular Network okay so basically this Mac address is printed on your Nic that is the ni is a one of the card which attached to your to your computer or to your laptop then at this Mac address is like written hardcoded okay so let's start with our video so I will just hit uh if config so here you can see uh I'm getting different interfaces like EMP 03 and Local Host and at this point of time I'm getting this IP address this is provided by uh virtual box and this is the IPv6 address and this is the my Mac address okay so don't worry I've Chang it okay and this was interfaces for the Local Host okay so uh basically this uh command provides us what information you can see here the ipv4 address IPv6 and the MAC address okay so moving forward uh if you want to uh get the information of particular interface how you can do it if config and just write the interface name that is EMP 0 S3 okay here you can see the only uh like information about a single interface okay what is the interface just like uh suppose if you are connected to a VPN then another interface will be created okay so it just provides us the IP address of a particular Network in which through to which you are connected and all okay so moving forward uh if you want to change your IP address how you can do it so this command basically provides us this functionality also another command is IP Command which we will cover in our next video okay which which is similarly used for these purposes so first let's uh change the IP address of this particular command that is if config and the interface name but before I will need to copy this interface name okay so let me clear the screen if config if config uh interface name and then I will uh provide an IP address let's to 192.168 do uh uh dot uh 25.0 and net Marx we will provide like this uh determines the number of machines which will be there on the network okay operation permitted why because we have not used Pudo so to change these uh things we we need a Pudo permission okay I will enter just password I hope I type wrong password yeah now it should okay let me try it again yeah done now again I will check the IP address if if config and M here you can see the particular IP addresses and netm okay so that's all for this particular video and we'll meet in the next video with another most amazing command so if you have any query then please ask in the comment section guys so thank you and thank you for watching we'll meet in the next one hello guys now in this particular video we are going to learn about the IP Command okay so this is similar to the IP config if config command okay so in this particular video we are going to learn about this so let's me open up the terminal and let me just increase the font size okay I hope it is visible to you and the command is just IP and you have to provide just one option that is a or a this one double Dr okay so this will give you the IP addresses of each interface that is this is a local host and second one is my this one interface EMP 0 S3 and my Mac address is there which is provided by the which what we say virtual box and this one is the IP address okay so uh now moving forward uh if you want to get the on the ipv4 address so what can you type okay so IP hphone 4 and Just A Dr and here you go and now you have got the only ipv4 addresses not IPv6 but what if you want to get the ipv IPv6 address then what command you can do IP hyph 6 address okay so here you can see this is the uh IP V6 address it means IP version 6 address okay so basically there are the two types of addresses that is a IP version 4 and version six and there are some differences between them uh like um uh differences in you can say on basis of bit size okay you can learn more about the differences between ipv4 and IPv6 and moving forward uh let me tell you about one more uh this option that is a IP address so de and interface if you want to get only information about some particular interface so I will go with this EMP z s three and here you can see the only result from this interface particular 0 S3 let me clear the screen so that it will be more visible to you uh let me again run the command okay here you can see the interface is this one and here is the MAC address and the IP address okay so in this way you can get the IP address and Mac address of your system using this IP Command okay if you want to learn more you can just do man IP and here you will get the multiple options as you can see here hyph for human rable for hyph for stats so output more information if the cap option appears twice or more the amount of information increases okay so uh let me try hyph s IP hyph s let's see what happens okay uh what should I do now object equal to address okay uh let me check like this yeah here you can see we are getting now various records like many more information okay this is rx byes packet error drop missed any packet which is missed mcast so all these are showing here okay you with this option you can get more information again let's see some another option which we can use here here like um if you we let's use hyph R IP hyph R address okay so here you can see the information about uh dissolver name and 6 I virtual box 64 scop link this is okay so uh that's all for today's video guys I hope you liked it and if you have any query then please ask us in the comment section okay so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you hello guys this is aush and now in this particular video we are going to learn about the who is command okay so basically this is the command line utility of one of the GUI based tool that is who is lookup okay so basically we use this particular uh command to find the information about a particular domain name as for example google.com or the IP address okay so this is the basically command which we will use and and uh let's see what kind of information we can get about one particular domain name or particular IP address okay so first of all let me find the IP address of google.com Okay so here I'm getting this one I will just copy it how I can do it just uh control shift and c I will just now hit contrl C to to stop this ping command okay now who is okay so now you will see this command is not not found why not found because it's not installed in our system that's why it's not found okay so just copy it okay paste it this is the AP install who is this is a command to install any package you want okay let it install okay done done done yeah okay I think now it's done it will take some time just wait okay now done let me clear the screen let me again type who is okay yeah uh yeah I can do uh like I am able to learn run this command okay now so here you can see there are many flags available to use this command that is host Port I for query who is I and follows its referral okay so now what we will do let's hit this one who is and first let's check for DNS only like for domain names okay so now here you can see multiple information about this domain google.com let me clear this screen and again let me show you the whole information about google.com so here you can see the domain name is google.com their ID is this who which server is this their URL is this like from where they have registered or what register URL and updated date you can see it's 99 2019 expiry date is 4928 okay so name server is this one NS one. google.com ns2 and so on and moving forward and here you can see the creation date all those things okay and admin organization who is the admin of this particular domain that is Google LLC is the admin as we all know country us yeah we know it andtime we don't get this email because suppose you buy a domain name from go go id.com okay so they take some some fees to you to keep your information safe okay so no one should access those information like your mail ID your password uh not password your phone number and all those things okay so in this way you can get the information about uh any particular domain name okay now uh let me again check with uh with the IP address whether I'm able to perform this not let me just copy this IP address again oh wait okay yeah 142k 250 okay let me clear this screen who is and the particular IP address and we are done okay so here's the all the results so net range is this 142. 250 do not do not to this range okay okay so IP addresses can be between this CID is this sl5 so if you want to learn more about CID I have actually uh write a blog on it you can search for it like submitting infos writeups if you'll search then you will get okay then Google parent all these information you can get okay so basically where uh you will think about where uh you need this particular command what is the use of this basically if you go in the testing field or penetration test testing or cyber security fi and then there is a phase of information gathering so in this particular phase we use it okay so that's why I'm telling you okay so uh let me uh search for some more information like f is what are the things we can check here who is hyphen keyword description okay okay if you will use hyphen a to search for all the mirror databases brief iy addresses with abuse contact okay show the email addresses okay uh let me try with hyphen B okay let's check what happens who is hyb google.com okay here you can see we are getting some kind of uh email address okay uh let me again uh like uh use this command and I will not use hyphen B option so so that we can uh get the difference okay so what was the command I had entered here who is hyphen B okay now I will just use who is google.com Okay so here you can see uh I think we are not getting any uh mail address here but here you can see admin email okay but here I am getting one address that is brjb someone's address it is okay so in this way uh you can use uh different options uh okay so that's all for today's video I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then please ask us in the comment section we will surely help you and thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you thank you so much in this particular video we are going to learn about the NS lookup command okay so basically this command used to find the like information about the DNS records okay so previously in the host command we have find the DNS records and already we have covered what is the domain name server like it is used to change the uh domain name to the IP address and vice versa and also various DNS cords like uh CM record we have covered and txt record a record and for a record we have covered okay so many records we have covered till now and we will use this NS Lo command to uh get uh information about these particular records okay so let's start with the first basic one just start with google.com Okay let me close this caps lock and let's look up google.com Okay done here you can see the address that is this is ipv4 address and this this is IPv6 address okay so uh you can uh like what we say use this like this also you can use and look of hyph type equal to it means you are just defining the what type of record you want okay it may be a record okay let's search for a record iPhone type A and just provide the domain name and here you will get the address okay so in this you are getting this uh let me search for another domain name uh let's take some another domain name what should we take uh I'm not getting okay facebook.com okay so here you can see this is the particular IP address of facebook.com and this is for google.com so let me uh just uh copy this IP address and paste it in the browser whether we can access it or not let me just paste it here okay I think I not copied it okay just copy it and I will just open up the okay here I will paste it let's say whether it is accessible or not google.com with this IP address okay so it is accessible and similarly we will try for our this one facebook.com I don't think it will be accessible but still let's try okay it's showing not recommended I will accept the risk let's see what happens is I hope you have watched a scam okay okay so here you can see uh we are on this facebook.com page okay means we can uh go on this particular page using IP address okay so U moving forward uh if you want to get the record of like 4 a record like a a a a and a okay I hope I counted five okay so here will you can see the version 6 like IPv6 address of facebook.com now let's try some another record for another domain uh let me check for a record for some other another domain like I will now I will go for uh YouTube okay here you can see the IP address of YouTube I we know it may be accessible or not accessible using IP address okay that particular domain so now moving forward to the different records so we will search for the uh txt record okay let's search for txt hyph type equal to txt youtube.com Okay so here you can see this is the Google side verification some kind of text is stored okay and uh if I go with some different domain name like Facebook okay let's check okay these are the texts okay let's check for some another domain also I will just check for google.com okay here you can see different different like many texts are present there atlassian want domain verification okay many things are there and now moving forward let's check for the MX record that is the mail exchange record okay it it is basically we use it to like sending the mail or receiving the mail from from any sender okay so uh let's use it I will just uh change this from type to MX and this is you can see the mail exchange which is smtp.gmail.com for the small uh websites like let's take uh some let me search it search it for um I will open up Chrome here I think it this Firefox will take much time in this okay we are here just search for Linux commands Okay so let me take Java T Point okay yeah let me close this okay now I will use Java T point a record Java T point.com okay so here you can see this is the a record and here you can see two IP addresses are pointing to the same domain uh let me check I will just copy this IP address and I will put it in my browser let's check what happens whether it is accessible or not I don't know why it's not working of by directional copy paste is not here I think let me enable those setting yeah I think now it should work control shift C oh yeah now it's working okay so here you can see uh direct IP access is not allowed for javao let me check the another IP address it will be it will throw same error I think let's see what happens okay same same thing like direct IP access is not allowed so I hope you got it how you can find the different records using anx lookup commands so that's it for today's video and we'll meet in the next video with some amazing commands so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one thank you particular video we're going to learn about the most interesting command that is the W gate command Okay so basic basically we use this command to uh download files from the servers or from any website suppose in case if you want to download any kind of PNG or you want to download any kind of PDF or uh you can say uh also if you want to mirror the website it means you want to download the whole website their whole file that is HTML CSS JavaScript all those file if you want to download okay so in this case you can uh do all those operations using this single command that is a w command okay so uh let's start now with the implementation part that is uh W get and the whatever the URL you want okay I'm just first I will give you the syntax so syntax is nothing but WG options and whatever the URL uh you want to provide it can be uh URL of any file or anything else okay so now moving forward uh what are the protocols that W command supports so it supports St TP stps that is a Hyer text transfer protocol secure and FTP file transfer protocol so these are the some protocols which are used by the WG command so HTTP runs on Port 80 sttp runs on Port 443 and FTP on Port 21 okay now moving forward uh let me increase the font size for so that it should it go it should be visible to you guys okay now now what I will do I will uh try to search for image I have already searched I think okay so Linux PNG uh let me copy this image address or uh let me do here also I will choose this one image okay let's take let me check open image in new trap uh okay m yeah this one is good copy image address and here W get and the oh my god let's let's see what happens let's see just file name is too long okay so let's take some another image uh okay let me search for from here I will choose okay okay I think this one should be no not this one open image in new tab okay copy image address now let's check so here right now I'm not providing any kind of options so it will just store my file in this current working directory but before I will just create a One Directory W get tutorial I will create okay I will move into that particular directory and I will again enter the command that is WG and the this one link so here you can see it is downloading my file okay now we'll do LS and here you can see my file has been downloaded okay now to uh see the image file uh there is a separate command that is a fee but it is um you need to install first you can do like Pudo AP install fee I know I don't know the pronunciation of this command but it can it could be f f something like that so you can see f is already newest version so now what I will do I will just F and the file name what it was I think L something yeah so you can see file has been downloaded okay cool now you can easily download the files it can be used in some kind of automation things okay if you want but manually we download files from our web web browser but in some cases we could we can use W command also so now moving forward uh we will uh see the uh like uh what like here you can see uh the name of the file is so big okay if you want to uh like like name it some different names okay I will then for that we use capital O that is hyph capital O option and then we will use the new name that I will provide this Linux PNG image okay and the URL let's check okay I will do LS and here you can see Linux PNG image I am not added. PNG let me add it first okay do PNG oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry PNG done okay let me do LS and now I will use f Linux PNG not this one Linux image Linux what what is the name it is Linux PNG I M A yeah okay so here you can see uh we have changed the name of the uh like file this this like earlier it was a long string like theux Dux pen Vector graphic pixel Bay all those things but now we can easily change the name of that particular file okay so moving forward uh you can use the different options like hyphen P option to uh like uh save the file in a particular directory in which you want so I will go just move back one directory and uh no uh let me PWD I will do and I will just copy the whole path here first okay if I not copy uh doesn't matter let's now I'm in which directory I'm in this home iuse directory okay now what I will do I will just uh like like I want to save my file in this particular directory okay but before that I will just remove those files uh CDW get rone star okay it's not a star it's basically asri we say uh let me close this terminal now what do you want to do you have to just give the whole path of this particular like location so I will just provide this hyph p and this one and the link so I will just copy this one link okay done it should be yes so now I will move back into this directory W get I'll do LS and here you can see the same image okay we have downloaded so using hyph p option you can uh save your file into some another directory okay so now moving forward uh suppose uh there is some conditions like if you are downloading a multiple files or anything else and you have a limited bandwidth or limited internet connection or you can say limited net you have like these days we use 1.5 GB per days and all those things so in this case you want to limit your bandwidth or Internet like to like we we don't want to like w get to consume more amount of net okay so for this we use the uh hyphen hyphen limit hyphen rate option and we provide the what should be the minimum amount of the net used by this WG command so for this what we will do WG hyph iph limit hyph rate equal to 1 m 1 m means 1 MB 1 MB and K means KB and all okay and URL we will provide and let's now just uh use some different uh image not this one this one I was learning about how I can see the image okay this is not necessary okay move back move back uh let's download the SpiderMan Spiderman okay so this one is so like it's great image looking beautiful uh copy image address if I will do like it's uh unsplash image uh no I don't want this link let me open up this one open image and new tab okay uh if I will click on download free whether I will get some link or not if I will copy this one let's see what happens okay it's downloading now it means we have copied the correct link now what I will do I will just uh paste the URL and uh we are done and also I will provide the iPhone o option to change the file name iPhone capital O file name should be Spiderman PNG enter okay I'm getting some kind of error let me do contrl c LS something C get log let's see what's going on okay saving spiderman. PNG okay let me again run the program uh you can use hyphen C option to uh what we can say to resume uh hyphen C I think it's uh uh small C let me check and again I will just open up some another terminal to check the W get log file if I get the same error again CD W get URL LS and tail hyph F log okay and let me just again run this command okay redirecting output to W get hyphen log. one okay let me just contrl C and W get one it is I think LS uh to at do one okay connecting to oneplace.com so here you can see we can see the live uh whatever the background process is going on you we can see this like this using tail command Okay so w get command W get log basically provides a log okay whatever it's going on okay so I don't think it is getting connected I'm getting some kind of error maybe it could be network error let me just close the connection I will use some different uh different image not from unpl okay Wikipedia is there uh let me open image in new tab I need a short link just okay just search for Linux only okay this one let me check let me close all these sides okay let's move back I think it's taking so much time open image new time no Linux PNG okay it's still opening man how much time it will take uh let me pause the video uh okay so I was getting a network error at that time uh now it has been resolved so here you can see uh like the log file of this one wg. log. one okay so you can see the file is already fully retrived okay so uh now I will just check again so here you can see the image I think it's too large to display here okay that's why we are not able to see it so in this case if you want to limit your bandwidth you can use the limit hyph hyph uh hyph limit hyph rate equal to whatever the uh amount you want to give like uh it could be 1 MB 1 KB or anything it's all depends upon you and your internet connection and similarly using Hy C we just checked we can resume any uh like uh any download which is not complete or if uh like similarly I just got the network error so I can resume using hyph C option okay uh now moving forward uh if you want to download some file in the background process okay so in that time we use the hyphen B option that is this one hyphen B option we will use and uh also the WG log file will be created similarly like this like uh this one WG log and WG log. one okay similarly this file will be generated and we can see the whatever the process going on and all those things so now moving forward I will just download one PDF I will just search for us uh file type this is Linux uh Google docking we call it if you use this kind of searches uh file type I will just type uh let's type Linux PDF I hope my connection internet should work okay again I'm getting it I don't let me pause the video okay now I'm done uh now finally it's working let me just search for a file type I will just use a let's just SE similar like this file type PDF uh colon I just let me write the file name also so that it could be easy so so here you can see there is one PDF file introduction to Linux this one okay TLD dp.org this is some kind of I don't know which website is I will just copy this one move back to our terminal just LS remove everything whatever we have uh downloaded till now okay RM hphone RF forcefully we removed everything clear the screen also W get hyphen B and the particular link or URL you can say so now in this case what will happen the log file will be created okay so I will just enter and what it's saying continuing in background p is this output will be written to W gate hyphen log okay LS I will just use tail hph fwg and here you can see all done we have finally downloaded this one I think let me do LS and let me go into the file section file system open Wate tutorial okay here you can see the file so in the background process what happens uh the file all the process whatever going on is getting stored in this WG hyphen lock file okay I hope it is clear to you so here you can see all the process like this is like how much bits of data and all those things the IP address from where it is resolving it is connected on which Port that is 443 that is the https uh and saving which file that is intro to linux. PDF file is saving okay so I hope that is clear to you it should be clear to you okay so moving forward let me just close on this clear this screen and now we will uh move forward and we will uh if you want to download some multiple files suppose uh your boss give you a task and give you the links and he's saying you download one by one one by one but uh you know the feature of this WG command you can download multiple files easily so how you can do it let's do cat let me I will just create one file that is cat uh books. txt okay and I will just hit the first link and let me go for for second one okay this one it should work let's check Okay Internet bro yeah working finally okay second file um okay done we will just save only this one file control control D to save okay now done let me check the first text whether it is correct or not yeah clear and LS I will just uh remove all those files RM RF now there is nothing else so which option we use to download multiple files you use WG hyph I and the file name but where is file name let me oh I just deleted the file name also no problem let me create again control shift V and here also uh this one yeah crl C okay just paste it here control D to save now we are done clear WG hyph I book. txt hyph I okay resolving this one connecting to this particular website fetching Linux for beginners fetching Andro inol linux. PDF file okay so in this case you can down multiple files let me check with ls command and yeah done here you can see both the files has been downloaded finally okay so these are some of the features which we learned about till now okay so now in the next video we will see the the most interesting part of this W get command which will be covered in our next video so till now we will stop here and thank you thank you for watching and if you have any qu then please ask us in the comment section guys thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one hello now in this particular video we are going to learn about the how we can miror a particular website or download a particular website you can say like that also so using WG command so already we have covered the first part of WG command and now in this particular video we will just mirror the website okay so what are the things we will be doing in this particular video so first of all we will miror the website and secondly we will just locally host the website using python okay and already the python installed in our one to PC okay this machine so these are the two things we will perform and let's start the implementation part so we will we will use the disate command and the some of the options the common option is use hyphen M but it is not suitable to browse that downloaded website locally so additionally we use some other options that is hyphen K and hyphen P option also to browse those website locally in a easy way okay and it downloads the website in a particular format you can SCT that okay so I have already selected this particular website you you can see uh this is a quite a good website and this is nothing but a free template from I've have got this from this html. design/ demo SL bird uh bird I am okay so you can uh do this uh you can also download this template or also any other okay so I'll just copy the URL and I will just paste it here and but before that uh uh wait a minute I'll just close it uh I will just create One Directory uh mirror website okay CD mirror website okay and now here I will use those particular this one command okay so now it will fetch all the HTML Pages CSS all the images it is fetching and here you can see contact. HTML images just bird lion deer Dove anything whatever is the images and all those things it is fetching so it will take AO I think uh it should take 3 to 4 minutes of time as uh website is not quite uh long like it should not take much time okay so here you can see it has faced multiple files you can see multiple images of images directory and here you can see it is fetching left Arrow blue all those images it is fetching okay xmlrpc.php okay it's present here in this particular website I think this is wased on WordPress okay okay okay okay I can see this WP content plugin Json oh okay let it be I thought it is HTML page so that uh it will take appro 2 to 3 minutes of time but it is uh okay no problem uh let me search from another website Del which is an HTML not in WordPress I will just uh add one extension that is used basically used to find the what on which technology the website has been built M extensions uh walizer okay caps lock is on walizer okay look up website extension I have to search extension for Chrome okay Let's uh check so you can see it is downloading all those files and everything else add to Chrome ADD extension so basically this extension is used to uh check on what technology your website is built on it could be what press it could be stml CS it could be rectangular okay okay 10 now let me check I will also search for only HTML templates free download okay uh now super car okay this one is simple let me select this one tshirt design okay so I will just search okay why this is not again it's still checking let me check the source code okay section ID script control U there WordPress is there not no WordPress is not okay this is based on the HTML CSS okay okay installation is successful okay uh yeah here you can see okay I will just reload this page okay so here you can see wiu YouTube bootstrap is is used in this particular website okay here it's still fing it will take much time because it's based on what that's why cancelled it okay uh CD html. design okay here you can see multiple folders and all those things okay uh okay it's still let me try with uh just I will serve this web page let's check what happens what are the files has been uh downloaded and all those things I will just copy this link and open the this Firefox okay it's opening let's wait okay so I'll just paste it and uh okay it's opening download free HTML template something is uh coming up here okay okay so it has downloaded the whole website I think okay okay okay I don't want the whole website let me close this window first okay we will for download the this uh tshirt design website I will just remove this whole okay clear LS now nothing extensions I don't want like this okay so it is just uh like we can see uh if we are passing one particular like another directory then it is downloading from the all those particular things like uh it if I will provide this link then it will start from this mobile r.com extensions and all those things okay let's again try uh what was the command okay okay let's wait it's I think so fast okay okay let's I will just pause the video and wait for the completion okay okay it has finally uh downloaded everything now I will do LS CD mobirise.com LS and here you can see extensions it is there I will CD dot do/ LS so mobilize.com uh One Directory has been created and that extensions is there so CD extensions and here all the files should be there like tool M5 is also One Directory we saw we are sure that uh okay tshirt design so here you can see the extensions to M5 tshirt design and then the index. HTML file will be there okay I will do LS and no I will do tshirt design LS and here you can see index. HML assets so uh let me move back to the directories okay CD do do slash dot dot dot dot dot dot slash LS okay again no I think I'm in Mirror mob.com okay now we just the python server uh HTTP server okay so just copy this link open up this Firefox okay the website we had chosen earlier like uh it was a very Ed website based on the WordPress that's why it was taking much time so it is a simple website that's why it got completed in a very less time okay so in mov rise okay directory listing let's go in mov r.com in extensions in tool M5 in tshirt design and here we go okay done so this is the website locally okay you can see all the same design same color everything is there okay now you can if you want to uh like uh edit this website you can easily do okay so there also another method to mirror a website but it was related to W get that's why I told you about this particular feature I will go to about us uh yeah it's working I think okay now it is not linked I think about is not linked okay okay no problem so in this way you can mirror a particular website I hope you liked it and you can like match the things like everything is similar okay so in this way you can mirror a particular website if you want so I hope you liked it and that's all for today's video I and we will meet in the next video with some another another amazing command so guys if you have any queries so please ask in the comment sections and thank you for watching we'll meet in the next one thank you thank you so much particular video we are going to learn about the SS command okay so basically this command we use to connect to the remote machines or if you're not aware of remote machine then let me tell you first what is a remote machine so basically this is the concept of cloud computing in which uh when you use a machine this is just like a similar machine but we access it remotely okay that will be the similar machine like your PC and the same operating system will be there okay and it will be Linux or it can be Windows OS okay so basically that particular instance or that particular machine is stored in the data center of different Cloud providers if you are using AWS then Amazon Amazon data center will be there if you're using Azo then U Microsoft cloud data center will be there and in case of Google then Google uh data center will be there okay so basically what we are going to perform in this particular video so first of all I will create a virtual machine in Azure you can also do it because it's free and using sandbox you can uh like you get 1 hour exess of the Azure portal so you can go on this particular link or you can just search for create a VM using Azure portal then you will get this link and you will just need to login using your Microsoft account so I'll just activate sandbox it will take some time just wait for it okay but uh uh let me tell you first like uh SSH command so what port it uses so basically SSS command uses port number 22 okay so now this processes uh going on and in this particular this article you can learn about how you can create a the virtual machine also if you're interested okay so now 91 92 yeah okay and you have to just go there and click on this as your portal okay okay now here this here is the Azure portal you can easily uh create virtual machines in this just click on this virtual machine okay so I will just click on it and you have to just uh click on create as your virtual machine okay so here you can see the resource code you have to select just this learn and virtual machine name I will just use Linux VM and this is the open to server we are going to use in our case this is a image it means which operating system you are going to use so here you can see choose the base operating system or applicate applicable for the VM so we already it is selected that is UB to server you can also select different OS like uh windows and all for Windows we use RDP okay so now here you can see uh if you are going with s s public key then it will create a PM file but right now we are not going with it we are going uh with a simple way that that is a password so I will just provide a password that is aush and I will provide a username okay okay matching now s s such Port is there you can enable HTTP also it's all your choice okay now next and here you don't have to do any kind of changes no changes you have to do okay so you can directly just click on review plus create okay so basically the main purpose of this video is to show just show you the working of SSH command Okay so one uh this my scine is deployed and I can show you easily okay so here you can see validation pass it means you have done all the things correctly you have to just click on create here okay initializing deployment let's wait it will take approx I think 2 to 3 minutes of time and basically this video will be the first part and our next part we will cover some different things in SSH like how we can share files and all those things okay deployment is in progress let's wait okay it's going on here you can see the all the steps or whatever it is uh performing okay like Linux IP VM NSG okay it will take approx 2 minute of time now yeah yeah Linux VM is now it is getting created let's wait okay you can skip this part in the video like you can fast forward word now it's done just uh one confirmation should come yeah your deployment is complete uh you have to just click on this go to Resource okay yeah uh let's wait asent is not ready why not ready troubleshoot the issue okay okay I'm not getting why it's not ready let me just click on this VM extension issues no issue found okay okay no issue found uh let me just uh uh yeah IP address is visible to me I hope now I can uh do so here you can see the IP address of this Linux VM machine and I know the my username and password so I will use this SSH command okay and uh SSH and the username is whatever iush at theate and the IP which you have copied enter okay so here it asking are you sure you want to continue yeah I'm absolutely Dam sure click on yes okay so we have to just type the password I hope I entered correct password okay done so here you can see iuse Linux VM is the username and uh is the host name of that PC or ubu machine and this is aush okay so you can see this is not my Ubuntu machine okay you can clear the screen if I to LS so here it is nothing okay so if I will just uh create one file uh let me create uh cat test.txt uh leave I will not create one file let me just install all the one Apachi server in this sudo AP uh get install Apachi 2 so it is basically a web server we use to host web application so okay so just click uh hit enter okay why it's not working I don't know why it's not working let's check I will just close this terminal again I will connect uh I hope that connection has been lost okay SSH the username and the IP okay IP is not getting printed let's me check what is the IP here this one okay not I don't want HTTP something like that just remove all those things enter okay the password okay so now I'm this machine I'll just install Apache server Apache 2 hit enter yeah do you want to continue yes click on yes now here you can see the Apache server is uh installing this is not my Linux machine like you will think like this is my Ubuntu machine okay so Apachi 2 is getting okay okay uh after uh creating the server you will see the default page of apachi okay we are done and I will just reload okay so automatically here you can see the Apachi server uh default page is displaying okay so uh let me change this uh like I will just change the permission of one folder that is uh not 70077 and the folder is war www HTML basically this is the directory where your index. HTML file is stored I use sudo now okay and now let's move back into those directories I will just use CD do do slash LS again CD do do SL LS I will move into the war www HTML okay now we do LS here you will see there is nothing I will just create index. HTML and I will okay permission denied I will use sudo okay again it's permission is denied okay lsph L CH mode 77 operation not permitted let's use Pudo okay now I can edit this index.html file okay I will use this body and the H1 tag I will use this is is a tutorial based on SSH by aush okay and just close this body tag control D to save and just reload this page okay so you are done here you can see this is tutorial based on SSH by I so I hope you um got to learn about different things in this particular video like how you can create VMS in uh Azure Azure okay and also how you can uh uh install Apache server in your remote machine and the most important thing SSH command how you can connect so in our next video we will use different commands to uh we will see how we can upload files from our uh like this local machine to this machine but sorry sorry uh but we will use uh like different server okay like tomorrow we will use E2 server of Amazon okay but because uh this machine will get uh like uh out of network in 1 hour okay not in even 1 hour it will take uh approx 35 minutes will be remaining okay 42 minute okay so thank you guys for watching this video and I hope you liked it and got to learn about new things so we will meet in the next video so byebye and we'll meet in next one thank you for watching hello guys now in this particular video we're going to learn about the SCP command okay so basically this command is used to copy the files from one host to the another host that is uh in our previous video uh we had created the virtual machine and today we will work on that particular thing so basically in this video we will create one virtual machine and we will uh share the file or move file from this machine from this ubu machine to that particular remote machine okay so we will do this with the SCP command so let's start the video all first of all we will need to create a virtual machine so on this particular URL you can go like learn microsoft.com and uh intro to Azure virtual machine then you here you will get the sandbox and you will get the access of 1 hour of azure portal so you don't need to pay any amount of money for creating v machine or anything okay so we'll wait for some time uh it will just take hardly 10 second now okay let's wait 9 2 93 4 okay 100 okay so here you can see 59 minutes so it's basically we get access for 1 hour so now come down and just click on this as your portal now here you will get the interface and uh maybe uh you will need to sign in with your Microsoft account then and only then you will get the access okay it's taking some time let's wait okay here we go now here you will see the virtual machine you have to just click on it virtual machine and uh you will need to just go on Create and click on this as your virtual machine sometime yeah here you have to just select your resource Group and virtual machine name I will just uh use this name Linux VM and the usern name and password so I will write the username as iush and the password I will write sorry okay again enter the password okay password match so here SSS 2022 Port is allowed so basically SCP command runs on this particular Port by default okay so uh next you will do but here you don't have to change any kind of settings and all it will be def by default it will be same okay we don't need to change anything okay here we go now what do you have to do you have to just click on review plus create it will take uh approx 1 minute of time uh okay till now I pause the video okay guys so here you can see the validation is passed or now we have to just click on this create button so it will just create a virtual machine and we will get the public IP address of that particular machine and we will use that particular IP address to connect with this machine and uh whatever the username and password we have provided while creating this virtual machine we will uh use that one to connect to this particular remote host so let's wait for some time it will just hardly take a two to 3 minutes of time okay so deployment is in progress let's wait okay so till now uh till then I just uh give you the overview of what is the SCP command so already I have told you like this command is used to like U copy the file from one host to remote host so here basically this machine is my uh physical host physical machine machine you can say and the Machine to which I will connect like this virtual machine that will be the my remote host so I will use this command to share file from this machine to another machine so there are also some many of options we use for fast transfer for getting information while transferring we will use all those particular functions so here you can see the deployment is complete now we have to just click on go to Resource and we will get the particular public IP address and uh here it will show yeah here here is the public IP address first of all what I will do I will just uh uh try to connect to that particular machine using the credential which we had provided in while creation I hope the terminal visible to you just uh SSH and whatever the username I and the IP address okay so you have just write yes it will uh uh permission denied public okay I don't let me just close the terminal and again I will open up SSH iush at theate IP address okay password it's asking me for password hit enter okay now I hope I have entered correct address uh password okay okay so now here you can see the uh whatever the host name we had added like Linux VM and the I the username okay so if I will do uh clear the screen and I will write who am I so here you can see the uh username is aush and uh also you can see this host name has been changed from Linux VM uh from I to Linux VM I think let me again open up one terminal and here you can see aush virtual box is there okay so this one is my remote machine I just add one comment here remote machine and I will just provide the IP address okay so this is the like comment we use hash for writing the comment in this Linux terminal now moving forward another the use of the SCP command comes here if we we have a file suppose I have to just create one file let me create one file with the name of CAD test.txt and I will just uh not test I will write some another cat remote file. dxt and I will write something like this file is being sent from iuse physical machine contr D to save now we have to use the SCP command so basically SCP what it stands for it basically stands for secure copy so you will send the file using uh Port like 2022 it basically by default it uses Port 2022 and also our this machine accepts only port number 22 no other port number it accepts the if request is coming from coming for the some other port number uh other than 2022 then in that case it will not reply back to that particular host okay so now what we have to do uh I will just uh let me do LS so here you can see the remote file. text is there and let me just clear this screen and SCP I will use and I will use hyphone capital c for the faster transfer and the file name that is a remote file.txt and the username I will also need to provide here iush add I at the rate and the control shift V and I will need to provide the location where we want to just uh what we say store that file so I will store this file at this particular location home iush and 251 and I will just need to use this colon and uh sorry okay sorry sorry I just uh I will need to again write the command so so here I have to just uh use slom I okay so here what will happen basically uh this remote file.txt will get transferred from this machine to this machine like copy will be transferred so let me just hit enter and it will ask me to enter the password and I will just enter the password okay done so here you can see 100% so 0.2 kb per second was the speed and uh let me clear the screen and I will do LS so here you can see the remote file.txt has been uh like copied into this particular remote host okay uh like uh let me uh just send another file also let me create a.txt this is aush okay control D to save again I will use the same command just change the file name file name to aush now hit enter again maybe hope it will ask me to enter the password but let's see yeah I will need to enter the password that is Kumar atate 098 HH hit enter and uh the file will get copied into that particular location okay it's taking time I don't know why okay yeah done so I will do again LS here so here you can see i. txt has been copied now I will just try to read the content of this particular file okay so I think the connection is slow that's why it's lagging okay sorry Ive used wrong I have to read this okay okay let me just remove this okay yeah now just hit enter so basically it has overwritten with the like nothing we had written so by this command basically the text was over written no problem let me just read the another file we have also transferred another file that is the remote file.txt we can read this okay so here you can see this file is being sent from I physical machine the same text which we had written in this particular physical machine okay so in this way we can transfer the files from one machine to another machine and also by default the CP uses AES 128 uh encryption method to encrypt files while uh while translate you can say but if you have to use some another method then you can use the hyph C Small option also if you if you want to use some some different port number uh like if you will need to use then hyph capital P option okay but by default this machine is accepting only the port number 2022 so if I will use some another port number then in that case it will not uh what we say it will not accept the request so if I will do hyphone Port 234 and I will just try to uh I will remove remove the files from this machine okay it's uh like running slow I don't know maybe it's reason behind is slow connection it may be so I will just remove the i. txt file here okay sorry I you should there yeah so now file has been removed and now I have used the hyphen p234 and I will use hyphen Capital C option and just hit enter so in this in this case you will get like uh it will not accept the request like uh it will not display anything nothing will happen Okay to solve this issue we will need to use just hyph V option also hyph is small V that is just used for getting the default information okay hopefully we will get get not connecting to this port number yeah because port number is not open that port number is not open in this machine that's why so if I will use uh just port number 2022 and we have used the wrong command also hyphen P 2022 hyphen C Small hyphen V and now hit enter and here you got the all the information so now you have have to just enter the password but ever again you will see the information like connecting to this particular IP address on Port 20202 enter the password so done next okay sending command sending file modes i t 300% 15 compress outgoing raw data this compress to this so while trans Transit what happens whatever the amount of whatever the size of your file will get compressed and then again it will whenever we it will reach to the remote machine it will uh like um stored in the original form so again if I do LS here so you will get the i. txt file okay so uh now let's do with uh different port number let's see what happens to actually total port number in network we use are approx 65,535 are the total port numbers I've just tell it told about this for your information only so here you will see connecting to this uh particular IP and the port then you can see the port and after this nothing will happen because uh this machine is not uh accepting any port number other than Port 2022 so it will not happen anything it will go in the infinite Loop you can say and but like we just need to hit contrl C so basically in this way you can use the SCP command to share files from one machine to another machine remotely or or also you can say like the two remote machines are there then then only then you can use this particular command so that's all for the today's video and I hope you liked it if you have any queries then you can ask us in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next one thank you hello guys now in this particular video we are going to cover about the most important command that is the uptime command okay so uh this is a very simple command and it will not take much time so let me introduce you first with what is this and so basically uptime is a command which is basically we use to find the how long the server is running okay so let's start with the implementation part so I will just hit up time oh sorry it's up time and here you can see it's 1851 51 that is 6 51 and up since uh 34 Minute like from right now it's 651 as you can see it's 652 right now and now it's running till uh 34 Minute and number of user who are logged in that is only one user is logged in and this is the average load you can see okay so to get output uh in a very uh easy way to in understandable way as this is there are multiple things here like Uh current time up time okay users okay so but before that let me increase the font size I forgot to increase okay so I can use different options uh you can use hph to see what are the options available so here you can see hyphen P it will show up time in pretty format so let's use this and let's check whether output comes in pretty format or not so up time hyph P we are done okay so the server is running from uh it's running since 35 minutes okay uh let's use another option we will use hyph S so it's uh the time at that time was 617 okay now it's 653 okay so and you can check the version of this uptime command using hyphen V okay this is something uh 3. do 17 okay so I hope you liked it guys this video so as this command is basically useful when you go in a corporate and you need to fetch some server up time whether the servers is running or not okay so in that case you can use this basically command Okay so that's just for today's video and I will meet you in the next one thank you thank you for watching now in this video we are going to learn about the most interesting command that is a uname command okay so basically this command you use to get the information about your machine okay so basically we will use this command to get the information about this Ubuntu machine so we will basically start with this and we will use some of the flags or you can say options with this uh uh un command to get the host name to get the kernel whatever the kernel is being used in this particular machine what is the name of the kernel and also you will get multiple information like operating system Hardware platform information machine information everything you will get to know in this particular video so uh let's start with the implementation part so here un name if you provide without any option if you will execute this command you will just get the uh like name of the kernel name you will get okay so here you can see uh as we already know like in the installation video we have saw like the ubu is based on the Linux kernel so that's why it is showing the Linux so but before starting uh uh the like going deep into the video I want to just uh give you the overview of what is the Linux kernel okay so a lenux kernel basically you can say as the core of the operating system okay if there is an operating system the kernel will be the core of that operating system B why because it creates an interface you can say or creates a connection between your Hardware hardware and your software okay so basically uh kernel has all the control of your operating system if kernel fails then whole operating system will get failed you can say like that also so I hope that is basic information is clear to you and we will see about ker release what is Kernel release so uh let me tell you about the kernel release so kernel release is nothing but whenever a new version is released of a kernel like if there is suppose version is suppose 5.0.1 you can say like that then uh again new version is create uh released that is 5.0.2 so why this new version and why this new kernel release has been done because if there is some vulnerability or any bugs in the first colel then that bug will get patched and then again new release will be done okay new current release will be done okay so that is the concept basically current release so now we will see the uh CER release so for this we basically use the hyph r option so here you can see the now currently version current release version of this machine is this 5.15 40 one generic okay so in this way you can get the CER release information now moving forward uh let me just show you this uh Linux like kernel name you can use hyph S option also to get the uh kernel name okay so uh like both will give you the same result like un name and unim high furnace uh okay and uh now next moving forward uh if you want to get the uh host name of your computer like host name is like that name which is used over the network you can say like that so if you you will do un name hyphen and then obviously you will get the host name as in my case this is aush virtual box is the host name and again uh next if you want to get information about your machine about your processor then you can use hyphen M for your machine you name hyphen M for your machine so like it is 64bit you can say you can see here it is and uh next if you want to get information about your processor then it's also easily you can get using iPhone P option so same information is being displayed here like it is the basically the architecture okay so now next moving forward uh if you want to get the hardware platform all those thing you will get the same I think yeah Hardware platform is the same 64bit and to get the name of the operating system so obviously it is uh J Linux so Linux operating system it is open to so now again uh like uh there is also one uh super command you can say like super option that is hyph a option which basically gives you all the result of these like you you don't need to write this all to get if release you you you don't need to uh write hyph r hyph s hyph and anything you can use a simple command that is a un name hyph a hit enter and here you will get the all the information like Linux is the Kel name this is the host name this is the version and this is the uh what you can say I think this is uh your uh version name it maybe yeah it should be version name like #p yeah it's a colel version name it is and next is the date of creation or installation and next is your all the architect processor architecture everything you can see and the and at the last you can see the name of the operating system so I hope you liked it guys that was a very uh basic tutorial so that's all for today's video and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section so thank you for watching and we'll meet in the next video thank you thank you so much now in this video we are going to learn about the another command uh that is the host name command okay so basically host name command is be used to get the information about your what is the host name like this name and uh how you can change the name also with the help of host command you will get the uh IP address okay so we will start with the implementation part so let me increase the first uh font size so hope it is visible to you so now what we have to do we have to just write the host name so it will basically give you the whatever the host name of your computer that is this one I virtual box okay so also you can uh like uh what we say change the host name and also you can get the IP address using different options if I will use hyphen I then it will give me this Local Host IP address and but if you will use the capital I then in that case you will get the actual IP address and whatever the IP address will be present in your system so in this case we have only one IP address and now moving forward uh the interesting part of this particular video is that uh you can change the uh host name also so how you can do it it totally uh there are basically two methods and you should be like uh run this command as a root okay like in my case this iush user is like in the sudos file and we can easily change using this particular command so how you can do it uh you have to just uh use this particular Pudo host name and uh host name and then what we have to do you have to just give the uh different name okay I will give this one actually this is my Instagram page username uh you can follow if you want so I think I enter wrong password let me erase now iush okay so a specified host name is invalid because we have used underscore so underscores are not allow I will just remove it underscores and hit enter and now I will again open up the one terminal new terminal and here you can see the host name has been changed from aush virtual box to this one xaby okay so but now what I want I want to uh like keep my host name as it is so I will just copy this one and what I will do I will just again uh run this command I use this and now in this case you will get that is same at same as pre previous one okay so moving forward uh if you want to uh change this host name in some kind of different method so how you can do it it's uh it is very uh unique thing you can say like you will you will use the one file I will create one file that is uh let's create with the host name. txt and I will write the host name as let me write uh uh let's write same thing exite and contr D to save and now what we have to do uh you have to just use this command that is the sud sudo host name and capital F and the file name which we have created that is host name. txt and uh now again I will open up the new terminal and here you can see the host name has been changed from Ice virtual box to exite again so in this way you can change the host name also very easily now moving forward uh if you talk about the like fq that is a fully qualified domain name that is basically domain name for a specific computer or a host on the internet you can see like that so how you find it using this only one option that is hyphen f so this is the now my actual host name so in this case you can get the fqdn also if you want to learn more about it you can just Google it what is what are fqdn so uh first now let me again change my host name to the previous one this one yeah now it changed so yeah done so uh I hope you like this particular video and if you have any queries if you have any doubt then please ask us in the comment section so that's all for today's video we will stop here and I will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you for watching and we'll meet you next one thank you guys byebye now in this video we are going to to learn about the password command okay so basically uh this command is basically we used to change the password of any user or if you want to add uh like password expiration days or anything you want to perform with the password any kind of operation like uh if you want to delete the password you want to make account password L then this command is used okay so we will basically start with the user creation like we will first of all add a user and then we will perform that operation on that particular user so I'm adding one user here only one or two names allowed okay I'm just giving the name as uh password user here new password it asking me for I will give the new password okay no required these information yes okay clear now first of all what I will do I first uh log into that user password user and I will just enter the password and yeah here you can see I'm logged in into that particular user and now I will just exit because I want to use my account okay so let's start with the uh password command okay so now what we have to do you the command is basically used with the Pudo why because only the root user or whatever the user who is present in the sud file that that can only change the password or the current user if you uh do like this sudo and only password it will what it will do it will change the password of your current account that is my account that is a and it will ask me for the new password okay but I don't want to uh change my password okay so uh for a minute let's change okay so here you can see password updated successfully but again I want to keep my old password so I will write that password okay password did successfully okay so now moving forward what you can do if you want to change the password of any other account that is a root account then also you can change that how you can do it that is sud sudo password that is pass WD not a full password it's a pass WD and then the user account name that is root so here you can change the password password updated successfully now what you can do you can just log in with that credential using Su that is switch user command and here you will need to just uh okay so now here you can just enter the password of the root user and you will get the access of the root account okay so with this you can change the password of any other user and also you can do many operations okay so now what we will do we will just uh uh change the password of the the user which we had created now so let me just close this terminal and uh I will just copy this username because it's so long username I had Tak no problem just sud sudo password and the name of the user that is a password user and enter and the new password I will provide him just uh okay password updated successfully so now what I will do I will just open up the new terminal and I will log in with that new password I know the password is not visible because the this is the feature of the Linux like you cannot see the password like it's a great thing okay password user user user okay it's not coming okay now door okay yeah so here you can see you have we have logged in with this particular account so now let's uh do some certain operations like now what I will do I will just close up this terminal and uh I will just use some uh some options like high friendly option now we will use so basically what happen this option deletes the password and make the account password list okay so if we do like this password hyph D and the username that is a password user and here I have to use sud sudo so password expiry information changed okay now what I will do I will just again open up the new terminal and I will try to log in and I will check whether it asks me for entering the password or not so here you can see it is not asking me to enter any password as you can see the password user uh like is logged in now if I will do here who am I here it will show me the password user so using hyund the option you can just make any account passwordless so suppose uh if you want to create a guest account for the like any user who want to use the system and you will just give him them give him that certain uh permissions like not you will not provide him the root permission and you can create a account passwordless the guest account can could be passwordless uh let it be okay it will not affect your system or the administrator so in this way you can just create a passwordless account now moving forward uh let me try to just add the password let me check what happens if I do PSE sudo password password user and H ask asking me to enter the new password I am again entering and now I will just exit here and again I will try to just switch into that account and now it should ask me to enter the password and here you can see it's asking me to enter the password and now here you can see I have logged in as the password user okay so in this way you can add the password remove the password or you can log into that account using terminal using switch user command so many information you got till now okay now moving forward uh suppose if you want to like immediately change the password if you suppose if you will use hyphen e option let me clear the screen first I will use Soo password hyphen e option if you you will use hyph e option so what it option does it basically uh like prompt the user to change your password after login okay so let me show you just uh the implementation part I will just use that username password user password expiry changed and again I will exit and again I will try to just log in with this user sorry password user and I will just enter the password and it will ask me to you are required to change your password immediately administrator enforce like as I admin I just enforce that particular user to change your password immediately okay you got it like Suppose there is a uh like organization in which the admin want to change the like like admin wants like uh their user should change their password immediately okay so he can just uh add multiple users and then it will enforce them to change their password immediately okay so it ask me to enter the current password and the new password I will write the password is sorter than eight correctors so I have to enter the password which is longer than eight correctors okay the password fa the dictionary check it doesn't contain enough character okay no problem so but uh you got the point I just didn't use the strong password that's why it's showing like this but in case of you if you will enter the combination of the zero and one and makeig capital letter small letters characters then that will make the basically a strong password okay so now moving forward I hope you got this point okay but still let it be I will just let me show you the implementation otherwise you will think like uh I didn't uh showed you the implementation but again let me just do the same thing and I will just log in that user I will enter the password and current password it is asking me current password I will just enter the password some long password I will enter okay so it's not showing any kind of air right now so sorry again I will need to do the same thing again there is some type mistake it should not done yeah okay finally we change the password okay now I you do who am I and you can see like I'm logged in as the password user okay so using hyph option you can just force the particular user to change their password immediately after login okay so now U moving forward uh if you want to add the like some number of days like uh minimum number of days required to change the password suppose you create a user and um like uh Suppose there a there is a organization and there is a intern okay intern comes in organization comes in organization to do internship so obviously you will provide him he will work for some kind of 90 days or 120 days or any number of days he will work so obviously you will create their account and you want to automatically expire their account after certain period of time or or you want to change his password after certain period of time okay there are many number of requirements you can do so to do these kind of things we use the minimum days okay mean days option so it means we cannot just change the password before 100 days if you provide 100 in uh in a option okay suppose the intern you don't want to change the password of intern uh till his journey suppose he starting from 0o to uh 50 days if there is intention of 50 days and you don't want to change the and you don't want to like in turn to change his password in this case you can use easily uh hyphen M as option so let me use this option like it's a great thing uh I will use this password and hyph M days I will use M days and the number of days I just I'm assuming the 50 and uh username password user I think it was the username yeah okay so there is a invited option it is showing me uh okay is there any okay there is no any option with hyphen M okay let me just try with hyph iph mindus maybe it should work let's see okay it's showing me permission deny and why it's so just clear the screen I have not used sudo here that's why it's showing me permission Den so sudo and password expired information change and now what I will do I will just not exit I will just clear the screen and now I'm logged in as a password user and I will try to change my password so whether I'm able to change or not let's see because I have changed the permission of like I cannot change my password like uh till 50 days okay changing password for password user okay but now let me just close this session because this is a like uh you can say old session I will create a new session and then I will try to change the password sudo sorry Su password user and the password what it was yeah I forgot yeah let me just increase the font size I will just enter this password and I will write Uh current password okay so here you can see you must wait longer to change your password okay so this is a uh like great feature like you cannot change your password before 50 days okay similarly you can use the max days option it will just uh like uh suppose if you provide 100 days then after that what will happen your password will expire and U you will need to obviously change that password and okay so what we will do we will just contrl C okay it's not working control C I don't know why let me just type like this okay password unchanged now what I will do I will just uh use Max St option so what it will do it will just uh like your password will get expired after this number of days so I will just leave it uh as 100 pass expiry chain and uh you your password will expire after 100 days okay and also you can use another option that is one day option password hyph iPhone one days so it will warn you to change your password before expiry okay so permission denied you know the reason because we have not used sudo here expiry changed okay so this is the way to manipulate with the uh password command okay and also one more thing is there like inactive is also one option which we can use to deactivate account suppose after 10 days of expiration uh your password expires and and still you don't change the password and in that case your account will get deactivated okay and also one more option is there that is password hyph capital S and sud sudo and I will just provide a username hope it will work yeah so here it will show the some of the information like uh you can see the date the today's date is 39 IP just shows the uh like uh account is locked or unlocked and here the date shows the uh creation of the password and the 50 is the minimum days and 100 is the maximum days as we got to know and 10 is the warning days you can see here okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section and and please just give me the feedback in the comment section like how is the videos going on and are you getting or not and also you can uh ask me if you have any doubt on Instagram you can just uh you can just uh follow this page that is xaby I know the name is little bit difficult uh tricky you can just search asore 3xa yt3 uncore okay you can ask me doubt here also so that's all for today guys and we'll meet you in the next one so thank you and we will meet in next one byebye now in this video we are going to learn about the CH as command okay so basically this is similar command uh just we learned about in previous that is password command but in this we cannot change the password okay so we will start with the basic options and basic implementation of this command so that is CHS and using hunel you can get the information of a password of any account but before moving forward for we will need to create a password uh sorry not password a user sud sudo not user I will use add user and I will name that user as a xaby okay so I will just use like this xab BYT XA okay password nothing nothing nothing nothing why okay clear the screen now just ch age and provide hyphen L as option and the user name that is a xaby okay permission denied okay no problem we will just use the Pudo and we will get the permission is that easy yes okay so here you can see the the last password change is that 7 uh like 30 September it means today's date and password expires never never nothing is added account expires nothing is added minimum number of days between password change is zero uh by default and by default maximum is 999 it's uh like it takes the date from 1970 I think that's why it's showing that number of days and warning warning is this like if your password get like uh uh n9th after before 7 days of this completion you will get a warning okay so now uh let's move and I will use this uh we will use the maximum number of days like we will use hyphen M option to change the maximum number of days like this one so how we can do it CH is hyphen capital M I will just use 100 and the username that is uh this one and permission denied again because we have not used sudo let me use too and done and we will just clear the screen and just call that function and here on that command and here you can see the maximum number of days between password change is 100 now similarly you can just uh add the minimum number of days also what it will do like it will just uh you cannot change your password uh before that particular days whatever you specify in minimum days so you can do it it's simple just instead of capital M you will need to use hyph M and you can use here the number of day that is 50 like till 50 days you cannot change your password again let me show the information and here you can see the 50 days like minimum number of days between password change is 50 moving forward if you will provide a minus one option then what will happen let's see with maximum number of days it will remove that uh it will not check for that validation hyphen M and if I will provide minus one and and I will again check and here you can see minus one it will like it will not check for the maximum number of days if you will use minus one but I don't want to use minus one I will simply use the 100 to keep things simple okay moving forward if you will use uh zero in a small M like in minimum number of days it means the user can change the password anytime but if you but if you use some kind of number here then user can can change that password after that number of days if I use zero then user can change the password anytime if he wants okay that is the main use of zero and but I will use 50 here okay now moving forward uh if you want to add the expiry date in your password like your password should expired after that certain number of days okay so how you can do it if I will use like this Pudo let me just yeah sud sudo hyph capital E and I will use the format as year 2022 uh 10 and 01 and the username okay and tomorrow my password will get expired and here you can see account expire expire uh it's on October 1 20202 okay but password uh last password change this and password will expire when in January 2022 yeah it's a little bit like illogical thing but yes you can understand because we have not I have just used this expiry date like uh normally okay so moving forward if you want to use the warning like uh Suppose there are 100 days after 100 pass will get expired but you want to war the user before 7 days then in that case you can use hyphen W option hyph W and suppose you want to war the user before 10 days and uh here we got an error this is capital W set expiration warning days to warn days okay okay sudo hyen W1 yeah now done and here you can see number of days that is 10 as we provided here okay so in this way you can uh change the expiry date minimum days of required to change the password password validation warning days you can do all the things with this particular command and also you can do same things with password command also but yeah if you don't want to change the password then you can use this command normally like you don't need need to change the password again and again using password command okay so you have basically two commands to do this same thing that is password and this one what it was CHS okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it if you have any queries you can ask in the comment section and we will meet you in the next video so thank you thank you for watching now in this video we're going to learn about the basic command that is NL command okay so basically this is a very simple command okay but sometimes it useful for Linux administrators in some cases okay so we will see the one uh use case and but before that we will create one file let me give the name as names.txt I will write some names here aush and ainos and uh Harry and uh I will write Ron and again let's take some another name that is uh um am okay I will re use contr D to save and now I just read this file names. txt but in this case you can see like there is no numbering here okay but sometimes we need to just get numbering like if you suppose this is a code uh if there is a code file and you need some numbering in that then we use this NL command to get the numbers so here you can see see that 1 2 3 4 5 is listed here okay so suppose if I create another file that is index. X HTML I write like body and I will write this H1 hello world and I'll just close the body contr D to save I will just read the file C index.html and you can see this we are able to read but now I want the line number of this file like of this code sometimes what happens uh like uh we get some kind of error in a particular line of code so in this case it is useful to like debug that error I will use this NL and I will just provide the name of the file what was it index.html and here you can see there 1 2 3 line number okay so I hope you got the what is the what will be the what can be the use of this NL command but yeah it's very simple so that's all for today's video guys and we will meet you in the next video uh with some amazing commands so that's all for today video and we'll meet you next one thank you thank you for watching we'll meet you in the next video thank you now in this video we are going to learn about the process in Linux Operating System case so basically in this video we're going to cover multiple things about the process what is the process what are the types of proc what is the P ID and basically we will surely learn about the basic concept of PS command we will just take an overview but in detail we will make a separate video about this on PS command Okay so let's start with the process if you are a cc student and if you are a operating system student also then I hope you are aware of process but if not then I'm here for you guys okay so let's start so what is the process so the basic and simple definition of process is execution of a program okay so now what many of you will ask me what is a program s so program is nothing but uh bu like whatever you write in a CPP code or a python code or a Java code that is a program and whenever you execute that program it becomes one of the process but uh if you take a real life example of a process here here you will see many apps are there if I will open Firefox that will become one of the process if I open this thunderboard that will become one of the process if you will open files that will become one of the process okay so as for definition process nothing but a execution of a program when you are executing any program then you are simply creating one process in your operating system okay now moving forward what is a p ID so p is nothing but uh you can say it like as a process ID it is created by the created by Machine by Linux machine and which what it does which uniquely identifies the process Suppose there are multiple processes going on in this Lance operating system so to identify each and every process there are a unique ID like if you are aware of the primary key of dbms so it's similar like that it unly identify each and every process okay or if you will get a real life example of account number so more than uh one account number cannot be associated with the two different people okay so similarly P also works like it uniquely identifies the particular process and also in Linux there are basically the we learn about the two types of processes mainly that is uh one is foreground okay and the second one is the background process so as a name suggest you might have guessed like what is the foreground and what is the background so foreground means whatever the process which are by the user so that is the forr if I will do here uh what I can do I can just do p this is one of the process if I will do who am I it is uh sorry who am I it is one of the process so whatever the user is entering the command or opening any kind of application or anything happen that is a example of the foreground process and now if you will talk about the background process then in this case uh what happens the operating system has multiple person which runs on the background as for example if you'll take an example of the Microsoft Word Ms word so in this what happen whatever you write in uh like in a what we say in a word then if uh any mistake happens spelling mistake then what happens in that case like uh it displays as the yeah this is your spelling mistake it like shows in color so how how is is it possible it's possible as the background process running on to check the spelling mistake you might have might happen Okay so this is the concept of the background process okay so in Linux we basically we can also create the background browser using uh I think some kind of ENT I think we use ENT to use the background process so yeah here you can see the 2 12510 P ID has has been created for this to create to do who Ami as the background process to stop this you can hit just control Z or contrl C contrl C okay so if I will do FS command so it will display me the foram process I think not FS I will need to like uh install this command FS or FB it is I'm not remembering like we will cover this all those command and all those in our next video FP is there maybe no not it's not there FP is not there uh let me remember the what is the concept what are the command for the checking for process yeah so FG is the commander to get the foreground process so here like no job is it is showing no job okay so if I do bz so bz also there is no background process going on as per this operating system so also we will learn about the some of the command like in the next lecture that is the PS command with which displays of the process State okay so right now it is displaying with the two like what we say two processes so let me first clear the screen and surely we will learn in detail about what is the PTY Time same in our next lecture but let me just show you the example of the foreground process so if I will open of this Firefox right let me just split the screen and I will just not Firefox I will open this uh let me open Firefox so right now currently it's showing me like this processor but for more you can check psone e okay so here you can see now Firefox is displaying here like 12 630 if I will close Okay and again I will check whether it is displaying me or not I will just check with it PSI fun okay so here you can see there is no Firefox but when I will open up so Firefox process will get added and it will display me the P ID of that Firefox so now again I just clear this screen and I will again I will enter this PSI so here you can see like now different p is being used for the Firefox now to stop this process you can use kill command also so kill command and the P ID that is the one 365 and now done so your fire FOC is Clos now so that's all about yeah guys about the process I hope you like it particular video and surely in our next lecture we will get to learn about the for forr how to get foreground background and the PS command okay so we will learn all about these three commands and the process States in our next lecture so thank you guys for watching this particular video and I hope you liked it and if you have any query then you can ask us in the comment section thank you guys and we'll meet you in the next one thank you hello guys now in this particular video we're going to learn about the PS command okay so basically what is a PS command why we use it we will discuss each and everything in this particular video okay so what is this PS but before that me just increase the font size now I hope it is visible so PS is nothing but uh process State what does it mean it basically means it just gives us the information about state of any process okay it we will get the P ID of a number name of the command who is the user using that particular process so we will get each and every information about the process but before starting and going into the deep Insight of this topic uh you should know what is a process process nothing but a execution of program when I open this Firefox it will become one of the process when I will hit this particular thing it will become one of the process I know it is like any command but still if I will open any this music rhythm box then it will become of the process process is nothing but the execution of a program okay so now let's uh play with this PS command so when you will enter the PS it basically gives you the uh like status of this current shell what are the processes running in this particular uh cell like this is one of the cell if I will open another window of terminal it will give me another shell okay so here you can see we are just getting this PS the command which entered just and this is the bash is one of the like you can say a shell which acts like a parent uh uh process like some other process use this bash to execute some kind of uh their task okay so now let's basically talk about what are these four types of uh like what is this like P TTY okay so let's start with the p ID okay so what is a p is nothing but the process ID what does it mean it basically gives us you the unique identification number of a process like uh uh let me tell you the example of suppose in a family member uh each and everyone will have the different name okay not like uh two person will have the same name in a group of like family of of two to not two five to six members okay similarly this p is there like process ID it uniquely identifies each and every process in this operating system okay it just gives you the particular number of four digit and all so I hope that is clear to you what is a process ID now moving forward that is TTI is nothing but a terminal type it gives you the information about the what type ofal is being used by the user let me just write uh terminal type and yeah if you are just watching this video so don't just keep watching uh make notes also so that will be helpful for you for your further use now this is a time is nothing but the CPU utilization time by the process so here it is zero because no any other process using this bash shell or bash command okay so this is CPU utilization thing okay now moving forward the CMD is nothing but the command which is used by like what commands have been applied for this particular process okay so I hope it is clear to you like what is p TTY time CMD okay now moving forward now you will be thinking about why there is only two processors displaying because it PS by default displays the current uh process in a current shell okay so to get more information for the different processes like on a boot time there are multiple processor runs like on booting of system so let me just uh enter this PS I from a so here you can see there are the multiple processes you can see like what other the commands has been used like uh system D SCSI paide okay this one colored so there are many processes here you can see in this particular like screen so here you can see the PS command is also there like the P 6203 okay but yeah one more thing is that like if the PS command fures the result from this particular directory P here if you do LS then here you will get the information about the particular thing okay so uh in this particular directory you can see many files are there like like like it basically fetches the particular information from this particular directory okay now wait just move it on to the RO directory now moving forward uh suppose I just uh create one process okay let me just create one process but before that I want to tell you one command that is one option that is PS Hy C Discount basically option what basically it does it basically uh like gives the information about the particular process which you want okay in case if you want to get information about the particular process uh then you can hit the name of that particular process here suppose I need the information about the Firefox okay which is now it's not running so I can get this so now what I will do I will just first clear this screen and I will open up this particular Firefox so now what will happen when I will click on this Firefox one process is getting created and then the P ID is given to that particular process and you will see that in this like uh now in a seconds okay so let's wait now you can see the this Firefox has been started now I will use this PS hyphen C and the name of the person that is the Firefox so here you can see like from 10 seconds it is utilizing the CPU and the PID is given and the command is using like Firefox okay like you will say like you not use this command but yeah let me show you if I will hit into Firefox the Firefox again the one terminal Firefox will start okay it's say fail to load yeah but some module is fit but it's still here you can see one Firefox window has been appeared if I just close it okay so that uh this is the first one okay so in this way you can see the information about the particular process uh and if let me just enter one more command if I will hit here cat and it is now in the weight State like it is just what we can say asking for the user input whatever I will write and anything okay it is just waiting for the user input so I can use this command also yeah like I will write your cat and here you can see the PID is assigned to this particular process okay so now what I will do uh if I want to just uh kill any process I want to just uh whatever you can say discard any kind any process then I can use the kill command and I will just give pass the parameter as this P ID so I will just enter this P 739 and then here you will see like uh let's see what happens so here you can see terminated the cat is now terminated and similarly you can do for this uh what you can say for Firefox also but before that uh let me just uh use hyphen a option to again view the all the processes so when I will clear not I will clear this just do PS hyph a and here you can see uh what is the P 6214 let me check whether it is visible or not yeah here you can see the 62 6214 p is generated okay what if I will kill this 6214 what will happen the Firefox window will get closed okay so you can see now again I will use PS I so here you can see there is no 6214 and also no there is web content uh like what you can say web content command or any process is not displaying here as you can see in the previous command here let me just move back here you can see the web content process was also there so in this what has happened the 6214 P was the parent process and under this process there are many other processes like here you can see the web extensions web content and all those things okay so in this way we can uh use this PS command to get the process of uh any particular uh application or any command okay now moving forward about another option that is the PS hyph U okay so what this basically it will do what uh this Con do so hyphen new option is B basically used to giving the like you want to get information over the some particular user so if I use I I will get this information so these are the process which are being used by my command not by my command sorry uh by me actually I is one of the user of this operating system if I use R hyph you root so you can see the uh these are some processor which are being used by the root user okay so also there are uh one more option that is the Au option PS command which is used for uh getting detailed information about the processes so PS hyph Au just plays the result in more detailed format okay so here you can see the name of the user is uh like display like whatever user is using this particular command this particular process and the virtual memory utilization TTY terminal type stat start when the process started so here you can see the 549 at 549 actually I had started my the system so it is displaying like on Bo time this process has been started so you can see all the information but now here you can see at 61 this process and now at 659 this command was done was uh used okay so in this way you can get the detailed information about uh your process okay also you can use psyph a to get the running processes so here you can see these are the running processes okay uh okay yeah this is the time command start okay so that's all for today's videoos guide I hope you liked it and it was a very uh interesting thing like to get the like what are the processes being used in your operating system if you learn more about this you will get to learn also more like um when you will explore personally then obviously you will get to learn more about this so that's all for this video and we'll meet you in the next one with another interesting command uh okay so maybe I will create video on top command after this so let make in the next one so thank you for watching byebye now in this video we're going to learn about the top command Okay so before starting this video first of all let me tell you about the what is the top command okay so if you have learned about the PS command like which gives us the process States of uh like of all this system similarly top command is also one of the command which lies under the process management okay we can get the uh information about the different processes like what is the p that particular process how much memory is being used by that process okay we will see all the details and what are the users and what the users using that particular process so everything we're going to see about in this particular video so we will start with the simple and basic command that is a top simple when you hit Top then it will show you the details about the other running different running processes by different users and all those things okay uh but before that let me just increase the size of my terminal I hope this ible to you I'll just hit Top okay so here you can see the P ID the what P ID what does it mean I will tell you everything about the all these three what is these all things okay but before that I will need to separate like this the screen and I will just open one command line also okay so here you can see what is the P ID P just Define the process ID like uh if you don't know about P let me tell you like like like uh every device has a unique Mac address similarly p is just like that like it is it uniquely identifies each processes whatever the process is created by the user then the our system assigns some P to that particular process to uniquely identify that process similar that is the process ID okay moving forward if you will see the user so user section just defines like who is the user using that particular process uh don't give attention on spelling M Stakes okay that is not important here right now so what is PR PR is just uh like priority okay what is the priority of that command so the thing is that if the your what we say the number is lower so it should have the higher priority you can see the zero so these processors have should have higher priority okay like you can see 20us 51 so it is you can see 2020 everything is there like so here you can write the lower the number higher the priority what does priority mean basically like this process like for if something happens to the more priority command or more priority process then the CPU users should like not CP uses just think like example Suppose there are two processes A and B and B the priority of B is low but priority of a is high okay if some Interruption happens with it then then a can use more CPU uses you can say like that okay so this is the defines the P like what is the prity of that particular process of command and for the you will see here it is V which basically defines the virtual memory used by the task okay it is I think it's in KB it is in KB okay so that's why it's showing like bigger number okay so it is virtually you can say not virtually virtual memory used by the task okay moving forward what is this rest so rest is uh what we can say I think it is the physical RAM yeah the command used like whatever the process is running like how much RAM this is particular using like this particular process how much RAM it is using so also in the KB this data is in KB okay and uh moving forward if you will talk about the shr so shr is nothing but a shared memory it also in KB okay and then the percentage CPU percentage memory time and what are the other option you can see here uh where it is time plus command all those things like this is this uh this show the uh which command uh like after entering which command this process is running okay so here you can see all those things okay if I will just uh yeah wait a minute what I will do first I will just stop this stop command and I will again run that top command and I will show you one thing okay so here you can see the top command is running okay like different processes coming here and there okay now what I will do uh but command is not visible let me just string create this one yeah yeah now you can see the command is visible if I do Control Alt T and I will hit this F Fox Okay so this command what it will do it will just create a new process okay and then again you can see here if I will hit enter in this particular terminal then Firefox will come up there and some P will be assigned to that so here you can see which command is this Firefox and the particular time you can see how much CPU uses per memory plus virtual memory okay and RAM also and who is the user I is the user and the P ID is 4790 okay so in this way this particular top Comm Works which dis play you the particular information about any particular process okay so now what we have to do uh if you want to just uh what you can see uh you can say like if you want to get information about the particular user like uh some let's suppose I want to get information about the I user what process is being used by that particular user so I can use those command also okay but before moving to that uh I will just tell you one thing like if you want to kill any process while using top command how you can do it you have to just in this particular terminal uh let me just increase this one okay uh where it is uh I think this one yeah this one Firefox is running Firefox p is what 4790 now what do you have to just hit K so when you will enter K so here you can see p to Signal default P ID is 1622 so here you can do uh like enter the PID of the process which you want to kill or which you want to close so if I will search for fir Fox I think it was 4790 okay so let me just Saed this okay uh yeah here you can see 4790 is some Pro is let me just increase this one the width of it so 4790 I'm not able to see 479 here you can see 4790 is this one so I'll just hit K and I will write enter 4790 enter and here you can see the what happen when you kill the command um not command when you kill the process then you need to give the particular signal so in this i h 15 so you can see like Firefox has been closed and also here you can see the terminated okay so why I entered the p uh 15 because like it's kind of signal which we use with the kill command okay so we will talk about the kill command in some another particular video okay now moving forward what I was telling about to get information about the posst used by some particular user so how you can see you uh like how you can do that what we have to do you have to just enter top hyphen U and the name of the user I and D here you can see all the processors which are being used by this particular user oh I think multiple processor being used okay so in this way you can get information about particular user if you want to like if you work in a corporate world and you get like as a un administrator then in that case it will be very useful like to know like which user is using what kind of processes when something happens then you can see okay and also there are multiple things like uh you can if you will hit Z then the running process color will get converted into this what we what red color and if you will do press uh like what you can say if you press C then you will get the path of particular command like for which in which path that command is particular running so here you can see The genome cell is in user bin directory and many more things here it is okay so that's all for today's videos guys I hope you liked it and if you have any quer then you can ask in the comment section so thank you thank you for watching and I will meet you in the next video thank you now in this video we're going to learn about the kill command Okay so already we have covered the PS command and the top command okay so in this video we are going to learn about how we can kill a particular process or you can see the how we can terminate a particular process process sometimes what happens in our case like you open a Firefox or any application and it becomes unresponsive okay and at that time you cannot access that application and you cannot use that particular application so in that case you need to just uh you want to just terminate that process or close that application anyhow okay so for that purpose we can use the kill command and also you can normally you can also use that Kil command okay to close any application or toate that particular process so how you can do it so there is a separate command in our Linux system that is a kill okay so kill is the command you can use okay so there are the many signals provided by this particular command you can get those signal using the kill hyphen L option so here it will list all the signals which you can use but mostly used signal is the 15 this one signal terminate and also you can use the signal kill signal kill okay so these are the signal which are used mostly by the kill command to kill particular process so to demonstrate you I will just uh uh open up the Firefox using this terminal I will hit P Firefox and Firefox will start and I will just enter the PS and PS hyph a to show all the process so here you will see the Firefox P ID that is 8796 okay so I have got the PID of Firefox okay so with the help of PID I can dominate this particular process soid is 8796 okay so but there is many ways to terminate particular process you can just terminate that process using the PID as well using that signal and the name of that like signal term signal kill and also without signal so I will just show you each and everything okay so you can just do kill that is p ID is 8796 okay using PID or you can just do hyphone 15 okay that is 8796 so what it will do it will just skill that particular process that you can see the terminated Okay so also you can do how you can do it but now I will not open the uh Firefox I will just use cat command cat home okay and I will just use PSAT to check the p is 9405 okay so here I can use kill hyph SI signal and I will use Tom and I will just enter the p number that is a 945 and hit enter and you can see the that particular uh process terminated and also you can do like this also like SI without SI you can also use this command so I will again use this one and I will first check the what is the process of cat because process ID changes again and again that is 9417 this time and I will use 9417 and you can see the process terminated okay so in this way you can use the kill command okay now uh now let's use some another signal also so if I will use PS hyph L uh not PS sorry kill hyl so I will use this one uh kill so let me check how it works I will use this kill Hy 9 and the process name that is the cat no not process name p ID so 94 431 K Hy 9 9431 hit enter and here you can see the process is killed okay so in this way you can use this kill command to terminate any process or kill any process so if that process is unresponsive or that any application is unresponsive so in that case you can use this particular command Okay so that's all for the today video guys and I hope you likeed and if you have any queries you can ask us in the comment section okay so I meet in the next video thank you thank you for watching
