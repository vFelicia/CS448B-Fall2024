With timestamps:

00:00 - now before starting I would like to tell
00:02 - you what all we will do
00:06 - what we would be looking in this series
00:08 - would be
00:10 - ready
00:12 - okay yeah
00:15 - okay we're looking at HTML
00:18 - CSS we'll be looking at
00:21 - JavaScript and we would be looking at
00:25 - real ideas
00:27 - we'll be looking at node.js and we've
00:30 - been looking at
00:32 - Expressions okay
00:36 - so and values
00:39 - we also you can get mongodb
00:43 - okay
00:44 - oh yeah this is all what we are going to
00:48 - do we are going to be adding here okay
00:51 - hmm
00:52 - no you might be wondering what all these
00:56 - are like what did I just you know say
00:58 - okay
00:59 - so we don't have to worry much about it
01:03 - foreign
01:15 - and as soon as you hit react these are
01:19 - basically
01:21 - uh you know essential languages and
01:24 - framework to learn
01:26 - front and web depth okay
01:30 - good
01:31 - now what does front-end exactly means
01:33 - front end regularly means what you see
01:36 - on the web
01:37 - okay
01:39 - I mean whatever you see on the web that
01:41 - is fantastic and node.js XPS and mongodb
01:45 - these you know compressors are backend
01:49 - okay
01:53 - cool
01:55 - okay let me just you know complete it
01:58 - back kick
02:00 - okay now this is what you know you
02:03 - submit a form or you know
02:05 - uh
02:07 - like if you look at Amazon
02:10 - you submit a purchase or you know you
02:12 - buy something then
02:14 - how that detail is tracked the details
02:17 - thread using putting all these things
02:19 - foreign
02:26 - so now let's start with the very first
02:29 - lecture yes okay now we will learn how
02:32 - you know web works exactly
02:35 - okay so
02:38 - um let us ask you what is internet so
02:41 - [Music]
02:44 - the very basic definition is
02:48 - internet is Network
02:55 - network of
02:58 - Network okay
03:02 - now what does this exactly means it
03:05 - means that
03:09 - um I have this box okay
03:13 - I have this another box
03:16 - I have this another box
03:18 - and I have this another box
03:21 - these boxes are exactly called servers
03:25 - okay
03:26 - and these you know contain different uh
03:31 - what do I say
03:36 - [Music]
03:36 - um
03:38 - web pages or you can see the websites
03:41 - all right and all these are you know
03:43 - interconnected
03:45 - just need to to there just need to do
03:48 - this this might be connected to this
03:50 - this might be connected to this
03:52 - might be connected to this and this
03:54 - might be getting ready to do this like
03:56 - this
03:57 - so this whole web
04:00 - this is called internet it is basically
04:04 - network of it
04:06 - okay
04:07 - I hope this was clear to you okay
04:11 - now next second question to you is
04:15 - how exactly
04:18 - do you
04:19 - uh access Internet okay this is a very
04:24 - basic version I mean everyone has access
04:25 - internet I mean you've seen this thing
04:28 - on YouTube so that means you have an
04:30 - access internet and
04:31 - okay
04:35 - so internet is you know basically
04:37 - accessed
04:39 - using
04:41 - web
04:42 - browsers okay now my wondering what is a
04:46 - web browser right
04:48 - so I guess you might be having
04:53 - Chrome on your website or you know
04:55 - Safari or brainwash anything like that
04:57 - these are called web browsers Chrome
05:02 - Safari
05:04 - wave
05:06 - and even fireworks
05:09 - eight
05:10 - these are called web browsers we have
05:14 - you basically you know go to the
05:18 - um
05:20 - and you access the internet over here
05:23 - right
05:25 - see here I am using uh Google Chrome
05:29 - so that is my web browser how
05:32 - View
05:39 - actually internet okay
05:42 - now
05:43 - what is you know a web page where you go
05:48 - to Chrome you open a website you come
05:50 - across a web page okay
05:52 - so
05:53 - what is a web page now that is my next
05:57 - question
05:58 - now if we talk about what a web page is
06:02 - our webpage is nothing but just HTML
06:07 - CSS
06:09 - and
06:11 - JavaScript code
06:14 - which is
06:16 - rendered okay
06:19 - understood I mean you write some code of
06:23 - htmlcs and JavaScript somewhere
06:26 - not somewhere on your IDE right and this
06:29 - code is basically
06:30 - rendered and that is how what I mean the
06:34 - rendering part is what you see on your
06:36 - web page okay good
06:40 - now uh if you have little basic idea you
06:43 - would be named what these three are used
06:45 - for
06:47 - so HTML is basically used for
06:49 - structuring over a thread okay
06:53 - it gives us a like it is a skeleton
06:56 - over that page okay
06:59 - this is used for notification
07:03 - now to add colors to add font and
07:07 - to align objects that is why CFS is used
07:12 - foreign
07:18 - what happens suppose if you click a
07:20 - button what would happen there would be
07:23 - some alert okay
07:24 - and if you hover over something like if
07:27 - I over here
07:29 - see uh something is written there like
07:32 - 10 black thickness three
07:34 - so this is all I got how JavaScript like
07:39 - this is all done by JavaScript okay
07:41 - now see you cannot use CSS alone okay if
07:45 - the I mean it is very obvious right you
07:49 - know to use JavaScript alone as well I
07:51 - mean
07:52 - that is also very obviously
07:55 - but you can use HTML always alone
08:00 - right
08:01 - cool
08:02 - so HTML is a building block of a web
08:05 - page
08:06 - now
08:08 - so in this tutorial we would start with
08:11 - HTML again
08:13 - you know go what is HTML and you look at
08:17 - some of the web pages then you would
08:19 - understand about HTML tags and
08:24 - you know deformed and everything and in
08:26 - the end of the build and HTML uh website
08:30 - a simple HTML website as a project okay
08:35 - so first of all before
08:40 - we dive deep into HTML code I will
08:46 - want you guys to
08:48 - um
08:49 - see what HTML so HTML basically stands
08:52 - for hypertext
08:54 - markup
08:57 - language okay
09:01 - so what you understand by this thing I
09:04 - have a text
09:07 - these are like Fortune support and what
09:09 - to do with them okay
09:12 - so you would break this thing into two
09:14 - parts and that's how you would be able
09:17 - to
09:18 - uh what do I say
09:20 - understand it better okay cool
09:22 - so first what is hypertext that second
09:25 - one is
09:29 - cool
09:31 - so
09:34 - um what is hypertext
09:37 - okay
09:39 - we would understand what hypertext is
09:42 - actually right
09:44 - so
09:45 - let's open a web browser and look at
09:48 - this website
09:50 - and if you don't know what this is so
09:53 - this is the first website ever created
09:56 - okay
09:59 - all right so it was just a worldwide web
10:02 - info and everything
10:03 - you can see these things subjectively
10:06 - like
10:08 - uh in the blue color
10:11 - these are basically hypertexts all right
10:13 - I mean if I click on any of these
10:16 - because I click here I will be
10:18 - redirected to some other page if I click
10:20 - here I will be redirected to some other
10:22 - page right click here I would be
10:24 - redirected to
10:26 - other page
10:27 - yeah yes okay
10:31 - so basically
10:33 - interlinking
10:38 - as well
10:41 - okay
10:45 - I mean these are very old that's right
10:47 - so
10:48 - in the name of it may not work but okay
10:52 - whatever like you understood uh what I'm
10:55 - trying to say
10:57 - right
10:58 - yeah let's go yeah okay everything is
11:01 - okay
11:02 - so see these are hypertext basically if
11:04 - we click on any of them you will be
11:06 - redirected to some other web page
11:08 - so this is called hypertext okay
11:13 - I hope you understood what it's a
11:15 - hypertext rate
11:17 - now the other thing comes is markup
11:20 - language whatever markup language
11:23 - now uh in the
11:26 - um
11:27 - OLED uh era what used to happen was
11:32 - the book printers like this was a book
11:35 - okay
11:37 - and there was text written by authors
11:40 - like and there were some
11:44 - um different symbols okay
11:46 - maybe there was this symbol this used to
11:48 - indicate that
11:50 - the
11:53 - letters over which or the word through
11:55 - which this is there has to be in bold
11:59 - okay
12:03 - and suppose some of this that means
12:07 - italics
12:08 - so this was
12:10 - given to the publishers
12:13 - tell them that words you know over with
12:16 - this forward
12:18 - has to be in bold or words on which this
12:21 - was the word needs to be in italics
12:24 - these things are called markups okay
12:28 - the
12:29 - I mean some symbols or something which
12:31 - you know
12:32 - tell a word or tell a paragraph or tell
12:35 - a phrase how to look we're going to look
12:38 - bold it can look italics it you know an
12:41 - Interline can be there on it or
12:44 - can be indicate indented or something or
12:47 - like that okay
12:49 - so similar similarly we in HTML also we
12:53 - have something
12:59 - this letter has to be bold
13:02 - or this has to be emphasized this has to
13:05 - be italics this has to be underlined
13:07 - this is
13:08 - all this can be done yeah
13:12 - that's why it is called a markup
13:14 - language
13:16 - now you might be wondering how this
13:18 - markup is done in HTML so this markup is
13:21 - done using tags
13:24 - don't worry if you have never heard
13:27 - about this term
13:29 - but
13:30 - it is called
13:40 - so let's go to our Chrome and let's go
13:43 - to charity points right and let's see
13:45 - what our estimate has
13:50 - web browser will format and display the
13:53 - contact
13:54 - basically how a web browser a markup is
13:57 - so 10
13:58 - you know content and see how to look
14:02 - with the help of a tag the browser can
14:05 - distinguish between an HTML content and
14:07 - a simple content okay all right
14:11 - now dress of the part we would see in
14:15 - another video and we'll be going to look
14:17 - at
14:18 - two of these
14:20 - main tags
14:22 - one is heading tag
14:27 - and one is
14:30 - paragraph there okay
14:33 - now I will give you homework okay
14:36 - go search moreover what are tags exactly
14:39 - where look deep into it and obviously
14:44 - search for how H or heading tag works
14:47 - and you know how you write it in a
14:52 - HTML code and similarly do the same
14:55 - thing for paragraph tag okay
14:57 - now don't worry I will obviously be
15:00 - teaching it to you in the next video but
15:02 - it would be better if you go and check
15:04 - it out beforehand so you would be like
15:06 - you know it will be more creative
15:08 - and in the previous video we learned
15:10 - about you know what everything we are
15:13 - going to you know
15:15 - look in this video exactly again I mean
15:19 - in the series exactly and
15:22 - what else did you talk about we talked
15:23 - about what are the different languages
15:25 - and Frameworks we would be you know
15:27 - covering in this and we also like talked
15:30 - about a little bit of HTML and
15:32 - what is HTML what does it stand for and
15:34 - you know we did the entire
15:37 - anatomy of the HTML all right
15:41 - so in the end I have we talked about the
15:43 - tags all right I told you that HTML
15:46 - stands for hypertext markup language so
15:47 - markup language we talked about and how
15:49 - markup language I mean how markup is
15:51 - exactly implied here through tax Okay
15:54 - cool so in this video we are going to
15:57 - look at uh how basically tag works okay
15:59 - so for that go to a Chrome browser and
16:03 - open codependent.io game just write code
16:06 - pen dot IO it's go to it however
16:13 - you just click on start coding
16:16 - okay
16:18 - okay so I mean this is my default layout
16:24 - you can just change your layouts from
16:25 - here like this or
16:28 - like this so yeah but I prefer to use
16:30 - this one good so what is this okay let
16:32 - me tell you so these are the code
16:35 - brackets here you write a HTML code your
16:37 - CSS Go to JavaScript code and the same
16:40 - thing
16:40 - as shown here okay in this white web
16:44 - page Okay cool so since we are going to
16:47 - work for HTML only we will just know
16:50 - double click on it and close the CSS and
16:53 - JavaScript for the timing
16:55 - so now what uh we are going to do here
16:57 - is let's let's do
17:00 - um
17:01 - okay let's go to the this thing okay
17:06 - okay
17:08 - this is the one of the web pages which I
17:12 - found okay
17:13 - I mean I share the link with you in the
17:16 - description you might check it from
17:17 - there it is this
17:19 - um adventure of Sherlock Holmes I guess
17:20 - you might have read it
17:22 - I mean I read it
17:24 - um when I was a child
17:27 - so it was like one of my favorite books
17:29 - so Gutenberg is basically a online
17:31 - library so we just went for my favorite
17:35 - book The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
17:37 - and um
17:38 - yeah it is the HTML version of it okay
17:41 - so if you look at this part
17:46 - Okay so
17:49 - okay
17:50 - I mean you are looking at this file rate
17:53 - so my question is how will you
17:57 - you know uh
18:01 - replicate this thing in your
18:04 - my browser okay I mean suppose I just
18:07 - copied this code
18:09 - and
18:11 - I mean pasted it here
18:15 - okay
18:16 - I mean see it is a whole single line
18:19 - right even I have like put the enters
18:23 - here it doesn't matter the this thing is
18:26 - still in one single group
18:29 - okay okay
18:30 - we'll uh you know uh do this step by
18:33 - step okay first of all you can see that
18:36 - the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes this
18:38 - is you know greater than this I mean
18:40 - this is the you can say heading over
18:43 - this is the title exactly
18:45 - okay so how would you like increase this
18:49 - thing okay for that what you'll do you
18:52 - will
18:53 - just write it first and then I'll tell
18:56 - you okay so this this thing H1 what is
19:00 - this
19:01 - H1 is I mean okay
19:03 - let's go down
19:05 - this
19:07 - uh these are angular brackets okay these
19:10 - cells that
19:12 - anything inside of them has to be
19:14 - treated as a tag and whatever we write
19:16 - inside tells us like um
19:20 - how like what are the modifications
19:23 - we'll do okay cool
19:26 - now angular Brack I mean once you open
19:29 - the tab we have to close the tag as well
19:31 - okay otherwise it will think that the
19:33 - whole content from here till wherever we
19:36 - have
19:36 - to be undertaken and Direction but that
19:39 - is not the case you only want um
19:41 - The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to be
19:43 - in you know a little bold so we will
19:45 - just write
19:46 - um
19:48 - let's run here I mean you have to close
19:52 - it like this okay
19:54 - cool see
19:56 - I mean you can see it
20:00 - okay cool
20:01 - now what okay I'll just do one thing
20:07 - yeah
20:10 - okay yeah that looks pretty much it yes
20:15 - yeah
20:16 - but
20:17 - uh what about what about what about if
20:21 - if if I want buy another line and add
20:24 - the condolence in the line how would I
20:27 - do that
20:28 - and wing of it I mean if I just if it
20:32 - would have been a word I word or talk I
20:37 - would just simply click enter but it's
20:39 - not changing here
20:41 - Okay so
20:43 - for that we have tag called Break BR
20:48 - okay
20:52 - okay you can see there is a gap between
20:54 - by another content oil now that's
20:57 - because of BR okay
21:00 - now you might be wondering what is H1
21:03 - what is PR everything okay
21:06 - so the very first thing to become a
21:08 - great coders help yourself okay
21:12 - now to help yourself
21:14 - you must be very good at doubling away
21:16 - so just you know type
21:19 - headings in HTML and go to the first
21:21 - link the first link which I opened was
21:23 - WD School server
21:24 - so you can see HTML editing titles or
21:27 - subtitles that you want to display on a
21:28 - web page okay example are heading one
21:30 - two three four five six of them okay
21:36 - H1 defines the most important heading or
21:38 - the biggest heading and H6 defines the
21:41 - least important thing on the smallest
21:42 - setting okay
21:43 - and after H6 it doesn't matter you can
21:45 - examinate it it won't affect or good so
21:49 - this is about cool
21:51 - now it is browse automatically add
21:55 - some white spaces before and after
21:57 - hitting so that is what happened
21:59 - okay headings are important okay you can
22:02 - read the rest of the steps later and we
22:04 - can check PR tag in HTML again and you
22:08 - can go to w these tools again
22:10 - and you can see inserts single line
22:13 - breaks in a text which we did here okay
22:16 - now to make it a little more better
22:18 - let's write H2 here okay I mean it is a
22:22 - subtitle
22:23 - uh this is important but it is a
22:26 - subtitle
22:27 - cool it looks cool
22:29 - I mean
22:31 - I can write what I can write here H3
22:36 - and I'll close this three
22:39 - okay okay
22:40 - and one more important thing which is
22:44 - there
22:46 - I mean look at this it's looking a
22:48 - little bit good better than okay now one
22:50 - more thing is you can see that BR is we
22:53 - have not closed Bry okay so basically
22:55 - there are two types of tag one which are
22:57 - closing time which requires a closing
22:58 - tag as well and one are open tags they
23:01 - don't require a closing tag like VR okay
23:03 - we'll talk more about what are closing
23:06 - tags what are the open tags later okay
23:08 - so now uh I guess
23:11 - um that was like pretty much it for this
23:13 - video I mean you have to you know
23:17 - um
23:18 - uh retain these things again just go to
23:20 - the web check for first thing tags what
23:23 - are tags like I told you in the previous
23:25 - video as well but
23:27 - look at once again
23:28 - then look at heading tag look at the BR
23:31 - tag okay try to replicate this thing
23:34 - which I did without without looking this
23:36 - code thing okay
23:38 - and and and and what else
23:41 - yeah and go for go and for opening tank
23:45 - and closing times what are they okay
23:47 - cool so we have already covered two
23:50 - videos where we you know talked about
23:51 - the introduction of web development we
23:53 - talked about how internet works and
23:56 - the different languages we are going to
23:57 - use right and then we talked about you
24:01 - know HTML tags and how do they work away
24:05 - so in this video we are going to look at
24:07 - anatomy of tags okay so what exactly is
24:11 - attack
24:12 - okay
24:14 - so suppose simple I write this check
24:23 - okay
24:26 - so basically this
24:31 - um okay cool
24:32 - this whole thing is called a tag okay
24:38 - now these are basically the hell called
24:42 - elements
24:44 - okay this is the content
24:51 - okay this is the closing element
24:57 - and yeah that is it okay
25:01 - this is the whole thing
25:05 - okay now you might see this as
25:14 - so what have what used to happen in in
25:17 - the
25:19 - older period that suppose someone wrote
25:23 - a book and he wrote hello world okay now
25:26 - he wants to you know make the heading
25:29 - bigger so what we do he'll simply put a
25:32 - squiggly line under it okay
25:34 - this wiggly line would be interpreted by
25:38 - a interpreter
25:39 - okay I'll just write an INT that means
25:42 - interpreter okay and he will then
25:46 - understand that okay this sign means I
25:48 - have to you know uh
25:50 - use hello world as a heading or like
25:52 - print it as a heading okay
25:54 - so
25:55 - similar way similar thing happens with
25:58 - our web page where The Interpreter is r
26:03 - browser
26:06 - okay
26:09 - cool
26:11 - so this was the anatomy of this type
26:13 - okay
26:14 - now let's talk about another tag which
26:18 - we use
26:20 - PR tag okay now I would really
26:24 - appreciate if you remember what BR tag
26:27 - uh do oh yeah so if you remember good if
26:30 - you don't I'll tell you in but still try
26:32 - to you know remember
26:35 - or I mean these are the very basic tags
26:37 - and you don't have to Google every time
26:38 - to
26:40 - you know find the functioning of these
26:43 - okay so okay cool uh yeah so BR tag
26:46 - basically breaks
26:48 - or acts as a enter of a keyboard okay
26:53 - slide cool now this is uh only element
26:57 - okay
26:59 - it do not have a Content you do not have
27:02 - a closing element it is it just only
27:04 - have element and this is attack
27:06 - these tags are called
27:07 - cell
27:14 - closing okay your writing is very bad
27:16 - here but still try to manage
27:18 - says closing
27:22 - tags okay
27:25 - now you might be wondering how we you
27:29 - know
27:30 - uh differentiate or know which tag is a
27:35 - element I mean which tag is a
27:41 - self losing time or which tag is a
27:45 - you know
27:47 - you do need to have a closing tab
27:50 - so what you do you just simply go to
27:54 - Dev
27:55 - talks dot IO
27:59 - okay
28:02 - go to HTML go to elements and search for
28:06 - the BR tab where it's here
28:09 - now you go
28:12 - inside
28:14 - okay
28:23 - and here it might be somewhere
28:29 - okay
28:32 - okay where are we exactly
28:39 - okay why is it true button tag here
28:44 - okay the documentation is a little wrong
28:47 - let us run in the button tag but let's
28:50 - see if it works okay it is not working
28:55 - okay let's just say BR tag
29:00 - opening and close okay let's just search
29:03 - this over here
29:06 - okay this is charcoal flow you won't be
29:08 - eating this let's just write uh
29:10 - self-exclusion tag right
29:13 - okay again it's not
29:24 - okay not much is written it should have
29:27 - been here but simply to the button I
29:29 - would let me tell you like this is how
29:30 - you
29:31 - look at your documentation okay
29:34 - okay uh let's see if we go to
29:39 - heading tag
29:43 - here you can see they see that both
29:46 - starting and ending diagram mandatory so
29:47 - this is how you learn it okay we're
29:49 - going to look at one more tag called HR
29:52 - tag
29:53 - Okay so
29:57 - it must have a start tab it must not
29:59 - have an entire okay HR time uh do what
30:01 - exactly
30:02 - it adds the uh
30:06 - this
30:07 - uh what do we say this uh yeah a
30:10 - horizontal line okay
30:12 - so similarly we'll just use
30:15 - HR
30:17 - um HR here
30:20 - right and then we use one more HR here
30:26 - okay now you can see that we got two
30:28 - lines okay
30:31 - but but let me show you one thing
30:37 - okay this site
30:39 - um
30:40 - takes few minutes okay here we are
30:45 - okay
30:46 - okay can you see that R line and again
30:50 - these are the same okay
30:53 - so the documentation has changed of the
30:55 - book as well like it was a different
30:57 - before this but never mind let's look at
31:00 - each attributes okay so what are
31:04 - attributes attributes are basically like
31:06 - C I have created a line here okay
31:10 - but
31:12 - um
31:13 - how to have this double line over
31:15 - different things how to have that use
31:18 - that through attributes okay
31:20 - like there's no shade and there is size
31:24 - and there's width etc etc
31:26 - suppose I write HR
31:29 - I write size as
31:32 - three
31:44 - hmm
31:51 - okay why is it not working here
31:59 - hmm
32:02 - okay
32:08 - okay cool it's working now see the width
32:10 - is different I mean the size different
32:12 - it's a little shade is different so that
32:15 - is how you use the uh these things okay
32:18 - now the only thing left here is
32:20 - put one more tag called
32:22 - Center
32:27 - okay
32:32 - now your task is to check what Center is
32:38 - exactly
32:39 - okay
32:44 - and okay we should be having the same
32:47 - thing here as well otherwise it would be
32:50 - um literacy rate okay yeah
32:56 - cool now you can see it looks coffee's
32:59 - other better right
33:00 - now you now your task is to check how
33:03 - Center works okay and you will comment
33:07 - it in the comment section here okay cool
33:10 - so I guess that was the whole anatomy of
33:13 - the tags
33:16 - all right
33:19 - and
33:22 - and what else okay we talked about let's
33:26 - have a quick recap we talked about tags
33:30 - how okay let's go to the web output how
33:33 - tag looks okay we talked about elements
33:36 - you talked about closing elements you
33:37 - talk about the content then we talk
33:39 - about how it is you know similar to the
33:41 - previous era then we talk about self
33:44 - losing tags right the BR tags and we
33:46 - talked about
33:48 - um
33:48 - documentation which is Dev docs.io
33:53 - on it and then we did some figuring of
33:55 - our own and then we talk about attribute
33:57 - so that's all we covered in this video
33:59 - okay so I hope it was clear to you so in
34:03 - the last three videos
34:04 - um we learned about you know
34:07 - HTML and HTML tags and Anatomy or HTML5
34:12 - right
34:13 - so from this video we would be you know
34:16 - looking forward to enough code in our
34:19 - own
34:23 - ID is like vs code or
34:26 - other ID is assume I work on but I work
34:31 - on this course so I would be like
34:32 - showing you how to do that okay
34:35 - so
34:37 - in this video
34:38 - we are going to look at
34:40 - HTML
34:42 - boilerplate over there now what is a
34:46 - HTML boilerplate so
34:50 - similar boil plate is hot template okay
34:58 - trigger template and it is a
35:02 - necessary
35:04 - template okay
35:08 - uh you know you have to add this HTML
35:11 - border plate for every
35:14 - uh for like every widget you make okay
35:18 - so let me give you an analogy like how
35:23 - this thing works let's um look at this
35:26 - formal letter format okay
35:29 - so here you know you have you have like
35:32 - standard template like name of the
35:34 - sender address State and salutations
35:37 - name definition
35:39 - from here okay
35:41 - and write paragraph and then in the end
35:44 - you like your sincerely name a signature
35:47 - that is how
35:49 - you write or letter okay similar way we
35:53 - have a standard format of HTML
35:54 - boilerplate which we work on
35:57 - okay let's open uh
36:03 - this thing damage team let's
36:06 - um okay to add value create one which
36:10 - clone is just recorded HTML and then
36:12 - click on the HTML file
36:15 - so this is what we call
36:21 - foreign
36:31 - um I mean live one by one
36:36 - to understand what it is all about okay
36:41 - now first is doctrive HTML okay
36:47 - so okay let's create a text
36:51 - uh dog tag
36:54 - so uh DOT type it you know indicates
37:00 - what
37:02 - type
37:05 - of content
37:10 - for
37:12 - language
37:17 - you are
37:20 - what I want okay
37:25 - okay cool
37:28 - so
37:30 - you can see we have dog type of HTML I
37:32 - mean this file has to be seen as an HTML
37:37 - document okay nothing else just an HTML
37:40 - account so I have to see if I have to be
37:43 - seen and whenever I write HTM it is
37:46 - always considered the latest version of
37:48 - it whenever
37:54 - compiler compile this code it written
37:56 - matches are okay this is a HTML file
37:59 - document and I have to read it okay
38:02 - cool
38:04 - now what is this HTML
38:08 - okay
38:10 - so you can see that we have HTML just so
38:14 - this quickly this is the root starting
38:16 - of our HTML file like uh whatever HTML
38:21 - okay
38:26 - all the contents inside this
38:30 - and the closing time of HTML
38:34 - would be
38:36 - announced
38:38 - HTML content which would be uh displayed
38:41 - on the web okay
38:43 - cool
38:46 - now what is this language and this tells
38:48 - us in what language we are basically
38:51 - writing or like for which Target I mean
38:54 - for this audience or Target English
38:57 - now you might have seen that many times
39:00 - uh
39:02 - like there are
39:06 - Auto wise for visually bad people
39:11 - so you know to have the correct
39:13 - pronunciation and everything so it
39:15 - should be known like which language it
39:17 - is reading I mean the web
39:19 - so that's why we
39:22 - specify the language here okay
39:25 - now here comes the head part because
39:30 - okay so head is attack in which uh if we
39:36 - write some things and these things are
39:38 - not visible to a person or to a user
39:43 - okay it tells us that head contents
39:46 - helps the web to render correctly
39:51 - okay
39:53 - and
39:56 - and I guess that is that is the whole
39:59 - thing of how I mean it works okay
40:02 - now we have the metacar set okay
40:06 - so basically this is just the character
40:09 - setting or
40:12 - how we were you know
40:14 - use the character
40:16 - okay
40:17 - for this let's let's do one thing let's
40:20 - go here and let's write
40:23 - cache set
40:25 - utf-8
40:29 - so you can see our duty f8 is a
40:31 - character encoding system
40:34 - with let's represent characters as Sky
40:36 - tags
40:37 - and Chinese selector okay
40:41 - now there are other encoding uh systems
40:45 - as well
40:46 - so let's search for it
40:52 - and coding HTML
40:56 - good in it it's okay
41:10 - you can see that there are different
41:15 - 32 and many others
41:18 - so
41:19 - that is what uh Castle do okay and there
41:24 - are other metas this are like not
41:26 - necessary for you to learn so you can
41:28 - just skip them okay
41:30 - I mean if it would be like helpful in
41:33 - the future I would definitely talk about
41:35 - them but it is currently not required
41:37 - for the beginner sake so we won't talk
41:39 - about it okay
41:42 - here is the uh title okay
41:45 - and then
41:47 - what uh title exactly is let me just
41:52 - show you
41:55 - to do this thing okay
41:59 - simply write google.com Okay
42:03 - good
42:05 - ah whatever thing that comes on the tab
42:08 - part I mean this thing
42:10 - the logo of Google and Google written
42:13 - how that is rendered that is rendered
42:16 - through our title part okay
42:20 - okay I mean I hope that is
42:23 - understood part right cool
42:28 - a headache
42:33 - now comes the body part
42:35 - so body is where you would be spending
42:39 - most of your day okay
42:42 - this is the part where
42:45 - we write the actual HTML code
42:49 - okay
42:50 - and here is like whatever you write will
42:54 - be rendered on the screen
42:56 - so we talked about H1 so I will write um
43:01 - which one here
43:04 - okay I can buy it hello
43:08 - okay then
43:10 - here we can have the
43:14 - let's say my
43:17 - first web page
43:22 - then after you know doing all this okay
43:25 - we did write the code we did everything
43:28 - but how to render yourself yeah that is
43:31 - anything
43:32 - you would click on go live okay
43:36 - now it could be that it won't like go
43:39 - live won't be able to rewind
43:44 - so you have to add the extension for it
43:46 - again like here is the extensions
43:48 - go to extensions and
43:53 - search for live server
43:57 - okay
44:00 - see I have installed it so you just have
44:03 - to uh there would be an install button
44:05 - just click over here
44:06 - and restart your code
44:11 - okay
44:12 - and you will be able to see the whole
44:14 - library now click on the go
44:20 - okay
44:23 - okay I guess I understood what is the
44:26 - problem
44:28 - we have to make a folder okay
44:33 - so let's do one time we'll just
44:38 - have a folder here called okay okay and
44:43 - you select the folder and we'll open
44:45 - that okay
44:48 - now here we have
44:51 - HTML
44:53 - [Music]
44:57 - we will have extreme code
44:59 - I told you about everything
45:06 - my favorite page
45:12 - okay and we would have H1
45:21 - hello world all right now let's travel
45:28 - I can see Hello World which was written
45:30 - the body is rendered on the screen and
45:32 - you can see here
45:33 - title which we wrote here
45:38 - my first web page is written over here
45:42 - cool
45:44 - so I hope uh boilerplate thing is you
45:48 - know
45:49 - like you understood it fine okay and
45:52 - again tell you how to do it this is HTML
45:54 - including I want you would get over it
45:58 - better for you okay then you may change
46:01 - the character speed if you want but I
46:03 - want to recommend that because YouTube
46:04 - is the most common and the most used one
46:07 - foreign
46:11 - right whatever you want to write anybody
46:13 - by okay oh in the last few videos we
46:17 - learned about the basics of HTML right
46:20 - we learned about how to use tab we
46:21 - learned about how do we know you HTML on
46:24 - our own ID and open it on our local
46:26 - browser
46:27 - it will be also talked about
46:30 - HTML
46:32 - [Music]
46:36 - account all right so in this video
46:40 - um any you have understood the basics
46:42 - yet
46:43 - uh to make your own website Okay so
46:49 - yeah I want to you know I look at one
46:53 - Hands-On project okay
46:56 - we'll talk about I mean whatever we have
47:01 - learned until now
47:02 - and along here you also learn few
47:05 - concepts of HTML like
47:09 - um
47:10 - image addition or
47:15 - and what else uh we'll also know about
47:18 - the best we also learn about
47:22 - links hyperlinks Okay so
47:28 - okay so the question of this video is
47:31 - what are we going to make so we are
47:34 - going to make a
47:37 - personal website okay
47:40 - so let's open this okay
47:43 - so this is John cleanberg's website
47:48 - Okay so
47:51 - at corner University look up so this is
47:55 - what we have written
47:59 - okay
48:03 - if only going to vary but uh any you can
48:07 - add your more details and everything but
48:10 - okay we'll see how much we are going to
48:13 - cover okay so see you can see that it's
48:16 - gently looks a bit so I am going to
48:22 - Riley Jones
48:24 - homepage in front of it you
48:28 - okay
48:32 - so let's start it's always HTML with
48:35 - no D we don't need
48:37 - okay
48:38 - here you can write the title yeah I'm
48:42 - going to write this one
48:45 - thing works
48:49 - homepage okay
48:51 - that is all I'm going to do that
48:56 - okay
48:58 - [Music]
48:58 - um
49:07 - let's see okay
49:12 - I have to have all these details here so
49:16 - let's start with the name you should
49:19 - write your own name okay
49:21 - let's write
49:26 - let's
49:26 - [Music]
49:27 - um
49:35 - let's have which one you write
49:40 - clean book okay
49:46 - [Music]
49:47 - foreign
49:49 - [Music]
49:53 - let's copy this
49:56 - is
49:57 - [Music]
50:04 - oh yeah
50:09 - okay if you call C or if you can see
50:13 - this
50:14 - okay
50:16 - [Music]
50:18 - find one kind of whatever little italics
50:22 - right
50:26 - our metallics
50:30 - HTML
50:31 - Indian
50:43 - s
50:48 - visiting
50:53 - VM elements
50:58 - all right
51:01 - okay then I will see them
51:07 - two tags here
51:11 - so let's delete this and we wanted some
51:15 - developers so you can use my how
51:16 - multiple elements
51:24 - okay so by default visual results
51:27 - semantic meaning is different em
51:30 - elements this is
51:32 - Express emphasis of its content okay
51:37 - [Music]
51:41 - Oh by silence
51:48 - has a stress over some time well is
51:51 - simply okay I'll just betrayed this
51:52 - thing okay
51:55 - so that is all that is
51:58 - usually you can have one more tag strong
52:19 - all right
52:21 - foreign
52:40 - [Music]
52:54 - [Music]
52:59 - right
53:02 - [Music]
53:02 - um
53:11 - okay
53:16 - let's see what happened
53:19 - already
53:22 - [Music]
53:27 - so when I am going to add more details
53:29 - here
53:30 - that is
53:35 - one of them
53:37 - I will add to another web page okay
53:40 - we will cover this in further videos
53:44 - so for the timing you just copy
53:48 - this much part
53:50 - all right
53:54 - let's cover the attack
54:00 - [Music]
54:01 - um
54:06 - it looks quite similar very
54:11 - details
54:13 - [Music]
54:19 - let's have it here
54:23 - okay we'll have VR everywhere
54:38 - um
54:39 - [Music]
54:43 - let's open it
54:47 - obviously
54:57 - foreign

55:24 - [Music]
55:27 - here

55:34 - right
55:36 - now we need one thing
55:38 - obviously
55:40 - learn about our feelings
55:42 - obviously but
55:44 - till then we'll just look at
55:48 - this
55:50 - now we can see that there is
55:53 - line break you know how to add it
55:57 - HR
55:59 - Indian
56:03 - like
56:04 - talk about daily deals uh attribute and
56:08 - everything but since you're talking
56:10 - about it again
56:41 - okay this
56:45 - is
56:45 - [Music]
56:50 - fine and this much body
56:54 - yes almost here
56:58 - um
57:05 - next
57:06 - uh what's the lighting of Our Own
57:09 - x48 h35
57:12 - It Was Written here
57:17 - so right oh
57:22 - and
57:25 - [Music]
57:27 - let's see
57:30 - okay
57:31 - [Music]
57:36 - let's cut it and yes it
57:43 - is
57:49 - much better much more identical the
57:53 - speech
57:58 - your own details here
58:01 - right
58:03 - you have to write your own name you have
58:05 - to write your own direction or whatever
58:08 - degree
58:13 - Department College address
58:21 - [Music]
58:27 - which is
58:30 - then you can see we have some bullet
58:32 - points here
58:33 - so I guess this was pretty much it which
58:37 - I intended to come here in this video so
58:40 - in the previous video we learned about
58:42 - uh you know we just started making our
58:44 - own personal uh website I write
58:48 - so we basically you know learn about
58:54 - um
58:55 - putting uh learnings of
58:58 - heading tag and paragraph tag then we
59:00 - also learned about uh emphasize and
59:03 - strong tag as well right
59:05 - and we talked about the difference
59:08 - between the emphasize tag and
59:13 - um
59:15 - uh I mean emphasize second italics tag
59:18 - and uh difference between strong tag and
59:21 - the bull tag all right so if I mean I
59:26 - have started the running of this video
59:27 - and this is what we have achieved till
59:31 - now of this page okay
59:35 - this looks this looks fine all right now
59:39 - we want to add these points but in
59:42 - bullet points right
59:44 - so how to do that
59:47 - so I would highly recommend you guys to
59:53 - I mean try to do this on your own using
59:57 - the Google search and the mdn but I mean
60:01 - your movie is free to you know watch the
60:04 - video but I would highly recommend if
60:06 - you do it on your own otherwise you can
60:08 - follow me here
60:09 - so what we are going to write is
60:13 - um
60:15 - unordered list
60:19 - HTML and we'll decide mdn date
60:23 - okay you can see that we got something
60:26 - about the UL so what does UL stand for
60:30 - UL stands for unordered list
60:33 - okay similarly we have another list
60:35 - called well
60:38 - okay
60:40 - that is orderless we look at the order
60:42 - list um in a while but the timing will
60:46 - learn about the UL time okay
60:49 - so
60:51 - you can see that there are different
60:52 - types
60:54 - one Circle one is disk one is a square
60:57 - okay then one is triangle as well but it
61:00 - is not supported by all your browsers
61:03 - okay so very simple example is this
61:07 - okay
61:09 - tags like I mean
61:11 - uh the syntax of having a list is this
61:16 - okay
61:17 - so what it has we add given in which we
61:21 - have to provide the list okay then in
61:24 - the Ally I mean um
61:28 - DF I mean for every uh list item we
61:34 - include it in the alert app all right
61:38 - then we have a little more complex
61:40 - version of this like this you can check
61:42 - it on your own
61:44 - okay then we have different different
61:46 - things okay so before proceeding let's
61:48 - try to have it in our own website so
61:52 - what we just learned we learned that we
61:54 - have to have a
61:57 - urta
62:00 - okay
62:01 - then we are going to have the less items
62:03 - now how the list item works
62:06 - already talked about let's just copy
62:08 - this okay
62:11 - and let's just write it here
62:15 - all right
62:16 - hmm
62:17 - then let's open another
62:22 - attack
62:24 - and then let's uh
62:27 - okay sorry oh yeah let's copy this
62:37 - all right okay
62:39 - then what uh
62:43 - let's have another light app and let's
62:47 - copy this part
62:50 - okay I mind you I'm just copying this
62:54 - you have to add your own details here
62:58 - okay I mean it is not necessary that you
63:02 - have books and teachings you can write
63:03 - or Hobbies Etc as well all right
63:09 - okay
63:10 - I guess this is enough you mean we don't
63:14 - have to add other ones
63:16 - so you can see
63:17 - see I have the bullet points here
63:20 - all right now uh we saw that there are
63:24 - types as well so what you can do you can
63:26 - write
63:27 - type and you can Define the type let's
63:30 - try the
63:33 - Discord
63:35 - let's see okay the disk is the default
63:38 - one
63:39 - Let's uh
63:42 - Circle
63:44 - now let's see
63:48 - okay the these are the hollow ones okay
63:52 - then there's a type
63:54 - um
63:56 - Square as well let's see okay so you can
64:00 - see that squares are here okay
64:03 - now what we can do is let's add
64:08 - um
64:10 - HR tag here
64:12 - and let's save it
64:15 - let's see
64:17 - okay
64:20 - um
64:23 - should not be here it should be outside
64:25 - the site
64:27 - now let's see
64:31 - looks pretty neat
64:33 - okay now uh
64:35 - I'm doing a little bit different from
64:37 - the website
64:38 - let's have one thing let's have H3 and
64:41 - let's write Hobbies
64:44 - okay you can write our Hobbies here
64:47 - and let's save it
64:49 - let's see how it looks now
64:52 - it looks good all right
64:55 - now
64:57 - when you go down you can
65:01 - check the C also part okay there are
65:05 - other
65:06 - HTML elements related to the
65:09 - one which we're viewing so we can view
65:11 - the ol1 the order disk so orderless is
65:15 - elements represent an order list of
65:18 - items all right so I one two three four
65:21 - five four ABC or in the Roman numericals
65:24 - all right cool
65:28 - what are the types here a follower a for
65:30 - upper F or
65:32 - Lucas Roman numerals and see you can see
65:36 - that default is one but we can have
65:38 - different ones as well
65:40 - okay uh you can go down and you can see
65:43 - it is the same it is like uh similar way
65:46 - which we did the Nautilus we just write
65:50 - order list we enclose it
65:52 - and we write the different types of
65:57 - list items here
65:58 - all right okay then you can check the
66:01 - other parts as well I'll add the link in
66:04 - the description
66:05 - all right but
66:07 - um we look at some of it
66:09 - let's write Ally
66:11 - and let's write our Hobbies okay since I
66:14 - don't know about uh
66:16 - John cleanberg's hobby I'm going to
66:18 - write my own Hobbies okay so okay wait a
66:22 - minute we have to write the all first
66:24 - okay now we'll write Li what we can add
66:27 - in the LI here
66:29 - okay my hobbies are
66:33 - reading novels rate and what else do I
66:38 - like
66:38 - I like
66:43 - playing badminton and I also like
66:51 - bringing my own
66:53 - coffee
66:55 - okay now let's see how it looks okay you
66:57 - can see that the numbering is one two
66:59 - three like like that
67:01 - okay you can obviously
67:05 - change it with the ol
67:09 - type as a
67:14 - you can see that it has changed to ABC
67:17 - and then you can have old type as
67:21 - this let's see one two three that is in
67:24 - the Roman numericals
67:26 - you can have
67:28 - the capital Roman numericals as well
67:31 - all right
67:33 - and then what else was there okay the
67:35 - capital alphabetical order is also there
67:38 - huh cool this looks pretty neat
67:41 - all right let's just add an HR tag here
67:46 - save it let's see okay this looks uh
67:50 - pretty nice all right
67:53 - hmm okay that's nice
67:56 - now what else uh do we need to learn
67:59 - about here like we learned about the
68:01 - bullet points we learned about
68:02 - headings we learned about paragraphs you
68:05 - learned about the HR tag now what else
68:07 - what else can you see in the website
68:08 - which we have not used here
68:10 - okay
68:12 - I guess
68:13 - um you must have guessed it correctly we
68:14 - haven't used
68:16 - these links right I mean if I click on
68:19 - this this would take me to some other
68:21 - page
68:23 - so these are called
68:26 - um links hyperlinks and we use
68:29 - um I mean
68:31 - we inculcate this in our website through
68:35 - anchor tab all right
68:37 - so
68:38 - I guess we'll talk about the anchor tag
68:41 - later in the week I mean later in the
68:43 - next video
68:44 - so since for this video I guess the list
68:48 - part was covered and we covered the
68:50 - unordered list and the order list and
68:53 - the different types of both of them okay
68:56 - now you may play with the list and you
68:59 - may check the other attributes of the
69:01 - list and I'll post the description in
69:04 - the box and you can check it from there
69:05 - okay
69:06 - so thanks for watching this video and
69:08 - see you later
69:12 - and so far we have been working on our
69:19 - just give me a minute yeah okay so we
69:22 - are working on our personal website uh
69:25 - right
69:26 - using HTML let's see what we have got so
69:29 - far okay
69:33 - so this is the effect which we have you
69:36 - know
69:37 - so according to me it looks good
69:42 - okay we learned about you know HR tag
69:45 - and
69:47 - uh H1 attack
69:49 - DM system tag
69:53 - we learned about the points and other
69:57 - things after okay
69:59 - great
70:01 - now uh another thing which I want you
70:05 - guys to know is let's just go to the
70:08 - homepage
70:10 - as you can see these
70:12 - um
70:14 - links right okay
70:16 - if we click on this link waiting into
70:20 - some other page okay
70:23 - so how to have these things
70:28 - okay so what you can do you can click on
70:30 - inspect
70:31 - and then you can see that there is
70:33 - something called a
70:34 - a tag and there's some hrdf
70:37 - so we'll talk about what all of these
70:40 - things are let's just say
70:42 - anchor tag HTML MDM let's go here
70:47 - and you can see what anchor element is
70:49 - Anchor element
70:51 - within
70:52 - attribute creates a hyperlink okay
70:57 - Two web pages file email address
71:00 - location in the same page or anything
71:02 - else a URL can address okay
71:06 - no
71:08 - within each a we should indicate the
71:10 - links destination
71:13 - okay
71:14 - it is done through the href tag and then
71:18 - there are attributes which you can you
71:21 - know
71:22 - uh check on your own although these are
71:25 - not very much important I'd say
71:29 - um there's one called Target which we'll
71:31 - see later
71:32 - okay so let's rather than just reading
71:36 - let's try on uh see how it works okay
71:40 - suppose I have to specify this
71:44 - uh so what will I do I just copy this
71:46 - address
71:48 - and I'll try to put it over here okay
71:53 - I just come here
71:55 - uh
71:57 - there was that let's just see
71:59 - it's over Department of computer science
72:02 - uh where is it okay
72:05 - so let's just remove it for now what
72:08 - you'll do we'll put the anchor tag
72:11 - okay you will put a href which we just
72:15 - copied
72:16 - and here you will have
72:24 - computer science okay now we'll go to
72:27 - our website and see okay there's the
72:28 - link which is the detail as well if I
72:31 - click on the link
72:34 - have to be taken I would be taken to
72:36 - this page and if I click here
72:48 - the website is a bit slow
72:55 - yeah why is the website different I mean
72:58 - we just copied the same address
73:05 - okay it was um loading error but you can
73:09 - see that both websites are same okay
73:12 - in a similar way let's try put one over
73:15 - information files
73:17 - like present here we'll just you know
73:19 - copy the link
73:23 - and let's just have the
73:26 - eight I over here
73:29 - let's just close it
73:31 - and let's write
73:33 - sref and let's paste it let's save it
73:38 - and what we come up with
73:42 - again uh I mean you know you go to jail
73:46 - so
73:47 - what we are doing here exactly okay so
73:49 - that is that
73:52 - another thing which I wanted to talk was
73:54 - Target okay Target is you know where to
73:57 - display the linked URL okay it can be
74:00 - the current browser context which is by
74:04 - default blank is basically a new top uh
74:08 - new tab
74:09 - okay
74:10 - so what does that mean exactly let's see
74:14 - suppose I put the
74:18 - Target as say blank let's save it let's
74:22 - see what we got here now
74:24 - okay it opens in a new tab rather than
74:27 - if I click here it gets open in the same
74:30 - tab
74:31 - so that is what the difference is okay
74:36 - similar with a cell which is the current
74:39 - one uh current browsing context which is
74:42 - the default one which we already saw
74:46 - then this is these two are there which
74:49 - are not
74:50 - um
74:52 - not available
74:59 - [Music]
75:14 - from Hobbies this part
75:18 - I'll just copy Ctrl C sorry control X
75:23 - I'll save it and let's see what our
75:25 - website looks
75:27 - okay it looks like this
75:30 - right uh
75:34 - and okay
75:42 - okay now what I am going to do is I'm
75:46 - going to put an H3 tag with it would be
75:49 - saying my
75:52 - Hobbies okay now let's see how it looks
75:56 - okay
75:57 - and if I put an anchor tie here
76:02 - I feel my whole beef
76:07 - okay I'll just remove this part
76:11 - okay
76:12 - and here I just paste whatever was
76:15 - written here
76:17 - now I can have
76:20 - t h r e f apps
76:24 - always okay
76:30 - okay now if I go here
76:33 - you can see there's a link if I click
76:34 - over here I would be taken to
76:38 - our new
76:41 - page.html so this is called uh internal
76:45 - linking of our web pages I mean you can
76:47 - have n number of web pages here
76:50 - and if you want to Interlink them you
76:52 - can Interlink them via this okay
76:55 - either internal linking which we just
76:57 - saw okay date
77:00 - so that was all uh which
77:04 - was to be taught about hack attack
77:07 - online
77:09 - so now we have learned how to put the
77:12 - links here which we can see here as a I
77:16 - mean you can put other links as well
77:19 - here everywhere like where you want but
77:22 - I just wanted to give you a gist of it
77:24 - so that was there okay so that was all
77:27 - for this video
77:29 - thank you for watching and see you later
77:33 - web development series and in this video
77:37 - what we are going to do
77:40 - um
77:41 - we are going to learn about the image
77:45 - stack
77:47 - okay so by the name you can't figure it
77:50 - out uh what it is it is all about it is
77:53 - basically
77:55 - inserting our
77:57 - images
77:59 - okay or what can I say embedding our
78:02 - images
78:03 - um
78:05 - inside our
78:09 - page or web page I would say
78:12 - okay
78:13 - so it is that
78:16 - now we come back here and let's just go
78:19 - IMG
78:21 - MD and HTML
78:23 - okay
78:26 - and we come to here
78:30 - okay modular
78:32 - developer work
78:35 - okay
78:39 - and I go to here
78:45 - um
78:49 - slow uh my neck
78:52 - okay but anyways the page
79:10 - okay
79:13 - so IMG tag is basically image embed
79:17 - element it basically embeds our image
79:19 - into the a document
79:21 - okay then uh you know supported uh
79:25 - formats and other stuff
79:28 - which we won't be needing a search
79:32 - all right so yeah great works
79:36 - now what we can do is
79:40 - uh
79:43 - this is index.html right
79:46 - what we want to do let's open a folder
79:51 - um in the desktop let's make a folder of
79:55 - file name
79:57 - image and let's just select folder and
80:01 - here
80:02 - I'll tell you why we are doing this
80:04 - later but here we'll have our index shot
80:08 - HTML
80:10 - okay and
80:15 - what we can do is we can first check how
80:18 - to use it so the way how you get class
80:23 - not necessary
80:24 - there are two attributes SRC and ALT
80:27 - okay
80:29 - first we will talk about this RC
80:30 - attribute I mean it is required and it
80:33 - contains the path to the image you want
80:35 - to impact now you can either embed the
80:38 - element or I mean the image
80:42 - uh from
80:46 - uh like your local desktop or what you
80:49 - can do is you can embed the image from
80:52 - the URL of any website splash
80:59 - .com
81:02 - and what I'm going to do this is the
81:05 - nice image I'll just pick it
81:08 - I'll just cop
81:11 - y
81:13 - um image address
81:16 - I am going to do something like IMG and
81:20 - ALT if not we have not looked at it so
81:23 - I'll just delete it and the SRC I'll
81:25 - just
81:26 - paste this link
81:28 - now if I go live on my website
81:32 - this is what I'm getting okay next date
81:36 - you can you can also set the width and
81:39 - the height of the image as well
81:41 - with let's say 100 pixels and
81:45 - height also as uh and it's work now we
81:50 - go back and
81:52 - copy it now I mind you that we don't set
81:55 - the width or height uh through our
82:00 - HTML for that I already told you for
82:03 - beautify for styling we have CSS right
82:10 - now suppose uh what I'll do there is
82:15 - this image I'll do what
82:17 - I'll
82:19 - save this image
82:21 - in the
82:23 - water the folder name image right
82:27 - so I'll just save it here
82:30 - okay and then what I am going to do you
82:33 - can see that there is
82:34 - and what I'll do is remove this and here
82:38 - I'll try to add Premium Photo okay this
82:41 - is the local photo which I am having and
82:44 - this is what I can
82:46 - nice great yes
82:48 - so
82:51 - um that was all about the
82:53 - SRC tag and then there is something
82:56 - called Alt
82:57 - okay so all basically is an attribute
82:59 - which holds the text description of the
83:01 - image which is in mandatory but is
83:03 - incredibly useful accessibility
83:06 - so the pose by mistakes I used a
83:10 - different URL a wrong URL here then what
83:12 - would happen it would not be loaded
83:15 - but then I can like tell the users that
83:18 - okay you cannot load the image that is
83:20 - fine but you can like get an idea about
83:22 - the images so suppose this is a flower
83:24 - interface okay
83:25 - what I'm going to do here is I'm going
83:27 - to write alt and I'm going to go to
83:29 - write flower and base okay I'll just
83:32 - save it
83:33 - suppose here uh I just write some
83:37 - gibberish and I save it if I go to
83:39 - obviously the mesh path is wrong so it
83:42 - is not loading but it's all text is
83:43 - present there which tells or which gives
83:46 - us an idea of what it is right
83:48 - so yeah right what we are going to learn
83:51 - is we are going to learn about tables
83:53 - all right how a table looks and
83:56 - everything about it okay
83:59 - so let me just show you how a table
84:02 - looks okay
84:04 - suppose
84:07 - this is a table
84:09 - okay I mean data
84:13 - data data data okay cool
84:20 - so how do we exactly make a table so
84:24 - let's go to HTML uh let's go to Chrome
84:26 - and first let's see what we are going to
84:29 - like what we are expect to make
84:32 - so like suppose you have to add a work
84:35 - experience like this
84:37 - okay I mean it cannot be good like this
84:39 - obviously
84:41 - this is a structured using CSS so
84:45 - let's let's okay let's do one thing
84:48 - let's just write the code first
84:50 - okay let's have H1
84:54 - okay work
84:58 - experience right
85:01 - let's save it let's just go live for a
85:05 - second
85:07 - okay cool
85:09 - now suppose I have a paragraph or
85:15 - okay let's do one thing let's have a
85:19 - list
85:21 - okay
85:27 - okay
85:30 - and let's select 2002 to 2004
85:36 - SG at x y z okay
85:43 - now let's see how it looks
85:47 - hmm
85:49 - I mean we can do one thing we can just
85:52 - have
85:53 - UL over here
85:55 - okay
86:00 - okay I mean suppose I just
86:04 - add this and you have a cap
86:07 - I mean okay yeah let's
86:10 - save it
86:12 - now let's see
86:14 - cool
86:16 - okay sorry my bad yeah
86:19 - and let's write
86:25 - um
86:27 - another tag of
86:30 - 2003 to 2004.
86:33 - and research
86:43 - done at ABC
86:47 - let's go and see I mean see it's not
86:51 - very much aligned
86:52 - I mean you can see right and how to
86:56 - exactly do that so that's the question
86:58 - here
86:59 - right so let's just do one thing let's
87:03 - just remove the UL for now
87:07 - okay let's go to table
87:12 - HTML mdn we'll just go to the table part
87:15 - um
87:16 - just come down and
87:19 - see this
87:20 - this is how simple table is made
87:23 - okay
87:25 - cool
87:27 - but just don't think so it is very
87:30 - simple like that I mean we can have
87:33 - complex tables
87:36 - um
87:38 - like this as well
87:41 - all right
87:43 - cool so now let's do one thing let's
87:45 - just go to
87:48 - here and let's just try and write our
87:51 - Code table code of our own so just write
87:53 - table okay
87:55 - then okay if you go back let's go to
87:59 - simple one you can see that there's
88:01 - something called TR something called TD
88:04 - so let me tell you what TR and TD is
88:06 - exactly so see whatever is inside a
88:10 - column is a TD
88:12 - and whatever like this single row
88:17 - this is called TR
88:20 - so TR stands for table row and TD stands
88:23 - for table data cool okay so suppose if I
88:28 - write TR that means I have made a single
88:29 - row
88:30 - okay enough I have to write a TD here
88:33 - I'll just write 2002 to 2000.
88:37 - 4 okay then I'll write another TD
88:42 - and I'll write as G at x y z
88:47 - let's say let's write any internet if I
88:51 - did
88:52 - okay now if I have to make another row
88:54 - what I'll do I'll just simply write here
88:56 - again
88:58 - okay I'll write TD and I'll write
89:01 - something
89:03 - 2005 to
89:05 - 2007 let's suppose let's say and then
89:08 - we'll write another TD and
89:10 - um we'll do what uh we'll simply
89:14 - write
89:15 - um
89:20 - ABC
89:23 - okay now let's see
89:37 - I mean you can see that there is Gap
89:41 - here
89:42 - okay
89:44 - um
89:47 - okay suppose I write
90:01 - let's go to attribute let's see let's
90:04 - see
90:07 - okay
90:23 - Okay cool so this is what it is
90:28 - I mean
90:31 - it's still looking a bit
90:34 - I mean see that these two are aligned
90:37 - these two are aligned on that's how
90:40 - this looks like a table
90:42 - okay now one more thing
90:46 - um which I wanted to talk about here is
90:49 - um
90:50 - table is basically divided into three
90:52 - parts
90:53 - okay
90:56 - uh
91:02 - okay sorry yeah
91:09 - so one is called T head
91:14 - one is called the body
91:18 - and one is called the foot okay
91:22 - so I can just you know copy this stuff
91:29 - whole part and write in my
91:33 - body
91:35 - okay I'll save it
91:38 - and in the head part what I can write
91:40 - instead of t d I will write th
91:45 - okay
91:47 - I'll write ears
91:51 - and in another th I'll write work
91:58 - or
92:00 - let's say designation
92:03 - okay let's save it let's go to our
92:05 - website and see that it has been built
92:11 - the head part similarly the thing goes
92:13 - for the foot part you might be wondering
92:15 - why do we separate these terms with
92:18 - these separate resource because
92:19 - sometimes we have to you know
92:21 - isolate a specific part in our
92:26 - table like suppose I have to isolate
92:29 - this part and customize it using CSS
92:32 - which I can do later
92:34 - hold it cool
92:36 - now you might be wondering that
92:39 - something like
92:41 - this this
92:43 - I mean they have borders but why don't
92:46 - our code have borders right
92:49 - I mean this is a very
92:53 - generic thing which might be coming to
92:56 - your mind so let's just go to the
92:58 - attribute and let's read the attributes
93:02 - align BG color border Etc and you can
93:05 - see that there is this
93:08 - icon beside them since icon means
93:11 - depress deprecated okay not for using
93:15 - new websites
93:18 - so
93:20 - uh
93:22 - deprecated exactly what does it exactly
93:25 - mean is that it
93:28 - is outdated
93:31 - and no longer in use
93:37 - all right I mean see first we had floppy
93:42 - disks right but then it got converted
93:45 - into pin drives now right no one use
93:48 - floppy disks
93:49 - yeah so what does that mean that
93:53 - I mean it still does the work but still
93:57 - we don't use it anymore because we have
94:00 - something more efficient something
94:01 - better
94:02 - so we go we can't see to achieve a
94:05 - similar effect use the CSS property
94:07 - somewhere okay
94:10 - and borders CSS border but so since we
94:14 - have not learned CSS we will try to have
94:16 - a border here
94:18 - okay
94:19 - uh so what we'll do we'll go to table we
94:23 - write
94:24 - border we'll write one
94:28 - okay let's see the website now
94:31 - see we got a border here
94:33 - right uh 90s look type order which is
94:37 - which was used before
94:40 - right so yeah
94:42 - so I guess that was all for the table
94:44 - part uh so far we have learned a lot
94:47 - about HTML right in about the basic HTML
94:51 - codes and then we made our own portfolio
94:55 - website and
94:57 - then we learn about
95:00 - uh image tags and lists and everything
95:04 - and now we have come to
95:07 - uh how to create forms all right in HTML
95:13 - so okay I'll just open my Chrome I have
95:16 - this spec so a form basically looks like
95:19 - this right
95:21 - where you got a first name a last name
95:23 - date of birth I mean these can be
95:26 - anything but you can like type your own
95:28 - things here and click on the submit
95:31 - button on this information gets
95:33 - submitted right
95:34 - is what a form is all right so before
95:37 - jumping in what we'll do we'll decide
95:39 - forms
95:42 - HTML and
95:44 - MDR okay
95:47 - we'll just open this link
95:49 - uh
95:51 - formation element print document section
95:55 - containing interactive controls for
95:57 - submitting information like this or date
96:00 - then there are attributes and stuff you
96:03 - can like read about it and get what it
96:07 - means exactly
96:10 - all right and then like there are
96:13 - different things then we have some
96:14 - examples and stuff like that
96:18 - okay so let's let's do one thing let's
96:22 - go here
96:23 - and let's write
96:26 - form
96:30 - I mean don't need an action as such
96:33 - right now we'll talk about it later now
96:35 - we have created a form
96:37 - let's go live let's see
96:46 - okay it's empty what does that mean
96:51 - so I mean this just simply means that we
96:55 - got an interactive thing with this all
96:59 - right
97:00 - so you can like think it as
97:06 - what that
97:08 - this tag does is
97:12 - create something like this
97:14 - all right that's it
97:16 - there is no information in here as such
97:20 - how we get I mean
97:24 - these things and these boxes
97:27 - so for that
97:30 - um we got our name uh sorry we got two
97:34 - things uh one is labels
97:37 - okay
97:40 - and one is input
97:43 - all right
97:45 - uh
97:46 - so these are texts basically written for
97:52 - you know addressing a box like this are
97:55 - called labels and these boxes are called
97:59 - um
98:01 - input input boxes all right so you can
98:04 - have different type of inputs
98:06 - um
98:07 - let's just go to input here and let's
98:10 - see
98:11 - so there are a lot of input types there
98:16 - are buttons check boxes
98:20 - and whatnot
98:22 - okay so you just try one thing let's
98:24 - just try and make something called label
98:30 - okay
98:33 - I mean the phone is not needed this
98:35 - right name here
98:38 - for now
98:40 - okay and then write
98:45 - um input type text
98:48 - all right let's try and see this
98:51 - yeah that is right here then let's go to
98:54 - our page again you can see okay you got
98:57 - something here right
98:58 - and is it sometime
99:02 - similarly uh what you can have is
99:07 - tag here cool
99:09 - you can have the friendly builds I mean
99:12 - see
99:13 - the text box is one important and
99:17 - you can see that this button is the
99:20 - another important thing right
99:22 - so let's uh let's remove the label for
99:26 - now let's just write
99:29 - I mean we don't need a label right now
99:31 - let's just write input
99:34 - type
99:37 - uh button
99:39 - all right let's just remove this
99:42 - input and we're gonna sound button here
99:45 - let's have a value uh Summit
99:48 - let's save it and let's just go to
99:51 - webpage let's see
99:52 - cool I mean see it's not aligned or
99:55 - anything obviously
99:57 - but uh make all the alignment I just
100:00 - told you we do it using CSS
100:04 - but still try to see it it looks
100:06 - something all right
100:09 - cool similarly you can have other input
100:11 - types which you can check on your own
100:13 - like
100:14 - there is a post check box
100:17 - um
100:19 - new ID is not required right now we'll
100:21 - talk about it later
100:23 - we'll have input as daytime another
100:27 - important input I want to talk about is
100:30 - password
100:36 - password
100:38 - is favored let's go here
100:41 - yeah
100:42 - we got a lot of things but
100:46 - uh
100:49 - when the date time is not working
100:54 - okay let's just go here let's okay it's
100:57 - a simple date
100:59 - uh let's go let's just update here okay
101:04 - save it
101:07 - you can see you can use the date from
101:10 - here you can have the check box and see
101:12 - the password box
101:13 - what's interesting here is see the
101:17 - password is encrypted all right so yeah
101:21 - so you can check the input of mdn and
101:26 - you can like have different different
101:27 - types you may check it on your own and
101:30 - see how everything works all right
101:33 - so I guess that was all for
101:35 - um right now about the
101:39 - forms we'll in the next video we will
101:42 - try and look at
101:44 - um
101:45 - what do we see
101:48 - my form all right in the previous video
101:52 - we learned about forms okay let's just
101:55 - start this thing and let's see what uh
101:57 - we get here exactly
101:59 - so this is kind of like I told you about
102:02 - the form thing right so this is how it
102:04 - gently looks all right but in the
102:08 - previous video I told you that uh we are
102:11 - going to you know
102:12 - um
102:13 - make a form like make an exact like a
102:18 - representable form
102:19 - all right
102:21 - so let's do one thing let's just remove
102:24 - all this okay
102:27 - let's just add this thing all right and
102:31 - now we can make a form
102:34 - okay let's write this H3 and let's see
102:38 - contact me
102:40 - all right
102:43 - uh let's add a charter
102:47 - and let's have no shade
102:52 - and
102:53 - photos for the thickness one
103:00 - okay I don't remember that but let's see
103:04 - what we got so far
103:06 - okay
103:10 - okay I have everything is spelling wrong
103:12 - here
103:13 - according
103:15 - [Music]
103:18 - okay
103:19 - let's do one thing it's a change at 2h1
103:23 - okay
103:24 - let's see okay looks better
103:28 - okay let's have the form we have action
103:32 - [Music]
103:39 - all right let's have the form
103:43 - okay we got method and an action all
103:45 - right
103:46 - let's have a label
103:50 - which
103:52 - which says
103:57 - uh
104:01 - first name
104:04 - okay then we'll have an input here
104:08 - uh yeah type text let's save it
104:13 - let's see how it looks okay looks a bit
104:16 - uh better okay
104:19 - now
104:21 - I want you to check
104:24 - one thing required
104:27 - in HTML
104:31 - okay let's go to this link
104:33 - uh and
104:35 - you can see that require attribute isn't
104:39 - it specifies that and input field must
104:41 - be filled out before submitting the form
104:43 - okay
104:44 - so
104:46 - uh suppose I have
104:51 - I have
104:54 - required return here okay
104:58 - and let's have a br tag here for now
105:02 - and let's have a
105:05 - look at my bag
105:08 - input
105:11 - type
105:14 - but
105:24 - submit okay
105:29 - okay now the submit button is here if I
105:32 - write without writing anything if I try
105:34 - to submit it
105:35 - we got this radiation that please fill
105:39 - out this form all right
105:42 - course looks cool now we have another
105:46 - attribute which is important is
105:48 - placeholder
105:50 - uh it means that sometimes the Box uh
105:54 - something is written there to you know
105:56 - tell user what to exactly fail so let's
106:00 - say write your
106:03 - first name
106:04 - okay let's save it let's see now
106:07 - uh see that there's a placeholder when
106:11 - no text is written now I can write text
106:13 - here
106:14 - okay let's write quote D we get it right
106:19 - okay cool
106:21 - now what else we can have let's have
106:24 - another label and
106:28 - write
106:32 - last name for now
106:35 - we'll have input type text
106:40 - and run we will add a br texture and
106:45 - let's have a placeholder
106:48 - right your
106:53 - last name
106:55 - rate and
107:01 - and we'll have a required field as well
107:05 - okay
107:07 - hmm
107:08 - okay let's go see
107:11 - okay
107:13 - uh not very great but
107:16 - still I mean it's something right
107:21 - I mean The Styling we'll do using CSS
107:24 - and we'll reach there
107:28 - let's again have an input of
107:32 - type email
107:35 - okay
107:42 - and
107:43 - you can have a br tagger
107:46 - okay okay we haven't added a label here
107:49 - let's just add a link
107:51 - [Music]
107:52 - uh
107:56 - email
107:57 - okay okay
107:59 - this works I guess
108:05 - hmm
108:08 - okay this looks good
108:11 - okay and
108:17 - we'll have required and
108:24 - placeholder as
108:27 - write your email
108:29 - all right
108:32 - okay looks good and another thing of
108:35 - this attribute is that it would go
108:38 - through basic validation tests of
108:41 - whether we have written the correct
108:42 - email or not
108:43 - wait what are the basic uh emails what
108:47 - are they like we are at the rate and Dot
108:51 - I mean
108:52 - these two will be the basic validations
108:53 - of an email right
108:55 - so let's just go here let's write
108:57 - something blah blah blah
109:00 - okay you can see that please include and
109:03 - update in in the email address and
109:07 - we'll suppose we just add it okay
109:12 - we have to enter a part following this
109:15 - at the rate obviously let's write yeah
109:17 - for now
109:19 - okay any other validation
109:23 - no that's it that is all the validation
109:25 - that is there right
109:27 - okay cool
109:32 - hmm
109:33 - all right
109:37 - so what else can be there hey in your
109:42 - contact me form what else can be there
109:45 - oh another thing which can be real let's
109:50 - say
109:51 - uh your
109:54 - message okay that also works
109:57 - okay
109:59 - and the input type here is would be
110:03 - uh
110:07 - text area
110:08 - okay so let's uh texture as well
110:17 - okay
110:23 - input diapers
110:28 - and then input a what we'll have here is
110:31 - simple text area like this okay
110:35 - we don't want name you don't want ID
110:37 - for now
110:39 - okay this column tells us like how wide
110:43 - would be our text area and this row cell
110:46 - is how long it would be okay
110:49 - see it is like this
110:52 - uh let's just first of all let's add a
110:55 - br let's save it
110:57 - yeah so you can also like uh uh change
111:01 - the width height through this button as
111:04 - well but for the initial boilerplate it
111:07 - should be like this
111:08 - okay okay cool now we talked about that
111:13 - thermometer functionality would come
111:14 - through JavaScript but right also we can
111:18 - have the submit button functionality
111:21 - okay how it would be let's say let's see
111:25 - in the action
111:27 - uh what we'll write
111:29 - mail
111:32 - to
111:35 - info
111:37 - and here like mail 2 would be like
111:40 - whatever mail you want to be get like
111:44 - uh
111:49 - let's write my email address here first
111:52 - of all okay
111:54 - so this action would do what it would uh
111:57 - open my mail ID and the
112:01 - I mean the receiver uh the receiver
112:05 - address would be this all right
112:07 - cool now let's go to this and let's try
112:10 - to submit this
112:12 - okay all right
112:14 - okay I'll just write my name here
112:20 - look at this let's hit something and try
112:22 - to submit okay one thing you can see
112:25 - that it is not submitting off even after
112:27 - adding this and everything that this is
112:29 - because we don't have email Handler so
112:31 - how to add email under we'll just go to
112:34 - these three dots we'll go to settings
112:36 - you go to privacy and security okay
112:41 - then we load site settings
112:44 - then you go to additional permissions
112:47 - then we go to protocol handles you can
112:49 - uncheck this icon
112:51 - uh site scanners 200 protocols and we
112:54 - and you can you know remove this from
112:57 - here
112:58 - I'll write that as it open your mail ID
113:04 - this icon would come here just you know
113:07 - go to it and click on allow done
113:10 - close it
113:12 - now try to submit it
113:16 - uh
113:21 - it would open my mail ID
113:26 - the sender here would be this
113:30 - uh right
113:33 - okay
113:34 - and
113:38 - it hasn't added the
113:41 - texture I don't know why is that
113:47 - let's check if we have not added
113:50 - anything
113:50 - [Music]
113:53 - okay we'll have the entire pass
113:57 - to explain okay we got our okay one more
114:02 - thing
114:03 - uh
114:04 - that is not a thing
114:09 - I don't see any problem as such
114:13 - okay let's write something let's add
114:16 - something let's set something adderate
114:19 - something
114:20 - that is something I will let's
114:23 - try to do some of this let's see
114:25 - hopefully it should work now
114:31 - all right
114:33 - uh
114:35 - it says
114:38 - till the
114:41 - there's you know text here
114:44 - why is this happening exactly let's go
114:48 - back to our code let's check if we are
114:51 - missing something
114:53 - hmm
114:55 - I
115:00 - I don't think so we are missing anything
115:03 - like that I guess there is some problem
115:05 - with the main ID right now all right
115:08 - so if I get the you know solution for it
115:13 - I'll add it in the comment box or like
115:16 - whatever the problem would be at this
115:18 - time I would put it in the comment box
115:20 - other than that
115:22 - this is the required code already
115:24 - so I guess uh we just understood how to
115:28 - make our basic contact form will be
115:31 - placeholders with required Fields the
115:34 - email field and with the text box all
115:37 - right so thanks for watching with this
115:39 - so thank you for watching this video and
115:41 - see you later
115:43 - hello everyone and I welcome you all to
115:46 - another video of our web development
115:48 - series and
115:50 - we have leveled up all right so we have
115:53 - you know learned
115:55 - uh respectable amount of HTML like you
116:00 - would be required to make any
116:06 - um you know representable form of web
116:09 - page uh you would be able to do it
116:11 - you know we talked about forms and we
116:14 - talked about tables we talked about
116:16 - lists we talk about you know basic HTML
116:18 - boilerplates and everything
116:20 - all right and there are other things
116:23 - which I don't feel necessary but if you
116:27 - want you who can look for it I mean
116:30 - iframe is there and
116:32 - some other stuff you can look that on
116:34 - your own right
116:36 - so from this video we would be starting
116:38 - uh CSS all right
116:41 - so what does CSS stands for CSS stands
116:44 - for cascading
116:47 - styling
116:49 - sheet
116:52 - all right
116:54 - just put it here let's create okay
116:58 - cool
117:00 - now what are the reasons yeah CSS is
117:04 - used
117:05 - why can't we just you know use HTML for
117:07 - the selling because see HTML stylings
117:13 - if you talk about uh
117:18 - uh it is not preferred all right because
117:20 - see
117:21 - because of HTML styling the alignment
117:25 - gets all messed up
117:27 - all right let me write
117:31 - a line all right and sometimes it does
117:34 - not produce the
117:37 - correct
117:39 - result as well okay
117:42 - it messes the layout now let's just go
117:45 - quickly and check
117:47 - CSS
117:49 - H uh
117:53 - mdn box
117:55 - all right
118:01 - so CSS cascading style sheets so it is
118:06 - you know basically a style sheet
118:07 - language used to describe the
118:08 - presentation of
118:10 - markup languages so markup languages
118:12 - include HTML or XML
118:15 - okay and then all other things as well
118:19 - all right so
118:20 - currently uh that is all the theory you
118:24 - should be knowing about CSS okay
118:26 - and let's do one thing let's go here and
118:30 - let's see how do we add our you know
118:34 - CSS so let's do one thing
118:36 - let's write style dot CSS
118:41 - and how do we basically link it with our
118:45 - HTML
118:46 - so here you just write
118:53 - link CSS
118:56 - okay actually Ariel is basically
118:59 - relationship which is style sheet almost
119:01 - all right then there is
119:05 - hyperreference which is this styles.css
119:07 - okay cool
119:09 - now let's just go to style.css
119:12 - and how do we basically style things
119:17 - so just just you know let's go uh and
119:21 - see what the web page look like okay
119:23 - this look like this
119:25 - now what if I have to add the background
119:30 - uh here what I'll do I'll simply write
119:34 - background color
119:37 - CSS mdn
119:40 - all right I'll just
119:44 - go here
119:46 - I just go here I'll just check it how we
119:49 - do it
119:51 - so use the background color
119:55 - like this okay
119:58 - so let us sit there all right now what
120:03 - we
120:06 - do exactly is
120:09 - C
120:11 - suppose I have to
120:16 - uh
120:17 - modify the whole area there right
120:21 - so
120:23 - I'll be using a tag there right
120:27 - okay and
120:30 - how do we like exactly use the
120:36 - um
120:37 - attacking and everything oh let's see I
120:41 - go here
120:43 - see this Tiger's body I'll simply say
120:46 - body
120:48 - and I'll open this thing
120:51 - and
120:53 - I'll write here
120:55 - background color
120:58 - and I got a very nice background color
121:02 - so I'll just write the background color
121:04 - code it's e a f
121:09 - and then I'll write 6 F6 6 okay
121:14 - receiver
121:16 - we'll go here
121:19 - see background color has again it is
121:22 - looking kinda pretty all right like at
121:24 - least two minutes
121:26 - kind of looking fitted to me all right
121:29 - so that is one thing then you can
121:34 - you know the changes in the H1 as well
121:37 - okay let's do one thing let's try this
121:40 - one
121:41 - and let's see how do we know add color
121:45 - in the text
121:47 - I'll just simply say
121:49 - X color CSS mdl
121:51 - we'll go here we'll see how it works so
121:54 - it's just simply color the color
121:55 - property set the foreground color value
121:58 - of an element text and text decoration
122:00 - set the current color value
122:03 - okay so we'll just come here we'll
122:06 - simply write color
122:08 - and again I got a very nice color which
122:12 - is 6X p f p f
122:17 - okay it's the same ad let's see how it
122:21 - works
122:26 - see
122:27 - performance already looking kinda pretty
122:30 - right
122:32 - I mean at least for me
122:34 - okay
122:36 - so yeah that is one thing then we can
122:40 - have another thing
122:42 - here as called
122:46 - line
122:49 - that is simply say Center and see
122:53 - okay this should have been what I mean
122:59 - a line
123:05 - okay I don't know okay
123:11 - let's just simply say align text
123:15 - CSS mdn
123:20 - okay it's texture line
123:24 - so here we just simply write
123:27 - text align Center let's save it let's go
123:30 - let's see
123:32 - see I mean
123:35 - kind of looking very nice right
123:39 - so cool so there's one thing you should
123:42 - be able to very good at Google search
123:45 - for CSS I mean
123:47 - because
123:49 - uh these properties are like in
123:52 - thousands all right so you won't be able
123:54 - to you know
123:56 - learn about every one of them but you
123:59 - should be able to know like what you
124:00 - want to do like I know about here that I
124:04 - want to align my text somewhere so just
124:07 - simply write align text CSS right
124:10 - that's what you have to do there
124:13 - so I guess that was it for the
124:16 - introductory video of CSS uh so let's
124:19 - just quickly review what we talked about
124:21 - here
124:22 - we talked about CSS its reform why don't
124:25 - we use HTML styling over CSS then
124:30 - learn about linking CSS style sheet to
124:33 - our HTML then how basically we style
124:37 - everything
124:38 - we use the tag like body tag I use it
124:42 - um
124:43 - modified body the H1 tag and modified
124:46 - action
124:47 - like that okay in this video
124:50 - we are going to look at CSS syntax or
124:53 - you can say anatomy of
124:56 - CSS okay
124:58 - so in the previous video we learned
125:01 - about how do you know you can add CSS
125:03 - file inside your HTML file
125:06 - so just to give you a quick recap I'm
125:08 - just going to
125:09 - just going to put one index dot h
125:14 - tml here I'm going to add
125:22 - okay something is wrong
125:28 - yeah it's back
125:33 - okay we added the boilerplate here
125:37 - now uh what we did we
125:43 - create an index
125:46 - dot CSS and in here we have
125:53 - uh
125:59 - yeah link CSS the relationship style
126:02 - sheet and hrfs style.css okay
126:07 - okay I named it index.css so
126:10 - let's just change it to index.css
126:14 - okay
126:16 - now I'll show you
126:20 - how you know CSS syntax is written
126:24 - I mean I did show you in the previous
126:25 - one but let's see
126:28 - how like what is a breakage of it
126:32 - so
126:34 - you can say the breakage of Cs syntax is
126:39 - it is something like
126:42 - selector
126:45 - okay
126:50 - and then inside of it uh
126:55 - there is
126:58 - property
127:05 - and then there is
127:10 - um
127:13 - selection let's see
127:20 - okay
127:22 - and these are all in the curly brackets
127:28 - now see this selector this is basically
127:32 - who
127:36 - like who we need to change
127:39 - okay
127:42 - property is what
127:45 - that means okay we know what like who we
127:48 - need to change exactly or you can say
127:50 - which
127:52 - but what inside that selector we need to
127:55 - change so that is defined by
127:58 - property what
128:01 - and this tells us
128:03 - how much
128:05 - like what you want to change like if you
128:08 - want to you know
128:11 - give it a width how much width we want
128:15 - to like make it bold how much gold
128:17 - that is told by this selection
128:21 - what is sold by the property and who is
128:24 - stored by the selector
128:25 - now let's try and implement this a bit
128:29 - let's see how it works
128:32 - here I'm going to have an H1
128:34 - here I'm going to say
128:36 - in the text
128:38 - and then I'm going to have a p where I'm
128:41 - going to say
128:48 - paragraph text
128:49 - I go to my index
128:52 - and select who or what
128:55 - I want to change I want to change H1
129:00 - okay
129:01 - inside action what I want to change I'll
129:04 - just say let's say
129:07 - color
129:08 - how much or what should be the color
129:11 - here yeah let's say apple
129:14 - I'll just save it
129:16 - I order my index and I'll just click on
129:18 - collide
129:25 - so okay why haven't it been changed
129:39 - thank you
129:42 - it is index.ch says and here it is
129:48 - href is also index.css
129:51 - let's do one thing let's say it
129:54 - style.css and here we will use
129:57 - uh
130:02 - and rename it
130:09 - so hope it works
130:13 - okay that is weird
130:17 - Y is said not working
130:22 - I think ah okay my bad
130:27 - this dot not supposed to be here
130:34 - I'll like talk about why I added the dot
130:37 - and why it is not needed so basically
130:39 - when you write elements like H1 element
130:42 - of P element you want to
130:45 - you know change we just directly write
130:47 - them as I told you in the previous video
130:50 - but if you like suppose add something
130:53 - called a class here
130:56 - of H1 let's say
130:59 - then if you want to you know
131:01 - uh um modify this specific class only
131:05 - then you put dot okay it's not relevant
131:08 - right now but just you know telling you
131:10 - I mean this class would come in the
131:12 - future video so don't you know worry
131:15 - about it
131:16 - anyways we see you know
131:18 - what we change
131:23 - what inside that we change and by how
131:25 - much we change or what is that to change
131:29 - okay nice
131:31 - similarly you can have the paragraph tag
131:34 - as well let's see
131:37 - that looks nice
131:39 - let's see
131:45 - we can increase the font size
131:53 - uh learn two
131:59 - great
132:00 - so this was you know basically the
132:02 - anatomy of cases intact selector
132:04 - property selection to what how much okay
132:07 - so in the previous video we learned
132:10 - about the anatomy of CSS right
132:15 - then we talked about you know
132:18 - um
132:20 - the prop the values the selectors and
132:24 - everything and we looked at how website
132:26 - looks let's just
132:28 - Collide here
132:30 - HTML
132:34 - okay let's close that and let's go right
132:36 - now
132:38 - okay so this is what it looks like all
132:41 - right
132:42 - now
132:46 - um in the previous video
132:49 - we came up with a
132:51 - with the problem right
132:54 - so
132:56 - um what I wanted was to change the
132:59 - colors of these two decks right
133:02 - I wanted this to be in black and I
133:05 - wanted this to be an uh
133:08 - accordingly
133:10 - but when I use the
133:13 - see here so both of these would get uh
133:17 - the same color
133:19 - so here the conclusion that is right
133:23 - what to do now
133:25 - so since
133:27 - till now we have talked about uh
133:29 - selectors which are just tags like H1
133:32 - tag P tag all right
133:37 - but now we are going to look at more CSS
133:41 - selectors
133:43 - schools
133:51 - and you can see spot assist selectors
133:53 - you already know but let's read it again
133:55 - so uh
133:59 - basically selects the HTM element you
134:03 - understand
134:05 - all right
134:07 - now there are different type of CSS
134:10 - selectors
134:12 - okay uh you can divide the CSS selectors
134:15 - into five category
134:18 - so there are simple selectors then there
134:22 - are combinators pseudo class you do
134:25 - elements and attributes okay
134:28 - so if you go to combinator selectors you
134:32 - can see combinating something like
134:34 - expensive relationship between these
134:36 - characters
134:37 - so this would be I guess uh later
134:44 - too much for you
134:46 - okay
134:47 - so right now we are not going to talk
134:50 - about the combination one we'll talk it
134:53 - about any further coming videos
134:55 - but uh till then uh let's just talk
134:59 - about the simple selectors about in the
135:01 - simple selector we have only used the
135:03 - tag name okay
135:06 - so simple CSS selectors it contains
135:10 - ID
135:13 - and class
135:15 - okay
135:17 - so ID is used by a hashtag sign and
135:21 - class is used by a DOT okay we'll talk
135:26 - about how we'll do that okay
135:29 - and then there is a universal selected
135:32 - as well
135:33 - okay
135:34 - and
135:36 - the letters we talked about and yeah
135:40 - okay okay that is cool that is good
135:43 - right
135:45 - ah so let's just head back to our
135:47 - virtual Studio code and let's learn what
135:50 - we just ready so here we'll decide
135:54 - um ID okay
135:56 - and let's just name it
136:01 - and you will have a class which would be
136:03 - named black for now
136:10 - okay
136:13 - now here what uh we'll do we'll comment
136:17 - this so I hope you know what comment is
136:20 - so comment is basically
136:22 - a part of the code which is basically
136:25 - not
136:26 - executed or compiled so it is understood
136:30 - by the compiler that this is just for
136:31 - the documentation purposes and we don't
136:33 - need to compile this okay so it is by
136:36 - forward slash star
136:39 - and then you can have this chart again
136:41 - and forward slash
136:44 - okay okay
136:47 - that looks well
136:55 - okay let's talk about the universal
136:57 - directors
136:59 - the open Universal selector right
137:02 - now I'll just save it and then there is
137:05 - another
137:07 - warning okay
137:10 - now verified simply write uh
137:14 - font family
137:18 - on family is basically used for changing
137:22 - the font style so let's suppose with
137:24 - this right now
137:26 - back to save it
137:31 - okay battery only one
137:35 - okay
137:37 - [Music]
137:42 - okay okay okay okay okay okay
137:46 - [Music]
137:46 - um
137:55 - okay
137:59 - you don't see anything here but I don't
138:02 - know okay let's go here outside property
138:05 - okay that is
138:07 - in one
138:11 - on great
138:18 - uh
138:20 - let's just go back here you have saved
138:22 - it let's uh let's just go here
138:25 - okay let's just observe this now we'll
138:28 - go back to it again
138:31 - [Music]
138:34 - you can have
138:37 - sequence
138:43 - things happening
138:45 - [Applause]
138:48 - uh
138:52 - let's have it okay
138:56 - okay it is still not changing I'm still
138:59 - not sure why is that happening
139:01 - let's just go to the grocery schools
139:21 - okay
139:23 - let's try it for ourselves
139:25 - [Music]
139:29 - um you don't feel that
139:32 - there are the things why are we not
139:36 - having that thing
139:40 - yeah okay
139:47 - let's copy it from here
139:51 - and it's just PS2
139:55 - okay
139:56 - it's still not working let's just go to
139:58 - selector back again
140:01 - Universal selector is like this only
140:03 - okay let's just do one thing let's just
140:07 - try to put the color here for now
140:10 - and let's just say I'm not black let's
140:13 - say true let's hear it let's just go
140:15 - here
140:21 - uh
140:24 - [Music]
140:30 - this thing is working
140:33 - oh
140:34 - that's the blue color back here
140:38 - [Music]
140:40 - my family
140:52 - [Music]
140:57 - it's just
140:59 - try the point I'm leaving again
141:02 - or let's just separated okay
141:07 - you don't see that at all you can check
141:08 - the phone from everything on your own on
141:10 - your own system Maybe
141:12 - uh
141:16 - we'll see what it is all right
141:20 - so okay right never mind uh we're
141:23 - talking about friends so let's have one
141:25 - thing here uh
141:27 - let's have the class which was back okay
141:32 - and here we have the color as
141:36 - black okay let's save it
141:38 - and let's just have ID
141:43 - foreign
142:09 - what's the problem now
142:12 - okay
142:14 - let's save it
142:22 - this is in Black
142:25 - so
142:27 - both are the same paragraph type but
142:31 - ID and classes these are the main
142:33 - selectors you can you know
142:36 - um select and then
142:39 - uh code code snippet and style it
142:44 - accordingly all right
142:46 - so I guess the symbol collectors was all
142:50 - this video are in the next video we'll
142:52 - talk about the difference between class
142:54 - and ID and I welcome you all to another
142:56 - video of our web development series and
142:58 - in this video we are going to talk about
143:01 - Ides versus Plus
143:04 - okay so I hope you remember how we use
143:07 - class
143:09 - how we use class and how we use ID
143:12 - just to give you a quick recap
143:15 - uh we type class we give it some class
143:18 - name and we use
143:21 - dot for that
143:24 - okay
143:25 - and for simple
143:27 - like for ID views hashtag ID register
143:31 - for now okay
143:33 - great we can just remove everything from
143:35 - here and I'll remove this class as well
143:37 - we'll just start a fish
143:41 - let's see what happens
143:44 - okay simple nothing nothing important
143:46 - here
143:47 - okay great
143:49 - now
143:51 - you might think that
143:54 - okay idea like they have similar
143:56 - functions right
143:58 - but remember they are not the same and
144:01 - they do not always share the same
144:03 - purpose okay
144:05 - if I talk about
144:09 - um
144:12 - where's my star
144:17 - okay
144:19 - now what if I talk about IDs
144:25 - so first point is that each
144:32 - element
144:34 - can have
144:36 - only one ID
144:39 - okay
144:40 - suppose this is my header and there are
144:43 - two IDs let's say
144:45 - um samplement sample two
144:48 - sample one
144:50 - sample 2 and if I save it
144:55 - and let's just say I write hashtag
145:02 - sample one
145:05 - and hashtag
145:07 - sample two yeah
145:10 - this is how it would work right
145:12 - and suppose here I give it font size
145:17 - 1.5 REM
145:21 - and here I give it
145:26 - color aqua let's see
145:30 - now if I go back to the website and if I
145:33 - refresh see nothing happened why because
145:36 - each element can have only one ID
145:39 - according to our compiler sample one
145:42 - page sample 2 is a single ID both are
145:45 - not treated as different IDs
145:48 - so suppose if I write class here and I
145:52 - just
145:56 - now if I go back to a site see it
145:59 - changed right
146:01 - so that is one difference between them
146:03 - let's just put
146:05 - let's just leave it okay
146:08 - then second Point uh which would be here
146:12 - would be
146:15 - each
146:17 - page
146:22 - can
146:26 - only one
146:29 - element
146:32 - with that ID
146:35 - okay
146:37 - now this is like you can have like that
146:42 - okay let me just show you what I'm
146:45 - talking about
146:47 - it's intuitive
146:50 - okay hashtag sample two
146:53 - uh let's remove this part let's say ID
146:59 - okay
147:06 - okay if I go back to the website both
147:09 - are converted right but here what we
147:10 - said each page can have only one element
147:13 - with that ID
147:15 - but this
147:18 - is like a practice for us like this is a
147:22 - good practice for us I mean we should
147:24 - give only variety to one element okay
147:27 - it's not like you cannot use it multiple
147:30 - times you can
147:32 - but it was made for such a purpose all
147:35 - right
147:36 - okay I hope you understood that
147:40 - and
147:42 - what else is the difference
147:44 - obviously ID
147:47 - uses hashtag
147:52 - okay
147:55 - now if I talk about classes
147:58 - classes you know you can use
148:02 - same class or multiple elements that are
148:04 - in the practice we use dot in the class
148:10 - and you can use multiple classes on a
148:13 - single element not like this and classes
148:15 - are
148:17 - like there is a rule for writing class
148:19 - uh uh let me just say
148:25 - you can not have a class
148:31 - name with a
148:34 - space Act
148:35 - positive space con compiler would think
148:38 - that both are different classes which we
148:40 - just sorted here right okay
148:43 - so that was another example and
148:48 - play yes that was all the difference
148:50 - between IDs and classes
148:53 - like these three differences are there
148:55 - and one of these differences there
148:57 - okay and I'm again telling you this line
149:00 - each page can have only one element with
149:03 - that ID
149:04 - it is not a rule it is basically a
149:08 - practice which is used by most of the
149:09 - developers and you should
149:11 - follow the same okay
149:13 - so I guess that was all for this video
149:17 - hello everyone and welcome you all to
149:20 - another video of our web develop series
149:24 - so for the past few videos we have in
149:27 - talking about you know CSS we talked
149:30 - about the introduction to it
149:33 - we talked about the selectors we talked
149:35 - about the anatomy and few other stuff
149:37 - right
149:39 - if I
149:40 - just go live
149:42 - this is what our website looks like I
149:45 - mean
149:46 - we talked about different things here
149:48 - right so that is there
149:50 - so in
149:53 - this video or like I should say from
149:56 - this video onwards we'd be working on
150:00 - um website uh personal website basically
150:03 - I mean it's not going to be a simple uh
150:07 - TV website which we made there because
150:10 - they
150:12 - it was a very basic one right
150:15 - I mean if someone sees it they won't
150:17 - find it very attractive or anything like
150:19 - that
150:20 - right
150:22 - so
150:25 - that is there now let's go back to here
150:29 - and let's see what exactly we are going
150:31 - to make
150:32 - so this is one of the websites which I
150:38 - personally liked very much
150:41 - so this guy name is Sean helping all
150:44 - right this is his website
150:47 - and you can see this cover page it looks
150:49 - uh really nice here like see this is
150:53 - written here
150:54 - right
150:57 - um and you can see there are other users
151:00 - like it's a very neat website right
151:04 - there are different stuff here and there
151:06 - as well so yeah
151:09 - all in all there are many stuff which
151:13 - is available here okay so so in this
151:19 - video we are like try to imitate this
151:21 - website and make it our own
151:23 - all right so before we do
151:26 - we do that uh
151:29 - [Music]
151:32 - few things for me
151:34 - I'll just clear my sheets here
151:37 - okay first thing is
151:50 - just give me a minute
151:54 - okay I don't remember them
151:58 - let's go back here let's see how to add
152:02 - comments in HTML
152:05 - okay
152:08 - so this is the way
152:15 - all right
152:17 - so first step is uh
152:20 - create a new folder
152:24 - and writers
152:26 - my personal page
152:29 - okay
152:31 - then I want you to
152:34 - create an index.
152:37 - HTML
152:40 - okay then
152:41 - [Music]
152:43 - add color plate
152:47 - title
152:49 - your name whatever it is
152:53 - uh
152:55 - create
152:59 - style.css and
153:03 - link
153:05 - both of them
153:07 - and add
153:09 - blue
153:13 - background color so this is a task okay
153:17 - try and do it
153:19 - okay
153:21 - so for this you don't try to do whatever
153:24 - the steps I told you all right so here
153:26 - I'll go with my
153:28 - explanation We'll add the boilerplate I
153:31 - mean this
153:33 - this and this is already done with me so
153:37 - I just start from here I have added the
153:39 - boilerplate I'll just add the title
153:42 - so my name is
153:44 - so I'll just do that I'll save it
153:47 - and then what I have already likes I
153:50 - created this childhood CSS as well so
153:52 - you just do it on your own and then you
153:54 - have to basically link them so just
153:55 - laying
153:57 - and HFS style.css
154:01 - now here Simply Red body
154:06 - background color as
154:09 - blue saved
154:12 - okay
154:29 - my bad
154:31 - yeah
154:43 - okay so there's the shoes that we have
154:45 - successfully
154:48 - um created a sheet and linked them all
154:52 - right
154:53 - now now another thing I want to talk to
154:56 - you guys is
154:58 - um
154:59 - before going deep into you know making
155:02 - the site there's something I want to
155:05 - talk about as favicons
155:07 - so you can see here at the Sean's site
155:11 - got a little I couldn't write here
155:16 - right
155:18 - um
155:20 - so how to do that so what you have to do
155:22 - is write okay
155:26 - IO
155:28 - all right
155:30 - uh let's just go here
155:35 - let's have the text as yes
155:38 - right
155:39 - that works
155:41 - so this is 42 you know look like
155:47 - okay I will simply go and click on
155:51 - download
155:53 - so just showing folder
156:00 - um
156:02 - let's just try to open this one
156:08 - okay looks well
156:10 - if I open this one
156:13 - okay then what is this one exactly all
156:19 - right
156:20 - so what I'll do I'll just simply cut
156:23 - this
156:24 - all right let's go to the web def folder
156:26 - and I'll just paste it here
156:29 - I'll just save it okay now what I'll do
156:32 - I'll go here
156:34 - what I'm going to do I'll simply click
156:37 - on link this time link is not relative
156:39 - style sheet
156:42 - it's
156:44 - icon and it is
156:47 - right let's save it
156:50 - let's go here
156:52 - and you can see we got that beautiful
156:54 - icon right there with the name
156:57 - so you can have different things I mean
157:00 - you can
157:02 - go here you can add some emojis text PNG
157:05 - or something all right
157:07 - so that works now there is another thing
157:10 - that
157:12 - this uh
157:13 - might not work on some of the cases
157:17 - so what you have to do here is just
157:19 - change the relationship to
157:22 - favicon save it
157:28 - okay I mean see this would not work for
157:31 - me but it would work for you then all
157:33 - right
157:34 - and here what you have to do
157:43 - okay you might be wondering what is all
157:46 - this stuff so I would not go into detain
157:48 - over these things all right this is
157:52 - about basically the caching system which
157:55 - I don't
157:56 - uh thing is necessary for you to learn
157:59 - in this course so yeah
158:01 - here we go back
158:02 - now there's another thing you might see
158:04 - on Sean subsiders that it has got you
158:07 - know different divisions like see this
158:10 - division is a different thing
158:12 - then it got different divisions here and
158:15 - there and everything the positionings
158:17 - and everything
158:19 - I don't think so we have talked about
158:21 - right
158:22 - so in the next video we are going to
158:24 - talk about
158:26 - um how to you know add these divisions
158:28 - to which we can style differently and
158:30 - add
158:31 - different blocks in our code all right
158:33 - so many more to come uh in the next
158:36 - video so thank you for thank you for
158:38 - watching this video and see you later
158:41 - and I welcome you all to another video
158:43 - of our web development series
158:47 - so in the previous video we learned that
158:49 - we are going to make a new project on
158:52 - CSS along with it read learn a few
158:57 - Concepts as you will
158:59 - all right so if I do one thing if I go
159:04 - live
159:06 - we see what exactly I have with
159:11 - so till now we have you know basically
159:14 - made our
159:17 - boilerplate and styling sheet and Link
159:19 - them and
159:22 - to
159:24 - uh uh you know
159:27 - check uh
159:31 - the linking if it is right or not we
159:34 - have added a blue color right here
159:37 - okay
159:38 - so for now I'll just remove this look uh
159:45 - okay so now I just you know simply
159:47 - remove this
159:50 - all right
159:51 - so it is like this and then again one
159:55 - more thing was we have added an icon
159:59 - which is the fevicon which you can see
160:01 - right here okay cool
160:05 - now let's show one time let's try and
160:07 - implement this thing like
160:10 - what whatever is written here
160:14 - so you can see that this is an H1 and
160:16 - this figure
160:19 - paragraph
160:21 - so let's let's do the same thing here
160:26 - H1
160:31 - sure
160:34 - then let's write a paragraph tag
160:38 - a programmer right okay
160:44 - so
160:47 - okay uh as you can see here
160:51 - and if you see here
160:54 - in a different right
160:56 - I mean
160:58 - in this website it looks like the both
161:00 - are enclosed Inside the Box
161:03 - and if we see here it looks like they
161:06 - are very different right
161:08 - so what is different areas athletes so
161:11 - let's just things click on inspect and
161:14 - see
161:17 - because
161:18 - it is but if you can see there's
161:22 - something called div
161:25 - okay
161:28 - now you might be wondering what div is
161:32 - exactly right
161:34 - so we will just go Dev MDM
161:40 - okay
161:43 - so Dev basically stands for Content
161:45 - division element
161:48 - all right
161:57 - now it development is the generic
162:01 - container for flow content okay so it
162:04 - has basically no effect on the content
162:06 - or layout until styled in some way
162:10 - okay
162:13 - it might be a little confusing for you
162:15 - but let me tell you what they will
162:16 - exactly do
162:18 - so if
162:20 - I want to Club these two together
162:24 - what I use I use it
162:27 - so tip basically helps us to you know
162:29 - divide our content into separate
162:32 - containers so that we can affect the
162:34 - layout of each of the containers
162:36 - differently all right
162:38 - so what I can do here is
162:42 - I can write there
162:44 - right
162:47 - and I can simply
162:51 - paste it here
162:53 - but if you see
162:54 - not much of a difference
162:56 - you might be wondering oh what is this
162:58 - right
162:59 - but let me tell you
163:01 - uh
163:05 - the Sony mdl docs if it is
163:10 - that it has no effect until in some way
163:14 - CSS is applied
163:17 - so we need to apply a CSS right
163:24 - now before we talk about the CSS part I
163:28 - want to mention a few things right here
163:32 - uh that would be that then we think of a
163:36 - basically stands from this corner
163:39 - to this corner and its height is equal
163:42 - to whatever the content is inside that
163:44 - thing all right
163:46 - that is a very important point which I
163:48 - wanted to mention in front of you
163:50 - because in the future videos we'll talk
163:52 - about span and then we'll see what is
163:54 - the difference between span and a disk
163:56 - all right
163:57 - okay so let's try and give a very nice
164:00 - background color to our text okay so
164:03 - before that we'll just simply go to
164:06 - color paper
164:08 - CSS
164:14 - okay okay it's not like this it was I
164:19 - don't remember exactly
164:21 - uh what the site's name was
164:26 - okay but
164:28 - it had a very nice one let's let's try
164:32 - color palette pick up
164:37 - for
164:39 - HTML okay let's see
164:53 - okay I remember it was colorant right
165:01 - okay okay
165:03 - uh these are the basic uh you know a
165:07 - very nice color palette
165:09 - which we can use
165:14 - this one all right
165:17 - so I'll simply
165:19 - copy this color copy it
165:23 - I'll simply come here
165:27 - I simply say class equal to dedics
165:33 - okay whoops
165:36 - and here I say details
165:42 - and Dragons the background color as
165:46 - okay yeah
165:52 - see
165:54 - okay this color is uh
165:59 - so I think I'm gonna choose let's color
166:02 - maybe
166:06 - and sorry guys I'll uh configure a
166:09 - little bit I have actually a little bit
166:11 - download code
166:12 - not anything is serious but yeah
166:19 - and yeah this looks far better right I
166:22 - mean this is visible color like that was
166:24 - a nice color but it was not visible on
166:26 - the right background
166:28 - but anyways uh let's let's continue okay
166:31 - so this is uh
166:34 - now if you look closely you might see
166:38 - that there is a gap here
166:40 - this is the gap pill under the Gap here
166:43 - as a
166:44 - what is this Gap exactly
166:46 - I mean
166:49 - I will use Dev nothing above anything to
166:52 - the left but then to the right by itself
166:54 - this is because our web browsers have
166:57 - here
167:00 - old styling so they I mean if I go to
167:03 - it's not Pages sorry for that
167:08 - I'm going to give go to inspect
167:12 - mobile expanded like this
167:17 - [Music]
167:27 - is not able to find that right now
167:33 - okay
167:35 - but never mind you can see that there is
167:37 - a gap
167:38 - how to reduce it so this is a very nice
167:40 - trick which I'm going to tell you
167:43 - so
167:44 - listen to it carefully all right
167:48 - you don't have to do anywhere
167:51 - simply uh
167:53 - right quality
167:56 - and here
167:58 - have the marginal zero
168:02 - we don't have actual
168:05 - and here margin top has zero save it
168:11 - let's see how okay
168:15 - everything looks perfect right
168:20 - yeah
168:22 - then there is
168:26 - a line content to Center let's see if it
168:30 - works I don't know what shop
168:33 - it doesn't
168:36 - enter content of them let's see how we
168:40 - do a
168:45 - project text align
168:51 - let's say Center let's see if it works
168:54 - now
168:56 - okay this is a start I mean this looks
168:59 - nice to me at least I told about
169:01 - remember this looks nice to me
169:04 - uh we have done a lot of things till now
169:07 - and in the last video we talked about uh
169:10 - development
169:12 - uh this
169:14 - okay
169:16 - then we see a website it looks something
169:18 - like this
169:20 - pretty nice I'd say and then we go to
169:23 - this website says what we're trying to
169:24 - make okay
169:26 - now uh in this video we're going to talk
169:30 - about Box model
169:32 - okay
169:33 - now you might be wondering what is the
169:36 - Box Water right
169:39 - so
169:41 - let's go to outside let's try it back
169:47 - only Box model should come all right
169:50 - so
170:00 - uh yeah
170:05 - okay everything okay this is what is
170:08 - called a box model okay
170:11 - so in HTML every element
170:19 - its own box
170:21 - if I write a paragraph tag it would have
170:24 - its own box all right
170:26 - so a box basically has three main
170:29 - attributes one is padding
170:32 - one is the Border
170:34 - Anonymous margin all right
170:37 - so one by one uh
170:39 - we are going to talk about each of those
170:41 - boxes
170:43 - and
170:46 - then we'll try to you know do something
170:52 - on our own to see how
170:57 - we see it all right if it makes sense to
171:02 - you
171:05 - okay
171:11 - so first we'll talk about the Border
171:15 - okay
171:16 - let's come here let's see what we can
171:19 - have
171:21 - uh okay we will draw it
171:24 - let me draw it suppose this is my box
171:27 - this is my development
171:29 - okay
171:30 - now this div element uh
171:35 - would have some border
171:38 - right
171:40 - right if I go here it would have some
171:42 - border
171:43 - where I
171:45 - now what would it look like
171:49 - because because there are some border
171:51 - like this
171:53 - okay
171:56 - anything in closing it
171:59 - it's called it
172:00 - border okay
172:03 - I hope it was a bit clear to you I held
172:06 - you
172:08 - okay
172:11 - now let's try and implement it let's see
172:13 - how it will look if you see it you would
172:15 - get it
172:17 - uh remove pattern understanding mode
172:20 - right away
172:21 - you know I order write solid and
172:27 - then we say
172:29 - order
172:33 - let's suppose
172:37 - okay
172:40 - I have a color as well that's I declare
172:43 - out this
172:45 - looks let's go to work right
172:54 - [Music]
173:01 - [Music]
173:03 - okay
173:05 - why can't you see the Border here
173:09 - okay since there goes the whole part
173:12 - let's have a height
173:15 - of 200 pixels for now
173:19 - and uh width of 200 pixels
173:25 - oh let's see
173:27 - we got it
173:30 - um yeah
173:35 - [Music]
173:37 - let's do one time let's see background
173:41 - color too
173:45 - black
173:48 - okay okay so the color was
173:51 - actually equal to the background color
173:53 - right now
173:54 - so that's why you couldn't see it but
173:56 - this is the background I mean the Border
173:58 - you're talking about it raise of 10
174:00 - pixel
174:01 - highest color is black
174:04 - all right as it all and you can see the
174:07 - same thing is happening here okay
174:11 - now do you think which we'll talk about
174:14 - is uh adding
174:17 - so suppose there's some content written
174:20 - inside a box
174:23 - so
174:24 - the
174:26 - difference between the content and these
174:29 - both edges
174:30 - mean difference
174:34 - or that edge or this Edge or message
174:40 - it is called
174:45 - padding
174:48 - okay
174:54 - it is called padding
174:57 - so what uh we are going to do is
175:04 - we are going to
175:07 - have a padding here
175:10 - here
175:14 - [Music]
175:18 - of currently pixel let's save it
175:23 - [Music]
175:23 - um
175:32 - [Music]
175:36 - you can see that there's a padding
175:38 - around it
175:40 - I mean this is the content
175:43 - okay oh you might wondering
175:47 - okay there's not much of a change here
175:49 - what is the difference right
175:53 - that is what you might be wondering
175:56 - okay
175:58 - okay so let's just try to remove the
176:01 - body for now let's save it
176:04 - so let's see
176:06 - okay I can I see I mean I guess maybe it
176:10 - is different than me
176:13 - [Music]
176:17 - so guys simply add the padding
176:24 - there we go
176:29 - on demo
176:31 - then we go to border
176:33 - and the only thing that I've left is uh
176:36 - we need to talk about is uh module
176:41 - so margins
176:46 - a buffer zone okay
176:49 - it is this you know uh
176:52 - the test current element and any other
176:56 - element that is on our screen
176:59 - or suppose
177:04 - there is this box out there let's call
177:07 - it the Box only and the distance between
177:09 - them
177:13 - that is called the
177:16 - [Music]
177:17 - um
177:22 - okay
177:25 - so I hope
177:28 - this was
177:30 - clear to you
177:34 - okay
177:40 - hmm
177:43 - no
177:45 - okay so I told you about margin now
177:48 - there's one task which I would like to
177:50 - give you
177:53 - um
177:57 - okay so first thing you have to do is
178:02 - make one more container
178:06 - with the
178:10 - height
178:12 - and
178:17 - that as
178:21 - 200 pixel only okay then the second
178:24 - point would be
178:27 - uh to give it a red color
178:35 - the third thing would be
178:38 - change
178:40 - first I mean
178:45 - assign class to
178:47 - boot details
178:53 - then try
178:56 - or if you can't rewrite it but for now
179:00 - that is all you have to do okay
179:04 - so yeah I'm going to uh okay uh we can
179:08 - just change it to let's say
179:13 - first container
179:17 - so yeah
179:18 - and you will have class five
179:24 - second container
179:26 - and let's save it
179:28 - let's change it to
179:36 - let's go to the website to see if it
179:38 - working if it's working it is working
179:43 - now let's add
179:50 - second container
179:54 - we have high dashboard pixel we have
179:57 - with uh 200 pixel what else
180:02 - uh background color will have your
180:06 - okay let's do it let's see how our side
180:09 - looks now
180:12 - okay
180:14 - now one more thing I don't know if you
180:16 - might uh
180:19 - seen it or not but this is a total pixel
180:21 - box this is a 200 pixel box
180:24 - where is the difference make
180:27 - why am I getting uh so much High
180:30 - difference
180:33 - we'll talk about it
180:37 - [Music]
180:40 - this works
180:42 - it's easier inside container and
180:45 - everything the address to One Direction
180:49 - but because of the padding which is you
180:52 - know twenty twenty two hundred percent
180:53 - twenty that is 240
180:57 - then I talked about the border that
180:59 - would be 10 10 260.
181:02 - so that
181:04 - makes it greater than I mean it's
181:07 - because it the box size isn't
181:10 - compromised when we had the padding or
181:12 - when we are at the border
181:14 - all right even when we add imagine a box
181:17 - size is not compromised okay so please
181:19 - see that in mind
181:21 - okay okay
181:24 - so anyway next thing we had to do was
181:26 - just introduce margin here
181:33 - now let's hit the table so yes
181:39 - um
181:41 - all of the sides there's there's this
181:45 - we are now separate margins as well
181:49 - um
181:52 - [Music]
181:57 - let's save it
182:00 - see I've got it from here
182:05 - no that's why I put the margin top of
182:09 - temperature as well
182:15 - between them becomes 20 pixel
182:19 - okay
182:20 - so this was the Boss model uh we had to
182:25 - talk about
182:26 - there
182:29 - we immediately had
182:31 - three mutants adding border and margin
182:36 - so far we have learned a lot of things
182:38 - right let's go live and see
182:41 - uh uh okay okay uh I've had let's close
182:46 - this
182:48 - um let's just go back here
182:50 - stop this for a while go to HTML and
182:54 - then we go live
182:56 - yeah Okay cool so we have like developed
183:01 - kinda few things right
183:03 - so far okay cool
183:05 - uh now the question arises uh exactly
183:12 - that our site is not looking like the
183:16 - Sean's
183:17 - site
183:19 - right
183:23 - I mean let's say it looks something like
183:26 - this
183:28 - which uh clearly doesn't
183:31 - so okay we'll try and do few things here
183:35 - to make our website look something like
183:39 - this let's go to style
183:41 - okay in the first container what I
183:43 - wanted just remove the border with and
183:45 - Border color for now
183:48 - okay
183:49 - okay then we have textile and background
183:51 - color okay rest all the things are fine
183:55 - okay
183:58 - something is still there which we don't
184:00 - want
184:02 - uh width is there let's move it let's
184:08 - let's have the padding
184:11 - let's remove the margin let's move the
184:14 - margin from here as well let's save it
184:19 - let's remove this solid border also
184:23 - let's save it
184:25 - okay
184:28 - um kind of works right
184:30 - I mean
184:32 - I can have the
184:35 - wet okay let's not have the bit right
184:38 - now okay
184:40 - cool
184:42 - okay now uh one thing I want to show you
184:45 - is
184:47 - uh this is my development project in the
184:50 - image I have two images
184:53 - uh one is cloud
184:55 - okay looks like this
184:58 - and one is Mountain which looks like
185:00 - this you can download your old images
185:02 - from the
185:04 - all right I the way I did it
185:09 - all right
185:12 - uh now I get back to here uh what I want
185:16 - here is
185:18 - I'll go to simple HTML
185:21 - um in the
185:23 - this part
185:27 - um
185:28 - I have this uh two sentences and below
185:32 - this sentence I want an image tag okay
185:35 - Source would be
185:38 - images
185:42 - scale nothing like this what is this
185:46 - Images slash uh let's have the cloud one
185:50 - let's save it
185:51 - we'll have
185:54 - Cloud image okay
185:58 - and
186:01 - similar thing we'll have here as well
186:10 - okay
186:11 - and then below this uh we'll have same
186:17 - mountains and we'll save it and we'll
186:20 - say
186:23 - Mountain image for now okay okay works
186:28 - let's see how it looks
186:31 - uh definitely we are looking for
186:36 - uh what is wrong here exactly
186:42 - um let's just remove the height as well
186:44 - now let's see
186:47 - okay okay
186:52 - and another thing which we can have here
186:55 - is
186:59 - uh sorry yeah here is let's remove the
187:04 - text Line to Center as well okay
187:08 - okay let's save it
187:10 - just give me a minute
187:16 - okay this this looks uh nice and I I
187:20 - mean we have the images not looking nice
187:22 - okay
187:23 - it's looking very houses now you might
187:25 - be wondering why one thing is
187:28 - um which I don't know is bugging to you
187:30 - but it is bugging to me is I have this
187:33 - Cloud here and then I have the sentences
187:35 - but here I have the cloud and
187:37 - adjacent to it is the mountain image
187:40 - so what is these what is this thing
187:42 - exactly what is the difference here
187:44 - okay so the diff uh I mean
187:49 - differences because of the display
187:52 - okay let's now go and try to read the
187:54 - display so display is a CSS property
187:57 - which sits within an element is treated
187:59 - as block or inline okay and the layout
188:03 - is used for okay that is something
188:05 - different but what you should be know is
188:07 - how it is seated block or inline
188:10 - let's just click here block or inline
188:14 - uh
188:18 - okay they don't have it here I'll just
188:20 - tell you what is the blocker and what is
188:21 - an inline
188:28 - okay
188:30 - suppose
188:32 - here I write H1
188:35 - hello world
188:40 - H1 okay
188:43 - now if I
188:46 - have the color as red
188:56 - I mean it is World here and it should be
189:00 - like uh
189:03 - background color
189:09 - here you can see that this I mean the
189:13 - text is here but it is taking the whole
189:15 - this thing
189:17 - right so what is this called
189:20 - so this is basically called a block
189:24 - element which you know blocks the whole
189:26 - uh area
189:28 - not just the text all right
189:32 - similar thing is the
189:34 - paragraph tag as well
189:36 - para have to say
189:39 - and we'll just close it with this
189:43 - okay okay
189:45 - okay
189:47 - then
189:49 - I have the power attack I will
189:53 - back crown
189:56 - color let's say
189:58 - blue
190:00 - okay
190:02 - so you can see
190:04 - block elements you know blocking the
190:06 - whole area
190:08 - right
190:10 - so that is one of the displays called
190:13 - block okay
190:15 - another of the display is called uh span
190:18 - ah sorry another three displays called
190:19 - inline an example of a line could be a
190:22 - span okay now I'm wondering what is a
190:25 - span so let's just try writing span
190:29 - okay
190:31 - I mean
190:32 - yeah
190:33 - I'll simply write
190:35 - hello
190:37 - world again
190:39 - and I'll just close this fan
190:42 - okay
190:45 - and I'll just have this thing I'll have
190:48 - the background color copied from here
190:50 - only
190:53 - another space set
190:56 - okay
190:57 - great work right I mean you can see that
191:00 - uh span
191:02 - is an like if we write span and if we
191:05 - try to format it it is not you know uh
191:08 - encapsulating the whole block it is only
191:10 - encapsulating the
191:11 - content written inside it so this type
191:14 - of display is called inline display
191:17 - okay
191:19 - create create
191:21 - now you might be thinking like okay span
191:24 - is working fine then why do we need a
191:26 - block display elements I mean what is
191:29 - the need there
191:31 - so need is there I mean suppose I want
191:34 - the width not to be changed I said
191:38 - 100 pixels
191:41 - right but suppose I want the width here
191:46 - to be
191:47 - 100 pixel
191:50 - it has 100 pixel width right so that is
191:54 - the thing here okay
191:57 - oh you mind wondering okay everything is
192:00 - working fine everything is cool
192:03 - all is good but
192:05 - the thing which is bugging me is if I
192:08 - want to use the powers of both
192:10 - um block and ni what can I do
192:12 - so CSS gives us the ability to adjust
192:15 - our display okay
192:18 - I just
192:20 - simply write display and I can write
192:25 - inline
192:28 - see
192:30 - cool trick right
192:31 - so this brings me to the third type of
192:34 - display which is
192:37 - in
192:40 - line ok
192:47 - here you can adjust the height
192:51 - let's say 100 pixel
192:55 - see
192:56 - so this gives you the advantage of both
192:59 - the cases all right
193:01 - so this is how you can see that how
193:03 - elements are you know adjusted in our
193:07 - web page using CSS okay
193:10 - uh the Box model contributes to it the
193:13 - display contributes to it and a few
193:15 - other things which we'll talk about it
193:18 - so I hope you learned something in this
193:20 - video about
193:22 - the display the blog display inline
193:25 - display online block display
193:27 - and one more uh very uh
193:32 - what should I say
193:33 - informative
193:37 - tag which is the span tag all right so I
193:40 - guess that was all for this video and in
193:42 - the previous video we learned about
193:45 - um
193:48 - uh elements of like block elements and
193:51 - inline elements and how we can you know
193:53 - change the position
193:55 - okay
193:57 - and what else uh we talked about the
194:01 - positioning as I mentioned
194:04 - uh all right
194:06 - and
194:09 - and did we talk about anything else no
194:11 - that was it okay
194:14 - so in this video we are going to talk
194:15 - more about how you know we position the
194:19 - element exactly okay
194:21 - so but before we do so the first thing
194:24 - we have to realize is that even without
194:26 - CSS
194:27 - an HTML element has some positioning by
194:31 - default okay
194:33 - and we have to understand how things you
194:35 - know get positioned by default before we
194:37 - can go and change it to bend the rules
194:39 - okay
194:42 - so the first rule is that content is
194:47 - everything
194:48 - okay
194:50 - suppose here I have a let's say I have a
194:55 - diff
195:01 - uh hello
195:05 - and here I have a span
195:13 - okay
195:15 - and if I write the div
195:25 - let's do this
195:27 - and
195:29 - I have this one let's see
195:42 - okay
195:50 - so we can see that okay in div in Span
195:54 - the content is like this okay it just
195:57 - encapsulates the whole content
195:59 - in the table also like it's fine that
196:02 - the it has the whole block like this but
196:04 - the height is in accordance to the
196:06 - element only
196:08 - so that's why the first rule is that
196:10 - um content is everything all right
196:13 - the second rule I would say is children
196:16 - sit on parents
196:18 - okay
196:20 - now I'm wondering what I mean by that
196:22 - exactly
196:23 - so suppose I just remove the hello from
196:25 - here
196:28 - okay
196:30 - and here I have
196:34 - height say 100 pixel
196:41 - and let's say
196:44 - with 100 pixel as well for now
196:53 - okay
196:55 - and if I have this pan
197:00 - inside this div so div is a parent and
197:03 - span would be the child
197:06 - all right so you can see that our span
197:11 - or a child sits on the parent
197:13 - right so that is what children said on
197:16 - the parents mean so these are the basic
197:18 - two rules of positioning okay
197:21 - now uh we can also you know set CSS
197:24 - property like
197:26 - other than the positional thing
197:31 - okay
197:32 - uh I mean other than this position or
197:35 - nothing
197:37 - um
197:39 - like the default position thing we can
197:42 - also write a CSS property which is
197:43 - position property in order to position
197:46 - elements on okay
197:48 - so basically there are two position
197:49 - properties static and relative
197:54 - so let's talk about the static so okay
197:57 - we have talked about this article
197:58 - because this default HTML thing
198:01 - I'm in positioning of how how how this
198:04 - would be positioned how this would be
198:05 - positioned how this would be positioned
198:07 - is
198:08 - um simple static
198:11 - um all right
198:13 - and if I talk about the relative one uh
198:16 - relative positioning is uh basically how
198:20 - uh you would you know
198:22 - a positional element relative to how
198:24 - absolute it was
198:26 - okay
198:28 - I don't know if it made sense to you but
198:30 - let's try something and then
198:33 - we'll be able to
198:35 - I guess would be able to get it what I'm
198:39 - trying to say here
198:40 - so okay I'm giving you a task make three
198:45 - divs of a square diff of 100 by 100 and
198:51 - give them colors of red blue and yellow
198:52 - okay pause the video and do it
198:55 - oh yeah meanwhile I'm gonna do it
199:03 - let's say the
199:07 - class has read
199:11 - okay
199:39 - okay
199:41 - this works right now let's just
200:03 - now let's have the blue one
200:07 - let's do something let's just copy this
200:10 - thing
200:12 - and we'll just paste it
200:14 - uh change the color to Blue
200:18 - okay
200:21 - and let's uh
200:27 - let's paste it change the color to
200:32 - yellow okay okay cool
200:36 - now suppose I changed the
200:41 - position to
200:43 - um sorry
200:46 - position to relative
200:50 - okay
200:52 - and now I put the top to
200:56 - 20 pixels
200:58 - you see this element
201:01 - be here according to the it's static
201:04 - position
201:05 - but
201:06 - since it is a relative position it would
201:09 - you know shift to 20 pixels downward
201:11 - from the top
201:14 - uh whether friends to the absolute
201:16 - position and the one of the major thing
201:19 - is
201:21 - that other elements would still be at
201:24 - their absolute position
201:26 - so if I simply just say 100 pixels
201:31 - good you know come down here and the
201:34 - other element would just you know
201:39 - uh
201:41 - vanish okay so this is all that we have
201:46 - to talk about the positioning absolute
201:48 - answers and how default positioning is
201:50 - done by HTML okay
201:53 - so far in the couple of previous videos
201:56 - you learned about the positioning of
201:59 - elements in our
202:04 - um website right we learned about inline
202:08 - elements we learned about block elements
202:10 - we learned about inline block element
202:12 - we learned about the fixed position and
202:15 - the absolute position and the relative
202:19 - position all right
202:20 - so let's do one thing let's go live here
202:24 - and try to see what we have achieved so
202:26 - far okay okay let's remove this red box
202:28 - I don't know why it is still there
202:34 - now let's see uh Okay cool so this is
202:38 - what our website uh looks like currently
202:41 - okay
202:43 - now
202:45 - uh one thing which
202:47 - I think we can have is all we can have
202:50 - all these elements towards the center
202:52 - right
202:53 - that is one of the bare minimum
202:56 - so to do that we have text align as I
203:00 - told you which we can have in the body
203:03 - all right let's hit enter
203:06 - let's see how it looks hmm okay great
203:11 - now one thing I want to tell you is if
203:15 - we inspect it
203:17 - um
203:18 - yeah you can see that all the text
203:22 - uh which are aligned or I mean see it's
203:26 - just as a cloud
203:28 - okay let's have it
203:31 - I mean other than the image all the
203:33 - things which are aligned like this
203:39 - so these are basically the uh block
203:43 - element
203:44 - all right like they have the full block
203:47 - like this right
203:50 - the whole inline thing is right
203:52 - suppose
203:55 - um
203:56 - I change the width
204:00 - to
204:01 - 10 percent
204:03 - now what will happen
204:05 - see
204:06 - as soon as it gets upload it becomes a
204:08 - block element
204:10 - um
204:11 - yeah it becomes a block element the
204:14 - texture line uh don't work on it
204:17 - so what is like what can we do here
204:21 - what we can do here is we can have the
204:24 - margin
204:25 - top would be zero uh right would be Auto
204:28 - bottom would be zero and left will be
204:31 - orders
204:32 - okay now if you check it uh this is how
204:35 - you Center
204:36 - all right so this was all uh about you
204:41 - know centering how is internal element
204:44 - so these two are the main methods by
204:46 - which we can Center the element all
204:48 - right all right so I'll just
204:50 - [Applause]
204:50 - [Music]
204:51 - um
204:52 - removed from here for now
204:57 - [Music]
205:00 - let's check
205:02 - back to what we had
205:05 - okay
205:06 - great
205:07 - now another thing which you might be
205:10 - noticing is that this mountain is not
205:13 - flying in the center because of um
205:17 - This Cloud
205:18 - right
205:20 - um
205:20 - This Cloud basically is like a hindrance
205:23 - right
205:24 - so we have to you know remove this uh
205:28 - cloud from the HTML flow
205:32 - so whenever I uh remember how we take an
205:36 - element of of the HTML Flow by changing
205:38 - one particular CSF property
205:42 - and yes that is of course the position
205:44 - property that we are going to change
205:48 - all right
205:50 - um now let's try to
205:55 - see uh what we can change here exactly
205:59 - okay
206:02 - let's do one thing uh
206:05 - this is the cloud
206:07 - [Music]
206:07 - um
206:09 - I'll give it a class
206:11 - call
206:13 - bottom Cloud okay
206:18 - uh let's move this is good
206:22 - and I'll say bottom
206:26 - cloud and simply I have this position
206:31 - absolutely
206:39 - why there is
206:45 - no difference here
206:50 - okay okay okay
206:53 - hmm
206:56 - this is our first container so
207:01 - let's have the uh position
207:06 - here as
207:08 - related
207:10 - okay
207:12 - and let's have the
207:15 - left of what
207:24 - okay
207:27 - [Music]
207:28 - um
207:31 - 50 victors okay
207:38 - okay I'm not sure why this thing is not
207:42 - working
207:44 - uh
207:51 - um
207:55 - there is a probably sometime which we
208:00 - are missing
208:04 - um what can it be
208:08 - what is that one thing
208:12 - which we are nothing
208:16 - let us check the name if it is correct
208:19 - it's bottom cloud
208:22 - okay
208:27 - I mean one of the most reading mistakes
208:30 - but
208:31 - okay
208:33 - okay I mean uh
208:37 - it is uh something not one thing you
208:42 - want but it is okay
208:43 - but this is because we don't
208:46 - he should not be having what should not
208:49 - be happening
208:51 - uh suppose I just say
208:55 - 10x what difference would it bring let's
208:57 - see
209:00 - okay let's say 300 because
209:04 - um
209:05 - okay
209:08 - and left me I'll say 300 pixel
209:12 - okay
209:14 - right
209:18 - so yeah
209:19 - okay let's have it
209:22 - 400 pixel
209:25 - looks pretty nice right so my next
209:27 - challenge will be
209:29 - to
209:31 - ha let's make it 400 as well
209:34 - let's see how it would look I mean it
209:36 - depends all on you okay not 400 400 will
209:40 - look nice
209:42 - let's say 350. now let's see let's see
209:47 - okay I mean for me it works
209:50 - I mean I can have it to 330
209:54 - okay that works for me that was really
209:56 - fine for me
209:57 - okay now I want you I want to give you
210:00 - guys a challenge to move this
210:04 - uh
210:08 - I'm Legit forgetting the words right now
210:13 - but yeah let's move this Cloud somewhere
210:17 - here okay
210:18 - let's have some padding over here
210:22 - right uh first container let's have some
210:28 - adding top let's handle pixel
210:32 - you see
210:54 - let it work
210:55 - Ed on holding
211:00 - let's see clear scenes back let's see
211:03 - while we're working
211:04 - [Music]
211:07 - Cloud I should be adding here
211:11 - [Music]
211:11 - um
211:16 - okay
211:18 - we're having some baggage
211:22 - okay we'll talk about the body thing
211:25 - later but
211:26 - um I'm glad like you understood and just
211:28 - try to move this from here to here
211:31 - somewhere
211:33 - hmm
211:37 - so what what what we can do is
211:43 - uh we can have
211:48 - classes
211:49 - [Music]
211:54 - okay
211:57 - what about because we kind of closed
212:00 - there obviously
212:04 - a cloud
212:07 - [Music]
212:08 - um
212:13 - we have the position
212:17 - again as
212:19 - absolute
212:23 - um what we can have more would be
212:27 - let's have top of papers right
212:35 - and I'll write as
212:40 - okay
212:43 - let's see how it looks
212:45 - okay
212:47 - where this mountain is a little bit far
212:49 - so we should be having this model a bit
212:52 - far as well
212:53 - so let's have a left task in pixel as
212:57 - well
212:58 - works okay
213:01 - so now you guys tell me how it looks
213:05 - I mean for me it looks better and I a
213:08 - little bit
213:10 - um what is this
213:12 - uh let's write show
213:18 - okay it's looking a little bit like this
213:20 - right so okay that's a good start
213:25 - on the next video we would be trying to
213:27 - change the font here because because of
213:31 - the positioning changes sometimes it
213:34 - should
213:35 - see all about in the next video hello
213:37 - everyone and I welcome you all to
213:39 - another video of our web development
213:41 - series and in the last video we learned
213:43 - about the what I call this Dark Art of
213:47 - centering
213:49 - elements using CSS all right we did it
213:52 - using two methods and we learned about
213:56 - um
213:57 - what we say uh
214:00 - absolute positioning as well and if I go
214:04 - live
214:05 - this is what my website looks like it
214:08 - looks pretty neat to me at least all
214:10 - right
214:10 - so I mean I'll give that to me that this
214:15 - looks nice
214:18 - okay
214:23 - uh now what I would be going to talk
214:28 - about is these texts right
214:31 - uh which I already talked about
214:34 - how to I mean
214:37 - I am going to talk about them right
214:44 - so
214:46 - yeah
214:48 - let's let's uh just start with that all
214:53 - right
214:55 - great okay now there are basically two
214:59 - phone families one is
215:04 - a difference between settlements answer
215:06 - is these tiny legs which are present in
215:09 - the serif but are present in these
215:10 - answerers
215:11 - okay
215:13 - now let me let's just try with the
215:15 - example
215:17 - let's have one family
215:21 - there kind
215:24 - a lot
215:28 - but uh main are
215:32 - sensor
215:35 - let's see how it looks
215:37 - okay where is my website who gets there
215:40 - so we'll see
215:42 - there are no little legs there and there
215:44 - so there is that
215:47 - then we have Sarah let's see how it
215:50 - looks
215:51 - see the little X
215:53 - okay then what else we have we have one
215:56 - space right
216:00 - I mean monospace has
216:03 - every letter have you know like equal
216:08 - gap between them
216:10 - then
216:12 - [Applause]
216:14 - let's see
216:16 - I mean it looks a bit terrible right
216:20 - and there is one fantasy as well if I
216:24 - remember correctly okay this looks
216:26 - really bad
216:28 - so these are the basic font families
216:30 - then
216:31 - um we talked about science events array
216:33 - so sansar event serif has basically
216:37 - like these upon families so there are
216:39 - definite fonts present in them right
216:43 - so
216:45 - let me show you some things
216:48 - let's say for family I will say
216:53 - uh cancel it for now let's see how it
216:56 - looks it looks like it okay
216:59 - then there is
217:02 - [Music]
217:07 - under the
217:10 - fan serif only
217:13 - and it looks something like this okay
217:17 - so
217:18 - I okay one more thing is
217:21 - uh
217:23 - you are seeing all these things right
217:25 - like you might be wondering okay what
217:27 - the hell is this right
217:30 - okay
217:36 - so you might be a little bit uh short
217:40 - Thriller but I mean the first time when
217:43 - I read about it
217:45 - I was true okay so this is basically uh
217:50 - all these fonts may or may not be
217:53 - present on someone's computer
217:56 - I mean
217:58 - see it's not present on megaboot I mean
218:00 - uh this one is present on my computer
218:03 - but
218:04 - there is a high possibility that this
218:07 - might not be present on yours
218:10 - all right then what would happen
218:14 - look for this if not it would look for
218:17 - this if not it would look for this and
218:18 - if not silencer refers I mean it is
218:21 - right about that
218:23 - so this is you know a safely by versus
218:27 - like being very specific and love being
218:30 - very gentle
218:31 - okay so let's start
218:35 - that is all we have to talk about the
218:38 - porn family now another very pretty
218:41 - thing which I want to talk to you guys
218:44 - is I mean suppose
218:47 - you are a person who is very specific
218:50 - and won't start whatever font you are
218:53 - seeing on your screen should be visible
218:54 - to the other person
218:57 - so how to do that
219:00 - okay
219:02 - so I would recommend you to go to phone
219:05 - sort Google
219:08 - okay
219:14 - google.com let's see
219:29 - [Music]
219:42 - okay
219:46 - [Music]
219:51 - I don't know exactly
219:53 - [Music]
219:57 - full
220:02 - let's see
220:05 - yeah let's try to get an alternator
220:07 - let's go to font awesome
220:09 - [Music]
220:12 - I don't wanna learn right now
220:25 - I'm not able to find it
220:29 - where did it go exactly
220:57 - let's try
221:05 - let's check
221:07 - okay it has been there what what was I
221:12 - even doing here
221:14 - okay phones.com uh you can search it

224:36 - so that of all I have to talk about
224:40 - default all right
224:42 - so I hope you like this video you
224:43 - learned a lot through this and I hope
224:46 - you apply this in your budget as well so
224:48 - far we have learned a lot of things
224:51 - right
224:52 - and I mean you know
224:55 - basics of CFS then
224:58 - learned Advanced or I would say
225:01 - intermediate CSS as such
225:04 - which included a lot of things
225:06 - okay
225:08 - in centering data difference between
225:12 - them and span
225:14 - and how to style a text okay
225:18 - so in order to you know style our text
225:21 - or to change the text property and go to
225:24 - exclude more ways of
225:27 - silent attacks we have to have more
225:30 - content on our website okay
225:33 - uh if you go live right now
225:38 - this is what our website looks like but
225:40 - we need more content here all right so
225:43 - what to do
225:45 - okay
225:46 - so I have something for you
225:51 - [Music]
225:51 - um
225:52 - let's just close it yeah okay I have
225:55 - something for you
225:57 - code file
225:59 - all right
226:01 - I'll put the description in the uh sorry
226:06 - I haven't delete all this thing in the
226:08 - description and you can download it from
226:09 - there
226:10 - so you don't want them you open it
226:15 - and
226:18 - what we are going to do here
226:21 - left contains something like metal
226:24 - container and okay whatever content you
226:28 - want to do you just copy it
226:32 - and Below first maintainer just paste it
226:41 - okay
226:43 - so
226:46 - yeah that is what you have to do and
226:49 - let's just save it
226:52 - and let's see what else it looks like
226:55 - okay
226:58 - now your momentary what is this right
227:01 - so this is some
227:03 - text which we have here
227:07 - okay
227:09 - here we put in information of ourselves
227:13 - and I
227:16 - tell you what we'll put but first of all
227:19 - let's try and understand what is like
227:21 - everything written here
227:23 - so in the Metro container what we have
227:25 - we have a profile
227:27 - you can add your image here or any image
227:30 - you want and then we have a Hello and
227:32 - then we have this Laura mixed symptom or
227:34 - something something
227:36 - so it is a very I have to create time to
227:39 - tell you what it means
227:42 - let's just write our website
227:47 - and
227:52 - it's taking a bit
227:54 - okay
227:57 - I mean I don't know hydrogenics was so
227:59 - much time
228:00 - we'll get through one thing let's go to
228:02 - settings
228:04 - and let's just change the search engine
228:07 - to Google
228:09 - okay and now let's
228:12 - okay it hasn't changed why let's see
228:16 - let's go together and
228:20 - okay
228:31 - but
228:34 - foreign
228:52 - and there you have something
228:55 - close it and close it from here and
228:59 - let's go live
229:02 - go ahead and get back and here you can
229:06 - see what is Laura lips um it is it's a
229:08 - tummy text from the printing and typeset
229:10 - Industry
229:12 - Okay so
229:15 - what happens basically is when you
229:16 - design a website
229:19 - um you know that you would have be
229:21 - having some content over there like you
229:23 - would be having some content over here
229:25 - or some content over here some content
229:26 - over here
229:27 - but
229:29 - what exactly you don't know at that time
229:32 - so
229:34 - to happen so you have Tamil content
229:38 - uh over like as a placeholder and later
229:41 - you can you know just modify it
229:45 - uh
229:50 - printed on the placeholder all right
229:54 - so
229:56 - that is there all right
230:00 - now let's let's do one thing let's try
230:05 - and add some
230:07 - photos here
230:09 - I mean there's a very famous website
230:12 - called Flat icons where you can get
230:14 - Vector images
230:16 - okay
230:19 - and there are like hundreds of icons
230:25 - just go on
230:27 - V1
230:30 - and you can see like there are hundreds
230:33 - and hundreds of icons present here
230:37 - and you can choose any one of them so
230:39 - suppose I go with
230:42 - Avatar
230:47 - job description looks fine
230:51 - I go over here what I do
230:54 - [Music]
230:54 - um
230:56 - let's pick this photo let's just
230:59 - download the PNG
231:16 - it has downloaded right
231:22 - okay go in a folder
231:26 - so what we'll do is
231:28 - copy it if you go to our web page
231:32 - in the menu folder we just
231:35 - place it
231:38 - okay
231:40 - looks great
231:41 - now what we'll do we'll come back here
231:45 - in the middle container in this
231:49 - you can have
231:51 - images
231:53 - this is my PG let's save it let's see
231:56 - how the website looks now
231:59 - okay
232:01 - I mean uh before me needing this you go
232:04 - for picture
232:05 - who will try a little bit
232:09 - let's just say class
232:14 - circles
232:16 - allow okay
232:18 - we go to our style
232:20 - and
232:25 - here I have a good
232:28 - okay and
232:32 - I have the modern radiograph uh 50
232:36 - percent
232:41 - all right now find me the website
232:46 - hmm
232:48 - okay
232:52 - monetary
232:54 - okay okay it was a good straight
233:03 - it has got a round figure but it's not
233:07 - much of a round so let's say
233:11 - okay
233:12 - let's have the
233:15 - width as 100 pixels and
233:20 - why it has 100 pixel as well now let's
233:23 - see how it looks
233:26 - hmm looks nice right
233:30 - and instead of this you can any other
233:34 - image you can find on the flat icon
233:38 - and you can just simply paste it I mean
233:41 - just copy the image here
233:43 - okay okay great
233:46 - similarly
233:48 - um
233:53 - We Have Skills section as well okay I
233:57 - have a skills photo here like let's say
234:00 - I go back here
234:09 - okay
234:10 - which I'm liking I'll just simply here
234:13 - coding
234:16 - [Music]
234:22 - I'm like nothing
234:30 - okay this is not something I would be
234:33 - needing
234:35 - I have to do something from here so
234:37 - let's say I choose
234:39 - this one looks like I'll just download
234:42 - it
234:47 - what I'll do I'll go in the folder
234:53 - okay show my folder
234:57 - uh I just cut it and
235:05 - I'll just paste it over here
235:07 - and I saved and I'll
235:10 - um
235:11 - close it
235:13 - now here what I have uh
235:18 - here I have these four images
235:23 - file extension
235:25 - and make love
235:29 - answer circles I'll save it
235:31 - now let's see what it looks like
235:34 - I mean it looks amazing to me at least
235:37 - we have some other picture over here
235:39 - like whatever you want but for now
235:42 - I have the
235:44 - same one okay
235:48 - and
235:53 - create
235:55 - now
235:56 - okay looks amazing
236:00 - and then the
236:04 - last container
236:06 - we have contact me phone type
236:09 - where you can mail to wherever you want
236:13 - let me just type in my mail ID
236:25 - okay
236:27 - then in the bottom container you can
236:28 - have different links
236:30 - and here you can have a name and surname
236:32 - as a copyright thing
236:35 - that is attend my name
236:40 - now if I go back to my website this is
236:43 - what we have got so far I mean we can
236:45 - increase a bit over here
236:50 - let's say
236:52 - 200
236:56 - let's say we create
236:58 - if that looks amazing right
237:01 - now this is me so I would put my photo
237:04 - over here you can have a photo here you
237:06 - can give a small introduction over here
237:08 - for now I have just GTA me text was I'm
237:11 - just showing it to you right
237:13 - and again same text over here something
237:16 - something here
237:18 - then get in touch something some things
237:21 - will be something then contact me mail
237:25 - your
237:27 - social profiles uh URL you can have
237:31 - in your copyright photo so
237:35 - I've got a lot of content over asking
237:37 - now which we format or change the
237:41 - properties
237:42 - in the upcoming video
237:44 - and in the previous video we
237:47 - copy the code from the subco file which
237:50 - I
237:52 - I told you in the previous video
237:56 - okay now if I click on go live
238:02 - uh we can see that we have got something
238:06 - here
238:08 - play
238:10 - we have got the
238:14 - content now we can try and talk about
238:18 - them
238:19 - all right
238:20 - now one thing I want to talk about you
238:23 - guys is on science okay
238:25 - suppose I want this thing to be the
238:29 - created suppose
238:32 - okay
238:35 - I mean I want it to be more greater than
238:37 - everything like move it around the H1
238:40 - standard size
238:42 - so that
238:44 - like because you
238:46 - ultimate heading thing all right so what
238:49 - what that what we'll do what we'll do is
238:52 - we'll go here
238:54 - in this one I am going to have
238:58 - alt file
239:00 - 90 pixel
239:05 - why is it up let's say 50 pixels
239:11 - great it looks a lot bigger and
239:14 - everything
239:16 - uh
239:20 - uh if I say 0.3
239:25 - okay
239:26 - so it looks a lot nicer right
239:30 - create
239:32 - but uh we have like mentioned it in
239:36 - pixel but there is one another
239:41 - um
239:42 - Dimension em
239:44 - before talking about em let us see like
239:47 - what is like why don't mean pixel
239:52 - suppose I go to settings
239:54 - I go to appearance and in the font size
239:57 - which is the medium which is recommended
239:59 - I click on large
240:02 - now if I come here
240:06 - uh you'll notice okay let's do it very
240:10 - large
240:13 - be great so one thing you might have
240:15 - noticed is 5 of this text has not been
240:19 - changed by size of this text
240:21 - I got this checked everything has
240:23 - changed so cool right click on the
240:25 - medium now you can see that yeah but
240:28 - here the size is not inch
240:30 - why is that because
240:33 - when we declare a font size and pixel we
240:38 - have like fixed that thing okay like
240:40 - that in the static value
240:42 - to have it in and dynamic we use em okay
240:47 - so let me tell you what is em first so
240:51 - El
241:03 - okay
241:09 - um sound
241:12 - of M so in uh previous
241:17 - uh Time
241:20 - 1 em was equal to
241:23 - yes and
241:25 - five
241:27 - or l
241:30 - okay
241:31 - but in the modern days
241:34 - one
241:36 - em
241:37 - is equal to 16 pixel okay
241:43 - now if I change this part
241:46 - because I want it to be
241:49 - an enemies by 16.
241:53 - which would come roughly to 5.625
241:59 - here
242:02 - okay
242:04 - do that same size okay create everything
242:07 - let's cook
242:09 - now another property I want to talk
242:11 - about
242:13 - um
242:14 - EMS
242:18 - um if someone have one size here but one
242:21 - size is a basically no derived value
242:23 - suppose here
242:25 - will be body I have a font size of
242:30 - 2 am
242:33 - and there are so H1 inside body H1
242:37 - parent is body right if I have font size
242:41 - in the body and if I have a font size in
242:44 - H1
242:45 - this font size would become equal to
242:48 - 5.625 plus just 2 okay
242:51 - so if I go here you can see okay it
242:54 - looks very very right
243:02 - all right
243:04 - but there is not a very you know like
243:07 - this is a small code so you can see uh
243:10 - check whose parents have got what size
243:12 - but in big codes it is very hard to
243:15 - debug this thing
243:18 - so in order to have this value to be on
243:20 - its own and not to be derived
243:23 - we use something called
243:26 - REM okay R stands for root so if I put
243:31 - this value
243:32 - great so are you basically impact it is
243:36 - gonna add the font size present in the
243:40 - body I mean in the parent part all right
243:43 - great so I guess we talked about font
243:47 - size here
243:49 - and there's one of the most uh important
243:53 - and crucial parts we should be known
243:55 - between different pixels EMA and Ariens
243:58 - all right so okay
244:01 - and so far
244:03 - um let's look at the website which
244:06 - we have created uh look something like
244:10 - this where
244:11 - it looks nice right
244:15 - oh great okay something
244:19 - um
244:21 - I want to have you there is in the body
244:25 - let's remove this
244:28 - it's looking too big but that right now
244:32 - if I go here
244:33 - yeah
244:34 - it looks much smaller than you
244:37 - better okay okay great now I would like
244:41 - to in this video uh try and
244:46 - [Music]
244:46 - um
244:48 - have a skills and some nice way okay I
244:51 - mean to format it you know
244:55 - so for formatting uh one thing I would
244:59 - like to have is
245:01 - let's have the inspect
245:06 - okay uh Lindy class row you can see that
245:11 - we have two divs for two different
245:16 - eight anymore
245:19 - great
245:22 - now since it is like having the whole 50
245:27 - I mean 100 width I wanted to change the
245:30 - width to 50 okay this is your first
245:33 - challenge for the video and try it
245:36 - okay now if I talk about if I want to
245:39 - try what I'll do is I will go on scale
245:42 - through
245:44 - make sure it matches the name here
245:48 - okay
245:50 - and here you can have with us
245:56 - 50 save it
245:58 - and see how it looks okay
246:06 - holder you can see
246:08 - it has a 50 percent is left
246:12 - great now another thing which I wanted
246:16 - to
246:18 - send but Center these shapes in the
246:20 - matter
246:21 - for that we learned about the margin
246:28 - let's say Auto let's save it
246:32 - in the margin I mean at a fancy Center
246:36 - but I'm not liking this part all this
246:40 - space I need to have some spacing so try
246:43 - another 100 pixel margin
246:47 - on top and bottom and leave the left and
246:50 - right to uh
246:52 - Auto
246:54 - so pause the video and try it so if I
246:58 - have to do it what I'll do I'll write
247:00 - 100 pixel
247:02 - and if I go clockwise it would be right
247:04 - so Auto and then again bottom would be
247:09 - 100 pixel and then again would be Auto
247:12 - if I save
247:15 - how would it look
247:17 - hmm I mean I got the margin here and
247:20 - here so it looks pretty wings
247:22 - now another thing which I want from you
247:25 - guys is to have this text
247:28 - in the left part not in the center part
247:32 - so here we have the text align effector
247:34 - but here I want to have the text
247:35 - aligners left
247:38 - for that you know you can simply write
247:40 - text line left and what it would do it
247:43 - would override they are text line
247:47 - to feel so if I look at it
247:52 - looks something like this okay great
247:56 - now now what else
247:58 - what else is and you can see that
248:02 - there's no much space here right
248:04 - so what to do on this thing like I want
248:08 - to have some space here
248:10 - so what we can have here is
248:15 - we can have uh line height or two
248:21 - okay you can see the difference see
248:23 - there is some like line height
248:26 - difference and it looks uh
248:28 - pretty better than before okay
248:35 - okay one thing I didn't tell you in the
248:38 - previous video you can use these
248:39 - stickers but show you the lots are they
248:43 - can be used here
248:45 - go to Jiffy or click on be animated
248:49 - and here you can write code
248:53 - okay
248:56 - for the green
248:57 - and click on the second spot
249:01 - let's see what stickers we can get from
249:05 - here
249:09 - fight is a bit slow
249:17 - [Music]
249:24 - if I click on scales let's see what it
249:27 - shows me
249:31 - [Music]
249:35 - um
249:36 - okay
249:38 - I don't know why I got the images are
249:42 - not
249:44 - opening
249:46 - okay
249:48 - but
249:50 - um okay there's a lot of thing at all
249:53 - I don't know what the problem is
250:02 - see it at the end of the video we'll see
250:05 - if the stickers get loaded we'll try and
250:07 - inculcate it otherwise we'll go with
250:09 - this image cool so far we have formatted
250:14 - our skills set a bit
250:16 - but
250:18 - I want to do one time which would look
250:21 - totally cool
250:23 - but it is not right now so I want to
250:27 - wrap these texts
250:29 - around here
250:32 - okay and then I should be here and this
250:34 - text should wrap it or somewhere around
250:37 - here
250:38 - how to achieve that
250:40 - so for that let me just reduce it to
250:47 - say 25 percent
250:51 - okay and Here Also let's do 25 percent
251:03 - I don't know
251:06 - I mean obviously we cannot activate but
251:08 - let's see hey looks nice
251:12 - so for that what we do is we
251:16 - learn about uh
251:19 - new answer called float
251:21 - okay
251:23 - just go float CSS
251:26 - property
251:28 - and see what it is exactly
251:31 - so close property specifies whether an
251:33 - element should float left right or not
251:36 - at all
251:37 - all right so absolutely positioned
251:40 - elements ignore the flow property so
251:42 - rather than seeing any running with
251:46 - Theory let's go for B
251:48 - uh learning it in Practical all right
251:51 - float
251:56 - and I feel like
251:57 - and if I save it
252:01 - but how is float day
252:17 - okay
252:18 - that's why we had a problem
252:21 - foreign
252:48 - it's back okay
252:52 - okay uh pretty much not what we need
252:57 - not getting the correct among stickers
252:59 - here I would say
253:01 - let's just say I recorded we'll let it
253:04 - go on its own can we come back here what
253:07 - we will do we will have some
253:11 - other class here let's say
253:15 - kill
253:17 - image
253:19 - and here also I'm going to have 12
253:24 - image okay
253:26 - and if I go here what I'll do I'll have
253:31 - till
253:33 - image okay
253:35 - I have these two things
253:42 - and then I'm going to have root left
253:45 - okay
253:48 - only through one time I'll have skill
253:51 - image one and climate Studio I'll tell
253:54 - you why I am doing this
253:57 - let's see
254:00 - so this is what I was talking about see
254:03 - if all texts are
254:06 - wrapping this
254:09 - text around okay but I see that there's
254:12 - no Gap here so how to have a gap here
254:16 - so what we can do we can simply have
254:19 - uh margin
254:23 - from the left of 100 pixel
254:28 - okay not from left from right
254:40 - great now see
254:44 - looks nice right
254:47 - now
254:48 - like new comments for you would be to
254:51 - have this part
254:54 - to something similar like this but this
254:55 - image should come here and the text
254:57 - should be somewhere here
255:00 - we get an image okay
255:02 - cool so can you do that for me try it
255:06 - so what you can do is you can do skill
255:09 - image
255:11 - to
255:13 - you can have these things
255:17 - okay and in the float you can have
255:22 - right
255:24 - okay and margin
255:27 - and on the right should be
255:31 - 50 pixel now let's see
255:35 - create okay how awesome does this look
255:38 - right the MySQL section is looking
255:40 - something like this and another parts
255:43 - coming here like
255:45 - looks really great right
255:48 - and one more thing which we can have and
255:51 - we can have this color on all the paths
255:54 - that would look great
255:56 - right okay we want something how about
256:00 - this
256:03 - suppose I just copy that I just
256:06 - came here
256:09 - and from here if I please set and save
256:13 - it
256:14 - let's see did we get it
256:17 - three
256:19 - doesn't it look wonderful right
256:23 - you can have some other image on the
256:25 - second part as well
256:27 - uh what say what's I would say
256:30 - I mean this looks nice
256:32 - and just copy this
256:36 - uh don't tell me
256:39 - we have to wait again but okay we can
256:42 - wait and by the end of this lecture
256:45 - I mean two or three minutes and we can
256:47 - get these sequence so let's wait for
256:49 - that time
256:51 - but okay we want to have this color here
256:55 - so what we'll do we'll check watercolor
256:58 - was
257:01 - required steps
257:04 - you simply copied and put it in the
257:07 - background
257:10 - it looks nice to me at least
257:13 - and I hope you guys also make it
257:17 - great
257:19 - um
257:23 - so many images but yeah
257:26 - you can add this one
257:29 - if I

257:45 - when you it's not looking very nice over
257:48 - here right
257:51 - so let's
257:53 - move that image let's have some other
257:55 - image
258:02 - so we can do one thing you can have the
258:05 - Border radius I have let's say 60
258:07 - percent
258:09 - and let's have that see it now yeah
258:12 - looking much better okay
258:15 - so so far I mean I'm liking what have
258:19 - done
258:20 - and we learned about the float and
258:24 - we learned about you know these stickers
258:27 - which we can use
258:29 - great we learned our report property as
258:31 - well
258:32 - so yeah I mean
258:35 - that move it
258:39 - which I wanted you guys to know here
258:44 - all right and one thing which
258:49 - we can have this
258:52 - between the
258:54 - here we can have
258:57 - HR tag okay
259:01 - great
259:03 - and
259:11 - okay I'm not getting
259:12 - [Music]
259:16 - okay let's see what which are thickness
259:19 - how we can have HR
259:22 - click and CSS
259:26 - let me go to Charcoal move check uh
259:30 - then
259:38 - height add one pixel let's say
259:43 - char
259:50 - and see
259:53 - okay nothing much happened
260:02 - let's try and just copy this part let's
260:05 - see how it would look
260:09 - foreign
260:31 - all right let's click on go live and see
260:33 - what we have created so far
260:36 - so
260:39 - okay great
260:40 - so this is what it looks like right nice
260:45 - now I want to uh you know I've planned
260:50 - something that this video and next video
260:54 - most probably
260:55 - uh we'll have you know I'll uh walk you
260:59 - uh through this like site or through
261:02 - some styling which I'm going to do
261:05 - and I would highly recommend you to you
261:08 - know follow me along this these two
261:10 - videos
261:11 - we are talking about minute menu changes
261:14 - which you are going to put on our site
261:16 - to look at more presentable than it is
261:20 - right now
261:21 - all right
261:23 - so yeah let's let's try and do this
261:29 - great
261:32 - cool
261:34 - now uh
261:37 - before I talk about anything
261:40 - um what I want is
261:42 - uh right now I want your text color to
261:47 - be a little grayish okay
261:50 - I mean you can see the text color it is
261:52 - little black but if it is a little
261:53 - grayish that I could look cool right so
261:56 - the code for that would be four zero
261:59 - um
262:00 - 514 e
262:03 - okay
262:04 - I save it I go and I see yeah I mean
262:09 - it's not much of a change but it looks
262:12 - nice
262:13 - all right
262:14 - and then on H1 and H2 I want a little
262:18 - different color
262:20 - you can have any color of your choice
262:22 - but what I am thinking is a little of
262:25 - aqua
262:27 - okay
262:31 - our non H2 I am thinking of having the
262:35 - same
262:37 - okay on H3 as well
262:47 - great
262:49 - now if I go back
262:51 - hmm looks nice right
262:56 - [Music]
262:59 - uh what else we can have here is
263:07 - okay
263:09 - now
263:12 - um
263:13 - we go dehyde and everything
263:20 - now what I want is to have a gap between
263:24 - these two I mean this cap and you know
263:28 - this Gap there's no gap between you know
263:30 - bottom container and middle container
263:33 - middle container and top container so
263:34 - put the Gap I am going to go on the
263:39 - uh what have I named it here
263:42 - middle container right
263:44 - so I don't think I have any middle
263:46 - container here so I'll just have
263:50 - one middle container
263:53 - it is filling okay that's fine
263:58 - okay let's try and try the middle
264:01 - container
264:03 - we'll go for margin we want top margin
264:06 - to be hundred pixel we don't want any
264:08 - left margin so it would be Auto
264:10 - bottom margin would be 100 pixels and
264:12 - then again Auto
264:14 - great
264:16 - now if we go back
264:18 - looks nice right
264:20 - now one more thing I want is uh
264:26 - here we have
264:28 - class are so good if I check what is so
264:32 - good
264:34 - this is fine but I want to change the
264:36 - height as well
264:38 - let's say net pixel
264:42 - okay loaded Holland pixel
264:45 - let's remove this
264:47 - let's have with 500 pixel
264:51 - height and 100 pixels now let's go and
264:53 - see
264:54 - okay it looks a bit small
264:57 - so let's make it 200 now we go check
265:01 - perfect
265:03 - great
265:05 - looking nice right
265:12 - now another thing which I want
265:17 - would be
265:19 - I mean c
265:21 - this route I it is a single long line it
265:25 - is not looking nice at least not to me
265:28 - so what I am thinking of doing here is
265:31 - like I'll give it a class
265:35 - I'll say intro I save it and here
265:40 - I'll have a intro
265:44 - and here I'm going to have width as
265:48 - let's say 40 percent
265:50 - let's save it let's see
265:53 - okay look fill looks better but we want
265:57 - to be on Center so here we'll have the
266:00 - margins as Auto
266:03 - and yeah this is how it looks it's nice
266:08 - agreed
266:10 - great great great great
266:14 - uh what else we can have here is
266:31 - okay
266:37 - no no no no what else uh we can have on
266:41 - our website
266:43 - to
266:44 - make it look
266:46 - better
266:49 - like kind of thing okay we can change
266:52 - this this long line doesn't look nice
266:55 - so for this thing we are going to try
266:57 - something
266:59 - okay this is a standard code so just
267:03 - uh we not remember it but try to
267:06 - understand it okay
267:08 - we're going to have dotted
267:11 - we are going to have a thickness as X
267:14 - pixel
267:16 - and here we have color which would be
267:18 - Gray
267:21 - would look like and let's save it
267:25 - if I go that looks something like this
267:27 - it looks not very nice but it is what it
267:30 - is
267:30 - now the Border bottom
267:33 - has to be zero because we want only
267:35 - single line or none
267:39 - okay if I go
267:41 - single line
267:43 - I don't want so many dots
267:47 - so I can have with uh like four percent
267:52 - that would work
267:56 - okay looks nice
267:59 - and
268:01 - margin here should be
268:06 - 100 pixel from the top
268:09 - 0 pixel
268:12 - Auto from the left
268:15 - 100 pixel from the bottom
268:19 - and auto from the right let's save it
268:22 - let's see
268:23 - okay
268:26 - looks nice right
268:28 - yes great work great work
268:31 - now okay I'll give you a challenge like
268:36 - this has been made
268:39 - I want you guys
268:40 - do it exactly what we did here okay
268:44 - so
268:47 - I would like
268:49 - um suggest you guys
268:52 - to
268:54 - try this thing
268:56 - okay
268:59 - this would look nice
269:03 - so try it
269:06 - okay
269:08 - if I go here I check in the bottom
269:13 - what is there
269:15 - as such no class has been assigned to it
269:18 - so we'll assign a class
269:21 - bottom
269:28 - okay
269:34 - and
269:36 - you are going to have Dot
269:39 - bottom
269:41 - this is what I have written
269:43 - okay great
269:47 - now
269:49 - this was the code I copy it and paste it
269:52 - here save it
269:54 - if I go back
269:59 - looks nice right
270:02 - but it doesn't have you know or
270:06 - I mean the whole margin is auto that's
270:08 - why I guess
270:10 - the problem is so let's do one thing
270:14 - let's have Auto
270:17 - 100 pixel Auto
270:20 - and let's see it now
270:23 - okay
270:26 - let's have it at 60.
270:31 - hmm
270:33 - let's have it as 40.
270:44 - 40 pixels sorry
270:47 - yeah looking great
270:48 - right
270:50 - now the last thing I want you guys to
270:54 - understand in this video is
270:56 - we have to change this contact me button
270:58 - okay for that we have something CSS
271:04 - button generator
271:07 - okay if you go to this website you can
271:09 - have your button as your own
271:12 - okay
271:13 - now here I want not click me but I want
271:17 - contactly
271:19 - font is five
271:21 - or we can have this one you can choose
271:24 - your own color
271:29 - we
271:31 - for me this would look nice
271:34 - it hasn't changed
271:49 - okay font size fine
271:53 - box everything's fine border I would
271:55 - like to change it to
271:57 - 8 so that it gets a square shape all
272:02 - right
272:03 - and
272:05 - background
272:11 - this works fine
272:13 - however I don't answer we need anything
272:16 - in the hover part
272:19 - okay
272:21 - so let's
272:23 - just copy this whole code from here
272:27 - okay and then we are going to paste it
272:30 - here
272:32 - simply just paste it
272:34 - now you go to HTML and you see your
272:39 - I mean it has button only
272:42 - so if we go to a website now I'll see
272:45 - button okay great
272:47 - looks nice right
272:49 - now you can change the color here on
272:52 - your own
272:53 - pose
272:55 - I want to have the same color which we
272:58 - are having here
273:00 - let's just copy it and
273:04 - just try and paste it
273:14 - okay
273:17 - I mean color is different I don't think
273:20 - we can find it but three
273:22 - color is different right
273:25 - so yeah so I mean we have
273:29 - I mean we did a lot of things in this
273:31 - video
273:31 - okay we had some
273:34 - height I mean patterns we have this
273:38 - cute little dots
273:42 - we made this contact me button we
273:45 - centered the textures like this and
273:48 - everything so yeah everything looks cool
273:50 - so I guess that was all for this video
273:53 - at least and in this and if you remember
273:56 - in the previous video we styled our
273:58 - website
273:59 - Google
274:04 - let's see
274:06 - okay uh my bad let's just close this
274:10 - just go back here don't show again
274:14 - and now let's play
274:17 - okay
274:19 - we added these underlines
274:24 - and what else
274:26 - we added this button okay great now one
274:29 - thing which I did was I changed the
274:33 - color
274:34 - of our lower part two simple white and
274:38 - this part of t one which was there
274:41 - previously okay
274:43 - so in this video all we are going to do
274:46 - is we are going to talk about the footer
274:48 - part
274:49 - in order
274:51 - challenge put a part one thing
274:55 - uh that is concerning me here practice
274:58 - but it looks little out of place right
275:00 - because of the font so what can we do
275:05 - simply we can do one thing
275:08 - um style.css
275:17 - or you just copy this and
275:22 - yeah we are just going to paste it and
275:25 - save it on now but it looks pretty nice
275:31 - no uh if we have to format the footer
275:35 - part so it's class with bottom retainer
275:39 - so we have bottom container
275:44 - and here I'm going to have my
275:49 - um
275:50 - background color I have six
275:54 - um
275:55 - call background color
276:01 - uh background colors
276:06 - yeah nice
276:08 - this is the same color which we are
276:10 - using for the font
276:14 - um
276:17 - it looks something like this nice oh one
276:21 - thing you must what is this that you can
276:24 - see this thing we have the map why is
276:26 - that
276:27 - already told you that
276:30 - web pages by themselves sign Auto
276:34 - margins
276:36 - so how to cover that exactly
276:41 - we can cover them with
276:44 - adding
276:46 - so let's have a top adding a 50 pixel
276:49 - okay
276:52 - um
276:55 - left radical zero bottom parting is 25
277:00 - [Music]
277:02 - and and left adding a few
277:05 - okay and we'll see looks nice
277:10 - so it is there
277:14 - now another thing which I want to change
277:15 - is these uh
277:19 - anger tags
277:21 - so what we're going to do is call the
277:23 - anchor attacks
277:27 - let me explain
277:29 - yeah okay so for the anchor tags what we
277:32 - can do here we can first of all change
277:33 - the color of the text
277:37 - to let's say one one
277:42 - okay now if you go back
277:46 - you can see it looks nice you need a
277:49 - little
277:50 - same to the color but I actually prefer
277:53 - this when using the links all right
277:56 - now you can see that we have these
277:59 - underlines
278:00 - which I don't want so these underlines
278:02 - are as you know
278:04 - already provided by a
278:06 - HTML for the Android apps
278:09 - to remove that we can
278:13 - use the text decoration
278:17 - so let's uh text integration of let's
278:21 - say
278:23 - okay
278:25 - great now uh there is no gap between
278:28 - them so let's put some gap between them
278:33 - it's full Gap you know we have to put
278:35 - the margin let's have the top margin of
278:37 - Centerview uh right margin of 25
278:45 - if I go back and look
278:47 - yeah looks looks better rate
278:53 - the only thing left is to have the phone
278:55 - family
278:57 - we are going to have this phone family
278:58 - only
279:01 - and we'll save it
279:05 - now
279:08 - sorry yeah it looks pretty nice right
279:11 - the only thing which is left is I don't
279:15 - I mean a few user comes on the website
279:17 - he won't be able to recognize that what
279:19 - is this
279:30 - right I hope you remember that if you
279:33 - can just switch over and watch the
279:35 - videos so we
279:39 - have this thing over we
279:42 - never ordered I want the color to be
279:45 - more a bit wide
279:47 - shadow fight which is e a f
279:51 - 6 S6
279:54 - okay now
279:57 - you want to look and you see
280:00 - look great all right
280:04 - already know what to do right
280:09 - left is
280:11 - to have the copyright part
280:17 - so for that let's just
280:21 - see if we have something okay we don't
280:24 - have any
280:25 - plus so let's add a
280:30 - class here
280:31 - let's name as
280:34 - copyright
280:36 - okay and let's
280:42 - our copyright
280:46 - 20 okay
280:48 - now first of all I want the color so we
280:52 - can have the same color
280:55 - uh the white one looks pretty neat
281:00 - looks nice right
281:02 - now I want this text to be reduced the
281:06 - contrast will be reduced it's a 0.6
281:11 - 75 am
281:15 - okay
281:17 - 3 4 of 16 pixels
281:21 - right so it looks nice bit small
281:25 - and I wanted to be at the bottom so to
281:28 - get it at the bottom
281:30 - I have to have padding
281:35 - so
281:37 - padding will be what
281:41 - we go bottle retina the bottom padding
281:44 - is 20 pixels
281:45 - so we can have the upper binding of some
281:47 - difficult as well then right zero pixels
281:51 - [Music]
281:55 - and save it I mean let me check
282:00 - and it looks nice right
282:07 - so well I guess that was on which we

Cleaned transcript:

now before starting I would like to tell you what all we will do what we would be looking in this series would be ready okay yeah okay we're looking at HTML CSS we'll be looking at JavaScript and we would be looking at real ideas we'll be looking at node.js and we've been looking at Expressions okay so and values we also you can get mongodb okay oh yeah this is all what we are going to do we are going to be adding here okay hmm no you might be wondering what all these are like what did I just you know say okay so we don't have to worry much about it foreign and as soon as you hit react these are basically uh you know essential languages and framework to learn front and web depth okay good now what does frontend exactly means front end regularly means what you see on the web okay I mean whatever you see on the web that is fantastic and node.js XPS and mongodb these you know compressors are backend okay cool okay let me just you know complete it back kick okay now this is what you know you submit a form or you know uh like if you look at Amazon you submit a purchase or you know you buy something then how that detail is tracked the details thread using putting all these things foreign so now let's start with the very first lecture yes okay now we will learn how you know web works exactly okay so um let us ask you what is internet so the very basic definition is internet is Network network of Network okay now what does this exactly means it means that um I have this box okay I have this another box I have this another box and I have this another box these boxes are exactly called servers okay and these you know contain different uh what do I say um web pages or you can see the websites all right and all these are you know interconnected just need to to there just need to do this this might be connected to this this might be connected to this might be connected to this and this might be getting ready to do this like this so this whole web this is called internet it is basically network of it okay I hope this was clear to you okay now next second question to you is how exactly do you uh access Internet okay this is a very basic version I mean everyone has access internet I mean you've seen this thing on YouTube so that means you have an access internet and okay so internet is you know basically accessed using web browsers okay now my wondering what is a web browser right so I guess you might be having Chrome on your website or you know Safari or brainwash anything like that these are called web browsers Chrome Safari wave and even fireworks eight these are called web browsers we have you basically you know go to the um and you access the internet over here right see here I am using uh Google Chrome so that is my web browser how View actually internet okay now what is you know a web page where you go to Chrome you open a website you come across a web page okay so what is a web page now that is my next question now if we talk about what a web page is our webpage is nothing but just HTML CSS and JavaScript code which is rendered okay understood I mean you write some code of htmlcs and JavaScript somewhere not somewhere on your IDE right and this code is basically rendered and that is how what I mean the rendering part is what you see on your web page okay good now uh if you have little basic idea you would be named what these three are used for so HTML is basically used for structuring over a thread okay it gives us a like it is a skeleton over that page okay this is used for notification now to add colors to add font and to align objects that is why CFS is used foreign what happens suppose if you click a button what would happen there would be some alert okay and if you hover over something like if I over here see uh something is written there like 10 black thickness three so this is all I got how JavaScript like this is all done by JavaScript okay now see you cannot use CSS alone okay if the I mean it is very obvious right you know to use JavaScript alone as well I mean that is also very obviously but you can use HTML always alone right cool so HTML is a building block of a web page now so in this tutorial we would start with HTML again you know go what is HTML and you look at some of the web pages then you would understand about HTML tags and you know deformed and everything and in the end of the build and HTML uh website a simple HTML website as a project okay so first of all before we dive deep into HTML code I will want you guys to um see what HTML so HTML basically stands for hypertext markup language okay so what you understand by this thing I have a text these are like Fortune support and what to do with them okay so you would break this thing into two parts and that's how you would be able to uh what do I say understand it better okay cool so first what is hypertext that second one is cool so um what is hypertext okay we would understand what hypertext is actually right so let's open a web browser and look at this website and if you don't know what this is so this is the first website ever created okay all right so it was just a worldwide web info and everything you can see these things subjectively like uh in the blue color these are basically hypertexts all right I mean if I click on any of these because I click here I will be redirected to some other page if I click here I will be redirected to some other page right click here I would be redirected to other page yeah yes okay so basically interlinking as well okay I mean these are very old that's right so in the name of it may not work but okay whatever like you understood uh what I'm trying to say right yeah let's go yeah okay everything is okay so see these are hypertext basically if we click on any of them you will be redirected to some other web page so this is called hypertext okay I hope you understood what it's a hypertext rate now the other thing comes is markup language whatever markup language now uh in the um OLED uh era what used to happen was the book printers like this was a book okay and there was text written by authors like and there were some um different symbols okay maybe there was this symbol this used to indicate that the letters over which or the word through which this is there has to be in bold okay and suppose some of this that means italics so this was given to the publishers tell them that words you know over with this forward has to be in bold or words on which this was the word needs to be in italics these things are called markups okay the I mean some symbols or something which you know tell a word or tell a paragraph or tell a phrase how to look we're going to look bold it can look italics it you know an Interline can be there on it or can be indicate indented or something or like that okay so similar similarly we in HTML also we have something this letter has to be bold or this has to be emphasized this has to be italics this has to be underlined this is all this can be done yeah that's why it is called a markup language now you might be wondering how this markup is done in HTML so this markup is done using tags don't worry if you have never heard about this term but it is called so let's go to our Chrome and let's go to charity points right and let's see what our estimate has web browser will format and display the contact basically how a web browser a markup is so 10 you know content and see how to look with the help of a tag the browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content okay all right now dress of the part we would see in another video and we'll be going to look at two of these main tags one is heading tag and one is paragraph there okay now I will give you homework okay go search moreover what are tags exactly where look deep into it and obviously search for how H or heading tag works and you know how you write it in a HTML code and similarly do the same thing for paragraph tag okay now don't worry I will obviously be teaching it to you in the next video but it would be better if you go and check it out beforehand so you would be like you know it will be more creative and in the previous video we learned about you know what everything we are going to you know look in this video exactly again I mean in the series exactly and what else did you talk about we talked about what are the different languages and Frameworks we would be you know covering in this and we also like talked about a little bit of HTML and what is HTML what does it stand for and you know we did the entire anatomy of the HTML all right so in the end I have we talked about the tags all right I told you that HTML stands for hypertext markup language so markup language we talked about and how markup language I mean how markup is exactly implied here through tax Okay cool so in this video we are going to look at uh how basically tag works okay so for that go to a Chrome browser and open codependent.io game just write code pen dot IO it's go to it however you just click on start coding okay okay so I mean this is my default layout you can just change your layouts from here like this or like this so yeah but I prefer to use this one good so what is this okay let me tell you so these are the code brackets here you write a HTML code your CSS Go to JavaScript code and the same thing as shown here okay in this white web page Okay cool so since we are going to work for HTML only we will just know double click on it and close the CSS and JavaScript for the timing so now what uh we are going to do here is let's let's do um okay let's go to the this thing okay okay this is the one of the web pages which I found okay I mean I share the link with you in the description you might check it from there it is this um adventure of Sherlock Holmes I guess you might have read it I mean I read it um when I was a child so it was like one of my favorite books so Gutenberg is basically a online library so we just went for my favorite book The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and um yeah it is the HTML version of it okay so if you look at this part Okay so okay I mean you are looking at this file rate so my question is how will you you know uh replicate this thing in your my browser okay I mean suppose I just copied this code and I mean pasted it here okay I mean see it is a whole single line right even I have like put the enters here it doesn't matter the this thing is still in one single group okay okay we'll uh you know uh do this step by step okay first of all you can see that the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes this is you know greater than this I mean this is the you can say heading over this is the title exactly okay so how would you like increase this thing okay for that what you'll do you will just write it first and then I'll tell you okay so this this thing H1 what is this H1 is I mean okay let's go down this uh these are angular brackets okay these cells that anything inside of them has to be treated as a tag and whatever we write inside tells us like um how like what are the modifications we'll do okay cool now angular Brack I mean once you open the tab we have to close the tag as well okay otherwise it will think that the whole content from here till wherever we have to be undertaken and Direction but that is not the case you only want um The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to be in you know a little bold so we will just write um let's run here I mean you have to close it like this okay cool see I mean you can see it okay cool now what okay I'll just do one thing yeah okay yeah that looks pretty much it yes yeah but uh what about what about what about if if if I want buy another line and add the condolence in the line how would I do that and wing of it I mean if I just if it would have been a word I word or talk I would just simply click enter but it's not changing here Okay so for that we have tag called Break BR okay okay you can see there is a gap between by another content oil now that's because of BR okay now you might be wondering what is H1 what is PR everything okay so the very first thing to become a great coders help yourself okay now to help yourself you must be very good at doubling away so just you know type headings in HTML and go to the first link the first link which I opened was WD School server so you can see HTML editing titles or subtitles that you want to display on a web page okay example are heading one two three four five six of them okay H1 defines the most important heading or the biggest heading and H6 defines the least important thing on the smallest setting okay and after H6 it doesn't matter you can examinate it it won't affect or good so this is about cool now it is browse automatically add some white spaces before and after hitting so that is what happened okay headings are important okay you can read the rest of the steps later and we can check PR tag in HTML again and you can go to w these tools again and you can see inserts single line breaks in a text which we did here okay now to make it a little more better let's write H2 here okay I mean it is a subtitle uh this is important but it is a subtitle cool it looks cool I mean I can write what I can write here H3 and I'll close this three okay okay and one more important thing which is there I mean look at this it's looking a little bit good better than okay now one more thing is you can see that BR is we have not closed Bry okay so basically there are two types of tag one which are closing time which requires a closing tag as well and one are open tags they don't require a closing tag like VR okay we'll talk more about what are closing tags what are the open tags later okay so now uh I guess um that was like pretty much it for this video I mean you have to you know um uh retain these things again just go to the web check for first thing tags what are tags like I told you in the previous video as well but look at once again then look at heading tag look at the BR tag okay try to replicate this thing which I did without without looking this code thing okay and and and and what else yeah and go for go and for opening tank and closing times what are they okay cool so we have already covered two videos where we you know talked about the introduction of web development we talked about how internet works and the different languages we are going to use right and then we talked about you know HTML tags and how do they work away so in this video we are going to look at anatomy of tags okay so what exactly is attack okay so suppose simple I write this check okay so basically this um okay cool this whole thing is called a tag okay now these are basically the hell called elements okay this is the content okay this is the closing element and yeah that is it okay this is the whole thing okay now you might see this as so what have what used to happen in in the older period that suppose someone wrote a book and he wrote hello world okay now he wants to you know make the heading bigger so what we do he'll simply put a squiggly line under it okay this wiggly line would be interpreted by a interpreter okay I'll just write an INT that means interpreter okay and he will then understand that okay this sign means I have to you know uh use hello world as a heading or like print it as a heading okay so similar way similar thing happens with our web page where The Interpreter is r browser okay cool so this was the anatomy of this type okay now let's talk about another tag which we use PR tag okay now I would really appreciate if you remember what BR tag uh do oh yeah so if you remember good if you don't I'll tell you in but still try to you know remember or I mean these are the very basic tags and you don't have to Google every time to you know find the functioning of these okay so okay cool uh yeah so BR tag basically breaks or acts as a enter of a keyboard okay slide cool now this is uh only element okay it do not have a Content you do not have a closing element it is it just only have element and this is attack these tags are called cell closing okay your writing is very bad here but still try to manage says closing tags okay now you might be wondering how we you know uh differentiate or know which tag is a element I mean which tag is a self losing time or which tag is a you know you do need to have a closing tab so what you do you just simply go to Dev talks dot IO okay go to HTML go to elements and search for the BR tab where it's here now you go inside okay and here it might be somewhere okay okay where are we exactly okay why is it true button tag here okay the documentation is a little wrong let us run in the button tag but let's see if it works okay it is not working okay let's just say BR tag opening and close okay let's just search this over here okay this is charcoal flow you won't be eating this let's just write uh selfexclusion tag right okay again it's not okay not much is written it should have been here but simply to the button I would let me tell you like this is how you look at your documentation okay okay uh let's see if we go to heading tag here you can see they see that both starting and ending diagram mandatory so this is how you learn it okay we're going to look at one more tag called HR tag Okay so it must have a start tab it must not have an entire okay HR time uh do what exactly it adds the uh this uh what do we say this uh yeah a horizontal line okay so similarly we'll just use HR um HR here right and then we use one more HR here okay now you can see that we got two lines okay but but let me show you one thing okay this site um takes few minutes okay here we are okay okay can you see that R line and again these are the same okay so the documentation has changed of the book as well like it was a different before this but never mind let's look at each attributes okay so what are attributes attributes are basically like C I have created a line here okay but um how to have this double line over different things how to have that use that through attributes okay like there's no shade and there is size and there's width etc etc suppose I write HR I write size as three hmm okay why is it not working here hmm okay okay cool it's working now see the width is different I mean the size different it's a little shade is different so that is how you use the uh these things okay now the only thing left here is put one more tag called Center okay now your task is to check what Center is exactly okay and okay we should be having the same thing here as well otherwise it would be um literacy rate okay yeah cool now you can see it looks coffee's other better right now you now your task is to check how Center works okay and you will comment it in the comment section here okay cool so I guess that was the whole anatomy of the tags all right and and what else okay we talked about let's have a quick recap we talked about tags how okay let's go to the web output how tag looks okay we talked about elements you talked about closing elements you talk about the content then we talk about how it is you know similar to the previous era then we talk about self losing tags right the BR tags and we talked about um documentation which is Dev docs.io on it and then we did some figuring of our own and then we talk about attribute so that's all we covered in this video okay so I hope it was clear to you so in the last three videos um we learned about you know HTML and HTML tags and Anatomy or HTML5 right so from this video we would be you know looking forward to enough code in our own ID is like vs code or other ID is assume I work on but I work on this course so I would be like showing you how to do that okay so in this video we are going to look at HTML boilerplate over there now what is a HTML boilerplate so similar boil plate is hot template okay trigger template and it is a necessary template okay uh you know you have to add this HTML border plate for every uh for like every widget you make okay so let me give you an analogy like how this thing works let's um look at this formal letter format okay so here you know you have you have like standard template like name of the sender address State and salutations name definition from here okay and write paragraph and then in the end you like your sincerely name a signature that is how you write or letter okay similar way we have a standard format of HTML boilerplate which we work on okay let's open uh this thing damage team let's um okay to add value create one which clone is just recorded HTML and then click on the HTML file so this is what we call foreign um I mean live one by one to understand what it is all about okay now first is doctrive HTML okay so okay let's create a text uh dog tag so uh DOT type it you know indicates what type of content for language you are what I want okay okay cool so you can see we have dog type of HTML I mean this file has to be seen as an HTML document okay nothing else just an HTML account so I have to see if I have to be seen and whenever I write HTM it is always considered the latest version of it whenever compiler compile this code it written matches are okay this is a HTML file document and I have to read it okay cool now what is this HTML okay so you can see that we have HTML just so this quickly this is the root starting of our HTML file like uh whatever HTML okay all the contents inside this and the closing time of HTML would be announced HTML content which would be uh displayed on the web okay cool now what is this language and this tells us in what language we are basically writing or like for which Target I mean for this audience or Target English now you might have seen that many times uh like there are Auto wise for visually bad people so you know to have the correct pronunciation and everything so it should be known like which language it is reading I mean the web so that's why we specify the language here okay now here comes the head part because okay so head is attack in which uh if we write some things and these things are not visible to a person or to a user okay it tells us that head contents helps the web to render correctly okay and and I guess that is that is the whole thing of how I mean it works okay now we have the metacar set okay so basically this is just the character setting or how we were you know use the character okay for this let's let's do one thing let's go here and let's write cache set utf8 so you can see our duty f8 is a character encoding system with let's represent characters as Sky tags and Chinese selector okay now there are other encoding uh systems as well so let's search for it and coding HTML good in it it's okay you can see that there are different 32 and many others so that is what uh Castle do okay and there are other metas this are like not necessary for you to learn so you can just skip them okay I mean if it would be like helpful in the future I would definitely talk about them but it is currently not required for the beginner sake so we won't talk about it okay here is the uh title okay and then what uh title exactly is let me just show you to do this thing okay simply write google.com Okay good ah whatever thing that comes on the tab part I mean this thing the logo of Google and Google written how that is rendered that is rendered through our title part okay okay I mean I hope that is understood part right cool a headache now comes the body part so body is where you would be spending most of your day okay this is the part where we write the actual HTML code okay and here is like whatever you write will be rendered on the screen so we talked about H1 so I will write um which one here okay I can buy it hello okay then here we can have the let's say my first web page then after you know doing all this okay we did write the code we did everything but how to render yourself yeah that is anything you would click on go live okay now it could be that it won't like go live won't be able to rewind so you have to add the extension for it again like here is the extensions go to extensions and search for live server okay see I have installed it so you just have to uh there would be an install button just click over here and restart your code okay and you will be able to see the whole library now click on the go okay okay I guess I understood what is the problem we have to make a folder okay so let's do one time we'll just have a folder here called okay okay and you select the folder and we'll open that okay now here we have HTML we will have extreme code I told you about everything my favorite page okay and we would have H1 hello world all right now let's travel I can see Hello World which was written the body is rendered on the screen and you can see here title which we wrote here my first web page is written over here cool so I hope uh boilerplate thing is you know like you understood it fine okay and again tell you how to do it this is HTML including I want you would get over it better for you okay then you may change the character speed if you want but I want to recommend that because YouTube is the most common and the most used one foreign right whatever you want to write anybody by okay oh in the last few videos we learned about the basics of HTML right we learned about how to use tab we learned about how do we know you HTML on our own ID and open it on our local browser it will be also talked about HTML account all right so in this video um any you have understood the basics yet uh to make your own website Okay so yeah I want to you know I look at one HandsOn project okay we'll talk about I mean whatever we have learned until now and along here you also learn few concepts of HTML like um image addition or and what else uh we'll also know about the best we also learn about links hyperlinks Okay so okay so the question of this video is what are we going to make so we are going to make a personal website okay so let's open this okay so this is John cleanberg's website Okay so at corner University look up so this is what we have written okay if only going to vary but uh any you can add your more details and everything but okay we'll see how much we are going to cover okay so see you can see that it's gently looks a bit so I am going to Riley Jones homepage in front of it you okay so let's start it's always HTML with no D we don't need okay here you can write the title yeah I'm going to write this one thing works homepage okay that is all I'm going to do that okay um let's see okay I have to have all these details here so let's start with the name you should write your own name okay let's write let's um let's have which one you write clean book okay foreign let's copy this is oh yeah okay if you call C or if you can see this okay find one kind of whatever little italics right our metallics HTML Indian s visiting VM elements all right okay then I will see them two tags here so let's delete this and we wanted some developers so you can use my how multiple elements okay so by default visual results semantic meaning is different em elements this is Express emphasis of its content okay Oh by silence has a stress over some time well is simply okay I'll just betrayed this thing okay so that is all that is usually you can have one more tag strong all right foreign right um okay let's see what happened already so when I am going to add more details here that is one of them I will add to another web page okay we will cover this in further videos so for the timing you just copy this much part all right let's cover the attack um it looks quite similar very details let's have it here okay we'll have VR everywhere um let's open it obviously foreign now you can see here and this is Delta are looking right now we need one thing obviously learn about our feelings obviously but till then we'll just look at this now we can see that there is line break you know how to add it HR Indian like talk about daily deals uh attribute and everything but since you're talking about it again okay this is fine and this much body yes almost here um next uh what's the lighting of Our Own x48 h35 It Was Written here so right oh and let's see okay let's cut it and yes it is much better much more identical the speech your own details here right you have to write your own name you have to write your own direction or whatever degree Department College address which is then you can see we have some bullet points here so I guess this was pretty much it which I intended to come here in this video so in the previous video we learned about uh you know we just started making our own personal uh website I write so we basically you know learn about um putting uh learnings of heading tag and paragraph tag then we also learned about uh emphasize and strong tag as well right and we talked about the difference between the emphasize tag and um uh I mean emphasize second italics tag and uh difference between strong tag and the bull tag all right so if I mean I have started the running of this video and this is what we have achieved till now of this page okay this looks this looks fine all right now we want to add these points but in bullet points right so how to do that so I would highly recommend you guys to I mean try to do this on your own using the Google search and the mdn but I mean your movie is free to you know watch the video but I would highly recommend if you do it on your own otherwise you can follow me here so what we are going to write is um unordered list HTML and we'll decide mdn date okay you can see that we got something about the UL so what does UL stand for UL stands for unordered list okay similarly we have another list called well okay that is orderless we look at the order list um in a while but the timing will learn about the UL time okay so you can see that there are different types one Circle one is disk one is a square okay then one is triangle as well but it is not supported by all your browsers okay so very simple example is this okay tags like I mean uh the syntax of having a list is this okay so what it has we add given in which we have to provide the list okay then in the Ally I mean um DF I mean for every uh list item we include it in the alert app all right then we have a little more complex version of this like this you can check it on your own okay then we have different different things okay so before proceeding let's try to have it in our own website so what we just learned we learned that we have to have a urta okay then we are going to have the less items now how the list item works already talked about let's just copy this okay and let's just write it here all right hmm then let's open another attack and then let's uh okay sorry oh yeah let's copy this all right okay then what uh let's have another light app and let's copy this part okay I mind you I'm just copying this you have to add your own details here okay I mean it is not necessary that you have books and teachings you can write or Hobbies Etc as well all right okay I guess this is enough you mean we don't have to add other ones so you can see see I have the bullet points here all right now uh we saw that there are types as well so what you can do you can write type and you can Define the type let's try the Discord let's see okay the disk is the default one Let's uh Circle now let's see okay the these are the hollow ones okay then there's a type um Square as well let's see okay so you can see that squares are here okay now what we can do is let's add um HR tag here and let's save it let's see okay um should not be here it should be outside the site now let's see looks pretty neat okay now uh I'm doing a little bit different from the website let's have one thing let's have H3 and let's write Hobbies okay you can write our Hobbies here and let's save it let's see how it looks now it looks good all right now when you go down you can check the C also part okay there are other HTML elements related to the one which we're viewing so we can view the ol1 the order disk so orderless is elements represent an order list of items all right so I one two three four five four ABC or in the Roman numericals all right cool what are the types here a follower a for upper F or Lucas Roman numerals and see you can see that default is one but we can have different ones as well okay uh you can go down and you can see it is the same it is like uh similar way which we did the Nautilus we just write order list we enclose it and we write the different types of list items here all right okay then you can check the other parts as well I'll add the link in the description all right but um we look at some of it let's write Ally and let's write our Hobbies okay since I don't know about uh John cleanberg's hobby I'm going to write my own Hobbies okay so okay wait a minute we have to write the all first okay now we'll write Li what we can add in the LI here okay my hobbies are reading novels rate and what else do I like I like playing badminton and I also like bringing my own coffee okay now let's see how it looks okay you can see that the numbering is one two three like like that okay you can obviously change it with the ol type as a you can see that it has changed to ABC and then you can have old type as this let's see one two three that is in the Roman numericals you can have the capital Roman numericals as well all right and then what else was there okay the capital alphabetical order is also there huh cool this looks pretty neat all right let's just add an HR tag here save it let's see okay this looks uh pretty nice all right hmm okay that's nice now what else uh do we need to learn about here like we learned about the bullet points we learned about headings we learned about paragraphs you learned about the HR tag now what else what else can you see in the website which we have not used here okay I guess um you must have guessed it correctly we haven't used these links right I mean if I click on this this would take me to some other page so these are called um links hyperlinks and we use um I mean we inculcate this in our website through anchor tab all right so I guess we'll talk about the anchor tag later in the week I mean later in the next video so since for this video I guess the list part was covered and we covered the unordered list and the order list and the different types of both of them okay now you may play with the list and you may check the other attributes of the list and I'll post the description in the box and you can check it from there okay so thanks for watching this video and see you later and so far we have been working on our just give me a minute yeah okay so we are working on our personal website uh right using HTML let's see what we have got so far okay so this is the effect which we have you know so according to me it looks good okay we learned about you know HR tag and uh H1 attack DM system tag we learned about the points and other things after okay great now uh another thing which I want you guys to know is let's just go to the homepage as you can see these um links right okay if we click on this link waiting into some other page okay so how to have these things okay so what you can do you can click on inspect and then you can see that there is something called a a tag and there's some hrdf so we'll talk about what all of these things are let's just say anchor tag HTML MDM let's go here and you can see what anchor element is Anchor element within attribute creates a hyperlink okay Two web pages file email address location in the same page or anything else a URL can address okay no within each a we should indicate the links destination okay it is done through the href tag and then there are attributes which you can you know uh check on your own although these are not very much important I'd say um there's one called Target which we'll see later okay so let's rather than just reading let's try on uh see how it works okay suppose I have to specify this uh so what will I do I just copy this address and I'll try to put it over here okay I just come here uh there was that let's just see it's over Department of computer science uh where is it okay so let's just remove it for now what you'll do we'll put the anchor tag okay you will put a href which we just copied and here you will have computer science okay now we'll go to our website and see okay there's the link which is the detail as well if I click on the link have to be taken I would be taken to this page and if I click here the website is a bit slow yeah why is the website different I mean we just copied the same address okay it was um loading error but you can see that both websites are same okay in a similar way let's try put one over information files like present here we'll just you know copy the link and let's just have the eight I over here let's just close it and let's write sref and let's paste it let's save it and what we come up with again uh I mean you know you go to jail so what we are doing here exactly okay so that is that another thing which I wanted to talk was Target okay Target is you know where to display the linked URL okay it can be the current browser context which is by default blank is basically a new top uh new tab okay so what does that mean exactly let's see suppose I put the Target as say blank let's save it let's see what we got here now okay it opens in a new tab rather than if I click here it gets open in the same tab so that is what the difference is okay similar with a cell which is the current one uh current browsing context which is the default one which we already saw then this is these two are there which are not um not available from Hobbies this part I'll just copy Ctrl C sorry control X I'll save it and let's see what our website looks okay it looks like this right uh and okay okay now what I am going to do is I'm going to put an H3 tag with it would be saying my Hobbies okay now let's see how it looks okay and if I put an anchor tie here I feel my whole beef okay I'll just remove this part okay and here I just paste whatever was written here now I can have t h r e f apps always okay okay now if I go here you can see there's a link if I click over here I would be taken to our new page.html so this is called uh internal linking of our web pages I mean you can have n number of web pages here and if you want to Interlink them you can Interlink them via this okay either internal linking which we just saw okay date so that was all uh which was to be taught about hack attack online so now we have learned how to put the links here which we can see here as a I mean you can put other links as well here everywhere like where you want but I just wanted to give you a gist of it so that was there okay so that was all for this video thank you for watching and see you later web development series and in this video what we are going to do um we are going to learn about the image stack okay so by the name you can't figure it out uh what it is it is all about it is basically inserting our images okay or what can I say embedding our images um inside our page or web page I would say okay so it is that now we come back here and let's just go IMG MD and HTML okay and we come to here okay modular developer work okay and I go to here um slow uh my neck okay but anyways the page okay so IMG tag is basically image embed element it basically embeds our image into the a document okay then uh you know supported uh formats and other stuff which we won't be needing a search all right so yeah great works now what we can do is uh this is index.html right what we want to do let's open a folder um in the desktop let's make a folder of file name image and let's just select folder and here I'll tell you why we are doing this later but here we'll have our index shot HTML okay and what we can do is we can first check how to use it so the way how you get class not necessary there are two attributes SRC and ALT okay first we will talk about this RC attribute I mean it is required and it contains the path to the image you want to impact now you can either embed the element or I mean the image uh from uh like your local desktop or what you can do is you can embed the image from the URL of any website splash .com and what I'm going to do this is the nice image I'll just pick it I'll just cop y um image address I am going to do something like IMG and ALT if not we have not looked at it so I'll just delete it and the SRC I'll just paste this link now if I go live on my website this is what I'm getting okay next date you can you can also set the width and the height of the image as well with let's say 100 pixels and height also as uh and it's work now we go back and copy it now I mind you that we don't set the width or height uh through our HTML for that I already told you for beautify for styling we have CSS right now suppose uh what I'll do there is this image I'll do what I'll save this image in the water the folder name image right so I'll just save it here okay and then what I am going to do you can see that there is and what I'll do is remove this and here I'll try to add Premium Photo okay this is the local photo which I am having and this is what I can nice great yes so um that was all about the SRC tag and then there is something called Alt okay so all basically is an attribute which holds the text description of the image which is in mandatory but is incredibly useful accessibility so the pose by mistakes I used a different URL a wrong URL here then what would happen it would not be loaded but then I can like tell the users that okay you cannot load the image that is fine but you can like get an idea about the images so suppose this is a flower interface okay what I'm going to do here is I'm going to write alt and I'm going to go to write flower and base okay I'll just save it suppose here uh I just write some gibberish and I save it if I go to obviously the mesh path is wrong so it is not loading but it's all text is present there which tells or which gives us an idea of what it is right so yeah right what we are going to learn is we are going to learn about tables all right how a table looks and everything about it okay so let me just show you how a table looks okay suppose this is a table okay I mean data data data data okay cool so how do we exactly make a table so let's go to HTML uh let's go to Chrome and first let's see what we are going to like what we are expect to make so like suppose you have to add a work experience like this okay I mean it cannot be good like this obviously this is a structured using CSS so let's let's okay let's do one thing let's just write the code first okay let's have H1 okay work experience right let's save it let's just go live for a second okay cool now suppose I have a paragraph or okay let's do one thing let's have a list okay okay and let's select 2002 to 2004 SG at x y z okay now let's see how it looks hmm I mean we can do one thing we can just have UL over here okay okay I mean suppose I just add this and you have a cap I mean okay yeah let's save it now let's see cool okay sorry my bad yeah and let's write um another tag of 2003 to 2004. and research done at ABC let's go and see I mean see it's not very much aligned I mean you can see right and how to exactly do that so that's the question here right so let's just do one thing let's just remove the UL for now okay let's go to table HTML mdn we'll just go to the table part um just come down and see this this is how simple table is made okay cool but just don't think so it is very simple like that I mean we can have complex tables um like this as well all right cool so now let's do one thing let's just go to here and let's just try and write our Code table code of our own so just write table okay then okay if you go back let's go to simple one you can see that there's something called TR something called TD so let me tell you what TR and TD is exactly so see whatever is inside a column is a TD and whatever like this single row this is called TR so TR stands for table row and TD stands for table data cool okay so suppose if I write TR that means I have made a single row okay enough I have to write a TD here I'll just write 2002 to 2000. 4 okay then I'll write another TD and I'll write as G at x y z let's say let's write any internet if I did okay now if I have to make another row what I'll do I'll just simply write here again okay I'll write TD and I'll write something 2005 to 2007 let's suppose let's say and then we'll write another TD and um we'll do what uh we'll simply write um ABC okay now let's see I mean you can see that there is Gap here okay um okay suppose I write let's go to attribute let's see let's see okay Okay cool so this is what it is I mean it's still looking a bit I mean see that these two are aligned these two are aligned on that's how this looks like a table okay now one more thing um which I wanted to talk about here is um table is basically divided into three parts okay uh okay sorry yeah so one is called T head one is called the body and one is called the foot okay so I can just you know copy this stuff whole part and write in my body okay I'll save it and in the head part what I can write instead of t d I will write th okay I'll write ears and in another th I'll write work or let's say designation okay let's save it let's go to our website and see that it has been built the head part similarly the thing goes for the foot part you might be wondering why do we separate these terms with these separate resource because sometimes we have to you know isolate a specific part in our table like suppose I have to isolate this part and customize it using CSS which I can do later hold it cool now you might be wondering that something like this this I mean they have borders but why don't our code have borders right I mean this is a very generic thing which might be coming to your mind so let's just go to the attribute and let's read the attributes align BG color border Etc and you can see that there is this icon beside them since icon means depress deprecated okay not for using new websites so uh deprecated exactly what does it exactly mean is that it is outdated and no longer in use all right I mean see first we had floppy disks right but then it got converted into pin drives now right no one use floppy disks yeah so what does that mean that I mean it still does the work but still we don't use it anymore because we have something more efficient something better so we go we can't see to achieve a similar effect use the CSS property somewhere okay and borders CSS border but so since we have not learned CSS we will try to have a border here okay uh so what we'll do we'll go to table we write border we'll write one okay let's see the website now see we got a border here right uh 90s look type order which is which was used before right so yeah so I guess that was all for the table part uh so far we have learned a lot about HTML right in about the basic HTML codes and then we made our own portfolio website and then we learn about uh image tags and lists and everything and now we have come to uh how to create forms all right in HTML so okay I'll just open my Chrome I have this spec so a form basically looks like this right where you got a first name a last name date of birth I mean these can be anything but you can like type your own things here and click on the submit button on this information gets submitted right is what a form is all right so before jumping in what we'll do we'll decide forms HTML and MDR okay we'll just open this link uh formation element print document section containing interactive controls for submitting information like this or date then there are attributes and stuff you can like read about it and get what it means exactly all right and then like there are different things then we have some examples and stuff like that okay so let's let's do one thing let's go here and let's write form I mean don't need an action as such right now we'll talk about it later now we have created a form let's go live let's see okay it's empty what does that mean so I mean this just simply means that we got an interactive thing with this all right so you can like think it as what that this tag does is create something like this all right that's it there is no information in here as such how we get I mean these things and these boxes so for that um we got our name uh sorry we got two things uh one is labels okay and one is input all right uh so these are texts basically written for you know addressing a box like this are called labels and these boxes are called um input input boxes all right so you can have different type of inputs um let's just go to input here and let's see so there are a lot of input types there are buttons check boxes and whatnot okay so you just try one thing let's just try and make something called label okay I mean the phone is not needed this right name here for now okay and then write um input type text all right let's try and see this yeah that is right here then let's go to our page again you can see okay you got something here right and is it sometime similarly uh what you can have is tag here cool you can have the friendly builds I mean see the text box is one important and you can see that this button is the another important thing right so let's uh let's remove the label for now let's just write I mean we don't need a label right now let's just write input type uh button all right let's just remove this input and we're gonna sound button here let's have a value uh Summit let's save it and let's just go to webpage let's see cool I mean see it's not aligned or anything obviously but uh make all the alignment I just told you we do it using CSS but still try to see it it looks something all right cool similarly you can have other input types which you can check on your own like there is a post check box um new ID is not required right now we'll talk about it later we'll have input as daytime another important input I want to talk about is password password is favored let's go here yeah we got a lot of things but uh when the date time is not working okay let's just go here let's okay it's a simple date uh let's go let's just update here okay save it you can see you can use the date from here you can have the check box and see the password box what's interesting here is see the password is encrypted all right so yeah so you can check the input of mdn and you can like have different different types you may check it on your own and see how everything works all right so I guess that was all for um right now about the forms we'll in the next video we will try and look at um what do we see my form all right in the previous video we learned about forms okay let's just start this thing and let's see what uh we get here exactly so this is kind of like I told you about the form thing right so this is how it gently looks all right but in the previous video I told you that uh we are going to you know um make a form like make an exact like a representable form all right so let's do one thing let's just remove all this okay let's just add this thing all right and now we can make a form okay let's write this H3 and let's see contact me all right uh let's add a charter and let's have no shade and photos for the thickness one okay I don't remember that but let's see what we got so far okay okay I have everything is spelling wrong here according okay let's do one thing it's a change at 2h1 okay let's see okay looks better okay let's have the form we have action all right let's have the form okay we got method and an action all right let's have a label which which says uh first name okay then we'll have an input here uh yeah type text let's save it let's see how it looks okay looks a bit uh better okay now I want you to check one thing required in HTML okay let's go to this link uh and you can see that require attribute isn't it specifies that and input field must be filled out before submitting the form okay so uh suppose I have I have required return here okay and let's have a br tag here for now and let's have a look at my bag input type but submit okay okay now the submit button is here if I write without writing anything if I try to submit it we got this radiation that please fill out this form all right course looks cool now we have another attribute which is important is placeholder uh it means that sometimes the Box uh something is written there to you know tell user what to exactly fail so let's say write your first name okay let's save it let's see now uh see that there's a placeholder when no text is written now I can write text here okay let's write quote D we get it right okay cool now what else we can have let's have another label and write last name for now we'll have input type text and run we will add a br texture and let's have a placeholder right your last name rate and and we'll have a required field as well okay hmm okay let's go see okay uh not very great but still I mean it's something right I mean The Styling we'll do using CSS and we'll reach there let's again have an input of type email okay and you can have a br tagger okay okay we haven't added a label here let's just add a link uh email okay okay this works I guess hmm okay this looks good okay and we'll have required and placeholder as write your email all right okay looks good and another thing of this attribute is that it would go through basic validation tests of whether we have written the correct email or not wait what are the basic uh emails what are they like we are at the rate and Dot I mean these two will be the basic validations of an email right so let's just go here let's write something blah blah blah okay you can see that please include and update in in the email address and we'll suppose we just add it okay we have to enter a part following this at the rate obviously let's write yeah for now okay any other validation no that's it that is all the validation that is there right okay cool hmm all right so what else can be there hey in your contact me form what else can be there oh another thing which can be real let's say uh your message okay that also works okay and the input type here is would be uh text area okay so let's uh texture as well okay input diapers and then input a what we'll have here is simple text area like this okay we don't want name you don't want ID for now okay this column tells us like how wide would be our text area and this row cell is how long it would be okay see it is like this uh let's just first of all let's add a br let's save it yeah so you can also like uh uh change the width height through this button as well but for the initial boilerplate it should be like this okay okay cool now we talked about that thermometer functionality would come through JavaScript but right also we can have the submit button functionality okay how it would be let's say let's see in the action uh what we'll write mail to info and here like mail 2 would be like whatever mail you want to be get like uh let's write my email address here first of all okay so this action would do what it would uh open my mail ID and the I mean the receiver uh the receiver address would be this all right cool now let's go to this and let's try to submit this okay all right okay I'll just write my name here look at this let's hit something and try to submit okay one thing you can see that it is not submitting off even after adding this and everything that this is because we don't have email Handler so how to add email under we'll just go to these three dots we'll go to settings you go to privacy and security okay then we load site settings then you go to additional permissions then we go to protocol handles you can uncheck this icon uh site scanners 200 protocols and we and you can you know remove this from here I'll write that as it open your mail ID this icon would come here just you know go to it and click on allow done close it now try to submit it uh it would open my mail ID the sender here would be this uh right okay and it hasn't added the texture I don't know why is that let's check if we have not added anything okay we'll have the entire pass to explain okay we got our okay one more thing uh that is not a thing I don't see any problem as such okay let's write something let's add something let's set something adderate something that is something I will let's try to do some of this let's see hopefully it should work now all right uh it says till the there's you know text here why is this happening exactly let's go back to our code let's check if we are missing something hmm I I don't think so we are missing anything like that I guess there is some problem with the main ID right now all right so if I get the you know solution for it I'll add it in the comment box or like whatever the problem would be at this time I would put it in the comment box other than that this is the required code already so I guess uh we just understood how to make our basic contact form will be placeholders with required Fields the email field and with the text box all right so thanks for watching with this so thank you for watching this video and see you later hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and we have leveled up all right so we have you know learned uh respectable amount of HTML like you would be required to make any um you know representable form of web page uh you would be able to do it you know we talked about forms and we talked about tables we talked about lists we talk about you know basic HTML boilerplates and everything all right and there are other things which I don't feel necessary but if you want you who can look for it I mean iframe is there and some other stuff you can look that on your own right so from this video we would be starting uh CSS all right so what does CSS stands for CSS stands for cascading styling sheet all right just put it here let's create okay cool now what are the reasons yeah CSS is used why can't we just you know use HTML for the selling because see HTML stylings if you talk about uh uh it is not preferred all right because see because of HTML styling the alignment gets all messed up all right let me write a line all right and sometimes it does not produce the correct result as well okay it messes the layout now let's just go quickly and check CSS H uh mdn box all right so CSS cascading style sheets so it is you know basically a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of markup languages so markup languages include HTML or XML okay and then all other things as well all right so currently uh that is all the theory you should be knowing about CSS okay and let's do one thing let's go here and let's see how do we add our you know CSS so let's do one thing let's write style dot CSS and how do we basically link it with our HTML so here you just write link CSS okay actually Ariel is basically relationship which is style sheet almost all right then there is hyperreference which is this styles.css okay cool now let's just go to style.css and how do we basically style things so just just you know let's go uh and see what the web page look like okay this look like this now what if I have to add the background uh here what I'll do I'll simply write background color CSS mdn all right I'll just go here I just go here I'll just check it how we do it so use the background color like this okay so let us sit there all right now what we do exactly is C suppose I have to uh modify the whole area there right so I'll be using a tag there right okay and how do we like exactly use the um attacking and everything oh let's see I go here see this Tiger's body I'll simply say body and I'll open this thing and I'll write here background color and I got a very nice background color so I'll just write the background color code it's e a f and then I'll write 6 F6 6 okay receiver we'll go here see background color has again it is looking kinda pretty all right like at least two minutes kind of looking fitted to me all right so that is one thing then you can you know the changes in the H1 as well okay let's do one thing let's try this one and let's see how do we know add color in the text I'll just simply say X color CSS mdl we'll go here we'll see how it works so it's just simply color the color property set the foreground color value of an element text and text decoration set the current color value okay so we'll just come here we'll simply write color and again I got a very nice color which is 6X p f p f okay it's the same ad let's see how it works see performance already looking kinda pretty right I mean at least for me okay so yeah that is one thing then we can have another thing here as called line that is simply say Center and see okay this should have been what I mean a line okay I don't know okay let's just simply say align text CSS mdn okay it's texture line so here we just simply write text align Center let's save it let's go let's see see I mean kind of looking very nice right so cool so there's one thing you should be able to very good at Google search for CSS I mean because uh these properties are like in thousands all right so you won't be able to you know learn about every one of them but you should be able to know like what you want to do like I know about here that I want to align my text somewhere so just simply write align text CSS right that's what you have to do there so I guess that was it for the introductory video of CSS uh so let's just quickly review what we talked about here we talked about CSS its reform why don't we use HTML styling over CSS then learn about linking CSS style sheet to our HTML then how basically we style everything we use the tag like body tag I use it um modified body the H1 tag and modified action like that okay in this video we are going to look at CSS syntax or you can say anatomy of CSS okay so in the previous video we learned about how do you know you can add CSS file inside your HTML file so just to give you a quick recap I'm just going to just going to put one index dot h tml here I'm going to add okay something is wrong yeah it's back okay we added the boilerplate here now uh what we did we create an index dot CSS and in here we have uh yeah link CSS the relationship style sheet and hrfs style.css okay okay I named it index.css so let's just change it to index.css okay now I'll show you how you know CSS syntax is written I mean I did show you in the previous one but let's see how like what is a breakage of it so you can say the breakage of Cs syntax is it is something like selector okay and then inside of it uh there is property and then there is um selection let's see okay and these are all in the curly brackets now see this selector this is basically who like who we need to change okay property is what that means okay we know what like who we need to change exactly or you can say which but what inside that selector we need to change so that is defined by property what and this tells us how much like what you want to change like if you want to you know give it a width how much width we want to like make it bold how much gold that is told by this selection what is sold by the property and who is stored by the selector now let's try and implement this a bit let's see how it works here I'm going to have an H1 here I'm going to say in the text and then I'm going to have a p where I'm going to say paragraph text I go to my index and select who or what I want to change I want to change H1 okay inside action what I want to change I'll just say let's say color how much or what should be the color here yeah let's say apple I'll just save it I order my index and I'll just click on collide so okay why haven't it been changed thank you it is index.ch says and here it is href is also index.css let's do one thing let's say it style.css and here we will use uh and rename it so hope it works okay that is weird Y is said not working I think ah okay my bad this dot not supposed to be here I'll like talk about why I added the dot and why it is not needed so basically when you write elements like H1 element of P element you want to you know change we just directly write them as I told you in the previous video but if you like suppose add something called a class here of H1 let's say then if you want to you know uh um modify this specific class only then you put dot okay it's not relevant right now but just you know telling you I mean this class would come in the future video so don't you know worry about it anyways we see you know what we change what inside that we change and by how much we change or what is that to change okay nice similarly you can have the paragraph tag as well let's see that looks nice let's see we can increase the font size uh learn two great so this was you know basically the anatomy of cases intact selector property selection to what how much okay so in the previous video we learned about the anatomy of CSS right then we talked about you know um the prop the values the selectors and everything and we looked at how website looks let's just Collide here HTML okay let's close that and let's go right now okay so this is what it looks like all right now um in the previous video we came up with a with the problem right so um what I wanted was to change the colors of these two decks right I wanted this to be in black and I wanted this to be an uh accordingly but when I use the see here so both of these would get uh the same color so here the conclusion that is right what to do now so since till now we have talked about uh selectors which are just tags like H1 tag P tag all right but now we are going to look at more CSS selectors schools and you can see spot assist selectors you already know but let's read it again so uh basically selects the HTM element you understand all right now there are different type of CSS selectors okay uh you can divide the CSS selectors into five category so there are simple selectors then there are combinators pseudo class you do elements and attributes okay so if you go to combinator selectors you can see combinating something like expensive relationship between these characters so this would be I guess uh later too much for you okay so right now we are not going to talk about the combination one we'll talk it about any further coming videos but uh till then uh let's just talk about the simple selectors about in the simple selector we have only used the tag name okay so simple CSS selectors it contains ID and class okay so ID is used by a hashtag sign and class is used by a DOT okay we'll talk about how we'll do that okay and then there is a universal selected as well okay and the letters we talked about and yeah okay okay that is cool that is good right ah so let's just head back to our virtual Studio code and let's learn what we just ready so here we'll decide um ID okay and let's just name it and you will have a class which would be named black for now okay now here what uh we'll do we'll comment this so I hope you know what comment is so comment is basically a part of the code which is basically not executed or compiled so it is understood by the compiler that this is just for the documentation purposes and we don't need to compile this okay so it is by forward slash star and then you can have this chart again and forward slash okay okay that looks well okay let's talk about the universal directors the open Universal selector right now I'll just save it and then there is another warning okay now verified simply write uh font family on family is basically used for changing the font style so let's suppose with this right now back to save it okay battery only one okay okay okay okay okay okay okay um okay you don't see anything here but I don't know okay let's go here outside property okay that is in one on great uh let's just go back here you have saved it let's uh let's just go here okay let's just observe this now we'll go back to it again you can have sequence things happening uh let's have it okay okay it is still not changing I'm still not sure why is that happening let's just go to the grocery schools okay let's try it for ourselves um you don't feel that there are the things why are we not having that thing yeah okay let's copy it from here and it's just PS2 okay it's still not working let's just go to selector back again Universal selector is like this only okay let's just do one thing let's just try to put the color here for now and let's just say I'm not black let's say true let's hear it let's just go here uh this thing is working oh that's the blue color back here my family it's just try the point I'm leaving again or let's just separated okay you don't see that at all you can check the phone from everything on your own on your own system Maybe uh we'll see what it is all right so okay right never mind uh we're talking about friends so let's have one thing here uh let's have the class which was back okay and here we have the color as black okay let's save it and let's just have ID foreign what's the problem now okay let's save it this is in Black so both are the same paragraph type but ID and classes these are the main selectors you can you know um select and then uh code code snippet and style it accordingly all right so I guess the symbol collectors was all this video are in the next video we'll talk about the difference between class and ID and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in this video we are going to talk about Ides versus Plus okay so I hope you remember how we use class how we use class and how we use ID just to give you a quick recap uh we type class we give it some class name and we use dot for that okay and for simple like for ID views hashtag ID register for now okay great we can just remove everything from here and I'll remove this class as well we'll just start a fish let's see what happens okay simple nothing nothing important here okay great now you might think that okay idea like they have similar functions right but remember they are not the same and they do not always share the same purpose okay if I talk about um where's my star okay now what if I talk about IDs so first point is that each element can have only one ID okay suppose this is my header and there are two IDs let's say um samplement sample two sample one sample 2 and if I save it and let's just say I write hashtag sample one and hashtag sample two yeah this is how it would work right and suppose here I give it font size 1.5 REM and here I give it color aqua let's see now if I go back to the website and if I refresh see nothing happened why because each element can have only one ID according to our compiler sample one page sample 2 is a single ID both are not treated as different IDs so suppose if I write class here and I just now if I go back to a site see it changed right so that is one difference between them let's just put let's just leave it okay then second Point uh which would be here would be each page can only one element with that ID okay now this is like you can have like that okay let me just show you what I'm talking about it's intuitive okay hashtag sample two uh let's remove this part let's say ID okay okay if I go back to the website both are converted right but here what we said each page can have only one element with that ID but this is like a practice for us like this is a good practice for us I mean we should give only variety to one element okay it's not like you cannot use it multiple times you can but it was made for such a purpose all right okay I hope you understood that and what else is the difference obviously ID uses hashtag okay now if I talk about classes classes you know you can use same class or multiple elements that are in the practice we use dot in the class and you can use multiple classes on a single element not like this and classes are like there is a rule for writing class uh uh let me just say you can not have a class name with a space Act positive space con compiler would think that both are different classes which we just sorted here right okay so that was another example and play yes that was all the difference between IDs and classes like these three differences are there and one of these differences there okay and I'm again telling you this line each page can have only one element with that ID it is not a rule it is basically a practice which is used by most of the developers and you should follow the same okay so I guess that was all for this video hello everyone and welcome you all to another video of our web develop series so for the past few videos we have in talking about you know CSS we talked about the introduction to it we talked about the selectors we talked about the anatomy and few other stuff right if I just go live this is what our website looks like I mean we talked about different things here right so that is there so in this video or like I should say from this video onwards we'd be working on um website uh personal website basically I mean it's not going to be a simple uh TV website which we made there because they it was a very basic one right I mean if someone sees it they won't find it very attractive or anything like that right so that is there now let's go back to here and let's see what exactly we are going to make so this is one of the websites which I personally liked very much so this guy name is Sean helping all right this is his website and you can see this cover page it looks uh really nice here like see this is written here right um and you can see there are other users like it's a very neat website right there are different stuff here and there as well so yeah all in all there are many stuff which is available here okay so so in this video we are like try to imitate this website and make it our own all right so before we do we do that uh few things for me I'll just clear my sheets here okay first thing is just give me a minute okay I don't remember them let's go back here let's see how to add comments in HTML okay so this is the way all right so first step is uh create a new folder and writers my personal page okay then I want you to create an index. HTML okay then add color plate title your name whatever it is uh create style.css and link both of them and add blue background color so this is a task okay try and do it okay so for this you don't try to do whatever the steps I told you all right so here I'll go with my explanation We'll add the boilerplate I mean this this and this is already done with me so I just start from here I have added the boilerplate I'll just add the title so my name is so I'll just do that I'll save it and then what I have already likes I created this childhood CSS as well so you just do it on your own and then you have to basically link them so just laying and HFS style.css now here Simply Red body background color as blue saved okay my bad yeah okay so there's the shoes that we have successfully um created a sheet and linked them all right now now another thing I want to talk to you guys is um before going deep into you know making the site there's something I want to talk about as favicons so you can see here at the Sean's site got a little I couldn't write here right um so how to do that so what you have to do is write okay IO all right uh let's just go here let's have the text as yes right that works so this is 42 you know look like okay I will simply go and click on download so just showing folder um let's just try to open this one okay looks well if I open this one okay then what is this one exactly all right so what I'll do I'll just simply cut this all right let's go to the web def folder and I'll just paste it here I'll just save it okay now what I'll do I'll go here what I'm going to do I'll simply click on link this time link is not relative style sheet it's icon and it is right let's save it let's go here and you can see we got that beautiful icon right there with the name so you can have different things I mean you can go here you can add some emojis text PNG or something all right so that works now there is another thing that this uh might not work on some of the cases so what you have to do here is just change the relationship to favicon save it okay I mean see this would not work for me but it would work for you then all right and here what you have to do okay you might be wondering what is all this stuff so I would not go into detain over these things all right this is about basically the caching system which I don't uh thing is necessary for you to learn in this course so yeah here we go back now there's another thing you might see on Sean subsiders that it has got you know different divisions like see this division is a different thing then it got different divisions here and there and everything the positionings and everything I don't think so we have talked about right so in the next video we are going to talk about um how to you know add these divisions to which we can style differently and add different blocks in our code all right so many more to come uh in the next video so thank you for thank you for watching this video and see you later and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series so in the previous video we learned that we are going to make a new project on CSS along with it read learn a few Concepts as you will all right so if I do one thing if I go live we see what exactly I have with so till now we have you know basically made our boilerplate and styling sheet and Link them and to uh uh you know check uh the linking if it is right or not we have added a blue color right here okay so for now I'll just remove this look uh okay so now I just you know simply remove this all right so it is like this and then again one more thing was we have added an icon which is the fevicon which you can see right here okay cool now let's show one time let's try and implement this thing like what whatever is written here so you can see that this is an H1 and this figure paragraph so let's let's do the same thing here H1 sure then let's write a paragraph tag a programmer right okay so okay uh as you can see here and if you see here in a different right I mean in this website it looks like the both are enclosed Inside the Box and if we see here it looks like they are very different right so what is different areas athletes so let's just things click on inspect and see because it is but if you can see there's something called div okay now you might be wondering what div is exactly right so we will just go Dev MDM okay so Dev basically stands for Content division element all right now it development is the generic container for flow content okay so it has basically no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way okay it might be a little confusing for you but let me tell you what they will exactly do so if I want to Club these two together what I use I use it so tip basically helps us to you know divide our content into separate containers so that we can affect the layout of each of the containers differently all right so what I can do here is I can write there right and I can simply paste it here but if you see not much of a difference you might be wondering oh what is this right but let me tell you uh the Sony mdl docs if it is that it has no effect until in some way CSS is applied so we need to apply a CSS right now before we talk about the CSS part I want to mention a few things right here uh that would be that then we think of a basically stands from this corner to this corner and its height is equal to whatever the content is inside that thing all right that is a very important point which I wanted to mention in front of you because in the future videos we'll talk about span and then we'll see what is the difference between span and a disk all right okay so let's try and give a very nice background color to our text okay so before that we'll just simply go to color paper CSS okay okay it's not like this it was I don't remember exactly uh what the site's name was okay but it had a very nice one let's let's try color palette pick up for HTML okay let's see okay I remember it was colorant right okay okay uh these are the basic uh you know a very nice color palette which we can use this one all right so I'll simply copy this color copy it I'll simply come here I simply say class equal to dedics okay whoops and here I say details and Dragons the background color as okay yeah see okay this color is uh so I think I'm gonna choose let's color maybe and sorry guys I'll uh configure a little bit I have actually a little bit download code not anything is serious but yeah and yeah this looks far better right I mean this is visible color like that was a nice color but it was not visible on the right background but anyways uh let's let's continue okay so this is uh now if you look closely you might see that there is a gap here this is the gap pill under the Gap here as a what is this Gap exactly I mean I will use Dev nothing above anything to the left but then to the right by itself this is because our web browsers have here old styling so they I mean if I go to it's not Pages sorry for that I'm going to give go to inspect mobile expanded like this is not able to find that right now okay but never mind you can see that there is a gap how to reduce it so this is a very nice trick which I'm going to tell you so listen to it carefully all right you don't have to do anywhere simply uh right quality and here have the marginal zero we don't have actual and here margin top has zero save it let's see how okay everything looks perfect right yeah then there is a line content to Center let's see if it works I don't know what shop it doesn't enter content of them let's see how we do a project text align let's say Center let's see if it works now okay this is a start I mean this looks nice to me at least I told about remember this looks nice to me uh we have done a lot of things till now and in the last video we talked about uh development uh this okay then we see a website it looks something like this pretty nice I'd say and then we go to this website says what we're trying to make okay now uh in this video we're going to talk about Box model okay now you might be wondering what is the Box Water right so let's go to outside let's try it back only Box model should come all right so uh yeah okay everything okay this is what is called a box model okay so in HTML every element its own box if I write a paragraph tag it would have its own box all right so a box basically has three main attributes one is padding one is the Border Anonymous margin all right so one by one uh we are going to talk about each of those boxes and then we'll try to you know do something on our own to see how we see it all right if it makes sense to you okay so first we'll talk about the Border okay let's come here let's see what we can have uh okay we will draw it let me draw it suppose this is my box this is my development okay now this div element uh would have some border right right if I go here it would have some border where I now what would it look like because because there are some border like this okay anything in closing it it's called it border okay I hope it was a bit clear to you I held you okay now let's try and implement it let's see how it will look if you see it you would get it uh remove pattern understanding mode right away you know I order write solid and then we say order let's suppose okay I have a color as well that's I declare out this looks let's go to work right okay why can't you see the Border here okay since there goes the whole part let's have a height of 200 pixels for now and uh width of 200 pixels oh let's see we got it um yeah let's do one time let's see background color too black okay okay so the color was actually equal to the background color right now so that's why you couldn't see it but this is the background I mean the Border you're talking about it raise of 10 pixel highest color is black all right as it all and you can see the same thing is happening here okay now do you think which we'll talk about is uh adding so suppose there's some content written inside a box so the difference between the content and these both edges mean difference or that edge or this Edge or message it is called padding okay it is called padding so what uh we are going to do is we are going to have a padding here here of currently pixel let's save it um you can see that there's a padding around it I mean this is the content okay oh you might wondering okay there's not much of a change here what is the difference right that is what you might be wondering okay okay so let's just try to remove the body for now let's save it so let's see okay I can I see I mean I guess maybe it is different than me so guys simply add the padding there we go on demo then we go to border and the only thing that I've left is uh we need to talk about is uh module so margins a buffer zone okay it is this you know uh the test current element and any other element that is on our screen or suppose there is this box out there let's call it the Box only and the distance between them that is called the um okay so I hope this was clear to you okay hmm no okay so I told you about margin now there's one task which I would like to give you um okay so first thing you have to do is make one more container with the height and that as 200 pixel only okay then the second point would be uh to give it a red color the third thing would be change first I mean assign class to boot details then try or if you can't rewrite it but for now that is all you have to do okay so yeah I'm going to uh okay uh we can just change it to let's say first container so yeah and you will have class five second container and let's save it let's change it to let's go to the website to see if it working if it's working it is working now let's add second container we have high dashboard pixel we have with uh 200 pixel what else uh background color will have your okay let's do it let's see how our side looks now okay now one more thing I don't know if you might uh seen it or not but this is a total pixel box this is a 200 pixel box where is the difference make why am I getting uh so much High difference we'll talk about it this works it's easier inside container and everything the address to One Direction but because of the padding which is you know twenty twenty two hundred percent twenty that is 240 then I talked about the border that would be 10 10 260. so that makes it greater than I mean it's because it the box size isn't compromised when we had the padding or when we are at the border all right even when we add imagine a box size is not compromised okay so please see that in mind okay okay so anyway next thing we had to do was just introduce margin here now let's hit the table so yes um all of the sides there's there's this we are now separate margins as well um let's save it see I've got it from here no that's why I put the margin top of temperature as well between them becomes 20 pixel okay so this was the Boss model uh we had to talk about there we immediately had three mutants adding border and margin so far we have learned a lot of things right let's go live and see uh uh okay okay uh I've had let's close this um let's just go back here stop this for a while go to HTML and then we go live yeah Okay cool so we have like developed kinda few things right so far okay cool uh now the question arises uh exactly that our site is not looking like the Sean's site right I mean let's say it looks something like this which uh clearly doesn't so okay we'll try and do few things here to make our website look something like this let's go to style okay in the first container what I wanted just remove the border with and Border color for now okay okay then we have textile and background color okay rest all the things are fine okay something is still there which we don't want uh width is there let's move it let's let's have the padding let's remove the margin let's move the margin from here as well let's save it let's remove this solid border also let's save it okay um kind of works right I mean I can have the wet okay let's not have the bit right now okay cool okay now uh one thing I want to show you is uh this is my development project in the image I have two images uh one is cloud okay looks like this and one is Mountain which looks like this you can download your old images from the all right I the way I did it all right uh now I get back to here uh what I want here is I'll go to simple HTML um in the this part um I have this uh two sentences and below this sentence I want an image tag okay Source would be images scale nothing like this what is this Images slash uh let's have the cloud one let's save it we'll have Cloud image okay and similar thing we'll have here as well okay and then below this uh we'll have same mountains and we'll save it and we'll say Mountain image for now okay okay works let's see how it looks uh definitely we are looking for uh what is wrong here exactly um let's just remove the height as well now let's see okay okay and another thing which we can have here is uh sorry yeah here is let's remove the text Line to Center as well okay okay let's save it just give me a minute okay this this looks uh nice and I I mean we have the images not looking nice okay it's looking very houses now you might be wondering why one thing is um which I don't know is bugging to you but it is bugging to me is I have this Cloud here and then I have the sentences but here I have the cloud and adjacent to it is the mountain image so what is these what is this thing exactly what is the difference here okay so the diff uh I mean differences because of the display okay let's now go and try to read the display so display is a CSS property which sits within an element is treated as block or inline okay and the layout is used for okay that is something different but what you should be know is how it is seated block or inline let's just click here block or inline uh okay they don't have it here I'll just tell you what is the blocker and what is an inline okay suppose here I write H1 hello world H1 okay now if I have the color as red I mean it is World here and it should be like uh background color here you can see that this I mean the text is here but it is taking the whole this thing right so what is this called so this is basically called a block element which you know blocks the whole uh area not just the text all right similar thing is the paragraph tag as well para have to say and we'll just close it with this okay okay okay then I have the power attack I will back crown color let's say blue okay so you can see block elements you know blocking the whole area right so that is one of the displays called block okay another of the display is called uh span ah sorry another three displays called inline an example of a line could be a span okay now I'm wondering what is a span so let's just try writing span okay I mean yeah I'll simply write hello world again and I'll just close this fan okay and I'll just have this thing I'll have the background color copied from here only another space set okay great work right I mean you can see that uh span is an like if we write span and if we try to format it it is not you know uh encapsulating the whole block it is only encapsulating the content written inside it so this type of display is called inline display okay create create now you might be thinking like okay span is working fine then why do we need a block display elements I mean what is the need there so need is there I mean suppose I want the width not to be changed I said 100 pixels right but suppose I want the width here to be 100 pixel it has 100 pixel width right so that is the thing here okay oh you mind wondering okay everything is working fine everything is cool all is good but the thing which is bugging me is if I want to use the powers of both um block and ni what can I do so CSS gives us the ability to adjust our display okay I just simply write display and I can write inline see cool trick right so this brings me to the third type of display which is in line ok here you can adjust the height let's say 100 pixel see so this gives you the advantage of both the cases all right so this is how you can see that how elements are you know adjusted in our web page using CSS okay uh the Box model contributes to it the display contributes to it and a few other things which we'll talk about it so I hope you learned something in this video about the display the blog display inline display online block display and one more uh very uh what should I say informative tag which is the span tag all right so I guess that was all for this video and in the previous video we learned about um uh elements of like block elements and inline elements and how we can you know change the position okay and what else uh we talked about the positioning as I mentioned uh all right and and did we talk about anything else no that was it okay so in this video we are going to talk more about how you know we position the element exactly okay so but before we do so the first thing we have to realize is that even without CSS an HTML element has some positioning by default okay and we have to understand how things you know get positioned by default before we can go and change it to bend the rules okay so the first rule is that content is everything okay suppose here I have a let's say I have a diff uh hello and here I have a span okay and if I write the div let's do this and I have this one let's see okay so we can see that okay in div in Span the content is like this okay it just encapsulates the whole content in the table also like it's fine that the it has the whole block like this but the height is in accordance to the element only so that's why the first rule is that um content is everything all right the second rule I would say is children sit on parents okay now I'm wondering what I mean by that exactly so suppose I just remove the hello from here okay and here I have height say 100 pixel and let's say with 100 pixel as well for now okay and if I have this pan inside this div so div is a parent and span would be the child all right so you can see that our span or a child sits on the parent right so that is what children said on the parents mean so these are the basic two rules of positioning okay now uh we can also you know set CSS property like other than the positional thing okay uh I mean other than this position or nothing um like the default position thing we can also write a CSS property which is position property in order to position elements on okay so basically there are two position properties static and relative so let's talk about the static so okay we have talked about this article because this default HTML thing I'm in positioning of how how how this would be positioned how this would be positioned how this would be positioned is um simple static um all right and if I talk about the relative one uh relative positioning is uh basically how uh you would you know a positional element relative to how absolute it was okay I don't know if it made sense to you but let's try something and then we'll be able to I guess would be able to get it what I'm trying to say here so okay I'm giving you a task make three divs of a square diff of 100 by 100 and give them colors of red blue and yellow okay pause the video and do it oh yeah meanwhile I'm gonna do it let's say the class has read okay okay this works right now let's just now let's have the blue one let's do something let's just copy this thing and we'll just paste it uh change the color to Blue okay and let's uh let's paste it change the color to yellow okay okay cool now suppose I changed the position to um sorry position to relative okay and now I put the top to 20 pixels you see this element be here according to the it's static position but since it is a relative position it would you know shift to 20 pixels downward from the top uh whether friends to the absolute position and the one of the major thing is that other elements would still be at their absolute position so if I simply just say 100 pixels good you know come down here and the other element would just you know uh vanish okay so this is all that we have to talk about the positioning absolute answers and how default positioning is done by HTML okay so far in the couple of previous videos you learned about the positioning of elements in our um website right we learned about inline elements we learned about block elements we learned about inline block element we learned about the fixed position and the absolute position and the relative position all right so let's do one thing let's go live here and try to see what we have achieved so far okay okay let's remove this red box I don't know why it is still there now let's see uh Okay cool so this is what our website uh looks like currently okay now uh one thing which I think we can have is all we can have all these elements towards the center right that is one of the bare minimum so to do that we have text align as I told you which we can have in the body all right let's hit enter let's see how it looks hmm okay great now one thing I want to tell you is if we inspect it um yeah you can see that all the text uh which are aligned or I mean see it's just as a cloud okay let's have it I mean other than the image all the things which are aligned like this so these are basically the uh block element all right like they have the full block like this right the whole inline thing is right suppose um I change the width to 10 percent now what will happen see as soon as it gets upload it becomes a block element um yeah it becomes a block element the texture line uh don't work on it so what is like what can we do here what we can do here is we can have the margin top would be zero uh right would be Auto bottom would be zero and left will be orders okay now if you check it uh this is how you Center all right so this was all uh about you know centering how is internal element so these two are the main methods by which we can Center the element all right all right so I'll just um removed from here for now let's check back to what we had okay great now another thing which you might be noticing is that this mountain is not flying in the center because of um This Cloud right um This Cloud basically is like a hindrance right so we have to you know remove this uh cloud from the HTML flow so whenever I uh remember how we take an element of of the HTML Flow by changing one particular CSF property and yes that is of course the position property that we are going to change all right um now let's try to see uh what we can change here exactly okay let's do one thing uh this is the cloud um I'll give it a class call bottom Cloud okay uh let's move this is good and I'll say bottom cloud and simply I have this position absolutely why there is no difference here okay okay okay hmm this is our first container so let's have the uh position here as related okay and let's have the left of what okay um 50 victors okay okay I'm not sure why this thing is not working uh um there is a probably sometime which we are missing um what can it be what is that one thing which we are nothing let us check the name if it is correct it's bottom cloud okay I mean one of the most reading mistakes but okay okay I mean uh it is uh something not one thing you want but it is okay but this is because we don't he should not be having what should not be happening uh suppose I just say 10x what difference would it bring let's see okay let's say 300 because um okay and left me I'll say 300 pixel okay right so yeah okay let's have it 400 pixel looks pretty nice right so my next challenge will be to ha let's make it 400 as well let's see how it would look I mean it depends all on you okay not 400 400 will look nice let's say 350. now let's see let's see okay I mean for me it works I mean I can have it to 330 okay that works for me that was really fine for me okay now I want you I want to give you guys a challenge to move this uh I'm Legit forgetting the words right now but yeah let's move this Cloud somewhere here okay let's have some padding over here right uh first container let's have some adding top let's handle pixel you see let it work Ed on holding let's see clear scenes back let's see while we're working Cloud I should be adding here um okay we're having some baggage okay we'll talk about the body thing later but um I'm glad like you understood and just try to move this from here to here somewhere hmm so what what what we can do is uh we can have classes okay what about because we kind of closed there obviously a cloud um we have the position again as absolute um what we can have more would be let's have top of papers right and I'll write as okay let's see how it looks okay where this mountain is a little bit far so we should be having this model a bit far as well so let's have a left task in pixel as well works okay so now you guys tell me how it looks I mean for me it looks better and I a little bit um what is this uh let's write show okay it's looking a little bit like this right so okay that's a good start on the next video we would be trying to change the font here because because of the positioning changes sometimes it should see all about in the next video hello everyone and I welcome you all to another video of our web development series and in the last video we learned about the what I call this Dark Art of centering elements using CSS all right we did it using two methods and we learned about um what we say uh absolute positioning as well and if I go live this is what my website looks like it looks pretty neat to me at least all right so I mean I'll give that to me that this looks nice okay uh now what I would be going to talk about is these texts right uh which I already talked about how to I mean I am going to talk about them right so yeah let's let's uh just start with that all right great okay now there are basically two phone families one is a difference between settlements answer is these tiny legs which are present in the serif but are present in these answerers okay now let me let's just try with the example let's have one family there kind a lot but uh main are sensor let's see how it looks okay where is my website who gets there so we'll see there are no little legs there and there so there is that then we have Sarah let's see how it looks see the little X okay then what else we have we have one space right I mean monospace has every letter have you know like equal gap between them then let's see I mean it looks a bit terrible right and there is one fantasy as well if I remember correctly okay this looks really bad so these are the basic font families then um we talked about science events array so sansar event serif has basically like these upon families so there are definite fonts present in them right so let me show you some things let's say for family I will say uh cancel it for now let's see how it looks it looks like it okay then there is under the fan serif only and it looks something like this okay so I okay one more thing is uh you are seeing all these things right like you might be wondering okay what the hell is this right okay so you might be a little bit uh short Thriller but I mean the first time when I read about it I was true okay so this is basically uh all these fonts may or may not be present on someone's computer I mean see it's not present on megaboot I mean uh this one is present on my computer but there is a high possibility that this might not be present on yours all right then what would happen look for this if not it would look for this if not it would look for this and if not silencer refers I mean it is right about that so this is you know a safely by versus like being very specific and love being very gentle okay so let's start that is all we have to talk about the porn family now another very pretty thing which I want to talk to you guys is I mean suppose you are a person who is very specific and won't start whatever font you are seeing on your screen should be visible to the other person so how to do that okay so I would recommend you to go to phone sort Google okay google.com let's see okay I don't know exactly full let's see yeah let's try to get an alternator let's go to font awesome I don't wanna learn right now I'm not able to find it where did it go exactly let's try let's check okay it has been there what what was I even doing here okay phones.com uh you can search it from there um create now something I wanted let's say Merryweather I want this one all right a little over here uh the regular one okay right now okay we have something then let's have another one which I like I like it is my personal favorite if I come in two okay I haven't already worked it selected for now more turns yeah we don't have the Sacramento is there okay okay now let's write um that okay I got hurt what I was doing there just don't mind me let us select the regular okay yeah and do I need something else um let's have monster that as well for that let's have the 400 and let's see what is now the simple thing is copy this link okay let's go to your HTML let's paste it that is it now suppose was the body I want uh presently pass it and here I'll do what I'll have the Sacramento I just copy it and I'll just pick and for H2 which I don't have currently but I will have it future and it's three I'll have the font family and what's that um let's just paste it and Here Also let's just patient that's it now if I go to my website okay this looks uh trading design domain right this is the Sacramento one this is the normal um right so that of all I have to talk about default all right so I hope you like this video you learned a lot through this and I hope you apply this in your budget as well so far we have learned a lot of things right and I mean you know basics of CFS then learned Advanced or I would say intermediate CSS as such which included a lot of things okay in centering data difference between them and span and how to style a text okay so in order to you know style our text or to change the text property and go to exclude more ways of silent attacks we have to have more content on our website okay uh if you go live right now this is what our website looks like but we need more content here all right so what to do okay so I have something for you um let's just close it yeah okay I have something for you code file all right I'll put the description in the uh sorry I haven't delete all this thing in the description and you can download it from there so you don't want them you open it and what we are going to do here left contains something like metal container and okay whatever content you want to do you just copy it and Below first maintainer just paste it okay so yeah that is what you have to do and let's just save it and let's see what else it looks like okay now your momentary what is this right so this is some text which we have here okay here we put in information of ourselves and I tell you what we'll put but first of all let's try and understand what is like everything written here so in the Metro container what we have we have a profile you can add your image here or any image you want and then we have a Hello and then we have this Laura mixed symptom or something something so it is a very I have to create time to tell you what it means let's just write our website and it's taking a bit okay I mean I don't know hydrogenics was so much time we'll get through one thing let's go to settings and let's just change the search engine to Google okay and now let's okay it hasn't changed why let's see let's go together and okay but foreign and there you have something close it and close it from here and let's go live go ahead and get back and here you can see what is Laura lips um it is it's a tummy text from the printing and typeset Industry Okay so what happens basically is when you design a website um you know that you would have be having some content over there like you would be having some content over here or some content over here some content over here but what exactly you don't know at that time so to happen so you have Tamil content uh over like as a placeholder and later you can you know just modify it uh printed on the placeholder all right so that is there all right now let's let's do one thing let's try and add some photos here I mean there's a very famous website called Flat icons where you can get Vector images okay and there are like hundreds of icons just go on V1 and you can see like there are hundreds and hundreds of icons present here and you can choose any one of them so suppose I go with Avatar job description looks fine I go over here what I do um let's pick this photo let's just download the PNG it has downloaded right okay go in a folder so what we'll do is copy it if you go to our web page in the menu folder we just place it okay looks great now what we'll do we'll come back here in the middle container in this you can have images this is my PG let's save it let's see how the website looks now okay I mean uh before me needing this you go for picture who will try a little bit let's just say class circles allow okay we go to our style and here I have a good okay and I have the modern radiograph uh 50 percent all right now find me the website hmm okay monetary okay okay it was a good straight it has got a round figure but it's not much of a round so let's say okay let's have the width as 100 pixels and why it has 100 pixel as well now let's see how it looks hmm looks nice right and instead of this you can any other image you can find on the flat icon and you can just simply paste it I mean just copy the image here okay okay great similarly um We Have Skills section as well okay I have a skills photo here like let's say I go back here okay which I'm liking I'll just simply here coding I'm like nothing okay this is not something I would be needing I have to do something from here so let's say I choose this one looks like I'll just download it what I'll do I'll go in the folder okay show my folder uh I just cut it and I'll just paste it over here and I saved and I'll um close it now here what I have uh here I have these four images file extension and make love answer circles I'll save it now let's see what it looks like I mean it looks amazing to me at least we have some other picture over here like whatever you want but for now I have the same one okay and create now okay looks amazing and then the last container we have contact me phone type where you can mail to wherever you want let me just type in my mail ID okay then in the bottom container you can have different links and here you can have a name and surname as a copyright thing that is attend my name now if I go back to my website this is what we have got so far I mean we can increase a bit over here let's say 200 let's say we create if that looks amazing right now this is me so I would put my photo over here you can have a photo here you can give a small introduction over here for now I have just GTA me text was I'm just showing it to you right and again same text over here something something here then get in touch something some things will be something then contact me mail your social profiles uh URL you can have in your copyright photo so I've got a lot of content over asking now which we format or change the properties in the upcoming video and in the previous video we copy the code from the subco file which I I told you in the previous video okay now if I click on go live uh we can see that we have got something here play we have got the content now we can try and talk about them all right now one thing I want to talk about you guys is on science okay suppose I want this thing to be the created suppose okay I mean I want it to be more greater than everything like move it around the H1 standard size so that like because you ultimate heading thing all right so what what that what we'll do what we'll do is we'll go here in this one I am going to have alt file 90 pixel why is it up let's say 50 pixels great it looks a lot bigger and everything uh uh if I say 0.3 okay so it looks a lot nicer right create but uh we have like mentioned it in pixel but there is one another um Dimension em before talking about em let us see like what is like why don't mean pixel suppose I go to settings I go to appearance and in the font size which is the medium which is recommended I click on large now if I come here uh you'll notice okay let's do it very large be great so one thing you might have noticed is 5 of this text has not been changed by size of this text I got this checked everything has changed so cool right click on the medium now you can see that yeah but here the size is not inch why is that because when we declare a font size and pixel we have like fixed that thing okay like that in the static value to have it in and dynamic we use em okay so let me tell you what is em first so El okay um sound of M so in uh previous uh Time 1 em was equal to yes and five or l okay but in the modern days one em is equal to 16 pixel okay now if I change this part because I want it to be an enemies by 16. which would come roughly to 5.625 here okay do that same size okay create everything let's cook now another property I want to talk about um EMS um if someone have one size here but one size is a basically no derived value suppose here will be body I have a font size of 2 am and there are so H1 inside body H1 parent is body right if I have font size in the body and if I have a font size in H1 this font size would become equal to 5.625 plus just 2 okay so if I go here you can see okay it looks very very right all right but there is not a very you know like this is a small code so you can see uh check whose parents have got what size but in big codes it is very hard to debug this thing so in order to have this value to be on its own and not to be derived we use something called REM okay R stands for root so if I put this value great so are you basically impact it is gonna add the font size present in the body I mean in the parent part all right great so I guess we talked about font size here and there's one of the most uh important and crucial parts we should be known between different pixels EMA and Ariens all right so okay and so far um let's look at the website which we have created uh look something like this where it looks nice right oh great okay something um I want to have you there is in the body let's remove this it's looking too big but that right now if I go here yeah it looks much smaller than you better okay okay great now I would like to in this video uh try and um have a skills and some nice way okay I mean to format it you know so for formatting uh one thing I would like to have is let's have the inspect okay uh Lindy class row you can see that we have two divs for two different eight anymore great now since it is like having the whole 50 I mean 100 width I wanted to change the width to 50 okay this is your first challenge for the video and try it okay now if I talk about if I want to try what I'll do is I will go on scale through make sure it matches the name here okay and here you can have with us 50 save it and see how it looks okay holder you can see it has a 50 percent is left great now another thing which I wanted to send but Center these shapes in the matter for that we learned about the margin let's say Auto let's save it in the margin I mean at a fancy Center but I'm not liking this part all this space I need to have some spacing so try another 100 pixel margin on top and bottom and leave the left and right to uh Auto so pause the video and try it so if I have to do it what I'll do I'll write 100 pixel and if I go clockwise it would be right so Auto and then again bottom would be 100 pixel and then again would be Auto if I save how would it look hmm I mean I got the margin here and here so it looks pretty wings now another thing which I want from you guys is to have this text in the left part not in the center part so here we have the text align effector but here I want to have the text aligners left for that you know you can simply write text line left and what it would do it would override they are text line to feel so if I look at it looks something like this okay great now now what else what else is and you can see that there's no much space here right so what to do on this thing like I want to have some space here so what we can have here is we can have uh line height or two okay you can see the difference see there is some like line height difference and it looks uh pretty better than before okay okay one thing I didn't tell you in the previous video you can use these stickers but show you the lots are they can be used here go to Jiffy or click on be animated and here you can write code okay for the green and click on the second spot let's see what stickers we can get from here fight is a bit slow if I click on scales let's see what it shows me um okay I don't know why I got the images are not opening okay but um okay there's a lot of thing at all I don't know what the problem is see it at the end of the video we'll see if the stickers get loaded we'll try and inculcate it otherwise we'll go with this image cool so far we have formatted our skills set a bit but I want to do one time which would look totally cool but it is not right now so I want to wrap these texts around here okay and then I should be here and this text should wrap it or somewhere around here how to achieve that so for that let me just reduce it to say 25 percent okay and Here Also let's do 25 percent I don't know I mean obviously we cannot activate but let's see hey looks nice so for that what we do is we learn about uh new answer called float okay just go float CSS property and see what it is exactly so close property specifies whether an element should float left right or not at all all right so absolutely positioned elements ignore the flow property so rather than seeing any running with Theory let's go for B uh learning it in Practical all right float and I feel like and if I save it but how is float day okay that's why we had a problem foreign it's back okay okay uh pretty much not what we need not getting the correct among stickers here I would say let's just say I recorded we'll let it go on its own can we come back here what we will do we will have some other class here let's say kill image and here also I'm going to have 12 image okay and if I go here what I'll do I'll have till image okay I have these two things and then I'm going to have root left okay only through one time I'll have skill image one and climate Studio I'll tell you why I am doing this let's see so this is what I was talking about see if all texts are wrapping this text around okay but I see that there's no Gap here so how to have a gap here so what we can do we can simply have uh margin from the left of 100 pixel okay not from left from right great now see looks nice right now like new comments for you would be to have this part to something similar like this but this image should come here and the text should be somewhere here we get an image okay cool so can you do that for me try it so what you can do is you can do skill image to you can have these things okay and in the float you can have right okay and margin and on the right should be 50 pixel now let's see create okay how awesome does this look right the MySQL section is looking something like this and another parts coming here like looks really great right and one more thing which we can have and we can have this color on all the paths that would look great right okay we want something how about this suppose I just copy that I just came here and from here if I please set and save it let's see did we get it three doesn't it look wonderful right you can have some other image on the second part as well uh what say what's I would say I mean this looks nice and just copy this uh don't tell me we have to wait again but okay we can wait and by the end of this lecture I mean two or three minutes and we can get these sequence so let's wait for that time but okay we want to have this color here so what we'll do we'll check watercolor was required steps you simply copied and put it in the background it looks nice to me at least and I hope you guys also make it great um so many images but yeah you can add this one if I try to be shipped yeah it would look good when you it's not looking very nice over here right so let's move that image let's have some other image so we can do one thing you can have the Border radius I have let's say 60 percent and let's have that see it now yeah looking much better okay so so far I mean I'm liking what have done and we learned about the float and we learned about you know these stickers which we can use great we learned our report property as well so yeah I mean that move it which I wanted you guys to know here all right and one thing which we can have this between the here we can have HR tag okay great and okay I'm not getting okay let's see what which are thickness how we can have HR click and CSS let me go to Charcoal move check uh then height add one pixel let's say char and see okay nothing much happened let's try and just copy this part let's see how it would look foreign all right let's click on go live and see what we have created so far so okay great so this is what it looks like right nice now I want to uh you know I've planned something that this video and next video most probably uh we'll have you know I'll uh walk you uh through this like site or through some styling which I'm going to do and I would highly recommend you to you know follow me along this these two videos we are talking about minute menu changes which you are going to put on our site to look at more presentable than it is right now all right so yeah let's let's try and do this great cool now uh before I talk about anything um what I want is uh right now I want your text color to be a little grayish okay I mean you can see the text color it is little black but if it is a little grayish that I could look cool right so the code for that would be four zero um 514 e okay I save it I go and I see yeah I mean it's not much of a change but it looks nice all right and then on H1 and H2 I want a little different color you can have any color of your choice but what I am thinking is a little of aqua okay our non H2 I am thinking of having the same okay on H3 as well great now if I go back hmm looks nice right uh what else we can have here is okay now um we go dehyde and everything now what I want is to have a gap between these two I mean this cap and you know this Gap there's no gap between you know bottom container and middle container middle container and top container so put the Gap I am going to go on the uh what have I named it here middle container right so I don't think I have any middle container here so I'll just have one middle container it is filling okay that's fine okay let's try and try the middle container we'll go for margin we want top margin to be hundred pixel we don't want any left margin so it would be Auto bottom margin would be 100 pixels and then again Auto great now if we go back looks nice right now one more thing I want is uh here we have class are so good if I check what is so good this is fine but I want to change the height as well let's say net pixel okay loaded Holland pixel let's remove this let's have with 500 pixel height and 100 pixels now let's go and see okay it looks a bit small so let's make it 200 now we go check perfect great looking nice right now another thing which I want would be I mean c this route I it is a single long line it is not looking nice at least not to me so what I am thinking of doing here is like I'll give it a class I'll say intro I save it and here I'll have a intro and here I'm going to have width as let's say 40 percent let's save it let's see okay look fill looks better but we want to be on Center so here we'll have the margins as Auto and yeah this is how it looks it's nice agreed great great great great uh what else we can have here is okay no no no no what else uh we can have on our website to make it look better like kind of thing okay we can change this this long line doesn't look nice so for this thing we are going to try something okay this is a standard code so just uh we not remember it but try to understand it okay we're going to have dotted we are going to have a thickness as X pixel and here we have color which would be Gray would look like and let's save it if I go that looks something like this it looks not very nice but it is what it is now the Border bottom has to be zero because we want only single line or none okay if I go single line I don't want so many dots so I can have with uh like four percent that would work okay looks nice and margin here should be 100 pixel from the top 0 pixel Auto from the left 100 pixel from the bottom and auto from the right let's save it let's see okay looks nice right yes great work great work now okay I'll give you a challenge like this has been made I want you guys do it exactly what we did here okay so I would like um suggest you guys to try this thing okay this would look nice so try it okay if I go here I check in the bottom what is there as such no class has been assigned to it so we'll assign a class bottom okay and you are going to have Dot bottom this is what I have written okay great now this was the code I copy it and paste it here save it if I go back looks nice right but it doesn't have you know or I mean the whole margin is auto that's why I guess the problem is so let's do one thing let's have Auto 100 pixel Auto and let's see it now okay let's have it at 60. hmm let's have it as 40. 40 pixels sorry yeah looking great right now the last thing I want you guys to understand in this video is we have to change this contact me button okay for that we have something CSS button generator okay if you go to this website you can have your button as your own okay now here I want not click me but I want contactly font is five or we can have this one you can choose your own color we for me this would look nice it hasn't changed okay font size fine box everything's fine border I would like to change it to 8 so that it gets a square shape all right and background this works fine however I don't answer we need anything in the hover part okay so let's just copy this whole code from here okay and then we are going to paste it here simply just paste it now you go to HTML and you see your I mean it has button only so if we go to a website now I'll see button okay great looks nice right now you can change the color here on your own pose I want to have the same color which we are having here let's just copy it and just try and paste it okay I mean color is different I don't think we can find it but three color is different right so yeah so I mean we have I mean we did a lot of things in this video okay we had some height I mean patterns we have this cute little dots we made this contact me button we centered the textures like this and everything so yeah everything looks cool so I guess that was all for this video at least and in this and if you remember in the previous video we styled our website Google let's see okay uh my bad let's just close this just go back here don't show again and now let's play okay we added these underlines and what else we added this button okay great now one thing which I did was I changed the color of our lower part two simple white and this part of t one which was there previously okay so in this video all we are going to do is we are going to talk about the footer part in order challenge put a part one thing uh that is concerning me here practice but it looks little out of place right because of the font so what can we do simply we can do one thing um style.css or you just copy this and yeah we are just going to paste it and save it on now but it looks pretty nice no uh if we have to format the footer part so it's class with bottom retainer so we have bottom container and here I'm going to have my um background color I have six um call background color uh background colors yeah nice this is the same color which we are using for the font um it looks something like this nice oh one thing you must what is this that you can see this thing we have the map why is that already told you that web pages by themselves sign Auto margins so how to cover that exactly we can cover them with adding so let's have a top adding a 50 pixel okay um left radical zero bottom parting is 25 and and left adding a few okay and we'll see looks nice so it is there now another thing which I want to change is these uh anger tags so what we're going to do is call the anchor attacks let me explain yeah okay so for the anchor tags what we can do here we can first of all change the color of the text to let's say one one okay now if you go back you can see it looks nice you need a little same to the color but I actually prefer this when using the links all right now you can see that we have these underlines which I don't want so these underlines are as you know already provided by a HTML for the Android apps to remove that we can use the text decoration so let's uh text integration of let's say okay great now uh there is no gap between them so let's put some gap between them it's full Gap you know we have to put the margin let's have the top margin of Centerview uh right margin of 25 if I go back and look yeah looks looks better rate the only thing left is to have the phone family we are going to have this phone family only and we'll save it now sorry yeah it looks pretty nice right the only thing which is left is I don't I mean a few user comes on the website he won't be able to recognize that what is this right I hope you remember that if you can just switch over and watch the videos so we have this thing over we never ordered I want the color to be more a bit wide shadow fight which is e a f 6 S6 okay now you want to look and you see look great all right already know what to do right left is to have the copyright part so for that let's just see if we have something okay we don't have any plus so let's add a class here let's name as copyright okay and let's our copyright 20 okay now first of all I want the color so we can have the same color uh the white one looks pretty neat looks nice right now I want this text to be reduced the contrast will be reduced it's a 0.6 75 am okay 3 4 of 16 pixels right so it looks nice bit small and I wanted to be at the bottom so to get it at the bottom I have to have padding so padding will be what we go bottle retina the bottom padding is 20 pixels so we can have the upper binding of some difficult as well then right zero pixels and save it I mean let me check and it looks nice right so well I guess that was on which we could do this inside it looks pretty nice to me you have a nice you know starting page I mean starting what did I say this um welcome thing let's just call it to your company then we have our intro you know obviously as for yourself then we have these and then we have contact okay and then we have a link and our copyright oh I guess start overall which was to be taught in this video and congratulations your website is completed details at your get a page you can you know show it to the people you want it's cool all these things the circles and everything it looks good from this part I can proud is there you are done with your intermediate CSS skills so attach on your back and from the next video onwards we would look into bootstrap all right so I won't get into bootstrap in this video at all from the next video only we will talk about bootstrap what is bootstrap and how we would inculcate it in our fights of it so thank you for watching this video and see you later
