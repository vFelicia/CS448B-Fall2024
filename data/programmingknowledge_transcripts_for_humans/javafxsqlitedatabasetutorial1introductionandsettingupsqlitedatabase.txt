00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners using
00:05 - SQLite database in this video series I
00:08 - will start with creating a Java effects
00:11 - project and I'm going to connect it with
00:13 - SQLite database and then further we will
00:17 - move towards creating a login page using
00:20 - SQLite in JavaFX and how we can insert
00:25 - delete or update data in SQLite database
00:28 - using JavaFX
00:30 - and in the later videos we will also see
00:33 - how we can use SQLite and jar effects
00:37 - controls like buttons or text text boxes
00:40 - or tree view or list view or combo box
00:44 - with SQLite database now in this first
00:48 - video I will start with creating a new
00:50 - SQLite database and we will download a
00:54 - SQLite jar which is required to connect
00:59 - to SQLite database using JavaFX
01:03 - ok so let's get started now there are
01:06 - many ways of creating SQLite database on
01:10 - your Windows operating system or on
01:12 - Linux or Mac OS what I like is I would
01:17 - like to have a plug-in in my Firefox
01:20 - browser which allows me to create a
01:23 - SQLite database using a SQLite manager
01:28 - which it provides so what I'm going to
01:31 - do is I'm going to open my Firefox
01:34 - browser and I will click on this button
01:36 - on the right and I will just click this
01:40 - add-ons button and in here I will search
01:43 - for SQLite and it's going to show you
01:46 - all the result and we are interested in
01:49 - this first result which says SQLite
01:52 - manager ok so just click install and
01:56 - it's going to download and install this
01:59 - SQLite manager and it's going to say
02:01 - restart your web browser so I'm going to
02:04 - restart my Firefox web browser and once
02:08 - it's restarted SQLite is added to your
02:12 - Firefox browser
02:13 - now how to search for this SQLite
02:16 - manager so now once again go to this
02:20 - open menu and you can see here
02:22 - SQLite manager is added to your options
02:27 - here okay now if you don't find this
02:30 - SQLite manager here you may need to go
02:33 - to customize and in here you will find
02:37 - this SQLite manager and then you just
02:40 - need to drag and drop this into your
02:44 - open menu so for example this is SQLite
02:47 - manager you can just drag and drop this
02:49 - in here okay and then you will be able
02:52 - to see this SQLite manager okay so once
02:56 - everything is finished you just go to
02:58 - this open menu and open this SQLite
03:01 - manager now for the first time when you
03:03 - open this SQLite manager it's going to
03:06 - look something like this so to create a
03:09 - new SQLite database you can just go to
03:13 - database at the top and you can just say
03:16 - create database or otherwise you can go
03:19 - to this icon and select this icon and
03:22 - it's going to prompt you to create a new
03:24 - database now for example we are going to
03:27 - create a database called employee DB ok
03:32 - and click OK
03:34 - and it's going to ask you to save this
03:36 - database at some specified location so
03:40 - just select some location which you can
03:43 - remember and just say create folder and
03:45 - now your SQLite database will be created
03:49 - so you can see my SQLite database is
03:52 - shown at the top here and when you go to
03:56 - the location where you have saved your
03:58 - database it'll look something like this
04:01 - so my database name with the extension
04:03 - of SQLite now it's not necessary that
04:06 - your school ID database must have this
04:10 - extension SQLite it can have the
04:12 - extension dot DB or some other extension
04:15 - but in the case of SQLite manager it
04:18 - creates the database with this extension
04:20 - which is s collide ok so now we are
04:25 - going to create a table inside
04:27 - this SQLite database should just go to
04:30 - this table category enter your database
04:33 - name and then right click and just click
04:35 - this option which says create table and
04:38 - in here first of all we are going to
04:40 - give the name to our table for example
04:42 - employee okay
04:44 - and in this employee table I'm going to
04:46 - create some columns for example first is
04:50 - ID second is name third is surname
04:54 - fourth is age and we are going to create
04:58 - two extra fields for username and
05:01 - password okay
05:02 - so just write username and the next
05:05 - field is password okay and then give the
05:08 - data type to all of them first ID is an
05:12 - integer type the name is text type
05:15 - surname is text age is integer username
05:20 - is text and password is text okay and in
05:25 - here you can choose your primary key
05:27 - from here so let's say our primary key
05:29 - is ID and in here you can choose if you
05:32 - want your ID to be Auto incremented or
05:36 - not so let's say yes we want that it
05:39 - should increment with every insert and
05:42 - you can choose if you want to allow the
05:45 - null or not and if you want to allow the
05:48 - unique or not so I will leave them as
05:51 - default and I will just say okay and
05:55 - it's going to create this table inside
05:59 - the database just click yes and now you
06:02 - can see employee databases created and
06:05 - you have these columns inside your
06:08 - database right so just select your table
06:11 - and go to browse and search option here
06:14 - and now we are going to insert some
06:16 - values in this table so just click this
06:18 - option which says add and now let's add
06:21 - some values for example the ID name is
06:25 - for example Toms surname is something
06:29 - and age for example 22 and username for
06:34 - now let's say it's test and password is
06:37 - also test for now okay and click
06:41 - ok and click ok and it's going to add
06:43 - this first row inside your table okay so
06:48 - now you have one database and inside
06:50 - your database you have this employee
06:53 - table with one row of data now second
06:56 - step to connect your SQLite database
07:00 - with your Java FX application is to have
07:05 - a SQLite JDBC jar file so just go to
07:10 - your browser once again and search for
07:13 - SQLite JDBC jar ok and search for this
07:19 - and the first option which will appear
07:21 - here will be from bit bucket dot o-r-g
07:25 - slash X serial slash Escalade - JDBC so
07:31 - just select this first option from here
07:33 - and it's going to give you these option
07:37 - and we are interested in the latest
07:40 - release which is at the top so just
07:43 - select this SQLite - JDBC and whatever
07:46 - the latest version is and download this
07:50 - jar file and save it somewhere so I have
07:54 - saved this jar file at the same place as
07:57 - my database so I know that this is the
08:01 - jar file I need to use ok so now we have
08:05 - all the required things to create our
08:08 - JavaFX project using SQLite database so
08:13 - I think that's it for this video in the
08:15 - next video we are going to create our
08:17 - first Java FX project using SQLite
08:21 - database so stay tuned and please rate
08:23 - comment subscribe and bye for now
