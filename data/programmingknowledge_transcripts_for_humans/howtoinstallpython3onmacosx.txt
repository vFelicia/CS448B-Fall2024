00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install Python on your Mac so let's get
00:06 - started open your favorite browser in my
00:09 - case I'm going to open Safari but you
00:12 - can use any other browser you want and
00:15 - search for Python and the first link
00:19 - most probably which will appear here
00:21 - will be from Python or G so just click
00:23 - this link which is python.org G and here
00:27 - you will be able to see this kind of
00:29 - interface now in order to download the
00:33 - Python on your Mac you just need to go
00:35 - to downloads and then this website will
00:40 - automatically recognize that you are on
00:42 - Mac OS so it's going to give you the
00:46 - downloads for your Mac OS now there are
00:48 - two versions so you can see here one is
00:52 - three point six point zero which is the
00:54 - latest version and one is the legacy
00:56 - version which is two point seven point
00:59 - 13 right so what we are going to do is
01:02 - we are going to download the latest
01:05 - version which starts from three point
01:07 - any number if you are watching this
01:10 - video in the future it can be three
01:13 - point seven eight or nine or any version
01:15 - so we are going to download and install
01:18 - this version which is it starts from
01:21 - three ok just click download button here
01:24 - and it's going to start the download and
01:26 - some time your download will be
01:29 - completed so just wait for the download
01:31 - to complete and once the download is
01:33 - complete we are ready to run it so just
01:36 - go to the download section here and then
01:39 - click this option which says python 3.6
01:43 - mac OS dot PKG version right so just
01:47 - double click on this python file which
01:51 - you have downloaded and i'm going to
01:53 - minimize the browser and you can see
01:55 - this kind of installation wizard start
01:58 - ok so you just need to click continue at
02:02 - this step and then you just need to read
02:04 - the license terms and condition and if
02:07 - you agree with those license terms and
02:09 - condition just click continue and in
02:12 - here also once
02:13 - click continue and save you need to
02:16 - agree to the license so just click agree
02:19 - and then in this step you just need to
02:23 - click install and in between you will be
02:27 - asked to give your password so you just
02:29 - need to give your password and then
02:32 - click install software and then the
02:36 - installation of Python will start on
02:39 - your Mac and you just need to wait for
02:41 - some time until this progress bar
02:44 - reaches to the hundred percent mark and
02:47 - once it's completed we will see how we
02:50 - can you know open Python and then how we
02:54 - can use it
02:55 - so now python is installed on our Mac
02:57 - you can see the installation is
02:59 - successful so we are going to close this
03:02 - window and then we are going to see
03:05 - whether it's really installed on our
03:07 - system or not by writing some test code
03:12 - for example hello world code so whenever
03:14 - you install Python it comes with an IDE
03:17 - called
03:18 - idle and to search that idle IDE you can
03:22 - go at the top and just click this search
03:25 - icon here which will open the spotlight
03:28 - search and then search for idle so I'm
03:31 - going to just type ideally for idle and
03:35 - after typing idle you will be able to
03:37 - see this first option which says idle
03:40 - and you will also be able to see this
03:43 - Python icon here right so just click on
03:46 - idle which is going to open your idle
03:50 - IDE and you can see it's opening and now
03:53 - our idle IDE is open so you can see this
03:57 - kind of interface will open whenever
04:00 - idle IDE starts right so it's going to
04:04 - give you the version of Python you have
04:06 - installed and then it's going to give
04:09 - you this kind of warning whenever you
04:11 - start idle for the first time just press
04:15 - ENTER once and you will see this kind of
04:18 - arrow here right so in order to print
04:21 - something you just need to for example
04:24 - use a print method so just write print
04:28 - and then inside paranthesis you can
04:31 - write a string to print it so for
04:34 - example I want to print hello world so
04:37 - I'm going to just write hello world in
04:41 - between codes so just try to print and
04:44 - in parentheses and inside double quotes
04:46 - just the right hello world and then
04:49 - press ENTER and then it's going to print
04:51 - hello world right so very simple and
04:54 - python is installed and working
04:56 - successfully on your Mac computer now if
05:00 - you want to use Python from your Mac OS
05:03 - terminal you can do that also so what
05:05 - I'm going to do is I'm going to minimize
05:07 - this idle IDE so I will open the Mac's
05:11 - terminal now and here first of all you
05:15 - just need to type python in order to
05:17 - start fighting so just type python here
05:21 - and then press Enter which is going to
05:23 - give you the Python terminal and then
05:26 - once you see these three arrows then you
05:30 - can use your Mac terminal as a Python
05:33 - terminal also so you can just write for
05:36 - example print here and the parent is
05:39 - here and in the double quotes you can
05:41 - just write the same code you have
05:43 - written in your idle IDE so I'm going to
05:47 - just print hello world and then I'm
05:51 - going to just press ENTER and it prints
05:54 - hello world so either way you can use
05:57 - Python from your terminal also and you
06:00 - can use Python from this idle IDE which
06:04 - comes with Python installation also so I
06:08 - hope you've enjoyed this video please
