00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - what is class inheritance in Java and
00:09 - how to use class inheritance in Java so
00:13 - classes in Java can be extended and how
00:17 - they can be extended by creating new
00:20 - classes which can retain the character
00:24 - sticks of the base class and base class
00:29 - I mean here is the class from which we
00:32 - are
00:33 - inheriting now to understand it fully I
00:39 - have a little diagram to explain now for
00:45 - example I want to uh make a class which
00:49 - can calculate the area of some
00:53 - shapes so it can be rectangle square
00:59 - circle or triangle or anything right so
01:04 - I can make a class called polygon
01:07 - because they share rectangle and
01:09 - triangle shares a similar property and
01:12 - what is this property they both have
01:16 - width and height right so I can Define
01:21 - two variables in my polygon class and I
01:25 - can set these width and height of these
01:28 - value in this polygon class using a
01:32 - method set value and in this rectangle
01:36 - or and triangle class I can create uh
01:39 - two methods which can calculate the area
01:44 - of triangle and area of rectangle so the
01:48 - common properties which they both share
01:51 - which is height and width we cannot we
01:55 - don't need to Define it in separate
01:59 - places in rect rectangle also and
02:01 - triangle also we can Define them at the
02:04 - single place and we can use them using
02:09 - the inheritance property
02:12 - and how you can know that uh these
02:17 - shapes or whatever classes you are going
02:19 - to make Shares are inheritance property
02:24 - so
02:25 - if the classes you are making have have
02:30 - is a
02:32 - relationship is a means what I mean to
02:36 - say is
02:37 - is our relationship like this so
02:42 - rectangle is a polygon right and
02:44 - triangle is a pro polygon so they share
02:48 - is
02:50 - a property in between them so this uh
02:55 - relationship whenever some class inhab
02:59 - pars from some other class the share is
03:03 - a property or relationship so rectangle
03:06 - is a polygon and triangle is a polygon
03:09 - right so let's go towards the code part
03:13 - of it so what we are going to do is we
03:16 - are going to make three classes so we
03:19 - will go to the package one class first
03:22 - class we are going to make and I will
03:24 - call it
03:26 - as
03:28 - polyon
03:32 - right and I will I'm going to make two
03:37 - more classes one is rectangle and one is
03:41 - triangle
03:42 - so I will say this
03:47 - is
03:48 - rectangle
03:50 - class and I'm going to make one more
03:52 - class which is going to be the triangle
03:58 - class
04:00 - triangle
04:02 - okay now in my polygon class I
04:06 - have what property in
04:09 - common both rectangle and triangle can
04:12 - have width and height so I will Define
04:17 - two variable which will be protected and
04:20 - why they are protected I have shown you
04:23 - and I have uh shown you what is uh the
04:27 - meaning of XIs modifier so
04:33 - protected and then
04:39 - int
04:41 - height and in the same way I will
04:43 - declare one more variable which will
04:46 - also be protected which will
04:49 - be width okay and I will Define a method
04:54 - which will
04:55 - be public and which will return the the
05:00 - area so for example we will
05:03 - return area in
05:07 - double right
05:10 - and so this in here let's try to set the
05:16 - values of uh width and height for
05:19 - rectangle and triangle
05:21 - okay so this will be
05:24 - void
05:28 - set with values and in here we will
05:32 - Define int a comma int B and whatever
05:39 - user will pass the value of
05:43 - a we will just say height is equal
05:48 - to
05:51 - a and width is equal
05:58 - to with is equal to
06:01 - B okay so by this method we are going to
06:05 - set the values okay now in my rectangle
06:10 - class how we can inherit from this
06:13 - polygon class we can inherit from
06:17 - polygon class in my rectangle class by
06:21 - using
06:23 - keyword extends okay just use the
06:27 - keyword extend and then
06:30 - use the class from which you are
06:33 - extending okay so rectangle class is
06:37 - inheriting from your polygon class and
06:42 - polygon class is in here is called
06:46 - derived class and rectangle class here
06:50 - is a class which is deriving right so
06:54 - this can be called Base Class and this
06:56 - can be called the CL class class which
06:59 - is deriving okay in the same way I will
07:03 - extend in the Triangle class
07:07 - also from polygon because polygon is my
07:11 - base class from which I'm inheriting and
07:14 - now in my rectangle class I'm just going
07:19 - to calculate the area now one whenever
07:24 - or if you are inheriting from a base
07:28 - class to a derived class then all its
07:33 - protected members and public members are
07:37 - accessible in your derived class okay so
07:43 - these member height and width and set
07:46 - values are accessed can be accessed by
07:50 - this rectangle class because we are
07:52 - extending from it okay if this was these
07:57 - variables and this methods what private
08:01 - then we cannot uh you know use them in
08:04 - other classes but because they are
08:07 - protected and public protected and
08:09 - public method can be used in sub classes
08:13 - so this is a subass and this is a base
08:16 - class so we can just Define a
08:19 - method
08:21 - public and this will be the area
08:25 - so
08:27 - double A
08:30 - and what this method is going to do it
08:33 - will just
08:34 - return the area
08:37 - so
08:40 - return
08:43 - height
08:44 - [Music]
08:46 - into width and which height and which
08:50 - width we are talking about here because
08:53 - we haven't declared width and height
08:57 - inside this class in this rectangle
09:00 - class right but whenever you hover over
09:03 - and click on this height you will go to
09:08 - the height in polygon class okay so this
09:13 - height in polygon class is accessible in
09:17 - this rectangle class also okay and withd
09:21 - also from polygon class is acceptable in
09:25 - the rectangle class also okay in a
09:28 - similar
09:29 - way the area of the triangle is half so
09:36 - height into width divided by two right
09:41 - so we will just divide it by two
09:45 - okay so we have everything we have the
09:49 - area of triangle we have area of uh
09:53 - rectangle and we are setting these value
09:56 - via this polygon class
09:59 - now what we can do in our main method we
10:03 - can uh use or we can create the instance
10:06 - of rectangle class so rectangle re C for
10:11 - rectangle is equal to
10:13 - new
10:15 - rectangle and we are going to create the
10:19 - instance of our triangle class also so
10:23 - triangle
10:24 - TR TR r i is equal to new
10:31 - triangle and then for calculating the
10:35 - area we first need to set the Valu so we
10:38 - will set the value of uh first rectangle
10:42 - so we will use instance of rectangle
10:44 - class dot set because we are
10:48 - inheriting from the polygon class in
10:52 - rectangle class this set Value method is
10:56 - Al also accessible in in the rectangle
11:00 - Class via its uh instance okay that's
11:04 - why we can access uh set Value method
11:08 - via
11:09 - this rectangle instance for example we
11:13 - have
11:14 - 10 and 10 width and height okay in the
11:20 - same way we can access set Value method
11:24 - from our triangle
11:27 - class and this this for example is also
11:31 - same 10 and 10 with 10 height okay now
11:36 - we just need to call the
11:38 - area so we can just write CIS
11:43 - o and from rectangle class we can call
11:46 - its area method
11:49 - dot
11:51 - area and in the same way we can call the
11:55 - area from the triangle instance which is
12:00 - try and now when we run the
12:05 - program we will get the answer first is
12:09 - the area of rectangle and second is the
12:13 - area of triangle so we can just modify
12:16 - this something like
12:18 - this
12:20 - area
12:24 - of
12:27 - rectangle
12:29 - is equal
12:31 - to plus right in a same way we can write
12:36 - area of
12:40 - triangle is equal to this one okay and
12:44 - area of rectangle and triangle are
12:46 - displayed like the area of rectangle is
12:48 - 100 which is 10 into 10 width into
12:52 - height and area of triangle a is equal
12:55 - to 10 into 10 / 2 is equal 50
13:00 - right so once
13:02 - again whenever we use
13:06 - inheritance all the property of the base
13:09 - class in our case polygon
13:11 - class is available in your derived class
13:16 - in our case these are rectangle and
13:19 - triangle class so all the method which
13:22 - are protected or public are accessible
13:26 - inside our rectangle or triangle class
13:31 - okay so you can use the method inside
13:34 - polygon class if you derive it in
13:39 - rectangle class you can use this height
13:41 - and width we have derived in here
13:46 - using this rectangle class because we
13:49 - are extending from it okay so in this
13:54 - way you can extend the property of
13:56 - polygon class to the rectangle class and
14:00 - same is for triangle class so I hope you
14:04 - have understood the basic concept of
14:07 - inheritance in Java and I hope you have
14:09 - enjoyed this video please WR comment and
14:11 - subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is class inheritance in Java and how to use class inheritance in Java so classes in Java can be extended and how they can be extended by creating new classes which can retain the character sticks of the base class and base class I mean here is the class from which we are inheriting now to understand it fully I have a little diagram to explain now for example I want to uh make a class which can calculate the area of some shapes so it can be rectangle square circle or triangle or anything right so I can make a class called polygon because they share rectangle and triangle shares a similar property and what is this property they both have width and height right so I can Define two variables in my polygon class and I can set these width and height of these value in this polygon class using a method set value and in this rectangle or and triangle class I can create uh two methods which can calculate the area of triangle and area of rectangle so the common properties which they both share which is height and width we cannot we don't need to Define it in separate places in rect rectangle also and triangle also we can Define them at the single place and we can use them using the inheritance property and how you can know that uh these shapes or whatever classes you are going to make Shares are inheritance property so if the classes you are making have have is a relationship is a means what I mean to say is is our relationship like this so rectangle is a polygon right and triangle is a pro polygon so they share is a property in between them so this uh relationship whenever some class inhab pars from some other class the share is a property or relationship so rectangle is a polygon and triangle is a polygon right so let's go towards the code part of it so what we are going to do is we are going to make three classes so we will go to the package one class first class we are going to make and I will call it as polyon right and I will I'm going to make two more classes one is rectangle and one is triangle so I will say this is rectangle class and I'm going to make one more class which is going to be the triangle class triangle okay now in my polygon class I have what property in common both rectangle and triangle can have width and height so I will Define two variable which will be protected and why they are protected I have shown you and I have uh shown you what is uh the meaning of XIs modifier so protected and then int height and in the same way I will declare one more variable which will also be protected which will be width okay and I will Define a method which will be public and which will return the the area so for example we will return area in double right and so this in here let's try to set the values of uh width and height for rectangle and triangle okay so this will be void set with values and in here we will Define int a comma int B and whatever user will pass the value of a we will just say height is equal to a and width is equal to with is equal to B okay so by this method we are going to set the values okay now in my rectangle class how we can inherit from this polygon class we can inherit from polygon class in my rectangle class by using keyword extends okay just use the keyword extend and then use the class from which you are extending okay so rectangle class is inheriting from your polygon class and polygon class is in here is called derived class and rectangle class here is a class which is deriving right so this can be called Base Class and this can be called the CL class class which is deriving okay in the same way I will extend in the Triangle class also from polygon because polygon is my base class from which I'm inheriting and now in my rectangle class I'm just going to calculate the area now one whenever or if you are inheriting from a base class to a derived class then all its protected members and public members are accessible in your derived class okay so these member height and width and set values are accessed can be accessed by this rectangle class because we are extending from it okay if this was these variables and this methods what private then we cannot uh you know use them in other classes but because they are protected and public protected and public method can be used in sub classes so this is a subass and this is a base class so we can just Define a method public and this will be the area so double A and what this method is going to do it will just return the area so return height into width and which height and which width we are talking about here because we haven't declared width and height inside this class in this rectangle class right but whenever you hover over and click on this height you will go to the height in polygon class okay so this height in polygon class is accessible in this rectangle class also okay and withd also from polygon class is acceptable in the rectangle class also okay in a similar way the area of the triangle is half so height into width divided by two right so we will just divide it by two okay so we have everything we have the area of triangle we have area of uh rectangle and we are setting these value via this polygon class now what we can do in our main method we can uh use or we can create the instance of rectangle class so rectangle re C for rectangle is equal to new rectangle and we are going to create the instance of our triangle class also so triangle TR TR r i is equal to new triangle and then for calculating the area we first need to set the Valu so we will set the value of uh first rectangle so we will use instance of rectangle class dot set because we are inheriting from the polygon class in rectangle class this set Value method is Al also accessible in in the rectangle Class via its uh instance okay that's why we can access uh set Value method via this rectangle instance for example we have 10 and 10 width and height okay in the same way we can access set Value method from our triangle class and this this for example is also same 10 and 10 with 10 height okay now we just need to call the area so we can just write CIS o and from rectangle class we can call its area method dot area and in the same way we can call the area from the triangle instance which is try and now when we run the program we will get the answer first is the area of rectangle and second is the area of triangle so we can just modify this something like this area of rectangle is equal to plus right in a same way we can write area of triangle is equal to this one okay and area of rectangle and triangle are displayed like the area of rectangle is 100 which is 10 into 10 width into height and area of triangle a is equal to 10 into 10 / 2 is equal 50 right so once again whenever we use inheritance all the property of the base class in our case polygon class is available in your derived class in our case these are rectangle and triangle class so all the method which are protected or public are accessible inside our rectangle or triangle class okay so you can use the method inside polygon class if you derive it in rectangle class you can use this height and width we have derived in here using this rectangle class because we are extending from it okay so in this way you can extend the property of polygon class to the rectangle class and same is for triangle class so I hope you have understood the basic concept of inheritance in Java and I hope you have enjoyed this video
