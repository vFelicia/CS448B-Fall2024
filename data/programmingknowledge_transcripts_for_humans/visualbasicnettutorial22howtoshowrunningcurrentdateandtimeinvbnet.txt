With timestamps:

00:00 - hello guys in the last video I've shown
00:03 - you how to use timers with your Visual
00:05 - Basic Windows Form application in this
00:08 - video I will show you how to show
00:10 - running current date and time with your
00:14 - Visual Basic Windows Form application
00:17 - using the timers so let's get started
00:20 - first of all I will take a label from my
00:24 - toolbox and I will yeah I just need a
00:28 - label and let me change the font size of
00:33 - these this
00:36 - label and let's make it little bit
00:40 - bigger okay so I have a label and I will
00:44 - change the
00:46 - text
00:48 - as
00:50 - date time it doesn't matter what is the
00:53 - text on it because we are going to
00:55 - change this text
00:58 - okay
01:00 - so now we have the
01:03 - label and we will take a timer from our
01:06 - toolbox and drag and drop into the form
01:09 - and it will go here and now what we are
01:12 - going to do is we will just select
01:16 - our our form as a whole and double click
01:20 - it and that leads us to the form load
01:24 - event okay and in here we will
01:28 - write
01:32 - timer timer one which is the name of our
01:36 - timer
01:38 - dot
01:44 - enable is equal
01:46 - to
01:49 - True okay so when our for form loads we
01:53 - want to be uh this we want that our
01:57 - timer should be enabled right
02:00 - right and now what I'm going to do is
02:04 - I'm going to select this timer and
02:07 - double click it and in here in this
02:10 - timer pick
02:12 - event I will write the name of my label
02:15 - which is label
02:18 - one
02:20 - dot
02:22 - text is equal
02:25 - to
02:27 - date Dot
02:32 - now
02:34 - dot two
02:39 - string okay and in this
02:43 - string parenthesis we are going to pass
02:47 - some argument to show the date and time
02:51 - so here we will pass the format of date
02:54 - and time we
02:56 - want so this can be decided by you for
02:59 - example I I want to show the date as day
03:05 - dash the month of the year so mm Capital
03:10 - mm for month Dash year so year for
03:15 - showing here you you can show it in two
03:19 - digit or four digigit I'm going to show
03:21 - it in four digigit and now for the real
03:25 - time I must give the hours so HH for
03:31 - hours and double colon minute small M
03:35 - for minutes so small double m and then
03:39 - the second so small dou s for the
03:43 - seconds
03:44 - now you can also change the interval of
03:47 - time to the tick of the time so select
03:50 - your timer and make it 1,000 millisecond
03:55 - which is 1 second and now when I run the
03:58 - program
04:00 - you see
04:03 - my timer is sticking and it's showing
04:06 - the current date and current time which
04:10 - is running time and you can also change
04:14 - the format of this date and time
04:18 - according to your custom string for
04:21 - example I want to show the
04:24 - month in three values for example so
04:28 - just write month and here I instead of
04:33 - this Dash I don't want to show I I want
04:37 - to show spaces right so now when I run
04:40 - the
04:42 - program it
04:44 - shows a little different date date is
04:49 - same but the format is Chang right so we
04:52 - can customize
04:54 - our time and date format according to
04:57 - ourself just remember the day takes DD m
05:02 - month takes capital m m year takes small
05:07 - y hour
05:10 - takes Double H smaller minutes takes
05:14 - smaller m m and second St smaller s s
05:19 - right so now you have running digital
05:23 - clock with your Visual Basic Windows
05:26 - Form application I hope you have enjoyed
