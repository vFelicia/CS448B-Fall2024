03:35 - 8 which is this one so I'm going to
03:37 - choose this desktop device and once I

04:33 - so once again I'm going to just press on
04:37 - this desktop pH s e six five eight which
04:41 - is my desktop and I will just say always
04:45 - once and then once again I will allow

05:02 - show you a few things which might help
05:04 - you to mirror your android screen on
05:07 - your Windows operating system
05:08 - the first is you just need to search for
05:12 - firewall and you will see this result
05:15 - which is firewall and network protection
05:17 - here so in some cases the firewall is on
05:22 - which is the recommended setting also
05:25 - but if you face some problems then you
05:29 - might be able to solve this problem by
05:32 - just disabling this for the private
05:36 - network or the public network so when I
05:38 - do disable here and when the private
05:42 - network and public network is disabled
05:44 - just try again and most probably the
05:47 - problem will be solved okay so one
05:50 - solution can be this one just disable
05:53 - your private network and public network
05:55 - firewall and try again and if it solves
05:58 - your problem then very good I have one
06:01 - other solution for you if you don't see
06:04 - your android screen on your Windows 10
06:06 - then just right-click on your windows
06:10 - icon here and then click on device
06:13 - manager and then you might want to
06:15 - update your intel UHD graphics here okay
06:20 - so just right-click and then update
06:22 - driver this might also help in solving
06:25 - this problem when you face this problem
06:28 - so these are some troubleshooting steps
06:31 - you can use
06:33 - if your android screen is not visible on
