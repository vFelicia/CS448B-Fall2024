01:46 - to do say list all too loose okay
01:57 - so you can give any title you want list
02:00 - too tall to lose okay so basically what
02:03 - you can do so we'll move use bootstrap
02:06 - here so we'll move to this URL so the
02:10 - this would give us the components here
02:13 - so here you can see so we'll quickly
02:17 - move to the URL and we can do what we
02:20 - can use either we can use card okay we
02:23 - can use card here okay
02:26 - so this was good so so I'll copy this
02:30 - okay but before that what we need to do
02:33 - okay we use this was our form which hold
02:37 - fine so it will move to the views toward
02:39 - py file
02:40 - okay till here we it's fine so and do a
02:43 - digital my dictionary I care to my
02:45 - dictionary Noah dictionary and for all
02:54 - to loose okay I render them to the page
02:59 - to do dot objects dot all so I hope this
03:07 - is fine so so to do dot object at all
03:11 - and I'll do list dot HTML and I'll give
03:16 - end text is equal to my dictionary
03:22 - I hope this fine okay so let me add a
03:25 - new to do and check new data new data
03:34 - new and I'll give a priority as six and
03:37 - and submit this so yes yes but okay let
03:47 - me to check one thing okay okay I made a
03:51 - mistake okay
03:52 - I had in this my index dot HTML I had to
03:57 - put this all under the block content
04:00 - block content okay
04:06 - and here's the phone and I'll end this
04:11 - with percent and block this is fine I
04:19 - hope this design person and block will
04:21 - do okay now and here what can I do in
04:27 - this page the list dot HTML which name I
04:33 - had made that is all to lose so I'll do
04:36 - like this all too loose okay so I hope
04:43 - this hood was fine now so to do titleist
04:45 - new title three new okay let me give it
04:51 - a seven okay so here you can see I have
04:56 - it is showing me query set which says to
05:00 - do object four five six and let me check
05:03 - in my data which are this four five six
05:05 - so these are the three which I had which
05:08 - I had recently added these are the three
05:10 - okay so we would have use a list for
05:13 - card so so what you can do we can use
05:17 - the for loop here percent for each to do
05:22 - it for to do for each for each to do in
05:30 - all two rules okay I hope this fine okay
05:37 - that's all to lose this is percent and
05:41 - forth okay so so this is fine this is
05:49 - car title so I'll give each to do dot
05:56 - title
06:00 - I'm in the same way I'll give each two
06:07 - to do dot description okay
06:10 - each to do dot description so this would
06:16 - give me the description okay and one
06:22 - thing I can do
06:23 - also let me check okay what I can do I
06:34 - will give a space here and type each to
06:37 - do dot priority I hope this is fine this
06:44 - is this would give the priority and will
06:48 - come to this reference tang will create
06:50 - delete operation here so I will refresh
06:52 - this page so here you can see new title
06:55 - new description new data six didn't you
06:58 - new title three seven new new tactic
07:00 - three says okay so so i maybe i refresh
07:05 - this page so i had an effect this query
07:08 - twice so that's why i have to twice this
07:10 - data okay because I had refresh this
07:12 - page so this had made another operation
07:15 - hired operation here okay so will now do
07:17 - something width is this margin
07:22 - I'll give a margin top of one Ram okay
07:28 - and their last is equal to row okay div
07:38 - class is equal to call em d6 so I hope
07:45 - this is fine now I'll paste the card
07:46 - here so here you can see here a
07:49 - file-based card now and here you can see
07:56 - okay let me do this okay yeah and I'll
08:02 - give it style is equal to margin I'll
08:07 - give a margin a margin:0 auto okay so
08:14 - I'll again a refresh this page so I'll
08:17 - so yeah now H looks fine okay but let me
08:23 - check something so so this is called md6
08:30 - yeah so here what you can do if you want
08:35 - to increase the width you can give
08:37 - anything you want maybe what you can do
08:45 - I keep class of the card and contain it
08:50 - fluid so this would take the whole width
08:57 - of the container okay so I hope this is
09:00 - fine enough okay so and now we have to
09:03 - create the delete operation so so click
09:09 - till now let me do one thing so I've had
09:12 - a new title new title delete operation
09:20 - okay delete task something like this
09:25 - varieties I will give it as 78 when I
09:29 - add this I get this at the end okay
09:32 - so one thing we are missing here that is
09:35 - the we had made model short py we had
09:38 - created an operation so we'll even add
09:40 - this also so so I'll copy this and now
09:48 - I'll do each to do created act okay so
09:56 - so I'll refresh this page now here you
10:01 - can see I have all the created options
10:04 - with the timings okay
