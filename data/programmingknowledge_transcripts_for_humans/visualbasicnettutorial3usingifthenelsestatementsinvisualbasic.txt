00:00 - hello guys welcome to the third video
00:02 - tutorial on Visual Basic in this video I
00:05 - will show you how to use if statement in
00:09 - your Visual Basic and I will also show
00:13 - you how to use text boxes and labels
00:16 - with your Visual
00:19 - Basic Windows Form application project
00:23 - so let's get started uh first of all I
00:25 - will take a label from here and second
00:30 - thing I will take a text box from my
00:33 - toolbox so this is the text box and I
00:37 - will take a button from the toolbox so
00:40 - this is a button okay and I will change
00:45 - the text of this button
00:49 - as
00:51 - check
00:54 - if statement okay so it this button is
00:59 - is going to check if
01:02 - statement and this text box name is just
01:06 - select this text box and you will be
01:08 - able to see this text box name is
01:10 - textbox one so remember this and the
01:13 - name of the label is label one you see
01:17 - here name of the label is label one so
01:19 - you need to remember these two things so
01:24 - just select your button and double click
01:26 - it once again check if statement and and
01:30 - in here we are going to write our if
01:33 - statement so we
01:36 - write
01:39 - if which is this
01:42 - if and then we write the name of the
01:46 - text box so
01:47 - write text box
01:52 - one and Dot text because we are going to
01:57 - take the text from the text box
02:00 - so take the text if your textbox text is
02:05 - equal to and let's give a condition so
02:10 - you will give that if my textbox text is
02:14 - equal
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - to one for example then what you will do
02:22 - is
02:25 - then and it automatically ends the if
02:29 - condition and it the visual studio adds
02:33 - the code for ending the if condition so
02:35 - whenever you initialize if condition you
02:38 - need to give this end if to end the
02:41 - condition and inside this if condition
02:43 - we are going
02:45 - to perform our code if this condition is
02:48 - true so I will
02:51 - write label one which is the name of my
02:56 - label
02:58 - dot text
03:00 - next is equal to and I will say on the
03:04 - label one I want to show the
03:06 - message message one okay and for I will
03:12 - just copy the same code and I will just
03:16 - go down below this end if condition and
03:20 - I will paste it once again and now I
03:23 - will say if my message textbox do text
03:28 - is equal to 2 then I will say this
03:31 - message is message two in the same way I
03:35 - can just add one
03:37 - more line of condition
03:41 - message three for three so now I will
03:44 - check what uh is the condition in the
03:47 - text box and according to it you will be
03:50 - able to see the message but before that
03:54 - let's uh CH change the font of uh this
04:01 - text box so that you can see it and the
04:05 - label
04:08 - font 16 Bold and the button fault font
04:14 - sorry which is 16 okay now you will be
04:18 - able to see all these things when I run
04:22 - the program and when I say one I'm
04:26 - giving the condition in the textbox one
04:29 - and and when I click this check if
04:32 - statement I see message one when I enter
04:36 - the condition two I see message two and
04:40 - when I enter the condition three I see
04:44 - the message 3 so in this way you can use
04:49 - if conditions with your Visual Basic
04:53 - Windows Form application I hope you have
04:55 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
