00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to install Java jdk in your Ubuntu
00:07 - Linux operating system so let's see
00:11 - which is the latest version of jdk so
00:15 - open your browser and write in the
00:18 - search Java jdk and the first link which
00:22 - comes is this from
00:25 - Oracle Java SE download and I will click
00:28 - it
00:32 - and at the time of uh making this video
00:36 - Let's see which is the version of uh
00:39 - Java jdk so Java jdk7 is the latest
00:46 - version so we are going to install Java
00:49 - jdk7 in our open to operating system so
00:53 - I will just minimize my browser and I
00:55 - will open my
00:57 - terminal and I will
01:01 - write this command sud sudo
01:05 - apt-get install open jdk dash the
01:10 - version you are installing so we are
01:12 - installing version 7 so we write here
01:15 - 7- jdk okay so just give this command
01:20 - and press enter and give your
01:27 - password and here
01:31 - I have already installed this open jdk7
01:35 - in my operating system so it's saying
01:40 - that Java jdk7 is already in the newest
01:45 - version but when you install this uh
01:49 - Java jdk in your system for the first
01:51 - time it will ask you that uh it it will
01:55 - download this much amount of uh data and
01:59 - uh you just need to type Y which
02:04 - is like allowing uh the data to be
02:08 - stored in your system and then it will
02:10 - be installed in
02:12 - your open 2 operating system now once
02:16 - you have installed just open jdk in your
02:21 - system which is uh version 7 you can uh
02:26 - check whether it's really installed in
02:30 - your system or Not by giving this
02:32 - command write Java and
02:37 - dash version and press
02:43 - enter and you can see here I have Java
02:47 - version
02:49 - 1.7.0 in my system and here open jdk
02:53 - runtime environment is also there in my
02:56 - system and open jdk client
03:00 - also there in my system so generally
03:04 - when you install this jdk in your
03:09 - system you can find it uh in the
03:14 - directory which I am going to show you
03:17 - so here go to the root directories so
03:23 - this is your folder system and here when
03:27 - I click here at the corner we go to the
03:32 - root directories and here in here go to
03:36 - user and then go to
03:39 - lib and here all the libraries are
03:42 - installed
03:44 - so we search for
03:48 - the
03:50 - jvm so here is
03:52 - jvm and you can see here I have Java 7
03:57 - open J jdk here here already installed
04:01 - right so now you can verify this that if
04:07 - this is present in this uh directory
04:10 - then it's installed in your system and
04:13 - when you go further inside it has bin
04:16 - folder so this path we are going to
04:19 - provide it in our export or in our bash
04:25 - file which I'm going to uh show you now
04:28 - so once you have installed
04:31 - jdk we will do some post installation
04:35 - setups so once again open your
04:40 - folder and I will open my home folder
04:44 - from
04:45 - here and in here right now you can see
04:48 - only the visible directories so what we
04:51 - need to do is we need to open all
04:54 - invisible directories so what I will do
04:57 - is just hover over this this line strip
05:02 - or tool strip and you can see it here
05:05 - View and when you click it and just
05:10 - click show hidden
05:13 - files and now you can see all the hidden
05:16 - files here so what we need to do is we
05:19 - need to uh search for this dot
05:22 - bashrc file and just right click it and
05:27 - open with text editor
05:31 - okay and it will open the bash file with
05:35 - your text
05:37 - editor and here we need to do
05:41 - some Java home settings or we need to
05:45 - provide the system path for the Java
05:47 - home so go at the bottom of your file
05:51 - just at the bottom and make some space
05:54 - here and we need to provide here the
05:57 - path to the
06:00 - jvm Java jdk files
06:04 - okay so just type here at the
06:08 - bottom this
06:11 - line export Java home is equal
06:15 - to your jvm part so which which is I
06:19 - have already shown you where is it in
06:22 - your
06:23 - user lib
06:27 - lib and here it will
06:32 - open this here so this is your jdk path
06:38 - so here you will uh
06:44 - just right click and go to the
06:46 - properties and we will provide the path
06:51 - here so just copy this user SL li/
06:57 - jvm and paste it here and also you need
07:03 - to go one file down so just copy this
07:08 - also so this is the name of this folder
07:11 - okay and give a slash once again and
07:14 - paste it here
07:17 - okay so this is your Java home
07:21 - environment and one more thing you need
07:24 - to type here just below this Java home
07:27 - export is this line so write export path
07:31 - is equal to Dollar path and this colon
07:37 - and once again copy the same path from
07:41 - here you can copy the same path from
07:43 - here and paste it
07:45 - here and we will go one file down and
07:49 - put a slasher and we are going to give
07:53 - this bin folder path so here all the
07:57 - Java execute mutable files are there so
08:01 - we will write here bin okay so just add
08:07 - these two lines in your dot
08:10 - bashrc libraries or bash RC file and
08:15 - just save save your
08:18 - file
08:21 - and you can go to the terminal and just
08:26 - type here Java C and and press
08:30 - enter and if it gives you the response
08:35 - that means your jdk is correctly
08:38 - installed in your system so I hope you
