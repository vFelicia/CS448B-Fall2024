00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:06 - how we can use mkdir command in Linux we
00:11 - can use mkdir command to create
00:14 - directories in Linux so let's see how we
00:18 - can do it so first of all just press
00:20 - ctrl alt T to open your terminal and for
00:25 - example I want to just change the
00:28 - directory to my desktop folder so I will
00:31 - just write desktop and press ENTER and
00:34 - in the desktop I want to create a
00:37 - directory called image so I can just
00:40 - give mkdir command which is the command
00:44 - to create any directory and then the
00:47 - name of the directory for example image
00:49 - okay and I will press ENTER and then
00:53 - it's going to create this directory
00:55 - called image now for example I want to
00:58 - create a subdirectory inside this image
01:00 - directory I can just write mkdir once
01:04 - again and the directory name which
01:06 - already exists and then I will give the
01:12 - forward slash for the subdirectory for
01:15 - example I want to create a subdirectory
01:18 - called pics and I will press ENTER and
01:22 - then when I open this image directory it
01:25 - has this pics
01:27 - you know directory right now for example
01:30 - you want to create the subdirectory from
01:35 - the command or for the directory which
01:39 - don't really exist so for example I want
01:43 - to give this command for example MK dir
01:47 - on the desktop and then I want to create
01:51 - a directory called names and then I will
01:55 - give a name for example mark here okay
01:58 - so this directory names doesn't exist on
02:02 - my desktop you can see here right so
02:04 - when I give this command it will give me
02:08 - the error and the error says cannot
02:10 - create directory names so
02:13 - - mark no such file or directory because
02:16 - this names directory doesn't exist which
02:20 - is a parent directory it cannot create
02:23 - this mark subdirectory inside the names
02:28 - so in order to create the directory
02:32 - structure you need to use this flag to
02:37 - your mkdir command which is minus P okay
02:42 - and this flag you can use to you know
02:48 - create a directory structure okay so
02:52 - this flag can be given in two ways this
02:56 - is the short version of giving this flag
03:01 - and if you want to know the full version
03:04 - you can just give to - and then you can
03:09 - just give parents command here okay so
03:13 - the flag name is parents okay and if you
03:18 - give this command it's going to create a
03:21 - directory for you also and sub directory
03:24 - for you which doesn't even exist
03:26 - okay so I'm going to just give this
03:29 - short flag which is a minus P or - P and
03:34 - I will just press ENTER here and it's
03:37 - going to create this directory and it
03:39 - doesn't give me error and when I go
03:41 - inside this directory there is one more
03:43 - directory called mark here right so if
03:48 - you want to create directory or sub
03:50 - directory which doesn't really exist you
03:53 - can use - p f-- language with your mkdir
03:57 - command now for example you want to make
04:01 - or create several direct trees inside
04:05 - your parent directory so what you can do
04:09 - so you can just write mkdir command just
04:13 - right MK dir and then minus P and for
04:18 - example I want to create some directory
04:20 - with some names inside this names
04:23 - directory so I will just give the name
04:25 - of the names directory and then I will
04:29 - just give these curly brackets and
04:32 - inside the curly brackets I can provide
04:35 - the list of directory which I want to
04:37 - create for example I want to create a
04:40 - directory called John I want to create a
04:44 - directory called Tom for example and I
04:48 - want to create a directory called Bob so
04:51 - I want to create three directories
04:53 - inside this names directory so let me
04:57 - open this directory which is names and
05:00 - right now it has only one directory
05:04 - which we have already created so let me
05:06 - press ENTER and let's see what happens
05:08 - and when I press ENTER it creates some
05:12 - directory with this curly brace start
05:15 - and then the first name and then comma
05:18 - so this way you can create but you don't
05:23 - have to give the space between these
05:26 - commas so just remove the space between
05:29 - the commas and press ENTER once again
05:31 - and this time it will create these three
05:35 - directory so always remember when you
05:37 - give a space it will not create the you
05:41 - know correct directory structure you
05:44 - want so you need to give the comma
05:47 - without the space so this format of
05:51 - creating the multiple directory is
05:54 - correct without spaces and this will
05:57 - give you errors as we have seen it has
06:00 - created this directory which we did not
06:03 - want it ok so in this way you can use
06:07 - mkdir command in Linux I hope you've

hey guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how we can use mkdir command in Linux we can use mkdir command to create directories in Linux so let's see how we can do it so first of all just press ctrl alt T to open your terminal and for example I want to just change the directory to my desktop folder so I will just write desktop and press ENTER and in the desktop I want to create a directory called image so I can just give mkdir command which is the command to create any directory and then the name of the directory for example image okay and I will press ENTER and then it's going to create this directory called image now for example I want to create a subdirectory inside this image directory I can just write mkdir once again and the directory name which already exists and then I will give the forward slash for the subdirectory for example I want to create a subdirectory called pics and I will press ENTER and then when I open this image directory it has this pics you know directory right now for example you want to create the subdirectory from the command or for the directory which don't really exist so for example I want to give this command for example MK dir on the desktop and then I want to create a directory called names and then I will give a name for example mark here okay so this directory names doesn't exist on my desktop you can see here right so when I give this command it will give me the error and the error says cannot create directory names so mark no such file or directory because this names directory doesn't exist which is a parent directory it cannot create this mark subdirectory inside the names so in order to create the directory structure you need to use this flag to your mkdir command which is minus P okay and this flag you can use to you know create a directory structure okay so this flag can be given in two ways this is the short version of giving this flag and if you want to know the full version you can just give to and then you can just give parents command here okay so the flag name is parents okay and if you give this command it's going to create a directory for you also and sub directory for you which doesn't even exist okay so I'm going to just give this short flag which is a minus P or P and I will just press ENTER here and it's going to create this directory and it doesn't give me error and when I go inside this directory there is one more directory called mark here right so if you want to create directory or sub directory which doesn't really exist you can use p f language with your mkdir command now for example you want to make or create several direct trees inside your parent directory so what you can do so you can just write mkdir command just right MK dir and then minus P and for example I want to create some directory with some names inside this names directory so I will just give the name of the names directory and then I will just give these curly brackets and inside the curly brackets I can provide the list of directory which I want to create for example I want to create a directory called John I want to create a directory called Tom for example and I want to create a directory called Bob so I want to create three directories inside this names directory so let me open this directory which is names and right now it has only one directory which we have already created so let me press ENTER and let's see what happens and when I press ENTER it creates some directory with this curly brace start and then the first name and then comma so this way you can create but you don't have to give the space between these commas so just remove the space between the commas and press ENTER once again and this time it will create these three directory so always remember when you give a space it will not create the you know correct directory structure you want so you need to give the comma without the space so this format of creating the multiple directory is correct without spaces and this will give you errors as we have seen it has created this directory which we did not want it ok so in this way you can use mkdir command in Linux I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate and subscribe and bye for now
