00:00 - hey all welcome to programming knowledge
00:02 - this is a second tutorial of pi PI QT
00:04 - which we'll be looking at set up and the
00:06 - initial steps of doing the program which
00:09 - is the process of doing a program so let
00:12 - us know start off with what we have seen
00:15 - in that last tutorial we have seen what
00:17 - is pi QT and what are the things
00:19 - available in piety like a hoe over how
00:22 - we are going to use that pi QT libraries
00:24 - in order to make sure that you create a
00:27 - good graphical applications along with
00:29 - the support of packet systems and
00:31 - graphical controls so let's now go ahead
00:33 - and set up the pyqt by following the
00:38 - three steps the first step we are going
00:40 - to do is like we'll go to this mention
00:43 - website which is HTTP colon double slash
00:46 - p bi bi dot o-r-g slash project slash
00:49 - pyqt of five so we are going to type
00:52 - this address in the like google chrome
00:55 - and then after the website opens like
00:59 - we'll be having a installation tab in
01:01 - that we will find the command called pip
01:03 - install of py QT 5 so we are going to
01:07 - use this command in anaconda command
01:11 - line or Python command prompt line like
01:15 - we are going to use this command to
01:18 - install the pyqt library which will
01:20 - enable us to create the programs for
01:22 - creating graphical applications so let's
01:26 - now go ahead and like set up the pyqt
01:29 - we're following the steps as I have
01:34 - already opened the web page as you can
01:38 - see so here there are so many tabs
01:41 - available you can see the project
01:42 - description then you have autolysis
01:44 - documentation documentation if you want
01:47 - any documentation of the pyqt you can
01:49 - just download it from by clicking here
01:51 - over here then as I say it another
01:55 - installations tab we have py p IP
01:57 - install of py q 2 5 so we are going to
02:01 - copy this and let's is for the pyqt
02:10 - library
02:13 - so it's it's going to take some time as
02:15 - we are downloading like we are going to
02:20 - install the pyqt right so it's
02:21 - downloading from the website and it's
02:23 - getting installed so it will take a
02:25 - little bit of time so we are going to
02:27 - wait for these two hour to get installed
02:31 - after that like we'll start creating the
02:34 - first program so here we go we have
02:45 - plugins for the PI QT 5 library file and
02:51 - no let's go and look at the sample code
02:56 - for getting a sample application with an
02:59 - example so we know what they are going
03:07 - to do we are going to discuss a sim for
03:09 - creating a simple GUI application that
03:12 - is the steps so therefore there five
03:15 - steps involved including a simple GUI
03:17 - application so I am going to create a
03:20 - simple GUI application in which we are
03:24 - going to display a window along with a
03:26 - header called pyqt phi simple window in
03:29 - which will be having minimize maximize
03:31 - and close option button because of shunt
03:36 - app now let's go ahead and check out
03:39 - like will start discuss about the code
03:41 - that we are going to use on creating
03:44 - that application so these are the five
03:47 - steps we are going to use for creating
03:48 - that simpler first we'll import pyqt
03:52 - module in which will be having certain
03:55 - things that needs to be imported for
03:56 - creating the application followed by
03:59 - will be defining a method in this method
04:01 - will define the size like top down right
04:05 - left all the subs will be defined over
04:07 - this method and that said we have what
04:09 - we are going to raise we are going to
04:11 - define a separate method for the title
04:13 - which is going to dispute is going to be
04:15 - displayed on top of the screen next we
04:19 - are going to display the application by
04:21 - using the show method which is a work
04:25 - called show we use the
04:26 - to application lastly we are going to
04:29 - create the main method to run the
04:31 - application these are the five steps
04:33 - required to create that simple G
04:36 - application now let's go ahead and
04:39 - discuss one by one what are the stuffs
04:42 - that are going to be defined inside this
04:44 - first we will discuss about the import
04:46 - by by pyqt module let's go give go ahead
04:50 - and check out that so here we go this is
04:56 - the first step we are going to do like
04:58 - we are going to import pyqt module
05:00 - inside this we inside this we are going
05:03 - to define three things first we'll
05:06 - import the SIS which is a system
05:09 - followed by we are going to import q
05:11 - application and Q which yield from pyqt
05:15 - Phi dot Qt widgets it will be used
05:19 - lastly we are going to import q icon
05:22 - which is available in like from pyqt phi
05:26 - dot g QT g i which comes with a camp
05:29 - called its interface so these are the
05:31 - three things you are going to if I on
05:33 - under I am want be like UT model let's
05:36 - go ahead and see what is the second step
05:38 - I can save as I have told you earlier is
05:40 - defining a method so here in this method
05:44 - what we are going to do we are going to
05:46 - set the title pyqt file simple window
05:49 - and along with that you are going to you
05:52 - find the left top width height and
05:56 - lastly initializing the UI which is in
06:00 - it you are by using the self keyword so
06:03 - here we go like as though as we follow
06:06 - the common rule which is first looking
06:08 - at the class so I have defined the class
06:11 - as and class name as app and inside the
06:15 - paranthesis am called on the Q widget
06:17 - which have imported from pyqt Phi dot QT
06:21 - widgets then then I have defined the
06:24 - like the method has been defined as
06:26 - initialized by using this d EF
06:29 - underscore disclose initialize which is
06:32 - INAT and inside that self commit No
06:36 - and super method has been used followed
06:40 - by Titan left of width height and lastly
06:43 - initializing UI so we are going to do
06:45 - like by the code for these things in
06:48 - defining a method so what is it that
06:51 - thing you are going to do you are going
06:53 - to define a method for tighter let's go
06:55 - and check out the define a method for
06:58 - tighter so inside this I am going to use
07:03 - initially the method as a nit UI and
07:07 - inside the parentheses I have used the
07:10 - keyword as self so by using the self
07:13 - keyword what I am going to do self door
07:16 - set window title as self not title which
07:20 - is the title will be taken which is self
07:24 - dot title as pyqt five simple window
07:26 - that will be displayed inside the window
07:30 - title followed by what I'm going to do I
07:33 - am going to use self dot set geometry
07:35 - and he said the parentheses I am going
07:37 - to call self dot left Tom third or big
07:41 - answer broad height which is 10 10 640
07:44 - and 480 so these are the things here I
07:47 - am going to define s at the drama tree
07:50 - and lastly I am going to use the the
07:53 - last method which is the fourth method
07:57 - which I have defined as displaying
07:59 - application you can show method so I
08:01 - have used the show method as served or
08:03 - show to like its application and lastly
08:09 - we are going to use the main method to
08:11 - run the application let's go ahead and
08:13 - check out the main method so I have
08:16 - created the main method by defining if
08:18 - underscore disco name underscore
08:20 - underscore equals equals to main and
08:23 - inside that I have used the object
08:25 - called I a PP AB equals to I've used the
08:28 - Q application which we have used in
08:33 - import pyqt module which you have taken
08:35 - from py codified on creating widgets so
08:39 - what will happen I have used the Q
08:42 - application inside that system that sees
08:45 - door argv
08:46 - which have you which I am going to pass
08:49 - on and last
08:50 - didn't people called e.x inside that I'm
08:54 - going to use the a PP like method which
08:59 - is a profit and lastly I'm going to exit
09:04 - the program by using a PP dot execute
09:08 - underscore followed by the packets so
09:12 - here we go
09:13 - no like what will happen of running this
09:18 - program a simple pyqt fire like the
09:23 - window will be opened along with the
09:25 - icons of clothes minimize and maximize
09:28 - with the header which is py q defy
09:30 - simple window which we have defined so
09:34 - this is the overall code for getting the
09:37 - output as expected of output as P by Q
09:41 - define simple window as you can see
09:43 - first be imported then we created the
09:45 - class then we define the method inside
09:48 - that we have defined the title left of
09:50 - width height and lastly like
09:53 - initializing you are i an ID UI then
09:57 - followed by for window title we have
10:00 - defined the method as in init UI and
10:03 - inside that we have used the self
10:04 - keyword and I said the window title and
10:07 - taken the self dot title which we have
10:09 - defined pyqt pi simple window inside the
10:12 - parentheses on set window title then we
10:15 - use the geometry and called on the self
10:17 - dot left and self dot table set dot B
10:20 - ten self not height it is 1010 640 and
10:22 - 480 and lastly we have used the show
10:25 - with her to like display the application
10:29 - and inside the main method we are going
10:30 - to run the application by using the
10:32 - queue application and inside the
10:35 - parentheses as following by save dot
10:37 - argument which you see RGB and you did a
10:40 - sample like like a variable called
10:42 - EXN centered Eastwood AB and lastly in
10:47 - the system exiting the system so here we
10:51 - go after running these up code what will
10:53 - happen this will be displayed now let's
10:56 - go ahead and run the code so before
10:59 - running the code I'll suggest you to is
11:01 - on the by cutie
11:03 - in a PI charm if you are using the
11:06 - PyCharm ID for running the code so for
11:09 - doing that you need to go to settings
11:11 - and go to project interpreter and you'll
11:16 - have pi QT 5 and pi good if I save and
11:20 - buy QT 5 steps you need to install all
11:23 - these three packages by just clicking by
11:26 - the double clicking on that I'm clicking
11:27 - on the install package once you are
11:29 - picking on install package the package
11:31 - will get installed so in order to get
11:34 - these things you need to do you need to
11:36 - walk on the terminal which is by
11:38 - clicking on that and providing the code
11:41 - as VIP install PI K t-55 by doing so you
11:49 - will get installed your PI 35 so let's
11:53 - go ahead and run the code as we
11:56 - discussed in the last tutorial there are
11:58 - five steps for creating a simple window
12:00 - app that is the first step is input by
12:05 - QT module where you need to where you
12:07 - will be inputting the system followed by
12:09 - you'll be inputting Q application
12:11 - qwidget and Q icon from PI PD Phi dot Q
12:14 - widgets and QT GUI let's copy these and
12:18 - run the code if I am copying it and I'm
12:23 - going to paste in I D I so here we go we
12:28 - have used the required libraries and the
12:33 - next step what we are going to do is we
12:35 - are going to define a method where we
12:36 - will define the title left or fits our
12:39 - hide and followed by creating a one
12:41 - moment creating a method call init UI
12:45 - so we will go we are going to copy this
12:47 - and paste the code accordingly here we
12:52 - go so what happens over here we have
12:57 - opened the class and use the Q widget
13:00 - which we have imported inside the app
13:03 - parentheses and define the method called
13:06 - initialize which is in it underscored
13:09 - escrow in it under squander score and
13:10 - inside the parentheses we have used a
13:12 - self keyword and use the superclass to
13:15 - make sure to
13:16 - accessible of title left of his height
13:18 - in the method of any TI which we are
13:21 - going to get it now so this is the first
13:25 - method we have created it in which we
13:27 - are defined I turn left off width and
13:29 - height now we are going to define the
13:32 - second method which is which will be
13:35 - defining the title and using the cell or
13:38 - title self dot left self dot top cell
13:41 - dot with and self dot height which we
13:43 - have defined in the first method of
13:45 - initializing like defined definition of
13:49 - any so let's go ahead and copy this code
13:57 - here we go so we have finally defined
14:00 - the init UI which is referring to this
14:03 - so we have defined that I need you I and
14:06 - insert the practices we have used the
14:08 - self keyword and by using self dot said
14:12 - window title and inside the parentheses
14:14 - we have if we are referring to this pi
14:17 - codify simple window which is the header
14:19 - of the window and followed by by using
14:22 - set geometry we are defining himself God
14:25 - left self dot top and central bay that
14:28 - self out height which have been defined
14:30 - in the first method which is this one
14:32 - door left off width and height and
14:34 - lastly we are going to use the circuit
14:38 - so to make sure to enable the window app
14:43 - and we are going to create the main
14:48 - method in which we are going to define
14:50 - the app and a variable called X in which
14:53 - we are going to store the app method AB
14:55 - class and lastly we are going to use v
14:58 - dot exit with the system detects it and
15:00 - inside the parenthesis we are going to
15:02 - like call the app which is this Q
15:05 - application and system not argv so this
15:09 - is referring to this so it is referring
15:11 - to this app toward execute underscore
15:14 - and followed by closing the bracket
15:17 - let's go ahead and copy this code
15:27 - get over here so here we go we'll just
15:41 - make some arrangements here we go we
15:47 - have made the arrangements and defined
15:50 - if as well so we have defined the main
15:53 - method and inside the main method we
15:56 - have created an object collab in which
15:59 - we have used the cue application which I
16:02 - have imported from cute pie to defy
16:05 - dorky widgets and inside the parentheses
16:07 - we have forwarding the cyst which you
16:09 - have imported dot argument which is here
16:12 - GV so here we go and then lastly we have
16:17 - created a variable called s in Matias
16:19 - for that and lastly we are going to
16:22 - execute the by prodding sees dot app
16:25 - it's it and inside the process we have
16:27 - ordered the you have call on the app
16:29 - which is this dot execute underscore
16:32 - back by closing the bracket let let's
16:37 - now go ahead and run the program and see
16:39 - whether we get the window in which we
16:42 - have the pie to defy simple window
16:44 - header we are going to run this program
16:51 - let's no wider than the program and look
16:54 - for the output here we go we have got
16:58 - the output he's a PI to defer a simple
17:01 - window and with along with minimize
17:04 - maximize and the close option so we have
17:07 - created the simple big pie codifies like
17:10 - simple window using pi 25
17:15 - so the
17:17 - for today meanwhile I'll explain more
17:20 - the core what happened so in the main
17:23 - application we have : the app so what
17:27 - will happen it will come over here like
17:29 - it will print out the pie qt5 simple
17:32 - window as a header along with cell
17:34 - brought left off we can hide out the
17:37 - 1010 640 and 480 and inside the unit UI
17:41 - we are using the search window title and
17:44 - set geometry inside that as told earlier
17:46 - which is cell rotator top-left with
17:49 - height and everything like we are going
17:52 - to define it inside the parentheses and
17:54 - we are going to use the show till dot
17:56 - show to make sure to enable the window
18:00 - so here we go we have got the output
18:02 - which is a PI 25 simple window yeah we
18:06 - can maximize then minimize and at the
18:09 - end of it i can close the application
18:10 - also so that's it for today thank you
18:16 - for joining with programming knowledge
18:17 - see you in next tutorials bye guys

Cleaned transcript:

hey all welcome to programming knowledge this is a second tutorial of pi PI QT which we'll be looking at set up and the initial steps of doing the program which is the process of doing a program so let us know start off with what we have seen in that last tutorial we have seen what is pi QT and what are the things available in piety like a hoe over how we are going to use that pi QT libraries in order to make sure that you create a good graphical applications along with the support of packet systems and graphical controls so let's now go ahead and set up the pyqt by following the three steps the first step we are going to do is like we'll go to this mention website which is HTTP colon double slash p bi bi dot org slash project slash pyqt of five so we are going to type this address in the like google chrome and then after the website opens like we'll be having a installation tab in that we will find the command called pip install of py QT 5 so we are going to use this command in anaconda command line or Python command prompt line like we are going to use this command to install the pyqt library which will enable us to create the programs for creating graphical applications so let's now go ahead and like set up the pyqt we're following the steps as I have already opened the web page as you can see so here there are so many tabs available you can see the project description then you have autolysis documentation documentation if you want any documentation of the pyqt you can just download it from by clicking here over here then as I say it another installations tab we have py p IP install of py q 2 5 so we are going to copy this and let's is for the pyqt library so it's it's going to take some time as we are downloading like we are going to install the pyqt right so it's downloading from the website and it's getting installed so it will take a little bit of time so we are going to wait for these two hour to get installed after that like we'll start creating the first program so here we go we have plugins for the PI QT 5 library file and no let's go and look at the sample code for getting a sample application with an example so we know what they are going to do we are going to discuss a sim for creating a simple GUI application that is the steps so therefore there five steps involved including a simple GUI application so I am going to create a simple GUI application in which we are going to display a window along with a header called pyqt phi simple window in which will be having minimize maximize and close option button because of shunt app now let's go ahead and check out like will start discuss about the code that we are going to use on creating that application so these are the five steps we are going to use for creating that simpler first we'll import pyqt module in which will be having certain things that needs to be imported for creating the application followed by will be defining a method in this method will define the size like top down right left all the subs will be defined over this method and that said we have what we are going to raise we are going to define a separate method for the title which is going to dispute is going to be displayed on top of the screen next we are going to display the application by using the show method which is a work called show we use the to application lastly we are going to create the main method to run the application these are the five steps required to create that simple G application now let's go ahead and discuss one by one what are the stuffs that are going to be defined inside this first we will discuss about the import by by pyqt module let's go give go ahead and check out that so here we go this is the first step we are going to do like we are going to import pyqt module inside this we inside this we are going to define three things first we'll import the SIS which is a system followed by we are going to import q application and Q which yield from pyqt Phi dot Qt widgets it will be used lastly we are going to import q icon which is available in like from pyqt phi dot g QT g i which comes with a camp called its interface so these are the three things you are going to if I on under I am want be like UT model let's go ahead and see what is the second step I can save as I have told you earlier is defining a method so here in this method what we are going to do we are going to set the title pyqt file simple window and along with that you are going to you find the left top width height and lastly initializing the UI which is in it you are by using the self keyword so here we go like as though as we follow the common rule which is first looking at the class so I have defined the class as and class name as app and inside the paranthesis am called on the Q widget which have imported from pyqt Phi dot QT widgets then then I have defined the like the method has been defined as initialized by using this d EF underscore disclose initialize which is INAT and inside that self commit No and super method has been used followed by Titan left of width height and lastly initializing UI so we are going to do like by the code for these things in defining a method so what is it that thing you are going to do you are going to define a method for tighter let's go and check out the define a method for tighter so inside this I am going to use initially the method as a nit UI and inside the parentheses I have used the keyword as self so by using the self keyword what I am going to do self door set window title as self not title which is the title will be taken which is self dot title as pyqt five simple window that will be displayed inside the window title followed by what I'm going to do I am going to use self dot set geometry and he said the parentheses I am going to call self dot left Tom third or big answer broad height which is 10 10 640 and 480 so these are the things here I am going to define s at the drama tree and lastly I am going to use the the last method which is the fourth method which I have defined as displaying application you can show method so I have used the show method as served or show to like its application and lastly we are going to use the main method to run the application let's go ahead and check out the main method so I have created the main method by defining if underscore disco name underscore underscore equals equals to main and inside that I have used the object called I a PP AB equals to I've used the Q application which we have used in import pyqt module which you have taken from py codified on creating widgets so what will happen I have used the Q application inside that system that sees door argv which have you which I am going to pass on and last didn't people called e.x inside that I'm going to use the a PP like method which is a profit and lastly I'm going to exit the program by using a PP dot execute underscore followed by the packets so here we go no like what will happen of running this program a simple pyqt fire like the window will be opened along with the icons of clothes minimize and maximize with the header which is py q defy simple window which we have defined so this is the overall code for getting the output as expected of output as P by Q define simple window as you can see first be imported then we created the class then we define the method inside that we have defined the title left of width height and lastly like initializing you are i an ID UI then followed by for window title we have defined the method as in init UI and inside that we have used the self keyword and I said the window title and taken the self dot title which we have defined pyqt pi simple window inside the parentheses on set window title then we use the geometry and called on the self dot left and self dot table set dot B ten self not height it is 1010 640 and 480 and lastly we have used the show with her to like display the application and inside the main method we are going to run the application by using the queue application and inside the parentheses as following by save dot argument which you see RGB and you did a sample like like a variable called EXN centered Eastwood AB and lastly in the system exiting the system so here we go after running these up code what will happen this will be displayed now let's go ahead and run the code so before running the code I'll suggest you to is on the by cutie in a PI charm if you are using the PyCharm ID for running the code so for doing that you need to go to settings and go to project interpreter and you'll have pi QT 5 and pi good if I save and buy QT 5 steps you need to install all these three packages by just clicking by the double clicking on that I'm clicking on the install package once you are picking on install package the package will get installed so in order to get these things you need to do you need to walk on the terminal which is by clicking on that and providing the code as VIP install PI K t55 by doing so you will get installed your PI 35 so let's go ahead and run the code as we discussed in the last tutorial there are five steps for creating a simple window app that is the first step is input by QT module where you need to where you will be inputting the system followed by you'll be inputting Q application qwidget and Q icon from PI PD Phi dot Q widgets and QT GUI let's copy these and run the code if I am copying it and I'm going to paste in I D I so here we go we have used the required libraries and the next step what we are going to do is we are going to define a method where we will define the title left or fits our hide and followed by creating a one moment creating a method call init UI so we will go we are going to copy this and paste the code accordingly here we go so what happens over here we have opened the class and use the Q widget which we have imported inside the app parentheses and define the method called initialize which is in it underscored escrow in it under squander score and inside the parentheses we have used a self keyword and use the superclass to make sure to accessible of title left of his height in the method of any TI which we are going to get it now so this is the first method we have created it in which we are defined I turn left off width and height now we are going to define the second method which is which will be defining the title and using the cell or title self dot left self dot top cell dot with and self dot height which we have defined in the first method of initializing like defined definition of any so let's go ahead and copy this code here we go so we have finally defined the init UI which is referring to this so we have defined that I need you I and insert the practices we have used the self keyword and by using self dot said window title and inside the parentheses we have if we are referring to this pi codify simple window which is the header of the window and followed by by using set geometry we are defining himself God left self dot top and central bay that self out height which have been defined in the first method which is this one door left off width and height and lastly we are going to use the circuit so to make sure to enable the window app and we are going to create the main method in which we are going to define the app and a variable called X in which we are going to store the app method AB class and lastly we are going to use v dot exit with the system detects it and inside the parenthesis we are going to like call the app which is this Q application and system not argv so this is referring to this so it is referring to this app toward execute underscore and followed by closing the bracket let's go ahead and copy this code get over here so here we go we'll just make some arrangements here we go we have made the arrangements and defined if as well so we have defined the main method and inside the main method we have created an object collab in which we have used the cue application which I have imported from cute pie to defy dorky widgets and inside the parentheses we have forwarding the cyst which you have imported dot argument which is here GV so here we go and then lastly we have created a variable called s in Matias for that and lastly we are going to execute the by prodding sees dot app it's it and inside the process we have ordered the you have call on the app which is this dot execute underscore back by closing the bracket let let's now go ahead and run the program and see whether we get the window in which we have the pie to defy simple window header we are going to run this program let's no wider than the program and look for the output here we go we have got the output he's a PI to defer a simple window and with along with minimize maximize and the close option so we have created the simple big pie codifies like simple window using pi 25 so the for today meanwhile I'll explain more the core what happened so in the main application we have the app so what will happen it will come over here like it will print out the pie qt5 simple window as a header along with cell brought left off we can hide out the 1010 640 and 480 and inside the unit UI we are using the search window title and set geometry inside that as told earlier which is cell rotator topleft with height and everything like we are going to define it inside the parentheses and we are going to use the show till dot show to make sure to enable the window so here we go we have got the output which is a PI 25 simple window yeah we can maximize then minimize and at the end of it i can close the application also so that's it for today thank you for joining with programming knowledge see you in next tutorials bye guys
