With timestamps:

00:00 - so now here is our uh linux system which
00:03 - we had already installed yesterday if
00:05 - you have not watched the previous video
00:07 - then please go and watch that video
00:08 - because without this uh you will not be
00:10 - able to follow us okay
00:12 - uh if you have already installed and
00:14 - it's fine if you have not installed then
00:16 - you can go for it okay
00:18 - so now what we have to do we have to
00:20 - first off
00:22 - learn the one of the basic command like
00:24 - ls command but before you should have
00:26 - some familiarity with this uh
00:29 - like involvement about linux environment
00:31 - like here you can see the browser web
00:33 - browser mail here you can see the files
00:37 - that just like in our windows system
00:39 - there is no
00:40 - this one file explorer similarly here is
00:42 - also that thing okay you can access the
00:45 - different folders documents
00:48 - and then downloads music whatever thing
00:51 - you will download from web browser it
00:52 - will get downloaded in this particular
00:54 - video
00:55 - in this particular sorry uh download 4
00:58 - directory
00:59 - and there is some public folder
01:03 - and there is nothing okay
01:06 - and also you will get the trash videos
01:09 - pictures all these things okay
01:11 - so these are the all things
01:13 - which you will get
01:16 - so now what we have to do we you will
01:18 - need to first of all open up the
01:20 - terminal
01:21 - uh you can go from
01:23 - here and then you can click on terminal
01:26 - okay
01:27 - but
01:28 - also there is a shortcut for opening the
01:29 - terminal is the control alt t okay
01:33 - so now i will cut this and you can just
01:35 - hit ctrl alt and then
01:38 - d
01:38 - so it will like open one of the terminal
01:42 - so this is our terminal and on this
01:44 - particular thing we will work
01:47 - so let me maximize it
01:50 - i hope it is visible
01:53 - to you
01:55 - okay
01:56 - just wait a minute
01:58 - [Music]
02:02 - you know it should be visible to you
02:04 - guys okay
02:05 - so our the first command which we will
02:08 - uh learn about in this video is the ls
02:10 - command so what is ls command first we
02:13 - will talk about this what is ls command
02:15 - uh just think about lss is nothing but
02:17 - the list the content so we use the ls
02:20 - command to list the contents of a
02:22 - particular directory okay
02:24 - if you are suppose you are in a desktop
02:27 - directory so you want to get all
02:30 - what are the files what are the
02:32 - directors in that particular desktop if
02:34 - you want to get it so you will use a
02:36 - simple command that is called as ls
02:37 - command okay
02:40 - so what we will do we'll just hit ls
02:42 - okay
02:44 - so now i am in the home folder and where
02:46 - you can see the desktop documents
02:48 - downloads music pictures and all these
02:50 - things okay
02:51 - so what i will do for the purpose of
02:53 - showing you
02:56 - i will just open up the files in my hair
03:01 - on my screen
03:02 - i will try to minimize it
03:05 - okay
03:07 - yeah
03:08 - here you can see i'm already on the home
03:11 - directory okay
03:12 - from here you can see also
03:16 - i hope it's visible
03:19 - let me minimize the size of this
03:20 - particular window
03:23 - and yeah
03:26 - now here you can see uh this is the home
03:28 - and the same content which we are
03:31 - getting also here okay
03:32 - so this is the uh
03:34 - main purpose of the command ls so
03:38 - this is the basic uh work which it does
03:40 - like it just lists the content of that
03:42 - particular
03:45 - folder or particular directory in which
03:47 - you are present
03:48 - so if i will go in the desktop and here
03:51 - you can see one file has been created
03:52 - desktop so now what we will do
03:56 - we will just uh
03:58 - here click on open a terminal okay
04:02 - and then now you can see where are you
04:04 - you are in the desktop now here when you
04:06 - will do ls
04:09 - so here also you can see
04:11 - you are getting that particular
04:12 - directory test as it is okay
04:15 - so i hope you got the idea about how the
04:17 - ls works what are the main possible
04:19 - purpose behind this okay
04:22 - so now what we will i will talk about
04:24 - with you is the flags
04:27 - or you can see say the
04:29 - options or arguments
04:31 - so there are many options or arguments
04:34 - which we use with the ls command okay
04:38 - so i will use
04:40 - show you the first one is
04:42 - l hyphen l that is small l so this is
04:45 - the basically the format or you can say
04:47 - the syntax for the
04:49 - like commands like there will be command
04:51 - name then hyphen then the whatever the
04:53 - option which you want to provide with it
04:55 - so what do this command will basically
04:57 - do hyphen l just stands for the long
04:59 - format okay
05:01 - it will show you the all the files and
05:03 - right in the long format
05:05 - so i will just hit enter and now
05:07 - you will learn a thing like wow what
05:10 - what is this now
05:12 - you will get a bit of confused about it
05:14 - okay so let me totally tell you about
05:16 - these things like
05:18 - these are these are the some permissions
05:20 - okay
05:22 - uh
05:23 - like read write execute ah there will be
05:25 - a separate video on this permission
05:27 - because this is a very important topic
05:28 - okay
05:30 - and then there is a user's username
05:32 - group name this is the file size and the
05:35 - dates and all in the last modification
05:38 - date uh time
05:40 - so though i had created the one desktop
05:42 - folder at 1 53 am so that's why it is
05:46 - showing at
05:47 - this time 153 okay
05:50 - so now what i will do uh i will create a
05:53 - one folder in documents okay
05:57 - and here i will do new folder
05:59 - and here i will give it the name as
06:04 - ls command
06:07 - okay
06:08 - here you can see the documents folder
06:10 - and in that we have a ls command now
06:13 - what i will do
06:14 - i will just
06:16 - again hit the lsi funnel
06:19 - okay
06:20 - now you can see the last modification
06:22 - time of that particular uh directory
06:25 - document is
06:26 - 217 and here also you can say it's now
06:28 - 280 now okay i hope you got the idea
06:31 - about this hyphen l format like it
06:34 - basically displays you the
06:36 - result in the long format okay
06:39 - so this is the main purpose of this
06:42 - hyphen l flag
06:44 - now uh let me talk you uh
06:46 - about some other flags like h flag okay
06:50 - so h plug basically
06:52 - uh does the like it will show you the
06:55 - format in the human radial format okay
06:58 - like as you can see this is a 4096 you
07:00 - will not hear what is this basically it
07:02 - is the file size okay
07:04 - and uh if i will do hyphen etch then you
07:07 - will get us some difference ah let me
07:09 - create one more terminal so that you can
07:12 - differentiate between
07:13 - both the result okay
07:17 - let me minimize it
07:21 - my battery is low
07:27 - okay now what i will do here ls hyphen l
07:32 - hyphen h okay we can use the separate uh
07:36 - as a separate flag or we can just
07:38 - combine both uh together i will show you
07:41 - after this okay
07:42 - don't worry about it so here now you can
07:44 - see this is showing me the humidity
07:46 - formula what is 36 it is 36 kb and then
07:50 - 4 kb 4k before kb this is the size of
07:52 - all like directories and there is some
07:57 - basic concept about it i will tell you
07:58 - later on in that particular video when
08:00 - you will come across with the more
08:02 - description about these things like it
08:04 - isn't basically related to the hard
08:06 - links of soft link kind of concept in
08:08 - linux okay
08:09 - so as this is the beginner purpose video
08:11 - so will not cover this at this time
08:13 - otherwise you will get confused okay
08:16 - so uh we i had used a list hyphen l
08:19 - hyphen h okay so now what i will do
08:22 - i'll just combine both things okay
08:24 - hyphen lh
08:26 - as you can see there will be no
08:28 - difference and it will also know
08:30 - uh knows like it will also not provide
08:32 - me like this command is basically like
08:34 - unvaried or anything else
08:36 - so you can see we can write like this
08:38 - also or we can write like this also
08:42 - so now uh one more command you will need
08:45 - to know the clear command
08:48 - what this one will do i hope you guys
08:49 - did right this will just clear all this
08:52 - screen
08:53 - okay i will just hit enter and yeah boom
08:57 - you got clear
08:58 - okay
08:59 - now uh let them move about some other
09:02 - flags which we will use the simple flag
09:05 - is also the a flag what it does
09:08 - you will uh
09:10 - understand like it will list all the
09:12 - files and directory okay uh the hidden
09:15 - files also it will show us
09:17 - and here you can see we are getting the
09:19 - biggest bash history logo bash rc file
09:23 - all these files which we we are getting
09:25 - here okay
09:26 - now let me show you here also so you
09:28 - will
09:29 - get idea about it how it's working you
09:32 - can go here
09:34 - and it should be somewhere like hidden
09:37 - files
09:39 - uh yeah here you can see the show hidden
09:41 - files is unchecked now we will check it
09:44 - and then yeah boom
09:46 - you can see the same result as we have
09:49 - by rc
09:51 - and here is also the best rc file
09:54 - and other some files which are present
09:57 - here also okay
09:58 - so
10:00 - for now i am again unchecking it
10:03 - so it should be simple
10:05 - okay
10:07 - so now uh we can combine the hyphen l
10:09 - option with this also like al
10:12 - we are getting the same thing but what
10:15 - in the long format okay like this is the
10:18 - same permissions numbers some kind of
10:21 - and uh are you sure use this is the
10:23 - username and group and root root is the
10:25 - root
10:27 - user who like we will get about this
10:30 - what is root and all these things when
10:31 - you then we will learn about the user
10:33 - creation things in linux okay
10:37 - so uh
10:38 - i hope you got it the hyphen l option
10:40 - also
10:41 - okay
10:44 - and let me tell you one more uh flag
10:47 - which are important here
10:49 - i like uh
10:51 - hyphen ld okay
10:54 - uh what we will do in this
10:56 - when we will
10:57 - uh combine the l with d directed stands
11:00 - for directory and one to get the details
11:03 - of the
11:04 - let's get documents directory
11:07 - uh yeah
11:09 - now here we can see you you are getting
11:11 - the details for specific directory that
11:15 - is documents okay and here is the same
11:17 - thing that we were getting earlier like
11:20 - uh you can match it with it like
11:22 - documents and
11:24 - also you can see the permissions
11:26 - users group size and the last
11:29 - modification time
11:30 - okay
11:31 - this is the ld so these are the some
11:34 - basic uh
11:35 - flags which you can use with the ls
11:38 - command
11:40 - okay
11:41 - and that's all for today and also if you
11:44 - want more like uh
11:47 - practice on it you can go here also
11:49 - on uh
11:51 - tryhackme.com
11:53 - like this is a platform on which there
11:56 - is a linux
12:00 - tutorial for something you can say
12:06 - wait a minute
12:10 - i i think i got it here
12:15 - [Music]
12:17 - in the lawn
12:20 - that should be in the learning part or
12:22 - somewhere else
12:27 - yeah linux fundamentals
12:30 - okay if you want a more in-depth
12:32 - knowledge or you want to practice some
12:35 - your skills then you can go on this
12:37 - platform also
12:38 - okay
12:40 - so uh
12:43 - that's all for today and i hope
12:45 - you understood about the ls command if
12:48 - you they see it next to just like about
12:50 - your practice if you do more practice
12:51 - you will get more family familiar with
12:53 - it like uh like when i had a study it
12:56 - was like what is this thing and what is
12:59 - this terminal i was getting scared of
13:01 - this drama but when you start practicing
13:03 - with it
13:04 - when you play with this then you will
13:06 - get a idea about yes uh you can
13:08 - understand it okay
13:09 - so that's all for today and uh

13:20 - you thank you so much

Cleaned transcript:

so now here is our uh linux system which we had already installed yesterday if you have not watched the previous video then please go and watch that video because without this uh you will not be able to follow us okay uh if you have already installed and it's fine if you have not installed then you can go for it okay so now what we have to do we have to first off learn the one of the basic command like ls command but before you should have some familiarity with this uh like involvement about linux environment like here you can see the browser web browser mail here you can see the files that just like in our windows system there is no this one file explorer similarly here is also that thing okay you can access the different folders documents and then downloads music whatever thing you will download from web browser it will get downloaded in this particular video in this particular sorry uh download 4 directory and there is some public folder and there is nothing okay and also you will get the trash videos pictures all these things okay so these are the all things which you will get so now what we have to do we you will need to first of all open up the terminal uh you can go from here and then you can click on terminal okay but also there is a shortcut for opening the terminal is the control alt t okay so now i will cut this and you can just hit ctrl alt and then d so it will like open one of the terminal so this is our terminal and on this particular thing we will work so let me maximize it i hope it is visible to you okay just wait a minute you know it should be visible to you guys okay so our the first command which we will uh learn about in this video is the ls command so what is ls command first we will talk about this what is ls command uh just think about lss is nothing but the list the content so we use the ls command to list the contents of a particular directory okay if you are suppose you are in a desktop directory so you want to get all what are the files what are the directors in that particular desktop if you want to get it so you will use a simple command that is called as ls command okay so what we will do we'll just hit ls okay so now i am in the home folder and where you can see the desktop documents downloads music pictures and all these things okay so what i will do for the purpose of showing you i will just open up the files in my hair on my screen i will try to minimize it okay yeah here you can see i'm already on the home directory okay from here you can see also i hope it's visible let me minimize the size of this particular window and yeah now here you can see uh this is the home and the same content which we are getting also here okay so this is the uh main purpose of the command ls so this is the basic uh work which it does like it just lists the content of that particular folder or particular directory in which you are present so if i will go in the desktop and here you can see one file has been created desktop so now what we will do we will just uh here click on open a terminal okay and then now you can see where are you you are in the desktop now here when you will do ls so here also you can see you are getting that particular directory test as it is okay so i hope you got the idea about how the ls works what are the main possible purpose behind this okay so now what we will i will talk about with you is the flags or you can see say the options or arguments so there are many options or arguments which we use with the ls command okay so i will use show you the first one is l hyphen l that is small l so this is the basically the format or you can say the syntax for the like commands like there will be command name then hyphen then the whatever the option which you want to provide with it so what do this command will basically do hyphen l just stands for the long format okay it will show you the all the files and right in the long format so i will just hit enter and now you will learn a thing like wow what what is this now you will get a bit of confused about it okay so let me totally tell you about these things like these are these are the some permissions okay uh like read write execute ah there will be a separate video on this permission because this is a very important topic okay and then there is a user's username group name this is the file size and the dates and all in the last modification date uh time so though i had created the one desktop folder at 1 53 am so that's why it is showing at this time 153 okay so now what i will do uh i will create a one folder in documents okay and here i will do new folder and here i will give it the name as ls command okay here you can see the documents folder and in that we have a ls command now what i will do i will just again hit the lsi funnel okay now you can see the last modification time of that particular uh directory document is 217 and here also you can say it's now 280 now okay i hope you got the idea about this hyphen l format like it basically displays you the result in the long format okay so this is the main purpose of this hyphen l flag now uh let me talk you uh about some other flags like h flag okay so h plug basically uh does the like it will show you the format in the human radial format okay like as you can see this is a 4096 you will not hear what is this basically it is the file size okay and uh if i will do hyphen etch then you will get us some difference ah let me create one more terminal so that you can differentiate between both the result okay let me minimize it my battery is low okay now what i will do here ls hyphen l hyphen h okay we can use the separate uh as a separate flag or we can just combine both uh together i will show you after this okay don't worry about it so here now you can see this is showing me the humidity formula what is 36 it is 36 kb and then 4 kb 4k before kb this is the size of all like directories and there is some basic concept about it i will tell you later on in that particular video when you will come across with the more description about these things like it isn't basically related to the hard links of soft link kind of concept in linux okay so as this is the beginner purpose video so will not cover this at this time otherwise you will get confused okay so uh we i had used a list hyphen l hyphen h okay so now what i will do i'll just combine both things okay hyphen lh as you can see there will be no difference and it will also know uh knows like it will also not provide me like this command is basically like unvaried or anything else so you can see we can write like this also or we can write like this also so now uh one more command you will need to know the clear command what this one will do i hope you guys did right this will just clear all this screen okay i will just hit enter and yeah boom you got clear okay now uh let them move about some other flags which we will use the simple flag is also
