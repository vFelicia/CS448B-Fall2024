00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you what is a
00:04 - function how to declare function and I
00:07 - have given you a small little
00:09 - demonstration of basic function now in
00:12 - this video I'm going to show you how to
00:15 - use function that takes arguments or
00:19 - parameters okay so let's get started for
00:24 - example I want to uh do something useful
00:28 - with the function for example I want to
00:30 - add two values in the function so I can
00:34 - make a function like this um function
00:39 - add right so I can make a function
00:42 - called add and what it does is it adds
00:45 - two values but I want to make this
00:49 - function something like this that it can
00:51 - take any values and add them any two
00:54 - values for example so here in these
00:58 - brackets I can pass arguments or
01:03 - parameters so that those parameters can
01:06 - be added and printed so for example I
01:10 - want to pass first variable which we I
01:13 - call num one comma so whenever you want
01:19 - to pass multiple arguments you separate
01:23 - your argument by comma so just remember
01:25 - this and I will pass the second number
01:28 - for example and be just bear in mind you
01:32 - can provide any number of argument here
01:35 - so it's not restricted that you need to
01:37 - provide only one argument or two or
01:39 - three it's not restricted okay so you
01:43 - can provide any number of
01:45 - arguments you wish but for for now I'm
01:48 - providing two numbers and what I want to
01:51 - do is I want to add these two numbers
01:53 - when this function is called and print
01:56 - this so I can just uh write
02:01 - Echo and I can just uh call these two
02:04 - numbers and add them
02:06 - num
02:08 - one and just I can add with num two
02:15 - which it this should be numb and with
02:19 - this and
02:21 - symbol
02:23 - okay so and let's let me concatenate
02:27 - this with a break
02:31 - BR okay so what I have done I have
02:36 - passed two arguments to my function and
02:40 - whatever I pass here as two numbers it
02:44 - will add those two numbers and print the
02:47 - result so how can I call this function
02:50 - add so just use the same name as your
02:55 - function name and then you need to pass
02:58 - two numbers because it's taking two
03:01 - numerical values so I can pass two
03:03 - numbers something like this
03:07 - 899 comma th000 for example okay and
03:13 - let's see what is the result I call it
03:17 - once and I refresh my Pro program and it
03:21 - gives me the result 1899 which is the
03:24 - addition of these two numbers now
03:26 - suppose I want to um add some more
03:29 - numbers
03:31 - right so I have the requirement of
03:33 - adding these two numbers and for example
03:35 - I want to add some more number so I want
03:40 - to add uh 2,000
03:45 - plus one 1 0 0 and I want to add some
03:51 - other numbers for example
03:54 - 6,000
03:56 - and uh 13 0 0 okay and I will save it
04:02 - and when I run this I can get all these
04:06 - three result and bear in mind there is
04:09 - only one function which are we are using
04:12 - again and again to perform a similar
04:15 - task that's that is the basic definition
04:17 - of function if you remember right a
04:20 - function is used to perform a particular
04:24 - task again and again and this function
04:27 - is doing just that right just we we have
04:31 - just changed those arguments and it's
04:34 - adding those two values right and this
04:37 - is the very basic uh you know importance
04:41 - of functions in any language right it
04:44 - makes your code really readable and it
04:48 - makes uh your code not repeatable and it
04:54 - makes your code to perform a particular
04:57 - task again and again without without
05:00 - writing the code again and again so
05:02 - suppose this function have some you
05:06 - know many numbers of line you cannot
05:09 - write those uh you know many numbers of
05:13 - line again and again it will make your
05:15 - program non-readable but using functions
05:18 - it can be done easily so this is how you
05:21 - can use arguments or parameters with
05:24 - functions in the next video I'm showing
05:27 - I'm going to show you how to return
05:29 - learn value from a function so stay
05:31 - tuned and please write comment and
05:32 - subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you what is a function how to declare function and I have given you a small little demonstration of basic function now in this video I'm going to show you how to use function that takes arguments or parameters okay so let's get started for example I want to uh do something useful with the function for example I want to add two values in the function so I can make a function like this um function add right so I can make a function called add and what it does is it adds two values but I want to make this function something like this that it can take any values and add them any two values for example so here in these brackets I can pass arguments or parameters so that those parameters can be added and printed so for example I want to pass first variable which we I call num one comma so whenever you want to pass multiple arguments you separate your argument by comma so just remember this and I will pass the second number for example and be just bear in mind you can provide any number of argument here so it's not restricted that you need to provide only one argument or two or three it's not restricted okay so you can provide any number of arguments you wish but for for now I'm providing two numbers and what I want to do is I want to add these two numbers when this function is called and print this so I can just uh write Echo and I can just uh call these two numbers and add them num one and just I can add with num two which it this should be numb and with this and symbol okay so and let's let me concatenate this with a break BR okay so what I have done I have passed two arguments to my function and whatever I pass here as two numbers it will add those two numbers and print the result so how can I call this function add so just use the same name as your function name and then you need to pass two numbers because it's taking two numerical values so I can pass two numbers something like this 899 comma th000 for example okay and let's see what is the result I call it once and I refresh my Pro program and it gives me the result 1899 which is the addition of these two numbers now suppose I want to um add some more numbers right so I have the requirement of adding these two numbers and for example I want to add some more number so I want to add uh 2,000 plus one 1 0 0 and I want to add some other numbers for example 6,000 and uh 13 0 0 okay and I will save it and when I run this I can get all these three result and bear in mind there is only one function which are we are using again and again to perform a similar task that's that is the basic definition of function if you remember right a function is used to perform a particular task again and again and this function is doing just that right just we we have just changed those arguments and it's adding those two values right and this is the very basic uh you know importance of functions in any language right it makes your code really readable and it makes uh your code not repeatable and it makes your code to perform a particular task again and again without without writing the code again and again so suppose this function have some you know many numbers of line you cannot write those uh you know many numbers of line again and again it will make your program nonreadable but using functions it can be done easily so this is how you can use arguments or parameters with functions in the next video I'm showing I'm going to show you how to return learn value from a function so stay tuned and please write comment and subscribe and bye for now
