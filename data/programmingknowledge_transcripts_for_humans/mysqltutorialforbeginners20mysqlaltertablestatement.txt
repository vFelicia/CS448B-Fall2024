00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in our earlier videos we saw
00:06 - that if we want to modify or update the
00:10 - values present in our table then we can
00:13 - use update tables come on now if we want
00:17 - to modify or alter the structure of the
00:21 - table also then we can do this with the
00:24 - help of alter table command so let us
00:29 - first open terminal MySQL - you root - P
00:48 - okay so databases so we have data test
00:58 - database here just use that now let us
01:09 - see which are the tables present in our
01:11 - database as you can see we have to run
01:19 - table and temp table so for this
01:24 - particular example we use temp table
01:27 - because we don't want to modify this
01:32 - student table okay so let me first see
01:36 - select star from
01:46 - okay so it has no values let us see
01:51 - describe table okay so as you can see it
02:00 - has only one column ID and it has
02:04 - integer deducted so let us first thing
02:08 - if you want to add a column a new column
02:12 - in your table then how do you get so
02:17 - right alter table and then specify the
02:27 - table name in our case it is 10 then
02:37 - write add then the name of the column
02:43 - that do you want to create let us create
02:46 - name and the data type all right we're
02:51 - care let's say 40 and the if you want to
03:01 - specify any constraint like null not
03:04 - null primary key we specify null here
03:09 - okay so it can be null and fire now run
03:17 - again describe table as you can see the
03:23 - new column has been added in our tap
03:26 - depe and it has type of worker and make
03:30 - homeless is 30 as we specified okay now
03:36 - if you want to add multiple columns at
03:39 - once now right alter table
03:52 - the name of the column that you want to
03:55 - insert let's say surname data type let's
04:04 - say 40 of month and it can be nothing
04:10 - now I want to add another column oops
04:18 - instead add here alter table the name of
04:24 - the table then add new column name
04:29 - surname and it has worker of data type
04:32 - and length is 30 and it can be null now
04:37 - we want to add another column name let's
04:42 - say salary integer let's say 100 and it
04:51 - can be null hours okay now fire describe
04:58 - temple as you can see - you know face or
05:02 - columns has been added in our temp table
05:05 - that is surname and salary so now if we
05:14 - want to modify a column that already
05:18 - present in your table then we use modify
05:22 - write alter table the name of the table
05:36 - now modify now we have salary is in 100
05:51 - now let's say I want to change the data
05:55 - type of salary to worker okay and in
06:02 - real world salary cannot be in worker
06:07 - for the sake of understanding let us
06:10 - send the data type of salary to worker
06:15 - so modify salary to worker let us say 10
06:27 - and it can be null okay as you can see
06:37 - the data type of salary has been changed
06:42 - you can also change the null constraint
06:45 - we can set we can set it to null because
06:50 - salva can be null but if we want it to
06:55 - be not null okay as you can see now if
07:06 - you want to delete or drop a column in
07:09 - your table then we can use drop fall of
07:13 - command right alter table the name of
07:22 - the table drop column and the name of
07:30 - the column that you want to delete now I
07:35 - want to delete salary column okay so I
07:39 - write salary
07:43 - please enter describe table to see the
07:49 - structure of your table as you can see
07:52 - the salary has been removed from up
07:54 - table
07:57 - now if you want to rename the column in
08:01 - your table then we can use change column
08:05 - command right alter table the name of
08:13 - the table can change
08:19 - column the old name of the column that
08:26 - are present in your table let's say I D
08:30 - and I want to change it to roll number
08:34 - okay now you have to specify the
08:40 - definition of that column definition by
08:45 - me in the data type and the constraint
08:48 - so the data type is int 11 it can it it
09:00 - can it can be nervous okay
09:04 - enter as you can see the name of the ID
09:11 - has been spin to roll now if you want to
09:17 - rename the entire table then also you
09:20 - can do it with the help of alter command
09:23 - right alter table name of the table
09:33 - rename - we use a rename to the new name
09:42 - of the table that you want to give let's
09:45 - say temp - okay now we use show tables
09:53 - as you can see the name of the table has
09:59 - been changed from Tam to temp - so these
10:05 - are the example of operations that you
10:07 - can perform using alter command and now
10:12 - just close this open MySQL workbench
10:26 - let us see one example let us add one
10:34 - column in timetable okay we change the
10:41 - name of c10 okay alter table the name of
10:52 - the table temp to add we want to have
11:01 - let's say Saturday in 200 it can be null
11:14 - okay fire this describe once again as
11:21 - you can see salary is added to our table
11:25 - and all your percent that we have
11:28 - performed in our terminal the same
11:30 - approach on you can perform in MySQL
11:32 - workbench there will be no difference
11:35 - okay thanks for watching

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in our earlier videos we saw that if we want to modify or update the values present in our table then we can use update tables come on now if we want to modify or alter the structure of the table also then we can do this with the help of alter table command so let us first open terminal MySQL you root P okay so databases so we have data test database here just use that now let us see which are the tables present in our database as you can see we have to run table and temp table so for this particular example we use temp table because we don't want to modify this student table okay so let me first see select star from okay so it has no values let us see describe table okay so as you can see it has only one column ID and it has integer deducted so let us first thing if you want to add a column a new column in your table then how do you get so right alter table and then specify the table name in our case it is 10 then write add then the name of the column that do you want to create let us create name and the data type all right we're care let's say 40 and the if you want to specify any constraint like null not null primary key we specify null here okay so it can be null and fire now run again describe table as you can see the new column has been added in our tap depe and it has type of worker and make homeless is 30 as we specified okay now if you want to add multiple columns at once now right alter table the name of the column that you want to insert let's say surname data type let's say 40 of month and it can be nothing now I want to add another column oops instead add here alter table the name of the table then add new column name surname and it has worker of data type and length is 30 and it can be null now we want to add another column name let's say salary integer let's say 100 and it can be null hours okay now fire describe temple as you can see you know face or columns has been added in our temp table that is surname and salary so now if we want to modify a column that already present in your table then we use modify write alter table the name of the table now modify now we have salary is in 100 now let's say I want to change the data type of salary to worker okay and in real world salary cannot be in worker for the sake of understanding let us send the data type of salary to worker so modify salary to worker let us say 10 and it can be null okay as you can see the data type of salary has been changed you can also change the null constraint we can set we can set it to null because salva can be null but if we want it to be not null okay as you can see now if you want to delete or drop a column in your table then we can use drop fall of command right alter table the name of the table drop column and the name of the column that you want to delete now I want to delete salary column okay so I write salary please enter describe table to see the structure of your table as you can see the salary has been removed from up table now if you want to rename the column in your table then we can use change column command right alter table the name of the table can change column the old name of the column that are present in your table let's say I D and I want to change it to roll number okay now you have to specify the definition of that column definition by me in the data type and the constraint so the data type is int 11 it can it it can it can be nervous okay enter as you can see the name of the ID has been spin to roll now if you want to rename the entire table then also you can do it with the help of alter command right alter table name of the table rename we use a rename to the new name of the table that you want to give let's say temp okay now we use show tables as you can see the name of the table has been changed from Tam to temp so these are the example of operations that you can perform using alter command and now just close this open MySQL workbench let us see one example let us add one column in timetable okay we change the name of c10 okay alter table the name of the table temp to add we want to have let's say Saturday in 200 it can be null okay fire this describe once again as you can see salary is added to our table and all your percent that we have performed in our terminal the same approach on you can perform in MySQL workbench there will be no difference okay thanks for watching
