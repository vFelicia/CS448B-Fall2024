00:21 - software uh that we use to run different
00:24 - operating system in our main host okay
00:27 - so our main host here means that our one
00:29 - this operating system that that this one
00:31 - which i'm using right now that is
00:32 - windows 11 okay so in this operating
00:35 - system we are going to use
00:37 - another operating system with the help
00:38 - of virtualbox okay i hope that is clear
00:40 - to you like what is a virtualbox
00:43 - okay so basically we will uh
00:46 - install ubuntu os but before that you

12:21 - take i think a little bit of time
12:25 - it'll just though whatever the package
12:27 - is that has been installed by the system
12:29 - then it will just unpack all the
12:31 - all those things
12:42 - so let's wait for it
12:44 - don't know how much time will it take
12:48 - [Music]
12:56 - unpacking linux headers
13:00 - okay nice
13:02 - [Music]
13:12 - it should not take much time i don't
13:14 - know why it's taking much time
13:17 - packing insiders so
13:34 - okay preparing now it's preparing
13:45 - [Music]
13:52 - so guys now you can see our installation
13:54 - has been completed and this is the like
13:56 - information box you will get after the
13:58 - com after the successful installation
14:01 - now it's asking to restart now so i'll
14:04 - just hit on restart now
14:16 - then it will ask for the whatever the

14:54 - so we will check uh how we can increase
14:56 - the particular screen size to full
14:58 - screen
15:00 - okay
15:02 - so first of all we will need to login
15:04 - into the system

15:08 - it
15:08 - then we can easily
15:10 - go into the full screen mode
15:15 - and this is the first time so that's why
15:17 - it's taking a little bit of more time
15:20 - as compared to
15:22 - like uh
15:23 - old install system
15:27 - so let's wait for it
15:53 - now here you can see uh
