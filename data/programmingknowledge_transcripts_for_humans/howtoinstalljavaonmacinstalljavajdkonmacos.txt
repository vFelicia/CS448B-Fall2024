00:47 - which says no Java Runtime present
00:49 - requesting install and you will see this
00:52 - kind of pop-up
00:53 - also if Java is installed you will see
00:55 - the version of Java which is installed
00:57 - on your Mac operating system so what we
01:00 - are going to do is we are going to click
01:01 - on this button which says more info and
01:04 - this is going to open the official
01:06 - Oracle website and here you will be able
01:09 - to find directly the version of Java

01:25 - appear here will be this website link so
01:28 - I'm going to just click on this link
01:30 - which will redirect me to the same page
01:33 - which I have seen here ok so here what
01:38 - you need to do is you need to click on
01:40 - JDK download and as I said at the time
01:44 - of making this video the latest version
01:46 - is Java SE 14 so we are going to install
01:48 - the version 14 on our Mac operating
01:50 - system now here when we will scroll down
01:54 - you will be able to see the packages for
01:58 - different operating system so we want to
02:01 - install it on our Mac operating system
02:03 - so we are going to choose the Mac OS
02:05 - installer so just click on the link
02:10 - which is in front of the Mac installer
02:12 - which
02:13 - we'll be the file with the dot dmg

02:18 - this link and then just check this
02:21 - checkbox and then click on the download
02:23 - button so this is going to start the
02:26 - download of this JDK file on your Mac
02:31 - operating system and then just choose a
02:33 - file and then click on OK which is going
02:35 - to start the download so this is around
02:38 - 176 megabyte file so it will take some
02:41 - time to download so once this dmg file
02:43 - is downloaded you just need to click on
02:45 - this dmg file which is going to open
02:48 - this kind of installation wizard
02:52 - let me just minimize the browser and the
02:54 - terminal also so once this window opens
02:57 - you will be able to see this JDK 14
03:00 - point 0 point 1 dot pkg file so 14 point
03:04 - 0 point 1 is the version we are going to
03:07 - install right so just double click on
03:09 - this JDK package file which is going to
03:13 - start this installation wizard so here
03:17 - just click on continue here and then
03:19 - click on the install button and then you
03:23 - just need to give your Mac operating
03:25 - systems password so just provide the
03:27 - power us word of your Mac operating
03:28 - system click install software which is
03:32 - going to start the installation of Java
03:34 - on your Mac operating system and in few
03:38 - seconds you will see this message it
03:40 - says install succeeded which means the
03:43 - Java JDK is successfully installed on
03:45 - your Mac operating system so just close
03:48 - this file and then you can just click on
03:51 - move to tress which is going to move
03:54 - this file to trash because we already
03:56 - have installed Java on our Mac operating
03:59 - system now once Java is installed on
04:02 - your Mac operating system you can also
04:05 - set the Java home environment variable
04:07 - on your Mac operating system so what I'm
04:11 - going to do is I'm going to just quit
04:13 - this terminal and I'm going to open the
04:15 - terminal once again so just search for
04:17 - the terminal once again and I'm going to
04:19 - open the terminal once again and now I
04:22 - have all the commands which I
04:25 - have listed here so to know the location
04:28 - of your Java home you just need to give
04:32 - this command I'm going to provide all
04:33 - these commands in the description of
04:35 - this video also so this command is going
04:38 - to give you the Java home path so I'm
04:42 - going to just give this command and then
04:45 - press ENTER and you can see we are going
04:48 - to set this Java home path into our
04:52 - environment variable as Java home so
04:55 - once we know the Java home path we can
04:59 - give this next command so we just need
05:01 - to open this dot Bash underscore profile
05:05 - file with any editor of your choice so
05:09 - you can give this command open till they
05:12 - power slash dot bash underscore profile
05:15 - or any editor of your choice
05:18 - you can list out this bash profile in
05:22 - your home directory also so just open
05:24 - your terminal and just give LS - al
05:29 - command and you will be able to see this
05:31 - bash profile file here also ok so what
05:36 - I'm going to do is I'm going to just
05:38 - clear this terminal and then I'm going
05:41 - to open this file using my editor which
05:44 - is Visual Studio code so I'm going to
05:46 - just write code and then the path of
05:49 - this bash underscore profile you can as
05:52 - I said use open also to open this file
05:56 - or whim to open this file or Nano to
06:00 - open this file so the editor choice is
06:03 - yours so I'm going to open it with the
06:06 - code editor which is Visual Studio code
06:09 - in my case and here at the very bottom
06:14 - I'm going to export this path so to
06:17 - export this path you just need to just
06:20 - write export Java home in capital all in
06:23 - capital right so just at the end just
06:26 - right
06:27 - export Java home is equal to and the
06:30 - path which you have found using this
06:33 - command which is this part so I'm going
06:36 - to just copy this path up to
06:38 - home from but the terminal and then
06:41 - paste it after equals to sign okay so
06:45 - once you are done you can just save this
06:48 - file so I'm going to just save this file
06:50 - and then I'm going to move to the next
06:53 - command which is source till the /khroe
06:57 - file file is going to refresh your bash
06:59 - profile in the terminal so you if next
07:03 - time when you give this Java home
07:04 - command it's going to give you the value
07:07 - of that till they forward slash dot bash
07:09 - underscore profile and then press enter
07:12 - and now you can echo the value of your
07:16 - Java home variable so just write echo
07:19 - and then dollar Java underscore home all
07:23 - in capital press ENTER and it's going to
07:26 - give you the value of Java home also you
07:30 - can give the Java version command so I'm
07:33 - going to clear the terminal and this
07:35 - time I'm going to give the Java -
07:38 - version command and then press ENTER and
07:41 - it's going to give me the version of
07:44 - Java which is installed on my Mac
07:48 - operating system so as you can see we
07:51 - have installed Java 14 point 0.1 so it's
07:53 - going to give us this version you can
07:56 - also give Java C
07:58 - - version command so Java C is used to
08:02 - compile or build your Java programs and
08:05 - it's going to give you this kind of
08:08 - version so this also is fourteen point
08:10 - zero point one now let's do something
08:13 - interesting let's create a file Java
08:16 - file and we are going to compile this
08:19 - file using Java C and run our program
08:22 - using Java command so what I'm going to
08:25 - do is I'm going to CD to my desk top
08:29 - folder so to create a Java file you just
08:33 - need to navigate to the location where
08:34 - you want to create this file I want to
08:37 - create this file into my desktop folder
08:39 - so I'm going to just go to my desktop
08:41 - folder right now I don't have any file
08:44 - in my desktop folder so I'm going to
08:46 - create it using touch command and then
08:49 - I'm going to write the name of my file
08:52 - which is hello world file and then you
08:57 - need to give the extension Java to it
09:00 - okay so touch HelloWorld dot Java and
09:03 - once you do that you can see when you do
09:06 - LS this file name is there which means
09:10 - this file is created now you can open
09:13 - this file using any editor of your
09:16 - choice you can use Eclipse IDE or
09:20 - NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA also for
09:23 - compiling your Java code I'm going to
09:27 - use code editor which is Visual Studio
09:29 - code editor for compiling and editing
09:33 - this file so just write code and
09:34 - HelloWorld dot Java file name and it's
09:38 - going to open your helloworld.java file
09:41 - into an editor it can be any editor as I
09:44 - said now here I'm going to just give a
09:48 - simple hello world code this code you
09:51 - can find easily on internet anywhere so
09:54 - I'm going to not go into the details of
09:56 - this program we are just interested in
09:59 - compiling and running this program so
10:02 - this is just printing HelloWorld on the
10:04 - terminal when it's compiled once you
10:07 - have this code just save this code and
10:09 - then go to the terminal once again and
10:12 - to compile your code you just need to
10:14 - give Java C and the name of your file
10:16 - which is HelloWorld dot Java in our case
10:18 - and must you do that you can see that
10:21 - this file is created in your folder ok
10:27 - so if you see this file that means your
10:30 - compilation has both worked successfully
10:33 - so we just need to run it using the Java
10:37 - command so once you see this file you
10:40 - can give Java and the name of your
10:43 - executable file which is hello world in
10:45 - our case you don't need to give this dot
10:48 - class extension after your hello world
10:51 - program you just need to give this name
10:54 - which you see here before dot class ok
10:58 - so Java and then HelloWorld and when you
11:01 - press Enter
11:02 - you will see hello world is printed that
11:04 - means our java and javac c commands are
11:08 - working so as i said
11:10 - java c is for compiling your program and
11:13 - java command is for running your java
11:16 - program this is how you can download and
11:19 - install java on your mac operating
11:21 - system i hope you've enjoyed this video
11:23 - and i will see you in the next video
