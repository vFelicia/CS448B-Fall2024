With timestamps:

00:01 - so Alan welcome back to the new video of
00:03 - the maven tutorial Series so now in this
00:07 - video we will see uh some hot questions
00:10 - or
00:12 - frequently Asked question in the maven
00:14 - interview questions if you are applying
00:16 - for any job uh which job requires a
00:19 - maven as a job requirement so so the
00:23 - interview in interview you can expect
00:25 - these kind of questions been asked okay
00:28 - so we'll answer each question one by one
00:30 - uh and try to solve
00:33 - then as well okay so let's go and take
00:37 - our first question uh first question is
00:39 - what is Maven okay so Maven is a project
00:42 - management tool it is based on form
00:44 - which is Project object model uh we have
00:47 - also covered uh separate videos on form
00:49 - if you haven't checked that go ahead and
00:52 - check uh where we have discussed all the
00:56 - fire details regarding the pump file
00:58 - wire pump file is important in Maven
01:00 - okay so the next question is what
01:03 - aspects are managed by Parvin Maven
01:05 - sorry okay so the aspects that are
01:08 - management is builds documentation
01:11 - reporting scms release and distribution
01:14 - these are the various aspects which are
01:17 - managed by Maven okay so the what are
01:20 - the advantages of using Maven why we use
01:22 - Maven okay so the very first Advantage
01:26 - is no need to add jar file in each
01:29 - project
01:29 - it creates the right direct directory
01:33 - structure and it builds and deploys the
01:36 - project and it also manages manages our
01:38 - dependencies and plugins so seamlessly
01:41 - that we need uh that we need not need to
01:45 - worry about our dependencies as well
01:47 - okay so that is one of the advantages of
01:50 - Maven as well okay so the what are the
01:52 - command to check the maven version okay
01:54 - so the command is mvn space minus
01:58 - version or else you can also type mvn
02:02 - let me write it out m v n minus V or or
02:08 - you can write m v n space minus version
02:11 - any one of this can
02:14 - you can write any one of these you have
02:16 - to find the maven version you are
02:19 - currently using okay so next question is
02:22 - what does the build tool do
02:26 - okay so it generates the source code
02:28 - if the auto generated code is used okay
02:31 - and it generates the documentation from
02:33 - source code okay and another user it's
02:36 - compiles our source code also which is
02:39 - written in a Java
02:41 - okay so the package is compiled code
02:43 - into jar or zip file this is one of the
02:47 - uh uses of the build tool and it also
02:50 - installs the packaged code in the local
02:53 - repository server repository or the
02:55 - central repository okay so now next
02:58 - question is what is the difference
03:00 - between and and Maven so and is a
03:04 - toolbox whereas the maven is a framework
03:06 - right and it is and and is mainly a
03:10 - build tool and Maven is mainly a project
03:13 - management tool and and there is no life
03:15 - cycle and in Maven we have life cycle
03:18 - and we have also seen what are the
03:20 - different phases of the life cycle also
03:22 - and and doesn't have formal conventions
03:25 - and Maven has a convention to place
03:27 - source code and compiled report
03:29 - Etc uh and is procedural and Maven is
03:33 - declarative why declarative because we
03:35 - declare our dependencies in the form.xml
03:37 - file right and and if and scripts are
03:40 - not reusable whereas the maven plugins
03:43 - are reusable we can use Maven plugins as
03:45 - and when required okay so
03:48 - seventh question is Define archetype
03:51 - okay so what is our type in Maven oh it
03:56 - is in Maven that type it is a maven
04:00 - plugin which is designed for creation of
04:02 - the project structure so as we have seen
04:05 - in a previous video when we are trying
04:06 - to create the web application we have
04:09 - selected the arch type as web app so it
04:11 - is nothing but the structure that is
04:13 - predefined by the maven so if you start
04:15 - if you want to create a web application
04:17 - you just go ahead and select the arc tab
04:19 - as web application there are many more
04:21 - archipers are there you can select
04:23 - according to your requirement okay so
04:27 - the next question is what is the purpose
04:30 - of mvn clean command Okay so the command
04:33 - so the ambient link command removes the
04:35 - target directory before starting of a
04:38 - build process okay so imagine one
04:40 - scenario if you are created if you are
04:43 - build one project the target project
04:45 - will get created and next time you do
04:48 - some modification and your try again
04:49 - trying to create that build so in order
04:53 - to delete the previous Target folder
04:56 - command so that the previous build
04:59 - Target folder will get removed from the
05:02 - directory and after that you can again
05:05 - build the project and again the target
05:07 - target folder will be get created
05:11 - okay so next is uh what are the build
05:15 - phases in Maven okay so what are the
05:18 - different build phases in manual so
05:20 - first is validate compile test package
05:23 - integration test verify install and then
05:25 - deploy each one of these build phases
05:28 - are covered in depth in now in our
05:30 - previous previous video of this tutorial
05:32 - series you can go ahead and watch that
05:35 - videos as well and next one is what is a
05:39 - repository in maven
05:41 - okay so what is a repository in
05:47 - manual this is our last question uh okay
05:51 - so the repository is a directory or a
05:53 - place where all the jars and form.xml
05:56 - files are stored okay so the mainly the
05:59 - repositories are of three three times we
06:01 - have seen on a as in our in our videos
06:03 - as well one is local repository one is
06:06 - Central repository and one is a remote
06:08 - repositories okay so these are the type
06:11 - three types of repositories are there in
06:13 - mavina okay so these are the hot or
06:16 - frequently asked questions in the maven
06:18 - interviews okay so if you are preparing
06:21 - for the marriage interviews you go ahead
06:23 - and uh
06:25 - check these videos check this our Maven
06:30 - tutorial series and learn the maven
06:32 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

so Alan welcome back to the new video of the maven tutorial Series so now in this video we will see uh some hot questions or frequently Asked question in the maven interview questions if you are applying for any job uh which job requires a maven as a job requirement so so the interview in interview you can expect these kind of questions been asked okay so we'll answer each question one by one uh and try to solve then as well okay so let's go and take our first question uh first question is what is Maven okay so Maven is a project management tool it is based on form which is Project object
