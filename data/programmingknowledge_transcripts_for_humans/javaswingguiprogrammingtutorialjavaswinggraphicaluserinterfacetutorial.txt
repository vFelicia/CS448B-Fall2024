03:35 - then click yes and I'm going to minimize
03:39 - this folder explorer and I'm going to
03:42 - minimize this browser also and once your
03:45 - Eclipse installer is started you will
03:48 - see the interface like this so you will
03:51 - be able to download a Eclipse IDE for
03:54 - Java developers from here or Eclipse IDE
03:57 - for Java EE developers or Eclipse IDE
04:01 - for C++ PHP and other languages so what
04:05 - we are going to do is we are going to
04:06 - install the first option which is
04:09 - Eclipse IDE for Java developers so I'm
04:12 - going to click on this option and now
04:16 - you will see the next window here and
04:18 - this will be the location where Eclipse
04:20 - IDE will be installed and then it says
04:23 - create start menu entry and create
04:27 - stop shortcut I want both of them so I
04:30 - will give everything as default and I'm
04:32 - going to click on the install button and
04:35 - first of all you will see this kind of
04:38 - license terms and conditions so I'm
04:41 - going to click on accept now which is
04:44 - going to start the installation of
04:45 - Eclipse IDE so now the installation of
04:48 - this Eclipse IDE has been completed and
04:50 - I can see this launch button so I'm
04:53 - going to click on this which is going to
04:55 - launch the Eclipse IDE on my Windows 10
04:59 - operating system and first of all when
05:00 - Eclipse IDE starts after the
05:02 - installation it will ask you to select
05:04 - our directory as a workspace so if you
05:08 - want to change this workspace directory
05:10 - you can browse for that directory which
05:13 - you want to set it as a workspace and
05:16 - then you can just click on use it as a
05:20 - default and then I'm going to just click
05:23 - on the launch button which is going to
05:25 - launch the Eclipse IDE and now you can
05:28 - see this Eclipse IDE has been started so
05:31 - let's create a Java project in order to
05:34 - verify if everything is working fine so
05:36 - first of all what I will do is I will
05:39 - just click on this file option and I'm
05:43 - going to just go to new and then I'm
05:46 - going to just click on this option which
05:49 - says Java project and then I'm going to
05:53 - just give the name of my Java project
05:56 - which is hollow bold and then you can
05:58 - see under JRE Java SE 10 is chosen
06:01 - automatically by Eclipse IDE for us if
06:05 - you have the different version other
06:06 - than Java
06:08 - SC 10 then that version will be
06:10 - displayed here ok and then under the
06:14 - project layout there are two options use
06:16 - the project folder as the root for the
06:18 - source and the class file and other s
06:21 - create a separate folder for source and
06:23 - class file so I will also leave this as
06:25 - default and I'm going to click on the
06:28 - next button and here you will be able to
06:31 - do more settings about your Java project
06:34 - I am going to leave everything as
06:35 - default and I'm going to click on finish
06:38 - and I'm going to just
06:41 - click on create' button and this is
06:43 - going to create your helloworld.java
06:45 - project now you will see here this Java
06:48 - project is not shown here because I need
06:51 - to minimize this welcome window so just
06:54 - click on this minimize button which is
06:56 - going to minimize this welcome window
06:58 - and then you will be able to see this
07:01 - kind of hello world project here so you
07:04 - can see our Java project has been
07:06 - created and this has a file called
07:10 - module - info dot Java for now I'm going
07:14 - to just remove this file and I will
07:16 - create a new class file so I'm going to
07:20 - just right click on the source and then
07:22 - I'm going to choose new and then I'm
07:24 - going to choose the class option from
07:26 - here and I want to name my class as demo
07:30 - for example and then I'm going to leave
07:33 - everything as default and in here under
07:36 - which method stop would you like to
07:39 - create I'm going to choose this checkbox
07:42 - which says public static void main which
07:45 - is going to create this public static
07:48 - void main method for me and I'm going to
07:50 - click finish for now and this is going
07:53 - to create this demo dot Java class and
07:56 - here you can see public static void main
07:57 - method has been created so let's print
08:00 - something so I'm going to just write
08:02 - system dot out dot print Ln for print
08:09 - line and let's print HelloWorld for now
08:12 - so I'm going to just write hello world
08:15 - in between the double quotes and I'm
08:18 - going to save this Java file and I'm
08:20 - going to run this Java file using this
08:24 - green button here and you can see hello
08:27 - world is displayed on the console so in
08:30 - this way you can download and install
08:32 - Eclipse IDE on your windows 10 operating
08:34 - system hello guys in this video I'm
08:37 - going to show you how you can install a
08:39 - window builder plug-in in your Eclipse
08:42 - IDE it's also called GUI plug-in and
08:46 - this GUI plug-in enables you to develop
08:50 - your Java GUI applications in Eclipse so
08:54 - let's see
08:55 - we can install this window builder
08:57 - plugin so fire up your Eclipse and go to
09:01 - the help tab here and then go to install
09:05 - new software and in here in the work
09:11 - with space here you need to click this
09:17 - combo box here this one it will give you
09:21 - some options and what we want to choose
09:24 - here is HTTP colon slash slash download
09:29 - dot eclipse.org e it will be there also
09:32 - in your Eclipse also slash release slash
09:38 - I have the latest version which is Luna
09:42 - but if you have some other version it
09:45 - will show you that version of Eclipse
09:47 - for example Juno or Kepler so just
09:51 - select this option which says HTTP slash
09:54 - download dot eclipse.org e / literally
09:57 - release slash whatever version of
10:01 - Eclipse you have I have Luna so I will
10:03 - select this Luna ok and this will give
10:08 - you some options here what option we are
10:12 - interested in is called journal purse
10:15 - tool this one ok so just select this
10:19 - general purpose tool and then search for
10:23 - so go down a little and in here we are
10:28 - searching for swing designer so
10:32 - everything which is under this wing
10:36 - design or below this swing designer we
10:38 - need to check this so this is swing
10:40 - designer and I check all the options
10:45 - below swing designer up to the end of
10:49 - window builder
10:53 - all these things windowbuilder so all
11:00 - these option which says windowbuilder
11:02 - or spring designer you need to check ok
11:05 - window builder and swing designer ok and
11:12 - once you are selected all these options
11:16 - related to Windows builder and swing
11:17 - designer what you need to do you need to
11:21 - just click this next button and
11:27 - calculate the requirement and
11:29 - dependencies it will give you this list
11:32 - here and you can review your items once
11:36 - again and click Next and this is the
11:40 - license terms condition you say I accept
11:44 - terms of license agreement and click
11:47 - finish and then the installation of
11:51 - software will start it will take some
11:57 - time depending upon the speed of your
12:01 - internet and the selection of your files
12:04 - so if you have selected more files or
12:07 - more software to install it will take
12:10 - more time and let's see how much time it
12:14 - takes here if it will take more time I
12:18 - will just pause the video and restart it
12:21 - once its installed
12:38 - I think I will pause the video once it
12:41 - these this installation is complete and
12:44 - then I will continue with this video
12:47 - okay or it's already finishing yes it's
12:53 - finished okay so it says you will need
12:57 - to restart Eclipse for the changes to
13:00 - take effect what do you like to restart
13:03 - so I will say yes I want to restart and
13:07 - restart my Eclipse you see I have
13:12 - eclipse Luna installed which is the
13:15 - latest version at the time of making
13:17 - this video
13:29 - and load all of your plugin you have
13:34 - installed
13:39 - and now eclipse has started okay so once
13:44 - you have successfully installed these
13:47 - window bleep in the plugin and swing
13:50 - designer plugin you can develop project
13:55 - using these window builder and swing the
13:58 - banner so how you can create a new
14:01 - project using these windowbuilder just
14:05 - go to file new Java project and in here
14:15 - you will be able to see the options to
14:18 - make the Java project but I think I
14:21 - should go to new and in here you should
14:26 - go to others right so go to new and then
14:30 - it will show the options others go to
14:35 - others or other and in here
14:39 - such or windowbuilder
14:42 - so this is the window builder and in
14:47 - here such or swing designer and select
14:51 - application window okay
14:54 - so go to window builder swing designer
14:57 - and select this application window here
15:00 - okay and click Next and now you just
15:05 - need to give the path or give the path
15:13 - to your or give the name to your project
15:17 - I will give the name to my project as
15:27 - hello world project and for example I
15:31 - want to change this location of the
15:34 - folder I can choose the location right
15:39 - now I've already have this project hello
15:42 - world here
15:43 - so I've not changed the default location
15:46 - but yeah I can do it with and it says
15:50 - type the name with same name but
15:53 - different case exists so I will say
16:01 - hello world laughs for example and this
16:08 - is the use of default package is
16:10 - discouraged I will go and finish this
16:19 - and now I will have this designer tool
16:25 - here so it has generated me this code
16:30 - and when I go to this design tab it we
16:35 - are run right now in the source tab so
16:38 - when we go in the design tab
16:44 - we will be able to see the design view
16:47 - of this code so this is what Eclipse
16:51 - windowbuilder has generated for us it
16:55 - will take some time to go into the
16:58 - design of you for the first time and you
17:03 - see we are in the design view okay so
17:08 - this is the frame which you get whenever
17:14 - you create a new window builder project
17:17 - right you can drag and drop these pallet
17:21 - tools from from this palette to the to
17:27 - this frame so for example I can drag and
17:30 - drop this J button here in order to drag
17:34 - and drop this J button I need to have
17:36 - this absolute layout so this all I will
17:40 - show in the next video but let's see
17:44 - what can we do with this so for now I'm
17:48 - just going to run the blank frame here
17:52 - and in the later video I will show you
17:54 - how you can design this frame with J
17:58 - button or jtextfield or J radio button
18:01 - or other tools which are there in this
18:04 - palette so what I'm going to do is I
18:07 - will just run this and you will be able
18:10 - to see this frame which is blank right
18:13 - now but when we design our frame with
18:16 - some buttons or menus and all the other
18:19 - things this will look really interactive
18:23 - and you will be able to design your GUI
18:27 - with this window builder now in this
18:30 - video I'm going to show you how you can
18:32 - write your first program using a GUI
18:36 - plugin or Java builder and we are going
18:39 - to make our first project in which we
18:42 - are going to make the Java GUI using
18:46 - window builder plugin so let's get
18:49 - started just fire up your Eclipse IDE
18:53 - and we already have installed will
18:56 - no builder so when you go to file here
19:00 - and choose new new option here first of
19:05 - all what you need to do is you need to
19:08 - create a new project for building your
19:11 - application so what you need to do file
19:14 - new and just say new Java project this
19:19 - one and in here you need to give the
19:22 - name for your project okay so for
19:26 - example I am going to give the name Java
19:32 - GUI demo for example okay and then all
19:40 - the settings will remain the same I will
19:44 - click Next and everything is okay I will
19:50 - click once again finish so it has
19:53 - created a new project for me which is
19:56 - Java GUI demo and there is nothing much
20:00 - in this project folder instead of this
20:03 - subfolder called source and there is no
20:06 - file inside this subfolder so we are
20:09 - going to add a project file or Java file
20:14 - in here to make our GUI
20:17 - so go to your project which you have
20:19 - created and go to this source folder
20:22 - subfolder there and right click this
20:25 - source folder and go to new and go to
20:31 - others or other this is the last option
20:34 - okay and in here we are searching for
20:38 - Windows builder which we have installed
20:40 - in the last video so just search for
20:43 - this option called window builder and
20:46 - then this with the window builder we are
20:49 - searching for swing designer and we want
20:52 - to select application window from here
20:55 - ok so just select in windowbuilder swing
20:59 - designer application window this one
21:01 - click Next and now you need to give the
21:05 - name to your class for that
21:09 - new window so I will name it as for
21:14 - example frame 1 ok and I will click
21:22 - finish and this will create me this
21:27 - frame 1 dot Java class and in here it
21:33 - you can see already some of the code
21:36 - which is generated by Eclipse for you ok
21:39 - and when you click this you have this
21:42 - design view of your project so there is
21:45 - a source view of your project and the
21:47 - design you project and in this design
21:50 - view you can design your frame whatever
21:53 - application you are working on and in
21:55 - the source view or its source code you
21:59 - need to write the the code behind your
22:03 - GUI ok
22:05 - so we will start with this design you
22:09 - one thing you will notice that it's a
22:12 - very small area you are working on and
22:17 - to increase this area so that you can
22:21 - easily see this whole frame and other
22:26 - things you just need to go here at the
22:29 - top where your frame 1 that Java tab is
22:33 - there just go there and double click it
22:36 - so click this 2 times double click it
22:39 - and we increase your area and it will
22:43 - hide all the project wizard here and
22:47 - last wizard here ok and when you want to
22:50 - go to once again to the last view view
22:53 - you just double click it once again ok
22:56 - double click it will maximize and double
22:59 - click it will come to its real state
23:02 - ok so double click this and now we can
23:05 - see this frame much easily ok now to add
23:12 - a component in this frame there is this
23:17 - wizard or this palette called tool
23:21 - palette or and in
23:23 - here you have different tools to add
23:27 - into your frame okay so you have some
23:30 - button radio button and different panels
23:32 - split panels and different kind of tools
23:35 - which you can use to make your GUI
23:37 - application right so first of all we
23:42 - need to add a layout to our frame so
23:46 - there are different type of layout but
23:49 - for the first video tutorial I'm going
23:52 - to use this absolute layout which is
23:54 - really easy to work with okay so I will
23:58 - just click this once you just need to
24:01 - click this you don't need to drag to
24:04 - your frame you just click it and just
24:08 - move your mouse on your frame okay so
24:12 - click and move your mouse on your frame
24:14 - and just click it once again and then
24:17 - this layout will be added to your frame
24:20 - this is a layout so you will not see any
24:24 - change because it's a layout in your
24:27 - frame so it will not be directly visible
24:31 - okay so just click this and add it here
24:35 - right in the same way for example I want
24:38 - to add a button to my layout which I
24:41 - have just added which is absolute layout
24:43 - I will click this J button from here
24:46 - just click it and then move your mouse
24:49 - to your frame okay and just click it
24:53 - once again and really leave it okay and
24:56 - when you leave it here you can add it
25:02 - your content or you can edit the text of
25:06 - this button directly from here or you
25:09 - can what you can do here you can
25:11 - right-click and you can do some of the
25:15 - things from here also auto size and the
25:19 - things like action perform this is very
25:22 - important
25:23 - yeah and otherwise what you can do is
25:26 - you can select your tool or component
25:28 - and you can go to the properties of that
25:31 - component and these are the property you
25:34 - can change for this
25:36 - opponent so there are different
25:39 - properties for this component and one of
25:41 - the property is this text property and
25:45 - you can see in front of text property
25:48 - the text is new button and this is the
25:51 - text on your button so you can change
25:53 - this text by just going to this text
25:57 - property and you can add your text there
26:02 - so I can add for example show message
26:10 - okay so I want to show some message when
26:15 - I click this button okay and there are
26:18 - some other properties which you can use
26:21 - for example you can change the font for
26:27 - example if you want just click this font
26:30 - button here there's three dots button
26:33 - and you can make it bold and you can
26:36 - make or increase the size of this text
26:39 - okay and you can even use different font
26:44 - family with your button and click OK and
26:47 - then you will be able to see the change
26:49 - immediately on your button okay you can
26:54 - also change the background you can just
26:57 - click this and there are different
26:59 - background for this button and there are
27:03 - different color spring colors named
27:06 - colors so you can do many things with
27:10 - this background okay and there is
27:13 - something called foreground so
27:15 - background will change the background of
27:17 - this button so for example I want to
27:20 - have the green background light green or
27:24 - this light green background and I will
27:27 - click OK
27:28 - and this will change the background
27:30 - right and I want to change the fall
27:34 - foreground of this I can do it also by
27:37 - going to the foreground property and I
27:40 - can choose the foreground for example
27:45 - a little bit dark okay
27:48 - for example I choose this as a
27:51 - foreground and when I do this this text
27:55 - you will see the color of this text is
27:58 - change okay so in this way you can play
28:01 - with the properties there are many
28:03 - properties you can clear it and you will
28:07 - be able to change the property of your
28:10 - tool or your component okay now then
28:16 - what you need to do is for example you
28:18 - want to perform some action when you
28:21 - click this button so you need to write
28:24 - some code for that okay so for example I
28:27 - want to show some message when I click
28:30 - this button how can I do it I will just
28:33 - right click my button and I will say add
28:37 - event handler okay add here event
28:40 - handler and the first event handler this
28:43 - is a very basic event handler for every
28:45 - component which is action performed and
28:48 - this indicates to the basic action
28:51 - performed by the component so you can
28:54 - just go to action and just click action
28:58 - perform when you click this action
29:00 - perform you will reach to the
29:02 - code-behind or source for this button
29:06 - action performed here so you will see
29:09 - this here public void actionperformed
29:13 - right and in here in this method inside
29:20 - this action perform of this button what
29:23 - you can do you can write the code to
29:26 - perform some action so for example I
29:29 - want to show some message when I click
29:31 - this button I will go to the design view
29:33 - once again and you can what you need to
29:39 - do in order to go to the source code for
29:42 - this button but next in perform one you
29:46 - can do this one action perform or add
29:49 - handler and action perform from here or
29:51 - otherwise you can directly double click
29:54 - this button for action perform just
29:57 - double click it and you will be
29:58 - - the same code here for example I want
30:01 - to show some message so I can write J
30:08 - option pain dot show so you can see some
30:15 - intelligence text come here so what ever
30:18 - so this Eclipse IDE supports
30:23 - intelligence and by the use of this
30:27 - intelligence you will be presented some
30:29 - of the possible options which you can
30:32 - use it with your code okay so I will say
30:36 - show message I want to show some message
30:40 - so I will just write and double click it
30:42 - and you will also see the my name when
30:48 - you hover over this method you will be
30:50 - able to see some help in here which you
30:54 - can see and you can read about this what
30:57 - this code do okay so I want to show some
31:03 - message so the first argument for this
31:06 - will be null and the second argument
31:09 - will be with the message which you want
31:11 - to show so in the double quotes I can
31:14 - give my message so for example I can say
31:19 - hi YouTube
31:26 - or something something else or whatever
31:30 - message you want to show so I want to
31:32 - show hi YouTube okay
31:33 - and once again I can go to the design
31:38 - view or I can go to the source view from
31:42 - here and here also and I just will run
31:46 - this code from here so when I click this
31:48 - green button here that will give me the
31:52 - resource or save the changes so it will
31:56 - ask me do you really want to save the
31:58 - changes and then it will compile your
32:01 - program so yes I want to save the tin so
32:03 - I will say select this frame 1 dot Java
32:09 - file and click OK it will save my
32:12 - changes and will show me this message
32:15 - here right and not the message but the
32:20 - frame yes which is called jframe and you
32:24 - can see the background of this button is
32:26 - green and foreground is a little bit
32:29 - dark okay when I click this button I
32:31 - want to see the message which I have
32:33 - written hi YouTube I will click this
32:36 - button and you can see the message here
32:38 - hi you do ok once again so you will be
32:44 - able to see the messages like this ok so
32:49 - background color I really don't I mean I
32:55 - don't really use this background color I
32:59 - like the inherent color of these
33:01 - component which is this this inherent
33:05 - color here so the second thing for
33:08 - example I want to add a text box so what
33:13 - you need to do take take a text box from
33:18 - here and click this jtextfield and just
33:24 - move your mouse to the frame and just
33:27 - click it once again
33:29 - and it says some error so I will remove
33:35 - this text box for now let's go giving me
33:40 - some error so let's remove this text box
33:44 - for now okay once again I will reach to
33:50 - the message box so for example I will
33:54 - take a jlabel if I can find it
34:00 - is there any J labels here okay list
34:05 - editor so you need to find your
34:11 - components from here so here it is J
34:18 - label so I can just click the syllable
34:21 - and drag and drop to my J frame and I
34:25 - can change the text of this J label from
34:29 - here also or from here also okay so new
34:32 - label I can change the text
34:38 - message okay I will show message it
34:41 - right or I can change the variable name
34:46 - for this so when you are using a bunch
34:52 - of different labels here and you want to
34:55 - know which label is performing what you
34:58 - need to change this variable name from
35:01 - here in order to you know know what this
35:06 - label is doing so you can just write
35:09 - label and this is a variable name by
35:12 - which you will recognize your label or
35:16 - any components you can change the
35:18 - variable name from here
35:19 - so I will say label message okay so - it
35:28 - has changed the name of this label and
35:32 - then I can just double click this and
35:36 - instead of using or showing the message
35:39 - from this j option pin what I can do I
35:43 - can show the message in the label also
35:45 - so I will say the name of the label is
35:50 - so if you can see here the name of the
35:52 - label is I have changed it to LBL
35:56 - message this is just copy this and in
36:00 - this button action perform just paste it
36:04 - and then write dot so what was the name
36:11 - of my label the name of my label and I
36:15 - can say
36:18 - and shouldn't not showing anything let's
36:21 - see why so I found out what the problem
36:26 - is when I dragged and dropped this label
36:29 - in here in my frame and when I have seen
36:34 - this label its code is generated locally
36:38 - here so you see a jape label and then
36:42 - the Declaration of my label name or
36:46 - variable so what I need to do here is I
36:49 - need to copy this J label and the name
36:54 - of the label and at the top at the very
36:58 - top of my class
37:00 - just after wherever you see private J
37:04 - frame frame just below that just write
37:08 - the Declaration of the label also so
37:11 - just check whether it's already there if
37:14 - it's already there then it's okay
37:16 - otherwise we have to do it manually okay
37:20 - so just you need to just forward declare
37:25 - your label name as a global variable
37:28 - here and in here you just need to remove
37:32 - this J label from here okay
37:36 - so wherever your jail label declaration
37:39 - if there you just need to remove it and
37:41 - then this makes this label as a global
37:45 - variable and it can be called from other
37:48 - functions also okay so this is why we
37:53 - have done this because whenever we have
37:56 - dragged and dropped this label in here
37:58 - its code was generated locally by
38:01 - eclipse and we wanted to use this label
38:04 - in other in other functions also okay
38:09 - this this label name so what we have
38:12 - done we have changed the Declaration of
38:14 - this label as private J label the name
38:18 - of the label which you have given it and
38:20 - we have removed the Declaration of this
38:24 - J label here and just we use the name
38:26 - Jeb label is equal to you
38:28 - and this makes your the label global and
38:32 - then you can go to design once again
38:35 - double-click your show message once
38:38 - again make it bigger show message once
38:42 - again and in this action perform of this
38:45 - public void actionperformed you can use
38:48 - this label message dot set text and I
38:57 - can set any text to this label so for
39:00 - example I want to just set the same text
39:02 - to the label also I can do it like this
39:07 - ok so label dot set text and I will just
39:11 - save my program and I can run this and
39:16 - when I click this show message now this
39:20 - label is showing hello and we it's not
39:25 - showing the full YouTube because we need
39:28 - to resize our label from here I can
39:31 - resize my label like this ok and now the
39:37 - size of label is bigger and now when I
39:40 - run the program once again it will show
39:44 - the whole message
39:45 - hi YouTube here right so this is how you
39:51 - can create your first project using
39:54 - window builder in Eclipse IDE now in
39:58 - this video we will make some useful
40:01 - application a simple calculator to add
40:04 - or subtract two values which we enter in
40:07 - the text box so let's get started I have
40:10 - this blank frame here and I have taken
40:15 - this absolute layout inside this frame
40:19 - and then I'm going to take two text
40:22 - boxes here text box 1 and text box
40:28 - - once again Xbox - ok so I have these
40:35 - two text boxes first in the first text
40:38 - box name is text box feeling the I will
40:42 - name it as text box filled num1 and the
40:47 - second text box name I will change it as
40:50 - text box filled num2 okay so in these
40:58 - two text boxes we are going to enter our
41:01 - two number which we want to add or
41:04 - subtract okay now I will take - or I
41:11 - will take button or two buttons one for
41:17 - adding so I will take this button one
41:21 - for adding and one for subtracting for
41:25 - example
41:30 - if you have observed when you want to
41:32 - [Music]
41:34 - drag-and-drop or when you want to take a
41:37 - same tool two times you need to just
41:41 - click on some other component and go on
41:43 - the same component once again and yet
41:46 - then you will be able to drag and drop
41:47 - the second the same component once again
41:51 - so in this text box I will change or in
41:56 - this button I will change the text of
41:58 - this button as ad and the second text
42:06 - box text as
42:15 - - for example okay and then what I can
42:21 - do is I want to show the answer
42:25 - somewhere right so I can show it this
42:27 - answer in a label or a text box whatever
42:31 - you want so for example I want to show
42:34 - the answer in the text box here okay and
42:39 - for I will take this label to show that
42:43 - this is my answer so I will drag and
42:47 - drop this label and I will just move
42:51 - this and this label the text of this
42:55 - label is the
43:04 - on sir is for example and the answer
43:07 - will be shown in this text box okay and
43:12 - you can change the property of this
43:15 - label you can change the font size so I
43:18 - will give the bigger pond size and bold
43:22 - and let's see what kind of font family
43:30 - we can use any font family for example
43:35 - this time Stroman or
43:41 - okay I will take this
43:45 - and I want to make my own little bit
43:50 - bigger so now I can see this so I have
43:56 - three text boxes and two buttons one
43:59 - label which will show that what will be
44:03 - the answer in this text box okay I will
44:06 - first of all I will click this Add
44:08 - button so I can double click it or I can
44:11 - go to right click ever add event handler
44:15 - and action perform okay so this time I
44:17 - am going to double click this button and
44:20 - we reach to the action perform for this
44:25 - new button which is called add okay and
44:28 - in here first of all I will write a
44:32 - try-catch block so that user can enter
44:36 - any invalid number for example he may
44:39 - not enter a number he may enter some
44:42 - letter or word or something which is not
44:45 - valid so we need to catch that exception
44:47 - so that's why we need to use try catch
44:50 - block right so we will use a try catch
44:54 - block here and this is how you can write
44:58 - a triangle block just write try and
45:01 - these two curly braces and after these
45:04 - two curly braces you catch your
45:07 - exception if any exception occurs so you
45:09 - can catch your exception in this catch
45:11 - law and I'm simply showing some message
45:16 - in the click catch block so if our
45:20 - program throws any error while we are
45:25 - adding these two numbers I will catch
45:27 - the exception and I will say please
45:29 - enter valid numbers okay so this message
45:33 - dialog I have shown you in the last
45:34 - video how to show a message using J
45:39 - option pin right if you remember and in
45:42 - this try catch block or in this try
45:44 - block I'm going to write my code but
45:47 - above this try block what I'm going to
45:51 - do is I'm going to declare two numbers
45:55 - or
45:57 - yeah I'm going to declare two integer
45:59 - numbers so what I am going to do is I
46:05 - will declare two integer variables int
46:12 - num1 comma
46:17 - two and i will need a answer variable
46:22 - also to store the answer so i will say a
46:24 - ns
46:26 - so I have to create three variables num1
46:29 - num2 and ANS so this number one we will
46:34 - transfer the value from the first text
46:36 - box to this number one so I will say num
46:39 - 1 is equal to so num 1 is equal to and
46:46 - then whenever we take the value from the
46:51 - text box we need to convert it this
46:54 - value in to the integer right from the
46:57 - text box we are going to get the value
47:00 - as a txt and we need to convert this
47:02 - value in the integer so how you can
47:04 - convert this text to integer you need to
47:07 - pass it so you can just write integer
47:12 - dot parse int and this can take a string
47:20 - so what you get from the first text box
47:23 - you can transfer it inside this pass it
47:27 - as an argument
47:28 - so our first text box name is let's see
47:31 - what is the name of our first text box
47:34 - text feel numb 1 right go to the source
47:38 - code and inside this parts and argument
47:42 - I can write text feel numb 1 dot get
47:47 - text right because we are getting the
47:51 - text okay in a same way we will transfer
47:56 - the value from the second text box text
47:59 - box feel enum to to the num2 variable
48:05 - write integer the parseint and this will
48:08 - be X field
48:10 - num2 okay now once we have our values
48:15 - from the textbooks in these two
48:16 - variables we can add these two numbers
48:19 - so we can write answer is equal to num1
48:28 - plus num2 right and we can show this
48:36 - answer to the third text box which was
48:40 - this text box this text box right so we
48:45 - can say the text box field I will change
48:49 - the text box field variable name as a NS
48:54 - text well peel ans so we know that it's
48:57 - answer text field and then in our code
49:02 - what we can write we can take the name
49:06 - of this text field a and s dot set text
49:13 - read text and we are going to set this
49:18 - number in this field right so what we
49:22 - are going to do is we can just transfer
49:25 - our answer which is this one a and s
49:28 - answer variable to the argument or set
49:32 - text right so as an argument or read
49:36 - text in here
49:40 - and this will show this error because
49:44 - it's not our text right
49:46 - it's our integer and we need to convert
49:49 - this text to this integer to text right
49:54 - so to convert this integer to text what
49:58 - we need to do here in the text box
50:01 - filled answer God set text first we need
50:04 - to convert this answer to text field so
50:07 - we will do it like this this is an
50:10 - integer so we will write integer dot to
50:15 - string that's right to string and this
50:22 - will take this answer integer okay as an
50:25 - argument here like this so our code for
50:31 - addition will look like this this is our
50:34 - code first we have taken the value from
50:37 - the first text box to the number one
50:39 - variable same we have done for number
50:42 - two variable we added these two variable
50:44 - and transfer the value to the text box
50:47 - as an answer same we will do for the
50:51 - subtraction button which is minus button
50:54 - right double-click this and in this
50:58 - extra actionperformed of this button I
51:01 - will just copy this code which I have
51:05 - written in the last action perform of
51:07 - this add button and paste it into the
51:12 - action perform of minus button and the
51:15 - only change will be this this will be
51:18 - now - right and then it will
51:28 - the only thing you may need to consider
51:31 - is this exception II it's showing
51:35 - duplicate parameter e you can name it as
51:39 - e 1 so that this e and this e doesn't
51:43 - clashes ok now we are going to run our
51:46 - program compile it and run it and
51:49 - hopefully it will not give any error
51:51 - okay so it's not giving any error and
51:54 - for example I want to add 5 5 5 & 6 6 6
52:00 - not this one but 6 6 6
52:02 - right and I want to add them the answer
52:07 - is 1 2 2 1 right for example I want to
52:12 - subtract them the answer is minus 1 1 1
52:15 - right I can do it some other values or I
52:20 - can just give some value which is not
52:25 - integer for example some word or some
52:28 - letter and let's click this answer
52:30 - button it shows please enter valid
52:33 - number because we have added this try
52:36 - catch block and this is catching any
52:39 - error if we if the user enters any
52:43 - invalid number ok so this is how you can
52:47 - create a simple calculator using your
52:52 - window builder in Eclipse now I want to
52:55 - build from this video a small little
52:58 - project so that it I'm going to build
53:01 - this project and and I'm going to teach
53:05 - I'm going to try to teach every tool or
53:10 - component we have in here by building
53:14 - that project so in a way you will build
53:16 - a project also and you will learn how to
53:21 - use these components or tools also so
53:25 - from this video I am going to create
53:31 - connection to the database with this
53:35 - java application so I'm going to use
53:38 - SQLite jar that
53:40 - base for a connection to this GUI which
53:44 - we are making in Java and we are going
53:47 - to make a little login page in
53:53 - connection with this database but first
53:55 - of all I want to show you how you can
53:57 - create your database in SQLite SQLite is
54:00 - a server less database that means you
54:03 - can transfer this database from one
54:05 - computer to another without worrying for
54:08 - the connection to the server so it's not
54:11 - server based database it's a kind of
54:14 - local database which exists on one
54:17 - computer only ok so let me show you how
54:22 - you can first of all create a database I
54:25 - will show you the simple method there
54:28 - can be other method for creating SQLite
54:31 - database but what I find simple I'm
54:36 - going to show you but if you don't know
54:40 - about SQLite how to use SQLite what you
54:46 - can do is you can go to my channel which
54:51 - is YouTube / programming knowledge
55:04 - and you can find their SQLite tutorial
55:08 - if you are really new to SQLite database
55:12 - you can find those tutorials here so go
55:16 - to my channel which is programming
55:18 - knowledge and go to playlist and in here
55:21 - you will be able to find this playlist
55:23 - in here so this playlist is called
55:28 - SQLite database so this is the playlist
55:34 - which I'm talking about beginners as
55:36 - like tutorial and in here I have
55:39 - explained how you can create database
55:41 - query to the database and some of the
55:44 - basics of SQLite but in this video also
55:48 - I'm going to show you how you can easily
55:50 - make SQLite database in your computer so
55:55 - the easiest thing is to use Firefox as a
56:00 - SQLite manager so if you don't have
56:02 - Firefox just download this Firefox from
56:06 - Internet it's free if as you all know
56:09 - and in here in the Firefox I have the
56:14 - newest version of Firefox which is
56:16 - Firefox I think 31 so open your Firefox
56:19 - and click this small button here and in
56:24 - here you will find this different
56:28 - section what we are interested in is
56:30 - add-ons so click this add-ons here and
56:33 - search for the add-on call SQLite and
56:39 - press Enter and you will find this
56:42 - SQLite manager 0.8.1 it's free so just
56:46 - click install and will be installed in
56:51 - your Firefox browser as plug-in just
56:57 - restart your Firefox so I will once
57:00 - again restart my Firefox and now how to
57:05 - search for that SQLite manager in
57:09 - Firefox so in the older version the it
57:13 - was really easier to find this
57:15 - manager by going to the top menu but in
57:18 - this new Firefox you need to go to
57:22 - customize so just click this customize
57:25 - here and in here you will be able to
57:28 - find your ex collide manager right so
57:31 - just drag and drop this SQLite manager
57:34 - in this menu in here ok and you will be
57:39 - good to go and just exit customization
57:43 - and now you will be able to see SQLite
57:45 - manager here just open this SQLite
57:48 - manager and we are ready to create our
57:50 - SQLite database it's really simple to
57:53 - make SQLite database in this SQLite
57:56 - manager to create a new database you can
57:58 - go here and say new database and give
58:02 - the name of the database for example I
58:04 - want to create a database for employees
58:06 - so I will say employee what we can say
58:14 - employee dot r dot abase ok and this
58:20 - will create an extension dot SQLite it
58:23 - will automatically give an extension to
58:25 - your database AZ dot SQLite but it's not
58:28 - necessary that all SQLite database have
58:31 - the same extension they can have dot DB
58:33 - extension also other extension also but
58:37 - SQLite Manager in Firefox create the
58:40 - extension dot s collide so don't worry
58:42 - about it and click OK and now it will
58:47 - ask for the location where you want to
58:49 - save your database ok so save a location
58:54 - which you can locate later right so for
58:58 - example let's say where can I save my
59:02 - database I will go to user and I will go
59:09 - to the same workspace which I am using
59:13 - for this Eclipse ok you can save it
59:19 - anywhere it's not I mean it's not
59:23 - necessary that you need to save it in
59:26 - the specified folder you can choose any
59:29 - folder of your choice and you select
59:31 - that folder and then this SQLite
59:35 - database will be created there ok now in
59:39 - order to add tables you need to
59:42 - right-click right now whenever you
59:45 - create this database it has 0 tables so
59:49 - you need to add tables so just right
59:51 - click this tables
59:52 - yeah and click create table and in here
59:55 - you can give create a table so for
59:58 - example I name my table as employee info
60:07 - table and here I can make the column
60:11 - names so the basics you can find on my
60:14 - playlist of my channel but I will
60:16 - quickly create these columns first
60:20 - column will be e ID second column will
60:24 - be name name third column will be so
60:32 - named both will be
60:40 - user name v Billy
60:46 - password and for example sixth will be
60:52 - age for now I need these columns maybe I
60:56 - will add more columns but for now it's
60:58 - okay
60:59 - EW will be integer data type and name
61:04 - will be text and surname will be text
61:10 - username will be text and password will
61:14 - be text and my age will be integer
61:18 - okay so I have quickly created this
61:21 - database and for example I say e ID is
61:25 - my primary key I will click OK and click
61:29 - yes so now I have one table created in
61:33 - the SQLite Manager and in this table I
61:36 - can add some data okay so how to add
61:40 - data you can just make it bigger and
61:45 - just go to the table and go to browse
61:48 - and search here and to add some data you
61:52 - can just go to add and for example
61:55 - employee ID one name is mark some
62:04 - surname username for example one you can
62:07 - give any username password also one for
62:10 - example and it is 35 for example okay
62:16 - okay so I have created added one
62:18 - daughter I will once again add the
62:21 - second data this is John
62:31 - some surname and user name - password -
62:38 - age 25 so I have two rows of data I have
62:45 - created and this is your database and
62:47 - what is so once you create your database
62:50 - and wherever you have given the location
62:53 - for saving this database you will find
62:55 - this database there so I will look for
62:58 - this database once again where I have
63:01 - saved I have saved it in workspace you
63:04 - can see employee dot SQLite database
63:06 - here right so this is the database I
63:10 - have created and it has some data okay
63:13 - now I can close this Firefox browser and
63:19 - I will create a new project they say I
63:22 - have been showing in you in the last two
63:25 - videos but I will create a new project
63:27 - for this okay so what I'm going to do is
63:30 - close this for now I will go to file new
63:34 - new project and I will name this project
63:38 - as company project okay and everything
63:47 - will remain safe same I will click Next
63:51 - and I will click finish so it has
63:54 - created me a project called company it
63:58 - has subfolder called sauce and some
64:01 - libraries okay in this I'm going to add
64:05 - a class so go just go to the source
64:09 - folder right click it and go to new and
64:13 - I'm going to add a class and this class
64:16 - I will call as SQLite
64:25 - connection glass so this class will help
64:29 - us to connect to the database and make
64:33 - sure this is not checked public static
64:35 - void main is not checked its unchecked
64:39 - okay
64:40 - so this method made this class will not
64:42 - contain the mean method okay this is our
64:45 - helper class and just click finish now
64:55 - you have this escalate connection class
64:58 - it doesn't have anything other than the
65:00 - class name so what we are going to do is
65:03 - in here we are we want to import some of
65:06 - the imports to connect to the database
65:08 - first import is import Java dot SQL dot
65:22 - star or asterisk whenever you use this s
65:26 - trick it this means that you this will
65:30 - be SQL right so whenever you use this
65:35 - asterisk after dot it means whatever
65:38 - class this SQL namespace or whatever
65:42 - have it will add all the classes related
65:46 - to X SQL okay and the second import is
65:51 - import Java X dot swing
66:02 - okay so we have created a to imports now
66:08 - I will create a method which will be a
66:11 - public method public static and this
66:20 - method will return the connection so I
66:22 - will say connection and the name of the
66:28 - method will be for example DB DB
66:38 - connector okay and this will take no
66:42 - argument and this will take we will
66:49 - start the method and and the matter like
66:52 - this so let's create global variable
66:58 - maybe we use this in future so just
67:01 - write connection gon is equal to null
67:06 - and do it like this
67:11 - and so this connection is a part of your
67:16 - java dot SQL class you see when you
67:19 - hover over this this is a part of your
67:22 - java dot SQL dot connection lost right
67:25 - that's why I have used this and this
67:28 - method will return the connection and
67:31 - first of all in the last video I've
67:33 - shown you how to create try catch block
67:35 - so just make a quick try catch block by
67:43 - catch and it will take exceptions so
67:51 - that's right
67:54 - exception II and if any exception occurs
67:59 - I will show it in option pain dot show
68:11 - dialogue or show message dialog right
68:14 - dot show message dialog okay and now I
68:23 - will just pass null here as a first
68:26 - argument and the second argument I will
68:29 - pass as the exception message so I will
68:32 - pass this II itself here okay so in this
68:37 - tribe block what we need to do is first
68:40 - of all we need to define the class for
68:44 - connection to the SQLite so we would
68:46 - write class dot for for name and this
68:55 - will be in the double quotes this will
68:59 - be orgy dot s collide dot JDBC in
69:10 - capital okay and don't forget to give
69:15 - the semicolon here so this will be like
69:18 - this Oh RG dot s collide dot capital
69:23 - JDBC and this is showing error right now
69:26 - because we are not returning anything
69:28 - but once we return the connection will
69:31 - not show this error so first of all
69:33 - let's create the connection so
69:37 - connection con is equal to write driver
69:47 - manager dot get connection
69:51 - and this will be the connection so in
69:55 - this double quotes as an argument you
69:59 - will run je d bc j d bc and then :
70:06 - SQLite because we are using SQLite SQL
70:09 - ite : and now you will give the pack of
70:14 - your database where your database is
70:18 - present so my database is present and
70:21 - this part so I will copy this path or
70:23 - what I can do I will right-click on my
70:26 - database for through the property
70:28 - security and I will copy all the path
70:31 - from here ok copy all the path and I
70:37 - will paste it here ok and it will show
70:42 - error because I will show you why it
70:45 - will show error but first of all I need
70:49 - to add the name of this database also
70:53 - this database name is employee dot
70:57 - SQLite so slash back slash employ what
71:07 - is it doing ok so it should have this
71:11 - database name employee data or SQLite
71:15 - I will right
71:20 - employee data dot SQL ite
71:25 - okay so first of all it's showing this
71:29 - error when you when you write this
71:33 - because you need to add whenever you
71:36 - make your part or whenever you give your
71:39 - part in Windows you need to give double
71:43 - slashes everywhere yeah instead of
71:47 - single slash as a path okay
71:50 - and just end this like this now it will
71:54 - not give any error okay and once you
71:59 - have your connection you will return
72:01 - your connection just write return corner
72:09 - and as soon as you return something here
72:13 - you will be able to see that this error
72:18 - will go so in here also we will return
72:23 - null it on and now the error will go
72:32 - okay
72:33 - so this is the connection class which we
72:37 - will use to connect to the database okay
72:42 - now once we have this connection class
72:45 - we are ready to make the login form
72:49 - right so what I'm going to do is I will
72:51 - go to my project once again go to the
72:54 - subfolder called source right click it
72:57 - go to new and go to other and then I
73:02 - will choose window builder and in SQLite
73:05 - design and I will choose application
73:07 - window click Next and now I want to give
73:11 - the path or the name of the new class
73:15 - I'm going to make so this will be my
73:17 - login login class so I will name it as
73:21 - login ok and I will finish
73:26 - and now you will be able to see this
73:30 - class which is created for us right so
73:36 - we go to the designer and for this video
73:42 - we will not do much but we will just
73:47 - check the connection with the database
73:49 - okay so we will leave this as a blank
73:53 - but we will go to the source and we will
73:56 - go to the source at the top of this in
73:59 - login dot Java class and in here I will
74:05 - find the constructor for this login
74:09 - class which is public login and it
74:13 - already has this method which is
74:16 - generated by eclipse which is initialize
74:18 - method and just below this initialize
74:21 - method what I'm going to do is I want to
74:26 - call that class connection Java
74:29 - connection class here to check my
74:33 - connection so what I am going to do is I
74:35 - will just go at the top one you can do
74:39 - it here also but it's better to do just
74:43 - after this declaration of the frame but
74:45 - yeah you can do it just above this
74:48 - constructor which how you can find the
74:51 - constructor it has the same name as your
74:53 - class okay just find the same name as
74:57 - class and initialize method it has
74:59 - initialized method and just above that I
75:02 - will call this class okay so what I'm
75:08 - going to do is here also first of all I
75:11 - need to add those import which I have
75:15 - used in SQLite connection class so I
75:20 - will just copy these two imports which
75:22 - is import Java dot SQL and import Java X
75:26 - dot s swing right and I will paste these
75:30 - two connections here okay
75:32 - and now in above your constructor you
75:35 - can write
75:38 - connection connection corn is equal to
75:45 - null and then we will make our results
75:50 - set or we will make it later and this
75:54 - connection corn we are going to use
75:57 - globally so just use this one variable
76:01 - or I will make it as a more clear
76:09 - connection so you know that this is a
76:13 - connection to the database okay just
76:15 - call this connection so just copy this
76:18 - object from here and just ride is equal
76:21 - to and just copy the name of the class
76:24 - which is SQLite connection class write
76:28 - the name of the class dot all method
76:33 - which is DB connector method okay so
76:37 - this DB connector is this method if you
76:40 - can see here this DV connector is this
76:44 - connection and we can show some message
76:48 - here with before returning so that we
76:53 - know that our connection is successful
76:55 - so just below this connection in SQLite
76:59 - connection dot database just above
77:02 - return connection you can show this
77:04 - message that our connection is
77:06 - successful so I can write connection
77:16 - successful okay so what I have done in
77:20 - the log in class I have just called this
77:22 - connection class from Java dot SQLite
77:26 - class and I have in the constructor of
77:29 - this login class I have just called this
77:31 - connection is equal to the class which
77:34 - is SQLite connection dot the method in
77:37 - which I have connected to the database
77:40 - let's try to run the program it if it
77:43 - works or not
77:44 - I was right-click and let's see if we
77:48 - can make this project as our main
77:50 - project or we can when we run it we will
77:53 - be able to choose this so we have this
77:57 - here login and connection click OK
78:04 - and it's saying the message Java not
78:08 - long last not found exception o RG dot X
78:13 - collide or JDBC let's see what if the
78:16 - error okay so I will just close this
78:21 - file and I will find the error and then
78:25 - come back so I found out the error the
78:30 - error is I haven't added this SQLite
78:33 - ODBC or JDBC jar file to my project to
78:38 - use this SQLite database to connect to
78:42 - our project with Java we need to add
78:45 - some jar
78:47 - to our project so that we can connect
78:51 - SQLite to the Java so to download this
78:55 - SQLite JDBC jar file I will put this
79:01 - link in the description which is HTTP
79:05 - colon slash slash best bit bucket dot
79:09 - o-r-g /x irreal /s collide JDBC ok so I
79:18 - will put this link in the description
79:19 - then you will be able to download this
79:22 - file and in here you know it need to go
79:25 - to download and in here you need to
79:31 - download repository so just click this
79:34 - button download the posit 3 and will
79:37 - download a folder like this so I will
79:41 - open this folder and in this folder you
79:45 - will have some charge so I will go to
79:49 - limb and in here will search for these
79:56 - jar SQLite and yeah
80:00 - include windows I will search for these
80:04 - jars now
80:06 - so I think I downloaded the wrong
80:10 - repository this is the repository but I
80:14 - don't find any jar file there so I will
80:17 - one by one download all the jar files so
80:22 - first of all this one and I will keep it
80:28 - second one and the third one I will keep
80:33 - it all keep and fourth one keep it if
80:44 - one
80:50 - and downloaded
80:54 - and sixth one
80:59 - and the seventh one
81:04 - so I will all download all these jar
81:09 - files and once I have these downloads
81:13 - I'll go to the folder where I have
81:16 - downloaded them so in the folder so
81:19 - these are all the downloads for the jar
81:22 - file I have here now in order to add
81:24 - these jar file in your project what you
81:27 - need to do is go to your Eclipse project
81:31 - in here so go to your project here and
81:36 - you will have this JRE system library
81:42 - automatically created by eclipse for you
81:44 - in your project so search for this JRE
81:48 - system library right click it and go to
81:52 - build path and in Bill park go to
81:55 - configure build path okay so once again
81:59 - go to this JRE system library right
82:01 - click build path
82:03 - configure build path and in here you can
82:07 - add these jar files in your libraries so
82:13 - to add those SQLite jar file just click
82:16 - this Add jar button and then you can
82:21 - browse for your jar files I think in
82:28 - here there is no Jenner file so I what I
82:31 - need to do is first of all I will just I
82:36 - will make new folder
82:42 - so what I have done I'm in source or in
82:46 - company itself in the project I will
82:50 - right-click in my project and I will
82:51 - create new folder and in here I will
82:57 - create a folder name for example
83:07 - it's sources okay and I will finish so I
83:11 - have this folder here so what I can do
83:15 - is wherever my downloads are I can just
83:19 - select those downloads and let's see we
83:23 - can drag and drop these in our folder or
83:26 - not drag these files in this folder copy
83:32 - files okay and now I have all these file
83:37 - of jar files here now I will go to this
83:41 - GRE once again Gary system library right
83:44 - click build path configure build pot add
83:50 - jar in the libraries add jar and in
83:55 - company I have this folder resources and
83:58 - I can
84:00 - I think multi select them and click OK
84:03 - and once I have done that let me see if
84:08 - they are there or not so once I have
84:12 - done that I think they will be added in
84:15 - here these files you see so I will click
84:20 - OK and now these files are here they so
84:27 - referenced libraries ok so you will be
84:31 - able to see them here now once you have
84:34 - all these SQLite - JDBC file I will run
84:39 - my program once again and let's see what
84:42 - happens and now I can see connection
84:46 - successful and when I see connection
84:48 - successful message I know that I have
84:51 - successfully connected to my database so
84:54 - don't forget to add these SQLite JDBC
84:58 - jar file and I will provide the link for
85:02 - them so you can download all the jar
85:06 - files from that link and just add like I
85:12 - have done and this message you were
85:15 - seeing when I
85:16 - than the program connection successful
85:18 - here if the connection if you see this
85:21 - line which I have created connection
85:24 - successful that means you are connected
85:26 - to the database okay once again
85:29 - connection successful so in this way you
85:32 - can create a SQLite database and connect
85:35 - it to our Java GUI project hello guys
85:39 - welcome once again in the last video I
85:41 - have shown you how you can create your
85:44 - SQLite database and connect it to your
85:48 - Java GUI application so I have shown you
85:52 - how to create a database and how to
85:54 - connect this database to your Eclipse
85:59 - web builder GUI application right so we
86:05 - have tested our connection like this so
86:08 - whenever we run the program it shows
86:11 - connection successful that means the
86:13 - connection with the database is
86:15 - successful okay and it opens the login
86:18 - page but in this login frame we haven't
86:23 - I mean we haven't inserted any tools or
86:27 - components here so in this video I'm
86:30 - going to show you how you can create a
86:32 - login page with checks the username and
86:36 - and password from the database so it
86:40 - validates username and password from the
86:42 - database and if there's that username
86:45 - and password is correct
86:47 - then it will give you some message if
86:49 - it's correct or not so let's get started
86:53 - first of all I will just make this
86:58 - window a little bit bigger by
87:00 - double-clicking this login not Java and
87:04 - we have some space to work with now
87:07 - right so what I'm going to do is I will
87:11 - just resize this a little
87:16 - and I'm going to take this absolute
87:19 - layout and I will just place it on this
87:25 - login panel and I will take two labels
87:31 - label one and label 2 so once again
87:39 - label - okay so I have taken these two
87:45 - labels and then I will take the text box
87:50 - text box 1 and
87:58 - thanks box - okay so I have two labels
88:02 - and two text boxes and I will take a
88:06 - button which we whenever user clicks he
88:10 - will be able to login so take a button
88:15 - once again take a button here and now I
88:19 - will change the names of these labels or
88:27 - variables name I will leave these names
88:30 - for the label as it is you know how to
88:32 - change the name will be added variable
88:35 - name but I will change the text of these
88:36 - labels as first is user name it should
88:44 - be user name and the second label text
88:50 - will be why it goes to the so first
88:55 - label text will be user name and the
89:01 - second label text will be password right
89:09 - and then what I'm going to do is I
89:15 - remember one thing
89:17 - whenever you use or enter any username
89:22 - and password the password is always
89:25 - hidden it should be hidden right
89:27 - otherwise the other users can see your
89:32 - password and there is no meaning of
89:34 - password right so I will delete this
89:37 - text box because it will show my
89:40 - password to the other user and what I
89:43 - can use is this password tool so this
89:47 - there is a tool called J password field
89:50 - and this tool we specifically use for
89:53 - passwords so just click this and just
89:57 - leave it on your frame and this we use
90:00 - for entering the password okay so I will
90:04 - resize thyself yeah
90:07 - and this we will use for entering the
90:12 - password and properties of this password
90:18 - you can see here just click this
90:21 - password field and you will be able to
90:24 - see that echo care and you can change
90:27 - this echo care to any and character and
90:29 - this will be or your password will be
90:31 - maxed masked with this character so you
90:36 - can use dollar sign here or you can use
90:39 - hash or any other character and it will
90:42 - mask this character will mask all of
90:44 - your password so we have done that and I
90:52 - will change the variable name of this
90:55 - text field for username text field text
90:57 - field you and for example and for
91:02 - password this text field I will name it
91:05 - as password field so it's the name
91:08 - already suggested this the password
91:11 - field so I will not change the name of
91:12 - the field but here this I will change
91:15 - the text of this button as login and I
91:23 - will change the name of this button else
91:26 - BTN login okay so now we have this and
91:33 - maybe you can resize it so that you can
91:37 - see use an even password and you can you
91:40 - know play with the properties for this
91:42 - okay and now what I'm going to do is I
91:46 - will select this login button right
91:49 - click it add event handler action
91:53 - perform action perform and this will
91:56 - lead me to this login button action
92:00 - perform method right and inside this
92:04 - math heard I'm going to write a code to
92:07 - check the login or username and password
92:11 - right so first of all I will just make a
92:16 - try and catch block so if any error
92:19 - occurs when you catch
92:20 - the error so I will just copy the
92:22 - previous code for try-catch and I will
92:26 - paste it in action perform method and I
92:29 - will remove all the other code other
92:32 - than my try-catch blocks so I have this
92:35 - try-catch long so if any error will
92:39 - occur it will catch the any exception
92:42 - okay now in this try block first thing I
92:46 - will do is I will create a query with
92:50 - the database if you remember in the last
92:52 - video in this long in dot Java we have
92:56 - initialized our connection by our SQLite
93:00 - connection dot DB connector function so
93:03 - we have this connection with the
93:05 - database in this object which is called
93:07 - connection which we have created where
93:11 - we have created this connection let's
93:14 - see so this is the connection we have
93:16 - created right so this is an object of
93:20 - connection which is a Java dot SQL class
93:24 - connection and so if you don't recognize
93:29 - this just watch the last video once
93:32 - again okay so I'm going to use this
93:34 - connection once again but yeah now to
93:38 - the button click event or action perform
93:41 - event of this login button in this try
93:44 - block first of all what I need to do is
93:46 - I need to prepare a query which I want
93:50 - to pass to the database so I will
93:53 - prepare a query which is a string
93:56 - variable string a limit as query itself
94:04 - is equal to and in the double quotes and
94:08 - the semicolon I will write the query so
94:12 - what is the query I am going to power
94:13 - pass
94:16 - select Asterix or select as Strix means
94:20 - select all from the database table name
94:26 - so my table name here is employee info
94:29 - this I have shown you in the last video
94:31 - the table name and how to create a
94:34 - database right so selects star or s
94:37 - trick from your table name and then we
94:42 - will write a where gloss so just right
94:45 - where you are
94:48 - username so what is the name of username
94:52 - just as username and password right so
94:56 - where username username by the way
95:04 - SQLite is a non case sensitive language
95:08 - so whatever query you are passing it can
95:14 - be in uppercase or lowercase but Java is
95:16 - a case sensitive language so you cannot
95:19 - play with these objects and variables
95:23 - but yeah whenever you pass the query
95:25 - whenever you are building the query you
95:28 - can use uppercase or lowercase depending
95:30 - upon your priority so selects all from
95:35 - your table name where username is equal
95:38 - to question mark and password is equal
95:42 - to is equal to also question mark okay
95:48 - this is my query now I need to make a
95:53 - prepared statement from this query so
95:57 - what I will do I will write prepared
96:07 - statement
96:10 - if the spelling is correct I don't think
96:13 - it's correct
96:14 - let me see okay so we go further is
96:19 - equal to then what I need to do here I
96:24 - need to pass the query to the prepared
96:27 - statement right so I will make a object
96:31 - of this prepared statement I will name
96:33 - it as PST or prepared statement okay and
96:38 - then I will write connection which is my
96:42 - object which I have created in the last
96:44 - video which is connection object this
96:46 - one connection connection is equal to
96:48 - null right so prepared spit statement
96:52 - PST is equal to connection dot prepared
96:56 - statement and it takes my query you see
97:01 - here it takes the query so I'll write
97:04 - quani and this is the query I'm passing
97:07 - here so I'm passing the query to the
97:10 - prepared statement then I will prepare
97:13 - our result set but before that with this
97:17 - prepared statement I want to pass the
97:19 - values from the text boxes which the
97:22 - user will enter to the prepared
97:25 - statement
97:26 - so I will write p st dot set string this
97:34 - will be set string and this will take
97:37 - two arguments the first argument will be
97:41 - the parameter index so parameter index
97:44 - is what because we are using two
97:47 - question mark the index parameter index
97:50 - of username is zero and parameter index
97:54 - of password is one right so the index
97:57 - start from zero and whatever number of
98:01 - question mark here you have that much
98:06 - index view will have so the first
98:09 - question mark we will have the zero
98:10 - index and this and the second argument
98:15 - for this p st self string is the value
98:18 - which you are getting from the text
98:21 - boxes so go to the design view
98:24 - unable to okay so I will for now I will
98:29 - take this name which is text field un
98:35 - and I will get the text so I will write
98:39 - dot get text okay in the same way I will
98:47 - just use PSP get text for the password
98:54 - okay so PST dot set string and the index
99:00 - will be now one zero index for username
99:03 - index one for password right and the
99:08 - username or password field name is this
99:10 - one passport will not get text and as
99:15 - soon as you see here get text it will
99:19 - it's it has the line above get X that
99:23 - means it will not get text it will mask
99:26 - your password field by the mask you see
99:30 - get text from the password field is
99:34 - deprecated okay so I don't right now
99:40 - let's see I will use it as it is if it
99:45 - shows me any error I will use some other
99:48 - method for now I will use like this only
99:52 - okay so now I have these values in my
99:59 - query now I want our result set right
100:03 - so I will write result set I will name
100:08 - it as RS is equal to and then this
100:15 - result set will execute my query okay
100:19 - so what I can do PST which is my
100:22 - prepared statement this is the statement
100:24 - I have prepared dot execute query
100:28 - whatever a query I pass in that
100:30 - statement I want to execute that query
100:32 - okay so now
100:36 - whenever I execute this query this query
100:39 - will be executed and the result will be
100:41 - transferred to this RS object okay so in
100:47 - the next line what I'm going to do I
100:49 - will make a while loop because this RS
100:52 - object gives the value one by one so I
100:56 - will use while and close this while loop
101:04 - here and I will copy this RS which is
101:07 - the result dot and then I will write
101:12 - next so this will this will give me the
101:16 - result one by one and if you see here
101:19 - this method returns me boolean value
101:22 - that means until and unless this next is
101:27 - true or unten analogous we are we are
101:31 - getting the values from the database
101:33 - this while loop will go on otherwise
101:36 - whenever this method will be false then
101:39 - it will go out of the loop right okay so
101:43 - in this while loop what I'm going to do
101:45 - is first of all above this while loop I
101:48 - will create integer int count is equal
101:54 - to zero okay and this count I will in
101:58 - the while loop I will increase this
102:00 - count
102:01 - so I will write count is equal to count
102:05 - plus one you can use other type to
102:10 - increment this like for example count
102:13 - plus plus so it depends upon you right
102:17 - for now I'm using counting we will count
102:19 - plus one okay and then depending upon
102:24 - the count I ain't get I want to show the
102:30 - messages so this count I will tell you
102:34 - why I have done like that but I want to
102:37 - show the message on the basis of count
102:39 - first
102:39 - so if
102:42 - if this count is equal to one this will
102:50 - be double equal to right is equal to one
102:54 - then I want to show the message here I
102:57 - will copy this J option pain not show
102:59 - message dialog in the if condition and I
103:04 - will I will say this one user name and
103:14 - password is correct okay and else else
103:25 - if I get the count greater than 1
103:32 - greater than 1 then I will say I have
103:48 - duplicate user and password I will
103:51 - explain you why I'm writing like this
103:56 - duplicate user in name and password and
104:00 - else else I won't show username and
104:07 - password is not correct so I will show
104:10 - the message username and password is not
104:14 - correct okay
104:17 - and I will also show you maybe some
104:21 - message like try again or whatever so
104:28 - why I have declared this count here is
104:32 - so once this query is passed and
104:36 - username and password it checks from on
104:39 - the basis of whatever I enter in these
104:41 - text boxes text box name for the
104:44 - username and Xbox name for the password
104:47 - and it will go it will keep the result
104:50 - in this RS and whenever whatever result
104:53 - RS this this counter will increase okay
104:57 - so if only if our result
105:01 - oh so whenever we pass the query we get
105:05 - the result and if we get only one result
105:07 - that means it has matched the username
105:11 - and password because we only have one
105:13 - result as a as a result that means it's
105:19 - our username and password is correct if
105:22 - we get no result then we say the
105:26 - username and password is not correct but
105:28 - if we get multiple result greater than 1
105:31 - that means there is some mistake there
105:34 - there are duplicate username and
105:36 - password in our database ok so I will
105:40 - explain all these condition or I will
105:43 - show demonstrate all these condition one
105:45 - by one when I run the program but the
105:48 - one of the most important thing is
105:50 - whenever you write a query and execute
105:55 - of query you need to close the
105:57 - connection after you execute the query
106:00 - so
106:01 - after this try-catch block which you
106:04 - have written what you need to do is yo
106:09 - you your query is executed you get the
106:11 - result and after getting the result you
106:14 - need to close the connection with the
106:17 - database because SQLite is only
106:22 - providing one connection at a time okay
106:25 - there is a constraint with SQLite you
106:28 - need to make one connection at a time
106:30 - with SQLite database
106:32 - so after this try/catch block at the end
106:34 - of this catch block you may write
106:39 - finally and then and finally you can
106:45 - once again write try and catch catch and
106:57 - in here you can close the connection in
107:03 - the catch or in the trance re so in here
107:06 - I will write the exception which is
107:09 - which I will show you here once again
107:12 - this will be exception and in the try I
107:16 - will close the connection so I have
107:18 - created this prepared statement here
107:21 - right so how I can close the connection
107:25 - if I have these outside these try block
107:30 - because it will not make a nice MV they
107:33 - are in side this time block because of
107:36 - the localization constraint okay so now
107:42 - I can use this prepared statement like
107:47 - this and if it's not showing unhandled
107:51 - exception okay so let's see do it here
107:56 - and instead of using this you can simply
108:00 - do one more thing which is more easier
108:04 - at the end of this try block so just at
108:08 - the end of this tribe of and above this
108:11 - catch block what you need to do is you
108:14 - just right
108:15 - RS which is our result set RS which is
108:20 - this one result set object dot close and
108:28 - PST PST which is our prepared statement
108:34 - right
108:35 - PST this one dot close and what this two
108:44 - line will do is after executing your
108:46 - query they will close the connection
108:48 - with the database so that whenever you
108:51 - want to use this connection once again
108:52 - in the other method you are ready to use
108:56 - the connection and the connection is not
108:58 - open so these two lines take care of
109:00 - that
109:01 - now I will run the program and you see I
109:04 - have this database open here so I will
109:08 - show you what happens when this database
109:10 - is open I will run the program and I
109:15 - will say login dot Java okay first of
109:18 - all I will get the message connection
109:21 - successful that means I am I am
109:23 - successfully connected to the database
109:25 - then I have these username and password
109:28 - field and let's see what's there in the
109:32 - username and password so I have the
109:34 - username is equal to 1 for the first
109:36 - employee username is equal to 1 password
109:38 - is equal to 1 right so enter this
109:41 - username is equal to 1 ask what is equal
109:43 - to 1 and you see here this my password
109:46 - is masked with this dot symbol because I
109:50 - have used password field for that and I
109:53 - will click this login once again or I
109:56 - will lick click this login button and
109:58 - what happens Java long array out of
110:04 - found exception so I want to see what is
110:11 - this
110:13 - so I will pause the video and I will see
110:16 - what the error is and then I will come
110:18 - back so I found the error which I am
110:23 - facing so in this try-catch block if you
110:27 - remember I have written this query let's
110:30 - collect weddy then I have prepared the
110:32 - prepared statement which is PST then I
110:34 - was passing this set string here
110:38 - PST dots a string and I was writing the
110:41 - index here right so index of the text
110:45 - field username was 1 or 0 and index for
110:49 - the password for was 1 right 0 & 1 so I
110:55 - checked it and this index start from a 1
110:59 - not 0 so this should be 1 & 2 okay so
111:03 - this index should be 1 & 2 not 0 & 1 so
111:08 - username for index username start from 1
111:12 - and password will be 2 okay now when we
111:16 - run the program once again run the
111:20 - program connection successful let's see
111:25 - what user name we have user name one
111:28 - password 1 okay all right user name one
111:32 - password one password is masked login
111:36 - username and password is correct because
111:38 - it matches the username and password
111:41 - from him now suppose we enter some
111:44 - random username which is not there in
111:47 - the database
111:48 - okay I will just click this and now you
111:51 - see the message username and password is
111:53 - not correct try again okay I will try
111:56 - again so if you see here for employee ID
112:03 - 2 and employee ID 3 I have duplicate
112:06 - username and password this I have done
112:08 - intentionally to check whether it gives
112:11 - me the result duplicate the username and
112:13 - password so I have 4 employee ID - 2
112:16 - username and password - and - and same
112:19 - for employee I did three two and two
112:21 - username and password so i will write
112:23 - username - password
112:26 - and let's see what happens I see I get
112:30 - to placate user name and password that
112:32 - means the user name and password for
112:36 - employee ID 2 & 3 is duplicate so they
112:40 - has to be changed so we have
112:44 - successfully created a login page using
112:47 - our windowbuilder GUI application in
112:51 - Java hello guys welcome once again in
112:54 - this video I'm going to show you how you
112:56 - can add images and icons to your
113:00 - component and to the frame for example
113:04 - you want to add some icon to this login
113:07 - button or for example you want to add
113:11 - some image to this login frame how you
113:14 - can do it I will show you in this video
113:17 - so for example you want to show some
113:21 - image in here for the login page so what
113:27 - you can do is you can use this jail able
113:31 - to have your image inside your jlabel
113:37 - and I will remove the text inside this
113:43 - jlabel
113:43 - and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
113:47 - resize this jlabel
113:49 - like this according to the size of the
113:53 - image for example I have okay okay now
114:00 - what I'm going to do is in this label I
114:05 - want to set some image so I want to have
114:07 - some image post right so what I
114:11 - generally do is on I go to internet
114:16 - browser and I search for the images
114:18 - which are free to use images and icon
114:21 - which are free to use and there are lots
114:24 - of website which provide images which
114:27 - are free to use or open source and for
114:31 - example I will give you an example I
114:33 - know outside fall I can
114:39 - archive this as you see so many number
114:45 - of images and icons and you can have
114:48 - them or free right so for example I want
114:51 - to have some image for login I'll make
114:55 - this a little bit bigger so I will write
114:59 - here login and you will see some images
115:03 - in here so for example I will want to
115:07 - have this image in my login frame I can
115:11 - just choose this PNG you can even have
115:15 - the size of the image you want to have
115:19 - right for example you want to have 48 by
115:23 - 48 this size will be changed 48 by 48 ok
115:28 - or you can say all and this size you
115:33 - will get the regular size here so I want
115:37 - this regular size I will click the PNG
115:40 - right-click it and I will say save image
115:45 - as and I will save this image wherever
115:52 - for for in whatever folder I want for
115:55 - example I want to say with this image
115:57 - here I will save it here in my pictures
116:00 - folder and for example I want to have
116:06 - the icon for and this login button ok
116:11 - the image I have downloaded right now is
116:13 - for this login frame and I want an icon
116:17 - here on the login button for this login
116:21 - button so what I can do I can search for
116:24 - for example ok I can and you see here ok
116:31 - I can and I want to resize it for
116:33 - example 24 cross 24 pixel and once again
116:39 - I can take this PNG and I can see this
116:43 - and I save this image as
116:47 - this image on my pictures folder for it
116:50 - for now okay
116:52 - now the next thing I will do is I will
116:55 - change the name because they are quite
116:59 - long so for example I will change the
117:03 - name of this picture else only login and
117:09 - I will change this picture as only okay
117:17 - icon okay now what I need to do is for
117:22 - showing this picture on this label what
117:25 - I need to do is I will just double click
117:28 - this login dot Java so I can see my
117:33 - package Explorer here and in my project
117:36 - 1 what I need to do is just right click
117:39 - your project what in whatever project
117:42 - you are in and new and just add a source
117:47 - folder ok so go to project new and just
117:51 - add a source for source folder and you
117:55 - need to give the name to the source
117:57 - folder I name my episodes folder as IMG
118:01 - for images ok IMG finish and now I have
118:08 - the source folder and now what I can do
118:10 - is I can go to the pictures which I have
118:15 - downloaded just select all these
118:18 - pictures drag this picture to this image
118:22 - folder ok drag this picture to the image
118:24 - folder and you will see this message
118:27 - click OK and now you have these pictures
118:31 - in side your source folder ok if you
118:35 - don't see this these images inside your
118:37 - source folder right click and refresh so
118:42 - now you have these pictures inside your
118:45 - image source folder what you need to do
118:48 - is next for example I go to my project
118:52 - wherever I have created my project
118:55 - generally it's in workspace and the name
118:58 - of the project my project name is
118:59 - company and
119:01 - in here I will go to the bin folder or
119:03 - you you see here we have created this
119:05 - image folder and in these this image we
119:08 - have these two images I will go to the
119:11 - binary folder and you see here they are
119:16 - copied to the binary folder also right
119:20 - so they are automatically copied to the
119:23 - binary folder I haven't copied them but
119:26 - when I click it refreshed they are
119:27 - automatically copied to my binary folder
119:30 - or otherwise what you can do is you can
119:33 - right-click and you can you can run your
119:40 - project or you can just run your project
119:44 - once again from here and these images
119:47 - will be copied in your in your a binary
119:53 - folder here okay so once you have these
119:57 - images in your binary folder it's easy
120:01 - to use them in your jlabel so what you
120:06 - need to do here is now just go to I will
120:13 - just double click and make it bigger and
120:15 - go to source yeah and search for this
120:19 - label wherever you have created this
120:21 - label this label is this one which has
120:24 - no text here right so in here what I
120:27 - need to do is I need to give the part of
120:32 - the image and set the icon to this label
120:35 - this is the label I want to set this
120:37 - icon right so just below the Declaration
120:41 - of this label you can just set this icon
120:47 - to the label like this okay
120:49 - so just write image IMG is equal to new
120:56 - image and what what yeah so just write
121:06 - this these two lines leave two lines we
121:10 - need to use and these two in this two
121:12 - line what we are doing
121:14 - we are just declaring this image this
121:17 - image is a part of this java dot awp dot
121:23 - image this one okay so if the this image
121:27 - it's showing you any error just import
121:31 - java.awt dot star so it'll add all the
121:36 - awp year libraries in your system okay
121:41 - so go to your image and just write image
121:43 - IMG is equal to new image icon and
121:46 - inside this bracket as a parameter you
121:49 - need to pass this this is indicate to
121:52 - dis class which is login dot Java dot
121:55 - class dot get resources and inside this
121:59 - bracket we will pass the argument slash
122:01 - forward slash and the name of the icon
122:04 - so the name of the I icon or name of the
122:08 - image which I want to show in this label
122:10 - is name of the icon is login dot PNG
122:14 - okay so I will change this name as login
122:20 - dot PNG login dot PNG right and then get
122:27 - image okay so this line will be like
122:31 - this and now once you have this image
122:34 - from the source code you just need to
122:37 - pass this image in your label so just
122:39 - call the name of the label in my case
122:42 - this is the label name which is label
122:45 - itself dot set icon and inside the
122:48 - bracket just write new image icon and
122:51 - pass this image object here so you need
122:55 - to write these two lines in order to set
122:58 - your image and when you go to the design
123:00 - view here you will be able to see your
123:03 - image but there is a one catch
123:07 - you cannot resize or your image like
123:09 - this right so choose the image which can
123:14 - fit your label the resizing of image can
123:18 - be done but it's a long code and I in
123:22 - the beginning video I don't want to show
123:24 - this code to you so it's easier to have
123:27 - the image
123:28 - which have the same size as your label
123:31 - so now you have fixed this image in your
123:37 - label now you want to have a icon on
123:41 - this login button right so what you can
123:46 - do is you can do the same thing just go
123:51 - to your code and copy these two lines
123:55 - which I have just explained you and
123:57 - wherever your login button declaration
124:00 - is which is let's see where our login
124:05 - button here so we have this Login button
124:10 - declaration just below this you can set
124:14 - this image and this image was called
124:19 - okay image right so I will just right
124:23 - under the button okay dot PNG and I will
124:29 - go to the design view and it's not
124:33 - showing let's see why so why it's
124:38 - showing an error because I haven't
124:41 - changed this label name as button login
124:44 - so name of the button just take the name
124:47 - of the button and in here just paste the
124:50 - name of the button right so this code
124:52 - will be like this and don't forget to
124:54 - change the name of the button which is
124:56 - this one and I go to design view once
124:59 - again I will be able to see this image
125:02 - here okay so in this way you can add
125:06 - images and icons to your components
125:11 - hello guys welcome once again in this
125:13 - video I'm going to show you how you can
125:15 - open a second jframe using a first chip
125:18 - frame in your Eclipse GUI application so
125:23 - for example I want to open a second J
125:27 - frame for example employee info jframe
125:31 - whenever user has passed the login test
125:35 - for example username and password is
125:37 - correct then I want to open a second jf
125:42 - okay so how can I do it I will show you
125:45 - in this video but first of all I need a
125:47 - second jframe right so I need to create
125:52 - the second jframe so I will go to my
125:54 - project or I will I will go to my source
125:57 - folder of my project company is my
126:01 - project name and this is SRC with the so
126:03 - folder of my project I click new and go
126:08 - to others and in here
126:10 - search for window builder and search for
126:13 - swing designer but this time we will not
126:18 - select application window we will select
126:21 - this time at jframe application window
126:24 - will create a main method inside your
126:27 - jframe and the main method could be only
126:30 - one right and this jframe is a just a
126:35 - frame other frame so you need to choose
126:37 - in this swing designer jframe right so
126:41 - it select just a frame click next and
126:43 - give the name to your class
126:45 - I'd give my give the name to my class
126:48 - I'll employ
126:57 - employee is it correct or let's say what
127:03 - can mean sometimes I get confused in the
127:08 - spelling so once again employee info
127:14 - okay my class name is employing four
127:17 - because I am dealing with the employee
127:20 - database right so I want to show the
127:24 - employee data in the second form okay
127:26 - I'll name my last name accordingly and I
127:31 - will click finish and this will create a
127:35 - second poem for me which is a blank form
127:37 - which is called employee info dot Java
127:40 - you can see here I go to my design view
127:43 - of this class which is employing four
127:46 - dot Java I will double click on this
127:49 - blue info dot Java so I can see this and
127:52 - for now I will just show some message I
127:56 - will take a label but before that I need
127:59 - to have this absolute layout inside this
128:01 - and then I will put the label and I will
128:07 - just say
128:11 - second form for now okay and maybe I can
128:16 - just resize it so we will be able to see
128:20 - the message and maybe I will change the
128:26 - font size so that it's variable
128:33 - okay
128:35 - so I want to open this frame from my
128:38 - login train right so if you remember we
128:42 - have written our code to login username
128:47 - and so username and password validate
128:50 - user name and password and whenever we
128:52 - click this login button we will be able
128:56 - to see the message if the username and
128:58 - password is correct or not so just click
129:00 - this login button once again and this
129:04 - was the code which I have written so if
129:07 - you don't remember this code just see my
129:09 - last videos in which I have shown you
129:12 - how to create a login page and in here
129:15 - where my validation is correct where I
129:19 - am showing username and password is
129:20 - correct I want to open the new frame
129:24 - which is employee in full frame right
129:27 - and I want to close this frame ok so
129:31 - first of all I walk I will close this
129:32 - frame how can I close this frame just
129:36 - take the name of your cream so the frame
129:40 - name is frame only you see a private jet
129:44 - frame frame so take the name of your
129:46 - frame go to the condition where your
129:50 - username and password this correct
129:52 - username and password is correct I was
129:54 - showing there and in here frame dot
129:58 - dispose okay this will dispose your
130:01 - frame or hide your frame ok and then I
130:05 - will call the new class so I will create
130:09 - an object of the new class my class name
130:11 - is employee info class right so you see
130:16 - here I will created this new class
130:17 - employee info class right all right
130:23 - employee info I will say the object name
130:30 - is empl I an echo for example is equal
130:38 - to new employee info so I'm creating an
130:47 - object of this class and now I can use
130:51 - this object to call the set visible
130:56 - method which is responsible to make your
131:00 - frame visible so I use this object which
131:03 - is MP L in for God set visible and what
131:09 - it takes this method takes a boolean
131:12 - value so I want to make this true to
131:16 - show this frame right so whenever I use
131:20 - this true then this second class will be
131:26 - visible for me or second frame will be
131:27 - visible for me so you just need to write
131:31 - these two lines write two or three lines
131:35 - and once again I run the program click
131:39 - OK it will open error exists in required
131:45 - project
131:46 - let's see what is the error
131:55 - I can't see any error here it shows any
132:00 - error duplicate local I am G okay so
132:06 - this I think I have in the last video I
132:10 - have made showing you how to show the
132:14 - image and I think I have created
132:17 - somewhere here some image which is this
132:21 - I can call it image one ok now this
132:25 - error will not come I'll run it once
132:28 - again okay and connection is successful
132:35 - okay and use an image I need to give a
132:38 - username and password I will you give
132:40 - the username and password and when I
132:43 - click this login button I will see first
132:46 - of all this message username and
132:48 - password is correct and when I click OK
132:50 - you see I can see the second form and
132:54 - first form is this post that means it is
132:58 - gone and second form is open the same
133:02 - thing you can do for calling the login
133:07 - from form from the employee form okay so
133:10 - for example you want to go from this
133:13 - form to the previous form which is the
133:15 - login form you can do the same with this
133:18 - hello guys welcome 'once again in the
133:21 - last video I have shown you how to open
133:22 - a second form using your login form in
133:26 - your Eclipse Java GUI application in
133:29 - this video I'm going to show you how you
133:31 - can load your data in a J table in this
133:35 - second form so for example you have this
133:37 - data in the table in the database right
133:40 - I want to show all this data in my J
133:45 - table in my Eclipse GUI how can I do
133:48 - this so I will start with this video by
133:53 - just removing this label which I have
133:56 - used in the last video and now my form
133:59 - employee info form is blank ok so I will
134:03 - resize this form
134:06 - I will resize this form and in here I
134:10 - will take a button to load the table and
134:16 - I will take J table
134:22 - okay so search for J table here it is
134:26 - and the trick of using J table in the
134:29 - form is just select this J table and
134:32 - then make us big square here okay
134:36 - otherwise if you just select this table
134:39 - and dry select here click here then it
134:42 - will not be visible so select your table
134:45 - and make us big square okay now what I'm
134:48 - going to do is I will right-click my
134:50 - table so I will right-click my table and
134:54 - surround my table with J scroll pane
134:57 - okay so right click once again
135:01 - right-click the table and go to surround
135:03 - with surround width and then surround
135:07 - with Java X dot swing dot J scroll pane
135:11 - so I have surrounded my table by J
135:14 - scroll pane now what I can do is I can
135:19 - change the name of this button has
135:24 - button load table or whatever you feel
135:32 - like and I will also change the text of
135:34 - this button has load employee data for
135:44 - example okay you can even change the
135:48 - name of your table but I will leave it
135:51 - as default so this table is inside your
135:54 - straw pane right so whenever you select
135:57 - your table you will see the scroll pin
136:00 - because your table is inside this roll
136:02 - pin right so now once you have these
136:07 - both things I will just double click my
136:09 - button and I will reach to the source
136:13 - code of this button actionperformed
136:15 - method but first of all I need to
136:20 - this form with the database right as I
136:23 - have done with login dot Java class
136:27 - right so we have connected this frame to
136:30 - the SQLite class which we have created
136:32 - so this employee info dot Java file also
136:36 - we need to connect with SQLite class and
136:40 - how we can do it just go to our
136:41 - excellent SQLite connection class and
136:43 - take all the import copy all the imports
136:46 - from here which is import Java dot SQL
136:48 - dot star import Java X dot swings or
136:52 - star and just go to your employee info
136:55 - form and paste these two imports here
136:58 - also the second thing I have done is I
137:02 - need to make the connection with the
137:04 - class so I need to declare the
137:07 - connection object so go to your
137:10 - constructor constructor of the class is
137:12 - the same name as your class name so just
137:15 - search for the method which has the same
137:17 - name has your class and this is my
137:19 - constructor just go above this and I
137:22 - will declare a connection to my SQLite
137:25 - class of for example so all right
137:29 - connection connection is equal to null
137:35 - so this is a connection object I made
137:37 - and this connection class belongs to
137:41 - that Java dot SQL dot connection class
137:45 - okay so you see here Java dot SQL dot
137:51 - connection class this class now go
137:53 - inside your constructor which is the
137:55 - same name as if class just inside and
137:58 - copy this connection object paste it
138:01 - here
138:02 - is equal to the name of your SQLite
138:06 - connection class my escolar connection
138:08 - class name is SQLite connection dot Java
138:10 - which we had created earlier
138:11 - a still light connection dot the
138:18 - connection method inside the connection
138:22 - class white if you have remembered now I
138:25 - will once again go to my
138:29 - load table and just click this button
138:32 - once again I reach to the action perform
138:36 - I've heard of this button click event
138:38 - and in here I will write the code so
138:41 - what I need to do is I need to write the
138:46 - code for this button action perform so
138:50 - what I'm going to do is first of all is
138:53 - the try catch block so I will just copy
138:55 - the blank try catch block from here and
138:59 - inside the scribe Blanc I'm going to
139:02 - write the code first to create the query
139:06 - and I will pass this query to the
139:08 - connection so I will write the
139:11 - connection where e first so string which
139:14 - is where is a string variable so query
139:19 - is equal to double quotes and semicolon
139:24 - and here I will pass the query which is
139:26 - select star from your table name my
139:33 - table name in my database is employee
139:35 - info so I will write it here select all
139:39 - from this employee info okay now next in
139:45 - the next line I will pass this query to
139:48 - the prepared statement so I will create
139:50 - a create a prepared statement prepared
139:58 - statement PSD is equal to then take the
140:03 - name of the connection object which is
140:06 - connection from here which we have
140:08 - created above so connection dot prepared
140:14 - statement we need to write it here so
140:16 - let's copy the connection dot prepared
140:21 - statement and just pass your query here
140:24 - okay
140:26 - so this query string will go here now we
140:30 - will declare a result set result set and
140:39 - which will be my RS variable is equal to
140:43 - and then PSD my prepared statement
140:47 - object dot execute query so this will
140:53 - execute the query and pass the result to
140:55 - the result set which is RS right now I
140:59 - will take the name of my table so first
141:02 - of all you once you have this result set
141:06 - you can load the table in different ways
141:08 - and there this will be a long task to
141:13 - load this table model or to convert this
141:17 - result set into a table model and load
141:20 - this so what is the easy way of doing
141:23 - this if you can download a glass jar
141:28 - file which is freely a freely available
141:31 - on internet and I use this class to make
141:34 - my model for the table using this result
141:37 - set so I'm going to show how you can
141:41 - download this class just go to your
141:45 - browser and search for RS - XML dot jar
141:48 - free download okay so search for RS -
141:52 - XML dot jar free for download and the
141:55 - first link you will find here is from
141:57 - sourceforge.net okay so go to this
142:01 - sourceforge.net and I will just pass or
142:06 - paste the link in the description so you
142:09 - can directly click this link and come to
142:12 - this site and you just need to download
142:14 - this RS - XML dot jar and what this jar
142:18 - is it contains a class which helps us to
142:22 - convert our result set to our data model
142:26 - it's just like that okay once you have
142:31 - this RS - XML jar file in your downloads
142:35 - here so I have this RS - XML file here
142:38 - then
142:40 - what I can do is I can just go to my
142:44 - project Explorer here and in this in
142:48 - this resources folder which I have
142:51 - created earlier which contains SQLite
142:54 - JDBC or other jar file which I have
142:57 - downloaded earlier I can drag and drop
143:00 - this RS to XML in this resources folder
143:04 - just drag and drop there and once you
143:08 - have dragged and dropped there and click
143:11 - OK this RS to XML file will go into this
143:16 - resources folder now once you have this
143:19 - RS to XML dot jar in resources folder go
143:23 - to JRE system library here right click
143:26 - this and go to build path and go to
143:29 - configure build path and in here in the
143:33 - library tab just add a jar which is
143:37 - there in your resource file which is RS
143:39 - to XML dot jar file click OK click OK
143:43 - now this jar file is added to a project
143:46 - and you can easily use the classes from
143:49 - the jar file in your project once again
143:53 - in my button click event which is a load
143:57 - table button click event here I have
144:00 - written this code I have created a query
144:03 - prepared statement and passed the query
144:07 - to this connection prepared statement
144:10 - and this prepared spit statement I have
144:12 - executed and I have this result set in
144:15 - the result set right what I can do next
144:19 - is I can copy the name of the table my
144:22 - table name is let's see what is the name
144:25 - of the table so the table name was table
144:33 - here you see a table name a walls table
144:37 - okay so if you don't find the table name
144:40 - just go at the start of your class where
144:44 - public class declaration is there your
144:47 - class name extend jframe and in here you
144:50 - will find your table name which is table
144:53 - right in our case just come to your
144:56 - button action perform method here paste
145:00 - the name of the table dot add or not add
145:06 - but set model table dot set model if we
145:12 - have this and in here we will paste our
145:18 - model so what this jar will help us to
145:23 - use this result set convert our model so
145:29 - what we can use is DB utils this DB
145:38 - utils is is a class inside this RS to
145:42 - XML right
145:43 - so just hover over this and you will
145:46 - find or let me pause the video and see
145:53 - okay so this DB utils is a class inside
145:57 - this RS to XML jar file so I will just
146:00 - write this DB utils like this so just
146:04 - write DB utils dot result set to table
146:10 - model okay
146:11 - and this DB util first it will show an
146:15 - error and when you hover over this DB
146:17 - util so just go and hover your mouse
146:21 - above this error for DB util and you
146:25 - will see you need to import this net dot
146:30 - protein knit dot SQL file so just click
146:36 - this import here just click this and
146:38 - what this will do it will import this
146:43 - class in here so net dot whatever this
146:46 - is called pro te a nit dot
146:50 - SQL dot DB util it will import this and
146:54 - then your error in the button action
146:57 - perform will go okay so now you you have
147:03 - converted with the help of this class
147:05 - your result set a
147:07 - to a model which your table takes and
147:10 - then this result set will be converted
147:13 - to model and then you can run your
147:16 - program now I will run my program once
147:19 - again connection successful username and
147:28 - password we gave the user name and the
147:32 - password login successful and then I can
147:37 - see the second form and when I click
147:40 - this load table just see here what
147:42 - happens it says something let's see what
147:48 - is the error so I will look at the error
147:52 - SQL error SQL error for missing database
147:57 - okay so I know why we are facing this
148:01 - error I have created this connection
148:04 - class I think
148:05 - but yeah I'm doing this also so I let me
148:10 - find the error and I will come to you
148:13 - okay so I found the error my query here
148:17 - is wrong I have written select star form
148:21 - it should not be formed but from fr om
148:27 - okay
148:28 - so now I have corrected this query which
148:31 - is select start from it's not form but
148:34 - from your table name once again I will
148:37 - run the program and I will see this
148:43 - second form and when I click this load
148:45 - table or load employee data I see my
148:49 - data from the database in this table
148:52 - right so I will check with my original
148:56 - database which is this one and you can
148:59 - see here the data matches employee ID 1
149:03 - 2 3 4 name mark John Julie Peter age 35
149:08 - 25 30 21 you can see here 35 25 30 so I
149:14 - have this data in the table ok but for
149:19 - example for some reason
149:21 - you don't want to show username and
149:26 - password because whenever you click this
149:30 - button it's also showing username and
149:32 - password but you don't want to show it
149:34 - what you can do you can change the query
149:37 - which you have written yes select star
149:39 - from employee info instead of star which
149:43 - which query all the data instead of star
149:46 - just try select and whatever column you
149:50 - want to select for example you just want
149:52 - to show a ID name surname and age just
149:55 - select these column names just right
149:58 - select key ID comma name comma surname
150:06 - comma age for example okay
150:10 - select all the name separated by commas
150:13 - select the ID name surname and age from
150:16 - your table name and once again run the
150:20 - program and now when I load this I will
150:27 - only see a ID name surname and age which
150:31 - I have a party ID name surname and age
150:34 - right so in this way you can load your
150:38 - data in je table from your database I
150:42 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
150:43 - wait come in here subscribe and bye for
150:45 - now

Cleaned transcript:

so first of all in order to install eclipse you need to have Java installed on your system so in order to install Java JDK you just need to go to your favorite browser and search for Java JDK and if you want to install Java JDK 8 then you can click on this link which says Java SE development kit 8 and this will redirect you to this page where you can install Java development kit 8 on your windows 10 operating system so you just need to accept the license agreement and then you can just download this executable file and run it and Java will be installed if you want to install the latest version of Java which is Java JDK 10 at the time of making this video then you can click this link which says Java SE downloads I will put the link in the description so you can directly click on this and then you just need to go to this page and you can see Java plateform JDK 10 is the latest version so I'm going to click on this and once again you just need to do the same you just need to accept license agreement and then you can install JDK 10 so whatever version of JDK you want to install you can install it from this oracle.com website in case you face any problem in the installation of Java JDK I have already created a video in which I have shown you how to install Java 10 on your windows 10 operating system so first watch that video install java jdk on your windows 10 operating system and then come to this video so once you have java installed on your system we are ready to install eclipse on our windows 10 operating system so just once again go to your favorite browser and search for eclipse and the first link which will appear here will be from eclipse.org g so i'm going to click on this link and you can direct see this download button on the top or if you want to learn more about the latest version which is eclipse photon you can click on the learn more button also which is going to redirect you to the eclipse photon page from here also you can just click the download button so I'm going to click on the download button and now I can see this webpage and here I can see the download button and this file will be installed so this file will be an executable file which we can execute on our Windows 10 operating system so I'm going to click on this Downloads button and you can see the download of this Eclipse inst wind 64 dot exe has been started so I will wait for the download to complete so now this executable file is downloaded on my systems don't click on this executable file yet I'm going to go to the folder where it's downloaded so I'm going to just say show in the folder where it's downloaded and here it is in my downloads folder so I want to open it as an administrator ok so just right click on this executable file and then just click on this option which says run as administrator ok this is important and then click yes and I'm going to minimize this folder explorer and I'm going to minimize this browser also and once your Eclipse installer is started you will see the interface like this so you will be able to download a Eclipse IDE for Java developers from here or Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers or Eclipse IDE for C++ PHP and other languages so what we are going to do is we are going to install the first option which is Eclipse IDE for Java developers so I'm going to click on this option and now you will see the next window here and this will be the location where Eclipse IDE will be installed and then it says create start menu entry and create stop shortcut I want both of them so I will give everything as default and I'm going to click on the install button and first of all you will see this kind of license terms and conditions so I'm going to click on accept now which is going to start the installation of Eclipse IDE so now the installation of this Eclipse IDE has been completed and I can see this launch button so I'm going to click on this which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE on my Windows 10 operating system and first of all when Eclipse IDE starts after the installation it will ask you to select our directory as a workspace so if you want to change this workspace directory you can browse for that directory which you want to set it as a workspace and then you can just click on use it as a default and then I'm going to just click on the launch button which is going to launch the Eclipse IDE and now you can see this Eclipse IDE has been started so let's create a Java project in order to verify if everything is working fine so first of all what I will do is I will just click on this file option and I'm going to just go to new and then I'm going to just click on this option which says Java project and then I'm going to just give the name of my Java project which is hollow bold and then you can see under JRE Java SE 10 is chosen automatically by Eclipse IDE for us if you have the different version other than Java SC 10 then that version will be displayed here ok and then under the project layout there are two options use the project folder as the root for the source and the class file and other s create a separate folder for source and class file so I will also leave this as default and I'm going to click on the next button and here you will be able to do more settings about your Java project I am going to leave everything as default and I'm going to click on finish and I'm going to just click on create' button and this is going to create your helloworld.java project now you will see here this Java project is not shown here because I need to minimize this welcome window so just click on this minimize button which is going to minimize this welcome window and then you will be able to see this kind of hello world project here so you can see our Java project has been created and this has a file called module info dot Java for now I'm going to just remove this file and I will create a new class file so I'm going to just right click on the source and then I'm going to choose new and then I'm going to choose the class option from here and I want to name my class as demo for example and then I'm going to leave everything as default and in here under which method stop would you like to create I'm going to choose this checkbox which says public static void main which is going to create this public static void main method for me and I'm going to click finish for now and this is going to create this demo dot Java class and here you can see public static void main method has been created so let's print something so I'm going to just write system dot out dot print Ln for print line and let's print HelloWorld for now so I'm going to just write hello world in between the double quotes and I'm going to save this Java file and I'm going to run this Java file using this green button here and you can see hello world is displayed on the console so in this way you can download and install Eclipse IDE on your windows 10 operating system hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install a window builder plugin in your Eclipse IDE it's also called GUI plugin and this GUI plugin enables you to develop your Java GUI applications in Eclipse so let's see we can install this window builder plugin so fire up your Eclipse and go to the help tab here and then go to install new software and in here in the work with space here you need to click this combo box here this one it will give you some options and what we want to choose here is HTTP colon slash slash download dot eclipse.org e it will be there also in your Eclipse also slash release slash I have the latest version which is Luna but if you have some other version it will show you that version of Eclipse for example Juno or Kepler so just select this option which says HTTP slash download dot eclipse.org e / literally release slash whatever version of Eclipse you have I have Luna so I will select this Luna ok and this will give you some options here what option we are interested in is called journal purse tool this one ok so just select this general purpose tool and then search for so go down a little and in here we are searching for swing designer so everything which is under this wing design or below this swing designer we need to check this so this is swing designer and I check all the options below swing designer up to the end of window builder all these things windowbuilder so all these option which says windowbuilder or spring designer you need to check ok window builder and swing designer ok and once you are selected all these options related to Windows builder and swing designer what you need to do you need to just click this next button and calculate the requirement and dependencies it will give you this list here and you can review your items once again and click Next and this is the license terms condition you say I accept terms of license agreement and click finish and then the installation of software will start it will take some time depending upon the speed of your internet and the selection of your files so if you have selected more files or more software to install it will take more time and let's see how much time it takes here if it will take more time I will just pause the video and restart it once its installed I think I will pause the video once it these this installation is complete and then I will continue with this video okay or it's already finishing yes it's finished okay so it says you will need to restart Eclipse for the changes to take effect what do you like to restart so I will say yes I want to restart and restart my Eclipse you see I have eclipse Luna installed which is the latest version at the time of making this video and load all of your plugin you have installed and now eclipse has started okay so once you have successfully installed these window bleep in the plugin and swing designer plugin you can develop project using these window builder and swing the banner so how you can create a new project using these windowbuilder just go to file new Java project and in here you will be able to see the options to make the Java project but I think I should go to new and in here you should go to others right so go to new and then it will show the options others go to others or other and in here such or windowbuilder so this is the window builder and in here such or swing designer and select application window okay so go to window builder swing designer and select this application window here okay and click Next and now you just need to give the path or give the path to your or give the name to your project I will give the name to my project as hello world project and for example I want to change this location of the folder I can choose the location right now I've already have this project hello world here so I've not changed the default location but yeah I can do it with and it says type the name with same name but different case exists so I will say hello world laughs for example and this is the use of default package is discouraged I will go and finish this and now I will have this designer tool here so it has generated me this code and when I go to this design tab it we are run right now in the source tab so when we go in the design tab we will be able to see the design view of this code so this is what Eclipse windowbuilder has generated for us it will take some time to go into the design of you for the first time and you see we are in the design view okay so this is the frame which you get whenever you create a new window builder project right you can drag and drop these pallet tools from from this palette to the to this frame so for example I can drag and drop this J button here in order to drag and drop this J button I need to have this absolute layout so this all I will show in the next video but let's see what can we do with this so for now I'm just going to run the blank frame here and in the later video I will show you how you can design this frame with J button or jtextfield or J radio button or other tools which are there in this palette so what I'm going to do is I will just run this and you will be able to see this frame which is blank right now but when we design our frame with some buttons or menus and all the other things this will look really interactive and you will be able to design your GUI with this window builder now in this video I'm going to show you how you can write your first program using a GUI plugin or Java builder and we are going to make our first project in which we are going to make the Java GUI using window builder plugin so let's get started just fire up your Eclipse IDE and we already have installed will no builder so when you go to file here and choose new new option here first of all what you need to do is you need to create a new project for building your application so what you need to do file new and just say new Java project this one and in here you need to give the name for your project okay so for example I am going to give the name Java GUI demo for example okay and then all the settings will remain the same I will click Next and everything is okay I will click once again finish so it has created a new project for me which is Java GUI demo and there is nothing much in this project folder instead of this subfolder called source and there is no file inside this subfolder so we are going to add a project file or Java file in here to make our GUI so go to your project which you have created and go to this source folder subfolder there and right click this source folder and go to new and go to others or other this is the last option okay and in here we are searching for Windows builder which we have installed in the last video so just search for this option called window builder and then this with the window builder we are searching for swing designer and we want to select application window from here ok so just select in windowbuilder swing designer application window this one click Next and now you need to give the name to your class for that new window so I will name it as for example frame 1 ok and I will click finish and this will create me this frame 1 dot Java class and in here it you can see already some of the code which is generated by Eclipse for you ok and when you click this you have this design view of your project so there is a source view of your project and the design you project and in this design view you can design your frame whatever application you are working on and in the source view or its source code you need to write the the code behind your GUI ok so we will start with this design you one thing you will notice that it's a very small area you are working on and to increase this area so that you can easily see this whole frame and other things you just need to go here at the top where your frame 1 that Java tab is there just go there and double click it so click this 2 times double click it and we increase your area and it will hide all the project wizard here and last wizard here ok and when you want to go to once again to the last view view you just double click it once again ok double click it will maximize and double click it will come to its real state ok so double click this and now we can see this frame much easily ok now to add a component in this frame there is this wizard or this palette called tool palette or and in here you have different tools to add into your frame okay so you have some button radio button and different panels split panels and different kind of tools which you can use to make your GUI application right so first of all we need to add a layout to our frame so there are different type of layout but for the first video tutorial I'm going to use this absolute layout which is really easy to work with okay so I will just click this once you just need to click this you don't need to drag to your frame you just click it and just move your mouse on your frame okay so click and move your mouse on your frame and just click it once again and then this layout will be added to your frame this is a layout so you will not see any change because it's a layout in your frame so it will not be directly visible okay so just click this and add it here right in the same way for example I want to add a button to my layout which I have just added which is absolute layout I will click this J button from here just click it and then move your mouse to your frame okay and just click it once again and really leave it okay and when you leave it here you can add it your content or you can edit the text of this button directly from here or you can what you can do here you can rightclick and you can do some of the things from here also auto size and the things like action perform this is very important yeah and otherwise what you can do is you can select your tool or component and you can go to the properties of that component and these are the property you can change for this opponent so there are different properties for this component and one of the property is this text property and you can see in front of text property the text is new button and this is the text on your button so you can change this text by just going to this text property and you can add your text there so I can add for example show message okay so I want to show some message when I click this button okay and there are some other properties which you can use for example you can change the font for example if you want just click this font button here there's three dots button and you can make it bold and you can make or increase the size of this text okay and you can even use different font family with your button and click OK and then you will be able to see the change immediately on your button okay you can also change the background you can just click this and there are different background for this button and there are different color spring colors named colors so you can do many things with this background okay and there is something called foreground so background will change the background of this button so for example I want to have the green background light green or this light green background and I will click OK and this will change the background right and I want to change the fall foreground of this I can do it also by going to the foreground property and I can choose the foreground for example a little bit dark okay for example I choose this as a foreground and when I do this this text you will see the color of this text is change okay so in this way you can play with the properties there are many properties you can clear it and you will be able to change the property of your tool or your component okay now then what you need to do is for example you want to perform some action when you click this button so you need to write some code for that okay so for example I want to show some message when I click this button how can I do it I will just right click my button and I will say add event handler okay add here event handler and the first event handler this is a very basic event handler for every component which is action performed and this indicates to the basic action performed by the component so you can just go to action and just click action perform when you click this action perform you will reach to the codebehind or source for this button action performed here so you will see this here public void actionperformed right and in here in this method inside this action perform of this button what you can do you can write the code to perform some action so for example I want to show some message when I click this button I will go to the design view once again and you can what you need to do in order to go to the source code for this button but next in perform one you can do this one action perform or add handler and action perform from here or otherwise you can directly double click this button for action perform just double click it and you will be the same code here for example I want to show some message so I can write J option pain dot show so you can see some intelligence text come here so what ever so this Eclipse IDE supports intelligence and by the use of this intelligence you will be presented some of the possible options which you can use it with your code okay so I will say show message I want to show some message so I will just write and double click it and you will also see the my name when you hover over this method you will be able to see some help in here which you can see and you can read about this what this code do okay so I want to show some message so the first argument for this will be null and the second argument will be with the message which you want to show so in the double quotes I can give my message so for example I can say hi YouTube or something something else or whatever message you want to show so I want to show hi YouTube okay and once again I can go to the design view or I can go to the source view from here and here also and I just will run this code from here so when I click this green button here that will give me the resource or save the changes so it will ask me do you really want to save the changes and then it will compile your program so yes I want to save the tin so I will say select this frame 1 dot Java file and click OK it will save my changes and will show me this message here right and not the message but the frame yes which is called jframe and you can see the background of this button is green and foreground is a little bit dark okay when I click this button I want to see the message which I have written hi YouTube I will click this button and you can see the message here hi you do ok once again so you will be able to see the messages like this ok so background color I really don't I mean I don't really use this background color I like the inherent color of these component which is this this inherent color here so the second thing for example I want to add a text box so what you need to do take take a text box from here and click this jtextfield and just move your mouse to the frame and just click it once again and it says some error so I will remove this text box for now let's go giving me some error so let's remove this text box for now okay once again I will reach to the message box so for example I will take a jlabel if I can find it is there any J labels here okay list editor so you need to find your components from here so here it is J label so I can just click the syllable and drag and drop to my J frame and I can change the text of this J label from here also or from here also okay so new label I can change the text message okay I will show message it right or I can change the variable name for this so when you are using a bunch of different labels here and you want to know which label is performing what you need to change this variable name from here in order to you know know what this label is doing so you can just write label and this is a variable name by which you will recognize your label or any components you can change the variable name from here so I will say label message okay so it has changed the name of this label and then I can just double click this and instead of using or showing the message from this j option pin what I can do I can show the message in the label also so I will say the name of the label is so if you can see here the name of the label is I have changed it to LBL message this is just copy this and in this button action perform just paste it and then write dot so what was the name of my label the name of my label and I can say and shouldn't not showing anything let's see why so I found out what the problem is when I dragged and dropped this label in here in my frame and when I have seen this label its code is generated locally here so you see a jape label and then the Declaration of my label name or variable so what I need to do here is I need to copy this J label and the name of the label and at the top at the very top of my class just after wherever you see private J frame frame just below that just write the Declaration of the label also so just check whether it's already there if it's already there then it's okay otherwise we have to do it manually okay so just you need to just forward declare your label name as a global variable here and in here you just need to remove this J label from here okay so wherever your jail label declaration if there you just need to remove it and then this makes this label as a global variable and it can be called from other functions also okay so this is why we have done this because whenever we have dragged and dropped this label in here its code was generated locally by eclipse and we wanted to use this label in other in other functions also okay this this label name so what we have done we have changed the Declaration of this label as private J label the name of the label which you have given it and we have removed the Declaration of this J label here and just we use the name Jeb label is equal to you and this makes your the label global and then you can go to design once again doubleclick your show message once again make it bigger show message once again and in this action perform of this public void actionperformed you can use this label message dot set text and I can set any text to this label so for example I want to just set the same text to the label also I can do it like this ok so label dot set text and I will just save my program and I can run this and when I click this show message now this label is showing hello and we it's not showing the full YouTube because we need to resize our label from here I can resize my label like this ok and now the size of label is bigger and now when I run the program once again it will show the whole message hi YouTube here right so this is how you can create your first project using window builder in Eclipse IDE now in this video we will make some useful application a simple calculator to add or subtract two values which we enter in the text box so let's get started I have this blank frame here and I have taken this absolute layout inside this frame and then I'm going to take two text boxes here text box 1 and text box once again Xbox ok so I have these two text boxes first in the first text box name is text box feeling the I will name it as text box filled num1 and the second text box name I will change it as text box filled num2 okay so in these two text boxes we are going to enter our two number which we want to add or subtract okay now I will take or I will take button or two buttons one for adding so I will take this button one for adding and one for subtracting for example if you have observed when you want to draganddrop or when you want to take a same tool two times you need to just click on some other component and go on the same component once again and yet then you will be able to drag and drop the second the same component once again so in this text box I will change or in this button I will change the text of this button as ad and the second text box text as for example okay and then what I can do is I want to show the answer somewhere right so I can show it this answer in a label or a text box whatever you want so for example I want to show the answer in the text box here okay and for I will take this label to show that this is my answer so I will drag and drop this label and I will just move this and this label the text of this label is the on sir is for example and the answer will be shown in this text box okay and you can change the property of this label you can change the font size so I will give the bigger pond size and bold and let's see what kind of font family we can use any font family for example this time Stroman or okay I will take this and I want to make my own little bit bigger so now I can see this so I have three text boxes and two buttons one label which will show that what will be the answer in this text box okay I will first of all I will click this Add button so I can double click it or I can go to right click ever add event handler and action perform okay so this time I am going to double click this button and we reach to the action perform for this new button which is called add okay and in here first of all I will write a trycatch block so that user can enter any invalid number for example he may not enter a number he may enter some letter or word or something which is not valid so we need to catch that exception so that's why we need to use try catch block right so we will use a try catch block here and this is how you can write a triangle block just write try and these two curly braces and after these two curly braces you catch your exception if any exception occurs so you can catch your exception in this catch law and I'm simply showing some message in the click catch block so if our program throws any error while we are adding these two numbers I will catch the exception and I will say please enter valid numbers okay so this message dialog I have shown you in the last video how to show a message using J option pin right if you remember and in this try catch block or in this try block I'm going to write my code but above this try block what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare two numbers or yeah I'm going to declare two integer numbers so what I am going to do is I will declare two integer variables int num1 comma two and i will need a answer variable also to store the answer so i will say a ns so I have to create three variables num1 num2 and ANS so this number one we will transfer the value from the first text box to this number one so I will say num 1 is equal to so num 1 is equal to and then whenever we take the value from the text box we need to convert it this value in to the integer right from the text box we are going to get the value as a txt and we need to convert this value in the integer so how you can convert this text to integer you need to pass it so you can just write integer dot parse int and this can take a string so what you get from the first text box you can transfer it inside this pass it as an argument so our first text box name is let's see what is the name of our first text box text feel numb 1 right go to the source code and inside this parts and argument I can write text feel numb 1 dot get text right because we are getting the text okay in a same way we will transfer the value from the second text box text box feel enum to to the num2 variable write integer the parseint and this will be X field num2 okay now once we have our values from the textbooks in these two variables we can add these two numbers so we can write answer is equal to num1 plus num2 right and we can show this answer to the third text box which was this text box this text box right so we can say the text box field I will change the text box field variable name as a NS text well peel ans so we know that it's answer text field and then in our code what we can write we can take the name of this text field a and s dot set text read text and we are going to set this number in this field right so what we are going to do is we can just transfer our answer which is this one a and s answer variable to the argument or set text right so as an argument or read text in here and this will show this error because it's not our text right it's our integer and we need to convert this text to this integer to text right so to convert this integer to text what we need to do here in the text box filled answer God set text first we need to convert this answer to text field so we will do it like this this is an integer so we will write integer dot to string that's right to string and this will take this answer integer okay as an argument here like this so our code for addition will look like this this is our code first we have taken the value from the first text box to the number one variable same we have done for number two variable we added these two variable and transfer the value to the text box as an answer same we will do for the subtraction button which is minus button right doubleclick this and in this extra actionperformed of this button I will just copy this code which I have written in the last action perform of this add button and paste it into the action perform of minus button and the only change will be this this will be now right and then it will the only thing you may need to consider is this exception II it's showing duplicate parameter e you can name it as e 1 so that this e and this e doesn't clashes ok now we are going to run our program compile it and run it and hopefully it will not give any error okay so it's not giving any error and for example I want to add 5 5 5 & 6 6 6 not this one but 6 6 6 right and I want to add them the answer is 1 2 2 1 right for example I want to subtract them the answer is minus 1 1 1 right I can do it some other values or I can just give some value which is not integer for example some word or some letter and let's click this answer button it shows please enter valid number because we have added this try catch block and this is catching any error if we if the user enters any invalid number ok so this is how you can create a simple calculator using your window builder in Eclipse now I want to build from this video a small little project so that it I'm going to build this project and and I'm going to teach I'm going to try to teach every tool or component we have in here by building that project so in a way you will build a project also and you will learn how to use these components or tools also so from this video I am going to create connection to the database with this java application so I'm going to use SQLite jar that base for a connection to this GUI which we are making in Java and we are going to make a little login page in connection with this database but first of all I want to show you how you can create your database in SQLite SQLite is a server less database that means you can transfer this database from one computer to another without worrying for the connection to the server so it's not server based database it's a kind of local database which exists on one computer only ok so let me show you how you can first of all create a database I will show you the simple method there can be other method for creating SQLite database but what I find simple I'm going to show you but if you don't know about SQLite how to use SQLite what you can do is you can go to my channel which is YouTube / programming knowledge and you can find their SQLite tutorial if you are really new to SQLite database you can find those tutorials here so go to my channel which is programming knowledge and go to playlist and in here you will be able to find this playlist in here so this playlist is called SQLite database so this is the playlist which I'm talking about beginners as like tutorial and in here I have explained how you can create database query to the database and some of the basics of SQLite but in this video also I'm going to show you how you can easily make SQLite database in your computer so the easiest thing is to use Firefox as a SQLite manager so if you don't have Firefox just download this Firefox from Internet it's free if as you all know and in here in the Firefox I have the newest version of Firefox which is Firefox I think 31 so open your Firefox and click this small button here and in here you will find this different section what we are interested in is addons so click this addons here and search for the addon call SQLite and press Enter and you will find this SQLite manager 0.8.1 it's free so just click install and will be installed in your Firefox browser as plugin just restart your Firefox so I will once again restart my Firefox and now how to search for that SQLite manager in Firefox so in the older version the it was really easier to find this manager by going to the top menu but in this new Firefox you need to go to customize so just click this customize here and in here you will be able to find your ex collide manager right so just drag and drop this SQLite manager in this menu in here ok and you will be good to go and just exit customization and now you will be able to see SQLite manager here just open this SQLite manager and we are ready to create our SQLite database it's really simple to make SQLite database in this SQLite manager to create a new database you can go here and say new database and give the name of the database for example I want to create a database for employees so I will say employee what we can say employee dot r dot abase ok and this will create an extension dot SQLite it will automatically give an extension to your database AZ dot SQLite but it's not necessary that all SQLite database have the same extension they can have dot DB extension also other extension also but SQLite Manager in Firefox create the extension dot s collide so don't worry about it and click OK and now it will ask for the location where you want to save your database ok so save a location which you can locate later right so for example let's say where can I save my database I will go to user and I will go to the same workspace which I am using for this Eclipse ok you can save it anywhere it's not I mean it's not necessary that you need to save it in the specified folder you can choose any folder of your choice and you select that folder and then this SQLite database will be created there ok now in order to add tables you need to rightclick right now whenever you create this database it has 0 tables so you need to add tables so just right click this tables yeah and click create table and in here you can give create a table so for example I name my table as employee info table and here I can make the column names so the basics you can find on my playlist of my channel but I will quickly create these columns first column will be e ID second column will be name name third column will be so named both will be user name v Billy password and for example sixth will be age for now I need these columns maybe I will add more columns but for now it's okay EW will be integer data type and name will be text and surname will be text username will be text and password will be text and my age will be integer okay so I have quickly created this database and for example I say e ID is my primary key I will click OK and click yes so now I have one table created in the SQLite Manager and in this table I can add some data okay so how to add data you can just make it bigger and just go to the table and go to browse and search here and to add some data you can just go to add and for example employee ID one name is mark some surname username for example one you can give any username password also one for example and it is 35 for example okay okay so I have created added one daughter I will once again add the second data this is John some surname and user name password age 25 so I have two rows of data I have created and this is your database and what is so once you create your database and wherever you have given the location for saving this database you will find this database there so I will look for this database once again where I have saved I have saved it in workspace you can see employee dot SQLite database here right so this is the database I have created and it has some data okay now I can close this Firefox browser and I will create a new project they say I have been showing in you in the last two videos but I will create a new project for this okay so what I'm going to do is close this for now I will go to file new new project and I will name this project as company project okay and everything will remain safe same I will click Next and I will click finish so it has created me a project called company it has subfolder called sauce and some libraries okay in this I'm going to add a class so go just go to the source folder right click it and go to new and I'm going to add a class and this class I will call as SQLite connection glass so this class will help us to connect to the database and make sure this is not checked public static void main is not checked its unchecked okay so this method made this class will not contain the mean method okay this is our helper class and just click finish now you have this escalate connection class it doesn't have anything other than the class name so what we are going to do is in here we are we want to import some of the imports to connect to the database first import is import Java dot SQL dot star or asterisk whenever you use this s trick it this means that you this will be SQL right so whenever you use this asterisk after dot it means whatever class this SQL namespace or whatever have it will add all the classes related to X SQL okay and the second import is import Java X dot swing okay so we have created a to imports now I will create a method which will be a public method public static and this method will return the connection so I will say connection and the name of the method will be for example DB DB connector okay and this will take no argument and this will take we will start the method and and the matter like this so let's create global variable maybe we use this in future so just write connection gon is equal to null and do it like this and so this connection is a part of your java dot SQL class you see when you hover over this this is a part of your java dot SQL dot connection lost right that's why I have used this and this method will return the connection and first of all in the last video I've shown you how to create try catch block so just make a quick try catch block by catch and it will take exceptions so that's right exception II and if any exception occurs I will show it in option pain dot show dialogue or show message dialog right dot show message dialog okay and now I will just pass null here as a first argument and the second argument I will pass as the exception message so I will pass this II itself here okay so in this tribe block what we need to do is first of all we need to define the class for connection to the SQLite so we would write class dot for for name and this will be in the double quotes this will be orgy dot s collide dot JDBC in capital okay and don't forget to give the semicolon here so this will be like this Oh RG dot s collide dot capital JDBC and this is showing error right now because we are not returning anything but once we return the connection will not show this error so first of all let's create the connection so connection con is equal to write driver manager dot get connection and this will be the connection so in this double quotes as an argument you will run je d bc j d bc and then SQLite because we are using SQLite SQL ite and now you will give the pack of your database where your database is present so my database is present and this part so I will copy this path or what I can do I will rightclick on my database for through the property security and I will copy all the path from here ok copy all the path and I will paste it here ok and it will show error because I will show you why it will show error but first of all I need to add the name of this database also this database name is employee dot SQLite so slash back slash employ what is it doing ok so it should have this database name employee data or SQLite I will right employee data dot SQL ite okay so first of all it's showing this error when you when you write this because you need to add whenever you make your part or whenever you give your part in Windows you need to give double slashes everywhere yeah instead of single slash as a path okay and just end this like this now it will not give any error okay and once you have your connection you will return your connection just write return corner and as soon as you return something here you will be able to see that this error will go so in here also we will return null it on and now the error will go okay so this is the connection class which we will use to connect to the database okay now once we have this connection class we are ready to make the login form right so what I'm going to do is I will go to my project once again go to the subfolder called source right click it go to new and go to other and then I will choose window builder and in SQLite design and I will choose application window click Next and now I want to give the path or the name of the new class I'm going to make so this will be my login login class so I will name it as login ok and I will finish and now you will be able to see this class which is created for us right so we go to the designer and for this video we will not do much but we will just check the connection with the database okay so we will leave this as a blank but we will go to the source and we will go to the source at the top of this in login dot Java class and in here I will find the constructor for this login class which is public login and it already has this method which is generated by eclipse which is initialize method and just below this initialize method what I'm going to do is I want to call that class connection Java connection class here to check my connection so what I am going to do is I will just go at the top one you can do it here also but it's better to do just after this declaration of the frame but yeah you can do it just above this constructor which how you can find the constructor it has the same name as your class okay just find the same name as class and initialize method it has initialized method and just above that I will call this class okay so what I'm going to do is here also first of all I need to add those import which I have used in SQLite connection class so I will just copy these two imports which is import Java dot SQL and import Java X dot s swing right and I will paste these two connections here okay and now in above your constructor you can write connection connection corn is equal to null and then we will make our results set or we will make it later and this connection corn we are going to use globally so just use this one variable or I will make it as a more clear connection so you know that this is a connection to the database okay just call this connection so just copy this object from here and just ride is equal to and just copy the name of the class which is SQLite connection class write the name of the class dot all method which is DB connector method okay so this DB connector is this method if you can see here this DV connector is this connection and we can show some message here with before returning so that we know that our connection is successful so just below this connection in SQLite connection dot database just above return connection you can show this message that our connection is successful so I can write connection successful okay so what I have done in the log in class I have just called this connection class from Java dot SQLite class and I have in the constructor of this login class I have just called this connection is equal to the class which is SQLite connection dot the method in which I have connected to the database let's try to run the program it if it works or not I was rightclick and let's see if we can make this project as our main project or we can when we run it we will be able to choose this so we have this here login and connection click OK and it's saying the message Java not long last not found exception o RG dot X collide or JDBC let's see what if the error okay so I will just close this file and I will find the error and then come back so I found out the error the error is I haven't added this SQLite ODBC or JDBC jar file to my project to use this SQLite database to connect to our project with Java we need to add some jar to our project so that we can connect SQLite to the Java so to download this SQLite JDBC jar file I will put this link in the description which is HTTP colon slash slash best bit bucket dot org /x irreal /s collide JDBC ok so I will put this link in the description then you will be able to download this file and in here you know it need to go to download and in here you need to download repository so just click this button download the posit 3 and will download a folder like this so I will open this folder and in this folder you will have some charge so I will go to limb and in here will search for these jar SQLite and yeah include windows I will search for these jars now so I think I downloaded the wrong repository this is the repository but I don't find any jar file there so I will one by one download all the jar files so first of all this one and I will keep it second one and the third one I will keep it all keep and fourth one keep it if one and downloaded and sixth one and the seventh one so I will all download all these jar files and once I have these downloads I'll go to the folder where I have downloaded them so in the folder so these are all the downloads for the jar file I have here now in order to add these jar file in your project what you need to do is go to your Eclipse project in here so go to your project here and you will have this JRE system library automatically created by eclipse for you in your project so search for this JRE system library right click it and go to build path and in Bill park go to configure build path okay so once again go to this JRE system library right click build path configure build path and in here you can add these jar files in your libraries so to add those SQLite jar file just click this Add jar button and then you can browse for your jar files I think in here there is no Jenner file so I what I need to do is first of all I will just I will make new folder so what I have done I'm in source or in company itself in the project I will rightclick in my project and I will create new folder and in here I will create a folder name for example it's sources okay and I will finish so I have this folder here so what I can do is wherever my downloads are I can just select those downloads and let's see we can drag and drop these in our folder or not drag these files in this folder copy files okay and now I have all these file of jar files here now I will go to this GRE once again Gary system library right click build path configure build pot add jar in the libraries add jar and in company I have this folder resources and I can I think multi select them and click OK and once I have done that let me see if they are there or not so once I have done that I think they will be added in here these files you see so I will click OK and now these files are here they so referenced libraries ok so you will be able to see them here now once you have all these SQLite JDBC file I will run my program once again and let's see what happens and now I can see connection successful and when I see connection successful message I know that I have successfully connected to my database so don't forget to add these SQLite JDBC jar file and I will provide the link for them so you can download all the jar files from that link and just add like I have done and this message you were seeing when I than the program connection successful here if the connection if you see this line which I have created connection successful that means you are connected to the database okay once again connection successful so in this way you can create a SQLite database and connect it to our Java GUI project hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how you can create your SQLite database and connect it to your Java GUI application so I have shown you how to create a database and how to connect this database to your Eclipse web builder GUI application right so we have tested our connection like this so whenever we run the program it shows connection successful that means the connection with the database is successful okay and it opens the login page but in this login frame we haven't I mean we haven't inserted any tools or components here so in this video I'm going to show you how you can create a login page with checks the username and and password from the database so it validates username and password from the database and if there's that username and password is correct then it will give you some message if it's correct or not so let's get started first of all I will just make this window a little bit bigger by doubleclicking this login not Java and we have some space to work with now right so what I'm going to do is I will just resize this a little and I'm going to take this absolute layout and I will just place it on this login panel and I will take two labels label one and label 2 so once again label okay so I have taken these two labels and then I will take the text box text box 1 and thanks box okay so I have two labels and two text boxes and I will take a button which we whenever user clicks he will be able to login so take a button once again take a button here and now I will change the names of these labels or variables name I will leave these names for the label as it is you know how to change the name will be added variable name but I will change the text of these labels as first is user name it should be user name and the second label text will be why it goes to the so first label text will be user name and the second label text will be password right and then what I'm going to do is I remember one thing whenever you use or enter any username and password the password is always hidden it should be hidden right otherwise the other users can see your password and there is no meaning of password right so I will delete this text box because it will show my password to the other user and what I can use is this password tool so this there is a tool called J password field and this tool we specifically use for passwords so just click this and just leave it on your frame and this we use for entering the password okay so I will resize thyself yeah and this we will use for entering the password and properties of this password you can see here just click this password field and you will be able to see that echo care and you can change this echo care to any and character and this will be or your password will be maxed masked with this character so you can use dollar sign here or you can use hash or any other character and it will mask this character will mask all of your password so we have done that and I will change the variable name of this text field for username text field text field you and for example and for password this text field I will name it as password field so it's the name already suggested this the password field so I will not change the name of the field but here this I will change the text of this button as login and I will change the name of this button else BTN login okay so now we have this and maybe you can resize it so that you can see use an even password and you can you know play with the properties for this okay and now what I'm going to do is I will select this login button right click it add event handler action perform action perform and this will lead me to this login button action perform method right and inside this math heard I'm going to write a code to check the login or username and password right so first of all I will just make a try and catch block so if any error occurs when you catch the error so I will just copy the previous code for trycatch and I will paste it in action perform method and I will remove all the other code other than my trycatch blocks so I have this trycatch long so if any error will occur it will catch the any exception okay now in this try block first thing I will do is I will create a query with the database if you remember in the last video in this long in dot Java we have initialized our connection by our SQLite connection dot DB connector function so we have this connection with the database in this object which is called connection which we have created where we have created this connection let's see so this is the connection we have created right so this is an object of connection which is a Java dot SQL class connection and so if you don't recognize this just watch the last video once again okay so I'm going to use this connection once again but yeah now to the button click event or action perform event of this login button in this try block first of all what I need to do is I need to prepare a query which I want to pass to the database so I will prepare a query which is a string variable string a limit as query itself is equal to and in the double quotes and the semicolon I will write the query so what is the query I am going to power pass select Asterix or select as Strix means select all from the database table name so my table name here is employee info this I have shown you in the last video the table name and how to create a database right so selects star or s trick from your table name and then we will write a where gloss so just right where you are username so what is the name of username just as username and password right so where username username by the way SQLite is a non case sensitive language so whatever query you are passing it can be in uppercase or lowercase but Java is a case sensitive language so you cannot play with these objects and variables but yeah whenever you pass the query whenever you are building the query you can use uppercase or lowercase depending upon your priority so selects all from your table name where username is equal to question mark and password is equal to is equal to also question mark okay this is my query now I need to make a prepared statement from this query so what I will do I will write prepared statement if the spelling is correct I don't think it's correct let me see okay so we go further is equal to then what I need to do here I need to pass the query to the prepared statement right so I will make a object of this prepared statement I will name it as PST or prepared statement okay and then I will write connection which is my object which I have created in the last video which is connection object this one connection connection is equal to null right so prepared spit statement PST is equal to connection dot prepared statement and it takes my query you see here it takes the query so I'll write quani and this is the query I'm passing here so I'm passing the query to the prepared statement then I will prepare our result set but before that with this prepared statement I want to pass the values from the text boxes which the user will enter to the prepared statement so I will write p st dot set string this will be set string and this will take two arguments the first argument will be the parameter index so parameter index is what because we are using two question mark the index parameter index of username is zero and parameter index of password is one right so the index start from zero and whatever number of question mark here you have that much index view will have so the first question mark we will have the zero index and this and the second argument for this p st self string is the value which you are getting from the text boxes so go to the design view unable to okay so I will for now I will take this name which is text field un and I will get the text so I will write dot get text okay in the same way I will just use PSP get text for the password okay so PST dot set string and the index will be now one zero index for username index one for password right and the username or password field name is this one passport will not get text and as soon as you see here get text it will it's it has the line above get X that means it will not get text it will mask your password field by the mask you see get text from the password field is deprecated okay so I don't right now let's see I will use it as it is if it shows me any error I will use some other method for now I will use like this only okay so now I have these values in my query now I want our result set right so I will write result set I will name it as RS is equal to and then this result set will execute my query okay so what I can do PST which is my prepared statement this is the statement I have prepared dot execute query whatever a query I pass in that statement I want to execute that query okay so now whenever I execute this query this query will be executed and the result will be transferred to this RS object okay so in the next line what I'm going to do I will make a while loop because this RS object gives the value one by one so I will use while and close this while loop here and I will copy this RS which is the result dot and then I will write next so this will this will give me the result one by one and if you see here this method returns me boolean value that means until and unless this next is true or unten analogous we are we are getting the values from the database this while loop will go on otherwise whenever this method will be false then it will go out of the loop right okay so in this while loop what I'm going to do is first of all above this while loop I will create integer int count is equal to zero okay and this count I will in the while loop I will increase this count so I will write count is equal to count plus one you can use other type to increment this like for example count plus plus so it depends upon you right for now I'm using counting we will count plus one okay and then depending upon the count I ain't get I want to show the messages so this count I will tell you why I have done like that but I want to show the message on the basis of count first so if if this count is equal to one this will be double equal to right is equal to one then I want to show the message here I will copy this J option pain not show message dialog in the if condition and I will I will say this one user name and password is correct okay and else else if I get the count greater than 1 greater than 1 then I will say I have duplicate user and password I will explain you why I'm writing like this duplicate user in name and password and else else I won't show username and password is not correct so I will show the message username and password is not correct okay and I will also show you maybe some message like try again or whatever so why I have declared this count here is so once this query is passed and username and password it checks from on the basis of whatever I enter in these text boxes text box name for the username and Xbox name for the password and it will go it will keep the result in this RS and whenever whatever result RS this this counter will increase okay so if only if our result oh so whenever we pass the query we get the result and if we get only one result that means it has matched the username and password because we only have one result as a as a result that means it's our username and password is correct if we get no result then we say the username and password is not correct but if we get multiple result greater than 1 that means there is some mistake there there are duplicate username and password in our database ok so I will explain all these condition or I will show demonstrate all these condition one by one when I run the program but the one of the most important thing is whenever you write a query and execute of query you need to close the connection after you execute the query so after this trycatch block which you have written what you need to do is yo you your query is executed you get the result and after getting the result you need to close the connection with the database because SQLite is only providing one connection at a time okay there is a constraint with SQLite you need to make one connection at a time with SQLite database so after this try/catch block at the end of this catch block you may write finally and then and finally you can once again write try and catch catch and in here you can close the connection in the catch or in the trance re so in here I will write the exception which is which I will show you here once again this will be exception and in the try I will close the connection so I have created this prepared statement here right so how I can close the connection if I have these outside these try block because it will not make a nice MV they are in side this time block because of the localization constraint okay so now I can use this prepared statement like this and if it's not showing unhandled exception okay so let's see do it here and instead of using this you can simply do one more thing which is more easier at the end of this try block so just at the end of this tribe of and above this catch block what you need to do is you just right RS which is our result set RS which is this one result set object dot close and PST PST which is our prepared statement right PST this one dot close and what this two line will do is after executing your query they will close the connection with the database so that whenever you want to use this connection once again in the other method you are ready to use the connection and the connection is not open so these two lines take care of that now I will run the program and you see I have this database open here so I will show you what happens when this database is open I will run the program and I will say login dot Java okay first of all I will get the message connection successful that means I am I am successfully connected to the database then I have these username and password field and let's see what's there in the username and password so I have the username is equal to 1 for the first employee username is equal to 1 password is equal to 1 right so enter this username is equal to 1 ask what is equal to 1 and you see here this my password is masked with this dot symbol because I have used password field for that and I will click this login once again or I will lick click this login button and what happens Java long array out of found exception so I want to see what is this so I will pause the video and I will see what the error is and then I will come back so I found the error which I am facing so in this trycatch block if you remember I have written this query let's collect weddy then I have prepared the prepared statement which is PST then I was passing this set string here PST dots a string and I was writing the index here right so index of the text field username was 1 or 0 and index for the password for was 1 right 0 & 1 so I checked it and this index start from a 1 not 0 so this should be 1 & 2 okay so this index should be 1 & 2 not 0 & 1 so username for index username start from 1 and password will be 2 okay now when we run the program once again run the program connection successful let's see what user name we have user name one password 1 okay all right user name one password one password is masked login username and password is correct because it matches the username and password from him now suppose we enter some random username which is not there in the database okay I will just click this and now you see the message username and password is not correct try again okay I will try again so if you see here for employee ID 2 and employee ID 3 I have duplicate username and password this I have done intentionally to check whether it gives me the result duplicate the username and password so I have 4 employee ID 2 username and password and and same for employee I did three two and two username and password so i will write username password and let's see what happens I see I get to placate user name and password that means the user name and password for employee ID 2 & 3 is duplicate so they has to be changed so we have successfully created a login page using our windowbuilder GUI application in Java hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how you can add images and icons to your component and to the frame for example you want to add some icon to this login button or for example you want to add some image to this login frame how you can do it I will show you in this video so for example you want to show some image in here for the login page so what you can do is you can use this jail able to have your image inside your jlabel and I will remove the text inside this jlabel and what I'm going to do is I'm going to resize this jlabel like this according to the size of the image for example I have okay okay now what I'm going to do is in this label I want to set some image so I want to have some image post right so what I generally do is on I go to internet browser and I search for the images which are free to use images and icon which are free to use and there are lots of website which provide images which are free to use or open source and for example I will give you an example I know outside fall I can archive this as you see so many number of images and icons and you can have them or free right so for example I want to have some image for login I'll make this a little bit bigger so I will write here login and you will see some images in here so for example I will want to have this image in my login frame I can just choose this PNG you can even have the size of the image you want to have right for example you want to have 48 by 48 this size will be changed 48 by 48 ok or you can say all and this size you will get the regular size here so I want this regular size I will click the PNG rightclick it and I will say save image as and I will save this image wherever for for in whatever folder I want for example I want to say with this image here I will save it here in my pictures folder and for example I want to have the icon for and this login button ok the image I have downloaded right now is for this login frame and I want an icon here on the login button for this login button so what I can do I can search for for example ok I can and you see here ok I can and I want to resize it for example 24 cross 24 pixel and once again I can take this PNG and I can see this and I save this image as this image on my pictures folder for it for now okay now the next thing I will do is I will change the name because they are quite long so for example I will change the name of this picture else only login and I will change this picture as only okay icon okay now what I need to do is for showing this picture on this label what I need to do is I will just double click this login dot Java so I can see my package Explorer here and in my project 1 what I need to do is just right click your project what in whatever project you are in and new and just add a source folder ok so go to project new and just add a source for source folder and you need to give the name to the source folder I name my episodes folder as IMG for images ok IMG finish and now I have the source folder and now what I can do is I can go to the pictures which I have downloaded just select all these pictures drag this picture to this image folder ok drag this picture to the image folder and you will see this message click OK and now you have these pictures in side your source folder ok if you don't see this these images inside your source folder right click and refresh so now you have these pictures inside your image source folder what you need to do is next for example I go to my project wherever I have created my project generally it's in workspace and the name of the project my project name is company and in here I will go to the bin folder or you you see here we have created this image folder and in these this image we have these two images I will go to the binary folder and you see here they are copied to the binary folder also right so they are automatically copied to the binary folder I haven't copied them but when I click it refreshed they are automatically copied to my binary folder or otherwise what you can do is you can rightclick and you can you can run your project or you can just run your project once again from here and these images will be copied in your in your a binary folder here okay so once you have these images in your binary folder it's easy to use them in your jlabel so what you need to do here is now just go to I will just double click and make it bigger and go to source yeah and search for this label wherever you have created this label this label is this one which has no text here right so in here what I need to do is I need to give the part of the image and set the icon to this label this is the label I want to set this icon right so just below the Declaration of this label you can just set this icon to the label like this okay so just write image IMG is equal to new image and what what yeah so just write this these two lines leave two lines we need to use and these two in this two line what we are doing we are just declaring this image this image is a part of this java dot awp dot image this one okay so if the this image it's showing you any error just import java.awt dot star so it'll add all the awp year libraries in your system okay so go to your image and just write image IMG is equal to new image icon and inside this bracket as a parameter you need to pass this this is indicate to dis class which is login dot Java dot class dot get resources and inside this bracket we will pass the argument slash forward slash and the name of the icon so the name of the I icon or name of the image which I want to show in this label is name of the icon is login dot PNG okay so I will change this name as login dot PNG login dot PNG right and then get image okay so this line will be like this and now once you have this image from the source code you just need to pass this image in your label so just call the name of the label in my case this is the label name which is label itself dot set icon and inside the bracket just write new image icon and pass this image object here so you need to write these two lines in order to set your image and when you go to the design view here you will be able to see your image but there is a one catch you cannot resize or your image like this right so choose the image which can fit your label the resizing of image can be done but it's a long code and I in the beginning video I don't want to show this code to you so it's easier to have the image which have the same size as your label so now you have fixed this image in your label now you want to have a icon on this login button right so what you can do is you can do the same thing just go to your code and copy these two lines which I have just explained you and wherever your login button declaration is which is let's see where our login button here so we have this Login button declaration just below this you can set this image and this image was called okay image right so I will just right under the button okay dot PNG and I will go to the design view and it's not showing let's see why so why it's showing an error because I haven't changed this label name as button login so name of the button just take the name of the button and in here just paste the name of the button right so this code will be like this and don't forget to change the name of the button which is this one and I go to design view once again I will be able to see this image here okay so in this way you can add images and icons to your components hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to show you how you can open a second jframe using a first chip frame in your Eclipse GUI application so for example I want to open a second J frame for example employee info jframe whenever user has passed the login test for example username and password is correct then I want to open a second jf okay so how can I do it I will show you in this video but first of all I need a second jframe right so I need to create the second jframe so I will go to my project or I will I will go to my source folder of my project company is my project name and this is SRC with the so folder of my project I click new and go to others and in here search for window builder and search for swing designer but this time we will not select application window we will select this time at jframe application window will create a main method inside your jframe and the main method could be only one right and this jframe is a just a frame other frame so you need to choose in this swing designer jframe right so it select just a frame click next and give the name to your class I'd give my give the name to my class I'll employ employee is it correct or let's say what can mean sometimes I get confused in the spelling so once again employee info okay my class name is employing four because I am dealing with the employee database right so I want to show the employee data in the second form okay I'll name my last name accordingly and I will click finish and this will create a second poem for me which is a blank form which is called employee info dot Java you can see here I go to my design view of this class which is employing four dot Java I will double click on this blue info dot Java so I can see this and for now I will just show some message I will take a label but before that I need to have this absolute layout inside this and then I will put the label and I will just say second form for now okay and maybe I can just resize it so we will be able to see the message and maybe I will change the font size so that it's variable okay so I want to open this frame from my login train right so if you remember we have written our code to login username and so username and password validate user name and password and whenever we click this login button we will be able to see the message if the username and password is correct or not so just click this login button once again and this was the code which I have written so if you don't remember this code just see my last videos in which I have shown you how to create a login page and in here where my validation is correct where I am showing username and password is correct I want to open the new frame which is employee in full frame right and I want to close this frame ok so first of all I walk I will close this frame how can I close this frame just take the name of your cream so the frame name is frame only you see a private jet frame frame so take the name of your frame go to the condition where your username and password this correct username and password is correct I was showing there and in here frame dot dispose okay this will dispose your frame or hide your frame ok and then I will call the new class so I will create an object of the new class my class name is employee info class right so you see here I will created this new class employee info class right all right employee info I will say the object name is empl I an echo for example is equal to new employee info so I'm creating an object of this class and now I can use this object to call the set visible method which is responsible to make your frame visible so I use this object which is MP L in for God set visible and what it takes this method takes a boolean value so I want to make this true to show this frame right so whenever I use this true then this second class will be visible for me or second frame will be visible for me so you just need to write these two lines write two or three lines and once again I run the program click OK it will open error exists in required project let's see what is the error I can't see any error here it shows any error duplicate local I am G okay so this I think I have in the last video I have made showing you how to show the image and I think I have created somewhere here some image which is this I can call it image one ok now this error will not come I'll run it once again okay and connection is successful okay and use an image I need to give a username and password I will you give the username and password and when I click this login button I will see first of all this message username and password is correct and when I click OK you see I can see the second form and first form is this post that means it is gone and second form is open the same thing you can do for calling the login from form from the employee form okay so for example you want to go from this form to the previous form which is the login form you can do the same with this hello guys welcome 'once again in the last video I have shown you how to open a second form using your login form in your Eclipse Java GUI application in this video I'm going to show you how you can load your data in a J table in this second form so for example you have this data in the table in the database right I want to show all this data in my J table in my Eclipse GUI how can I do this so I will start with this video by just removing this label which I have used in the last video and now my form employee info form is blank ok so I will resize this form I will resize this form and in here I will take a button to load the table and I will take J table okay so search for J table here it is and the trick of using J table in the form is just select this J table and then make us big square here okay otherwise if you just select this table and dry select here click here then it will not be visible so select your table and make us big square okay now what I'm going to do is I will rightclick my table so I will rightclick my table and surround my table with J scroll pane okay so right click once again rightclick the table and go to surround with surround width and then surround with Java X dot swing dot J scroll pane so I have surrounded my table by J scroll pane now what I can do is I can change the name of this button has button load table or whatever you feel like and I will also change the text of this button has load employee data for example okay you can even change the name of your table but I will leave it as default so this table is inside your straw pane right so whenever you select your table you will see the scroll pin because your table is inside this roll pin right so now once you have these both things I will just double click my button and I will reach to the source code of this button actionperformed method but first of all I need to this form with the database right as I have done with login dot Java class right so we have connected this frame to the SQLite class which we have created so this employee info dot Java file also we need to connect with SQLite class and how we can do it just go to our excellent SQLite connection class and take all the import copy all the imports from here which is import Java dot SQL dot star import Java X dot swings or star and just go to your employee info form and paste these two imports here also the second thing I have done is I need to make the connection with the class so I need to declare the connection object so go to your constructor constructor of the class is the same name as your class name so just search for the method which has the same name has your class and this is my constructor just go above this and I will declare a connection to my SQLite class of for example so all right connection connection is equal to null so this is a connection object I made and this connection class belongs to that Java dot SQL dot connection class okay so you see here Java dot SQL dot connection class this class now go inside your constructor which is the same name as if class just inside and copy this connection object paste it here is equal to the name of your SQLite connection class my escolar connection class name is SQLite connection dot Java which we had created earlier a still light connection dot the connection method inside the connection class white if you have remembered now I will once again go to my load table and just click this button once again I reach to the action perform I've heard of this button click event and in here I will write the code so what I need to do is I need to write the code for this button action perform so what I'm going to do is first of all is the try catch block so I will just copy the blank try catch block from here and inside the scribe Blanc I'm going to write the code first to create the query and I will pass this query to the connection so I will write the connection where e first so string which is where is a string variable so query is equal to double quotes and semicolon and here I will pass the query which is select star from your table name my table name in my database is employee info so I will write it here select all from this employee info okay now next in the next line I will pass this query to the prepared statement so I will create a create a prepared statement prepared statement PSD is equal to then take the name of the connection object which is connection from here which we have created above so connection dot prepared statement we need to write it here so let's copy the connection dot prepared statement and just pass your query here okay so this query string will go here now we will declare a result set result set and which will be my RS variable is equal to and then PSD my prepared statement object dot execute query so this will execute the query and pass the result to the result set which is RS right now I will take the name of my table so first of all you once you have this result set you can load the table in different ways and there this will be a long task to load this table model or to convert this result set into a table model and load this so what is the easy way of doing this if you can download a glass jar file which is freely a freely available on internet and I use this class to make my model for the table using this result set so I'm going to show how you can download this class just go to your browser and search for RS XML dot jar free download okay so search for RS XML dot jar free for download and the first link you will find here is from sourceforge.net okay so go to this sourceforge.net and I will just pass or paste the link in the description so you can directly click this link and come to this site and you just need to download this RS XML dot jar and what this jar is it contains a class which helps us to convert our result set to our data model it's just like that okay once you have this RS XML jar file in your downloads here so I have this RS XML file here then what I can do is I can just go to my project Explorer here and in this in this resources folder which I have created earlier which contains SQLite JDBC or other jar file which I have downloaded earlier I can drag and drop this RS to XML in this resources folder just drag and drop there and once you have dragged and dropped there and click OK this RS to XML file will go into this resources folder now once you have this RS to XML dot jar in resources folder go to JRE system library here right click this and go to build path and go to configure build path and in here in the library tab just add a jar which is there in your resource file which is RS to XML dot jar file click OK click OK now this jar file is added to a project and you can easily use the classes from the jar file in your project once again in my button click event which is a load table button click event here I have written this code I have created a query prepared statement and passed the query to this connection prepared statement and this prepared spit statement I have executed and I have this result set in the result set right what I can do next is I can copy the name of the table my table name is let's see what is the name of the table so the table name was table here you see a table name a walls table okay so if you don't find the table name just go at the start of your class where public class declaration is there your class name extend jframe and in here you will find your table name which is table right in our case just come to your button action perform method here paste the name of the table dot add or not add but set model table dot set model if we have this and in here we will paste our model so what this jar will help us to use this result set convert our model so what we can use is DB utils this DB utils is is a class inside this RS to XML right so just hover over this and you will find or let me pause the video and see okay so this DB utils is a class inside this RS to XML jar file so I will just write this DB utils like this so just write DB utils dot result set to table model okay and this DB util first it will show an error and when you hover over this DB util so just go and hover your mouse above this error for DB util and you will see you need to import this net dot protein knit dot SQL file so just click this import here just click this and what this will do it will import this class in here so net dot whatever this is called pro te a nit dot SQL dot DB util it will import this and then your error in the button action perform will go okay so now you you have converted with the help of this class your result set a to a model which your table takes and then this result set will be converted to model and then you can run your program now I will run my program once again connection successful username and password we gave the user name and the password login successful and then I can see the second form and when I click this load table just see here what happens it says something let's see what is the error so I will look at the error SQL error SQL error for missing database okay so I know why we are facing this error I have created this connection class I think but yeah I'm doing this also so I let me find the error and I will come to you okay so I found the error my query here is wrong I have written select star form it should not be formed but from fr om okay so now I have corrected this query which is select start from it's not form but from your table name once again I will run the program and I will see this second form and when I click this load table or load employee data I see my data from the database in this table right so I will check with my original database which is this one and you can see here the data matches employee ID 1 2 3 4 name mark John Julie Peter age 35 25 30 21 you can see here 35 25 30 so I have this data in the table ok but for example for some reason you don't want to show username and password because whenever you click this button it's also showing username and password but you don't want to show it what you can do you can change the query which you have written yes select star from employee info instead of star which which query all the data instead of star just try select and whatever column you want to select for example you just want to show a ID name surname and age just select these column names just right select key ID comma name comma surname comma age for example okay select all the name separated by commas select the ID name surname and age from your table name and once again run the program and now when I load this I will only see a ID name surname and age which I have a party ID name surname and age right so in this way you can load your data in je table from your database I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait come in here subscribe and bye for now
