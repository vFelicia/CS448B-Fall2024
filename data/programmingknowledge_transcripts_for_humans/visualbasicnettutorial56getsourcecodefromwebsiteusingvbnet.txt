00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can get the source code
00:05 - of a website using your Visual Basic
00:07 - Windows Form
00:08 - application so for example I I want to
00:11 - see the source code of some website for
00:15 - example
00:16 - google.com uh generally I can see uh
00:20 - this Source Code by right clicking on
00:23 - the browser and just go to view Source
00:27 - page or view page source and it will
00:30 - show me the codee or source code behind
00:33 - the website in most of the browser it's
00:37 - the same and I'm going to show you how
00:40 - to do exactly same using your Visual
00:44 - Basic
00:45 - application so let's get started what
00:48 - I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
00:51 - text
00:52 - box and uh reach text
00:56 - box and a button
01:02 - and I'm going to reside this Rich text
01:05 - box so in this Rich text box I'm going
01:08 - to
01:09 - show the source code in this text box
01:13 - I'm going to paste or I'm going to write
01:17 - my uh website link and by clicking this
01:20 - button I want to get the source code of
01:22 - the website so let me change the text of
01:27 - this button as
01:30 - Source or get Source
01:34 - maybe get Source okay and now what I'm
01:38 - going to do is I will double click this
01:40 - button and I will reach to the button
01:42 - click event of this um button and in
01:46 - here I will first of all I will declare
01:49 - uh string varibles so I will say
01:52 - dim not here but
01:56 - about
01:58 - here then
02:03 - source
02:05 - as
02:07 - string and then I will just take this
02:13 - Source variable here and I will write is
02:17 - equal to
02:20 - new
02:23 - system do
02:26 - net dot web class
02:32 - L and I will say
02:39 - Do
02:42 - download let's see
02:46 - string and in the bracket what I will
02:51 - do I'm going to get the link of the
02:55 - website so I will take this link I will
02:59 - call copy the URL of the website and in
03:03 - the double
03:04 - codes I will paste it so give double
03:08 - codes and paste the link of the website
03:13 - okay so this is the code and then I have
03:18 - the source in this Source string
03:22 - variable now what I will do is I will
03:27 - simply write this so I will write Rich
03:31 - textbox one
03:34 - dot
03:36 - text is equal
03:39 - to my source
03:42 - variable
03:44 - okay so let's see if if it works or not
03:48 - I will run my program and I will say get
03:51 - source and it will get me the source
03:55 - code
03:56 - behind google.com what do google.com
04:00 - code.in now if you want uh the source
04:04 - code uh of different website or you
04:08 - don't want to hard code or hand write
04:12 - this website what you can do is instead
04:15 - of writing this URL you can just
04:21 - say textbox
04:24 - one dot text okay
04:30 - so whatever we write in the text box it
04:34 - will take it as a URL and then it
04:39 - will take the source of the URL which
04:43 - you have entered in
04:46 - your text box and then it will represent
04:50 - or it will show the source of that
04:53 - website in the rich text box but you can
04:58 - or user can and enter wrong URL also so
05:02 - you in order to prevent the user
05:06 - to um enter wrong URL or catch any
05:10 - exception you can just
05:12 - write try catch
05:16 - exception and you can
05:18 - just enclose your code inside your TR
05:22 - catch block and in
05:25 - the message box of the
05:28 - catch messagebox Dosh
05:32 - show and you can show any error
05:36 - message so that you know that your user
05:40 - has entered the wrong
05:46 - URL okay so now I will run the code once
05:50 - again and in here once again I'm going
05:52 - to
05:53 - take same URL or you can take different
05:57 - URL and I will say get get
06:00 - Source or if I enter the broken URL for
06:05 - example I write
06:08 - www.g google. something. C so it's a
06:13 - broken URL and I will say get
06:16 - source
06:18 - and it shows me this exception error
06:22 - right so I know that I have entered the
06:25 - wrong URL because of the TR catch block
06:29 - so it's always a good practice to
06:32 - enclose your code in the try catch block
06:35 - whenever you have the chance of uh
06:39 - having any exceptions or any errors I
06:42 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
