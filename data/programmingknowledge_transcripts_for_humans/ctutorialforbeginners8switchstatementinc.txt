00:00 - hey guys welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we'll be talking
00:04 - about switch case statement but before
00:06 - talking about the switch case statement
00:07 - I would like to talk about the
00:09 - if-elsif-else ladder so that is nothing
00:12 - but a simple implementation of the
00:14 - offense ladder itself so let me give an
00:16 - example suppose you have let me comment
00:19 - it down here you have a question like in
00:22 - the MC q kind of thing so you have a
00:24 - question and you have four options like
00:28 - this and you have a choice so I just say
00:32 - Q your choice one your choice and here
00:35 - the user can enter whatever number he
00:38 - wants and you can check whether his
00:40 - answer is correct or not so you just
00:43 - check whether the choice whether the
00:45 - choice is one or else.you again go for
00:49 - another check you check whether the
00:50 - choice is or not right and if it is not
00:55 - - you go and check for another set of
00:58 - conditions
00:59 - so if choice equal to three you have
01:02 - something to do orders again you check
01:06 - whether this choice is for or not so if
01:09 - choice equal to four and if none of
01:14 - these are two then you say good it is an
01:18 - invalid option say you do something like
01:20 - this right so this is the kind of
01:23 - implementation where you are not using
01:25 - the if-else if-else level so here you
01:29 - are using the if is slider so how do I
01:34 - make an make it as an if-else if-else
01:37 - well so what is ends if basically it is
01:40 - the same implementation just that it is
01:42 - using a rule that the else statement
01:45 - always goes with the innermost if so let
01:48 - me read it on here it's a very important
01:51 - rule so the rulers always the else
01:56 - statement goes with the innermost if
02:04 - this is a whole you need to remember
02:06 - always this is always true that the else
02:09 - statement goes with the innermost F so
02:12 - if you write
02:13 - a program like if and then you have
02:16 - asked for that sorry thanks for that and
02:20 - you have and if you have another if and
02:23 - you have an else so the hierarchy of
02:25 - this particular program is there is an
02:28 - if condition and for that you have an
02:31 - else condition so these three statements
02:33 - belong to this else condition so let me
02:35 - write it down neatly so if you have an
02:38 - if condition like this and suppose this
02:41 - phase the else is there right so inside
02:45 - this else actually so even if you write
02:47 - something like if if and else so what is
02:50 - going to happen is these three
02:51 - statements go with this else statement
02:53 - and this is if and this else are what
02:57 - are the actual if and else the actual
02:59 - contrary part that is this one but if so
03:02 - is equal to one or else you are going to
03:04 - perform any of this operations right or
03:06 - else you are not even going to look at
03:08 - them if star is equal to one you won't
03:10 - consider these options so here again so
03:14 - here if you observe there are two ifs
03:16 - right so this F is evaluated so this
03:18 - else this else always will go with the
03:22 - innermost if so what is the innermost if
03:24 - this if right so here if I have a
03:26 - condition one and here if I have
03:29 - condition to condition one is evaluated
03:33 - and condition two is also evaluated and
03:35 - only if the condition two fails so if
03:38 - this fails then this else is activated
03:41 - right so this else always goes with this
03:45 - particular if not the condition to one
03:48 - but always with the innermost F so this
03:51 - is a rule that is what is used while of
03:55 - using that if else if instead the thing
03:59 - you do is you don't actually put the
04:01 - braces but you just put a word like else
04:03 - if so that has the same meaning instead
04:05 - of these braces you are just minimizing
04:08 - it so it increases the readability so
04:10 - here if I put else F and here also the
04:14 - same thing so this if I just remove this
04:18 - and this is goes field and you have
04:22 - final else so see I did not add any word
04:26 - just that
04:27 - the same program the same braces I just
04:30 - removed the bases so now the program is
04:33 - much more readable right so if noise
04:34 - equal to one or else install is equal to
04:36 - two or else if x equal to three dollars
04:38 - if J is equal to full audience if none
04:41 - of these are gross it's anyone elses so
04:45 - now let us talk about this switch case
04:47 - statement so switch pay statements are
04:50 - not always used for all kinds of
04:54 - comparison they are actually a kind of
04:56 - alternative for the conditional
04:58 - statements but they are always not used
05:01 - switch cases are used only when we need
05:05 - to compare the Equality of two operands
05:08 - so let me write it down here's which
05:10 - cases of case on switch cases only
05:17 - compared equality so you cannot compare
05:22 - whether something is greater than or
05:24 - less than equal to or something like
05:26 - that you can just compare whether they
05:28 - are equal to or not equal to so the way
05:31 - you define switch case statement is for
05:33 - the same thing I'm going to do so let us
05:35 - write a complete program we will
05:36 - understand it so let me put this here so
05:43 - let us are very asking something so
05:47 - field
05:48 - I'll let just say enter your choice for
05:51 - naught you can add any kind of input
05:54 - form of your choice so just I'm just
05:58 - saying enter your choice and I'm going
06:00 - to enter put my choices one down the
06:04 - other so I'll start with number one one
06:08 - and again another one so let's say two
06:12 - and you have three and you have four and
06:16 - your new line and here I'll just put
06:21 - enter your choice let me give another
06:25 - new line so you can differentiate
06:27 - between your choice in the question so
06:30 - now joy is going to burn in so it is
06:32 - choice and see how sorry CN twice
06:38 - so you got your choice now in a previous
06:42 - case how we did that we just check
06:45 - whether the choices one not two or three
06:46 - you can do that actually if else if else
06:49 - if else if and this so suppose you had
06:51 - ten conditions you have nine and six and
06:54 - one if and then you have an X part where
06:57 - it is none of the choices so that's how
06:59 - it works in case of switch case it
07:02 - becomes much more easier so the way you
07:03 - do that is you just switch sorry the
07:07 - spelling Muslim switch you put your
07:09 - variable in there so what is all
07:11 - variable its choice right so Smith
07:13 - choice you have a brace and here you are
07:15 - just going to define your cases so you
07:18 - have a case and then this is just like
07:21 - comparing choice equal to some number so
07:24 - I just say case one and then you need to
07:28 - do something so let's just pray the you
07:32 - choose one something like that and then
07:35 - the most important thing and switch case
07:38 - is that you need to do something called
07:40 - Greek so we talked about this keyword
07:43 - this break is it keyword we will talk
07:46 - about that in the next video but for now
07:48 - you just remember after every piece
07:52 - after performing every statement for a
07:55 - case you need to break out of that case
07:58 - I generally do that without the basis
08:00 - but you can even put a brace over here
08:02 - so this is also correct but I generally
08:05 - don't use a brains it's okay even if you
08:08 - do so this is the same thing we are
08:11 - going to do for every case so case one
08:14 - case two case three case 4 that's all
08:16 - right so we are only 4000 and then let
08:19 - me first do that afterwards we'll look
08:22 - at the other condition so you have you
08:25 - chose to use those three you to support
08:27 - now let's suppose I did not choose and
08:30 - you know any one of them so what is
08:33 - going to happen is you are going to use
08:36 - something called the default case so a
08:38 - way you do less is you put a default and
08:41 - then you just print the invalid whatever
08:46 - the exception you wanted to print so
08:48 - invalid told something you got
08:50 - so that is how you used switch case it
08:54 - is very easy to read and this is mostly
08:56 - used in case of such menu based program
08:59 - so you have menus or you want to choose
09:01 - something or something like that so
09:04 - generally we use which cases because
09:06 - they are much easier to implement and
09:08 - that you feel so you need to write
09:10 - offense
09:11 - again and again again so this one is
09:13 - much more easier than writing the
09:15 - if-elsif-else lighter so you can even
09:18 - compare strings you can compare
09:20 - characters so characters are nothing but
09:22 - integers and you can compare boolean
09:27 - values also you cannot compare something
09:30 - relational right so you cannot compare
09:33 - whether it's some in some range or not
09:35 - if you want to compare that you need to
09:37 - go with the infinite Praetorians which
09:39 - case is going to work for you so let us
09:43 - quickly execute this program so f9 so
09:46 - here it's asking enter your choice let
09:48 - me just put two and enter so here it
09:51 - says you choose 2 so let us now look at
09:55 - what will happen if I just remove the
09:57 - split so let me just remove these three
10:00 - breaks right now once I try to execute
10:09 - it just see what happens now it's again
10:14 - asking for my choice now if I enter
10:16 - something like let's say 1 what it
10:19 - should print it shipment you 200 it was
10:22 - working in a previous time so now if I
10:24 - just put enter it says you chose one you
10:27 - chose to use those three usual school
10:29 - why did that happen because of the break
10:33 - statement so now if I don't have the
10:35 - break statement what is going to happen
10:37 - it is going to evaluate from this order
10:40 - on it is going from top to bottom so now
10:42 - if first it takes the first case and
10:46 - then if this fails it goes the second
10:47 - one if this case it goes to third one
10:49 - and when away it finds a match it is
10:52 - just going to drop down just like that
10:54 - so that brief prevents the drop down if
10:57 - you don't have a break it is going to
10:59 - put everything in that order so if I
11:02 - just remove the
11:02 - break also and suppose I tried expertise
11:06 - again so now here if I put some case
11:10 - like let's say some arbitrary number
11:12 - three so here if I press thingy now
11:15 - observe that there's no break right so
11:17 - it is going to go from three four and
11:20 - involute or there's no break in between
11:22 - so it's just going to drop down to the
11:24 - hole switch statements so just press
11:27 - ENTER it's going to say you chose three
11:29 - you just pour and then in my new church
11:31 - so that is why you need to put the break
11:34 - statement so that's all for the switch
11:36 - case and if-else if-else later in the
11:39 - next video we'll be discussing about the
11:41 - jump statements and also we will be
11:43 - starting loops
11:44 - till then happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome to programming knowledge in this video we'll be talking about switch case statement but before talking about the switch case statement I would like to talk about the ifelsifelse ladder so that is nothing but a simple implementation of the offense ladder itself so let me give an example suppose you have let me comment it down here you have a question like in the MC q kind of thing so you have a question and you have four options like this and you have a choice so I just say Q your choice one your choice and here the user can enter whatever number he wants and you can check whether his answer is correct or not so you just check whether the choice whether the choice is one or else.you again go for another check you check whether the choice is or not right and if it is not you go and check for another set of conditions so if choice equal to three you have something to do orders again you check whether this choice is for or not so if choice equal to four and if none of these are two then you say good it is an invalid option say you do something like this right so this is the kind of implementation where you are not using the ifelse ifelse level so here you are using the if is slider so how do I make an make it as an ifelse ifelse well so what is ends if basically it is the same implementation just that it is using a rule that the else statement always goes with the innermost if so let me read it on here it's a very important rule so the rulers always the else statement goes with the innermost if this is a whole you need to remember always this is

same thing so this if I just remove this and this is goes field and you have final else so see I did not add any word just that the same program the same braces I just removed the bases so now the program is much more readable right so if noise equal to one or else install is equal to two or else if x equal to three dollars if J is equal to full audience if none of these are gross it's anyone elses so now let us talk about this switch case statement so switch pay statements are not always used for all kinds of comparison they are actually a kind of alternative for the conditional statements but they are always not used switch cases are used only when we need to compare the Equality of two operands so let me write it down here's which cases of case on switch cases only compared equality so you cannot compare whether something is greater than or less than equal to or something like that you can just compare whether they are equal to or not equal to so the way you define switch case statement is for the same thing I'm going to do so let us write a complete program we will understand it so let me put this here so let us are very asking something so field I'll let just say enter your choice for naught you can add any kind of input form of your choice so just I'm just saying enter your choice and I'm going to enter put my choices one down the other so I'll start with number one one and again another one so let's say two and you have three and you have four and your new line and here I'll just put enter your choice let me give another new line so you can
