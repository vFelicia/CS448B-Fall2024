00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - OpenCV for Python on your Ubuntu
00:07 - operating system so I'm using Ubuntu
00:10 - 18.04 LTS version for this presentation
00:15 - so first of all you just need to open
00:18 - your terminal you can open your terminal
00:20 - by just pressing ctrl alt T which is
00:24 - going to open the terminal and then
00:26 - first of all you just need to type sudo
00:28 - apt update and then press ENTER and then
00:34 - give your open to Spass word I'm going
00:37 - to provide my Ubuntu's login password
00:40 - and then press enter and it's going to
00:42 - do the updates plus it's going to
00:45 - refresh the packages index so once the
00:48 - update command is successful I'm going
00:50 - to clear the terminal first of all and
00:52 - then let's give the second command which
00:54 - is to actually install OpenCV so the
00:58 - default version of Python on Ubuntu
01:01 - 18.04 is Python 3 so let's check first
01:05 - of all which version of python is
01:07 - available on my open to operating system
01:10 - so i'm going to give this command python
01:12 - - - version and then press enter and you
01:16 - will see it's going to give this message
01:19 - which says command python not found but
01:22 - can be installed with these commands now
01:26 - let's check the version of python 3 so
01:29 - just give this command which is python 3
01:31 - - - version and you will see python 3
01:36 - point 6 point 5 is available at the time
01:40 - of making this video on my open to
01:43 - operating system so that's why we are
01:45 - going to install OpenCV who are python 3
01:48 - on our open to operating system so i'm
01:50 - going to once again clear the terminal
01:53 - and then give this command sudo apt
01:56 - install python 3 - open CV ok so just
02:03 - give this command sudo apt install
02:06 - Python 3 - open CV and then press Enter
02:10 - which is going to start installing this
02:13 - package and in between you will be asked
02:15 - if you want to proceed
02:17 - just press Y and then press Enter so now
02:19 - after this installation is finished it's
02:22 - time to check whether open CV is working
02:25 - fine with our Python script so what I'm
02:28 - going to do is I'm going to once again
02:30 - clear the terminal and then I'm going to
02:33 - open the Python shell by giving this
02:36 - command Python 3 and now we are going to
02:39 - import the cb2 library which will be
02:43 - available after the installation of
02:45 - Python 3 OpenCV so I'm going to just
02:48 - write import CV 2 and then press ENTER
02:53 - and if this import doesn't give any
02:56 - error that means open CV is installed
02:59 - successfully on your Ubuntu operating
03:02 - system and now we are going to try to
03:05 - check the version of CV 2 package which
03:10 - is installed on our operating system so
03:12 - just give this command C v2 dot version
03:16 - is going to display the version of CV 2
03:18 - which is installed on your open to
03:21 - operating system which is at this time
03:24 - three point two point zero now if you go
03:27 - to the open CV website which is open CV
03:30 - dot o-r-g on its home page you can see
03:34 - at the time of making this video open CV
03:37 - 4.0 version is available but we can see
03:41 - here that version of open CV we have
03:45 - installed is three point two point zero
03:47 - so if you want to install the latest
03:50 - version of open CV for Python which is
03:53 - version 4.0 point 0 at the time of
03:56 - making this video then you can follow
03:59 - these commands which I'm going to show
04:01 - so I'm going to close this terminal and
04:04 - then I'm going to open the terminal once
04:06 - again and first of all in order to
04:08 - install the latest version of open CV we
04:12 - need to install a Python pip which is a
04:15 - package manager for Python packages so
04:19 - in order to install pip for your Python
04:22 - 3 version you just need to give these
04:25 - commands so first command
04:27 - you need to give is sudo apt update and
04:31 - then press ENTER and then provide your
04:34 - open to spaz word so once the update
04:36 - command is finished I'm going to clear
04:39 - the terminal and then gave this command
04:41 - which is sudo apt install Python 3 -
04:49 - paper and then it's going to ask you if
04:52 - you want to continue i'm going to press
04:53 - Y and then press Enter
04:55 - so now the installation of PIP for our
04:58 - Python version 3 is completed so I'm
05:01 - going to clear the terminal once again
05:03 - and now we are going to check the
05:05 - version of PIP which we have installed
05:08 - so just give this command pip 3 - -
05:12 - version and then press ENTER and it's
05:15 - going to give you the version of PIP
05:17 - which is available for your open to
05:20 - operating system so once the
05:22 - installation of PIP is finished
05:24 - successfully we are going to install a
05:26 - package called open CV - Python using
05:30 - this pip 3 command so just give this
05:32 - command pip 3 install open CB - Python
05:39 - and then press Enter which is going to
05:41 - start the installation of this package
05:44 - which is open CV - Python so once the
05:46 - installation of this package open CV -
05:49 - python is completed we are going to just
05:52 - check whether we can import the CV -
05:56 - version which is available after the
05:59 - installation of this package using pip
06:02 - so I'm going to clear the terminal once
06:04 - again and let's give the Python 3
06:08 - command to open the Python shell and
06:10 - then I'm going to import the CV 2
06:14 - package and then press Enter and if it
06:17 - doesn't give any error that means cv 2
06:19 - is available for your operating system
06:22 - and to know the version of open CV
06:24 - available for your cv 2 package you can
06:28 - once again give this command which is CB
06:30 - 2 dot underscore underscore version
06:34 - underscore underscore and then press
06:36 - enter and you can see this time
06:40 - at four point zero point zero OpenCV
06:43 - version is available for your Ubuntu
06:46 - operating system so this is how you can
06:49 - install a pip on your open to operating
06:52 - system and this is how you can install
06:54 - OpenCV for python on your open to
06:57 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
07:00 - this video and I will see you in the
07:02 - next video

it's going to give this message which says command python not found but can be installed with these commands now let's check the version of python 3 so just give this command which is python 3 version and you will see python 3 point 6 point 5 is available at the time of making this video on my open to operating system so that's why we are going to install OpenCV who are python 3 on our open to operating system so i'm going to once again clear the terminal and then give this command sudo apt install python 3 open CV ok so just give this command sudo apt install Python 3 open CV and then press Enter which is going to start installing this package and in between you will be asked if you want to proceed just press Y and then press Enter so now after this installation is finished it's

the version of PIP which is available for your open to operating system so once the installation of PIP is finished successfully we are going to install a package called open CV Python using this pip 3 command so just give this command pip 3 install open CB Python and then press Enter which is going to start the installation of this package which is open CV Python so once the installation of this

available for your operating system and to know the version of open CV available for your cv 2 package you can once again give this command which is CB 2 dot underscore underscore version underscore underscore and then press enter and you can see this time at four point zero point zero OpenCV version is available for your Ubuntu operating system so this is how you can install a pip on your open to operating system and this is how you can install OpenCV for python on your open to operating system I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
