00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:06 - you can read inputs from your terminal
00:09 - in your script so to get input from the
00:13 - keyboard you use read command the read
00:17 - command takes input from the keyboard
00:19 - and assigns it to a variable so let's
00:23 - see how we can use it so for example I
00:25 - want to allow the user to enter some
00:28 - names so I will just write for example
00:31 - first of all Echo and then I will uh
00:35 - just print some text for example
00:38 - enter names or name right and then I
00:42 - want to allow the user to enter the name
00:45 - so for that I can use a command called
00:49 - read and then whatever variable name I
00:53 - write after this read command your input
00:56 - will be saved in this variable okay so
00:59 - for example I write the variable name
01:01 - name then your input will be saved
01:04 - inside this name variable now I want to
01:07 - print this variable so I can just uh
01:10 - write Echo and then uh I can just write
01:14 - uh enter name and then the variable so
01:20 - use dollar symbol and the variable name
01:24 - as we have seen in the last video so
01:26 - let's run the script and let's see what
01:29 - happens so it asks me for entering the
01:33 - name and I enter some name for example
01:36 - Max and then press enter and then it
01:40 - says entered name is Max which is
01:43 - totally fine right so whenever you want
01:47 - to take an input from the terminal use
01:50 - read command now for example you want to
01:53 - enter multiple uh uh variables in the
01:58 - same read command you can just do that
02:01 - also so for example I want the user to
02:04 - enter multiple names so I will just uh
02:07 - edit this text to enter names and then
02:11 - instead of using one variable I can use
02:14 - for example name one and then space name
02:17 - two let me just correct name two and
02:22 - then space name three and so on right so
02:26 - whenever you want the user to input
02:28 - multiple variables just write the
02:31 - variable and then separate it by the
02:34 - space another variable separate it by
02:37 - the space and then another variable and
02:40 - to print these names you can just print
02:43 - it like you do normally for example
02:47 - names and then first name is name one
02:51 - and then comma for example and then uh
02:54 - once again name two and then comma and
02:58 - then print them variable name three okay
03:03 - so let's save the code and let's run the
03:05 - script once again and then uh enter the
03:08 - name so for entering the name for
03:11 - example I write Max don't press enter
03:14 - here just enter the second name for
03:16 - example Tom and John I I entered three
03:22 - names here right and then print enter
03:25 - and then it prints uh names and then
03:29 - whatever names I have entered here right
03:32 - now for example if you want to enter the
03:36 - input on the same line as uh you printed
03:41 - this uh Echo string on then how you can
03:45 - uh do this so for example I'm going to
03:47 - run this example once again and you can
03:50 - see it prints this string using Echo and
03:53 - then I can see the prompt on the next
03:56 - line now sometimes I want to do do it on
04:00 - the same line as this string right so
04:03 - how I can do this so let me remove
04:06 - everything here and let's say I want to
04:10 - allow the user to enter his username
04:12 - right so I can just write read and there
04:15 - is a flag called minus P or P flag which
04:20 - allows us to enter uh the you know input
04:24 - on the same prompt or same line right so
04:29 - for examp example I will just write uh
04:32 - usern name here and then I can take the
04:37 - user input for example
04:39 - user VAR for user variable right so this
04:45 - will allow me to enter the input on the
04:48 - same line right and to Echo this I can
04:52 - just write Echo and then whatever the
04:56 - username is so for example I will just
04:59 - write the same uh uh text here and then
05:02 - the variable name which is user VAR okay
05:07 - and let me uh run the script once again
05:11 - and then it asks me the username for
05:14 - example my user and then press enter and
05:17 - it prints the
05:19 - username now sometimes you also want to
05:23 - make uh this input silent silent means
05:27 - for example you want to allow the user
05:29 - to enter
05:30 - his password and uh the password you
05:33 - cannot show for example right so you
05:36 - don't want to show what the user is
05:39 - typing then you can use a flag called s
05:44 - s flag right so let me just show you
05:48 - what I mean so for with this read you
05:52 - just add a s flag and then a p flag and
05:56 - then for example this is a password okay
06:00 - so just write
06:02 - password and then uh just change the
06:06 - variable name for example pass variable
06:09 - and then we will just uh print our
06:12 - password okay so if you want you uh you
06:17 - know skip this you can skip this line
06:20 - because you don't want to show whatever
06:23 - password user have entered but this uh
06:27 - input will be silent
06:30 - and let me show you what uh I mean by
06:33 - silent is so let me run the script and I
06:37 - will uh just enter the username for
06:39 - example my user and then it asks me for
06:42 - the password I enter the password 1 2 3
06:45 - 4 5 but it doesn't show on this terminal
06:49 - but it's sto it's stored in this
06:52 - variable right so whenever you press
06:56 - enter you can see the password you using
07:00 - this line of echo command the password
07:04 - is shown here which is 1 2 3 4 5 which I
07:07 - have printed but in here I also can see
07:10 - that this line is printed on the same
07:13 - line as the password line so I for to
07:16 - solve this problem I can just write Echo
07:19 - here with no string right and let me run
07:23 - the script once again so username my
07:26 - user and password once again one 2 3 4 5
07:30 - but it doesn't show on the terminal and
07:33 - when I press enter it shows everything
07:35 - so username and password like
07:38 - this now for example you want to uh
07:42 - allow the user to enter multiple inputs
07:46 - and you want to save those input inside
07:49 - uh an array so you can do that also and
07:52 - for that you use a flag called minus a
07:57 - so let me just remove everything here
08:00 - and I will just say Echo and then I will
08:04 - just say enter names for example enter
08:08 - names and uh then I can just write read
08:13 - and then minus a which uh tells this
08:17 - script to read an array right so
08:22 - whatever variable name you give here for
08:24 - example names it will be uh like an
08:28 - array okay okay so to print those names
08:32 - I can just write Echo once again so just
08:35 - write Echo and then for example names
08:40 - and then whatever names you have entered
08:43 - so I can extract them like an array so
08:47 - to extend extract an array you can just
08:51 - uh write the variable name and the index
08:55 - of the array so for example at zero
08:59 - index X there will be a first name but
09:02 - to print this variable you just need to
09:04 - surround it by a curly bracket so just
09:08 - give a curly bracket like this and you
09:11 - can uh you know extract all the index
09:15 - like this so next will be index one and
09:19 - index two and index 3 and so on right
09:22 - for example for now I just want to
09:24 - extract uh first two uh elements of an
09:28 - array right
09:30 - so let me just run the script once again
09:34 - and name once again for example Tom and
09:37 - Max and then press enter and it shows us
09:41 - the names so you can extract those input
09:45 - as an array also using this minus a flag
09:50 - now I just want to show you one last
09:52 - trick here so for example I just want
09:56 - the user to enter name normally
10:00 - and I will just remove these inputs like
10:03 - this and for
10:05 - example I just write read here with no
10:10 - uh variable here after read command so
10:14 - what happens when you write read command
10:18 - and no variable after this so what
10:21 - happens is whenever you write read and
10:24 - without any variable after read command
10:28 - the input goes into a built-in variable
10:31 - called reply so if you uh just write
10:36 - here dollar and then
10:39 - reply then you will be able to see your
10:42 - input even without your variable name so
10:47 - the default uh variable in which your
10:50 - input goes is this reply variable right
10:55 - so let me clear the terminal Here and
10:58 - Now uh let me run the script again so
11:02 - run the script and for example I write
11:04 - some name here once again Max and then
11:08 - press enter and it prints the name
11:13 - whatever I have entered so by default
11:15 - your input goes in this built-in
11:18 - variable called reply so in this way you
11:21 - can uh read variables in your script
11:25 - using terminal I hope you enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can read inputs from your terminal in your script so to get input from the keyboard you use read command the read command takes input from the keyboard and assigns it to a variable so let's see how we can use it so for example I want to allow the user to enter some names so I will just write for example first of all Echo and then I will uh just print some text for example enter names or name right and then I want to allow the user to enter the name so for that I can use a command called read and then whatever variable name I write after this read command your input will be saved in this variable okay so for example I write the variable name name then your input will be saved inside this name variable now I want to print this variable so I can just uh write Echo and then uh I can just write uh enter name and then the variable so use dollar symbol and the variable name as we have seen in the last video so let's run the script and let's see what happens so it asks me for entering the name and I enter some name for example Max and then press enter and then it says entered name is Max which is totally fine right so whenever you want to take an input from the terminal use read command now for example you want to enter multiple uh uh variables in the same read command you can just do that also so for example I want the user to enter multiple names so I will just uh edit this text to enter names and then instead of using one variable I can use for example name one and then space name two let me just correct name two and then space name three and so on right so whenever you want the user to input multiple variables just write the variable and then separate it by the space another variable separate it by the space and then another variable and to print these names you can just print it like you do normally for example names and then first name is name one and then comma for example and then uh once again name two and then comma and then print them variable name three okay so let's save the code and let's run the script once again and then uh enter the name so for entering the name for example I write Max don't press enter here just enter the second name for example Tom and John I I entered three names here right and then print enter and then it prints uh names and then whatever names I have entered here right now for example if you want to enter the input on the same line as uh you printed this uh Echo string on then how you can uh do this so for example I'm going to run this example once again and you can see it prints this string using Echo and then I can see the prompt on the next line now sometimes I want to do do it on the same line as this string right so how I can do this so let me remove everything here and let's say I want to allow the user to enter his username right so I can just write read and there is a flag called minus P or P flag which allows us to enter uh the you know input on the same prompt or same line right so for examp example I will just write uh usern name here and then I can take the user input for example user VAR for user variable right so this will allow me to enter the input on the same line right and to Echo this I can just write Echo and then whatever the username is so for example I will just write the same uh uh text here and then the variable name which is user VAR okay and let me uh run the script once again and then it asks me the username for example my user and then press enter and it prints the username now sometimes you also want to make uh this input silent silent means for example you want to allow the user to enter his password and uh the password you cannot show for example right so you don't want to show what the user is typing then you can use a flag called s s flag right so let me just show you what I mean so for with this read you just add a s flag and then a p flag and then for example this is a password okay so just write password and then uh just change the variable name for example pass variable and then we will just uh print our password okay so if you want you uh you know skip this you can skip this line because you don't want to show whatever password user have entered but this uh input will be silent and let me show you what uh I mean by silent is so let me run the script and I will uh just enter the username for example my user and then it asks me for the password I enter the password 1 2 3 4 5 but it doesn't show on this terminal but it's sto it's stored in this variable right so whenever you press enter you can see the password you using this line of echo command the password is shown here which is 1 2 3 4 5 which I have printed but in here I also can see that this line is printed on the same line as the password line so I for to solve this problem I can just write Echo here with no string right and let me run the script once again so username my user and password once again one 2 3 4 5 but it doesn't show on the terminal and when I press enter it shows everything so username and password like this now for example you want to uh allow the user to enter multiple inputs and you want to save those input inside uh an array so you can do that also and for that you use a flag called minus a so let me just remove everything here and I will just say Echo and then I will just say enter names for example enter names and uh then I can just write read and then minus a which uh tells this script to read an array right so whatever variable name you give here for example names it will be uh like an array okay okay so to print those names I can just write Echo once again so just write Echo and then for example names and then whatever names you have entered so I can extract them like an array so to extend extract an array you can just uh write the variable name and the index of the array so for example at zero index X there will be a first name but to print this variable you just need to surround it by a curly bracket so just give a curly bracket like this and you can uh you know extract all the index like this so next will be index one and index two and index 3 and so on right for example for now I just want to extract uh first two uh elements of an array right so let me just run the script once again and name once again for example Tom and Max and then press enter and it shows us the names so you can extract those input as an array also using this minus a flag now I just want to show you one last trick here so for example I just want the user to enter name normally and I will just remove these inputs like this and for example I just write read here with no uh variable here after read command so what happens when you write read command and no variable after this so what happens is whenever you write read and without any variable after read command the input goes into a builtin variable called reply so if you uh just write here dollar and then reply then you will be able to see your input even without your variable name so the default uh variable in which your input goes is this reply variable right so let me clear the terminal Here and Now uh let me run the script again so run the script and for example I write some name here once again Max and then press enter and it prints the name whatever I have entered so by default your input goes in this builtin variable called reply so in this way you can uh read variables in your script using terminal I hope you
