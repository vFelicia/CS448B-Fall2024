00:00 - hey guys in this video we are going to
00:02 - see
00:03 - how we can install visual studio code on
00:06 - our windows 10 operating system
00:08 - and also we are going to see how we can
00:10 - set up our
00:11 - visual studio code editor for
00:14 - developing node.js applications
00:18 - so let's get started so first of all
00:20 - open your favorite browser and search
00:22 - for
00:23 - visual studio code and the first link
00:24 - which will appear here will be from
00:27 - code.visualstudio.com so we are going to
00:29 - just click
00:30 - on this link and straight away
00:33 - you will be able to see the download
00:36 - button
00:36 - here and on the top so i'm going to just
00:39 - click
00:40 - on this button which is going to
00:42 - download
00:43 - the executable file for the visual
00:46 - studio code
00:47 - setup at the time of making this video
00:50 - this file is about
00:51 - 68.9 megabytes so i will wait for some
00:54 - time
00:55 - so once this executable file is
00:56 - downloaded i'm going to just click on
00:58 - this file
00:59 - and i'm going to minimize my browser and
01:02 - now
01:03 - the visual studio setup has been started
01:05 - so i'm going to just
01:07 - check this radio button which says i
01:10 - accept
01:11 - the agreement and then click on next
01:13 - this will be the location where
01:15 - your visual studio code editor will be
01:18 - installed so if you don't have the good
01:21 - reason to change it just leave it as
01:22 - default and then click on next and
01:26 - then just click on next once again
01:29 - and now you can check these check boxes
01:33 - you can create a desktop icon for visual
01:36 - studio code let's check it
01:38 - also some other options are available
01:40 - here for example
01:42 - add open with code action to
01:46 - windows explorer file context menu i
01:48 - will check it
01:50 - this one also and register visual studio
01:52 - code
01:53 - as an editor for supported file types so
01:56 - i will also
01:58 - uh check this check box so basically i
02:00 - checked all the check boxes here
02:02 - and then click on next and then click on
02:04 - install which is going to start
02:06 - the installation of visual studio code
02:08 - and now once
02:09 - visual studio code has been installed we
02:12 - are going to see this message
02:13 - just leave this checkbox checked and
02:16 - click on
02:17 - the finish button which is going to
02:18 - launch visual studio code
02:20 - on your windows 10 operating system and
02:23 - from here you can customize visual
02:25 - studio code
02:26 - for different languages also you have
02:29 - the settings
02:31 - and key bindings for different editors
02:34 - like vim
02:34 - sublime atom and others and you have
02:38 - all these other settings from here so we
02:41 - will discuss
02:42 - them later when we
02:45 - develop some code from here let me show
02:48 - you
02:48 - some basic things about visual studio
02:51 - code
02:52 - so for example i open my command prompt
02:56 - by just typing cmd
02:58 - and then i will just navigate
03:02 - to my desktop folder
03:06 - and now i'm in my desktop folder right
03:09 - so let's say i want to open visual
03:11 - studio code
03:12 - in my desktop folder i can just
03:16 - write code here and then space
03:20 - dot which is going to open visual studio
03:23 - code
03:24 - in the current directory in which
03:27 - you are currently present so right now i
03:30 - want to
03:30 - open visual studio code inside this
03:33 - directory so just write code
03:35 - space dot and then press enter and
03:38 - when you press enter here it's going to
03:40 - open
03:41 - visual studio code and you can see
03:44 - the folder which is opened here is
03:48 - the desktop folder right so
03:52 - this is the command if you just
03:55 - type code here then it's going to open
03:58 - the folder which you are working on
04:01 - the last time when you closed your
04:04 - visual studio code
04:05 - right so we opened last time
04:09 - this desktop uh folder that's why
04:12 - when you just type code then it's going
04:15 - to just open the
04:16 - last opened folder and
04:19 - close this terminal also so now let's
04:22 - say i will go to
04:24 - my documents folder and here i will
04:27 - create a new folder and i will
04:31 - name it as workspace
04:34 - so i will just name it as workspace here
04:38 - and then i will go inside this workspace
04:41 - folder
04:41 - and then i will press my shift key
04:44 - on my windows operating system so press
04:48 - shift key and then right click inside
04:51 - this folder so press shift key and then
04:54 - right click and you will be able to see
04:57 - open
04:57 - with code option here so you can just
05:00 - choose this option
05:01 - which is going to open your visual
05:04 - studio code
05:05 - in the workspace directory now let's try
05:08 - to create a very basic
05:10 - javascript file here so i'm going to
05:12 - just click on this icon which says new
05:14 - file
05:15 - and then i'm going to name my file as
05:19 - hello dot js and here we can write
05:23 - our code for example i'm going to just
05:26 - write const and
05:29 - i'm going to name my variable as
05:33 - x let's say and then i'm going to
05:36 - give some value to it okay and then i'm
05:38 - going to provide semicolon
05:40 - and i just want to print uh the value of
05:43 - this
05:44 - variable which is x so i can just uh
05:47 - write console dot log
05:50 - and then i will just pass x inside
05:54 - these parentheses so you might have
05:57 - observed that visual studio code already
05:59 - comes
06:00 - with the support for javascript
06:03 - and node.js so you can see at the bottom
06:06 - it recognizes
06:07 - the file type and when i type
06:11 - let's say console here it gives me the
06:14 - intellisense
06:16 - for completing this code which i'm
06:20 - writing right so it knows uh the
06:23 - file name and it knows what
06:26 - i'm trying to do inside this file
06:30 - i can press ctrl s to save my file
06:34 - now you can open the terminal
06:37 - inside the visual studio code itself so
06:40 - you don't need to
06:41 - type cmd to open the command prompt and
06:44 - execute this code i can just click on
06:47 - terminal
06:48 - and then click on new terminal which is
06:50 - going to open
06:51 - the terminal in my visual studio code
06:55 - itself
06:56 - and it's going to open the terminal in
06:59 - the directory
07:00 - in which i am currently working
07:03 - so this is the workspace directory
07:06 - now one more cool feature about visual
07:09 - studio code is you can see
07:11 - that this font size is little bit
07:15 - smaller
07:16 - so i can just press ctrl and then plus
07:20 - and what it does is basically it's going
07:22 - to increase
07:24 - the font size and the size of all the
07:27 - widgets inside visual studio code so
07:30 - i can once again press ctrl plus
07:34 - and you can see now this font size is
07:37 - bigger
07:37 - terminal size is also bigger so
07:41 - in this way you can change the font size
07:44 - if you want to reduce
07:45 - the size then press ctrl minus
07:48 - okay so when you press ctrl minus then
07:51 - it's going to reduce
07:52 - the size of all the widgets and the font
07:55 - now we have already installed node.js
07:58 - on our windows operating system so what
08:00 - we can do is we can
08:02 - just write node and the name of the file
08:05 - which is
08:05 - hello dot js and then press enter and
08:08 - it's going to print the value of
08:10 - x which is my first app so you can
08:14 - write your code run your code
08:17 - within your visual studio code so you
08:20 - don't have to leave
08:21 - visual studio code to run your
08:23 - applications now visual studio code have
08:26 - some really cool uh features for example
08:29 - you can search for
08:31 - some text inside several files
08:35 - let's say i just want to search for my
08:38 - if my project contains
08:40 - many file let's say 100 files then it's
08:42 - going to search
08:43 - for my keyword in all the 100 files and
08:47 - it's going to show me the result
08:49 - right so i can see here
08:53 - my keyword is written
08:56 - so it's search and show me i can also
08:59 - replace
09:00 - my with any other word let's say hover
09:03 - and then press on this replace
09:06 - all button which is going to just
09:09 - replace
09:10 - this my with our keyboard let's see now
09:12 - visual studio
09:13 - also have a good integration with source
09:17 - control so
09:17 - if you have git installed it's going to
09:20 - recognize
09:21 - that you have get installed and it's
09:23 - going to show you
09:24 - if you want to commit your files or you
09:28 - have some
09:28 - uncommitted files so whenever you change
09:31 - your code in your project
09:33 - git is going to track your code
09:36 - and with the help of this source control
09:40 - section you will be able to see what all
09:43 - files are added or what or
09:47 - for all files are uncommitted so you can
09:49 - commit them
09:50 - and you can push them from this section
09:54 - you also have the debug option so visual
09:57 - studio comes
09:58 - with the debugger for node.js already
10:02 - so you can see to customize and run
10:04 - debug
10:05 - create a launch dot json file
10:10 - so when you just click on the run
10:13 - and debug button you will see
10:16 - that it's going to give us the option
10:20 - to choose from these
10:23 - uh options we want to debug this
10:27 - for node.js so i can just select node.js
10:30 - from here
10:32 - and then our code is going to be
10:35 - debugged
10:35 - inside our visual studio code so right
10:39 - now
10:39 - it just prints our first app which is
10:43 - uh this value of x let's say i just want
10:46 - to
10:47 - uh create a break point here
10:50 - so here on the console log i just
10:53 - created a
10:54 - breakpoint and whenever you create a
10:57 - breakpoint
10:58 - in your file you will track
11:01 - all your breakpoints under this section
11:04 - so
11:05 - if you have multiple breakpoints you can
11:08 - see what all files contain breakpoints
11:11 - and when you click
11:12 - on this you will directly go to the
11:16 - breakpoint you also have
11:18 - toggle active breakpoint which means
11:21 - that you can disable all the
11:24 - active breakpoints using this option
11:27 - also you can remove all the
11:30 - breakpoints using this option now once
11:33 - again
11:34 - let's debug our code so i'm going to
11:37 - just press run and debug and then once
11:41 - again choose
11:43 - node.js and once i do this
11:46 - you can see here because i have
11:50 - created a breakpoint here my code
11:53 - execution is stopped
11:54 - at my break point and here i can
11:58 - visualize the local variables
12:02 - and other stuff right so when i hover
12:06 - over
12:06 - on x i can see the value of x
12:10 - which is the feature available
12:13 - using the node debugger also
12:16 - if your code contains multiple lines
12:19 - you can press on this button to continue
12:24 - you can press this option for stepping
12:26 - over
12:27 - you can go or step into the code
12:30 - you can step out of the code and also
12:33 - you can restart your
12:35 - debugger using this button and you can
12:38 - stop debugging
12:40 - using this button right so these all
12:43 - things we are going to see
12:45 - uh in the later videos when we write
12:47 - some
12:48 - actual code but i just want to show you
12:51 - how powerful this visual studio editor
12:55 - is right the last section here
12:58 - is for the extensions so whatever
13:01 - language you are working in
13:04 - visual studio code have extension for
13:08 - most probably everything because it has
13:11 - a very strong
13:12 - community support let me just top the
13:15 - debug
13:16 - debugger so as i said visual studio code
13:20 - already comes with the support for
13:22 - node.js
13:23 - but if you want to search some more cool
13:26 - extensions
13:27 - related to node.js you can just type
13:30 - node
13:30 - here and then it's going to give you
13:34 - some options related to the node.js so
13:37 - let's say
13:38 - i just press on this option which says
13:40 - node debug
13:41 - and you can also see how many stars
13:46 - this project have and how many downloads
13:50 - this extension have and here you will be
13:53 - able to get
13:53 - more information about this
13:57 - extension so you can see this extension
14:00 - is from microsoft and it has been
14:04 - downloaded
14:05 - around 200 000 times and it has
14:08 - good rating of five right so you can
14:11 - decide
14:13 - based upon this if you want to download
14:16 - this extension or not so by default
14:19 - uh visual studio code comes with node
14:22 - debug extension that's why i can disable
14:27 - this from here let's say if i choose
14:29 - some other extension i have the option
14:31 - to install it
14:33 - so i can just click on install
14:36 - which is going to install this extension
14:39 - inside my visual studio code
14:41 - i can uninstall this extension and
14:44 - also i can disable this extension if i
14:47 - have installed
14:48 - the extension so there are many cool
14:51 - extensions
14:52 - here but we will install them whenever
14:55 - we
14:56 - need them right so we will go step
15:00 - by step and we are going to install them
15:02 - step by step
15:03 - when we need these extensions
15:07 - so this is how you can download and
15:09 - install visual studio code and set up
15:11 - your node.js development environment on
15:15 - visual studio code
15:17 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
15:18 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video we are going to see how we can install visual studio code on our windows 10 operating system and also we are going to see how we can set up our visual studio code editor for developing node.js applications so let's get started so first of all open your favorite browser and search for visual studio code and the first link which will appear here will be from code.visualstudio.com so we are going to just click on this link and straight away you will be able to see the download button here and on the top so i'm going to just click on this button which is going to download the executable file for the visual studio code setup at the time of making this video this file is about 68.9 megabytes so i will wait for some time so once this executable file is downloaded i'm going to just click on this file and i'm going to minimize my browser and now the visual studio setup has been started so i'm going to just check this radio button which says i accept the agreement and then click on next this will be the location where your visual studio code editor will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and then click on next and then just click on next once again and now you can check these check boxes you can create a desktop icon for visual studio code let's check it also some other options are available here for example add open with code action to windows explorer file context menu i will check it this one also and register visual studio code as an editor for supported file types so i will also uh check this check box so basically i checked all the check boxes here and then click on next and then click on install which is going to start the installation of visual studio code and now once visual studio code has been installed we are going to see this message just leave this checkbox checked and click on the finish button which is going to launch visual studio code on your windows 10 operating system and from here you can customize visual studio code for different languages also you have the settings and key bindings for different editors like vim sublime atom and others and you have all these other settings from here so we will discuss them later when we develop some code from here let me show you some basic things about visual studio code so for example i open my command prompt by just typing cmd and then i will just navigate to my desktop folder and now i'm in my desktop folder right so let's say i want to open visual studio code in my desktop folder i can just write code here and then space dot which is going to open visual studio code in the current directory in which you are currently present so right now i want to open visual studio code inside this directory so just write code space dot and then press enter and when you press enter here it's going to open visual studio code and you can see the folder which is opened here is the desktop folder right so this is the command if you just type code here then it's going to open the folder which you are working on the last time when you closed your visual studio code right so we opened last time this desktop uh folder that's why when you just type code then it's going to just open the last opened folder and close this terminal also so now let's say i will go to my documents folder and here i will create a new folder and i will name it as workspace so i will just name it as workspace here and then i will go inside this workspace folder and then i will press my shift key on my windows operating system so press shift key and then right click inside this folder so press shift key and then right click and you will be able to see open with code option here so you can just choose this option which is going to open your visual studio code in the workspace directory now let's try to create a very basic javascript file here so i'm going to just click on this icon which says new file and then i'm going to name my file as hello dot js and here we can write our code for example i'm going to just write const and i'm going to name my variable as x let's say and then i'm going to give some value to it okay and then i'm going to provide semicolon and i just want to print uh the value of this variable which is x so i can just uh write console dot log and then i will just pass x inside these parentheses so you might have observed that visual studio code already comes with the support for javascript and node.js so you can see at the bottom it recognizes the file type and when i type let's say console here it gives me the intellisense for completing this code which i'm writing right so it knows uh the file name and it knows what i'm trying to do inside this file i can press ctrl s to save my file now you can open the terminal inside the visual studio code itself so you don't need to type cmd to open the command prompt and execute this code i can just click on terminal and then click on new terminal which is going to open the terminal in my visual studio code itself and it's going to open the terminal in the directory in which i am currently working so this is the workspace directory now one more cool feature about visual studio code is you can see that this font size is little bit smaller so i can just press ctrl and then plus and what it does is basically it's going to increase the font size and the size of all the widgets inside visual studio code so i can once again press ctrl plus and you can see now this font size is bigger terminal size is also bigger so in this way you can change the font size if you want to reduce the size then press ctrl minus okay so when you press ctrl minus then it's going to reduce the size of all the widgets and the font now we have already installed node.js on our windows operating system so what we can do is we can just write node and the name of the file which is hello dot js and then press enter and it's going to print the value of x which is my first app so you can write your code run your code within your visual studio code so you don't have to leave visual studio code to run your applications now visual studio code have some really cool uh features for example you can search for some text inside several files let's say i just want to search for my if my project contains many file let's say 100 files then it's going to search for my keyword in all the 100 files and it's going to show me the result right so i can see here my keyword is written so it's search and show me i can also replace my with any other word let's say hover and then press on this replace all button which is going to just replace this my with our keyboard let's see now visual studio also have a good integration with source control so if you have git installed it's going to recognize that you have get installed and it's going to show you if you want to commit your files or you have some uncommitted files so whenever you change your code in your project git is going to track your code and with the help of this source control section you will be able to see what all files are added or what or for all files are uncommitted so you can commit them and you can push them from this section you also have the debug option so visual studio comes with the debugger for node.js already so you can see to customize and run debug create a launch dot json file so when you just click on the run and debug button you will see that it's going to give us the option to choose from these uh options we want to debug this for node.js so i can just select node.js from here and then our code is going to be debugged inside our visual studio code so right now it just prints our first app which is uh this value of x let's say i just want to uh create a break point here so here on the console log i just created a breakpoint and whenever you create a breakpoint in your file you will track all your breakpoints under this section so if you have multiple breakpoints you can see what all files contain breakpoints and when you click on this you will directly go to the breakpoint you also have toggle active breakpoint which means that you can disable all the active breakpoints using this option also you can remove all the breakpoints using this option now once again let's debug our code so i'm going to just press run and debug and then once again choose node.js and once i do this you can see here because i have created a breakpoint here my code execution is stopped at my break point and here i can visualize the local variables and other stuff right so when i hover over on x i can see the value of x which is the feature available using the node debugger also if your code contains multiple lines you can press on this button to continue you can press this option for stepping over you can go or step into the code you can step out of the code and also you can restart your debugger using this button and you can stop debugging using this button right so these all things we are going to see uh in the later videos when we write some actual code but i just want to show you how powerful this visual studio editor is right the last section here is for the extensions so whatever language you are working in visual studio code have extension for most probably everything because it has a very strong community support let me just top the debug debugger so as i said visual studio code already comes with the support for node.js but if you want to search some more cool extensions related to node.js you can just type node here and then it's going to give you some options related to the node.js so let's say i just press on this option which says node debug and you can also see how many stars this project have and how many downloads this extension have and here you will be able to get more information about this extension so you can see this extension is from microsoft and it has been downloaded around 200 000 times and it has good rating of five right so you can decide based upon this if you want to download this extension or not so by default uh visual studio code comes with node debug extension that's why i can disable this from here let's say if i choose some other extension i have the option to install it so i can just click on install which is going to install this extension inside my visual studio code i can uninstall this extension and also i can disable this extension if i have installed the extension so there are many cool extensions here but we will install them whenever we need them right so we will go step by step and we are going to install them step by step when we need these extensions so this is how you can download and install visual studio code and set up your node.js development environment on visual studio code i hope you've enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
