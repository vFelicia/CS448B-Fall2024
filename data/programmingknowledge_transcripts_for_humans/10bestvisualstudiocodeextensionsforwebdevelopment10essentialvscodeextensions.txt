With timestamps:

00:01 - hello there and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge so in today's video I will be
00:06 - showing you the top ten most used my
00:09 - personal favorite we ask for extensions
00:11 - which I use for my daily personal web
00:14 - development uses so let's get started so
00:17 - in here I have three files this is a
00:19 - simple web application that is to do a
00:23 - to-do list application in which you can
00:25 - add the tasks and at the end of the day
00:29 - when you are when you achieve those
00:31 - tasks you can just write them out so
00:34 - let's go to our extension tab and here I
00:37 - have searched for material theme just go
00:39 - inside the material theme and then you
00:41 - can see here this is the most epic time
00:43 - theme now so we can just set color theme
00:46 - and here you can see the most different
00:48 - uses choices we have this is material
00:50 - theme then we have high contrast then we
00:53 - darker darker high contrast then the
00:56 - pure light so P light is very much
00:58 - popular these days and then we have
01:01 - failed my high contrast then we have
01:03 - also ocean ocean high contrast and
01:05 - lighter or lighter is very harsh on our
01:09 - eyes so my person said it is pale light
01:13 - high contrast
01:17 - and then when you open the application
01:19 - you can see the theme how it looks then
01:23 - one more thing we have material icon
01:25 - theme so as you can see in our editor we
01:28 - have all the files like JavaScript style
01:30 - or chases and there are no particular
01:32 - icons for that so you can go in
01:34 - extension and we can choose material
01:36 - icon theme and just you stall it say
01:39 - installing when it does get installed it
01:46 - will ask for activating so click on
01:48 - activate and it is activated now let's
01:51 - go back to our editor and you can see
01:57 - okay we had we were asked let's go back
02:02 - to the Christiansen tab and we go for
02:05 - icon set far icon theme really we have
02:09 - to select what is icon theme in Mouse
02:12 - you go back to our editor you can see we
02:14 - have HTML file for two wrote HTML then
02:17 - style dot stays as we have says is three
02:19 - icon and also custom dot J's we have
02:22 - JavaScript icon so if we have different
02:24 - files like Android or angular or react
02:29 - you will get all the icons for that
02:31 - files also here in and also on top of
02:34 - the files next extension which I want to
02:38 - show you is prettier so what it does is
02:45 - it formats your code and it's like code
02:48 - formatter which gives you a consistent
02:50 - style by parsing your code and
02:53 - reprinting it with your hones with its
02:55 - own rules that take maximum line length
02:57 - into account
02:57 - reppin code when necessary so there is a
03:00 - particular setting in this which we will
03:01 - use so that is format on sale so what
03:05 - will this do it will automatically
03:08 - format the code when we hate save you
03:10 - can go to settings so you can hit
03:13 - control comma or a command comma so here
03:17 - we've got our settings and in here
03:19 - search for format on save
03:25 - so we have to take this because by
03:30 - default is not it and that will be it so
03:34 - when we change the code for example
03:38 - let's mess up the our JavaScript file so
03:42 - in this if you give some spaces like
03:45 - this and then when you hit command
03:52 - yes that is save to automatic format it
03:54 - for you so this is what the prettier
03:58 - does you can go through more of this
04:02 - documentation like what you want so
04:06 - everything you will be getting in the
04:08 - documentation of the
04:10 - so let's look at one more plug-in that
04:14 - is bracket bracket pair polarizer so so
04:23 - we have record-player colorizer and
04:25 - bracket paralyzer too so we will choose
04:28 - this one because it increases the speed
04:32 - and accuracy then the version 1 and this
04:36 - new version was with is because settings
04:37 - were cleaned up breaking backwards
04:39 - compatibility so we just install this
04:45 - now you can see it is installed so this
04:48 - extension is for colorizing the matching
04:51 - brackets so let's let's open our
04:53 - javascript file and here you can see we
04:57 - have curly braces and you can see the
05:00 - block of code he is bounded by a box of
05:05 - yellow color and the same way you can go
05:07 - for other functions too like this is for
05:13 - the inside function and if you go inside
05:15 - that you can see and it also matches the
05:18 - color of the bracket so we have pink and
05:20 - pink then yellow for ello and bounce it
05:23 - by a yellow color box so this is very
05:27 - useful when you are coding and the next
05:31 - extension I wanna show you is rainbow
05:34 - indent so that is indent rainbow and it
05:40 - gives rainbow colors for the indentation
05:45 - so it helps you for indenting so let's
05:49 - just you stall it and it's now
05:52 - installing and it is simply extension to
05:54 - make indentation more readable here you
05:57 - can see the example code here it first
05:59 - uses yellow then green then pink them to
06:04 - the top cream so let's go in this core
06:07 - you can see we have yellow and then we
06:10 - have a different color that is dream
06:13 - like that so it is helpful when you are
06:16 - writing a lot of code so if I indent it
06:20 - like this give me another color
06:25 - so this is the use case of the Indian
06:27 - train book
06:28 - now these was a visual extension so we
06:32 - will now look at the functional
06:33 - extension so first one is Auto rename
06:36 - tech so we install this so what this
06:45 - will do is when you change the starting
06:48 - tag shutting HTML to it well so change
06:52 - the ending HTML tag so you don't need to
06:55 - go down the block and change the other
06:57 - tech so it saves time when you are going
07:00 - through a lot of big code bases so for
07:04 - example I will give me here if we change
07:06 - let's see if it is install the IDS
07:09 - install so let's change this one like do
07:11 - we'll make it span and if you make it
07:15 - spam here also you can see the span is
07:17 - created if you if you make it as do
07:20 - ultimately this will also be made as
07:22 - view so this saves time and is very
07:25 - helpful for the web developers the next
07:29 - extension is rest client just search for
07:33 - it in the extension tab and here we get
07:36 - it so install it so it's very helpful
07:42 - for any front-end guy or back-end
07:44 - developer so when you are working with
07:47 - API so when you want to see what
07:50 - response of the API is you can get that
07:54 - response using this extension in the vs
07:58 - code itself so usually you use a program
08:03 - called postman for doing registry API
08:05 - stuff and that is extra program but the
08:10 - benefit of using this - plan tip
08:13 - extension is that everything is done in
08:16 - the vs code only so I will show you how
08:18 - to do it so it is now installed so let
08:21 - me go in my files so I will create a new
08:24 - file here called request dot HTTP so now
08:33 - I will type request so yes
08:36 - type get requests and we're gonna use
08:38 - the JSON placeholder so we'll type HTTP
08:44 - JSON place holder dot type co.com
08:49 - slashed posts and now I will just close
08:54 - the sidebar so for that we can use
08:56 - command B or control B on Windows and
08:59 - Mac so here you can see a button is
09:02 - popped up called send requests so just
09:04 - click on that and it will create a new
09:06 - window let's wait for that so a response
09:10 - we received so we are getting our header
09:14 - so we had 200 okay so you can see
09:19 - Jason's file so just this old or returns
09:23 - one hundred one hundred post and you can
09:26 - see the title the body of the post and
09:28 - user ID so this is an easy way to touch
09:34 - the stuff with the backend API is so you
09:37 - can have multiple pull requests in here
09:40 - so so you want to separate them you can
09:43 - use triple hash and then you can we can
09:48 - send a post request and we type the same
09:52 - code is HTTP JSON placeholder dot
09:59 - tiptip' code comm slash post and we set
10:05 - the content type application says on I
10:11 - will send data will include our title
10:18 - will say new post and then the body
10:32 - we'll say this is new post so if you
10:42 - send a request again
10:43 - so we'll get a 201 created and now you
10:52 - can see ID 1 0 1 new post is new post
10:55 - created and we had 200 IDs earlier and
11:03 - now it is 101 and this is an easy way to
11:07 - test and work with the backend API so
11:10 - this whole next extension is let's go an
11:14 - extension tab and search for CSS tweak
11:18 - so this extension allows you to pick the
11:23 - CSS definitions from your HTML files
11:25 - only so you don't need to go to CSS
11:27 - definitions in the CSS files so let's
11:30 - just install it ok so now this extension
11:32 - is installed so this is very helpful if
11:35 - you have a large CSS files and it is
11:37 - very hard to search through the suit
11:40 - through them then you can use just hit
11:42 - ctrl like let's go in our HTML file and
11:46 - if we have a class like this then you
11:49 - have to just hit ctrl and horror around
11:54 - it then you can see the peak definition
11:58 - and it will just open a window here and
12:01 - in here you can just change directly the
12:04 - CSS definition without opening the CSS
12:08 - files so if you're on Windows you can
12:13 - just you can just hit control and hover
12:15 - over it and if you're on the Mac you can
12:17 - just hit option and then f12 to get this
12:21 - window and you can change let's say
12:24 - float you change the color let's make it
12:28 - like 7 7 5 now the color is changed if
12:34 - you want to change the font size to 20
12:37 - you can also change without opening the
12:39 - CSS file and you can just save it let's
12:45 - go
12:46 - taursus HTML file so how this works is
12:50 - let me just show you
12:51 - f12 so we got this one we change
12:56 - whatever you want to change 21 then you
12:59 - say old and then we just close this
13:01 - window and now our code is edited so
13:04 - this is very helpful and speeds up the
13:05 - process and then that which happens to
13:09 - have a multiple definition it will tell
13:11 - you to click to show and you will stay
13:15 - in the same HTML file and it will pop-up
13:17 - window where we can make altercation
13:20 - here and there and then after that we
13:24 - can just close the window so this is
13:26 - very helpful if you have large projects
13:28 - and we have a large lots of sizes the
13:31 - class is and you want to change it over
13:33 - the flow fly so this extension helps you
13:36 - to edit your HTML and CSS much quicker
13:38 - so the next extension is HTML CSS
13:45 - support so what this does it it helps
13:53 - you for providing the class completion
13:56 - to HTML files we have to install this so
14:04 - let me show you a demo so let's go in us
14:06 - our CSS file in the end we'll create a
14:09 - new class so we type dot demo then CSS
14:18 - and then we will make try something new
14:21 - so I am making it making the CSS class
14:25 - name little bigger so that we don't need
14:27 - to type it again and again and inside
14:32 - this will give color equal to red okay
14:40 - so now I just save it and go in the HTML
14:43 - file so in HTML file what you can do is
14:48 - it can just call the do using omit so we
14:53 - use the demo CSS
14:59 - try something name has come here just
15:02 - hit tab and then wait and then you can
15:06 - just type control space and we give you
15:09 - the mi deprivation just enter then you
15:13 - can see our du class with the new demo
15:15 - senses try something name has been
15:17 - created and you don't need to type all
15:18 - this manually so this is very helpful
15:21 - for auto completion of classes from CSS
15:24 - to HTML files so next extension is live
15:28 - SAS compiler so let's go in the
15:31 - extension tab in just in solid lab says
15:35 - compiler so what this does it it
15:38 - basically compiles SAS into CSS so for
15:42 - this you have to have some settings
15:45 - turned on so what you can do is you can
15:48 - eat ctrl + comma or command + comma if
15:52 - you are Mac so now you are on let's see
15:56 - now you're in settings so if you search
15:58 - for SAS you can see all the settings so
16:06 - click on labs has come love live SAS
16:08 - compiler here so in here going editing
16:13 - settings JSON and in here you might need
16:16 - to add some settings so I will just give
16:18 - you some settings here
16:20 - so this would be it just add these
16:24 - settings here this would be enough for
16:29 - you so it depends on which environment
16:33 - you are working on if you're in
16:34 - production environment you can just set
16:37 - this format equals to compressed and
16:40 - your extension name to dot mean dot CSS
16:50 - it's going to minify and compress
16:53 - automatically your CSS files so you can
16:57 - say path so my personal preference would
17:00 - be under the dis directory distribution
17:03 - directory I would be having the CSS so
17:06 - my all the JavaScript CSS and HTML files
17:10 - will be present in the dist folder and
17:12 - all my sass file will be in the root
17:15 - directory in the root that is outside
17:18 - the distribution folder so all those
17:20 - files are dot s CSS that is a sass files
17:24 - so the last settings we had it generate
17:27 - map so what it does 8 so by default it
17:32 - creates a map file which I never have I
17:34 - had needed to use so I said that to
17:38 - false and so that it's so unless file
17:41 - you have tricks then you have to Co
17:43 - settings and you can just close it I
17:45 - will just demonstrate sass and in my in
17:52 - the root directory what I was gonna do
17:55 - is a create a new folder as yes CSS
18:01 - folder and within that folder I said my
18:07 - file as mean dot s c SS and then we will
18:16 - just create some basic SS s here so we
18:19 - type body
18:29 - Jean as zero padding ed zero then I'm
18:38 - gonna I'm gonna just Nash so I'll call
18:41 - each one and just add color as blue so
18:56 - this is thought so this is not normal
18:59 - CSS this is says nesting so I'm gonna
19:03 - save it and nothing would happen because
19:05 - we have to create watch first so what we
19:09 - can do is we go in output
19:16 - ok click on watch SAS and now I can see
19:20 - our output is it is watching our draw
19:23 - test surface fires and you can see our
19:26 - institution folder is created which
19:28 - minified CSS and also the map file so if
19:32 - you open with the minified CSS it is it
19:36 - has created the minified version of CSS
19:39 - file so we look at the next extension so
19:42 - it is live server so we can go in the
19:47 - extension tab and we'll add by server so
19:55 - this again by 3 T so we have already
19:58 - installed it
20:06 - so what this basically does it it
20:10 - creates a local development server with
20:13 - live load features so you don't need to
20:16 - say every time any changes you make to
20:18 - the CSS files or your HTML files hitting
20:22 - the refresh button again nothing so it
20:24 - will automatically refresh the web pages
20:28 - whenever you save something so this is
20:32 - very helpful when you're creating a
20:33 - website and let's go on over HTML file
20:36 - so I will remove what I did it earlier
20:39 - and in here you can see we have a button
20:44 - in the town s go live if you click on
20:47 - that to create a chrome window and here
20:52 - you can see our HTML file is loaded here
20:58 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
21:00 - show you okay so I will just close this
21:05 - sidebar and I'm going to add let's say
21:11 - one more paragraph tag here so just add
21:15 - up T inside that just passed Thorin and
21:21 - then when we hit save automatic we can
21:25 - see it is lav loaded and all the
21:28 - paragraph text we are added it is
21:30 - present here shown in the web
21:33 - application so we don't need to hit
21:36 - refresh button again again so this is
21:39 - very helpful tool to speed up your
21:41 - website development workflow so if you
21:45 - are wondering what this application is
21:47 - it is very simple to do list application
21:50 - created using javascript so if you want
21:52 - to type like buy groceries you can just
21:59 - add it and to come down here and
22:03 - whenever we have completed two tasks and
22:04 - just press on it and it will be a stripe
22:07 - down as completed meeting George buying
22:10 - eggs are all completed so I'll give you
22:13 - the core to this to-do list application
22:16 - and you can download it and you can run
22:19 - it on your Apple
22:20 - local system with the vs cold so these
22:23 - are my top 10 vs code extension that I
22:26 - use very heavily in my website is any
22:28 - workflow

Cleaned transcript:

hello there and welcome to programming knowledge so in today's video I will be showing you the top ten most used my personal favorite we ask for extensions which I use for my daily personal web development uses so let's get started so in here I have three files this is a simple web application that is to do a todo list application in which you can add the tasks and at the end of the day when you are when you achieve those tasks you can just write them out so let's go to our extension tab and here I have searched for material theme just go inside the material theme and then you can see here this is the most epic time theme now so we can just set color theme and here you can see the most different uses choices we have this is material theme then we have high contrast then we darker darker high contrast then the pure light so P light is very much popular these days and then we have failed my high contrast then we have also ocean ocean high contrast and lighter or lighter is very harsh on our eyes so my person said it is pale light high contrast and then when you open the application you can see the theme how it looks then one more thing we have material icon theme so as you can see in our editor we have all the files like JavaScript style or chases and there are no particular icons for that so you can go in extension and we can choose material icon theme and just you stall it say installing when it does get installed it will ask for activating so click on activate and it is activated now let's go back to our editor and you can see okay we had we were asked let's go back to the Christiansen tab and we go for icon set far icon theme really we have to select what is icon theme in Mouse you go back to our editor you can see we have HTML file for two wrote HTML then style dot stays as we have says is three icon and also custom dot J's we have JavaScript icon so if we have different files like Android or angular or react you will get all the icons for that files also here in and also on top of the files next extension which I want to show you is prettier so what it does is it formats your code and it's like code formatter which gives you a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with your hones with its own rules that take maximum line length into account reppin code when necessary so there is a particular setting in this which we will use so that is format on sale so what will this do it will automatically format the code when we hate save you can go to settings so you can hit control comma or a command comma so here we've got our settings and in here search for format on save so we have to take this because by default is not it and that will be it so when we change the code for example let's mess up the our JavaScript file so in this if you give some spaces like this and then when you hit command yes that is save to automatic format it for you so this is what the prettier does you can go through more of this documentation like what you want so everything you will be getting in the documentation of the so let's look at one more plugin that is bracket bracket pair polarizer so so we have recordplayer colorizer and bracket paralyzer too so we will choose this one because it increases the speed and accuracy then the version 1 and this new version was with is because settings were cleaned up breaking backwards compatibility so we just install this now you can see it is installed so this extension is for colorizing the matching brackets so let's let's open our javascript file and here you can see we have curly braces and you can see the block of code he is bounded by a box of yellow color and the same way you can go for other functions too like this is for the inside function and if you go inside that you can see and it also matches the color of the bracket so we have pink and pink then yellow for ello and bounce it by a yellow color box so this is very useful when you are coding and the next extension I wanna show you is rainbow indent so that is indent rainbow and it gives rainbow colors for the indentation so it helps you for indenting so let's just you stall it and it's now installing and it is simply extension to make indentation more readable here you can see the example code here it first uses yellow then green then pink them to the top cream so let's go in this core you can see we have yellow and then we have a different color that is dream like that so it is helpful when you are writing a lot of code so if I indent it like this give me another color so this is the use case of the Indian train book now these was a visual extension so we will now look at the functional extension so first one is Auto rename tech so we install this so what this will do is when you change the starting tag shutting HTML to it well so change the ending HTML tag so you don't need to go down the block and change the other tech so it saves time when you are going through a lot of big code bases so for example I will give me here if we change let's see if it is install the IDS install so let's change this one like do we'll make it span and if you make it spam here also you can see the span is created if you if you make it as do ultimately this will also be made as view so this saves time and is very helpful for the web developers the next extension is rest client just search for it in the extension tab and here we get it so install it so it's very helpful for any frontend guy or backend developer so when you are working with API so when you want to see what response of the API is you can get that response using this extension in the vs code itself so usually you use a program called postman for doing registry API stuff and that is extra program but the benefit of using this plan tip extension is that everything is done in the vs code only so I will show you how to do it so it is now installed so let me go in my files so I will create a new file here called request dot HTTP so now I will type request so yes type get requests and we're gonna use the JSON placeholder so we'll type HTTP JSON place holder dot type co.com slashed posts and now I will just close the sidebar so for that we can use command B or control B on Windows and Mac so here you can see a button is popped up called send requests so just click on that and it will create a new window let's wait for that so a response we received so we are getting our header so we had 200 okay so you can see Jason's file so just this old or returns one hundred one hundred post and you can see the title the body of the post and user ID so this is an easy way to touch the stuff with the backend API is so you can have multiple pull requests in here so so you want to separate them you can use triple hash and then you can we can send a post request and we type the same code is HTTP JSON placeholder dot tiptip' code comm slash post and we set the content type application says on I will send data will include our title will say new post and then the body we'll say this is new post so if you send a request again so we'll get a 201 created and now you can see ID 1 0 1 new post is new post created and we had 200 IDs earlier and now it is 101 and this is an easy way to test and work with the backend API so this whole next extension is let's go an extension tab and search for CSS tweak so this extension allows you to pick the CSS definitions from your HTML files only so you don't need to go to CSS definitions in the CSS files so let's just install it ok so now this extension is installed so this is very helpful if you have a large CSS files and it is very hard to search through the suit through them then you can use just hit ctrl like let's go in our HTML file and if we have a class like this then you have to just hit ctrl and horror around it then you can see the peak definition and it will just open a window here and in here you can just change directly the CSS definition without opening the CSS files so if you're on Windows you can just you can just hit control and hover over it and if you're on the Mac you can just hit option and then f12 to get this window and you can change let's say float you change the color let's make it like 7 7 5 now the color is changed if you want to change the font size to 20 you can also change without opening the CSS file and you can just save it let's go taursus HTML file so how this works is let me just show you f12 so we got this one we change whatever you want to change 21 then you say old and then we just close this window and now our code is edited so this is very helpful and speeds up the process and then that which happens to have a multiple definition it will tell you to click to show and you will stay in the same HTML file and it will popup window where we can make altercation here and there and then after that we can just close the window so this is very helpful if you have large projects and we have a large lots of sizes the class is and you want to change it over the flow fly so this extension helps you to edit your HTML and CSS much quicker so the next extension is HTML CSS support so what this does it it helps you for providing the class completion to HTML files we have to install this so let me show you a demo so let's go in us our CSS file in the end we'll create a new class so we type dot demo then CSS and then we will make try something new so I am making it making the CSS class name little bigger so that we don't need to type it again and again and inside this will give color equal to red okay so now I just save it and go in the HTML file so in HTML file what you can do is it can just call the do using omit so we use the demo CSS try something name has come here just hit tab and then wait and then you can just type control space and we give you the mi deprivation just enter then you can see our du class with the new demo senses try something name has been created and you don't need to type all this manually so this is very helpful for auto completion of classes from CSS to HTML files so next extension is live SAS compiler so let's go in the extension tab in just in solid lab says compiler so what this does it it basically compiles SAS into CSS so for this you have to have some settings turned on so what you can do is you can eat ctrl + comma or command + comma if you are Mac so now you are on let's see now you're in settings so if you search for SAS you can see all the settings so click on labs has come love live SAS compiler here so in here going editing settings JSON and in here you might need to add some settings so I will just give you some settings here so this would be it just add these settings here this would be enough for you so it depends on which environment you are working on if you're in production environment you can just set this format equals to compressed and your extension name to dot mean dot CSS it's going to minify and compress automatically your CSS files so you can say path so my personal preference would be under the dis directory distribution directory I would be having the CSS so my all the JavaScript CSS and HTML files will be present in the dist folder and all my sass file will be in the root directory in the root that is outside the distribution folder so all those files are dot s CSS that is a sass files so the last settings we had it generate map so what it does 8 so by default it creates a map file which I never have I had needed to use so I said that to false and so that it's so unless file you have tricks then you have to Co settings and you can just close it I will just demonstrate sass and in my in the root directory what I was gonna do is a create a new folder as yes CSS folder and within that folder I said my file as mean dot s c SS and then we will just create some basic SS s here so we type body Jean as zero padding ed zero then I'm gonna I'm gonna just Nash so I'll call each one and just add color as blue so this is thought so this is not normal CSS this is says nesting so I'm gonna save it and nothing would happen because we have to create watch first so what we can do is we go in output ok click on watch SAS and now I can see our output is it is watching our draw test surface fires and you can see our institution folder is created which minified CSS and also the map file so if you open with the minified CSS it is it has created the minified version of CSS file so we look at the next extension so it is live server so we can go in the extension tab and we'll add by server so this again by 3 T so we have already installed it so what this basically does it it creates a local development server with live load features so you don't need to say every time any changes you make to the CSS files or your HTML files hitting the refresh button again nothing so it will automatically refresh the web pages whenever you save something so this is very helpful when you're creating a website and let's go on over HTML file so I will remove what I did it earlier and in here you can see we have a button in the town s go live if you click on that to create a chrome window and here you can see our HTML file is loaded here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you okay so I will just close this sidebar and I'm going to add let's say one more paragraph tag here so just add up T inside that just passed Thorin and then when we hit save automatic we can see it is lav loaded and all the paragraph text we are added it is present here shown in the web application so we don't need to hit refresh button again again so this is very helpful tool to speed up your website development workflow so if you are wondering what this application is it is very simple to do list application created using javascript so if you want to type like buy groceries you can just add it and to come down here and whenever we have completed two tasks and just press on it and it will be a stripe down as completed meeting George buying eggs are all completed so I'll give you the core to this todo list application and you can download it and you can run it on your Apple local system with the vs cold so these are my top 10 vs code extension that I use very heavily in my website is any workflow
