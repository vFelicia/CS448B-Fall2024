00:01 - hello everyone
00:02 - welcome to this course
00:04 - altrex for beginners in this course we
00:06 - would be discussing all about a tool
00:09 - called altrix we would be learning its
00:12 - practical concepts and we would be also
00:14 - seeing that why is it so useful
00:17 - also i would be showing you the
00:18 - procedure through which you can use it
00:20 - into your day to day lives
00:22 - also we would be seeing that what
00:24 - difference it is going to make and how
00:26 - it is going to prove useful to us
00:29 - so in this video we are going to
00:31 - introduce ourselves to this particular
00:33 - tool and discuss about its features so
00:36 - that you can decide whether to go for
00:37 - this course or not
00:39 - so this is the first video introduction
00:41 - to alteryx
00:43 - let us start by understanding that what
00:46 - actually is ultrix so alteryx is a tool
00:49 - that is primarily used for data cleaning
00:52 - so whenever you have a data set with you
00:55 - and you want to clean it then ninety
00:57 - percent of the task of data cleaning can
00:59 - be done automatically through ultrix
01:02 - apart from this the different features
01:05 - provided by alteryx are all combined
01:07 - into this slide
01:08 - altryx is not just only a data cleaning
01:11 - tool but it is also a predictive
01:13 - analysis tool
01:14 - predictive analysis means that a variety
01:17 - of statistical techniques
01:19 - are combined from like data mining
01:21 - predictive modeling and machine learning
01:24 - which will analyze the historical trends
01:26 - and will make predictions about the
01:28 - future
01:29 - so for this purpose we can use alteryx
01:32 - if you want spatial analysis that is
01:35 - when you want to analyze the locations
01:37 - uh relationships or basically the
01:40 - proximities in a geospatial data to
01:43 - extract the insights
01:45 - then you can use the stool ultrix altex
01:48 - also acts as an etl tool that means to
01:50 - extract transform and load
01:53 - the general procedure of copying the
01:55 - data from one source to destination
01:58 - which can then be used to visualize the
02:01 - data or represent it in a completely
02:03 - different format
02:04 - altryx also acts as a data blending tool
02:07 - that means you can get a data from the
02:09 - different sources and then merge it into
02:12 - a single data warehouse or basically a
02:14 - data set
02:16 - and then analyze it
02:18 - last but not the least ultra excesses
02:20 - says service analysis tool now what is
02:23 - this means cell service analysis tool so
02:26 - once you have created something called a
02:28 - workflow in ultrix now you do not need
02:31 - to create it again and again what you
02:33 - can do is simply combine the alteryx to
02:36 - just
02:37 - follow the same procedures that you have
02:39 - done up till now and ultrix would
02:41 - automatically do the same tasks for you
02:43 - means you can just create the workflow
02:45 - once and use it as many times as you
02:47 - want there is no limit on um using it
02:51 - you can create once used many times
02:54 - now let us understand that why should we
02:56 - use alteryx so these are some of the
02:59 - features that helps us to understand
03:01 - that why alteryx is so much important
03:03 - for us first of all no coding knowledge
03:06 - is needed for this tool it has a very
03:08 - simple interface if you have a knowledge
03:11 - of excel and some of the features of
03:13 - excel like pivot tables or vlookup then
03:16 - you can simply use eltrix for all of
03:19 - your needs so that is why if you do not
03:21 - have a strong coding background then you
03:23 - can use alteryx as well
03:26 - it has a very simple drag and drop
03:28 - interface all of the filters or all of
03:30 - the features all of the tools that you
03:32 - want to use that you can simply just
03:35 - drag and drop suppose you want to sort
03:36 - the data so we have a sorting tool
03:38 - provided to us in altrix all you need to
03:40 - do is drag it and drop it on your
03:42 - dataset and the data side would be
03:43 - sorted if you want to filter it
03:45 - according to particular criteria
03:46 - similarly you can just drag the filter
03:48 - tool and drop it over there and that
03:50 - particular filter would be applied
03:53 - it is compatible with different data
03:55 - sources around uh 80 plus data sources
03:58 - are supported by alteryx that means you
04:01 - can use the data set which is in any
04:03 - format it could be in the form of an
04:05 - excel file a csv file or basically a
04:08 - semi-structured or unstructured json
04:11 - file as well you can simply use it in
04:14 - ultrix import it in altrics and actually
04:17 - analyze it using the tool
04:19 - because it supports a variety of data
04:21 - sources
04:22 - the integration with the power bi tools
04:26 - with the business intelligence tools
04:28 - like power bi tableau qlik sense is also
04:31 - provided to irig so once you have
04:33 - created some of the insights in those
04:34 - tools you can easily interact
04:37 - with
04:38 - that report or with that dashboard using
04:41 - altrix you can actually make a
04:43 - connection between those two and get a
04:45 - better insight of your data
04:48 - now uh
04:50 - the last but not the least it is
04:52 - actually the most important feature of
04:54 - alteryx that is it provides automation
04:56 - of the manual tasks so all the tasks
04:58 - that you have been doing manually up
05:00 - till now you can actually automate them
05:02 - with the help of alteryx and once you
05:05 - have automated those tasks and once the
05:07 - workflow is created you do not have to
05:08 - create it again and again simply you can
05:10 - reuse it as many times as you want
05:14 - now let us take a look at some of the
05:16 - features of alteryx and these are the
05:17 - same features that make it so special
05:21 - so first of all is that it supports 80
05:23 - plus data sources as we have already
05:25 - discussed the data files that you are
05:28 - using in altrix can be in any format
05:30 - like a csv file an excel file json file
05:32 - xml file html file any type of a file if
05:36 - it contains data it is supported by altx
05:39 - you can simply just use it you can
05:41 - import it in address and then
05:43 - uh analyze it
05:45 - one more thing this number of the data
05:48 - sources is actually increasing as new
05:50 - versions of altrix are being released so
05:53 - uh even if your uh
05:56 - data source is not compatible right now
05:58 - it might come in the future
06:00 - it supports all the formats of data like
06:02 - it may be a structured data in the form
06:04 - of a sequel it could be semi-structured
06:06 - or unstructured data in the form of a
06:07 - json files so whatever the format of the
06:10 - data is it is supported by altrix you
06:13 - don't have to worry about the data
06:15 - format if it is not in a tabular format
06:17 - or so
06:18 - there are 260 plus automation tools that
06:21 - are available for analytics in altrix
06:24 - now these automation tools not only
06:26 - reduce our tasks but also make the
06:29 - analysis and the data cleaning process
06:31 - very smooth like you want to filter out
06:33 - some records you want to sort out some
06:34 - records all you have to do is just use
06:36 - these automation tools through a simple
06:39 - drag and drop and use them on your data
06:41 - set and just see that how it works you
06:44 - do not need to
06:45 - perform complex procedures you do not
06:47 - need any kind of according knowledge for
06:49 - this purpose just drag and drop
06:52 - report creation is supported from
06:54 - different data sources that means uh the
06:57 - different bi tools or the different data
06:59 - sources you can create reports using
07:01 - those like once you have created a
07:03 - report or a workflow in altrix then uh
07:06 - you can actually use the different data
07:08 - sources for different sorts of
07:09 - visualizations to be combined together
07:11 - in a single report so this is one of the
07:14 - best features supported by ultrix
07:17 - now once you have created the report and
07:18 - you want to share it with uh your team
07:20 - or with a different set of people then
07:22 - you can export this report in the
07:25 - different file formats that are
07:26 - supported by altrics
07:28 - like pdf excel file or many more
07:31 - uh and also with the upcoming versions
07:34 - this number of uh file formats are
07:36 - supported by address is also increasing
07:39 - finally altric supports the reusable
07:42 - workflows what does it means it means
07:44 - that once you have created a workflow
07:46 - you can reuse it as many times as you
07:48 - want you do not need to just perform
07:50 - those same steps again and again and
07:52 - again you can just simply reuse the
07:54 - workflow that you have already created
07:56 - so this is about the features of alteryx
07:59 - and
08:00 - now uh since we know about the basics of
08:03 - altrix and why is it so useful let us
08:06 - see that how can we actually install
08:09 - alteryx into our systems so it is a paid
08:12 - tool but you can get a trial version of
08:15 - 14 days for yourself
08:17 - so we would be just using that trial
08:19 - version only right now okay so for this
08:22 - what you need to do is just basically
08:24 - google ultrix
08:27 - here you will see this website official
08:29 - website www.altrex.com
08:32 - in this official website you need to go
08:34 - to this products option
08:36 - so once this products option is open you
08:38 - will see that these are these different
08:40 - products
08:42 - that are available like designer server
08:44 - intelligence suite etc from this we need
08:46 - to go with this designer product because
08:48 - it is suitable for individuals so let's
08:51 - just click on this learn more option
08:53 - once you click on this learn more option
08:55 - you will go to this home page of this
08:57 - particular product which is ultrex
08:59 - designer
09:00 - product
09:01 - you can just
09:03 - read all about it the system
09:05 - requirements and the features of this
09:06 - particular product
09:08 - then if you want to install it you can
09:10 - just click on start free trial if you
09:12 - want to watch a demo you can just go
09:14 - with the remove video let's just click
09:16 - on start free trial
09:18 - now what will it do is
09:20 - it will ask you if you are a new user or
09:23 - if you are an existing user or whatever
09:26 - so i'm a new user let's just click on a
09:28 - new user download now button now what
09:31 - will you do is it will ask you all of
09:33 - these details so you what you need to do
09:36 - is just actually provide all these
09:38 - details and once you have provided these
09:40 - details you can click on confirm once
09:42 - you will click on confirm the
09:44 - downloading process for an exe file will
09:47 - start for you
09:48 - so uh that's it that's the simple
09:51 - process for downloading this particular
09:53 - setup in the previous video we have
09:56 - already seen the features of alteryx and
09:59 - how to actually install its setup
10:02 - so
10:03 - now as you can see the exe file is
10:05 - already downloaded
10:07 - i'm just going to click on it to open it
10:09 - up and just work you out throughout this
10:12 - installation process
10:14 - right it is a very simple installation
10:16 - process so first of all what you need to
10:18 - do is you need to just go with the first
10:20 - option which is a typical ultrex version
10:24 - if you want uh our programming language
10:27 - based predictive tools which is an
10:29 - advanced version of alteryx you can go
10:31 - for it but since this course is aimed at
10:34 - beginners so we are just going with the
10:36 - typical version the language you can
10:38 - select i'm just going with english let's
10:40 - click on next
10:41 - then it is going to download all the
10:43 - required files so let's just wait for a
10:45 - few seconds till these files are
10:47 - downloaded
10:49 - now once all the required files are
10:52 - downloaded this kind of a menu
10:56 - will appear in front of you where it
10:58 - would
10:59 - be just verifying all the contents of
11:01 - the setup package so you need to wait
11:03 - for a few seconds
11:05 - let's just meet after this has been done
11:11 - now it will ask for uh
11:13 - where to install
11:15 - the application so you can just select a
11:18 - particular folder but i'm just going
11:20 - with the default path
11:21 - let's click on next
11:24 - accept the license agreement again click
11:26 - on next
11:27 - and then it's again going to take a few
11:29 - seconds to install the whole program
11:31 - onto your system
11:34 - now once all the installation process
11:37 - has been completed you would be getting
11:39 - just a screen just like this make sure
11:42 - this box is checked on and click on
11:44 - finish now once this box is checked on
11:47 - ultrix would automatically be running
11:49 - onto your system
11:51 - now once the altrix application has been
11:54 - launched onto your system it would ask
11:56 - you to enter a license key
11:58 - if you have a license key you can just
12:00 - enter it or you can simply click on
12:02 - start free trial then it would ask your
12:05 - mail address and just remember this
12:07 - thing that this should be the same email
12:09 - address
12:10 - that you needed to provide once
12:12 - you were registering like when you were
12:14 - providing your details the email address
12:16 - you entered over there that's the same
12:19 - address that you need to provide over
12:20 - here so let's just enter this email
12:22 - address and click on continue
12:25 - now once you have entered your email
12:26 - address it would ask you whether you
12:28 - want to include the ultrix intelligence
12:31 - suite in your package or not
12:33 - so
12:35 - for now what we can do is just click on
12:37 - this i'll try it later option because i
12:39 - just don't want to use it right now
12:42 - and you can click on start solving so
12:44 - once you have done all these steps this
12:46 - kind of a dialog box would appear for
12:48 - the tour we can just click on closed
12:50 - tour because we don't need it
12:52 - right so
12:54 - this is how the ultrex user interface is
12:56 - looking
12:57 - let us take a quick look at all the
13:00 - operations that are going to be of use
13:02 - to us so first of all we have this menu
13:05 - bar with the usual options like file
13:07 - edit view and many more if you just
13:09 - hover over it you will find these
13:11 - different options right next we have is
13:14 - this tabs these are the different tabs
13:16 - having different functionalities like
13:19 - if you want some
13:20 - to add some of the tools then you can
13:23 - use these tabs like for data preparation
13:25 - for joining
13:26 - for parsing for transforming for the
13:29 - machine learning etc these different
13:31 - tools are available if you want to use
13:32 - any tools what you need to do is just go
13:34 - to its tab
13:35 - get that tool suppose i want to apply a
13:37 - filter just drag it and drop it over
13:40 - here this place where drop tools here is
13:43 - written it is known as a workflow or
13:44 - canvas so you can just drop that
13:46 - particular tool over here and then you
13:49 - would be able to use it now once you've
13:52 - dropped a tool you can see that
13:53 - something changed over here this is a
13:55 - configuration window which would help us
13:58 - to configure this tools like
14:01 - if you want to apply a filter what kind
14:02 - of a filter you want to apply the basic
14:04 - filter or a custom filter in a basic
14:06 - filter what changes you want to do so
14:08 - all these customizations or
14:09 - configurations can be done through this
14:11 - tab known as the configuration tab now
14:13 - once you have configured all the tools
14:16 - into the canvas you can click on this
14:18 - button that is known as the run button
14:20 - to actually run this workflow the
14:22 - shortcut is ctrl r so either you can use
14:24 - the shortcut or just the run button then
14:26 - what will happen is you would be getting
14:28 - a result or an output so this result
14:31 - would be shown over here in this window
14:33 - this is known as the results window this
14:35 - is where the output would be shown to
14:37 - you
14:38 - right next we have is the search part
14:40 - that is really important especially for
14:43 - the beginners like there are different
14:45 - tabs and the different tools are
14:47 - actually
14:48 - separated in those steps suppose you
14:50 - want to search for a particular tool
14:53 - like let's say you want to search for a
14:54 - formula
14:55 - so we can just simply type formula and
14:58 - you would see this formula is over here
15:00 - you can just use it like this you can
15:02 - just drag it and drop it over here like
15:04 - this okay so this search bar would be of
15:07 - very use
15:08 - to us
15:10 - next we have is this kind of a plus sign
15:12 - so if you want to add or remove some of
15:13 - the tools because there are many tools
15:15 - supported by ultrix not all are shown
15:17 - over here you want to add or remove them
15:19 - you can just simply use this option
15:21 - suppose i don't want this sdk example so
15:24 - let's just uncheck this and in case of
15:27 - that i want a special analysis right so
15:30 - let's just check on spatial and click on
15:32 - ok so what would happen is as you can
15:35 - see
15:37 - the spatial has been added over here and
15:39 - the sdk analysis has been gone from here
15:42 - so this is how you can work with the
15:44 - simple interface of ultrix this is just
15:46 - the introduction part
15:48 - in this video we are going to see that
15:50 - how can we actually import a file into
15:53 - alteryx now altrex supports different
15:56 - formats of the file so no matter if your
15:58 - data is in the form of an excel file or
16:01 - a csv file or basically any of the
16:04 - formats that are supported by ultrix the
16:07 - importing process is going to be same
16:10 - in this video i'm going to import an
16:12 - excel file and show you that how it's
16:15 - done
16:16 - similarly you can just duplicate the
16:18 - steps for any of the file extensions
16:21 - that you have
16:22 - so let us start with the video this is
16:24 - the altrix interface and i have already
16:27 - created a new workflow now once
16:31 - you want to do anything in ultrix you
16:33 - need to create a workflow because that
16:35 - is like the basic building block in
16:37 - altrix so let me first show you how to
16:39 - create a workflow to create a workflow
16:41 - you can do three steps or basically any
16:44 - of the three process you can follow to
16:47 - create a workflow first of all is in
16:49 - this particular window there is this
16:51 - plus sign if you just click on this a
16:53 - new workflow would be created like new
16:55 - workflow two if you want to close the
16:57 - workflow of course there is this cross
16:59 - sign through which you can close this
17:00 - workflow the second way is that you can
17:03 - just go to this file on the top left
17:05 - corner and here is this option of new
17:07 - workflow if you just click on it a new
17:09 - workflow would be created or you can use
17:11 - the keyboard shortcut of control n to
17:13 - create a new workflow now once your
17:16 - workflow is created as we know in ultrix
17:19 - there are a number of tools that are
17:21 - supported by it and all the tools are
17:23 - available in the menu bar
17:25 - so the thing that we need to do is
17:27 - actually input the data as you can see
17:30 - we have these menus of different
17:32 - colors that helps us to organize the
17:35 - different tools
17:37 - and separate them from one another so
17:39 - here we need to go to this in and out
17:42 - tab and here we have this input data if
17:45 - you see there is this star sign over
17:47 - this input data which means that it has
17:49 - been also added to the favorites tab if
17:51 - you just go to the favorites tab here is
17:53 - the input data that is present so if you
17:55 - want uh some of your tools that you are
17:58 - frequently using to be added to your
17:59 - favorites that you can also do so that
18:01 - they are available to you in just one
18:04 - menu without having to switch the menus
18:06 - but here we are just going to in and out
18:09 - just drag it and drop
18:11 - this tool over here
18:13 - right now it's location doesn't matter
18:15 - you can essentially place it anywhere in
18:18 - this window
18:19 - then what we are going to do is as you
18:21 - can see as soon as we uh drag this tool
18:24 - over here this left side panel changed a
18:27 - little bit and why it changed it changed
18:29 - to accommodate the changes that are
18:31 - going to happen right now this means we
18:33 - are going to input some data so how can
18:36 - we input this data we are going to
18:37 - control this using this panel okay so
18:40 - first option is connect a file or
18:42 - database so let's just click on this
18:44 - drop down
18:45 - this shows us this data connections um
18:48 - tab on this data connections dialog box
18:50 - from here we need to select files now
18:53 - why are we selecting these files we are
18:54 - selecting this files because we have an
18:57 - excel sheet that is already created and
19:00 - that is what we want to uh import in it
19:03 - so let's just click on select file then
19:05 - you got to select the location so in my
19:08 - case the sheet that i want to import is
19:10 - present in this desktop and it's named
19:12 - as quarter one data dot
19:15 - xlsx
19:16 - that is it is an excel worksheet you can
19:18 - click on open
19:20 - now once you click on open this kind of
19:23 - an excel uh dialog box would be
19:25 - appearing in front of you let us
19:27 - understand this but before understanding
19:29 - it let us let me show you that how the
19:31 - excel file is looking okay
19:34 - so this is the excel sheet that we have
19:37 - available with us actually the whole
19:39 - excel file in this whole excel file we
19:41 - have three sheets uh november 2021
19:43 - december 2021 and jan 2022 so basically
19:47 - it contains three columns all of these
19:49 - sheets contains three or four columns in
19:52 - jan 2022 we have three columns which is
19:54 - date product and the quantity in
19:56 - december 2021 we have four columns date
19:59 - product quantity and the total number of
20:00 - sales
20:01 - and in november we have date product
20:04 - quantity and the number of the items
20:05 - that were returned okay so this is the
20:07 - excel sheet now one thing you must
20:09 - remember if you are working with ultrex
20:11 - that whatever file you are going to
20:13 - import in ultrix first you have to close
20:15 - that file i want to import this
20:16 - particular excel file into alteryx so i
20:19 - need to just close it so that it could
20:21 - work in alteryx so let me just close
20:22 - this file
20:23 - uh let me just delete this tool over
20:25 - here
20:27 - and simple delete keyword work over here
20:29 - again let's just drag and drop this tool
20:31 - over here
20:32 - and then we can just connect a filo
20:34 - database once again by clicking on this
20:36 - drop down going to files
20:39 - select file and this time this quarter
20:42 - one data dot
20:44 - excel file
20:45 - now here we have as you can see we had
20:48 - three sheets available that is december
20:49 - 2021 jan 2022 and november 2021
20:53 - so if you want to just import only a
20:55 - single sheet you can just select the
20:57 - sheet from here
20:59 - if you don't want to import the whole
21:01 - sheet you just want a range of cells
21:03 - that you can select from here or if you
21:06 - want a named range now what is the named
21:07 - range in case of excel if the named
21:10 - range is available
21:11 - so what would happen is like there is a
21:14 - table you can name a table that would be
21:16 - a named range so if that named range is
21:18 - available into your sheet this option
21:20 - would be enabled and then you can just
21:22 - select the named range that you want to
21:25 - import instead of the whole sheet okay
21:28 - or if you want to import the list of
21:30 - sheet names that uh it would only get
21:32 - you all the sheet names in a list format
21:34 - so i don't want all of this i just want
21:36 - to import the sheet that is the december
21:38 - 2021 sheet this is what i want to import
21:42 - now you can click on ok and once you
21:44 - click on ok you can see the left panel
21:47 - has again changed and this time we are
21:49 - getting a lot more information
21:52 - first of all on this bottom panel you
21:53 - can see the records are being shown
21:56 - since our sheet was small the number of
21:58 - records were less around six to seven
22:00 - records were there so all the records
22:02 - are being shown over here
22:04 - but if your data set is huge then only
22:07 - the first 100 records will be shown in
22:09 - this preview tab as you can see the
22:13 - message is written here preview first
22:14 - hundred record so only the first hundred
22:16 - records would be shown now if you want
22:18 - to make any changes over here this is
22:20 - the configuration panel that would allow
22:22 - you to make the changes right like you
22:24 - can set the record limit suppose there
22:26 - are seven records but i don't want all
22:27 - seven i just want the five records to be
22:29 - shown i can simply type here five but as
22:31 - you can see there is no change so how
22:33 - can we uh incorporate this change either
22:36 - we can click on this refresh button so
22:38 - only the five records would be visible
22:40 - or what we can do is if you want to use
22:43 - this output panel so what is this output
22:46 - panel this is an output panel that
22:48 - actually would import or
22:50 - show you the changes that would occur
22:52 - once you have made any changes into the
22:54 - tool right so we can just use this run
22:56 - button or the shortcut ctrl r to
22:59 - incorporate this output panel
23:02 - and as you can see once you click on the
23:04 - run button this dialog box would appear
23:06 - that would tell you that how much time
23:08 - this whole query this whole process took
23:11 - into um
23:12 - consideration that is point zero four
23:14 - seconds so let's just click on okay
23:17 - and now you can see the five records
23:18 - have been displayed you would get plenty
23:21 - of information in this output panel as
23:23 - well like how many fields are there so
23:24 - there are four fields and all the fields
23:26 - of this are being shown
23:28 - okay
23:29 - uh if you click on this drop down you
23:30 - would be able to change these fields if
23:32 - you want like uh all these fields are
23:34 - available let me just
23:37 - like all these fields that's checked
23:38 - right now suppose i don't want to get uh
23:41 - the date i just want all these things
23:42 - okay
23:43 - these three things so only these three
23:45 - things are visible and here we are
23:46 - getting
23:47 - information that three out of four
23:48 - fields are being shown you can
23:51 - just hide all fields or click on this
23:54 - tick sign to show all the fields okay
23:57 - then we have the format that is being
24:00 - displayed which is the cell viewer
24:01 - format
24:02 - if you want to get the information about
24:04 - the particular cell that you can't get
24:06 - like what is the name of the column what
24:08 - is its type what is its size where is
24:10 - the source file etc
24:13 - so all of this we are getting in the
24:15 - cell viewer information how many recalls
24:17 - are displayed over here this is also
24:18 - being shown
24:20 - so this is the data that we are getting
24:22 - next option is a metadata option so if
24:24 - you click on this metadata you would be
24:25 - getting information about the data like
24:27 - the sell viewer option that we just
24:29 - selected this is all available over here
24:31 - the name of the column its type its size
24:33 - and its source if the description you
24:36 - have added any description that would
24:37 - also be shown in this metadata let's
24:39 - just go to data because that's what we
24:41 - are going to work upon
24:42 - so this is about the output panel and
24:44 - the uh records or the information that
24:47 - it displays
24:48 - now let's head back to this left panel
24:50 - that is the configuration panel
24:52 - in this you can see the file format is
24:54 - excel
24:55 - if you want to change any of the file
24:56 - formats you can
24:58 - just select from these these are all
24:59 - supported by ultrix
25:02 - now we have output file name as field
25:05 - now what is this thing
25:07 - suppose you are importing multiple files
25:10 - in one go okay and you want to know that
25:13 - which field belongs to which file so you
25:15 - can use this particular option like
25:17 - right now it said to know let's just
25:19 - select file name only now if you just
25:21 - click on run remember one thing once you
25:23 - have made any change you have to click
25:25 - on run you will see that it would give
25:27 - you the name of the file or the excel
25:29 - file from where you have taken this data
25:32 - right so this is actually how the excel
25:35 - file is imported in ultrix it is a
25:37 - pretty simple process and as you can see
25:40 - it's very easy and gives you so much
25:42 - information about the data so in this
25:44 - video we are going to see two things
25:47 - first of all we are going to see that
25:48 - how can we save an altrix file or an
25:50 - eltrix workflow to be more precise
25:53 - next we are going to see that how can we
25:55 - import multiple files into ultrix okay
25:59 - so first of all let's see how can we
26:00 - save a workflow this is the workflow
26:02 - from our previous video it says that we
26:04 - have created
26:06 - so how do we save it we can just go to
26:08 - file there is this option to save with a
26:10 - shortcut ctrl s that you can select
26:13 - uh you have to select the path where you
26:15 - want to save so whatever path you want
26:18 - that you can just select
26:21 - so this is this ultrix files folder
26:23 - where i want to save it okay you can
26:25 - give it any name like let me just give
26:27 - it
26:29 - excel one
26:34 - okay and the
26:35 - extension is going to be y yx empty that
26:38 - means it is a workflow file okay
26:41 - then you can click on save once you have
26:43 - saved it you can see the workflow has
26:44 - renamed itself to xl1 dot yxmd okay
26:49 - so that's a pretty simple process of
26:50 - saving now what we can do is create a
26:52 - new workflow from here
26:54 - and just close this workflow so the new
26:57 - workflow that we have created is now
26:59 - going to help us import multiple files
27:01 - so first of all let's take a look at the
27:03 - files that we want to import okay
27:06 - okay so we have this folder called csv
27:09 - in which we have two csv files data 2021
27:12 - and data 2022 okay
27:15 - uh oh sorry data 2020. so what is the
27:17 - csv file csv stands for comma separated
27:20 - values in which all the records are
27:22 - separated by commas and are placed one
27:25 - beside the other so if you just open it
27:27 - with the help of a notepad you can see
27:29 - this is how this file is looking
27:32 - the names of the column is series
27:33 - reference period data value suppressed
27:36 - status units magnitude etc there are
27:39 - columns and then these are all the
27:41 - values of the columns and as you can see
27:43 - they are all separated by commas
27:45 - these are the commas that are going to
27:47 - separate them one from the other okay so
27:49 - this is the csv files that we have the
27:52 - name of the folder is csv it is present
27:54 - in the desktop and the two files is data
27:56 - 2021 and data 2020 okay
27:58 - so the common thing between them is the
28:01 - word data and the first two characters
28:03 - of the year that is 20 okay
28:06 - or actually the first three characters
28:08 - okay
28:09 - so let's see how can we work with it on
28:11 - ultrix so let's just bring our workflow
28:14 - let's just input the data so this is the
28:16 - tool drop it over here
28:18 - now what we are going to do is just
28:21 - click on this drop down the process of
28:24 - importing the file is going to be same
28:26 - okay let's just click on files select a
28:28 - file and here this is the csv folder and
28:32 - now if you want you can just select any
28:34 - of the file that you want to import okay
28:36 - so this is this status 2021 let's click
28:39 - on open
28:40 - now what would happen is uh the first
28:42 - 100 records would be shown to you if you
28:44 - just click on run this workflow then in
28:47 - the case of the output
28:49 - um you will get the time it takes to
28:52 - execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you
28:54 - would see how many columns are there
28:56 - there are a total of 14 columns and
28:58 - 5 000 records are being displayed now
29:01 - why the 5000 records are being displayed
29:03 - there are a total of around 20 000
29:05 - records okay so in the case of a huge
29:08 - data set
29:09 - we get only few records to be displayed
29:11 - in this output panel
29:13 - why is it because in the output panel
29:16 - the maximum allowed limit is 1 mb so how
29:18 - many records you can get in 1 mb only
29:21 - those records would be displayed right
29:23 - like in this case we have thousand one
29:25 - hundred and two records out of the total
29:27 - number
29:28 - now uh these are sufficient to get you
29:30 - an idea
29:31 - of the fact that uh how the things are
29:34 - gonna work
29:36 - so it's okay
29:37 - but
29:38 - here in this case what we are getting is
29:41 - only
29:42 - the records of the table uh of the sheet
29:46 - that is data 2021 we are not getting
29:48 - 2020s data right so how can we get
29:51 - multiple files how can we like import
29:53 - multiple files into alteryx right so for
29:56 - this we are going to use something known
29:58 - as the wildcard characters
30:00 - now there are multiple white card
30:02 - characters that are available but here
30:04 - we are going to use the asterix file
30:06 - card character and how are we going to
30:07 - use it here you can see uh when we
30:10 - import a file you get the path of that
30:12 - particular file okay so what i'm gonna
30:14 - do is just remove this thing
30:16 - and as we saw that the common ground was
30:20 - data space 20 20 or 22
30:24 - so the last
30:26 - digit was different just the two
30:29 - files rest of the name was same right so
30:32 - what we are going to do is after data
30:34 - i'm just going to put an asterisk
30:37 - and click on enter or click on refresh
30:39 - now once i do that all the data files
30:42 - over here
30:45 - are being uh you know
30:50 - imported
30:52 - so let's just wait for a few seconds
31:00 - right
31:04 - you just click on this
31:05 - you would get the file over here the
31:08 - link that would be
31:09 - was shown to you
31:12 - so here what we have done is actually i
31:15 - have reduced the number of records in
31:17 - both the files and why i have done this
31:21 - uh this step is done to uh just show you
31:24 - that how these two files are
31:26 - actually taken together okay
31:30 - so
31:30 - let's see how it is happening right now
31:32 - what we are getting over here is two
31:34 - warnings it is fairly normal it's just
31:37 - because the number of records
31:40 - were uh or the number of feets are
31:42 - different for different records okay
31:44 - so if you just click on this output
31:46 - column uh we are going uh getting total
31:48 - 13 records that are being displayed okay
31:51 - now these 13 records are actually
31:54 - from a combination of both the files
31:57 - that is 2021 and 2022 or 2021 or 2020
32:01 - okay
32:02 - now how do we verify this in order to
32:04 - verify this we are going to use this
32:06 - fourth field that is output file name as
32:08 - field right now it's selected to know
32:11 - that means we do not know which records
32:13 - belongs to which file but if we just
32:15 - select it to file name only and click on
32:17 - run for the workflow
32:20 - then we would be getting this dialog box
32:21 - let's just click on ok
32:23 - and we just click on this
32:25 - output panel then you can see the number
32:28 - of fields has changed to 15 and here is
32:30 - this file name field where we are
32:32 - getting 20 21 data and 2022 data okay
32:35 - so uh here you can see the first six
32:38 - records
32:39 - are from 2021 data and the remaining
32:42 - seven records are from 2022 data a
32:44 - combination of total 13 records is being
32:47 - shown over here that means there are a
32:49 - total of 13 records that are being
32:51 - displayed to us okay
32:53 - now
32:55 - let's just see what all uh things we can
32:57 - do over here
32:58 - and
32:59 - that is like
33:02 - just keep it to file name only here we
33:04 - have some information like the
33:06 - delimiters information so what is the
33:08 - delimiter like in comma separated values
33:10 - the different values are separated by a
33:12 - comma so that means comma is a delimiter
33:14 - it separates the values right so comma
33:17 - is taken as a delimiter if you have uh
33:19 - like a json file or an html file then of
33:23 - course comma would not be the delimiter
33:25 - the delimiter would be different so
33:27 - whatever character you want as a
33:29 - delimiter that you can use over here
33:32 - next we have first row contains field
33:34 - names so in order to understand this let
33:37 - me just open the csv file in notepad
33:39 - once okay
33:40 - so here is the csv file that i have
33:42 - opened in notepad this is the first
33:45 - series of commas that we are getting and
33:48 - this is actually
33:50 - the column names so this is the first
33:52 - field that is series reference period
33:54 - data value suppressed etc this is all
33:57 - taken as the field name so this first
34:00 - option that we have let me just close
34:01 - this file this first option that we have
34:03 - first row contains field names if it is
34:05 - checked then the first
34:07 - row is selected as the field names if
34:09 - you just uncheck it and run it once
34:11 - again
34:12 - then what would happen is
34:15 - let's click on ok
34:17 - show the output
34:19 - you can see field two field three field
34:21 - four like this all the field names had
34:23 - been shown to us and the first
34:25 - comma separated values that we had would
34:27 - be taken as a record itself right so
34:29 - which is of course not correct so let me
34:32 - just rectify it by again running it by
34:35 - checking that particular option okay
34:39 - uh next we have all these information
34:42 - which is actually not that important but
34:44 - it is there
34:46 - to you know just um
34:49 - give you much more information about the
34:51 - data one thing is ignore delimiters and
34:53 - quotes so suppose we have some values uh
34:56 - into our data which actually includes
34:58 - the comma like apple comma banana
35:01 - which are not two separate values so to
35:03 - tell the computer this thing what we can
35:05 - do is actually include it in quotes and
35:08 - that would be ignored as a delimiter so
35:10 - if you want to ignore anything as a
35:12 - delimiter that you can do okay so this
35:15 - is
35:15 - all about the multiple files there is
35:18 - one more thing that we need to know and
35:19 - that is suppose we make some changes
35:21 - into the folder let me just go to the
35:23 - csv folder and let me just copy this
35:26 - file and paste it so suppose there is a
35:28 - change in the folder
35:31 - let me just rename it to
35:34 - 2020 underscore data
35:37 - okay
35:39 - now what happens if i have added
35:42 - another file or if i remove some files
35:44 - okay we can just click on run
35:47 - and
35:49 - now if we just click on this output you
35:51 - can see the total number of records
35:53 - displayed is 20. so this whole process
35:57 - is now automatic if any changes are
35:59 - being made into your data
36:02 - or into the folder in the files that
36:04 - would be reflected automatically in
36:06 - altrix
36:07 - that's the beauty of this in this video
36:10 - we are going to talk about the data
36:11 - types that are supported in ultrix
36:14 - so as we know that alteryx is a
36:16 - self-service data analytics tool
36:18 - it makes the process of etl easier
36:22 - and it is a super tool that combines the
36:24 - functionalities that are required for
36:26 - the steps of data preparation geospatial
36:29 - analysis and data science
36:31 - mainly to support all these
36:33 - functionalities alteryx
36:35 - uses these five data types
36:38 - these are the five data types that are
36:39 - supported in ultrix which are string
36:42 - data numeric data date and time data
36:44 - boolean data and spatial objects
36:47 - once the data is brought into ultrix the
36:49 - alteryx data type is applied to the
36:51 - entire column and each value within that
36:54 - column
36:55 - ultrex tends to use the best suitable
36:57 - data type for the data coming from the
36:59 - databases or the structured files such
37:01 - as excel within the alteryx table
37:05 - now let us look at all of these data
37:07 - types in detail one by one
37:09 - so first of all we come to the string
37:11 - data type
37:12 - string data represents only text
37:15 - even if the data is numeric or spaces or
37:17 - special characters if a string consists
37:19 - of numbers it is ideally advised uh to
37:22 - first convert it to the numeric data
37:24 - type then you can just perform the
37:25 - calculations into it
37:27 - the string data is the one that is kept
37:30 - as it is
37:32 - it is further divided into these four
37:33 - categories that is string v string w
37:37 - string and v underscore string
37:39 - string and w string are a fixed length
37:42 - and you have to set the predefined
37:43 - length of the string so suppose you have
37:45 - set 8 to 100 characters then every time
37:47 - it would take 100 characters
37:50 - the w string can hold more international
37:52 - characters
37:54 - now we have v string and we underscore w
37:56 - string it stands for variable the v here
37:59 - stands for variable that means we cannot
38:01 - set any predefined length or we should
38:03 - not send
38:04 - any predefined length and it adjusts
38:07 - itself according to the length
38:09 - of the text of of the value that it is
38:12 - going to hold
38:14 - next we have is the numeric data type
38:16 - numeric alteryx data types um
38:19 - are the ones that contains only the
38:21 - numbers
38:22 - it stores the numbers
38:24 - that could be represented by either a
38:26 - single lizard or by multiple digits as
38:28 - well
38:29 - we have different combinations in this
38:31 - like byte integer
38:33 - fixed decimal float and double
38:36 - byte and integer are the whole numbers
38:38 - fixed decimal float and double include a
38:41 - decimal number as well
38:43 - byte is a small number then we have
38:45 - integer which has more significant
38:47 - numbers as you can see they range as
38:48 - well in the examples
38:51 - then we have fixed decimal which is used
38:54 - for currency and float and double so
38:57 - this is fixed sml which is used as a
38:59 - currency
39:00 - that's a numeric value with a decimal
39:02 - next we have the float and double which
39:05 - are used for most precise numbers
39:08 - float and code are not
39:09 - good because it comes to comparison they
39:12 - are never equal
39:14 - float is generally used to save the
39:16 - memory
39:18 - now the next data type we have is the
39:20 - date time data type
39:21 - uh in altrix the format of date
39:25 - time and date and time combined together
39:27 - are fixed
39:28 - so you will need to do some manipulation
39:30 - on your data if it is not in the format
39:33 - that you need
39:34 - as generalized by ultrix
39:36 - sometimes it is very difficult to work
39:39 - with date and time
39:40 - there is a tool known as the datetime
39:42 - macro that converts the date and time in
39:45 - human readable as well as ultrix
39:47 - readable format
39:49 - so the format is as you can see for the
39:51 - date there is a 10 character string
39:53 - employing four characters for year
39:56 - two for month and two for date this is
39:58 - the general format that is supported by
40:00 - ultrix
40:01 - then we have time which is again an
40:03 - eight character string
40:05 - two characters for r2 for minutes and
40:07 - two for seconds
40:08 - and the examples have been shown on the
40:10 - right side of the screen
40:12 - next we have date and time combined
40:14 - which is a 19 character string
40:16 - employing four characters for the year
40:18 - two for the month two for the date and
40:21 - two each for the hours minutes and
40:22 - seconds and an example has been shown on
40:25 - the right side
40:27 - so these are the date and time data
40:29 - types that are supported in ultrix
40:31 - next we have is the boolean data type
40:35 - so the boolean
40:36 - basically represents a flag and it has
40:39 - only two possible values that is true
40:41 - and false so true means non-zero or one
40:45 - and false means zero
40:48 - or basically any other digit that is not
40:51 - zero can be considered as true
40:53 - boolean is used to basically
40:56 - characterize the objects categorize them
40:58 - into various categories or identify them
41:00 - whether the objects
41:02 - are a part of the particular category or
41:04 - not for example let's take up
41:07 - a student data set
41:08 - so
41:09 - in the student data set we can check
41:11 - that if the student has passed the test
41:14 - or not so we can just create or the data
41:17 - can have
41:18 - a column as passed it could have values
41:21 - true false or yes no
41:23 - so true false in that case would be
41:25 - represented using the boolean data types
41:30 - next we have is the spatial objects
41:32 - spatial objects are used for mapping
41:35 - and are associated with maintaining the
41:37 - data records
41:38 - a point a line polyline or polygon all
41:43 - comes out of spatial objects which can
41:45 - be used for mapping
41:48 - it is associated with the data record
41:50 - and
41:51 - they can be multiple spatial object
41:53 - fields in a table
41:55 - furthermore if you want to use any of
41:57 - the data like which is
42:00 - which cannot be represented in the
42:01 - format of a text like uh let's suppose
42:03 - an image or a video
42:05 - or an audio file then we use the spatial
42:08 - objects again
42:10 - so what happens is when you just
42:12 - import the uh
42:14 - table or any kind of an excel file
42:17 - then what happens is these spatial
42:19 - objects are
42:20 - automatically invoked actually there are
42:23 - two ways through which
42:25 - this alteryx
42:27 - imports this data types like how it uses
42:30 - these data types so let us take a look
42:31 - at them as well
42:33 - data in alteryx can be brought through
42:35 - these two fields or three
42:38 - through these two tools that is the auto
42:40 - field tool and the select tool now what
42:42 - is the difference between them auto
42:44 - field tool is used to select the data
42:46 - type automatically by alterix while the
42:48 - select tool
42:50 - helps the user to decide the data type
42:52 - so in case you are a user and you don't
42:54 - want an overhead of
42:56 - selecting the data data for alteryx you
42:58 - can just go for the auto field tool
43:01 - so auto field tool is used to read
43:03 - through all of the records of an input
43:05 - and set the field type to the smallest
43:07 - possible size that is relative to the
43:10 - data contained in the column the tool
43:12 - correctly assigns a numeric field to a
43:15 - string data type where any record starts
43:17 - with 0 and not a number
43:20 - so in order to configure the tool we can
43:22 - just go to the select string fields to
43:24 - auto change field type and select the
43:27 - fields to auto configure them
43:29 - we can use either individually or all
43:31 - the fields at once as well
43:35 - next we have is the select tool so the
43:37 - select tool is used to include exclude
43:40 - and reorder the columns of data that
43:42 - pass through your workflow excluding the
43:44 - columns that can limit the data passing
43:46 - through a workflow and improve
43:48 - performance we can also use the select
43:50 - tool to modify the type and size of the
43:52 - data rename a column or add a
43:54 - description to it
43:56 - now there are other tools that include
43:58 - the select tool functionality such
44:00 - are append fields tool fine nearest tool
44:03 - join tool join multiple tool selecting
44:05 - db tool and spatial match tool we can
44:08 - use the table to modify the incoming
44:10 - data stream each row in the table
44:12 - represents a column in the data the
44:14 - field column in the table identifies the
44:16 - name of the column in the data and auto
44:18 - sizes to fit the column names without
44:20 - cutting of any text
44:22 - which is taken up to 40 characters
44:24 - so this is how the autofill tool and the
44:27 - select tool works
44:29 - in itrex now as we know that there are
44:31 - multiple tools in ultrix and each of
44:34 - them have a specific functionality in
44:37 - case you are interested in learning more
44:39 - about these tools then what you can do
44:41 - is refer to the official alteryx
44:44 - documentation now how to access it let
44:46 - me show you
44:47 - so in order to access it first of all i
44:49 - have opened up google and all you need
44:51 - to do is google alteryx help
44:54 - so once you uh google it the first link
44:57 - that comes up is the home page instead
44:59 - of going to the home page you can select
45:01 - on this documentation
45:03 - link so what would happen is the whole
45:06 - alteryx health documentation would be
45:09 - open in front of you now in case you
45:10 - want to learn about anything related to
45:12 - alteryx you can refer to this
45:14 - documentation which is
45:15 - very much precise and clean in case you
45:18 - want to learn about these tools specific
45:20 - tools then you can refer to this um
45:23 - menu over here where all the tools are
45:26 - present and they are configured or they
45:28 - are
45:29 - grouped together like all these tools
45:32 - that are present in the in out tab are
45:33 - together grouped in this in out the
45:36 - tools that are present in the
45:37 - preparation tab are all present over
45:39 - here you can click on any of these links
45:41 - and that link would be opened here you
45:43 - would find the
45:45 - way through which you can use the tools
45:47 - how to use it how is it looking and how
45:50 - you can configure it
45:53 - then uh
45:54 - you can also see some examples that what
45:56 - would happen when this tool is being
45:58 - used what kind of output you would be
46:00 - think
46:01 - so uh these are
46:03 - the documentation that would help you to
46:04 - learn about all the tools in alteryx but
46:07 - the common ones that are used and the
46:09 - most important ones we would be covering
46:11 - in this course in this video we are
46:12 - going to start
46:14 - discussing about the important tools in
46:18 - ultrix the tools that would help you
46:20 - carry out the different tasks that are
46:22 - really important throughout your atrix
46:25 - journey
46:26 - so uh without any further ado let us
46:28 - start with this video
46:30 - first of all before jumping into the
46:32 - tools part let us download the data set
46:36 - now this data set that we are going to
46:37 - download is going to be used throughout
46:40 - this course
46:41 - so
46:42 - it is important for you to have a copy
46:45 - of this data set for you as well
46:47 - so how do we download this uh first of
46:49 - all what you need to do is simply google
46:51 - sample superstore data set like i have
46:53 - googled over here
46:55 - now once you do that the first link that
46:56 - would come up would be a tableau
46:58 - community so let's just click on this
47:00 - link
47:02 - and
47:04 - this is actually a data set that has the
47:08 - different types of information like the
47:11 - five data types of alteryx that we have
47:13 - just learned are all supported in this
47:15 - particular data set it has around 10 000
47:18 - records so it is easier for you to
47:20 - understand the concepts and practice it
47:23 - on this kind of a data set it is
47:25 - available for free so you can use it as
47:28 - many times as you want now once this
47:30 - link is open here you can see this is an
47:32 - excel file you can just simply click on
47:34 - download and store it into the location
47:37 - that you want
47:38 - so since i have already downloaded it
47:40 - over here sample superstore.xlx
47:42 - as you can see so i'm not going to
47:44 - redownload it but you can just save it
47:47 - now once you have downloaded the data
47:48 - set let's come back to our ultrix tool
47:51 - here today i am going to discuss about
47:54 - the browse tool in ultrix now the browse
47:57 - tool is a really important tool and here
47:59 - i have actually implemented the browse
48:01 - tool but what i am going to do is just
48:03 - delete all of this functionality and
48:05 - show you once again that how it is
48:07 - working okay
48:09 - so first of all let's understand what is
48:11 - a browse tool as you can see uh we have
48:13 - in this favorites tab the browse tool is
48:15 - available but if you
48:17 - check the in out tab that's where the
48:20 - browse tool would be present okay
48:22 - so the browse tool is used to view the
48:24 - data from a connected tool what do you
48:26 - mean by a connected tool that means the
48:28 - browse tool if you just bring it over
48:30 - here like this then it won't be able to
48:32 - show you some data it needs some kind of
48:34 - a tool
48:35 - so browse tool is actually a connected
48:37 - tool
48:38 - okay so we can see the data profile
48:43 - for multiple columns at once in a single
48:45 - holistic view or for a single column of
48:47 - the data
48:49 - we can
48:50 - see the information on data type the
48:52 - number of records the quality of the
48:54 - data and a variety of other statistics
48:57 - as well using the browse tool
48:59 - in case of a spatial report or a
49:01 - behavioral data analysis
49:03 - the type is connected an additional tab
49:05 - is available in the browse tool
49:08 - that shows the preview of the actual
49:10 - object on a map or a report okay
49:14 - so browse rule if you just bring it up
49:17 - let's
49:18 - understand this
49:19 - this
49:20 - thing that's green over here is known as
49:22 - an anchor it has one anchor
49:25 - that is the input anchor now if you just
49:27 - bring up this input data tool which we
49:29 - have already used you can see it also
49:31 - has one anchor but it has in the shape
49:34 - of the anchor of the browse tool and the
49:35 - input tool is different so the input
49:38 - tool has an output anchor that means the
49:40 - input tool contains the data and it
49:43 - gives its data to some other tool browse
49:45 - tool on the other hand
49:47 - cannot exist independently it needs some
49:50 - other tool to exist that's why it takes
49:52 - the data from some other tool and to
49:55 - take the data from some other tool it
49:56 - needs an anchor that's why to use the
49:59 - browse tool at least the input tool
50:01 - should be present so that it acts as an
50:03 - input anchor and this acts as a
50:05 - receiving anchor for itself okay
50:07 - so
50:09 - let us now see how can we uh use the
50:11 - data or use the browse tool to show the
50:14 - data the data profile okay so first of
50:17 - all uh we have this input tool using
50:19 - this input tool what i'm gonna do is
50:21 - actually import a file into ultrix okay
50:24 - the sample superstore data set file that
50:26 - we have just
50:27 - downloaded that is the file that i'm
50:29 - going to import so let's go to file
50:33 - and select file
50:34 - here is the sample superstore file
50:37 - let us open it
50:39 - now it asks for a sheet so the order
50:41 - sheet is what i'm going to go with let's
50:43 - just click on ok
50:45 - so after a few seconds you can see that
50:48 - here in the configuration panel we have
50:50 - this whole data set right now only a
50:53 - hundred rows are being shown over here
50:54 - if we just run this workflow
50:57 - then we would be able to see it in the
51:00 - output column
51:02 - but the output would not be shown over
51:04 - here right now
51:10 - and these kind of errors would be
51:12 - opening why because of the browse tool
51:15 - we have used the browse tool but not
51:17 - actually provided a connection to it so
51:19 - let's see how do we work with it
51:23 - how do we uh you know
51:26 - work around it okay so let's just first
51:28 - close this message
51:30 - now what we are going to do is connect
51:31 - these two anchors like
51:33 - this drag from the input anchor and drop
51:36 - it to the browse tool anchor
51:38 - right now it's going to take a few
51:39 - seconds
51:40 - and again if we just run the workflow
51:45 - then it's going to take a few seconds
51:47 - and then the information will be shown
51:49 - you can see the percentage of the work
51:50 - that's been done
51:53 - and once all the work has been done you
51:55 - would get this kind of a message let's
51:57 - click on ok
51:58 - now the information being shown in the
52:00 - configuration panel is with relevant to
52:02 - the input data tool if we just click on
52:03 - the browse tool then right now nothing
52:05 - is being shown because we have not
52:07 - selected any of the records right if you
52:09 - remember i just told you that uh you
52:11 - have to select at least one column or
52:14 - you can select multiple columns as well
52:16 - uh so that the information is being
52:18 - shown
52:19 - to you okay so let us just select some
52:21 - column or let's say the category column
52:23 - if we just select this category column
52:25 - from here
52:27 - then wait for a few seconds and the
52:29 - information or the report of the
52:30 - category column or the data profile of
52:33 - the category column would be shown in
52:34 - this configuration panel okay
52:38 - so this is the data profile of the
52:40 - category column that has been shown over
52:42 - here
52:45 - just a second
52:48 - yeah
52:49 - so um
52:52 - we just select the category column here
52:54 - it is being shown
52:56 - and as you can see the data type first
52:58 - it has taken is the variable string so
53:00 - that means the
53:02 - uh length is variable to just save the
53:05 - memory space the total number of records
53:07 - the size that has been taken is 255
53:10 - bytes okay
53:11 - now out of the total 909 994 records the
53:15 - total records that are okay is all the
53:19 - records are okay here you can see the
53:20 - number of records that are okay and the
53:22 - percentage so 100 records are okay
53:25 - unique means how many different values
53:27 - are there so as you can see we are
53:28 - getting three over here that means the
53:31 - three possible values for category are
53:32 - furniture office supplies and technology
53:36 - that has been shown over here
53:37 - then we have some of the statistics of
53:39 - the length so the minimum length of the
53:41 - value is nine as you can see it should
53:43 - be furniture
53:45 - then the maximum is 15 which is for
53:47 - office space supplies
53:49 - then uh we have the shortest value which
53:51 - is furniture of course longest value is
53:53 - office underscore supplies
53:55 - then uh we have the first alphanumeric
53:57 - value that is the first value that you
53:58 - are getting is furniture and the last
54:00 - record must be having the category as
54:03 - office supplies right
54:06 - as technology
54:07 - there are no blanks that means the
54:10 - particular column is clean it has no
54:12 - inconsistent data
54:14 - there is no leading white space and
54:15 - there is no trailing white space now
54:17 - there is another reason of choosing this
54:19 - particular data set because this is a
54:20 - clean data set it does not have any of
54:22 - the inconsistencies so for us as a
54:25 - beginner it's easier to understand and
54:27 - work with these kind of data sets okay
54:30 - then we have the frequent values
54:33 - so it would tell you that how many um
54:37 - instances of the particular category are
54:39 - there if we talk about office supplies
54:41 - so there are six thousand uh 26 records
54:44 - of the office supplies that is the most
54:46 - number of records for this then we have
54:47 - furniture about 2121 records and
54:51 - technology with 1.8 k records
54:55 - so this is the data profile of the
54:57 - particular column that has been shown
54:59 - over here as you can see the column is
55:01 - uh taken over here as category if we
55:03 - just try to employ sub category as well
55:05 - over here
55:09 - so this is the sub category
55:12 - that we have employed over here right
55:14 - now and now the summary has changed as
55:16 - you can see the number of unique values
55:17 - is 17 now so there are 17 subcategories
55:22 - and here is the uh introduction of the
55:24 - individual sub categories the frequent
55:25 - values the graph that is being shown
55:27 - over here there are 12 more values you
55:29 - can expand it and see that what is the
55:31 - occurrence of each of these
55:32 - subcategories okay
55:35 - next we have is the country so the
55:37 - country if you just select on this
55:38 - country column it's all united states
55:41 - right now so
55:43 - i don't think it's going to make any
55:44 - difference then we have the cities which
55:47 - has 531 unique values for the cities and
55:50 - how it has been shown so this is the
55:52 - usage of the browse tool through which
55:54 - it is used to show the different records
55:56 - okay
55:58 - now
55:59 - in order to view multiple values
56:02 - what we can do is actually use the left
56:05 - right view or the top bottom view
56:07 - right now subcategory is being selected
56:09 - in this profile but in this profile
56:11 - nothing is being selected as you scroll
56:13 - down you can see that the different
56:15 - columns are being shown over here so
56:17 - suppose i want to show the segment i can
56:19 - just click on segment and the values or
56:21 - the data profile or segment would be
56:22 - shown over here
56:24 - so here you can see the segment it has
56:27 - three unique values
56:29 - consumer home office are the two values
56:31 - and the third value as you can see is
56:33 - the corporate segment so the data
56:35 - profile of two
56:37 - columns are being shown over here using
56:39 - the browse tools simultaneously so
56:41 - that's all about the browse tool that
56:43 - you need to know in this video we are
56:45 - going to talk about data manipulation
56:48 - and output tool in ultrix
56:52 - so as we know that alteryx is a tool
56:54 - that is used for the purposes of data
56:56 - cleaning as well right so what we are
56:59 - going to do today is actually i am going
57:02 - to show you how to clean the data
57:05 - if inconsistencies are present using the
57:07 - data manipulation tool in ultrix okay
57:10 - so this is the sample superstore data
57:12 - set that we downloaded and as i have
57:15 - already told you that it is a super
57:17 - clean data set there are no
57:19 - inconsistencies in this data set so what
57:21 - i have done is i have introduced
57:23 - an inconsistency
57:25 - and that is in this furniture
57:28 - what i have done is
57:30 - i have actually added some
57:32 - leading white spaces in this category
57:34 - furniture i have added some leading
57:36 - white spaces now let us add some more in
57:39 - the subcategory field okay so there is
57:42 - this chairs i am just going to replace
57:44 - the stairs value
57:48 - and
57:49 - introduce some leading white spaces so
57:51 - around three white spaces would be good
57:54 - and replace all the values of okay so
57:57 - 791 replacements were made
58:00 - and this is the change that i have done
58:01 - to introduce some inconsistencies into
58:03 - our data set and to see that how can we
58:05 - solve it using ultrax now using control
58:08 - s let me just save this excel file and
58:10 - close this excel file
58:13 - right so let's create a new workflow new
58:15 - workflow 3 over here and uh just
58:19 - import this data set so let's just use
58:22 - this input data
58:24 - and what we're going to do is connect it
58:26 - to a file
58:28 - so this is the data set that we have and
58:31 - the orders sheet click on okay
58:34 - so now um
58:36 - as you can see there is nothing that's
58:38 - been shown over here let's just add a
58:40 - browse tool now there is another way
58:41 - through adding a browse tool that's you
58:43 - can just right click over here
58:45 - and there is this option add browse
58:47 - after and the shortcut for the same as
58:49 - ctrl shift b
58:50 - so you can just add it and click on run
58:53 - now once you do that
58:55 - what would happen is uh you would get
58:57 - this kind of a message and
59:00 - of course the records would be shown
59:02 - over here okay so the profiles have been
59:04 - shown over here now the changes we made
59:06 - were in the category okay so let's just
59:09 - see the category and the subcategory
59:11 - right now
59:12 - the changes were made in the category
59:13 - and the subcategory fields now if you
59:15 - just hover over this category field
59:17 - there are few records
59:19 - that are not okay
59:21 - right the red line has been shown over
59:23 - here and um that is around 21.22 records
59:27 - that are not okay in the category field
59:29 - because the inconsistency is there
59:31 - similarly in the sub category field as
59:33 - well there is 6.17 records uh 6.17
59:37 - records that are not okay represented by
59:39 - red so if you just show the category
59:42 - over here and just split the view
59:45 - so over here we had been shown the
59:47 - category field and here let's just go
59:49 - with the subcategory field
59:51 - so here is the subcategory field okay
59:55 - so now what we get first of all let's
59:56 - take a look at the category field that
59:59 - is uh 7 000
60:01 - some records are okay but 2121 reports
60:04 - are not okay
60:06 - now what is the reason uh that these
60:08 - records are not okay
60:09 - these are the values with leading white
60:11 - space how many values 2121 values okay
60:15 - similarly if we just talk about the sub
60:17 - category over here
60:19 - so we have
60:20 - 617 records that are not okay
60:22 - represented in the red color
60:25 - and what is the issue the issue is the
60:28 - values with the leading white space so
60:30 - these are some of the inconsistencies
60:31 - that would be shown into your data
60:33 - profile only okay so how do we uh just
60:36 - get rid of these inconsistencies right
60:39 - so what you need to do is search for
60:41 - that particular column over here here as
60:43 - well you can see that the mark of not
60:46 - okay is being shown over here
60:48 - represented by red and the rest is green
60:50 - in category and subcategory fields okay
60:52 - in the output pane and the values that
60:54 - are inconsistent have been marked as red
60:57 - and the message is the cell has leading
61:00 - spaces the cell has leading spaces so
61:02 - whatever the inconsistency is it's been
61:04 - automatically shown to you by ultrix now
61:06 - how do we manipulate it how do we clean
61:09 - it
61:09 - you need to select the column which has
61:11 - inconsistency click on these three dots
61:13 - here we have the option of data cleanse
61:16 - so you can just go to
61:19 - this data cleanse option just a
61:22 - second and here we have remove unwanted
61:25 - characters and in the remove unwanted
61:28 - characters the first option is leading
61:30 - slash trailing white space so that means
61:32 - any of the uh leading or the trailing
61:34 - white spaces if there would be removed
61:36 - so just select that option and click on
61:38 - apply
61:39 - now it's going to take a few seconds and
61:42 - the changes would be applied now once
61:44 - the changes have been applied you can
61:46 - see the red mark in the category has
61:47 - gone from here
61:49 - we can see them all correctly the
61:51 - furniture leading spaces have been
61:53 - removed if you want to cross check it
61:55 - let's just bring up the category field
61:56 - once again
62:00 - here
62:02 - so if you see
62:03 - right now okay is change to a hundred
62:05 - percent
62:06 - similarly we can do the same thing for
62:08 - the sub category field as well we can go
62:10 - to subcategory data cleanse remove
62:12 - unwanted characters leading trailing
62:14 - white space and click on apply
62:16 - now again it's going to take a few
62:18 - seconds and the changes would be applied
62:23 - in order to crosstrick it you can just
62:25 - go to the subcategory option over here
62:28 - and the okay has been changed to 100
62:31 - now again run the workflow
62:36 - so if you again run the workflow the
62:38 - inconsistencies would be uh introduced
62:40 - once again and why is that because
62:43 - now what we are getting is we are again
62:45 - getting the data from input
62:47 - that means alterix only makes changes
62:49 - into the format of the data that is
62:51 - brought in front of it not only original
62:53 - files okay
62:54 - so that's why uh using the browse tool
62:56 - the changes that have been made are only
62:58 - made onto this data that has been used
63:01 - in ultrix right
63:03 - now once we have changed the data what
63:05 - we need to do is actually make use of
63:07 - this data right
63:09 - so what i'm going to do is output this
63:12 - data into an excel file
63:14 - but not on to a single sheet into
63:16 - multiple sheets
63:18 - so how do we do that for this we use the
63:21 - output data tool of this in out category
63:24 - so output data tool let's just bring it
63:26 - up
63:27 - now what i'm going to do with this
63:29 - output data tool is
63:31 - i'm going to select the category as the
63:33 - criteria
63:34 - so what i'm going to do or what i'm
63:37 - planning to do is actually use
63:40 - this category over here
63:42 - to output the data
63:44 - right or basically use a segment to
63:47 - output the data
63:51 - uh so what would happen is
63:54 - all the data
63:55 - uh
63:56 - all three uh separate sheets would be
63:59 - created right so
64:02 - uh if we just apply this segment if you
64:05 - just take a look at the segment field
64:09 - just a second
64:14 - okay so now if we take a look at this
64:16 - segment then what we are getting is that
64:18 - there are three unique values so that
64:20 - means three different sheets would be
64:21 - created in the excel file so for this
64:23 - what we need to do is go to this output
64:25 - tool
64:26 - uh click on this arrow here and go to
64:29 - files and select file so basically we
64:32 - are selecting the location where our
64:33 - file needs to be saved now provide a
64:36 - name for the file let's say
64:37 - output
64:40 - excel
64:42 - okay
64:42 - and make sure that in the save as type
64:46 - it is selected as uh an excel file or a
64:49 - microsoft excel for the extension
64:52 - xls or xlsx
64:54 - because then only you would be able to
64:56 - create multiple sheets in case you
64:58 - decide to save it as an alterex database
65:01 - so multiple sheets in that case is not
65:03 - possible okay
65:04 - click on save
65:06 - now uh it would ask you to specify the
65:08 - name of a sheet we can just go with
65:10 - sheet1 and click on ok great
65:15 - now what would happen is
65:18 - if we just click on this tool
65:20 - here we have this configuration panel in
65:22 - this you need to just check this option
65:24 - that is take file slash
65:26 - table name from field
65:28 - then there is this drop down from this
65:30 - drop down you have to select the third
65:32 - option which is change file slash table
65:34 - name
65:35 - now what would happen is this would
65:36 - allow you to select the column on the
65:39 - basis of which you want to create
65:40 - different sheets right
65:42 - so
65:43 - uh here we can just use the drop down to
65:45 - select the
65:48 - value and that is the segment so you can
65:49 - just select the segment
65:52 - once you have done all the steps then
65:54 - you need to use this control r or run
65:57 - button to just run the workflow
66:00 - then you can see that the
66:03 - dialog box would be there showing the
66:05 - time taken and if you just click on this
66:07 - messages or that is this three
66:10 - hamburger menu over here you will see
66:12 - that these three sheets were created
66:14 - consumer corporate and the home office
66:16 - sheets and the number of records that
66:18 - were written into each of these sheets
66:21 - to cross check what you can do is go to
66:23 - that particular folder which was present
66:25 - in my desktop here output excel
66:28 - the excel sheet that has been created
66:31 - and you can see that there are three
66:33 - sheets that are available
66:35 - the consumer sheet the corporate sheet
66:37 - and the home office sheet now each of
66:39 - these sheets has their data that is
66:41 - split according to their segments all
66:43 - the home office data in this sheet all
66:45 - the corporate data in this sheet and all
66:46 - the consumer data in this sheet so this
66:48 - is how the output tool in ultrix works
66:52 - the output data tool is used to output
66:54 - the multiple excel sheets in this video
66:56 - we are going to take a look at the few
66:59 - tools of this in out configuration
67:02 - so the first tool that we are going to
67:04 - look at is the directory tool
67:06 - so the directory tool is used to return
67:09 - a list of all the files that are present
67:11 - in the specified directory
67:13 - it returns the file name and other
67:15 - information about each file uh like its
67:18 - size the date it was created the last
67:21 - modified date and many more information
67:23 - okay so let's see how do we use it
67:26 - uh first of all grab the directory tool
67:29 - from the you know tab into your workflow
67:30 - workspace then what you need to do is in
67:33 - this configuration tab you have to
67:35 - specify the directory of the folder from
67:37 - where you want to get the files okay so
67:39 - in my case i have already specified the
67:41 - folder that is this files folder in the
67:43 - altrix
67:45 - click on ok
67:46 - now if you want specific files to be
67:48 - there only then you can specify the
67:50 - files
67:51 - otherwise uh this asterisk is over here
67:54 - that means uh any of the files any of
67:57 - the file names dot any of the file
67:59 - extensions would be taken
68:02 - if you want to um
68:03 - include the sub directories like if you
68:05 - want to search for the specified file
68:07 - types in directories
68:08 - that are specified within the specified
68:10 - directory then this box um
68:13 - is checked otherwise leave it unchecked
68:15 - okay
68:17 - it's only for the specific files but we
68:18 - are going for the generic ones so no
68:20 - need to include the sub directories
68:22 - let's just click on run so what would
68:24 - happen is uh you would get this kind of
68:27 - an output that is the list of all of
68:29 - these uh
68:31 - files that are present in this directory
68:33 - the full path the directory the name of
68:36 - the file along with its extension
68:39 - the
68:40 - creation time the time when it was last
68:43 - accessed last written
68:45 - the size
68:47 - and some of the attributes like it is it
68:50 - encrypted is it compressed is it
68:52 - archived is it hidden is it normal
68:55 - uh is it
68:56 - offline is it read-only
68:58 - uh and so on so these are all the fields
69:02 - that we would be getting so this is for
69:03 - the generic files let us now search for
69:05 - the specific files
69:07 - okay so we are going with the extension
69:09 - as you can see yx md files are present
69:11 - over here so instead of
69:14 - all the files
69:15 - my
69:16 - xmd files are the only ones that i am
69:18 - interested in right now and in the sub
69:20 - directories as well
69:22 - then click on run
69:24 - so what i would be getting is
69:27 - only the yxmd file so there are a total
69:29 - of seven yx md files in the sub
69:31 - directories and the directory of this
69:33 - particular folder so this is what i am
69:35 - getting through the directory tool
69:38 - right
69:39 - let's just click ctrl s to save it
69:42 - next tool that we have is the date time
69:44 - tool so as we have discussed about the
69:47 - date time already uh in the data types
69:51 - video in ultrix so this date time now
69:55 - tool is used to return a single record
69:57 - that is the date or the time
70:00 - at the time when the workflow was run
70:03 - and you can just convert the value into
70:05 - the string format of your choosing
70:07 - so basically this is useful that once
70:10 - you are creating any report and you want
70:12 - to
70:13 - show the date or the time of its
70:14 - creation then you can use this
70:17 - particular tool okay so let's just bring
70:19 - in this tool this is the daytime now
70:21 - tool
70:22 - over here it
70:23 - requires us to specify two things the
70:25 - language in which we want the date and
70:27 - time and the format in which we want
70:28 - that is the output format
70:30 - so let's just get the
70:33 - format like this where i'm getting the
70:35 - date as well as the time
70:37 - now click on run or use the shortcut
70:39 - ctrl r so we would be getting
70:42 - a column with today's date and the time
70:44 - at which this was run okay
70:47 - now in case you decide to change the
70:49 - language right now i have taken english
70:51 - but let me just
70:52 - go with spanish okay
70:54 - click on ok
70:55 - and now what we are getting is the same
70:58 - output but to get a different output
71:00 - let's just choose a different format
71:02 - like this
71:04 - click on run
71:05 - and now what we are getting is a
71:07 - different format like the month name is
71:08 - in spanish right now
71:11 - so this is what we are getting this is
71:13 - the usage of the um date time now tool
71:17 - let's just press ctrl s to save it
71:20 - and move on to the next tool which is
71:21 - the text input tool now what is the
71:24 - usage of this text input tool
71:27 - it is used to manually enter the text to
71:29 - create small data files for input
71:33 - it can be useful in
71:34 - like testing and creating the lookup
71:36 - tables while we are building the
71:38 - workflow the data input from the text
71:41 - input tool saves within the workflow so
71:43 - you can share the workflow without
71:44 - having to provide an input file okay
71:48 - so let's see how do we work with it uh
71:50 - first of all let's just get this input
71:52 - data that is this text input tool
71:54 - over here now once we have got it over
71:57 - here we would be getting these different
71:58 - options like this is the option to
72:00 - import if you want to import any of the
72:02 - files but treat it as the input that has
72:05 - been manually taken into the workflow so
72:07 - when we share the workflow the file gets
72:10 - shared as well we do not have to
72:11 - externally share the file
72:13 - right then we have the copy once we have
72:15 - entered the values if you want to copy
72:17 - it if you have already copied the values
72:18 - from somewhere and just want to paste it
72:20 - over here that's
72:22 - this paste option you can use the delete
72:24 - and the insert options are there as well
72:26 - so delete is to delete any of the data
72:28 - that's existing and insert to insert the
72:29 - columns so let's just insert a
72:32 - row first of all
72:33 - so this is the row that's been inserted
72:35 - if you just double click over here you
72:36 - can start adding the values so what i'm
72:39 - going to add is name
72:41 - let's say sameer then i'm going to add a
72:44 - value
72:45 - let's say 12 and then i'm going to add a
72:48 - city let's say delhi okay so this is my
72:51 - first value that i have entered read
72:53 - similarly i can add another value let's
72:55 - say
72:58 - a name
73:00 - a value
73:01 - and a city
73:02 - so mumbai okay
73:05 - so this is how i can keep on adding the
73:07 - records manually
73:09 - uh these are the field names right now
73:11 - taken as field one field two and field
73:13 - three but if you want you can change
73:15 - them as well by double clicking on them
73:17 - so the first field name is going to be
73:19 - name
73:20 - the second one is going to be age and
73:23 - the third one is going to be
73:25 - city okay so this is the record that i
73:27 - have got if i just click on run then
73:30 - what would be i getting is this uh hold
73:32 - record in the form of a table like this
73:36 - now let's just see how the import
73:37 - function works so let's just click on
73:39 - import this is the sheet excel sheet
73:41 - that i want to import this is the one
73:43 - that we just exported
73:45 - uh in the form of an excel file so the
73:47 - consumer one is what i'm going to import
73:50 - so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this
73:52 - tool so that's where the whole sheet was
73:55 - not imported but i'm happy with it
73:57 - let's just click on run
73:58 - now once we do that
74:00 - this whole table is actually a part
74:04 - of this
74:06 - tool this input
74:08 - tool okay a text input tool now this
74:11 - means there is no external file being
74:13 - associated with this if you just delete
74:15 - the excel file then also there would be
74:17 - no change in altrix because altrix has
74:20 - created a copy using the text input tool
74:22 - of this particular dataset right so this
74:25 - is uh the importance of the text input
74:27 - tool over the normal input data tool
74:30 - that we were using up till now
74:32 - but there is an added disadvantage as
74:34 - well because in this case alteryx create
74:36 - another memory of itself to store this
74:39 - data so there would be an additional
74:41 - memory requirement so it depends upon
74:43 - you and the requirement of the
74:46 - particular workflow that whether you
74:49 - want to use the text input tool or the
74:50 - input data tool okay
74:53 - now let's uh save it yeah in case you
74:56 - want to delete it suppose i just don't
74:58 - want this order id column so delete the
75:00 - columns so you can just select the
75:02 - column
75:03 - and delete it
75:04 - if you want to select uh delete a
75:06 - particular row like i want to delete
75:08 - this row number six delete row so the
75:11 - row number six has been deleted okay so
75:13 - this is how the things work in the text
75:15 - input tool you can actually make changes
75:18 - into the data set as well without
75:19 - affecting the original excel file
75:23 - you can copy it and if i just open up my
75:25 - notepad
75:28 - i would be able to paste it as well
75:30 - like six was selected so this has been
75:32 - copied you want to select multiple
75:34 - records like this
75:37 - and copy them
75:39 - then go to notepad
75:41 - and paste them so you would be able to
75:43 - create a copy for them uh for yourself
75:45 - as well okay
75:47 - let's just remove it right now
75:49 - so that's about the text input tool that
75:51 - you need to know now let us talk about
75:53 - the map input tool which is the final
75:55 - tool in this particular group so what is
75:58 - the map input tool as you can see the
76:01 - name itself is suggesting
76:04 - it is used to draw or select the desired
76:06 - map object to use as an input in a
76:08 - workflow
76:09 - you can either draw or select a point
76:12 - line or polygon to form a map that
76:13 - displays a reference base map okay
76:16 - so let's just get this tool map input
76:18 - tool over here and as soon as we get
76:20 - there uh there would be a map
76:23 - you can just select the base map right
76:25 - now it's selected to none
76:27 - let's just select ultra stock so you'd
76:29 - be getting a map you can hover over it
76:31 - uh to just you know
76:32 - load any of the countries or the
76:34 - continents that you like so i'm just
76:36 - going to go all the way to india
76:39 - using the zoom buttons you can zoom in
76:41 - or zoom out
76:43 - and get a location let's say kanpur
76:47 - and here i want to point to kanpur so uh
76:50 - right now as you can see the mode has
76:52 - been set to draw so i can draw anything
76:54 - so we can just get a point to draw it on
76:56 - kanpur
76:57 - over here
76:58 - and if you want to provide it a name so
77:01 - let me just provide it a name as home
77:03 - click on save
77:05 - and that's it you can click on run to
77:07 - run the workflow so what will it do is
77:09 - it will create this kind of a value for
77:11 - you the label is home and the spatial
77:14 - object is point view browse tool map tab
77:17 - so the spatial object has been created
77:20 - using the map input tool hello everyone
77:22 - welcome back to the altrix tutorials in
77:25 - this video we are going to talk about a
77:27 - few tools from the preparation tab in
77:30 - ultrix
77:31 - so first of all we have discussed the
77:33 - tools of the in-out tab that means the
77:35 - tools that would be handy when we are
77:38 - importing the data or exporting it
77:41 - now once we have imported the data we
77:43 - may need to perform some manipulations
77:45 - over the data so we would be looking at
77:47 - the tools that would help us to do the
77:49 - exact same thing the preparation tools
77:52 - okay
77:53 - so first tool that we are going to look
77:55 - for is the auto field tool the auto
77:57 - field tool we have already discussed in
78:00 - the data types video that it is used to
78:02 - read through all of the records of an
78:04 - input and set the field type to the
78:06 - smallest possible size that is related
78:09 - to the data contained in the column
78:11 - so what we are going to do is in this
78:13 - particular video see the practical
78:15 - application of the auto field tool so
78:17 - first of all what i have done is i have
78:19 - already input the data
78:22 - using the uh input data tool so because
78:26 - this is the step that we have done
78:27 - multiple times till now so we do not
78:30 - need to again see it
78:32 - next i have cleansed this data like in
78:34 - the subcategory there were some of the
78:37 - trailing white spaces so i have cleaned
78:39 - it and
78:40 - let me just show you how to clean it
78:42 - real quick the use of this data
78:44 - cleansing tool so let me just remove
78:45 - this tool once
78:48 - from here
78:49 - now how can you clean the data is you
78:51 - can just bring in the data cleansing
78:53 - tool or what you can do is wait for um
78:56 - alteryx to automatically bring it in
78:58 - okay so let's see how to do that
79:00 - so first of all uh you have inputted the
79:02 - data then you need to just search for
79:04 - the inconsistent blocks that is the
79:06 - subcategory go on to these three dots
79:08 - click on data cleanse remove unwanted
79:10 - characters
79:11 - leading slash trailing white space click
79:13 - on apply now once the changes have been
79:16 - applied click on this green tick icon
79:17 - that's okay so now the changes would be
79:20 - applied and you would see the data
79:22 - cleansing tool has been brought in
79:24 - automatically okay
79:26 - now its configuration panel is also
79:28 - present there which you can use to
79:30 - further clean the values but
79:33 - uh now our data is clean so we won't be
79:35 - using it anymore right the next thing we
79:38 - are going to do is use the auto field
79:40 - tool
79:41 - so let's just bring in the auto field
79:42 - tool over here
79:44 - now if you see the data preparation
79:46 - tools all have two anchors the input
79:49 - anchor and the output angle the input
79:51 - anchor is used to take the input data
79:53 - and the output anchor is used to present
79:55 - it further okay
79:56 - so this is the autofill tool as soon as
79:58 - i brought it up there is this
80:00 - configuration panel now here i can
80:02 - select the values through which you want
80:04 - to change the field type okay
80:06 - let's just clear all the values and
80:07 - select only category subcategory and
80:10 - segment from here
80:11 - now once we have selected these fields
80:13 - click on run
80:15 - now what will it do is it would show us
80:17 - the message box that's okay
80:20 - now let's just see the messages that um
80:22 - would actually tell us what changes it
80:24 - had made so uh the field type of segment
80:28 - has been changed to string for eight
80:30 - characters field type of category change
80:32 - to string or 15 characters and that of
80:34 - category to string of 11 characters so
80:37 - this is uh what the change is made by
80:40 - the auto field tool the
80:45 - the changes that it has made in these
80:46 - three fields has been shown to us in
80:48 - case we select all these fields let's
80:50 - select all
80:51 - and click on run for the auto field tool
80:53 - so what we would be getting is
80:57 - this again go to the messages so we
80:59 - would be getting that
81:01 - what fields it has changed to the all
81:04 - these records okay so you can see some
81:05 - of them have been changed to string some
81:07 - of them to variable string
81:09 - and so on
81:10 - like this it has made the changes
81:12 - automatically so this is the use of the
81:13 - auto field tool and the data cleansing
81:16 - tool in the preparation tab
81:18 - now uh let's just save this using ctrl s
81:22 - and move on to the next tool that is the
81:24 - filter tool so filter tool as the name
81:27 - suggests is used to select the data
81:30 - based upon a particular condition
81:33 - uh the rows of the data that made the
81:34 - condition are output to the
81:37 - uh
81:38 - screen in the form of a true anchor and
81:41 - those that do not meet the criteria are
81:43 - output in the form of a false anchor
81:46 - so if we just bring up this filter tool
81:48 - over here you can see it has three
81:50 - anchors the input anchor and in the
81:52 - output it has two anchors the true
81:54 - anchor and the false anchor so we
81:55 - specify a base condition and if the data
81:58 - meets the base condition then it goes
82:00 - into the true anchor otherwise it goes
82:02 - into the false anchor okay so let's see
82:04 - with the example
82:06 - let's click on this filter tool
82:08 - over here so this kind of a
82:10 - configuration box would be there now
82:12 - there are two kinds of filters that we
82:13 - can apply the basic filter or the custom
82:16 - filter in the case of the basic filter
82:17 - we can specify the basic information
82:19 - like if the um
82:22 - criteria is being matched or not if you
82:26 - want to apply some complex operations
82:28 - then we use the custom filters custom
82:30 - filters allow us to add functionalities
82:33 - to add mathematical functions the
82:36 - boolean values the if else statements
82:38 - and many more things which we would be
82:40 - of course seeing one by one but first of
82:42 - all let's take a look at the basic
82:44 - filter
82:45 - so if you remember uh we had a column
82:47 - called category
82:49 - in this we had some categories like the
82:51 - furniture technology and the office of
82:53 - place so what i'm going to do is i'm
82:55 - going to assign the furnitures
82:58 - separately that means all the categories
83:00 - where furniture is the category it would
83:02 - be assigned to a true value right so
83:04 - from the basic filter let's just select
83:06 - the column the column name is going to
83:08 - be the category column
83:10 - and equals
83:11 - let's just type in the value furniture
83:15 - okay now once you have typed it you can
83:18 - just click on run to run the workflow
83:21 - and then you would see that
83:24 - okay
83:26 - we have two anchors the true anchor if
83:28 - you just hover over it it would give you
83:30 - the category furniture and then we have
83:32 - is the false anchor for the category
83:34 - furniture okay
83:36 - now here are all the records that are
83:37 - being displayed in the output panel for
83:39 - the true value here you can see this is
83:40 - the true value being shown
83:42 - there are a
83:44 - 1113 records that belong to the category
83:48 - furniture okay
83:49 - so if you hover over it the category
83:51 - here is furniture only furniture
83:54 - all the way furniture but if you go to
83:56 - the false value
83:57 - then what we have is the category
83:59 - technology and office applies
84:02 - great let's just add another filter
84:04 - anchor over here into the false part
84:07 - where what we would be doing is adding
84:09 - another base filter on the basis of the
84:11 - category let's just select the category
84:13 - again
84:15 - and it must be equal to technology
84:18 - technology
84:21 - over here okay
84:22 - click on run
84:26 - and here
84:28 - so now we again have these true false
84:31 - values for this so in the true there
84:33 - would be the technology values
84:35 - and in the false there would be the
84:37 - office applies values so this is how we
84:39 - have used the basic filter tool to
84:42 - actually create three separate uh values
84:46 - for these like the furniture categories
84:48 - are separate the
84:49 - technology is separate and the office
84:51 - supplies is now separate and we separate
84:53 - records okay so this is how the basic uh
84:55 - filter is being used now what i'm going
84:57 - to do is just i'm going to copy these
84:59 - two fields or these two tools that is
85:01 - the input tool and the data cleansing
85:03 - tool into a new workflow
85:06 - and show you the demonstration of the
85:10 - filter tool for the custom filter okay
85:13 - so let's just bring in our tool over
85:15 - here connect it
85:19 - and here let's select a custom filter
85:22 - right so here is the effects which you
85:24 - can use to apply any of these conditions
85:26 - or any of these functions like you want
85:28 - to convert it
85:31 - right or you want to perform any kind of
85:34 - a manipulation over here you want to
85:37 - apply any of the conditional statements
85:39 - if you want to
85:41 - allow any date time
85:43 - uh applications any of the file
85:44 - applications that you can do over here
85:47 - like the string functions
85:50 - so let's just use the count words
85:53 - so i basically needed to count the words
85:56 - okay and then
85:57 - from this x you can just select the
85:59 - existing columns so i want it to select
86:01 - the count words for the city
86:03 - click on run
86:07 - and then
86:11 - uh it's going to give you the values for
86:15 - of course there won't be any false
86:16 - values right now because there could not
86:18 - be any false values for the count
86:20 - function
86:22 - and it would give you
86:24 - the count of the characters of the
86:26 - cities right
86:31 - or basically what we can do is actually
86:34 - use any kind of a basic filter like
86:37 - let's say if the profit
86:39 - is greater than equal to one
86:42 - so that would be a profit
86:44 - right so we have written a basic filter
86:46 - query but if you want to see how it is
86:48 - looking in the custom filter there you
86:50 - can apply it profit is greater than
86:51 - equal to one
86:52 - now if you just run it
86:54 - what you would be getting is in the two
86:56 - values the true and the false values
86:58 - so that means the records where we are
87:01 - getting a profit and the records where
87:02 - we are getting a loss in the case of the
87:04 - true are the ones where we are getting a
87:06 - profit here you can see all of these
87:07 - values we are getting a profit
87:09 - but in these values we are getting a
87:11 - loss you can see this is a loss okay so
87:14 - you just go to the messages um
87:17 - you would get that in the 4008 records
87:19 - there were the true values that means
87:21 - there is where we are getting a profit
87:24 - and the remaining 1183 values written
87:26 - false that means these are the values
87:28 - where we are getting a loss so this is
87:31 - the usage of the filter tool
87:34 - in altrix and this is how we use it so
87:36 - that's all for this video thanks for
87:38 - watching
87:40 - hello everyone welcome back to the
87:42 - altrix tutorials in this video we are
87:44 - going to discuss about some more uh
87:47 - tools that are present in the data
87:49 - preparation group in excel
87:51 - uh in ultrix so the first tool that we
87:53 - are going to look in this is the formula
87:56 - tool
87:56 - so the formula tool is actually used to
87:59 - create
88:00 - new columns uh update the columns or
88:03 - use the expressions to perform a variety
88:06 - of the calculations on the already
88:08 - existing values
88:11 - that are present in the columns okay so
88:15 - we can use it to apply conditional
88:17 - statements convert uh the data type from
88:20 - one to another format the dates extract
88:22 - file paths apply algorithms clean the
88:25 - data apply the validations or
88:29 - perform the tests etc okay so let us see
88:32 - how are we going to use this formula
88:34 - tool
88:36 - so right now i have got the same data
88:39 - set that is the consumer sheet from the
88:42 - sample store data set okay
88:45 - and i have cleansed it
88:47 - that is removed the inconsistencies now
88:49 - let's just bring up our formula tool
88:52 - to here
88:54 - and in this what i'm going to do is uh
88:56 - in the configuration panel i have two
88:58 - options either i can just select a
89:00 - column and that data would be
89:03 - overwritten or i can add a new column so
89:05 - what i'm going to do is i'm actually i'm
89:07 - going to add a new column so add a
89:09 - column and then you go to specify the
89:12 - name of the column so that's going to be
89:16 - profit
89:17 - slash
89:18 - loss okay
89:20 - and here what i'm going to do is apply a
89:22 - conditional statement
89:24 - that
89:26 - uh
89:28 - this conditional statement
89:31 - if the value of the profit so for
89:34 - getting the column names we can simply
89:36 - just use a square bracket
89:38 - so we have the profit value over here
89:42 - if the profit value is greater than
89:45 - equals to 0
89:46 - then
89:47 - the value in this column is going to be
89:49 - profit
89:52 - else it is going to be
89:54 - loss okay
89:56 - like this and whatever the tax for value
89:58 - you want you need to just write it in
90:00 - the single quotes okay
90:02 - so the size we can just specify over
90:06 - here it's going to be the data type we
90:08 - can check is
90:11 - going to be the variable string
90:12 - and click on run
90:16 - now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6
90:19 - seconds to be precise
90:20 - and as you can see
90:23 - uh we should be getting
90:25 - a new column over here
90:30 - and here on the very last uh you can see
90:33 - the column profit and loss if the values
90:36 - are positive then we are getting the
90:38 - value profit if it is negative then we
90:40 - are getting the value loss okay
90:43 - uh so here is a warning in the profit
90:45 - that
90:46 - the there was a large value over here
90:48 - but it has been rounded up by alteryx
90:50 - for clarity okay so that's why the
90:53 - red
90:54 - uh
90:55 - is being shown over here the rate mark
90:57 - has been shown over here so this is one
90:59 - way of using the formula tool right um
91:02 - just like this you can actually make
91:05 - changes into the existing data like um
91:10 - right now if you just don't want to add
91:12 - an extra column so we want to apply
91:14 - another formula
91:16 - and the thing is that i want to get
91:20 - the profit and the loss the same thing
91:23 - but in this column only that is the
91:25 - value that is showing me profit in that
91:27 - value only i want this to happen so i
91:30 - can just select the column
91:31 - and here i'm just going to select the
91:33 - profit column okay
91:35 - now if i just click on run then what
91:37 - would happen is the values in that
91:39 - particular column would be overwritten
91:43 - okay so there is an error
91:46 - uh the thing is that
91:48 - we wanted string value but the field is
91:50 - numeric so that's why it's not happening
91:52 - so let me just change it a little bit
91:55 - that is
91:57 - over here
91:59 - if there is a profit then i want 100 to
92:02 - be written over there
92:04 - else i want 0 to be written over here
92:07 - okay or i can just actually you know
92:12 - uh
92:12 - change its data type as well like it's
92:15 - double so 100 and 0 would be okay
92:17 - let's click on run
92:21 - now if you just go to this output panel
92:25 - and here we have only two values hundred
92:27 - and zero hundred and zero so this is how
92:29 - you can actually update the existing
92:31 - values or create a new column
92:33 - now in case you want to remove any
92:35 - formula you can just go to that formula
92:37 - and here is this delete button you can
92:39 - just delete that
92:40 - and now if you again run it then the
92:43 - changes that were made initially would
92:45 - be overwritten and you would be getting
92:47 - the original values of the profit that
92:49 - were present in the call
92:51 - so this is how we work with the formula
92:53 - tool
92:54 - to either add new columns or update the
92:57 - existing columns right
92:59 - next tool that we are going to talk
93:00 - about is the sample tool so let's just
93:03 - go to the sample tool
93:04 - now what is the sample tool it is used
93:07 - to limit the data stream to a specified
93:09 - number percentage or a random set of
93:11 - rows
93:12 - uh also if you want a selected
93:14 - configuration to the columns so
93:18 - to be applied you can group the columns
93:20 - using the sample tool so let's just get
93:22 - the sample tool
93:23 - over here
93:25 - and as soon as we get it this is the
93:27 - configuration panel that we are getting
93:28 - the first option is the first n rows
93:31 - uh it returns every row in the data from
93:34 - the beginning to the data through the
93:35 - value of n
93:36 - like you can specify a value of n here
93:38 - you can see
93:39 - right now if you just run it so it would
93:42 - return the first hundred rows as you can
93:44 - see first hundred has been shown over
93:45 - here because the value of n was hundred
93:47 - but if we just set it to 10
93:50 - and then run it so what will it do is it
93:53 - would just show you the first 10 rows
93:56 - okay so you can set the value of n
93:59 - next option is last and rows which of
94:01 - course is used
94:02 - to show us the last
94:04 - n rows the value of n which you can
94:06 - specify
94:08 - as per your wish
94:09 - next is skip first n rows which returns
94:13 - all the rows in the data that start
94:16 - after the specified number of rows
94:18 - next we have one of every n rows that
94:21 - means return the first row of every
94:23 - group of n rows like if i just select n
94:26 - so the whole record would be
94:29 - split into groups of 10 and the first
94:32 - row in each group would be returned to
94:34 - me
94:35 - so if you just run it
94:38 - then we would be able to see the changes
94:40 - like
94:42 - through this row id like 1 then 12 then
94:44 - 26 and 48 this is how the rows are being
94:47 - returned to me okay
94:49 - next is one in chan one in n chance to
94:52 - include each row
94:54 - that means
94:55 - it would return randomly it would
94:57 - randomly determine if each row is
94:59 - included in the sample or not so the
95:02 - random values are being
95:04 - uh returned to me as you can see from
95:06 - the row id itself 11 then 20 then 21
95:09 - randomly the rows are being
95:11 - returned to me
95:12 - okay so um
95:16 - then we have the first n percent of rows
95:19 - that means it returns the n percent in
95:22 - this case the 10 percent
95:24 - of rows it requires the data to pass
95:26 - through the tool twice like once we
95:29 - calculate the count of rows and then to
95:30 - return the specified percent of rows
95:33 - okay then we can just run it to get the
95:35 - n percent of rows that's the ten percent
95:37 - of the rows or of the total values okay
95:40 - so they were around 5000 uh
95:43 - 191 records so 519 records that's the 10
95:46 - of the records have been displayed over
95:48 - here okay
95:49 - next we have is the group by option so
95:51 - if you want to group it uh on the basis
95:53 - of some column that you can do let's
95:55 - just group it by category
95:58 - and
96:00 - just get the first 10 rows to be grouped
96:02 - by category we can click on run
96:05 - so this is what we would be getting
96:07 - in the output
96:10 - okay
96:12 - so furniture categories then the office
96:14 - supplies categories and the technology
96:15 - categories have been used to group by
96:17 - the values so this is how the sample
96:20 - tool works for us
96:23 - ah
96:24 - next we have is the
96:27 - sort tool
96:28 - so the sort tool is actually
96:31 - very important and as the name suggests
96:33 - it is used to sort the data
96:35 - so um
96:37 - let's see how it works it actually takes
96:40 - two
96:41 - things into consideration let's just get
96:43 - the sort tool over here
96:45 - it takes two things into consideration
96:47 - the name and the order so basically
96:50 - uh any of the
96:52 - name
96:53 - of the field
96:54 - that you want to sort and in which order
96:56 - you want to sort if in the ascending
96:57 - order of in the descending order okay
97:00 - so let's just uh delete this tool once
97:03 - and let's see how we manually apply it
97:04 - like without using this tool okay so now
97:07 - if we just run this
97:09 - we would be getting our hands on the
97:11 - data set
97:14 - okay
97:17 - yeah so if you want to sort the values
97:19 - like i want to sort it on the basis of
97:21 - the sales so let's just go to the sales
97:23 - column
97:24 - or click on these three dots
97:26 - go to sort
97:27 - and i want to sort it on the basis of
97:29 - the ascending order then click on apply
97:32 - so once we do that we can click on this
97:34 - red
97:35 - this green tick button
97:37 - and you would see that it has been
97:39 - applied if you just click on the output
97:42 - actually run the workflow
97:46 - so here is what we would be getting the
97:48 - sorted values
97:50 - like you can see the value have been
97:51 - sorted on the basis of the sales the
97:53 - ascending order the sort tool has
97:56 - already been applied and the name is
97:57 - taken as sales and the order is taken as
97:59 - ascending so this is the usage of the
98:01 - sort tool that's all for this video
98:03 - thanks for watching
98:06 - hello everyone welcome to altrix
98:07 - tutorials in this video we are going to
98:10 - see the three most important tools in
98:13 - the data preparation tab of altrics the
98:16 - first tool that we are going to see is
98:18 - the unique tool
98:19 - as the name suggests
98:21 - unique is used to distinguish that
98:23 - whether a data record is unique or if it
98:26 - is duplicate by grouping on one or more
98:29 - specified fields
98:31 - then
98:32 - it sorts those fields so if you want
98:34 - some of the fields to be unique then you
98:36 - can simply check it using this unique
98:38 - tool that whether the particular field
98:41 - or particular column is actually
98:44 - containing unique values or not
98:46 - so how can we use it let's just get this
98:48 - tool
98:50 - uh just like the filter tool we have
98:51 - used the unique tool also has three
98:54 - anchors one is the anchor where it gets
98:56 - the data the next two anchors are the
98:57 - unique and the duplicate anchors as you
98:59 - can see the u and the d
99:02 - so it basically shows you that
99:04 - which of the values are unique and which
99:06 - of them are not okay
99:08 - now this is the configuration panel from
99:10 - where you can just select the values
99:12 - like i would select the customer name
99:15 - i want to check that if the customer is
99:17 - returning to me or not
99:19 - so if i just click on run
99:21 - then
99:23 - okay
99:24 - i'm getting uh some of the unique values
99:26 - so there are 409 records where the
99:28 - customer name is unique so there are 409
99:31 - unique customers i'm also getting
99:34 - duplicates that means the customers we
99:36 - have are the returning customers and now
99:39 - all of these values are grouped together
99:40 - as a customer name like first you can
99:42 - see aaron bergman
99:44 - so the customer uh whatever purchases
99:47 - the customer has made is being grouped
99:50 - together by his name then
99:52 - by this second customer third customer
99:54 - and so on okay so these are the uni
99:56 - customers the total of 409 customers are
99:59 - there and they're returning to me again
100:00 - and again to purchase a total of 10 000
100:03 - uh record items okay so this is what the
100:07 - unique tool helps us to understand about
100:09 - the data now uh you have applied it on
100:12 - one field but if you want you can apply
100:14 - it on multiple fields like for the
100:16 - category also i want to apply
100:18 - then click on run
100:20 - now what will happen is
100:22 - uh we would be getting the unique values
100:24 - for
100:26 - uh the combination of both right so now
100:29 - the in the unique value over here the
100:32 - total of 1136 records have been
100:34 - displayed the customer name uh if they
100:37 - have purchased from each of these
100:38 - categories right so in the category
100:40 - there are these three categories
100:42 - furniture office supplies and technology
100:43 - and the customer name as you can see
100:46 - is same
100:48 - for the three and the remaining are the
100:50 - duplicates which means the customer has
100:52 - made another purchase in the same
100:54 - category of the items so this is the
100:56 - usage of the unique tool okay
100:59 - now let's move on to the next tool that
101:01 - is the imputation tool now what is the
101:03 - imputation tool
101:06 - imputation tool is used to replace a
101:08 - specified value within one or more
101:11 - numeric data fields with another
101:13 - specified value so basically it's used
101:16 - that if your data is inconsistent
101:18 - and contain some of the null values then
101:20 - what you can do is actually clean the
101:22 - data set
101:23 - so you can replace the null values with
101:26 - either the average of the values of that
101:28 - particular column or
101:30 - um basically with any value that you
101:33 - want okay so let's just get the
101:34 - imputation tool to get a better look at
101:37 - how it works
101:38 - over here
101:40 - so here you would get the fields which
101:42 - you want to impute now only the numeric
101:44 - fields would be there because that's
101:46 - what we get for the imputation rule now
101:48 - what value you want to replace if there
101:50 - are null values you can replace those
101:52 - null values but if the null values are
101:53 - not present then you can use a user
101:56 - specified value next we have is the
101:58 - replace with value that is with which
102:00 - value you want to replace it so average
102:02 - that means average of all values not
102:04 - including the incoming values to replace
102:07 - okay so basically
102:09 - the values that are already existing
102:10 - those average would be taken and that
102:12 - would be replaced in place of null
102:14 - values we have a median value that is
102:16 - the value separating the higher half
102:18 - from the lower half or the middle value
102:20 - we have the mode value that the value
102:22 - that appears most often
102:24 - or if you want to use a specified value
102:26 - that you want to replace that you can do
102:28 - okay so what i'm going to do is actually
102:30 - just work for the
102:32 - quantity part over here
102:34 - since i know that my data set is clean
102:36 - it has no null values so i'm just going
102:38 - to check a user specified value of 7
102:41 - and i'm going to specify another value
102:43 - for it that is going to be 8 okay that's
102:46 - a minor change that i'm just going to do
102:48 - of course it would be undone because it
102:50 - has no meaning it's just to show you the
102:52 - usage of this tool
102:54 - next we have these two check boxes that
102:56 - is include imputed value in the
102:57 - indicator field that means there would
102:59 - be a field that would be added to
103:01 - specify whether or not a value has been
103:03 - imputed
103:04 - or you want to output the imputed value
103:06 - in a separate field that means the
103:08 - original field would be as it is but in
103:11 - a separate field the value would be
103:13 - outputted the imputed value okay so
103:15 - first of all let's just select the first
103:17 - option and run it to see how it works
103:21 - here it would take few seconds and then
103:27 - let's just see if it has worked for the
103:30 - quantity
103:31 - so now here we can see that um
103:34 - it's eight and the quantity indicator is
103:37 - showing 1 that means the change has been
103:39 - made over here and on the rest of the
103:41 - values it's showing 0. again it's
103:43 - showing 1 that means the value was
103:45 - originally 7 but now it has been changed
103:46 - to 8.
103:48 - so this is how the imputed value
103:50 - indicator field works next option is the
103:52 - output imputed values as a separate
103:54 - field so we can just select this option
103:56 - and click on run
103:58 - now what would happen is
104:02 - we would be getting a separate value in
104:04 - which the quantity value original field
104:06 - would be as it is like here it was seven
104:09 - but in the new values the field would uh
104:11 - new field the values would be eight over
104:13 - here from seven it changed to eight so
104:16 - this is how the imputation works but
104:19 - if the null values are present on your
104:21 - data or if you want to replace of any of
104:23 - the values numeric values only then you
104:25 - can use this imputation tool
104:27 - right
104:28 - now last but not the least we have the
104:30 - multi-field binning tool now what is
104:32 - this tool
104:35 - it is actually uh used to replicate some
104:38 - of the functionality of the tile tool
104:40 - okay
104:41 - um
104:42 - basically it allows the data to be
104:44 - binned on multiple fields
104:48 - mainly it is used for the predictive
104:49 - tool set
104:51 - multi-field billing tool accepts only
104:54 - the numeric fields just like the
104:56 - imputation tool we have just seen
104:58 - for the purpose of pinning we can pin
105:01 - the fields either
105:02 - in the form of the equal records or
105:04 - equal intervals so what is a bin
105:07 - uh
105:08 - if you just take a look at a histogram
105:10 - let's just bring up a histogram here
105:13 - right so this is a histogram and as you
105:16 - can see it shows the salary
105:19 - and the number of the players so 0 to 10
105:23 - is actually an interval 10 to 20 is an
105:26 - interval right so
105:28 - this is called a bin histogram is
105:31 - depicted using bins and in order to
105:34 - create those bins
105:36 - we are going to use the multi-field
105:38 - binning tool in ultrix so let's see how
105:40 - it works
105:42 - uh let's just get this
105:45 - over here
105:46 - and it would get all the numeric fields
105:48 - i'm going to do it on the basis of the
105:50 - sales
105:51 - the number of the tiles or the bins that
105:53 - you want to create so i want to create
105:55 - it 10
105:57 - tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two
106:00 - options either equal records or equal
106:02 - intervals equal records what it says
106:04 - that the input records are divided into
106:07 - the specified number of pins each bin is
106:09 - assigned to
106:10 - assign the same number of records okay
106:12 - so the number of records would be equal
106:14 - in each bin
106:16 - um
106:17 - then we have equal intervals that means
106:19 - the minimum and the maximum values
106:21 - of the selected fields are determined
106:24 - and the records are assigned based upon
106:26 - these ranges so if we go with equal
106:29 - intervals that would be like more
106:31 - appropriate to get
106:33 - a varied length of the histogram
106:35 - then you can click on run
106:39 - so after a few seconds you would be
106:41 - getting
106:42 - this field
106:47 - uh it's on the base of sales right
106:51 - uh here is the field uh sales style num
106:54 - so what is the tile number all right now
106:56 - it's one
106:57 - and as you can see this one has um
107:00 - higher sales value of 1706 that's why
107:02 - it's been assigned to tile two
107:05 - and just like this if you just scroll
107:06 - over it you will get some other numbers
107:08 - as well
107:10 - so it's one two
107:12 - one and two and that was five over here
107:16 - it has a higher range of six thousand
107:17 - that's why it's been given a number five
107:19 - so just like this
107:21 - we have binned our sales records if you
107:23 - just get it into equal number of records
107:25 - and click on run
107:27 - so
107:28 - the records would be given
107:30 - two different bins
107:32 - uh equally like as you can see the
107:34 - different bins have been assigned
107:37 - the different bins have been assigned to
107:38 - each of these sales values okay
107:41 - so as we have specified 10 so uh the 10
107:45 - tiles have been created and the maximum
107:47 - of a thousand tiles we can create
107:49 - so any number between
107:51 - 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the
107:54 - function of the multi-field binning tool
107:57 - and these are all the major tools that
107:59 - you need to know about in the
108:01 - preparation group in alteryx that's all
108:03 - for this video and that's all for the
108:05 - preparation tools in altrix in the next
108:07 - video we would be looking at the other
108:10 - group which is the join group that's all
108:12 - for this video thanks for watching
108:16 - hello everyone welcome to alteryx
108:18 - tutorials in this video we are going to
108:21 - take a look at some of the tools
108:23 - that are present in the join tab of the
108:26 - alteryx tools
108:27 - in the previous videos we have already
108:29 - seen the in-out tab and the preparation
108:32 - tab and their individual tools that are
108:34 - going to be useful for us
108:36 - while preparing the workflows in altrix
108:40 - in this video we are going to start a
108:41 - new tab that is the join tab so without
108:44 - any further ado let us start with the
108:46 - video in this video we are going to talk
108:48 - about a very special tool known as the
108:50 - append fields tool this append fields
108:53 - tool is present in the join tab as you
108:55 - can see denoted by a purple color
108:58 - now before starting with this tool what
109:00 - i have already done is i have already
109:02 - input my data that is the sample
109:05 - superstore data
109:07 - and from that data set i have taken the
109:09 - orders sheet
109:11 - in case you don't know where to get this
109:13 - data from you can simply google sample
109:14 - super store excel and that data site
109:17 - would be downloaded for you the reason
109:19 - why we are choosing this data set is
109:20 - because it is having a wide variety of
109:23 - data ranging from text to numbers
109:25 - location everything that one could ask
109:28 - for furthermore the data set is
109:30 - completely clean there are no
109:31 - inconsistencies so it would be easier
109:33 - for us to work on it
109:35 - and
109:36 - once you have downloaded the data set
109:37 - using the
109:39 - input tool you can simply just input the
109:41 - data then i have used two data cleansing
109:43 - tools
109:44 - which are in the preparation tab to
109:47 - clean the data
109:48 - now
109:49 - in case you're wondering what i have
109:51 - done over here i recommend you to just
109:52 - go through the previous videos where
109:54 - i've explained this process in a
109:55 - step-by-step fashion
109:57 - now once we have done with all this let
109:59 - us just go back to our append fields
110:01 - tool and bring it up over here
110:03 - as you can see the append fields tool
110:05 - has two anchors on the input that is t
110:08 - and s
110:10 - t stands for target and s stands for
110:12 - source and there is one output anchor so
110:15 - let us understand first of all what is
110:17 - this tool all about append fields tool
110:19 - is used to append the fields of one
110:21 - small input which is taken as a source
110:24 - denoted by the s over here to every
110:26 - record of another larger input that is
110:28 - the target
110:30 - the result is a cartesian join now in a
110:33 - cartesian join every row from one table
110:35 - is joined to every row of the other
110:37 - table like if there are two tables uh
110:40 - table one has like hundred rows and
110:41 - table two has thousand rows so the
110:43 - cartesian join would be 100 into
110:45 - thousand that is a hundred thousand rows
110:47 - in total
110:49 - so this is what happens in the cartesian
110:50 - join and in case you want to perform a
110:53 - cartesian join on your tables then you
110:55 - can use this append fields option okay
110:57 - the append field tool accepts two inputs
110:59 - which is again a target and a source the
111:02 - target is a larger data stream and the
111:03 - source is a smaller data stream that
111:06 - provides the records that are added to
111:08 - the target stream okay
111:10 - now in order to configure the tool here
111:12 - we can see the configuration panel over
111:14 - here
111:15 - we can use this table to modify the
111:16 - incoming data stream
111:18 - uh here each row is representing an
111:21 - individual column in the table as you
111:23 - can see row id order id order date ship
111:25 - date shipment etc
111:27 - now here what are the options what are
111:29 - the things that we can do is
111:32 - we can modify the type of the column
111:34 - like right now it's double but if you
111:37 - want to change it to anything else you
111:38 - can change it like i want int 16 over
111:40 - here so that its size also decreases if
111:43 - in the case of the strings you want to
111:44 - change the size you can do that as well
111:47 - if you want to rename a column that also
111:49 - you can do like instead of the row id i
111:51 - want s number to be present over here
111:53 - serial number okay
111:55 - so sno is what i want to
111:58 - rename it
111:59 - in case you want to provide a
112:00 - description for your columns that you
112:02 - can also provide
112:05 - now what would happen is once the
112:07 - correlation join is performed this is
112:08 - how the columns would be treated like
112:10 - with the description with the renamed
112:11 - value and with the modified type over
112:13 - here okay
112:14 - now uh this is a one thing that you can
112:17 - do now in case you want to select
112:18 - multiple fields like this
112:20 - then there is this options button that
112:22 - is present there are a bunch of options
112:24 - that you can use like save or load
112:26 - that means you can save the field
112:28 - configuration as a dot y x f t file
112:32 - uh which is ultrix field type file um
112:35 - that can be used in other workflows
112:37 - as well
112:39 - then we can use the select option to
112:41 - either select all of the columns or
112:43 - deselect them all
112:44 - we can change the field type of the
112:46 - highlighted fields this is only
112:48 - available if all the fields that you
112:50 - have highlighted are the same type so
112:52 - you can just change them to
112:54 - a common or a mutual type right
112:57 - next we have is the sort option which is
112:59 - of course used to sort the columns
113:02 - in assigning all the descending orders
113:03 - like uh sort on the original field name
113:06 - on a new field name on the field type or
113:08 - revert to the incoming field auto next
113:11 - we have is the move option that is used
113:13 - to move the highlighted columns to the
113:14 - top or the bottom of the list if you
113:16 - want to perform this option
113:19 - if you want to add some prefix to the
113:21 - field names if you want to add suffix to
113:22 - the field names if you want to remove
113:24 - any prefix remove any suffix or if you
113:26 - want to uh clear all the renames that
113:29 - you have done so far that you can do
113:32 - using this uh if you want uh the
113:34 - highlighted fields only whose renames
113:36 - you want to clear that also you can do
113:38 - reward all the original type and size
113:40 - that means all of the changes that you
113:41 - have done would be
113:43 - unchanged
113:44 - and
113:46 - so on these are all the options that we
113:48 - have available next we have is
113:52 - this option one slash error on too many
113:55 - records being generated so
113:57 - uh in this append fields tool it
113:59 - performs a cartesian join which means
114:01 - the number of the rows of both of these
114:04 - tables are actually multiplied with one
114:06 - another that means a huge number of rows
114:08 - would be generated right
114:09 - so
114:10 - it is a possibility that unintentionally
114:13 - you can produce so many errors
114:16 - so you can configure the warnings or
114:18 - errors to be reported so that not too
114:21 - many records are being produced
114:23 - now for this we have three options allow
114:25 - all appends that means all records
114:27 - should be appended to all the records
114:29 - with no error or warning
114:31 - next is one appends of more than three
114:33 - 16 records
114:35 - like if there are more than 16 records
114:37 - in the source file
114:38 - a warning is reported and the workflow
114:40 - continues processing
114:42 - third option is error on appends of more
114:45 - than 16 records so if there are more
114:47 - than 16 records in the source file
114:49 - then the error is reported and the
114:51 - workflow stops it processing so it is
114:54 - just to save the memory and provide a
114:57 - fail safe in case of the errors right so
115:00 - i'm going to go with all allow all
115:02 - appends just for this case to show you
115:04 - how this tool is gonna work okay
115:08 - so here i have actually um
115:11 - run the append fields tool let me
115:13 - explain to you quickly that what i have
115:14 - done
115:15 - uh the target we have already taken
115:20 - in the case of source what we have done
115:22 - is we have taken a few records around
115:25 - 5000 records for the source now where
115:27 - these records come from
115:29 - from the target itself we created three
115:32 - separate excel sheets on the basis of
115:34 - segment so if you just go to this
115:36 - particular data here you will find that
115:39 - there is this field called segment it
115:41 - has three possible values consumer home
115:44 - office and corporate
115:47 - these are the three segments okay so uh
115:50 - these three excel sheets were created in
115:52 - one excel sheet all the consumer related
115:54 - records were there in another there were
115:56 - all corporate related records and so on
115:59 - so just like that i have taken one more
116:01 - excel sheet which contains all the
116:03 - consumer records now this would act as
116:05 - my source because source is usually
116:07 - smaller in size than the target
116:09 - so a total of
116:11 - 5191 records were in this and a total of
116:14 - 9994 records were in this as you can see
116:17 - over here the number of the records is
116:19 - shown
116:20 - so what i have done is uh i have used
116:23 - these two things in the append tool and
116:26 - run this
116:27 - after running it i applied a browse tool
116:30 - the browse tool is nothing but it helps
116:33 - us to you know
116:35 - see that what is going on inside the
116:37 - tool if you just uh click over this
116:40 - append fields tool then you will see
116:41 - that this is the targets field
116:44 - it is same the changes that we did here
116:46 - that was renaming the serial name number
116:48 - row id to serial number is not been
116:50 - reflected over here and in the source we
116:52 - have the row id again with all the
116:54 - records present over here
116:56 - but as soon as we added the browse tool
116:59 - and click on run then it is going to
117:01 - show me the updated records like how
117:04 - many records were taken from there so a
117:06 - 5191 records from the consumer that
117:09 - means the source and 9994 records from
117:12 - the orders sheet that is the actual data
117:14 - set now it's going to take a few seconds
117:16 - and here you can see the percentage of
117:19 - the process that has been completed
117:22 - uh and
117:23 - along with this you can see the memory
117:24 - that it is being occupied right now it's
117:26 - 4.9 gb so let's just give it a few
117:29 - seconds
117:30 - and uh see what happens when it's fully
117:32 - run so let us make after it's completed
117:35 - fully after it's fully executed
117:39 - now uh the whole process has run
117:42 - and you can see uh due to the browse
117:45 - tool we are able to see
117:47 - that uh the first row that was row id
117:50 - initially has been changed to serial
117:52 - number
117:53 - and now we are getting uh
117:56 - the combination of the records that is
117:58 - um
117:59 - target
118:00 - the number of rows of the target
118:02 - multiplied by the number of rows of the
118:03 - source so this is the total number of
118:06 - records that we are getting and this is
118:07 - the size that is 7.9 gb so this is how
118:10 - the append fields tool or the cartesian
118:12 - join works in altrics that's all for
118:14 - this video thanks for watching
118:17 - hello everyone welcome back to the
118:19 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
118:21 - going to talk about
118:23 - very important tools that are present in
118:25 - the join tab of the altrex tool now
118:28 - these tools are the find and the replace
118:30 - tool as the name suggests they help you
118:32 - to find for the values and if you want
118:34 - to replace your found value with any
118:36 - other value
118:37 - so for that also this tool is used okay
118:40 - so here in the workflow as you can
118:42 - already see i have input the data that
118:44 - is the sample superstore data
118:46 - and i have applied two data cleansing
118:48 - operations
118:49 - so this i have already explained in the
118:51 - previous videos in case you have not
118:53 - seen the videos i would recommend you to
118:54 - go and watch them to easily understand
118:56 - that what's going on here
118:57 - now once your data is clean let us make
119:00 - use of the fine and replace tool it is
119:02 - present in the joined app so here is the
119:03 - join nav and here is the finance replace
119:05 - tool let me just drag it over here
119:07 - now uh let us understand this tool it is
119:10 - used to find a string in one column of a
119:12 - data set and look up and replace it with
119:14 - the specified value from another data
119:16 - set right
119:18 - so you can use it to append columns uh
119:20 - as well
119:22 - uh
119:23 - now
119:24 - if we take a look at the configuration
119:26 - tab we have this find section and the
119:28 - replay section there are two different
119:30 - sections right in the find section we
119:32 - have these three radio buttons that can
119:34 - be chosen as per our wish
119:37 - first is beginning of field that
119:38 - searches for the instance of the field
119:40 - value at the beginning of the field
119:42 - the entire field does not have to
119:44 - contain what is being searched for
119:46 - next we have any part of the field which
119:49 - means it would search for the instance
119:50 - of the field value in any part of the
119:52 - field the entire field again does not
119:55 - have to be containing what is being
119:57 - searched for
119:58 - third is the entire field that it would
120:00 - search for the instance of the field
120:02 - value contained within the entire field
120:05 - the instance must be there in its
120:07 - entirety to be replaced with a new value
120:10 - then we have find within field option
120:13 - which is used to select the field in the
120:15 - table with the data to be replaced
120:18 - f is the input anchor
120:20 - by the data in the reference table and r
120:22 - is the input anchor
120:25 - uh that is being specified by which data
120:27 - to be replaced
120:28 - okay next we have is the find value that
120:31 - is um used to select the field from the
120:33 - reference table that is the r
120:35 - that contains the same values as the
120:37 - find within table in the original table
120:40 - okay
120:41 - next we have the case and sensor define
120:43 - and match the whole world only so
120:46 - what we will do is if we take a look at
120:49 - this orders table this we would be
120:51 - connecting to the replace okay next we
120:54 - would be getting another in out and let
120:56 - me just get the input data
120:59 - here what i have done is let me just
121:01 - move it a little bit here
121:04 - so what i have done uh is i have made
121:06 - some changes into the subcategory field
121:08 - and the category fields okay
121:10 - so what i'm gonna do is just
121:13 - first of all get the file over here
121:17 - and this is the file that i want
121:25 - yeah
121:26 - so here let's just click on ok
121:32 - and connect it to the find values okay
121:35 - so it is going to
121:36 - find the values and replace it okay
121:40 - so let me just go back to this tool
121:43 - if i just click on the output anchor of
121:45 - this first field what we would be
121:48 - getting here
121:51 - is 100 records actually
121:54 - and here you can see the uh sub category
121:57 - chairs is having a different spelling
122:00 - means there are some of the white spaces
122:01 - but in the case of this the output angle
122:04 - of the data cleansed field
122:06 - we'll find that in the subcategory
122:09 - the chairs are correct okay so we need
122:11 - to find the value of choose and replace
122:13 - it with this that means the subcategory
122:15 - field would be employed so let's just
122:17 - click on this uh entire field
122:20 - sub category and replace it with a
122:23 - subcategory value okay
122:25 - and
122:26 - that's the case in sensitive fine or
122:28 - let's just keep all the settings as this
122:30 - only and click on run
122:33 - now you can see that
122:36 - we have find
122:38 - in this f targets there are a number of
122:40 - records and in the r target that's the
122:41 - source there are a number of records
122:44 - if we click on the output anchor so the
122:46 - total number of records is 5191 that
122:49 - means the field where we have replaced
122:51 - the values right
122:53 - and the values would have been replaced
122:55 - over here
122:58 - okay so here we can just select the
123:00 - subcategory again
123:03 - and click on run
123:13 - so this is how the find and the replace
123:15 - tool works it is used to replace the
123:17 - values right
123:19 - so this was all about the find section
123:21 - let us now focus on the replace section
123:23 - so we have replace found text with value
123:26 - that means we have to choose the field
123:28 - from the reference table
123:30 - to update the original table that means
123:31 - the fine table
123:33 - uh if you want to replace multiple items
123:36 - then you can just check this
123:38 - button or you can just uncheck it
123:41 - append fields to record if you want to
123:43 - append a column
123:46 - from the find field to the replace field
123:48 - then you can just do that as well okay
123:50 - so these are the options uh that are
123:52 - available let me just append some
123:54 - records category and the product name
123:56 - records
123:57 - and click on run
124:00 - now if you just click on this
124:04 - output anchor
124:09 - then you can see category 2 and product
124:11 - name 2 are also available over here that
124:13 - means these have been appended in the
124:15 - final
124:16 - output so that's how the find and the
124:17 - replace tool works
124:19 - now let us talk about the other tool
124:21 - that is available
124:23 - which is known as the union tool so the
124:26 - union tool is a special tool which is
124:28 - again present in the join tab
124:30 - now what is the function of this tool it
124:33 - is used to combine two or more data sets
124:35 - on the column names or the position so
124:37 - on the basis of the column names or the
124:39 - position
124:40 - it is used to combine the data sets
124:42 - right and in the output each column
124:44 - contains the row from each input
124:47 - we can
124:48 - actually perform the union operation on
124:50 - the basis of the number of the columns
124:52 - or the position the name of the columns
124:54 - or the position of the columns right so
124:56 - if we take a look at this
124:58 - we have two uh columns we have two data
125:01 - sets right now that is the consumer
125:03 - segment data set and the corporate
125:05 - segment data set so if we just take a
125:07 - look at these data sets they all have
125:08 - the same
125:10 - values that is the same columns column
125:12 - names are same and the position is also
125:14 - same rate so we can just perform the
125:16 - union on both cases that is on the basis
125:19 - of name and on the
125:20 - basis of positions as well right
125:23 - so what we are going to do is uh we are
125:26 - just going to take both of them
125:28 - drag this union tool over here
125:30 - and we are going to connect them so this
125:32 - is one
125:35 - and this is two so we can just uh
125:38 - attach them both of them the one is the
125:41 - consumer and the second is the corporate
125:43 - now if we just check on this output tab
125:46 - what we would be getting
125:48 - is a combination of the rows that is
125:50 - 8211 records in total
125:53 - here you can see
125:55 - right uh then we have this
125:58 - for
125:59 - cross check we have the segment column
126:01 - where first of all the consumer values
126:03 - are there
126:04 - and then if you just scroll down
126:10 - we would be having the corporate values
126:12 - okay
126:14 - so this is what we are getting over here
126:16 - um
126:18 - now if you just go to this union tool
126:20 - here we have three options auto config
126:22 - by name that means if the column names
126:24 - is similar then you can use this option
126:27 - next is auto config by position that
126:29 - means if the position is similar then
126:31 - automatic configuration would be done on
126:32 - the basis of position so we can do that
126:34 - as well because uh in our case both of
126:36 - these things are same so there would be
126:38 - no change
126:40 - right but the third option that we have
126:42 - right now is the manual configuration by
126:44 - the fields so if you want to configure
126:46 - some fields to other values that you can
126:48 - do like
126:49 - here we have state and postal code so if
126:52 - you want to just
126:53 - change them
126:55 - with this interchange them like this
126:57 - okay
126:58 - and click on run
127:01 - so now what would happen is if you just
127:03 - go there
127:06 - in the state and the postal code these
127:08 - values would be interchanged with one
127:10 - another right
127:11 - to understand it in a better way we can
127:13 - just use the browse tool over here
127:16 - so that we can get to see the individual
127:18 - records and run it
127:23 - right
127:24 - now if we just go to this tool
127:28 - here
127:30 - we can find the postal code
127:36 - right
127:37 - and as you can see the longest value is
127:39 - not carolina uh the last alpha numeric
127:42 - value is winsconsin that means the
127:45 - values have been interchanged okay
127:48 - and similarly in order to check for the
127:50 - segment
127:51 - what we can do is just select the
127:53 - segment one
127:55 - segment field over here
127:57 - here is the segment field and there are
127:58 - two values the consumer segment and the
128:00 - corporate segment so that is how the
128:01 - union works for the union to work at
128:04 - least to the of the data sets must be
128:06 - available and they must have some of the
128:08 - common ground on the basis of which you
128:11 - can perform the union operation union
128:13 - operation is similar that is one table
128:17 - is appended over the other table no
128:19 - changes are made into the individual
128:21 - records only
128:24 - the
128:25 - appending operation takes place so
128:27 - that's all for this union tool and
128:29 - that's all for this video in the next
128:31 - videos we would be looking at some more
128:33 - tools of this joint app that's all for
128:35 - this video thanks for watching
128:38 - hello everyone welcome to ultrix
128:40 - tutorials in this video we are going to
128:42 - take a look at the join tool in ultrix
128:45 - so the join tool is a part of the join
128:47 - tab group and it is a very useful tool
128:50 - in ultrix we would be seeing all about
128:52 - this tool in this video
128:54 - so first of all let us understand that
128:56 - what is the basic functions of this tool
128:58 - uh join rule is used to combine the two
129:01 - inputs based on some common fields
129:03 - between the two tables
129:05 - we can also join two data streams based
129:08 - upon the record position of those
129:10 - streams
129:11 - so for the join tool we have two inputs
129:13 - over here
129:14 - as you can see input data one
129:17 - we just click on it
129:18 - it would open the excel file
129:21 - so it has a few fields
129:24 - here and it is the segment field is the
129:27 - consumer segment as you can see all the
129:29 - segments are consumer over here in this
129:31 - field okay
129:32 - and the second we have is the same table
129:36 - but the number of records is different
129:38 - and the segment here is the corporate
129:40 - segment over here like this so here are
129:43 - the two sheets the consumer sheet and
129:44 - the corporate sheet which are actually a
129:46 - part
129:47 - um and taken as two different inputs to
129:49 - be joined together right that means we
129:52 - have two inputs with common fields
129:55 - between them which we need to join
129:57 - now let us drag this join tool over here
129:59 - as you can see
130:01 - this is a join tool
130:04 - and
130:05 - in order to perform the join
130:08 - we can
130:11 - actually use two options which are
130:13 - available in this configuration tab that
130:15 - is joined by record position or joined
130:16 - by specific fields
130:18 - now if we talk about join by record
130:19 - position this option is used when two
130:22 - tables have the same field structure and
130:25 - the data will be joined by its position
130:27 - within the two tables
130:29 - next we have is joined by specific
130:30 - fields
130:32 - it is used when the two tables have one
130:34 - or more fields in common and the data
130:36 - will be joined together on the basis of
130:38 - the common field only
130:40 - and we can choose to join based upon the
130:43 - multiple fields and each join should be
130:45 - a separate row in the grid like this is
130:47 - the grid so each join each criteria that
130:49 - you are giving for the join should be
130:51 - for a separate row in this table but i'm
130:53 - just going to go with the join with
130:54 - record position joined by record
130:56 - position first of all let me just drag
130:58 - this one to l and the other to r so l
131:02 - means left and r means right these are
131:04 - the two anchors that we are getting
131:07 - now each input l and r or left and right
131:10 - has a drop down list
131:13 - from where we can just actually select
131:15 - the fields uh or the join field for each
131:17 - of the inputs
131:19 - altered
131:20 - designer will automatically select the
131:21 - field for us as in this case you can see
131:23 - it has selected the row id field for us
131:26 - to be taken as the drop down uh as the
131:28 - joining field okay
131:31 - now we can just use this table to modify
131:33 - the data that means it's type we can
131:36 - modify like right now it's double we can
131:38 - just select it to in 16 to reduce its
131:40 - size a little bit
131:42 - we can rename it so let's just rename it
131:44 - to a serial number just to show you that
131:47 - how the changes are going to work and
131:49 - like this we can just modify it like the
131:51 - data type the size we can rename it or
131:53 - add a description so
131:55 - let's just add a description that is
131:57 - serial
131:58 - number
132:00 - like this okay
132:03 - so these are the changes that i have
132:04 - done
132:07 - all right and then there is this unknown
132:08 - column which is basically used
132:11 - in case we want to add more columns
132:15 - now uh in case of the view output there
132:17 - are these three options that is the l
132:19 - anchor that contains the records from
132:20 - the l input that didn't join to the
132:22 - records from the r input the j anchor
132:25 - that contains the records that join from
132:27 - the l and the r input and then we have
132:29 - the r anchor
132:32 - uh that contains the records uh from the
132:34 - r input that didn't join into the
132:35 - records from the l input so this is the
132:38 - um
132:38 - order and these are the three anchors
132:41 - that have been shown over here if we
132:42 - just click on run
132:45 - so the joining would occur let's just
132:47 - click on the l anchor to get
132:49 - the uh record from the l input that
132:51 - didn't join to the record from the r
132:53 - input so a total of 2171 records are
132:55 - there
132:56 - we click on j so 3020 records are j uh
133:00 - in this j anchor that means the records
133:02 - that have been joined from the l input
133:04 - to the r input
133:07 - over here as you can see
133:10 - there are 3020 records and in this r
133:12 - anchor we have no records that means
133:14 - there are no records in the r input that
133:17 - didn't join to the records of the l
133:18 - input so this is how the join tool works
133:23 - and uh
133:25 - there are these different types of joins
133:27 - that can
133:28 - happen uh in this
133:31 - using the join tool first is the inner
133:33 - join that we have done right now
133:36 - specified by this j anchor this is the
133:38 - inner join that contains the records
133:40 - that join from the l input to the
133:42 - records in the r input
133:44 - uh this l anchor refers to the
133:47 - left unjoined that contains only of the
133:49 - records that didn't join to those of the
133:52 - r and this r contains of the are
133:55 - unjoined
133:56 - records uh next we have is a possibility
134:00 - of a left outer join that all the
134:02 - records from the l input including the
134:03 - records that join with the r input
134:06 - right
134:08 - uh now this can be achieved with the
134:09 - help of two tools the join tool and the
134:11 - union tool
134:12 - um
134:14 - so what we can do is actually
134:18 - get a union tool
134:21 - here and if we just combine them
134:23 - together that means
134:25 - connect the j and l
134:28 - outputs of the join tool to the union
134:29 - tool so the l is connected let's just
134:31 - connect the j as well
134:33 - now if we just click on this output
134:36 - button
134:40 - and um
134:41 - just
134:42 - run it then what we would be getting is
134:44 - a total of 5191 records which is the
134:49 - result of the left outer join similarly
134:51 - if you want to get a result of the right
134:53 - outer join now what is right outer join
134:56 - uh that means all the records from the r
134:58 - input including the records that are
135:00 - joined
135:01 - with the l inputs again let's just get a
135:03 - union
135:04 - uh let's just drag the j
135:06 - and the r anchors over here
135:10 - and run the workflow
135:14 - so here it is let's just click on the
135:16 - output and this is around 3020 records
135:19 - that are a part of the right output join
135:21 - last but not the least we have the full
135:23 - outer join
135:24 - so that means all the records that are
135:27 - a part of the l and the r inputs are
135:30 - the full outer join
135:33 - uh full outer join is actually similar
135:35 - to
135:37 - uh the append fields join which means it
135:40 - actually performs a cartesian join a
135:42 - combination of all the records of both
135:44 - the tables would be shown over here and
135:46 - the total number of rows would be the
135:48 - product of the individual rows in the uh
135:52 - tables so either we can directly use the
135:54 - pain fields or if you don't want to use
135:55 - the print fields then you can actually
135:58 - use a third option so what i'm gonna do
136:01 - is just copy these three tools
136:04 - right click copy and create a new
136:06 - workflow out of them so as to avoid the
136:08 - confusion
136:09 - and here i am going to perform the
136:11 - full outer join so let's just get the
136:13 - union tool over here
136:16 - we need to connect all these three that
136:17 - is l j and r over here so first of all
136:20 - we need to connect the j
136:22 - output or the j anchor why we are doing
136:25 - it every time we are using the union
136:27 - tool after the join rule make sure you
136:29 - first connect the shape
136:30 - to establish the combined table schema
136:33 - that what is going to be the final table
136:35 - schema right
136:36 - then you can connect l
136:38 - and then you can connect r
136:42 - and then run this workflow
136:44 - so after a few seconds
136:46 - here is the output
136:48 - total of 5191 records would be displayed
136:51 - over here
136:53 - with all the values right and if you
136:56 - want to cross check your results what
136:57 - you can do is actually use the pen
136:59 - fields option
137:00 - so for this we are just going to copy
137:02 - these two tools
137:04 - you can select multiple by control
137:06 - clicking them right click copy
137:08 - go to the new workflow and paste them
137:11 - either using the shortcut ctrl v or
137:13 - simply just right click and paste right
137:16 - let me move it here get the append
137:18 - fields tool
137:20 - over here get it here
137:22 - and get it here
137:25 - run it
137:35 - allow all the pens and click on run
137:39 - it's going to take a few seconds of
137:41 - course apparent fields is a little bit
137:43 - slower option
137:45 - than the
137:46 - um
137:48 - union and the join tool combined so
137:50 - let's just wait for a few seconds
137:53 - and while you're waiting you can see
137:55 - actually the progress
137:56 - with which it is working on okay
138:00 - right so now if we just click on this
138:02 - output anchor
138:04 - then we would be seeing a total of all
138:06 - the records that are present over here
138:08 - so that is how the joints work uh the
138:11 - cartesian joint or the
138:13 - full outer join the left outer join the
138:15 - right outer join and basically all the
138:17 - types of the joints with the help of the
138:18 - join tool union tool and the apparent
138:20 - fills tool that is all that we would be
138:23 - looking at in this join tab and that's
138:26 - all for this video thanks for watching
138:31 - hello everyone welcome to alteryx videos
138:34 - in this video we are going to talk about
138:36 - a tool that is known as the regex tool
138:39 - in ultrix
138:40 - so rejects is basically stands for
138:42 - regular expressions and that helps us to
138:46 - find for particular values in the
138:49 - uh table okay
138:52 - so here is a few uh small setup that i
138:54 - have done for the rejects tool this is
138:56 - how a regex tool looks and it is a part
138:59 - of the parse tab
139:01 - in the ultrix so here is the rejects
139:04 - tool that's present it is used to
139:07 - leverage the regular expression syntax
139:09 - to pass match or replace the data
139:12 - so for the regex tool first of all the
139:14 - data must be present so i have taken a
139:16 - data that is the consumer statement data
139:18 - from the output excel sheets that we
139:20 - have already prepared in the previous
139:21 - videos
139:22 - in case you have not watched the videos
139:24 - i would recommend you to watch them to
139:25 - better understand what we are doing over
139:27 - here
139:28 - so once i have taken the data from the
139:31 - input data tool then
139:32 - let me just delete it once
139:34 - the next thing is to go to this parts
139:36 - tab and grab this regex tool over here
139:39 - okay
139:39 - now what we are going to do is connect
139:41 - these anchors like this
139:44 - and in the regex tools configuration we
139:47 - have the first option
139:49 - that is the configure the
139:51 - column to parse so here you can just
139:54 - select the column which we want to parse
139:56 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm just going
139:58 - to go with the customer name column that
139:59 - i want to parse
140:01 - next is in format to convert option we
140:05 - have to add the regular expression so
140:09 - here is the pearl five rejects syntax
140:11 - that has been followed
140:13 - by these regular expressions in case you
140:15 - do not know about the regular
140:17 - expressions and want to read about it
140:19 - then how can you go with it you can
140:21 - simply just go to google
140:24 - and here you can just search for
140:26 - regex
140:29 - altricks rejects two lal tricks are
140:31 - basically regexal tricks
140:33 - so if you just search for it you would
140:35 - get the first link that is
140:36 - help.alteryx.com
140:38 - that would give you the official altrix
140:41 - documentation for this tool and in this
140:43 - official documentation you will find
140:45 - this link that is perl regular
140:47 - expression syntax you can just click on
140:49 - this link and here is all the
140:51 - information that you need to know about
140:53 - the regular expressions before working
140:55 - on them like everything that um every
140:58 - syntax of regex that is being used
141:01 - is uh shown over here okay
141:04 - so you can take your time and uh read it
141:06 - understand it well and then come back to
141:08 - this video so
141:10 - let me just quickly show you that how
141:13 - these regular expressions are going to
141:14 - work
141:15 - here what we have is the plus sign which
141:18 - is the button that is used to access the
141:20 - common regular expressions that we may
141:22 - need by creating the expression
141:25 - so if you just click on this plus icon
141:27 - we would be uh seeing these operations
141:29 - like if you want to match for a single
141:30 - character you want to
141:33 - match for zero or more characters or one
141:35 - or more characters you want to measure
141:36 - the start of the word end of the word
141:38 - beginning with the line and the line
141:40 - and so on these are all the regular
141:42 - expressions and tags that have been
141:43 - given to you
141:44 - next is the case insensitive option
141:49 - just a second here is this case in
141:50 - sensitive option which is checked by
141:52 - default that means
141:55 - the
141:56 - searches that would be happening through
141:58 - regular expression would not distinguish
142:00 - between the upper case and the lowercase
142:02 - letters right
142:04 - next we have is the output where we have
142:06 - the output method which is used
142:08 - when parsing
142:10 - to configure the related properties like
142:12 - what you want to do once the expressions
142:14 - have been matched so we have four
142:16 - methods that are available the first one
142:18 - is replace so it means that we want to
142:21 - replace the expression
142:23 - that we have searched with a second
142:26 - expression now where you want to find
142:28 - the second expression that is in the
142:30 - replacement text you can enter the
142:32 - replacement text
142:34 - uh that we want
142:35 - the original expression to be replaced
142:37 - with again we have this
142:39 - plus that would uh allow you to
142:42 - actually
142:43 - uh find the entire text or just the
142:45 - particular character
142:47 - to be replaced okay the common regular
142:49 - expressions again that are needed
142:52 - and then we have the copy unmatched
142:54 - text to output if you want to copy it to
142:57 - the output as well that also you can do
142:59 - otherwise you can just remove it
143:01 - next option that we have in this output
143:02 - is the tokenize method that is used to
143:05 - split the incoming data using a regular
143:07 - expression
143:08 - uh it works
143:10 - in similar to the next tool that we have
143:12 - is the text to columns tool so we would
143:14 - be working more with the text to columns
143:16 - tool so i'm not going to explain
143:18 - everything over here
143:20 - and
143:22 - it has um
143:23 - some options like
143:25 - if you just select it tokenize method
143:28 - then you can see we have different
143:29 - options like a split to columns option
143:32 - like you want to split a single column
143:34 - of data at each instance to the
143:36 - specified delimiter into the multiple
143:38 - columns
143:39 - and what would be the extra behavior or
143:42 - the behavior of the extra columns like
143:43 - you want to drop them with the warning
143:45 - you want to drop them without warning or
143:47 - you want to show an error before
143:48 - dropping the columns
143:50 - then there is this output root name
143:53 - which is actually the original name of
143:55 - the column
143:57 - that we are going to use
143:58 - and if you want to split a single column
144:01 - of data at each instance of the
144:02 - specified delimiter into multiple rows
144:05 - then this option needs to be checked
144:08 - third method we have is the parse method
144:11 - it is used to separate the expression
144:13 - into new columns and set the name type
144:15 - size and expression for the new columns
144:18 - a new column is created in the output
144:21 - columns table with the its name its
144:24 - particular data type its size and the
144:26 - expression which is automatically
144:27 - populated so you can just specify name
144:30 - type and size
144:32 - last but not the least we have is the
144:34 - match
144:35 - option that is used to append a column
144:38 - containing a number
144:39 - that is one if the expression is matched
144:41 - and 0 if it did not matched
144:44 - now um
144:45 - column id column name for match status
144:47 - that means a new column would be created
144:49 - so what would be the name of the column
144:51 - that you can specify over here by
144:52 - default it is taken as order id
144:54 - underscore matched right um
144:57 - and there is this option of error if not
144:59 - match so if the expression is not
145:01 - matched and you want to generate some
145:03 - kind of an error that it would generate
145:06 - by checking on this option or by
145:07 - unchecking it okay
145:09 - so let's just see uh the practical
145:11 - application of this regular expression
145:13 - but before that let me just get a look
145:14 - of how the data is looking
145:17 - so here it is we are using the customer
145:19 - name
145:22 - in the customer name field we have um
145:25 - different customer names
145:27 - starting with different letters right so
145:29 - let's just go to the regular expression
145:31 - field
145:32 - and i wanted to start with
145:35 - any single character should be z
145:38 - okay
145:39 - and uh i just want a match column to be
145:42 - there that
145:43 - there should be a column
145:45 - that should be name underscore matched
145:50 - that if it is matched it should show me
145:53 - one otherwise it should show me a zero
145:56 - and click on run
145:58 - now wait for a few seconds till it's
145:59 - been run
146:03 - here now we can see that we are getting
146:05 - this name matched option where the
146:07 - results are false there should be some
146:08 - true results in order to get that what
146:10 - we are going to do is grab the browse
146:12 - tool over here
146:14 - and in this browse tool
146:17 - let's just run it once again run the
146:19 - workflow
146:21 - now in the browse tool uh we are going
146:24 - to go with the last record that is the
146:26 - name matched record so all our faults
146:28 - that means uh there were no records that
146:31 - had z in them right so let me just
146:35 - append my query just modify my query a
146:37 - little bit
146:38 - and here get a instead of set
146:41 - run it
146:44 - so here what we have done is added a and
146:47 - in this case uh check the option of
146:49 - error if not matched so if there is no
146:51 - matching in the first record itself then
146:53 - the error would be there so let me just
146:55 - turn on it
146:57 - so this is what we are getting as the
146:59 - error because the first letter was not a
147:02 - that is why it didn't match the
147:04 - expression and the error was there and
147:06 - it has finished its running in just 1.4
147:08 - seconds okay
147:11 - so this is how the regular expressions
147:13 - work now let us move on to the next tool
147:16 - that we have and that is the
147:19 - text to columns tool so let me just
147:21 - create a new workflow and in this
147:23 - workflow what i'm going to do is just
147:25 - copy paste this
147:26 - input data okay so let's just copy it
147:31 - and paste it
147:35 - and grab this text to columns tool
147:39 - over here
147:40 - so it would give me the um
147:44 - freedom to just you know
147:46 - uh
147:46 - split the columns like we have the order
147:48 - id column in which hyphen can act as a
147:50 - delimiter so i want to split this column
147:52 - so let's just go to this
147:54 - um tool
147:56 - select order id column the delimiter
147:58 - specified needs to be hyphen the number
148:00 - of columns that needs to be created is
148:02 - three
148:03 - and uh leave if there are any extra
148:05 - columns then leave it in the last column
148:07 - and output root name is going to be
148:09 - order id right let's just click on run
148:14 - and now what we can see is a total of 24
148:17 - fields
148:19 - so
148:21 - here what we are getting order id 1
148:23 - order id 2 and order id id3 since there
148:25 - were only three things so three have
148:27 - been shown over here in case there were
148:29 - multiple uh hyphens like let me just
148:34 - decrease the number of columns to two
148:36 - and click on run then what would happen
148:38 - is we would be getting order id 1 and in
148:42 - the last column the combination of both
148:44 - of them like order id 2 and 3 with a
148:46 - hyphen is present over here if you want
148:48 - to rename the column you can just rename
148:50 - it simply
148:53 - uh using the tools that we have seen in
148:54 - the past so um any kind of a renaming
148:57 - that you want to perform that you can do
148:59 - so that's all for this video in which we
149:01 - looked about the rejects tool and the
149:03 - takes two columns tool
149:04 - uh in the parse tab of the altrix that's
149:07 - all for this video thanks for watching
149:10 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
149:12 - tutorials in this video we are going to
149:15 - talk about a very important tool in
149:17 - ultrix known as the count records tool
149:20 - so count record tool is present in the
149:23 - transform tab
149:25 - in the ultrix it is used to return the
149:27 - count of the number of the records that
149:30 - are passing through the tool
149:32 - now
149:32 - we can use this tool when we want to
149:35 - report on the resulting record
149:37 - uh or the record count
149:39 - that is being used in the workflow
149:42 - um it even returns account of a 0 as
149:45 - well
149:46 - so in case you are wondering that how
149:48 - would you get the total number of
149:50 - records then you can do that with the
149:52 - help of the count records tool
149:54 - now you can get that on the entire
149:56 - database or you can apply some filters
150:00 - and get the records that match that
150:02 - particular filter as well
150:04 - so i'm going to show you the example for
150:06 - both
150:08 - let me first get the input data tool and
150:10 - get my data that is stored in this
150:12 - output excel file the consumer sheet
150:15 - now if i just run it right now
150:19 - i would be getting all the records that
150:20 - are present in there that is a total of
150:22 - 5191 records okay
150:25 - now the thing is i'm going to uh go to
150:27 - this output and apply a filter
150:30 - over here right so let's just use this
150:33 - filter tool
150:35 - here and the filter is going to be
150:38 - a basic filter that is i want to select
150:40 - the segment where the segment value is
150:42 - let's just get a value for the segment
150:45 - or let's just get a value for
150:48 - say category that is equal to technology
150:52 - so let me just apply the filter that is
150:55 - for the category
150:56 - if it is equals
150:58 - to technology okay
151:02 - then run this
151:05 - and we would be getting in the true part
151:08 - we are getting 951 records and in the
151:10 - false part we are getting
151:12 - 4000 some records okay
151:14 - so if you just go to the true part
151:17 - and then go to the transform tab get
151:19 - this count records uh filter or this
151:21 - count records tool and apply it over
151:23 - here
151:25 - then we just go to its output part okay
151:27 - or basically we just run this tool
151:30 - then what we are getting is 951 as the
151:33 - total because it is only added to the
151:35 - true part
151:36 - if i also connect this false part to
151:38 - here then you can see it's um not able
151:41 - to connect because
151:42 - this account records tool only accept
151:45 - one input right so to get the number of
151:47 - the false records we add another account
151:49 - records tool and click on run
151:52 - so now for this second count records
151:54 - tool if you just click on its output
151:56 - part we are getting four two four zero
151:59 - that's the number of the records for the
152:00 - false and this is the number of the
152:02 - records 951 is the number of records for
152:04 - the true part
152:05 - in case we decide to remove this filter
152:08 - right let me just remove this filter
152:10 - over here
152:12 - and also delete one of the counter calls
152:13 - tool then what can i do is directly
152:15 - connect my database to this count
152:17 - records tool
152:19 - now if i just run it
152:22 - then what do we get is
152:23 - 5191 that is the total number of records
152:26 - in the actual database so that's how the
152:29 - count records tool works either through
152:31 - filter or without the filter okay
152:34 - next tool that we are going to see is
152:37 - the cross tab tool so let me just save
152:39 - this workflow and move on to our second
152:41 - tool that is the cross tab tool now what
152:44 - is it
152:44 - usage of this tool it is used to pivot
152:46 - the orientation of the data in a table
152:50 - what it does is it moves the vertical
152:52 - data fields onto a horizontal axis and
152:54 - summarizes the data whenever it is
152:56 - specified
152:57 - it is in reverse application of the
152:59 - transpose tool which of course we would
153:01 - be seeing as well
153:03 - so there is no limit on the number of
153:04 - the rows or the columns that can be
153:06 - passed through this crosstab tool okay
153:08 - so for this crosstab tool what i have
153:10 - done is i have taken another database or
153:12 - i have created another database let me
153:14 - just use that because it is fairly small
153:16 - so it would be easier to understand for
153:18 - us
153:18 - so this database is present in the form
153:21 - of
153:22 - a named range in excel it has two
153:24 - columns the number of hours and the
153:26 - score so the name of the range is the
153:28 - scores so let me just get that click on
153:30 - ok
153:31 - this is how it is looking it has around
153:33 - 10 records okay
153:35 - it gives us the number of the hours the
153:37 - student has 30 and the score that he has
153:39 - scored okay
153:40 - let's just go to the transform tab and
153:42 - get our crosstab tool over here
153:46 - now once we get there uh it would ask us
153:49 - that if we want to group the data by any
153:52 - of these values
153:53 - so it is all the available data values
153:56 - that are present in the data set
153:59 - if you want it to be a grouped with a
154:01 - specific value you can just select that
154:04 - next is um
154:06 - if you want to
154:08 - create a value
154:10 - or change the column headers so a new
154:12 - column would be created for each of the
154:14 - unique values in this particular
154:16 - um
154:17 - header so the number of hours then we
154:19 - have
154:20 - values for new columns so
154:23 - these values would be used to propagate
154:24 - the new columns that are created by the
154:26 - number of hours
154:28 - now if you want to aggregate it
154:30 - um then you can just aggregate it using
154:33 - these all options so what all options we
154:35 - have some average count
154:37 - uh percent row percent column total
154:40 - first and last
154:41 - so
154:42 - what we are going to do is just go with
154:44 - the total row and a total column
154:46 - and click on run
154:50 - now here um
154:53 - we just select on the output tab here
154:55 - this is the output that we are getting
154:57 - that is the total
155:00 - of the rows and the columns is 733
155:02 - if we just
155:03 - um
155:05 - now instead of getting this total row
155:07 - and the total column i am changing the
155:09 - method of aggregating values to sum and
155:12 - just deselect them both and click on run
155:15 - now what would be getting is the record
155:18 - and the
155:20 - sum of the scores
155:23 - over here
155:24 - so this is how it is looking so this is
155:27 - basically the usage of the cross tab
155:28 - tool in altrix
155:31 - now let us take a look at the tool that
155:33 - is very similar to the crosstab tool and
155:35 - it is known as the transpose tool so let
155:38 - me just save it
155:40 - and what is the transpose tool it is
155:42 - actually
155:46 - somewhat different from the crosstab
155:47 - tool it is used to
155:50 - pivot the orientation of the data table
155:53 - it is basically used to transform the
155:55 - data so what we can do is the horizontal
155:58 - data fields would be shown on the
155:59 - vertical axis
156:01 - it is the reverse application of the
156:03 - crosstab tool
156:05 - and it is useful for extracting the
156:07 - non-conforming data there is no limit
156:09 - again on the number of records of the
156:11 - fields that could be transformed
156:13 - so here is the input data part that is
156:16 - same with the um
156:18 - crosstab tool that we just saw that is
156:20 - the number of hours and the score
156:22 - now let's go to this transform tab and
156:25 - get this transpose tool so when we get
156:27 - this transpose tool these are the
156:29 - configuration panel options that we are
156:31 - getting first is the key columns
156:33 - so
156:34 - from here we can select the columns to
156:36 - pivot the table around
156:38 - this name remains on the horizontal axis
156:41 - with its value replicated vertically for
156:43 - each data field that is selected
156:46 - so let me just select them all
156:48 - next is the data columns now that means
156:51 - that we can select the columns to carry
156:53 - through the analysis so let's just keep
156:56 - number of hours over here and the score
156:57 - over here
156:59 - here we have an option of a dynamic or
157:01 - unknown column so if you want to go for
157:03 - a dynamic or
157:05 - unknown columns as well you can just
157:06 - keep it checked okay
157:09 - you can just go to this question mark to
157:11 - run about uh to read about it that is
157:13 - running a workflow can introduce the new
157:15 - columns that were unknown at the
157:17 - configuration time so if you want to
157:19 - include those new columns you can make
157:21 - sure that this option is checked that's
157:23 - for a
157:24 - further step towards security
157:27 - last but not least we have the missing
157:29 - columns option
157:30 - that means what action we want to take
157:33 - if some of the columns are missing we
157:34 - want to report an error and stop
157:36 - processing the result we just want to
157:38 - throw a warning and continue on with the
157:40 - results or we just want to completely
157:42 - ignore it right so let's just keep up on
157:45 - one and click on run
157:48 - now what happens is um
157:50 - if you just click on the output panel
157:52 - this is how it's looking the number of
157:54 - hours
157:57 - is same the name has been changed to
157:59 - score and its value is being shown like
158:01 - this so basically score has been
158:05 - transposed into a horizontal row instead
158:07 - of a vertical a vertical column
158:10 - so this is what the function of the
158:11 - transpose tool is and this is what it
158:14 - has done now if you want you can compare
158:16 - it with the crosstab tool the cross tab
158:19 - tool what it did was
158:21 - it transformed the horizontal rows into
158:24 - the vertical columns now we have these
158:26 - columns for all of these values right
158:29 - but what the transpose tool did was just
158:31 - opposite of the crosstab tool it took
158:34 - the name of the column or the header of
158:36 - the column that was score and created
158:39 - multiple rows out of it the value for
158:41 - each of that was uh written over here
158:44 - like the value value value like this
158:45 - okay
158:46 - now in this transpose tool if we just
158:48 - select all the key columns and click on
158:50 - run once again
158:52 - then what would happen
158:53 - uh then we would be getting like this no
158:56 - values because we have transposed both
158:58 - of these columns so no
159:00 - none of the values are remaining with us
159:02 - okay
159:04 - and let me just show you another
159:06 - possibility that is
159:08 - if i just decide to transform the number
159:11 - of hours instead of this course value so
159:13 - this is how it would be looking the
159:14 - number of hours would be taking up the
159:16 - horizontal rows and its values would be
159:19 - assigned like this with a value field so
159:21 - name and value it would be taken in the
159:23 - form of a pair
159:25 - so that's all for this video in which we
159:27 - learned about three tools of the
159:28 - transform tab
159:30 - and
159:30 - thanks for watching the video
159:33 - hello everyone welcome to altrix
159:36 - tutorials in this video we are going to
159:38 - talk about two very important tools of
159:41 - the transform tab these are the running
159:43 - total tool and the summarize tool
159:45 - so first of all let's start with the
159:47 - running total tool this tool is present
159:50 - in the transform tab in ultrix
159:53 - and it is used to calculate a cumulative
159:55 - sum on a numeric field per record in a
159:58 - fill
160:00 - it can also be used to create sums of
160:02 - groups of records and calculate the
160:04 - cumulative sums of multiple fields
160:07 - at the record or even at the group level
160:10 - so
160:11 - let us understand the usage of this
160:12 - running total tool with the help of an
160:14 - example right so let me just first get
160:17 - my data using this input data tool which
160:20 - is present in the in out tab
160:22 - now let's just click on this drop down
160:24 - and get our excel sheet which is the
160:27 - consumer sheet click on ok
160:29 - now let's just grab this running tool
160:31 - tool and bring it over here
160:34 - here we have two options that are
160:36 - present in this running total tool
160:39 - in the configuration panel that is the
160:40 - group by field which is again optional
160:43 - and the second option is the create
160:44 - running total field
160:46 - so it helps us to create the numeric
160:49 - fields to create a running total
160:50 - basically to select the fields through
160:52 - which we want to create a running total
160:55 - in your database there might be
160:56 - different kinds of fields like the
160:57 - textual fields the date fields
161:01 - a spatial object fields but the running
161:03 - total tool will automatically fetch out
161:05 - the numerical fields and would give you
161:07 - only those fields on which it is
161:09 - applicable right so these are all the
161:11 - numeric fields that are present in my
161:12 - data set that's why it's showing the
161:15 - list of all of them right
161:16 - now
161:17 - uh what you want is you can just select
161:20 - the fields
161:22 - of whose running total you want
161:24 - the new columns would be created and
161:25 - they would be added with a run total
161:28 - underscore prefix
161:30 - to
161:31 - show that this was the original record
161:33 - and this is the total that has been
161:34 - calculated by this particular tool
161:37 - so
161:38 - let's just see how it is going to work i
161:40 - want the
161:42 - total of sales quantity discount and
161:44 - profit these are the four values whose
161:46 - total i want
161:49 - next what i can do is i can click on run
161:51 - and wait for a few seconds till it has
161:53 - finished running
161:55 - this is how it's looking
162:04 - if i just click on this output tab
162:07 - over here or using this anchor
162:10 - then i would be getting these uh four
162:13 - columns running total underscore sales
162:16 - quantity discount and profit
162:18 - this means that this is the total values
162:21 - that have been calculated by this
162:22 - particular tool
162:24 - if you go to the very last record you
162:26 - would be of course getting the highest
162:28 - value or the total value of the sales
162:30 - quantity discount and profit if you take
162:32 - a look on the profit values then there
162:34 - is a point where these values are in
162:36 - negatives which means i'm not getting a
162:38 - total profit i am getting some of the
162:40 - loss from my sales
162:42 - but slowly if you see the values have
162:44 - again
162:46 - converted them into the positives that
162:47 - means the total value is a profit or a
162:49 - loss that would be getting for the last
162:51 - record
162:53 - so this is how the running total uh tool
162:55 - works it is actually used to give you a
162:57 - summary of the numeric fields that i've
162:59 - been working on
163:02 - next we have is the summarize tool now
163:04 - this is a really important tool in
163:06 - altrix and we are going to
163:09 - use it often whenever we are developing
163:11 - the workflows so let us understand it's
163:13 - working first of all
163:14 - it is used to perform the various
163:17 - actions which could be the functions or
163:19 - the calculations on the data
163:21 - it can like return the sum of the column
163:25 - for the data
163:26 - which is
163:28 - basically calculated by adding all the
163:30 - rows in the column
163:31 - it can return the minimum or the maximum
163:33 - value in the column it can count the
163:35 - number of rows it can group the column
163:37 - of a data by identical values it can
163:39 - concatenate the string values it can
163:41 - perform a variety of mathematical
163:43 - calculations and even perform spatial
163:46 - object processing
163:48 - now uh these are a variety of steps that
163:51 - are really important whenever we are
163:53 - working with a workflow right so let's
163:56 - just see some of the actions one by one
163:58 - to understand it
164:00 - let's me just grab my summarize tool and
164:02 - connect it connect my database
164:06 - the database here i'm using is the excel
164:08 - sheet for the consumer segment okay
164:11 - now here we have two things the fields
164:13 - and the actions
164:14 - the fields is basically the data fields
164:17 - that has been taken from the input data
164:19 - set
164:20 - along with its data type okay
164:24 - now what we can do is we can just select
164:26 - some of the fields and if you want to
164:28 - select multiple fields you can just
164:29 - shift and click on them
164:35 - like this okay
164:36 - or what you can do is control click them
164:40 - to select multiple fields
164:43 - then we have is a select option which
164:46 - has different options like all which
164:48 - means it would select all the fields
164:50 - none it would deselect all the fields
164:52 - numeric it would select only the fields
164:54 - with the numeric data type string would
164:56 - select only the string fields and
164:58 - spatial would select only the fields
165:00 - with the spatial data types right
165:02 - so these are the kinds of options that
165:04 - we could perform let me just select the
165:06 - numeric fields so you can see the row id
165:08 - sales quantity discount and profit have
165:10 - been selected
165:12 - next uh what we need to do is once you
165:14 - have selected the fields we come to this
165:16 - add option
165:18 - so uh this add option is actually used
165:20 - to
165:21 - just search for the action that we need
165:22 - to perform you just click on it
165:25 - here are the different options that
165:27 - could be performed we can find the
165:28 - minimum value the maximum value the sum
165:31 - count count non-null count distinct
165:33 - count distinct normal count null
165:36 - group by first last and these are the
165:38 - number of the functions that could be
165:40 - applied like numeric functions string
165:42 - functions
165:44 - uh spatial functions behavioral analysis
165:46 - and the report functions okay
165:48 - so if we just go to the numeric
165:50 - functions uh here is the number of the
165:52 - functions that could be applied like
165:54 - average percentile median and mode
165:56 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm just going
165:58 - to select none and i'm going to show you
166:01 - the different functions that could be
166:02 - applied for each of the data types that
166:04 - is double string
166:06 - and uh we don't have spatial data so let
166:08 - me just go with numeric and the string
166:10 - values only okay so first of all let's
166:11 - just select these four
166:13 - i'm ignoring the row id because that's
166:16 - no need for that
166:17 - next what we can do is just go to this
166:19 - numeric fields and here select the
166:21 - percentile
166:24 - now
166:25 - in the action field we have the fields
166:27 - the action cell could be performed and
166:28 - what would be the name of the output
166:29 - field if you want to change the name of
166:31 - the output field that you can do if you
166:32 - want to change the action that also you
166:33 - can do
166:34 - for example in the case of sales i want
166:37 - the max value
166:39 - in the case of quantity i want the
166:40 - percentile
166:42 - in the case of discount
166:44 - or in the case of discount i want
166:45 - percentile in the quantity again i want
166:47 - the minimum value
166:49 - and in the case of profit i want the
166:52 - sum okay so these are the four different
166:55 - actions that i want to perform on the
166:56 - different fields
166:58 - and once you have selected all of these
166:59 - things you can just simply click on run
167:03 - and wait for a few seconds let's just go
167:05 - to the output
167:06 - so it is giving me the maximum value of
167:08 - the sales
167:09 - the minimum quantity that was purchased
167:11 - was one the percentile discount is point
167:14 - two percent and the total sum of the
167:16 - profit that i have taken is this much of
167:19 - the profit okay
167:22 - uh now
167:23 - the names of the columns have been named
167:26 - accordingly which means you can
167:28 - understand that what's what is going on
167:30 - in these right
167:33 - this is for the numeric values let me
167:35 - just copy this
167:38 - create a new workflow to show some of
167:40 - the functions for the string values as
167:41 - well okay here i can just paste them
167:44 - and for this
167:46 - tool i'm just going to make the changes
167:49 - by selecting the string values
167:52 - and what are
167:53 - those things that i could add is count
167:56 - null count not null so let me just give
167:58 - go with the count
168:01 - if you want to delete any of these
168:02 - actions you can just simply select that
168:04 - action and click on minus select that
168:06 - action click on minus okay
168:08 - so this is what i am going to go with
168:10 - that is the count in the case of
168:12 - category i want count distinct in the
168:14 - case of category a subcategory also i
168:16 - want to count distinct
168:18 - in the case of segment i want
168:21 - count non null
168:23 - in the case of country i want count null
168:27 - and so on okay
168:29 - i have created a bunch of different
168:30 - actions
168:32 - uh in the case of customer id
168:35 - i want the longest okay
168:38 - now once i have selected all these
168:40 - operations i can click on run
168:44 - so it's going to take a few seconds and
168:47 - let us just go to this output to select
168:49 - the uh to just see the values so first
168:52 - of all is count that would give me the
168:53 - count of order id next is count two that
168:55 - is giving me the count of the ship mode
168:57 - which is actually the total number of
168:59 - the records
169:00 - next is the longest customer id then the
169:02 - customer name
169:04 - customer segment
169:05 - then count of the null in the country is
169:08 - zero that means there are no null values
169:09 - right similarly for the count distinct
169:12 - category there are three distinct
169:13 - categories that's why it's giving me the
169:15 - result as uh three
169:17 - similarly in the case of subcategory it
169:19 - is counting it as 17 that are 17
169:22 - distinct subcategories at present
169:24 - and finally we have the count of the
169:26 - product name so there are
169:29 - 5191 products that are available that
169:32 - means
169:33 - everyone has purchased some products
169:35 - so this is how the summarize tool works
169:38 - in the transform tab that's all for this
169:40 - video
169:41 - that's all for the tools for the
169:43 - transform tab
169:45 - and thanks for watching
169:48 - hello everyone welcome back to the
169:50 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
169:52 - going to talk about
169:54 - a new tab
169:56 - that is the reporting tab in our tricks
169:59 - so this tab might not be by default
170:02 - present in your ultrex designer view so
170:04 - what we are going to do is actually
170:07 - see that how can we add the few tabs
170:09 - that are supported by alteryx okay
170:11 - so what we are going to do first of all
170:14 - it's just go to this option this plus
170:16 - icon
170:17 - which would automatically give you an
170:19 - option to add or remove the tools so
170:21 - let's just click on that
170:22 - this would open up the configure tool
170:24 - palette that means all the tools that
170:27 - are actually supported by address but
170:28 - are not being shown on your screen right
170:30 - now
170:31 - so here if you just go
170:33 - and check there are many of the tools
170:35 - that are actually supported by ultrex
170:37 - okay
170:38 - so from here what i'm gonna do is i'm
170:40 - just going to support uh this
170:42 - check on this reporting tab
170:45 - so this would give me a bunch of other
170:48 - tools that i'm gonna use
170:50 - uh like email image insight interactive
170:52 - chart layout
170:54 - map legend overlay render report
170:57 - and table okay so let's just click on ok
171:00 - once we do that this is the reporting
171:02 - tab that would be present in front of us
171:05 - and these are the tools supported by the
171:06 - reporting tab
171:08 - in this video we are going to take a
171:09 - look at the table tool and the
171:11 - interactive chart tool which are of very
171:14 - important
171:16 - in this whole workflow building thing
171:19 - okay
171:19 - so first of all let's just bring up the
171:21 - table tool
171:24 - now uh i have already used the input
171:26 - data tool to get my data set
171:29 - let us just understand the usage of the
171:31 - table tool as the name suggests table
171:33 - tool is used to create a data table or a
171:36 - pivot table to output the report through
171:39 - the render tool okay
171:42 - so as you can see this is the render
171:43 - tool if you want to output the report
171:45 - the render tool is what we are going to
171:46 - use
171:48 - so uh if we just talk about this tool we
171:50 - first have the table mode which means
171:52 - you can select the basic table or the
171:53 - pivot table
171:54 - pivot table is
171:56 - uh basically used when we are using the
171:59 - data from the crosstab tool
172:01 - in case you have not seen the video the
172:02 - crosstab tool i would recommend you to
172:04 - first go and watch it and then you would
172:07 - be able to understand it easier
172:09 - uh that what i'm trying to say okay so
172:11 - i'm just going to go with the basic
172:12 - table
172:14 - next option we have is the group by
172:16 - option that means the fields through
172:18 - which you want to group by these um
172:20 - values if there is anything so what i'm
172:23 - going to do is i'm just going to group
172:24 - by category
172:26 - and sub category okay
172:28 - next we have is the value of a table
172:31 - width which is basically
172:34 - how you want to
172:36 - adjust your table so automatic that
172:39 - means the minimum width percentage you
172:40 - want a particular percentage fix you
172:42 - want a particular fixed value okay so
172:44 - i'm just gonna go with automatic
172:46 - right next we have is the
172:51 - column headings if you want to show the
172:54 - column headings or not
172:56 - then we have the option of a bar graph
172:59 - so if you want to create a bar graph
173:03 - just a second let me just adjust it a
173:05 - little bit
173:08 - yeah
173:09 - so if you want to create a bar graph
173:11 - that means you can specify the data
173:13 - field for which the bar graph needs to
173:15 - be created in the table
173:18 - and this bar graph option is only
173:20 - available for the basic table in case
173:22 - you have selected the pivot table over
173:23 - here then this option would not be
173:25 - available
173:26 - now you can just click on the settings
173:28 - to modify the style of the graph
173:31 - like its weight scale its space value
173:34 - label bars colors etc but i'm not just
173:36 - gonna go into very much deep into this
173:38 - bar graph option right now right now
173:40 - we're just going to focus on the table
173:42 - tool okay
173:44 - uh next is show column headings which is
173:46 - of course let me just uncheck this bar
173:48 - graph so that would be
173:50 - available to us if you want to show the
173:52 - column headings
173:53 - then we have the per column or the
173:54 - methodology configuration option
173:57 - if the table mode is basic then we can
174:00 - configure the columns and if the table
174:03 - mode is the pivot
174:05 - mode then we need to configure the
174:06 - methodologies so in case we have
174:09 - selected basic mode so we are getting
174:11 - the option as per column configuration
174:13 - now we can use
174:15 - it to select the data fields that we
174:17 - want to include in the table
174:19 - using these up and down arrows that are
174:21 - present over here we can just
174:23 - set their order
174:25 - uh we can just rename these fields as
174:27 - well so what i'm gonna do is i'm just
174:28 - gonna uncheck some of these fields
174:32 - okay and i'm just going to go with the
174:38 - only few fields over here okay
174:41 - uh category is a category product name
174:48 - like this okay
174:50 - i am just uh interested in these fields
174:53 - only okay
174:55 - now if you want uh to configure the
174:58 - attributes of a particular field you can
174:59 - just select that particular field and
175:00 - these attributes would be available for
175:02 - you if you want to get a new name for
175:04 - the field so
175:06 - insert the consumer name i'm just going
175:08 - to go with the name
175:10 - if you want to select its width its
175:12 - alignment its borders prefix surface
175:15 - anything you want to select you can just
175:17 - select
175:19 - uh this dec places for the number of the
175:21 - decimal places so if you just select
175:23 - some numerical value let's say the sales
175:25 - value so this field would be
175:28 - enabled okay and like in the prefix i
175:31 - want a dollar symbol to show me that
175:34 - this was the
175:35 - dollar amount and in the end i want to
175:39 - i don't want any suffix just for the
175:40 - prefix i want the dollar okay
175:43 - for the sales
175:44 - and
175:45 - that's it if you want to create some of
175:47 - the column rules you can just create the
175:48 - column rules which basically uh says
175:51 - that what you want to do if you want to
175:53 - apply some kind of a formatting
175:56 - for it so
175:57 - the sales rule one is
175:59 - you apply to the data when
176:02 - the
176:04 - sales is
176:05 - greater than equal to
176:08 - a thousand dollars
176:10 - you can just say
176:13 - the
176:13 - background color
176:15 - must be kind of like green
176:18 - so if the sales value is greater than a
176:20 - thousand dollar i want a green
176:22 - uh background color okay
176:25 - so this is the rule that i have applied
176:28 - okay
176:30 - now
176:30 - next two options we have is the default
176:32 - table settings that means the
176:34 - style options that we want our table to
176:37 - contain would be changed over here or if
176:40 - you want to create a rule for um to be
176:43 - applied to all the columns of the data
176:45 - that you can apply using this create row
176:47 - rule option
176:49 - so
176:50 - these are the options that you can
176:51 - control or configure in this table tool
176:55 - now once you are happy with the changes
176:57 - that you have made you can click on run
177:01 - and
177:02 - yes
177:03 - so here is how the output is looking
177:07 - we have categorized them or we have
177:09 - grouped them on the basis of category
177:11 - and sub category
177:13 - uh and this is the table
177:16 - uh this is the table that we have got
177:18 - over here just a second
177:24 - okay
177:26 - now
177:26 - uh
177:28 - if you want to get
177:31 - to
177:32 - show the staple how would you be able to
177:34 - show it so for that what we need to do
177:37 - is
177:39 - to view the individual records and see
177:42 - whether the changes that you have made
177:44 - in the table are been actually made or
177:46 - not we can simply use a browse tool that
177:49 - is present in the in out tab okay
177:51 - so once we have used the browse tool and
177:53 - run the workflow this is the kind of the
177:55 - output that we would be getting as you
177:57 - can see the number of the fields have
177:58 - been reduced drastically
178:01 - we are now only getting the fields
178:03 - which we actually
178:06 - modified right
178:08 - and if you just want to scroll up and
178:10 - down to get a better view that also you
178:12 - can get
178:14 - here you can see in the sales the prefix
178:16 - is added that is a dollar symbol
178:18 - and whenever the sales quantity is more
178:21 - than a thousand dollars we are getting
178:23 - the color the background color as green
178:25 - this was the rule that we created for
178:27 - this values right so you can see all
178:29 - these values are colored in green now so
178:32 - this is how the whole field or the whole
178:34 - table tool is looking
178:37 - now let us talk about how can you
178:39 - actually render this table okay
178:43 - now here what we have done is created a
178:46 - copy of these
178:47 - two things the basic table and the data
178:51 - in order to render it we go to the
178:52 - reporting tab and grab the render tool
178:54 - the render tool is actually used to
178:57 - render or transform the report snippets
178:59 - into the presentation quality reports
179:02 - into a variety of formats now the
179:04 - formats supported by it are these html
179:07 - compressor pdf rdf word excel png image
179:10 - or a specific output file so from this
179:12 - you need to select the specific output
179:14 - file option in the output file you can
179:16 - just click on this save file
179:19 - and select the format in which you want
179:21 - to save the file i am going with the
179:22 - excel and here you need to type a name
179:24 - so let me just
179:26 - grab the name that is report
179:29 - table
179:30 - over here and click on save now once you
179:33 - do that uh the
179:36 - path would be taken
179:38 - you can just select these different
179:41 - options like if you want a header you
179:42 - want a footer
179:44 - for the table or not
179:46 - that you can just select okay the page
179:48 - of this
179:50 - paper size the orientation for the
179:52 - report as well
179:53 - then click on run
179:55 - once you do that
179:57 - the rendering
179:59 - needs to be completed
180:01 - so let's see when it's completed
180:03 - you can just go to this location where
180:06 - you have saved the file and
180:08 - you would see that the changes have been
180:10 - made so here is the report table that we
180:12 - just created the excel sheet and this is
180:15 - how it is looking
180:16 - uh it has been rendered as it is we
180:19 - required like all the changes all the
180:21 - rules have been applied so that's all
180:23 - for the render tool and that's all for
180:25 - this video as well thanks for watching
180:28 - hello everyone welcome to ultrex
180:30 - tutorials in this video we are going to
180:32 - talk about the creation of a visual data
180:36 - representation in ultrix so it is
180:39 - possible through
180:40 - different tools but we would be looking
180:42 - at the table tool and the interactive
180:45 - chart tool which are primarily used for
180:48 - this purpose so if we talk about the
180:51 - table tool we have studied all about it
180:53 - in the previous video in case you
180:55 - haven't watched it already i would
180:56 - recommend you to just go there and watch
180:59 - it first to understand its basics
181:01 - because in this video i'm not just going
181:03 - to explain the basics again i'm simply
181:06 - just going to show you the application
181:08 - of the uh table tool
181:10 - especially the bar chart part
181:12 - so let's just go to the table tool or
181:15 - this is the basic table tool that we
181:16 - have been using
181:18 - now here if you see there is this option
181:20 - of bar craft so what i have done over
181:22 - here is in this bar graph option i have
181:25 - selected sales
181:26 - and the settings all the settings i have
181:28 - kept as same
181:30 - okay or basically the default settings
181:33 - then what i have done is i have used the
181:35 - render tool and in the render tool i
181:37 - have
181:38 - uh outputted it in the form of a pdf
181:41 - file so once i run this workflow what
181:43 - would happen is i would be getting this
181:46 - kind of a report
181:47 - now all the settings for the table tool
181:50 - are same as we did for the previous file
181:53 - but the format of the file has changed
181:55 - from excel to pdf right now now you can
181:58 - see all these things have been shown
182:00 - like this only but whatever the sales
182:02 - amount is like 732 is the sales amount
182:04 - so a bar a slide bar of light blue color
182:07 - is shown along with its value 71 for 90.
182:11 - so this is how the bar chart tool works
182:14 - we have selected it for the sales value
182:15 - so for the sales value
182:17 - this is how it's been shown
182:19 - like it shows us the bar
182:21 - that would
182:22 - roughly give us an estimate of the
182:24 - quantity that is being or the total
182:26 - sales amount that it is contributing
182:29 - ah with respect to the total amount so
182:32 - this is how we can use the bar chart of
182:34 - the visual representation within a table
182:36 - using the table tool
182:38 - now let us move on to the tool that is
182:39 - specifically designed for this purpose
182:41 - and that is the interactive chart tool
182:44 - so first of all let me just save this
182:46 - workflow and close it because we don't
182:48 - need it anymore
182:50 - we are going to take a look at the
182:51 - interactive chart tool now
182:54 - now what is this interactive chart tool
182:56 - it is used to basically visualize the
182:58 - data in the workflow we can create
183:00 - charts uh interactive multi-layered bar
183:02 - charts line graphs scatter plots pie
183:05 - charts and more we can use your uh the
183:08 - data set that we've been using to
183:10 - calculate the sum count average minimum
183:12 - maximum of the selected fields and
183:14 - output them into the different file
183:17 - types again using the render tool so
183:19 - first of all let's just get the input
183:21 - file this is our input tool let me just
183:23 - get the file i'm starting with a simple
183:25 - file so let's just go with this course
183:27 - file right now
183:30 - and now what i'm gonna do is apply the
183:32 - interactive chart
183:34 - uh tool over here okay
183:36 - so
183:38 - we can just configure the chart by
183:40 - clicking on this configure chart option
183:43 - and it's going to open up this kind of a
183:45 - dialog box the interactive chart dialog
183:46 - box which would help us to configure the
183:49 - chart okay so we can just create the
183:51 - chart over here
183:53 - in this as you can see there is a format
183:55 - of a chart that's been given to us
183:57 - so we can just create the chart like
183:59 - this
184:01 - control the zoom control the
184:03 - location and everything okay
184:06 - so for this data first you have to
184:08 - ensure that what kind of a chart you
184:10 - want to create i want to create a bar
184:12 - chart okay
184:13 - so once you are in this interactive
184:15 - chart
184:16 - workflow you can just go to create click
184:19 - on layer and here you need to just
184:21 - select on add layer option
184:23 - uh you can give a name to the layer by
184:25 - default it's taken as layer 0 but you
184:27 - can give it any name so what i'm going
184:29 - to do is i'm just going to add bar
184:31 - chart okay
184:34 - then we have the type option in this you
184:37 - need to just select the type of the
184:38 - chart to the bar
184:40 - then uh we have the
184:42 - x which means you need to select the
184:44 - column of which you want on the x axis
184:47 - so i want the uh score on the x-axis on
184:51 - the y-axis i want the number of hours
184:53 - okay
184:54 - so that's number of hours
184:56 - and scores to be taken over here okay
184:59 - then what we can do is we can just
185:06 - go to the template if you want a
185:08 - particular template to be used otherwise
185:10 - we can just
185:12 - go with it and
185:15 - so once you have made all the changes as
185:17 - per your choice you can just close that
185:19 - dialog box and bring in the browse tool
185:22 - this would help you to take a look at
185:23 - the chart that you have created so this
185:25 - is the bar chart that we have created
185:27 - based on the data
185:29 - as you can see um
185:31 - here is 98 that is the score and nine is
185:34 - the number of the hours the student has
185:36 - studied so this is how we have got the
185:38 - chart for us but
185:40 - uh if you want to just zoom in you can
185:42 - just zoom in and out of it to get a
185:43 - better look at how the things are
185:45 - looking inside the chart
185:48 - right so this is how basically the chart
185:50 - is created and if you want to create it
185:52 - for different things what we can do is
185:54 - first of all get rid of this data set
185:58 - and bring in our sales data because it
186:00 - has more scope of grading charts it has
186:02 - more values right
186:04 - so let's just go to this output excel
186:06 - file
186:07 - and get in our consumer data set right
186:10 - again we go to this chart option
186:11 - configure chart
186:14 - now there are all types of
186:15 - configurations that you can apply uh
186:18 - right now you can see the score and the
186:19 - number of hours is missing so what we
186:21 - can do is just get rid of it add a new
186:24 - layer
186:24 - again it's going to be a bar chart
186:30 - right now the type is again going to be
186:32 - bar
186:33 - in the column uh i'm just going to get
186:35 - the
186:37 - in the x axis i'm just going to get the
186:40 - sales amount
186:42 - and in the y i'm just going to get the
186:45 - category
186:47 - okay so the category by sales is what i
186:49 - want
186:50 - uh next what i can do is just basically
186:53 - close it go to the browse tool and run
186:55 - it to get the overview
186:58 - it's going to take a few seconds
187:00 - depending upon the processing speed of
187:02 - your computer and then it would render
187:04 - an output for you
187:06 - so once we have made the changes uh then
187:10 - this is how the output would be looking
187:12 - uh this is the sales on the basis of the
187:15 - category that is furniture office
187:16 - applies in the technology category
187:19 - and these are the individual sales
187:20 - records that we are getting right now
187:22 - okay uh now using this uh chart tool we
187:26 - can actually configure the chart the way
187:28 - we like okay so there are multiple
187:30 - configuration options that are available
187:33 - like if you just go to this layer option
187:35 - there are these different types of um
187:39 - options that you can perform
187:42 - like uh the opacity you can select the
187:44 - border width you can select
187:46 - the border color you can just select and
187:48 - everything like this okay
187:51 - so this is how it's gonna look
187:54 - um
187:56 - we can just select the different bar
187:57 - modes like stack or overlay
188:00 - or relative to one another
188:04 - next we have is the option for the
188:06 - legion so if you want to work with the
188:08 - legions like if you want to show the
188:10 - lesions or not
188:11 - then you can just select them also you
188:13 - can just
188:15 - hide them all together if you don't want
188:17 - to be shown
188:19 - in the layers panel
188:21 - here you can just select the orientation
188:23 - of the chart as well
188:25 - like this
188:29 - okay
188:30 - so this is what we can do
188:33 - then we have this access part where we
188:35 - can just select the display range like
188:38 - what is the maximum and the minimum
188:39 - range that you want
188:41 - the access line you want to show or hide
188:43 - the grid lines you want to show or hide
188:47 - etc all these things you can just select
188:49 - okay
188:52 - and then we have the batch if you want
188:54 - to create patched charts or not
188:56 - so this is how we work with these charts
188:58 - uh this is a simple bar chart that we
189:00 - have created now let us just move on to
189:03 - another type of a chart uh that we are
189:05 - going to create which is a pie chart
189:06 - let's just see how do we create that
189:08 - real quick
189:10 - so what i'm gonna do is just create a
189:12 - new workflow
189:14 - and in this i'm just going to copy these
189:16 - two
189:17 - tools
189:19 - actually the three tools can be copied
189:22 - all of these three rules can be copied
189:24 - and pasted over here
189:26 - now for the pie chart what we are going
189:27 - to do is actually create it on the basis
189:30 - of the sales and the category that means
189:32 - there are three categories and i'm just
189:34 - going to get the bifurcated amount of
189:36 - sales for each of these categories
189:38 - so um
189:40 - let's see how do we do that
189:42 - so in the configure chart option we go
189:44 - to the layer and just select the type to
189:47 - pi
189:48 - the values i have taken to sales and the
189:51 - labels i have set to category this is
189:53 - how it is looking
189:55 - and the name of course i have renamed it
189:57 - to pie chart for more clarity on what is
189:59 - going on
190:00 - now this is how it is looking it is
190:02 - giving me the percentage of the sales
190:04 - in case you want to give it a chart
190:06 - title you can just click here and
190:09 - provide it with a title
190:10 - or if you want to save it as a png file
190:12 - you can just click on this floppy disk
190:14 - icon and you would be able to save it so
190:17 - i'm just going to save it as a chart
190:20 - and let's just see how it is looking so
190:22 - this is my chart.png
190:25 - this is how it's looking this is a
190:26 - legend that tells you that blue
190:28 - represents technology orange represents
190:30 - furniture and green represents office
190:32 - supplies so that's how the charts are
190:34 - created in ultrix that's all for this
190:35 - video thanks for watching
190:39 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
190:41 - tutorials in this video we are going to
190:43 - take a look at the chart creation
190:45 - process only
190:47 - but in this video we are going to take a
190:49 - look at how can we create batch charts
190:51 - and what is basically the concept of
190:53 - batch charts in ultrix so the batch
190:56 - charts are basically used to group the
190:58 - data as we
191:00 - previously saw in the video that we
191:02 - created a pie chart which provided us
191:04 - the sales percentage and the sales
191:07 - amount on the basis of the category now
191:09 - there are two things as we know in our
191:11 - data set that are present for grouping
191:13 - the data that is category and
191:14 - subcategory
191:16 - so here we have category and then we
191:17 - have sub category so what i want to do
191:20 - is i want to create separate pie charts
191:22 - for three separate categories
191:24 - firstly in the furniture
191:26 - category chart i want the different sub
191:30 - categories that are part of the
191:32 - furniture and then i want them to show
191:33 - me that what is the total sales that has
191:36 - been done in each of these categories
191:39 - right similarly i want to create it for
191:41 - office supplies category and then for
191:43 - the technology category now instead of
191:45 - creating three charts
191:47 - each for separate categories what i'm
191:48 - going gonna do is i'm just going to
191:50 - create a single chart
191:52 - with the help of the bad chart option
191:54 - alteryx would automatically create
191:56 - copies of the same chart for me right so
191:58 - let us see how we are going to do that
192:02 - here what we have is three tools the
192:04 - input tool the
192:06 - chart tool and the browse tool so first
192:08 - of all let's just go to the interactive
192:10 - chart tool click on configure chart
192:11 - option in the configuration panel
192:13 - to open up this interactive chart okay
192:16 - now first of all you need to go to this
192:17 - batch option and by default it would be
192:19 - turned to off so you need to click it to
192:21 - on
192:23 - it would ask you to select the columns
192:25 - through which you are going to group by
192:26 - your options so uh i'm going to group
192:29 - them by category so from the drop down
192:31 - you can just select category if you want
192:34 - another field through which you want to
192:35 - group it by so you can select the second
192:37 - field as well
192:39 - if you want custom title for the batched
192:41 - charts that you can
192:43 - do
192:44 - but i'm not just going to go with it uh
192:46 - the category is written and i'm fine
192:48 - with it okay
192:49 - next go to the layers option click on
192:52 - add layer
192:53 - and let's just provide it a name like pi
192:56 - chart
193:01 - okay
193:02 - now select the type to pi
193:05 - for the values what i'm going to do is
193:07 - select the sales value
193:09 - and let's just give it a few seconds
193:13 - till it is going to fetch all the
193:14 - records from the sales and put them over
193:16 - here
193:17 - so this kind of a chart is being
193:18 - generated which is of course very
193:20 - difficult to understand because it is
193:22 - not a correct chart
193:24 - then what i am going to do in the labels
193:25 - column i am going to select the sub
193:28 - category
193:29 - so now
193:31 - our chart is clean and what we are
193:32 - getting over here is the name of the
193:34 - category which is furniture
193:36 - now in this furniture we have four sub
193:38 - categories the chairs which is
193:40 - represented in the blue color tables
193:42 - represented in the orange color
193:44 - bookcase is represented in the green
193:46 - color and furnishings represented in the
193:48 - red color so the total sales of the
193:50 - furniture
193:53 - whatever the total sales value of the
193:55 - furnitures was it has been bifurcated
193:58 - into these four subcategories and
194:01 - it has uh taken the percentages as this
194:04 - so in the furniture most of the sales
194:06 - has been done by chairs that is 43.6
194:08 - percent then if we just click on the
194:11 - second page we would have the office
194:13 - supplies category
194:15 - which combines these subcategories from
194:17 - storage till fasteners
194:20 - now in each of these sub categories how
194:22 - the bifurcation of the sales has been
194:24 - done is being shown on the percentage
194:26 - basis on the third we have the third
194:28 - subcategory which is the technology
194:30 - category having four subcategories again
194:32 - with phones accessories machines and
194:34 - copiers
194:36 - now what customizations we can do over
194:37 - here is
194:39 - by going into this chart option
194:44 - uh and in this font option like if you
194:45 - want to change the font it says
194:47 - everything that you can change like if
194:50 - you want to increase the size so as to
194:51 - get a better look at what is happening
194:53 - over here
194:54 - okay
194:55 - then we have layers option through which
194:57 - you can just uh change the colors like
195:00 - these are the colors that have been
195:01 - taken by default but if you want some
195:03 - other color scheme to be there you want
195:05 - some other
195:06 - colors to be there that also you can
195:08 - change
195:09 - okay
195:11 - like this the divergent scales are there
195:15 - or the sequential scales are there to
195:19 - for a particular color that you can just
195:21 - select okay
195:22 - uh then we have the slice label that is
195:24 - what you want to be shown on the slice
195:26 - label right now the percentage has been
195:28 - shown if you want the value has to be
195:29 - shown as well that means what is the
195:31 - total number of sales that was done that
195:34 - you want to show and the label that
195:36 - means the value of the subcategory that
195:38 - to which subcategory it belongs that
195:40 - also you can select i'm just going with
195:42 - label and percentage not with the value
195:43 - part
195:44 - the order is sorted which means they are
195:46 - all sorted and if you want to show the
195:49 - legend or not this is the legion part
195:50 - you want to show it you want to hide it
195:53 - and then if you just hover over it then
195:56 - we are getting some additional
195:57 - information as well so that is uh
196:00 - controlled through this over text value
196:02 - so i don't want the percentage to be
196:04 - shown i just want the label and the
196:05 - values to be shown over here okay
196:06 - because the percentage is already
196:08 - visible over here
196:10 - next we have is the chart option which
196:11 - you can use to set the width of the
196:14 - chart
196:15 - in pixels or in inches
196:17 - you can just select the um
196:19 - margins and the padding color etc the
196:23 - background color of the chart everything
196:25 - that you want you can just control from
196:26 - here okay
196:28 - so this is a custom color that i want
196:31 - uh this is the title
196:34 - if you want to change the title you can
196:35 - change it over here using latex or using
196:39 - a simple
196:40 - uh text as well
196:41 - then we have the access option
196:43 - which is not uh been used over here next
196:46 - we have is the legion if you want to
196:48 - just change the way the legend is being
196:50 - shown that you can do you can just work
196:53 - with its size its color
196:56 - let me just get a black color for the
196:57 - legend
196:59 - for better visibility
197:01 - then we have the box if you want a box
197:04 - to be there on the legend
197:06 - the color of the border for the legion
197:08 - it's going to be red
197:11 - and the background color or if you want
197:13 - a different background color let's just
197:14 - go with
197:16 - this kind of color
197:18 - the orientation you wanted vertically or
197:20 - horizontally like this
197:22 - and the layer order of
197:24 - that what is the order of the layers
197:27 - accordingly you want that or not okay so
197:29 - this is where it is starting from
197:31 - storage all the way to fasteners okay
197:34 - uh then
197:35 - you can just close this
197:37 - and using the browse tool you can just
197:39 - run the browse tool to get a look at the
197:42 - chart
197:47 - so here it is how it is looking you can
197:49 - just adjust it
197:51 - and see that these three charts are
197:52 - lined one after the other
197:55 - now let us just render this chart using
197:57 - the render tool so let's just delete
197:59 - this browse tool for a bit
198:02 - go to the reporting and here we have
198:04 - this render
198:06 - in this render what i'm gonna do is just
198:09 - select the
198:12 - specific output file and save it
198:16 - uh in the form of
198:18 - png images three images would be created
198:21 - and select
198:23 - bulk charts or batch charts okay
198:30 - now click on save
198:32 - and if you just go to that location
198:36 - bad charts.png
198:38 - is what we are getting over here
198:42 - okay so let me just
198:44 - take a look at this
198:52 - so uh this is the kind of the image that
198:54 - we are getting over here
198:57 - and if you just zoom in these are being
199:00 - created like this
199:01 - uh in the form of a png image okay now
199:04 - let's see what happens if we just um
199:06 - store it in the form of a pdf document
199:09 - so for saving it i'm just going to
199:12 - select a pdf document
199:16 - here
199:17 - and just select batch charts as the name
199:23 - click on save
199:25 - and click on run to run the workflow so
199:28 - that the actual uh saving process occurs
199:32 - okay now let's just see how it is
199:34 - looking
199:37 - so here it is three pages have been
199:38 - created for the pdf each for a different
199:40 - category along with its legend along
199:43 - with its chart along with its everything
199:46 - so this is how we can use the render
199:48 - button to render the batch charts for us
199:51 - and that's all for this video with this
199:53 - we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course
199:56 - on ultrix as well
199:58 - during this course we learned about the
200:00 - different tools and their
200:02 - functionalities we also got to
200:04 - see that what all actions we can perform
200:07 - through alteryx
200:08 - and we got to understand that there are
200:10 - a bunch of things that we can do now
200:13 - with more practice we would be able to
200:14 - create a really good charts for us
200:17 - render them and
200:19 - use it as the tool it is meant to be
200:22 - so that's all for this video that's all
200:24 - for this course
200:26 - i hope you all learned something new
200:28 - throughout this course i really hope you
200:29 - all enjoyed this journey
200:31 - uh thanks for watching goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to this course altrex for beginners in this course we would be discussing all about a tool called altrix we would be learning its practical concepts and we would be also seeing that why is it so useful also i would be showing you the procedure through which you can use it into your day to day lives also we would be seeing that what difference it is going to make and how it is going to prove useful to us so in this video we are going to introduce ourselves to this particular tool and discuss about its features so that you can decide whether to go for this course or not so this is the first video introduction to alteryx let us start by understanding that what actually is ultrix so alteryx is a tool that is primarily used for data cleaning so whenever you have a data set with you and you want to clean it then ninety percent of the task of data cleaning can be done automatically through ultrix apart from this the different features provided by alteryx are all combined into this slide altryx is not just only a data cleaning tool but it is also a predictive analysis tool predictive analysis means that a variety of statistical techniques are combined from like data mining predictive modeling and machine learning which will analyze the historical trends and will make predictions about the future so for this purpose we can use alteryx if you want spatial analysis that is when you want to analyze the locations uh relationships or basically the proximities in a geospatial data to extract the insights then you can use the stool ultrix altex also acts as an etl tool that means to extract transform and load the general procedure of copying the data from one source to destination which can then be used to visualize the data or represent it in a completely different format altryx also acts as a data blending tool that means you can get a data from the different sources and then merge it into a single data warehouse or basically a data set and then analyze it last but not the least ultra excesses says service analysis tool now what is this means cell service analysis tool so once you have created something called a workflow in ultrix now you do not need to create it again and again what you can do is simply combine the alteryx to just follow the same procedures that you have done up till now and ultrix would automatically do the same tasks for you means you can just create the workflow once and use it as many times as you want there is no limit on um using it you can create once used many times now let us understand that why should we use alteryx so these are some of the features that helps us to understand that why alteryx is so much important for us first of all no coding knowledge is needed for this tool it has a very simple interface if you have a knowledge of excel and some of the features of excel like pivot tables or vlookup then you can simply use eltrix for all of your needs so that is why if you do not have a strong coding background then you can use alteryx as well it has a very simple drag and drop interface all of the filters or all of the features all of the tools that you want to use that you can simply just drag and drop suppose you want to sort the data so we have a sorting tool provided to us in altrix all you need to do is drag it and drop it on your dataset and the data side would be sorted if you want to filter it according to particular criteria similarly you can just drag the filter tool and drop it over there and that particular filter would be applied it is compatible with different data sources around uh 80 plus data sources are supported by alteryx that means you can use the data set which is in any format it could be in the form of an excel file a csv file or basically a semistructured or unstructured json file as well you can simply use it in ultrix import it in altrics and actually analyze it using the tool because it supports a variety of data sources the integration with the power bi tools with the business intelligence tools like power bi tableau qlik sense is also provided to irig so once you have created some of the insights in those tools you can easily interact with that report or with that dashboard using altrix you can actually make a connection between those two and get a better insight of your data now uh the last but not the least it is actually the most important feature of alteryx that is it provides automation of the manual tasks so all the tasks that you have been doing manually up till now you can actually automate them with the help of alteryx and once you have automated those tasks and once the workflow is created you do not have to create it again and again simply you can reuse it as many times as you want now let us take a look at some of the features of alteryx and these are the same features that make it so special so first of all is that it supports 80 plus data sources as we have already discussed the data files that you are using in altrix can be in any format like a csv file an excel file json file xml file html file any type of a file if it contains data it is supported by altx you can simply just use it you can import it in address and then uh analyze it one more thing this number of the data sources is actually increasing as new versions of altrix are being released so uh even if your uh data source is not compatible right now it might come in the future it supports all the formats of data like it may be a structured data in the form of a sequel it could be semistructured or unstructured data in the form of a json files so whatever the format of the data is it is supported by altrix you don't have to worry about the data format if it is not in a tabular format or so there are 260 plus automation tools that are available for analytics in altrix now these automation tools not only reduce our tasks but also make the analysis and the data cleaning process very smooth like you want to filter out some records you want to sort out some records all you have to do is just use these automation tools through a simple drag and drop and use them on your data set and just see that how it works you do not need to perform complex procedures you do not need any kind of according knowledge for this purpose just drag and drop report creation is supported from different data sources that means uh the different bi tools or the different data sources you can create reports using those like once you have created a report or a workflow in altrix then uh you can actually use the different data sources for different sorts of visualizations to be combined together in a single report so this is one of the best features supported by ultrix now once you have created the report and you want to share it with uh your team or with a different set of people then you can export this report in the different file formats that are supported by altrics like pdf excel file or many more uh and also with the upcoming versions this number of uh file formats are supported by address is also increasing finally altric supports the reusable workflows what does it means it means that once you have created a workflow you can reuse it as many times as you want you do not need to just perform those same steps again and again and again you can just simply reuse the workflow that you have already created so this is about the features of alteryx and now uh since we know about the basics of altrix and why is it so useful let us see that how can we actually install alteryx into our systems so it is a paid tool but you can get a trial version of 14 days for yourself so we would be just using that trial version only right now okay so for this what you need to do is just basically google ultrix here you will see this website official website www.altrex.com in this official website you need to go to this products option so once this products option is open you will see that these are these different products that are available like designer server intelligence suite etc from this we need to go with this designer product because it is suitable for individuals so let's just click on this learn more option once you click on this learn more option you will go to this home page of this particular product which is ultrex designer product you can just read all about it the system requirements and the features of this particular product then if you want to install it you can just click on start free trial if you want to watch a demo you can just go with the remove video let's just click on start free trial now what will it do is it will ask you if you are a new user or if you are an existing user or whatever so i'm a new user let's just click on a new user download now button now what will you do is it will ask you all of these details so you what you need to do is just actually provide all these details and once you have provided these details you can click on confirm once you will click on confirm the downloading process for an exe file will start for you so uh that's it that's the simple process for downloading this particular setup in the previous video we have already seen the features of alteryx and how to actually install its setup so now as you can see the exe file is already downloaded i'm just going to click on it to open it up and just work you out throughout this installation process right it is a very simple installation process so first of all what you need to do is you need to just go with the first option which is a typical ultrex version if you want uh our programming language based predictive tools which is an advanced version of alteryx you can go for it but since this course is aimed at beginners so we are just going with the typical version the language you can select i'm just going with english let's click on next then it is going to download all the required files so let's just wait for a few seconds till these files are downloaded now once all the required files are downloaded this kind of a menu will appear in front of you where it would be just verifying all the contents of the setup package so you need to wait for a few seconds let's just meet after this has been done now it will ask for uh where to install the application so you can just select a particular folder but i'm just going with the default path let's click on next accept the license agreement again click on next and then it's again going to take a few seconds to install the whole program onto your system now once all the installation process has been completed you would be getting just a screen just like this make sure this box is checked on and click on finish now once this box is checked on ultrix would automatically be running onto your system now once the altrix application has been launched onto your system it would ask you to enter a license key if you have a license key you can just enter it or you can simply click on start free trial then it would ask your mail address and just remember this thing that this should be the same email address that you needed to provide once you were registering like when you were providing your details the email address you entered over there that's the same address that you need to provide over here so let's just enter this email address and click on continue now once you have entered your email address it would ask you whether you want to include the ultrix intelligence suite in your package or not so for now what we can do is just click on this i'll try it later option because i just don't want to use it right now and you can click on start solving so once you have done all these steps this kind of a dialog box would appear for the tour we can just click on closed tour because we don't need it right so this is how the ultrex user interface is looking let us take a quick look at all the operations that are going to be of use to us so first of all we have this menu bar with the usual options like file edit view and many more if you just hover over it you will find these different options right next we have is this tabs these are the different tabs having different functionalities like if you want some to add some of the tools then you can use these tabs like for data preparation for joining for parsing for transforming for the machine learning etc these different tools are available if you want to use any tools what you need to do is just go to its tab get that tool suppose i want to apply a filter just drag it and drop it over here this place where drop tools here is written it is known as a workflow or canvas so you can just drop that particular tool over here and then you would be able to use it now once you've dropped a tool you can see that something changed over here this is a configuration window which would help us to configure this tools like if you want to apply a filter what kind of a filter you want to apply the basic filter or a custom filter in a basic filter what changes you want to do so all these customizations or configurations can be done through this tab known as the configuration tab now once you have configured all the tools into the canvas you can click on this button that is known as the run button to actually run this workflow the shortcut is ctrl r so either you can use the shortcut or just the run button then what will happen is you would be getting a result or an output so this result would be shown over here in this window this is known as the results window this is where the output would be shown to you right next we have is the search part that is really important especially for the beginners like there are different tabs and the different tools are actually separated in those steps suppose you want to search for a particular tool like let's say you want to search for a formula so we can just simply type formula and you would see this formula is over here you can just use it like this you can just drag it and drop it over here like this okay so this search bar would be of very use to us next we have is this kind of a plus sign so if you want to add or remove some of the tools because there are many tools supported by ultrix not all are shown over here you want to add or remove them you can just simply use this option suppose i don't want this sdk example so let's just uncheck this and in case of that i want a special analysis right so let's just check on spatial and click on ok so what would happen is as you can see the spatial has been added over here and the sdk analysis has been gone from here so this is how you can work with the simple interface of ultrix this is just the introduction part in this video we are going to see that how can we actually import a file into alteryx now altrex supports different formats of the file so no matter if your data is in the form of an excel file or a csv file or basically any of the formats that are supported by ultrix the importing process is going to be same in this video i'm going to import an excel file and show you that how it's done similarly you can just duplicate the steps for any of the file extensions that you have so let us start with the video this is the altrix interface and i have already created a new workflow now once you want to do anything in ultrix you need to create a workflow because that is like the basic building block in altrix so let me first show you how to create a workflow to create a workflow you can do three steps or basically any of the three process you can follow to create a workflow first of all is in this particular window there is this plus sign if you just click on this a new workflow would be created like new workflow two if you want to close the workflow of course there is this cross sign through which you can close this workflow the second way is that you can just go to this file on the top left corner and here is this option of new workflow if you just click on it a new workflow would be created or you can use the keyboard shortcut of control n to create a new workflow now once your workflow is created as we know in ultrix there are a number of tools that are supported by it and all the tools are available in the menu bar so the thing that we need to do is actually input the data as you can see we have these menus of different colors that helps us to organize the different tools and separate them from one another so here we need to go to this in and out tab and here we have this input data if you see there is this star sign over this input data which means that it has been also added to the favorites tab if you just go to the favorites tab here is the input data that is present so if you want uh some of your tools that you are frequently using to be added to your favorites that you can also do so that they are available to you in just one menu without having to switch the menus but here we are just going to in and out just drag it and drop this tool over here right now it's location doesn't matter you can essentially place it anywhere in this window then what we are going to do is as you can see as soon as we uh drag this tool over here this left side panel changed a little bit and why it changed it changed to accommodate the changes that are going to happen right now this means we are going to input some data so how can we input this data we are going to control this using this panel okay so first option is connect a file or database so let's just click on this drop down this shows us this data connections um tab on this data connections dialog box from here we need to select files now why are we selecting these files we are selecting this files because we have an excel sheet that is already created and that is what we want to uh import in it so let's just click on select file then you got to select the location so in my case the sheet that i want to import is present in this desktop and it's named as quarter one data dot xlsx that is it is an excel worksheet you can click on open now once you click on open this kind of an excel uh dialog box would be appearing in front of you let us understand this but before understanding it let us let me show you that how the excel file is looking okay so this is the excel sheet that we have available with us actually the whole excel file in this whole excel file we have three sheets uh november 2021 december 2021 and jan 2022 so basically it contains three columns all of these sheets contains three or four columns in jan 2022 we have three columns which is date product and the quantity in december 2021 we have four columns date product quantity and the total number of sales and in november we have date product quantity and the number of the items that were returned okay so this is the excel sheet now one thing you must remember if you are working with ultrex that whatever file you are going to import in ultrix first you have to close that file i want to import this particular excel file into alteryx so i need to just close it so that it could work in alteryx so let me just close this file uh let me just delete this tool over here and simple delete keyword work over here again let's just drag and drop this tool over here and then we can just connect a filo database once again by clicking on this drop down going to files select file and this time this quarter one data dot excel file now here we have as you can see we had three sheets available that is december 2021 jan 2022 and november 2021 so if you want to just import only a single sheet you can just select the sheet from here if you don't want to import the whole sheet you just want a range of cells that you can select from here or if you want a named range now what is the named range in case of excel if the named range is available so what would happen is like there is a table you can name a table that would be a named range so if that named range is available into your sheet this option would be enabled and then you can just select the named range that you want to import instead of the whole sheet okay or if you want to import the list of sheet names that uh it would only get you all the sheet names in a list format so i don't want all of this i just want to import the sheet that is the december 2021 sheet this is what i want to import now you can click on ok and once you click on ok you can see the left panel has again changed and this time we are getting a lot more information first of all on this bottom panel you can see the records are being shown since our sheet was small the number of records were less around six to seven records were there so all the records are being shown over here but if your data set is huge then only the first 100 records will be shown in this preview tab as you can see the message is written here preview first hundred record so only the first hundred records would be shown now if you want to make any changes over here this is the configuration panel that would allow you to make the changes right like you can set the record limit suppose there are seven records but i don't want all seven i just want the five records to be shown i can simply type here five but as you can see there is no change so how can we uh incorporate this change either we can click on this refresh button so only the five records would be visible or what we can do is if you want to use this output panel so what is this output panel this is an output panel that actually would import or show you the changes that would occur once you have made any changes into the tool right so we can just use this run button or the shortcut ctrl r to incorporate this output panel and as you can see once you click on the run button this dialog box would appear that would tell you that how much time this whole query this whole process took into um consideration that is point zero four seconds so let's just click on okay and now you can see the five records have been displayed you would get plenty of information in this output panel as well like how many fields are there so there are four fields and all the fields of this are being shown okay uh if you click on this drop down you would be able to change these fields if you want like uh all these fields are available let me just like all these fields that's checked right now suppose i don't want to get uh the date i just want all these things okay these three things so only these three things are visible and here we are getting information that three out of four fields are being shown you can just hide all fields or click on this tick sign to show all the fields okay then we have the format that is being displayed which is the cell viewer format if you want to get the information about the particular cell that you can't get like what is the name of the column what is its type what is its size where is the source file etc so all of this we are getting in the cell viewer information how many recalls are displayed over here this is also being shown so this is the data that we are getting next option is a metadata option so if you click on this metadata you would be getting information about the data like the sell viewer option that we just selected this is all available over here the name of the column its type its size and its source if the description you have added any description that would also be shown in this metadata let's just go to data because that's what we are going to work upon so this is about the output panel and the uh records or the information that it displays now let's head back to this left panel that is the configuration panel in this you can see the file format is excel if you want to change any of the file formats you can just select from these these are all supported by ultrix now we have output file name as field now what is this thing suppose you are importing multiple files in one go okay and you want to know that which field belongs to which file so you can use this particular option like right now it said to know let's just select file name only now if you just click on run remember one thing once you have made any change you have to click on run you will see that it would give you the name of the file or the excel file from where you have taken this data right so this is actually how the excel file is imported in ultrix it is a pretty simple process and as you can see it's very easy and gives you so much information about the data so in this video we are going to see two things first of all we are going to see that how can we save an altrix file or an eltrix workflow to be more precise next we are going to see that how can we import multiple files into ultrix okay so first of all let's see how can we save a workflow this is the workflow from our previous video it says that we have created so how do we save it we can just go to file there is this option to save with a shortcut ctrl s that you can select uh you have to select the path where you want to save so whatever path you want that you can just select so this is this ultrix files folder where i want to save it okay you can give it any name like let me just give it excel one okay and the extension is going to be y yx empty that means it is a workflow file okay then you can click on save once you have saved it you can see the workflow has renamed itself to xl1 dot yxmd okay so that's a pretty simple process of saving now what we can do is create a new workflow from here and just close this workflow so the new workflow that we have created is now going to help us import multiple files so first of all let's take a look at the files that we want to import okay okay so we have this folder called csv in which we have two csv files data 2021 and data 2022 okay uh oh sorry data 2020. so what is the csv file csv stands for comma separated values in which all the records are separated by commas and are placed one beside the other so if you just open it with the help of a notepad you can see this is how this file is looking the names of the column is series reference period data value suppressed status units magnitude etc there are columns and then these are all the values of the columns and as you can see they are all separated by commas these are the commas that are going to separate them one from the other okay so this is the csv files that we have the name of the folder is csv it is present in the desktop and the two files is data 2021 and data 2020 okay so the common thing between them is the word data and the first two characters of the year that is 20 okay or actually the first three characters okay so let's see how can we work with it on ultrix so let's just bring our workflow let's just input the data so this is the tool drop it over here now what we are going to do is just click on this drop down the process of importing the file is going to be same okay let's just click on files select a file and here this is the csv folder and now if you want you can just select any of the file that you want to import okay so this is this status 2021 let's click on open now what would happen is uh the first 100 records would be shown to you if you just click on run this workflow then in the case of the output um you will get the time it takes to execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you would see how many columns are there there are a total of 14 columns and 5 000 records are being displayed now why the 5000 records are being displayed there are a total of around 20 000 records okay so in the case of a huge data set we get only few records to be displayed in this output panel why is it because in the output panel the maximum allowed limit is 1 mb so how many records you can get in 1 mb only those records would be displayed right like in this case we have thousand one hundred and two records out of the total number now uh these are sufficient to get you an idea of the fact that uh how the things are gonna work so it's okay but here in this case what we are getting is only the records of the table uh of the sheet that is data 2021 we are not getting 2020s data right so how can we get multiple files how can we like import multiple files into alteryx right so for this we are going to use something known as the wildcard characters now there are multiple white card characters that are available but here we are going to use the asterix file card character and how are we going to use it here you can see uh when we import a file you get the path of that particular file okay so what i'm gonna do is just remove this thing and as we saw that the common ground was data space 20 20 or 22 so the last digit was different just the two files rest of the name was same right so what we are going to do is after data i'm just going to put an asterisk and click on enter or click on refresh now once i do that all the data files over here are being uh you know imported so let's just wait for a few seconds right you just click on this you would get the file over here the link that would be was shown to you so here what we have done is actually i have reduced the number of records in both the files and why i have done this uh this step is done to uh just show you that how these two files are actually taken together okay so let's see how it is happening right now what we are getting over here is two warnings it is fairly normal it's just because the number of records were uh or the number of feets are different for different records okay so if you just click on this output column uh we are going uh getting total 13 records that are being displayed okay now these 13 records are actually from a combination of both the files that is 2021 and 2022 or 2021 or 2020 okay now how do we verify this in order to verify this we are going to use this fourth field that is output file name as field right now it's selected to know that means we do not know which records belongs to which file but if we just select it to file name only and click on run for the workflow then we would be getting this dialog box let's just click on ok and we just click on this output panel then you can see the number of fields has changed to 15 and here is this file name field where we are getting 20 21 data and 2022 data okay so uh here you can see the first six records are from 2021 data and the remaining seven records are from 2022 data a combination of total 13 records is being shown over here that means there are a total of 13 records that are being displayed to us okay now let's just see what all uh things we can do over here and that is like just keep it to file name only here we have some information like the delimiters information so what is the delimiter like in comma separated values the different values are separated by a comma so that means comma is a delimiter it separates the values right so comma is taken as a delimiter if you have uh like a json file or an html file then of course comma would not be the delimiter the delimiter would be different so whatever character you want as a delimiter that you can use over here next we have first row contains field names so in order to understand this let me just open the csv file in notepad once okay so here is the csv file that i have opened in notepad this is the first series of commas that we are getting and this is actually the column names so this is the first field that is series reference period data value suppressed etc this is all taken as the field name so this first option that we have let me just close this file this first option that we have first row contains field names if it is checked then the first row is selected as the field names if you just uncheck it and run it once again then what would happen is let's click on ok show the output you can see field two field three field four like this all the field names had been shown to us and the first comma separated values that we had would be taken as a record itself right so which is of course not correct so let me just rectify it by again running it by checking that particular option okay uh next we have all these information which is actually not that important but it is there to you know just um give you much more information about the data one thing is ignore delimiters and quotes so suppose we have some values uh into our data which actually includes the comma like apple comma banana which are not two separate values so to tell the computer this thing what we can do is actually include it in quotes and that would be ignored as a delimiter so if you want to ignore anything as a delimiter that you can do okay so this is all about the multiple files there is one more thing that we need to know and that is suppose we make some changes into the folder let me just go to the csv folder and let me just copy this file and paste it so suppose there is a change in the folder let me just rename it to 2020 underscore data okay now what happens if i have added another file or if i remove some files okay we can just click on run and now if we just click on this output you can see the total number of records displayed is 20. so this whole process is now automatic if any changes are being made into your data or into the folder in the files that would be reflected automatically in altrix that's the beauty of this in this video we are going to talk about the data types that are supported in ultrix so as we know that alteryx is a selfservice data analytics tool it makes the process of etl easier and it is a super tool that combines the functionalities that are required for the steps of data preparation geospatial analysis and data science mainly to support all these functionalities alteryx uses these five data types these are the five data types that are supported in ultrix which are string data numeric data date and time data boolean data and spatial objects once the data is brought into ultrix the alteryx data type is applied to the entire column and each value within that column ultrex tends to use the best suitable data type for the data coming from the databases or the structured files such as excel within the alteryx table now let us look at all of these data types in detail one by one so first of all we come to the string data type string data represents only text even if the data is numeric or spaces or special characters if a string consists of numbers it is ideally advised uh to first convert it to the numeric data type then you can just perform the calculations into it the string data is the one that is kept as it is it is further divided into these four categories that is string v string w string and v underscore string string and w string are a fixed length and you have to set the predefined length of the string so suppose you have set 8 to 100 characters then every time it would take 100 characters the w string can hold more international characters now we have v string and we underscore w string it stands for variable the v here stands for variable that means we cannot set any predefined length or we should not send any predefined length and it adjusts itself according to the length of the text of of the value that it is going to hold next we have is the numeric data type numeric alteryx data types um are the ones that contains only the numbers it stores the numbers that could be represented by either a single lizard or by multiple digits as well we have different combinations in this like byte integer fixed decimal float and double byte and integer are the whole numbers fixed decimal float and double include a decimal number as well byte is a small number then we have integer which has more significant numbers as you can see they range as well in the examples then we have fixed decimal which is used for currency and float and double so this is fixed sml which is used as a currency that's a numeric value with a decimal next we have the float and double which are used for most precise numbers float and code are not good because it comes to comparison they are never equal float is generally used to save the memory now the next data type we have is the date time data type uh in altrix the format of date time and date and time combined together are fixed so you will need to do some manipulation on your data if it is not in the format that you need as generalized by ultrix sometimes it is very difficult to work with date and time there is a tool known as the datetime macro that converts the date and time in human readable as well as ultrix readable format so the format is as you can see for the date there is a 10 character string employing four characters for year two for month and two for date this is the general format that is supported by ultrix then we have time which is again an eight character string two characters for r2 for minutes and two for seconds and the examples have been shown on the right side of the screen next we have date and time combined which is a 19 character string employing four characters for the year two for the month two for the date and two each for the hours minutes and seconds and an example has been shown on the right side so these are the date and time data types that are supported in ultrix next we have is the boolean data type so the boolean basically represents a flag and it has only two possible values that is true and false so true means nonzero or one and false means zero or basically any other digit that is not zero can be considered as true boolean is used to basically characterize the objects categorize them into various categories or identify them whether the objects are a part of the particular category or not for example let's take up a student data set so in the student data set we can check that if the student has passed the test or not so we can just create or the data can have a column as passed it could have values true false or yes no so true false in that case would be represented using the boolean data types next we have is the spatial objects spatial objects are used for mapping and are associated with maintaining the data records a point a line polyline or polygon all comes out of spatial objects which can be used for mapping it is associated with the data record and they can be multiple spatial object fields in a table furthermore if you want to use any of the data like which is which cannot be represented in the format of a text like uh let's suppose an image or a video or an audio file then we use the spatial objects again so what happens is when you just import the uh table or any kind of an excel file then what happens is these spatial objects are automatically invoked actually there are two ways through which this alteryx imports this data types like how it uses these data types so let us take a look at them as well data in alteryx can be brought through these two fields or three through these two tools that is the auto field tool and the select tool now what is the difference between them auto field tool is used to select the data type automatically by alterix while the select tool helps the user to decide the data type so in case you are a user and you don't want an overhead of selecting the data data for alteryx you can just go for the auto field tool so auto field tool is used to read through all of the records of an input and set the field type to the smallest possible size that is relative to the data contained in the column the tool correctly assigns a numeric field to a string data type where any record starts with 0 and not a number so in order to configure the tool we can just go to the select string fields to auto change field type and select the fields to auto configure them we can use either individually or all the fields at once as well next we have is the select tool so the select tool is used to include exclude and reorder the columns of data that pass through your workflow excluding the columns that can limit the data passing through a workflow and improve performance we can also use the select tool to modify the type and size of the data rename a column or add a description to it now there are other tools that include the select tool functionality such are append fields tool fine nearest tool join tool join multiple tool selecting db tool and spatial match tool we can use the table to modify the incoming data stream each row in the table represents a column in the data the field column in the table identifies the name of the column in the data and auto sizes to fit the column names without cutting of any text which is taken up to 40 characters so this is how the autofill tool and the select tool works in itrex now as we know that there are multiple tools in ultrix and each of them have a specific functionality in case you are interested in learning more about these tools then what you can do is refer to the official alteryx documentation now how to access it let me show you so in order to access it first of all i have opened up google and all you need to do is google alteryx help so once you uh google it the first link that comes up is the home page instead of going to the home page you can select on this documentation link so what would happen is the whole alteryx health documentation would be open in front of you now in case you want to learn about anything related to alteryx you can refer to this documentation which is very much precise and clean in case you want to learn about these tools specific tools then you can refer to this um menu over here where all the tools are present and they are configured or they are grouped together like all these tools that are present in the in out tab are together grouped in this in out the tools that are present in the preparation tab are all present over here you can click on any of these links and that link would be opened here you would find the way through which you can use the tools how to use it how is it looking and how you can configure it then uh you can also see some examples that what would happen when this tool is being used what kind of output you would be think so uh these are the documentation that would help you to learn about all the tools in alteryx but the common ones that are used and the most important ones we would be covering in this course in this video we are going to start discussing about the important tools in ultrix the tools that would help you carry out the different tasks that are really important throughout your atrix journey so uh without any further ado let us start with this video first of all before jumping into the tools part let us download the data set now this data set that we are going to download is going to be used throughout this course so it is important for you to have a copy of this data set for you as well so how do we download this uh first of all what you need to do is simply google sample superstore data set like i have googled over here now once you do that the first link that would come up would be a tableau community so let's just click on this link and this is actually a data set that has the different types of information like the five data types of alteryx that we have just learned are all supported in this particular data set it has around 10 000 records so it is easier for you to understand the concepts and practice it on this kind of a data set it is available for free so you can use it as many times as you want now once this link is open here you can see this is an excel file you can just simply click on download and store it into the location that you want so since i have already downloaded it over here sample superstore.xlx as you can see so i'm not going to redownload it but you can just save it now once you have downloaded the data set let's come back to our ultrix tool here today i am going to discuss about the browse tool in ultrix now the browse tool is a really important tool and here i have actually implemented the browse tool but what i am going to do is just delete all of this functionality and show you once again that how it is working okay so first of all let's understand what is a browse tool as you can see uh we have in this favorites tab the browse tool is available but if you check the in out tab that's where the browse tool would be present okay so the browse tool is used to view the data from a connected tool what do you mean by a connected tool that means the browse tool if you just bring it over here like this then it won't be able to show you some data it needs some kind of a tool so browse tool is actually a connected tool okay so we can see the data profile for multiple columns at once in a single holistic view or for a single column of the data we can see the information on data type the number of records the quality of the data and a variety of other statistics as well using the browse tool in case of a spatial report or a behavioral data analysis the type is connected an additional tab is available in the browse tool that shows the preview of the actual object on a map or a report okay so browse rule if you just bring it up let's understand this this thing that's green over here is known as an anchor it has one anchor that is the input anchor now if you just bring up this input data tool which we have already used you can see it also has one anchor but it has in the shape of the anchor of the browse tool and the input tool is different so the input tool has an output anchor that means the input tool contains the data and it gives its data to some other tool browse tool on the other hand cannot exist independently it needs some other tool to exist that's why it takes the data from some other tool and to take the data from some other tool it needs an anchor that's why to use the browse tool at least the input tool should be present so that it acts as an input anchor and this acts as a receiving anchor for itself okay so let us now see how can we uh use the data or use the browse tool to show the data the data profile okay so first of all uh we have this input tool using this input tool what i'm gonna do is actually import a file into ultrix okay the sample superstore data set file that we have just downloaded that is the file that i'm going to import so let's go to file and select file here is the sample superstore file let us open it now it asks for a sheet so the order sheet is what i'm going to go with let's just click on ok so after a few seconds you can see that here in the configuration panel we have this whole data set right now only a hundred rows are being shown over here if we just run this workflow then we would be able to see it in the output column but the output would not be shown over here right now and these kind of errors would be opening why because of the browse tool we have used the browse tool but not actually provided a connection to it so let's see how do we work with it how do we uh you know work around it okay so let's just first close this message now what we are going to do is connect these two anchors like this drag from the input anchor and drop it to the browse tool anchor right now it's going to take a few seconds and again if we just run the workflow then it's going to take a few seconds and then the information will be shown you can see the percentage of the work that's been done and once all the work has been done you would get this kind of a message let's click on ok now the information being shown in the configuration panel is with relevant to the input data tool if we just click on the browse tool then right now nothing is being shown because we have not selected any of the records right if you remember i just told you that uh you have to select at least one column or you can select multiple columns as well uh so that the information is being shown to you okay so let us just select some column or let's say the category column if we just select this category column from here then wait for a few seconds and the information or the report of the category column or the data profile of the category column would be shown in this configuration panel okay so this is the data profile of the category column that has been shown over here just a second yeah so um we just select the category column here it is being shown and as you can see the data type first it has taken is the variable string so that means the uh length is variable to just save the memory space the total number of records the size that has been taken is 255 bytes okay now out of the total 909 994 records the total records that are okay is all the records are okay here you can see the number of records that are okay and the percentage so 100 records are okay unique means how many different values are there so as you can see we are getting three over here that means the three possible values for category are furniture office supplies and technology that has been shown over here then we have some of the statistics of the length so the minimum length of the value is nine as you can see it should be furniture then the maximum is 15 which is for office space supplies then uh we have the shortest value which is furniture of course longest value is office underscore supplies then uh we have the first alphanumeric value that is the first value that you are getting is furniture and the last record must be having the category as office supplies right as technology there are no blanks that means the particular column is clean it has no inconsistent data there is no leading white space and there is no trailing white space now there is another reason of choosing this particular data set because this is a clean data set it does not have any of the inconsistencies so for us as a beginner it's easier to understand and work with these kind of data sets okay then we have the frequent values so it would tell you that how many um instances of the particular category are there if we talk about office supplies so there are six thousand uh 26 records of the office supplies that is the most number of records for this then we have furniture about 2121 records and technology with 1.8 k records so this is the data profile of the particular column that has been shown over here as you can see the column is uh taken over here as category if we just try to employ sub category as well over here so this is the sub category that we have employed over here right now and now the summary has changed as you can see the number of unique values is 17 now so there are 17 subcategories and here is the uh introduction of the individual sub categories the frequent values the graph that is being shown over here there are 12 more values you can expand it and see that what is the occurrence of each of these subcategories okay next we have is the country so the country if you just select on this country column it's all united states right now so i don't think it's going to make any difference then we have the cities which has 531 unique values for the cities and how it has been shown so this is the usage of the browse tool through which it is used to show the different records okay now in order to view multiple values what we can do is actually use the left right view or the top bottom view right now subcategory is being selected in this profile but in this profile nothing is being selected as you scroll down you can see that the different columns are being shown over here so suppose i want to show the segment i can just click on segment and the values or the data profile or segment would be shown over here so here you can see the segment it has three unique values consumer home office are the two values and the third value as you can see is the corporate segment so the data profile of two columns are being shown over here using the browse tools simultaneously so that's all about the browse tool that you need to know in this video we are going to talk about data manipulation and output tool in ultrix so as we know that alteryx is a tool that is used for the purposes of data cleaning as well right so what we are going to do today is actually i am going to show you how to clean the data if inconsistencies are present using the data manipulation tool in ultrix okay so this is the sample superstore data set that we downloaded and as i have already told you that it is a super clean data set there are no inconsistencies in this data set so what i have done is i have introduced an inconsistency and that is in this furniture what i have done is i have actually added some leading white spaces in this category furniture i have added some leading white spaces now let us add some more in the subcategory field okay so there is this chairs i am just going to replace the stairs value and introduce some leading white spaces so around three white spaces would be good and replace all the values of okay so 791 replacements were made and this is the change that i have done to introduce some inconsistencies into our data set and to see that how can we solve it using ultrax now using control s let me just save this excel file and close this excel file right so let's create a new workflow new workflow 3 over here and uh just import this data set so let's just use this input data and what we're going to do is connect it to a file so this is the data set that we have and the orders sheet click on okay so now um as you can see there is nothing that's been shown over here let's just add a browse tool now there is another way through adding a browse tool that's you can just right click over here and there is this option add browse after and the shortcut for the same as ctrl shift b so you can just add it and click on run now once you do that what would happen is uh you would get this kind of a message and of course the records would be shown over here okay so the profiles have been shown over here now the changes we made were in the category okay so let's just see the category and the subcategory right now the changes were made in the category and the subcategory fields now if you just hover over this category field there are few records that are not okay right the red line has been shown over here and um that is around 21.22 records that are not okay in the category field because the inconsistency is there similarly in the sub category field as well there is 6.17 records uh 6.17 records that are not okay represented by red so if you just show the category over here and just split the view so over here we had been shown the category field and here let's just go with the subcategory field so here is the subcategory field okay so now what we get first of all let's take a look at the category field that is uh 7 000 some records are okay but 2121 reports are not okay now what is the reason uh that these records are not okay these are the values with leading white space how many values 2121 values okay similarly if we just talk about the sub category over here so we have 617 records that are not okay represented in the red color and what is the issue the issue is the values with the leading white space so these are some of the inconsistencies that would be shown into your data profile only okay so how do we uh just get rid of these inconsistencies right so what you need to do is search for that particular column over here here as well you can see that the mark of not okay is being shown over here represented by red and the rest is green in category and subcategory fields okay in the output pane and the values that are inconsistent have been marked as red and the message is the cell has leading spaces the cell has leading spaces so whatever the inconsistency is it's been automatically shown to you by ultrix now how do we manipulate it how do we clean it you need to select the column which has inconsistency click on these three dots here we have the option of data cleanse so you can just go to this data cleanse option just a second and here we have remove unwanted characters and in the remove unwanted characters the first option is leading slash trailing white space so that means any of the uh leading or the trailing white spaces if there would be removed so just select that option and click on apply now it's going to take a few seconds and the changes would be applied now once the changes have been applied you can see the red mark in the category has gone from here we can see them all correctly the furniture leading spaces have been removed if you want to cross check it let's just bring up the category field once again here so if you see right now okay is change to a hundred percent similarly we can do the same thing for the sub category field as well we can go to subcategory data cleanse remove unwanted characters leading trailing white space and click on apply now again it's going to take a few seconds and the changes would be applied in order to crosstrick it you can just go to the subcategory option over here and the okay has been changed to 100 now again run the workflow so if you again run the workflow the inconsistencies would be uh introduced once again and why is that because now what we are getting is we are again getting the data from input that means alterix only makes changes into the format of the data that is brought in front of it not only original files okay so that's why uh using the browse tool the changes that have been made are only made onto this data that has been used in ultrix right now once we have changed the data what we need to do is actually make use of this data right so what i'm going to do is output this data into an excel file but not on to a single sheet into multiple sheets so how do we do that for this we use the output data tool of this in out category so output data tool let's just bring it up now what i'm going to do with this output data tool is i'm going to select the category as the criteria so what i'm going to do or what i'm planning to do is actually use this category over here to output the data right or basically use a segment to output the data uh so what would happen is all the data uh all three uh separate sheets would be created right so uh if we just apply this segment if you just take a look at the segment field just a second okay so now if we take a look at this segment then what we are getting is that there are three unique values so that means three different sheets would be created in the excel file so for this what we need to do is go to this output tool uh click on this arrow here and go to files and select file so basically we are selecting the location where our file needs to be saved now provide a name for the file let's say output excel okay and make sure that in the save as type it is selected as uh an excel file or a microsoft excel for the extension xls or xlsx because then only you would be able to create multiple sheets in case you decide to save it as an alterex database so multiple sheets in that case is not possible okay click on save now uh it would ask you to specify the name of a sheet we can just go with sheet1 and click on ok great now what would happen is if we just click on this tool here we have this configuration panel in this you need to just check this option that is take file slash table name from field then there is this drop down from this drop down you have to select the third option which is change file slash table name now what would happen is this would allow you to select the column on the basis of which you want to create different sheets right so uh here we can just use the drop down to select the value and that is the segment so you can just select the segment once you have done all the steps then you need to use this control r or run button to just run the workflow then you can see that the dialog box would be there showing the time taken and if you just click on this messages or that is this three hamburger menu over here you will see that these three sheets were created consumer corporate and the home office sheets and the number of records that were written into each of these sheets to cross check what you can do is go to that particular folder which was present in my desktop here output excel the excel sheet that has been created and you can see that there are three sheets that are available the consumer sheet the corporate sheet and the home office sheet now each of these sheets has their data that is split according to their segments all the home office data in this sheet all the corporate data in this sheet and all the consumer data in this sheet so this is how the output tool in ultrix works the output data tool is used to output the multiple excel sheets in this video we are going to take a look at the few tools of this in out configuration so the first tool that we are going to look at is the directory tool so the directory tool is used to return a list of all the files that are present in the specified directory it returns the file name and other information about each file uh like its size the date it was created the last modified date and many more information okay so let's see how do we use it uh first of all grab the directory tool from the you know tab into your workflow workspace then what you need to do is in this configuration tab you have to specify the directory of the folder from where you want to get the files okay so in my case i have already specified the folder that is this files folder in the altrix click on ok now if you want specific files to be there only then you can specify the files otherwise uh this asterisk is over here that means uh any of the files any of the file names dot any of the file extensions would be taken if you want to um include the sub directories like if you want to search for the specified file types in directories that are specified within the specified directory then this box um is checked otherwise leave it unchecked okay it's only for the specific files but we are going for the generic ones so no need to include the sub directories let's just click on run so what would happen is uh you would get this kind of an output that is the list of all of these uh files that are present in this directory the full path the directory the name of the file along with its extension the creation time the time when it was last accessed last written the size and some of the attributes like it is it encrypted is it compressed is it archived is it hidden is it normal uh is it offline is it readonly uh and so on so these are all the fields that we would be getting so this is for the generic files let us now search for the specific files okay so we are going with the extension as you can see yx md files are present over here so instead of all the files my xmd files are the only ones that i am interested in right now and in the sub directories as well then click on run so what i would be getting is only the yxmd file so there are a total of seven yx md files in the sub directories and the directory of this particular folder so this is what i am getting through the directory tool right let's just click ctrl s to save it next tool that we have is the date time tool so as we have discussed about the date time already uh in the data types video in ultrix so this date time now tool is used to return a single record that is the date or the time at the time when the workflow was run and you can just convert the value into the string format of your choosing so basically this is useful that once you are creating any report and you want to show the date or the time of its creation then you can use this particular tool okay so let's just bring in this tool this is the daytime now tool over here it requires us to specify two things the language in which we want the date and time and the format in which we want that is the output format so let's just get the format like this where i'm getting the date as well as the time now click on run or use the shortcut ctrl r so we would be getting a column with today's date and the time at which this was run okay now in case you decide to change the language right now i have taken english but let me just go with spanish okay click on ok and now what we are getting is the same output but to get a different output let's just choose a different format like this click on run and now what we are getting is a different format like the month name is in spanish right now so this is what we are getting this is the usage of the um date time now tool let's just press ctrl s to save it and move on to the next tool which is the text input tool now what is the usage of this text input tool it is used to manually enter the text to create small data files for input it can be useful in like testing and creating the lookup tables while we are building the workflow the data input from the text input tool saves within the workflow so you can share the workflow without having to provide an input file okay so let's see how do we work with it uh first of all let's just get this input data that is this text input tool over here now once we have got it over here we would be getting these different options like this is the option to import if you want to import any of the files but treat it as the input that has been manually taken into the workflow so when we share the workflow the file gets shared as well we do not have to externally share the file right then we have the copy once we have entered the values if you want to copy it if you have already copied the values from somewhere and just want to paste it over here that's this paste option you can use the delete and the insert options are there as well so delete is to delete any of the data that's existing and insert to insert the columns so let's just insert a row first of all so this is the row that's been inserted if you just double click over here you can start adding the values so what i'm going to add is name let's say sameer then i'm going to add a value let's say 12 and then i'm going to add a city let's say delhi okay so this is my first value that i have entered read similarly i can add another value let's say a name a value and a city so mumbai okay so this is how i can keep on adding the records manually uh these are the field names right now taken as field one field two and field three but if you want you can change them as well by double clicking on them so the first field name is going to be name the second one is going to be age and the third one is going to be city okay so this is the record that i have got if i just click on run then what would be i getting is this uh hold record in the form of a table like this now let's just see how the import function works so let's just click on import this is the sheet excel sheet that i want to import this is the one that we just exported uh in the form of an excel file so the consumer one is what i'm going to import so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this tool so that's where the whole sheet was not imported but i'm happy with it let's just click on run now once we do that this whole table is actually a part of this tool this input tool okay a text input tool now this means there is no external file being associated with this if you just delete the excel file then also there would be no change in altrix because altrix has created a copy using the text input tool of this particular dataset right so this is uh the importance of the text input tool over the normal input data tool that we were using up till now but there is an added disadvantage as well because in this case alteryx create another memory of itself to store this data so there would be an additional memory requirement so it depends upon you and the requirement of the particular workflow that whether you want to use the text input tool or the input data tool okay now let's uh save it yeah in case you want to delete it suppose i just don't want this order id column so delete the columns so you can just select the column and delete it if you want to select uh delete a particular row like i want to delete this row number six delete row so the row number six has been deleted okay so this is how the things work in the text input tool you can actually make changes into the data set as well without affecting the original excel file you can copy it and if i just open up my notepad i would be able to paste it as well like six was selected so this has been copied you want to select multiple records like this and copy them then go to notepad and paste them so you would be able to create a copy for them uh for yourself as well okay let's just remove it right now so that's about the text input tool that you need to know now let us talk about the map input tool which is the final tool in this particular group so what is the map input tool as you can see the name itself is suggesting it is used to draw or select the desired map object to use as an input in a workflow you can either draw or select a point line or polygon to form a map that displays a reference base map okay so let's just get this tool map input tool over here and as soon as we get there uh there would be a map you can just select the base map right now it's selected to none let's just select ultra stock so you'd be getting a map you can hover over it uh to just you know load any of the countries or the continents that you like so i'm just going to go all the way to india using the zoom buttons you can zoom in or zoom out and get a location let's say kanpur and here i want to point to kanpur so uh right now as you can see the mode has been set to draw so i can draw anything so we can just get a point to draw it on kanpur over here and if you want to provide it a name so let me just provide it a name as home click on save and that's it you can click on run to run the workflow so what will it do is it will create this kind of a value for you the label is home and the spatial object is point view browse tool map tab so the spatial object has been created using the map input tool hello everyone welcome back to the altrix tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a few tools from the preparation tab in ultrix so first of all we have discussed the tools of the inout tab that means the tools that would be handy when we are importing the data or exporting it now once we have imported the data we may need to perform some manipulations over the data so we would be looking at the tools that would help us to do the exact same thing the preparation tools okay so first tool that we are going to look for is the auto field tool the auto field tool we have already discussed in the data types video that it is used to read through all of the records of an input and set the field type to the smallest possible size that is related to the data contained in the column so what we are going to do is in this particular video see the practical application of the auto field tool so first of all what i have done is i have already input the data using the uh input data tool so because this is the step that we have done multiple times till now so we do not need to again see it next i have cleansed this data like in the subcategory there were some of the trailing white spaces so i have cleaned it and let me just show you how to clean it real quick the use of this data cleansing tool so let me just remove this tool once from here now how can you clean the data is you can just bring in the data cleansing tool or what you can do is wait for um alteryx to automatically bring it in okay so let's see how to do that so first of all uh you have inputted the data then you need to just search for the inconsistent blocks that is the subcategory go on to these three dots click on data cleanse remove unwanted characters leading slash trailing white space click on apply now once the changes have been applied click on this green tick icon that's okay so now the changes would be applied and you would see the data cleansing tool has been brought in automatically okay now its configuration panel is also present there which you can use to further clean the values but uh now our data is clean so we won't be using it anymore right the next thing we are going to do is use the auto field tool so let's just bring in the auto field tool over here now if you see the data preparation tools all have two anchors the input anchor and the output angle the input anchor is used to take the input data and the output anchor is used to present it further okay so this is the autofill tool as soon as i brought it up there is this configuration panel now here i can select the values through which you want to change the field type okay let's just clear all the values and select only category subcategory and segment from here now once we have selected these fields click on run now what will it do is it would show us the message box that's okay now let's just see the messages that um would actually tell us what changes it had made so uh the field type of segment has been changed to string for eight characters field type of category change to string or 15 characters and that of category to string of 11 characters so this is uh what the change is made by the auto field tool the the changes that it has made in these three fields has been shown to us in case we select all these fields let's select all and click on run for the auto field tool so what we would be getting is this again go to the messages so we would be getting that what fields it has changed to the all these records okay so you can see some of them have been changed to string some of them to variable string and so on like this it has made the changes automatically so this is the use of the auto field tool and the data cleansing tool in the preparation tab now uh let's just save this using ctrl s and move on to the next tool that is the filter tool so filter tool as the name suggests is used to select the data based upon a particular condition uh the rows of the data that made the condition are output to the uh screen in the form of a true anchor and those that do not meet the criteria are output in the form of a false anchor so if we just bring up this filter tool over here you can see it has three anchors the input anchor and in the output it has two anchors the true anchor and the false anchor so we specify a base condition and if the data meets the base condition then it goes into the true anchor otherwise it goes into the false anchor okay so let's see with the example let's click on this filter tool over here so this kind of a configuration box would be there now there are two kinds of filters that we can apply the basic filter or the custom filter in the case of the basic filter we can specify the basic information like if the um criteria is being matched or not if you want to apply some complex operations then we use the custom filters custom filters allow us to add functionalities to add mathematical functions the boolean values the if else statements and many more things which we would be of course seeing one by one but first of all let's take a look at the basic filter so if you remember uh we had a column called category in this we had some categories like the furniture technology and the office of place so what i'm going to do is i'm going to assign the furnitures separately that means all the categories where furniture is the category it would be assigned to a true value right so from the basic filter let's just select the column the column name is going to be the category column and equals let's just type in the value furniture okay now once you have typed it you can just click on run to run the workflow and then you would see that okay we have two anchors the true anchor if you just hover over it it would give you the category furniture and then we have is the false anchor for the category furniture okay now here are all the records that are being displayed in the output panel for the true value here you can see this is the true value being shown there are a 1113 records that belong to the category furniture okay so if you hover over it the category here is furniture only furniture all the way furniture but if you go to the false value then what we have is the category technology and office applies great let's just add another filter anchor over here into the false part where what we would be doing is adding another base filter on the basis of the category let's just select the category again and it must be equal to technology technology over here okay click on run and here so now we again have these true false values for this so in the true there would be the technology values and in the false there would be the office applies values so this is how we have used the basic filter tool to actually create three separate uh values for these like the furniture categories are separate the technology is separate and the office supplies is now separate and we separate records okay so this is how the basic uh filter is being used now what i'm going to do is just i'm going to copy these two fields or these two tools that is the input tool and the data cleansing tool into a new workflow and show you the demonstration of the filter tool for the custom filter okay so let's just bring in our tool over here connect it and here let's select a custom filter right so here is the effects which you can use to apply any of these conditions or any of these functions like you want to convert it right or you want to perform any kind of a manipulation over here you want to apply any of the conditional statements if you want to allow any date time uh applications any of the file applications that you can do over here like the string functions so let's just use the count words so i basically needed to count the words okay and then from this x you can just select the existing columns so i want it to select the count words for the city click on run and then uh it's going to give you the values for of course there won't be any false values right now because there could not be any false values for the count function and it would give you the count of the characters of the cities right or basically what we can do is actually use any kind of a basic filter like let's say if the profit is greater than equal to one so that would be a profit right so we have written a basic filter query but if you want to see how it is looking in the custom filter there you can apply it profit is greater than equal to one now if you just run it what you would be getting is in the two values the true and the false values so that means the records where we are getting a profit and the records where we are getting a loss in the case of the true are the ones where we are getting a profit here you can see all of these values we are getting a profit but in these values we are getting a loss you can see this is a loss okay so you just go to the messages um you would get that in the 4008 records there were the true values that means there is where we are getting a profit and the remaining 1183 values written false that means these are the values where we are getting a loss so this is the usage of the filter tool in altrix and this is how we use it so that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome back to the altrix tutorials in this video we are going to discuss about some more uh tools that are present in the data preparation group in excel uh in ultrix so the first tool that we are going to look in this is the formula tool so the formula tool is actually used to create new columns uh update the columns or use the expressions to perform a variety of the calculations on the already existing values that are present in the columns okay so we can use it to apply conditional statements convert uh the data type from one to another format the dates extract file paths apply algorithms clean the data apply the validations or perform the tests etc okay so let us see how are we going to use this formula tool so right now i have got the same data set that is the consumer sheet from the sample store data set okay and i have cleansed it that is removed the inconsistencies now let's just bring up our formula tool to here and in this what i'm going to do is uh in the configuration panel i have two options either i can just select a column and that data would be overwritten or i can add a new column so what i'm going to do is i'm actually i'm going to add a new column so add a column and then you go to specify the name of the column so that's going to be profit slash loss okay and here what i'm going to do is apply a conditional statement that uh this conditional statement if the value of the profit so for getting the column names we can simply just use a square bracket so we have the profit value over here if the profit value is greater than equals to 0 then the value in this column is going to be profit else it is going to be loss okay like this and whatever the tax for value you want you need to just write it in the single quotes okay so the size we can just specify over here it's going to be the data type we can check is going to be the variable string and click on run now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6 seconds to be precise and as you can see uh we should be getting a new column over here and here on the very last uh you can see the column profit and loss if the values are positive then we are getting the value profit if it is negative then we are getting the value loss okay uh so here is a warning in the profit that the there was a large value over here but it has been rounded up by alteryx for clarity okay so that's why the red uh is being shown over here the rate mark has been shown over here so this is one way of using the formula tool right um just like this you can actually make changes into the existing data like um right now if you just don't want to add an extra column so we want to apply another formula and the thing is that i want to get the profit and the loss the same thing but in this column only that is the value that is showing me profit in that value only i want this to happen so i can just select the column and here i'm just going to select the profit column okay now if i just click on run then what would happen is the values in that particular column would be overwritten okay so there is an error uh the thing is that we wanted string value but the field is numeric so that's why it's not happening so let me just change it a little bit that is over here if there is a profit then i want 100 to be written over there else i want 0 to be written over here okay or i can just actually you know uh change its data type as well like it's double so 100 and 0 would be okay let's click on run now if you just go to this output panel and here we have only two values hundred and zero hundred and zero so this is how you can actually update the existing values or create a new column now in case you want to remove any formula you can just go to that formula and here is this delete button you can just delete that and now if you again run it then the changes that were made initially would be overwritten and you would be getting the original values of the profit that were present in the call so this is how we work with the formula tool to either add new columns or update the existing columns right next tool that we are going to talk about is the sample tool so let's just go to the sample tool now what is the sample tool it is used to limit the data stream to a specified number percentage or a random set of rows uh also if you want a selected configuration to the columns so to be applied you can group the columns using the sample tool so let's just get the sample tool over here and as soon as we get it this is the configuration panel that we are getting the first option is the first n rows uh it returns every row in the data from the beginning to the data through the value of n like you can specify a value of n here you can see right now if you just run it so it would return the first hundred rows as you can see first hundred has been shown over here because the value of n was hundred but if we just set it to 10 and then run it so what will it do is it would just show you the first 10 rows okay so you can set the value of n next option is last and rows which of course is used to show us the last n rows the value of n which you can specify as per your wish next is skip first n rows which returns all the rows in the data that start after the specified number of rows next we have one of every n rows that means return the first row of every group of n rows like if i just select n so the whole record would be split into groups of 10 and the first row in each group would be returned to me so if you just run it then we would be able to see the changes like through this row id like 1 then 12 then 26 and 48 this is how the rows are being returned to me okay next is one in chan one in n chance to include each row that means it would return randomly it would randomly determine if each row is included in the sample or not so the random values are being uh returned to me as you can see from the row id itself 11 then 20 then 21 randomly the rows are being returned to me okay so um then we have the first n percent of rows that means it returns the n percent in this case the 10 percent of rows it requires the data to pass through the tool twice like once we calculate the count of rows and then to return the specified percent of rows okay then we can just run it to get the n percent of rows that's the ten percent of the rows or of the total values okay so they were around 5000 uh 191 records so 519 records that's the 10 of the records have been displayed over here okay next we have is the group by option so if you want to group it uh on the basis of some column that you can do let's just group it by category and just get the first 10 rows to be grouped by category we can click on run so this is what we would be getting in the output okay so furniture categories then the office supplies categories and the technology categories have been used to group by the values so this is how the sample tool works for us ah next we have is the sort tool so the sort tool is actually very important and as the name suggests it is used to sort the data so um let's see how it works it actually takes two things into consideration let's just get the sort tool over here it takes two things into consideration the name and the order so basically uh any of the name of the field that you want to sort and in which order you want to sort if in the ascending order of in the descending order okay so let's just uh delete this tool once and let's see how we manually apply it like without using this tool okay so now if we just run this we would be getting our hands on the data set okay yeah so if you want to sort the values like i want to sort it on the basis of the sales so let's just go to the sales column or click on these three dots go to sort and i want to sort it on the basis of the ascending order then click on apply so once we do that we can click on this red this green tick button and you would see that it has been applied if you just click on the output actually run the workflow so here is what we would be getting the sorted values like you can see the value have been sorted on the basis of the sales the ascending order the sort tool has already been applied and the name is taken as sales and the order is taken as ascending so this is the usage of the sort tool that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrix tutorials in this video we are going to see the three most important tools in the data preparation tab of altrics the first tool that we are going to see is the unique tool as the name suggests unique is used to distinguish that whether a data record is unique or if it is duplicate by grouping on one or more specified fields then it sorts those fields so if you want some of the fields to be unique then you can simply check it using this unique tool that whether the particular field or particular column is actually containing unique values or not so how can we use it let's just get this tool uh just like the filter tool we have used the unique tool also has three anchors one is the anchor where it gets the data the next two anchors are the unique and the duplicate anchors as you can see the u and the d so it basically shows you that which of the values are unique and which of them are not okay now this is the configuration panel from where you can just select the values like i would select the customer name i want to check that if the customer is returning to me or not so if i just click on run then okay i'm getting uh some of the unique values so there are 409 records where the customer name is unique so there are 409 unique customers i'm also getting duplicates that means the customers we have are the returning customers and now all of these values are grouped together as a customer name like first you can see aaron bergman so the customer uh whatever purchases the customer has made is being grouped together by his name then by this second customer third customer and so on okay so these are the uni customers the total of 409 customers are there and they're returning to me again and again to purchase a total of 10 000 uh record items okay so this is what the unique tool helps us to understand about the data now uh you have applied it on one field but if you want you can apply it on multiple fields like for the category also i want to apply then click on run now what will happen is uh we would be getting the unique values for uh the combination of both right so now the in the unique value over here the total of 1136 records have been displayed the customer name uh if they have purchased from each of these categories right so in the category there are these three categories furniture office supplies and technology and the customer name as you can see is same for the three and the remaining are the duplicates which means the customer has made another purchase in the same category of the items so this is the usage of the unique tool okay now let's move on to the next tool that is the imputation tool now what is the imputation tool imputation tool is used to replace a specified value within one or more numeric data fields with another specified value so basically it's used that if your data is inconsistent and contain some of the null values then what you can do is actually clean the data set so you can replace the null values with either the average of the values of that particular column or um basically with any value that you want okay so let's just get the imputation tool to get a better look at how it works over here so here you would get the fields which you want to impute now only the numeric fields would be there because that's what we get for the imputation rule now what value you want to replace if there are null values you can replace those null values but if the null values are not present then you can use a user specified value next we have is the replace with value that is with which value you want to replace it so average that means average of all values not including the incoming values to replace okay so basically the values that are already existing those average would be taken and that would be replaced in place of null values we have a median value that is the value separating the higher half from the lower half or the middle value we have the mode value that the value that appears most often or if you want to use a specified value that you want to replace that you can do okay so what i'm going to do is actually just work for the quantity part over here since i know that my data set is clean it has no null values so i'm just going to check a user specified value of 7 and i'm going to specify another value for it that is going to be 8 okay that's a minor change that i'm just going to do of course it would be undone because it has no meaning it's just to show you the usage of this tool next we have these two check boxes that is include imputed value in the indicator field that means there would be a field that would be added to specify whether or not a value has been imputed or you want to output the imputed value in a separate field that means the original field would be as it is but in a separate field the value would be outputted the imputed value okay so first of all let's just select the first option and run it to see how it works here it would take few seconds and then let's just see if it has worked for the quantity so now here we can see that um it's eight and the quantity indicator is showing 1 that means the change has been made over here and on the rest of the values it's showing 0. again it's showing 1 that means the value was originally 7 but now it has been changed to 8. so this is how the imputed value indicator field works next option is the output imputed values as a separate field so we can just select this option and click on run now what would happen is we would be getting a separate value in which the quantity value original field would be as it is like here it was seven but in the new values the field would uh new field the values would be eight over here from seven it changed to eight so this is how the imputation works but if the null values are present on your data or if you want to replace of any of the values numeric values only then you can use this imputation tool right now last but not the least we have the multifield binning tool now what is this tool it is actually uh used to replicate some of the functionality of the tile tool okay um basically it allows the data to be binned on multiple fields mainly it is used for the predictive tool set multifield billing tool accepts only the numeric fields just like the imputation tool we have just seen for the purpose of pinning we can pin the fields either in the form of the equal records or equal intervals so what is a bin uh if you just take a look at a histogram let's just bring up a histogram here right so this is a histogram and as you can see it shows the salary and the number of the players so 0 to 10 is actually an interval 10 to 20 is an interval right so this is called a bin histogram is depicted using bins and in order to create those bins we are going to use the multifield binning tool in ultrix so let's see how it works uh let's just get this over here and it would get all the numeric fields i'm going to do it on the basis of the sales the number of the tiles or the bins that you want to create so i want to create it 10 tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two options either equal records or equal intervals equal records what it says that the input records are divided into the specified number of pins each bin is assigned to assign the same number of records okay so the number of records would be equal in each bin um then we have equal intervals that means the minimum and the maximum values of the selected fields are determined and the records are assigned based upon these ranges so if we go with equal intervals that would be like more appropriate to get a varied length of the histogram then you can click on run so after a few seconds you would be getting this field uh it's on the base of sales right uh here is the field uh sales style num so what is the tile number all right now it's one and as you can see this one has um higher sales value of 1706 that's why it's been assigned to tile two and just like this if you just scroll over it you will get some other numbers as well so it's one two one and two and that was five over here it has a higher range of six thousand that's why it's been given a number five so just like this we have binned our sales records if you just get it into equal number of records and click on run so the records would be given two different bins uh equally like as you can see the different bins have been assigned the different bins have been assigned to each of these sales values okay so as we have specified 10 so uh the 10 tiles have been created and the maximum of a thousand tiles we can create so any number between 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the function of the multifield binning tool and these are all the major tools that you need to know about in the preparation group in alteryx that's all for this video and that's all for the preparation tools in altrix in the next video we would be looking at the other group which is the join group that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to alteryx tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at some of the tools that are present in the join tab of the alteryx tools in the previous videos we have already seen the inout tab and the preparation tab and their individual tools that are going to be useful for us while preparing the workflows in altrix in this video we are going to start a new tab that is the join tab so without any further ado let us start with the video in this video we are going to talk about a very special tool known as the append fields tool this append fields tool is present in the join tab as you can see denoted by a purple color now before starting with this tool what i have already done is i have already input my data that is the sample superstore data and from that data set i have taken the orders sheet in case you don't know where to get this data from you can simply google sample super store excel and that data site would be downloaded for you the reason why we are choosing this data set is because it is having a wide variety of data ranging from text to numbers location everything that one could ask for furthermore the data set is completely clean there are no inconsistencies so it would be easier for us to work on it and once you have downloaded the data set using the input tool you can simply just input the data then i have used two data cleansing tools which are in the preparation tab to clean the data now in case you're wondering what i have done over here i recommend you to just go through the previous videos where i've explained this process in a stepbystep fashion now once we have done with all this let us just go back to our append fields tool and bring it up over here as you can see the append fields tool has two anchors on the input that is t and s t stands for target and s stands for source and there is one output anchor so let us understand first of all what is this tool all about append fields tool is used to append the fields of one small input which is taken as a source denoted by the s over here to every record of another larger input that is the target the result is a cartesian join now in a cartesian join every row from one table is joined to every row of the other table like if there are two tables uh table one has like hundred rows and table two has thousand rows so the cartesian join would be 100 into thousand that is a hundred thousand rows in total so this is what happens in the cartesian join and in case you want to perform a cartesian join on your tables then you can use this append fields option okay the append field tool accepts two inputs which is again a target and a source the target is a larger data stream and the source is a smaller data stream that provides the records that are added to the target stream okay now in order to configure the tool here we can see the configuration panel over here we can use this table to modify the incoming data stream uh here each row is representing an individual column in the table as you can see row id order id order date ship date shipment etc now here what are the options what are the things that we can do is we can modify the type of the column like right now it's double but if you want to change it to anything else you can change it like i want int 16 over here so that its size also decreases if in the case of the strings you want to change the size you can do that as well if you want to rename a column that also you can do like instead of the row id i want s number to be present over here serial number okay so sno is what i want to rename it in case you want to provide a description for your columns that you can also provide now what would happen is once the correlation join is performed this is how the columns would be treated like with the description with the renamed value and with the modified type over here okay now uh this is a one thing that you can do now in case you want to select multiple fields like this then there is this options button that is present there are a bunch of options that you can use like save or load that means you can save the field configuration as a dot y x f t file uh which is ultrix field type file um that can be used in other workflows as well then we can use the select option to either select all of the columns or deselect them all we can change the field type of the highlighted fields this is only available if all the fields that you have highlighted are the same type so you can just change them to a common or a mutual type right next we have is the sort option which is of course used to sort the columns in assigning all the descending orders like uh sort on the original field name on a new field name on the field type or revert to the incoming field auto next we have is the move option that is used to move the highlighted columns to the top or the bottom of the list if you want to perform this option if you want to add some prefix to the field names if you want to add suffix to the field names if you want to remove any prefix remove any suffix or if you want to uh clear all the renames that you have done so far that you can do using this uh if you want uh the highlighted fields only whose renames you want to clear that also you can do reward all the original type and size that means all of the changes that you have done would be unchanged and so on these are all the options that we have available next we have is this option one slash error on too many records being generated so uh in this append fields tool it performs a cartesian join which means the number of the rows of both of these tables are actually multiplied with one another that means a huge number of rows would be generated right so it is a possibility that unintentionally you can produce so many errors so you can configure the warnings or errors to be reported so that not too many records are being produced now for this we have three options allow all appends that means all records should be appended to all the records with no error or warning next is one appends of more than three 16 records like if there are more than 16 records in the source file a warning is reported and the workflow continues processing third option is error on appends of more than 16 records so if there are more than 16 records in the source file then the error is reported and the workflow stops it processing so it is just to save the memory and provide a fail safe in case of the errors right so i'm going to go with all allow all appends just for this case to show you how this tool is gonna work okay so here i have actually um run the append fields tool let me explain to you quickly that what i have done uh the target we have already taken in the case of source what we have done is we have taken a few records around 5000 records for the source now where these records come from from the target itself we created three separate excel sheets on the basis of segment so if you just go to this particular data here you will find that there is this field called segment it has three possible values consumer home office and corporate these are the three segments okay so uh these three excel sheets were created in one excel sheet all the consumer related records were there in another there were all corporate related records and so on so just like that i have taken one more excel sheet which contains all the consumer records now this would act as my source because source is usually smaller in size than the target so a total of 5191 records were in this and a total of 9994 records were in this as you can see over here the number of the records is shown so what i have done is uh i have used these two things in the append tool and run this after running it i applied a browse tool the browse tool is nothing but it helps us to you know see that what is going on inside the tool if you just uh click over this append fields tool then you will see that this is the targets field it is same the changes that we did here that was renaming the serial name number row id to serial number is not been reflected over here and in the source we have the row id again with all the records present over here but as soon as we added the browse tool and click on run then it is going to show me the updated records like how many records were taken from there so a 5191 records from the consumer that means the source and 9994 records from the orders sheet that is the actual data set now it's going to take a few seconds and here you can see the percentage of the process that has been completed uh and along with this you can see the memory that it is being occupied right now it's 4.9 gb so let's just give it a few seconds and uh see what happens when it's fully run so let us make after it's completed fully after it's fully executed now uh the whole process has run and you can see uh due to the browse tool we are able to see that uh the first row that was row id initially has been changed to serial number and now we are getting uh the combination of the records that is um target the number of rows of the target multiplied by the number of rows of the source so this is the total number of records that we are getting and this is the size that is 7.9 gb so this is how the append fields tool or the cartesian join works in altrics that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about very important tools that are present in the join tab of the altrex tool now these tools are the find and the replace tool as the name suggests they help you to find for the values and if you want to replace your found value with any other value so for that also this tool is used okay so here in the workflow as you can already see i have input the data that is the sample superstore data and i have applied two data cleansing operations so this i have already explained in the previous videos in case you have not seen the videos i would recommend you to go and watch them to easily understand that what's going on here now once your data is clean let us make use of the fine and replace tool it is present in the joined app so here is the join nav and here is the finance replace tool let me just drag it over here now uh let us understand this tool it is used to find a string in one column of a data set and look up and replace it with the specified value from another data set right so you can use it to append columns uh as well uh now if we take a look at the configuration tab we have this find section and the replay section there are two different sections right in the find section we have these three radio buttons that can be chosen as per our wish first is beginning of field that searches for the instance of the field value at the beginning of the field the entire field does not have to contain what is being searched for next we have any part of the field which means it would search for the instance of the field value in any part of the field the entire field again does not have to be containing what is being searched for third is the entire field that it would search for the instance of the field value contained within the entire field the instance must be there in its entirety to be replaced with a new value then we have find within field option which is used to select the field in the table with the data to be replaced f is the input anchor by the data in the reference table and r is the input anchor uh that is being specified by which data to be replaced okay next we have is the find value that is um used to select the field from the reference table that is the r that contains the same values as the find within table in the original table okay next we have the case and sensor define and match the whole world only so what we will do is if we take a look at this orders table this we would be connecting to the replace okay next we would be getting another in out and let me just get the input data here what i have done is let me just move it a little bit here so what i have done uh is i have made some changes into the subcategory field and the category fields okay so what i'm gonna do is just first of all get the file over here and this is the file that i want yeah so here let's just click on ok and connect it to the find values okay so it is going to find the values and replace it okay so let me just go back to this tool if i just click on the output anchor of this first field what we would be getting here is 100 records actually and here you can see the uh sub category chairs is having a different spelling means there are some of the white spaces but in the case of this the output angle of the data cleansed field we'll find that in the subcategory the chairs are correct okay so we need to find the value of choose and replace it with this that means the subcategory field would be employed so let's just click on this uh entire field sub category and replace it with a subcategory value okay and that's the case in sensitive fine or let's just keep all the settings as this only and click on run now you can see that we have find in this f targets there are a number of records and in the r target that's the source there are a number of records if we click on the output anchor so the total number of records is 5191 that means the field where we have replaced the values right and the values would have been replaced over here okay so here we can just select the subcategory again and click on run so this is how the find and the replace tool works it is used to replace the values right so this was all about the find section let us now focus on the replace section so we have replace found text with value that means we have to choose the field from the reference table to update the original table that means the fine table uh if you want to replace multiple items then you can just check this button or you can just uncheck it append fields to record if you want to append a column from the find field to the replace field then you can just do that as well okay so these are the options uh that are available let me just append some records category and the product name records and click on run now if you just click on this output anchor then you can see category 2 and product name 2 are also available over here that means these have been appended in the final output so that's how the find and the replace tool works now let us talk about the other tool that is available which is known as the union tool so the union tool is a special tool which is again present in the join tab now what is the function of this tool it is used to combine two or more data sets on the column names or the position so on the basis of the column names or the position it is used to combine the data sets right and in the output each column contains the row from each input we can actually perform the union operation on the basis of the number of the columns or the position the name of the columns or the position of the columns right so if we take a look at this we have two uh columns we have two data sets right now that is the consumer segment data set and the corporate segment data set so if we just take a look at these data sets they all have the same values that is the same columns column names are same and the position is also same rate so we can just perform the union on both cases that is on the basis of name and on the basis of positions as well right so what we are going to do is uh we are just going to take both of them drag this union tool over here and we are going to connect them so this is one and this is two so we can just uh attach them both of them the one is the consumer and the second is the corporate now if we just check on this output tab what we would be getting is a combination of the rows that is 8211 records in total here you can see right uh then we have this for cross check we have the segment column where first of all the consumer values are there and then if you just scroll down we would be having the corporate values okay so this is what we are getting over here um now if you just go to this union tool here we have three options auto config by name that means if the column names is similar then you can use this option next is auto config by position that means if the position is similar then automatic configuration would be done on the basis of position so we can do that as well because uh in our case both of these things are same so there would be no change right but the third option that we have right now is the manual configuration by the fields so if you want to configure some fields to other values that you can do like here we have state and postal code so if you want to just change them with this interchange them like this okay and click on run so now what would happen is if you just go there in the state and the postal code these values would be interchanged with one another right to understand it in a better way we can just use the browse tool over here so that we can get to see the individual records and run it right now if we just go to this tool here we can find the postal code right and as you can see the longest value is not carolina uh the last alpha numeric value is winsconsin that means the values have been interchanged okay and similarly in order to check for the segment what we can do is just select the segment one segment field over here here is the segment field and there are two values the consumer segment and the corporate segment so that is how the union works for the union to work at least to the of the data sets must be available and they must have some of the common ground on the basis of which you can perform the union operation union operation is similar that is one table is appended over the other table no changes are made into the individual records only the appending operation takes place so that's all for this union tool and that's all for this video in the next videos we would be looking at some more tools of this joint app that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to ultrix tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the join tool in ultrix so the join tool is a part of the join tab group and it is a very useful tool in ultrix we would be seeing all about this tool in this video so first of all let us understand that what is the basic functions of this tool uh join rule is used to combine the two inputs based on some common fields between the two tables we can also join two data streams based upon the record position of those streams so for the join tool we have two inputs over here as you can see input data one we just click on it it would open the excel file so it has a few fields here and it is the segment field is the consumer segment as you can see all the segments are consumer over here in this field okay and the second we have is the same table but the number of records is different and the segment here is the corporate segment over here like this so here are the two sheets the consumer sheet and the corporate sheet which are actually a part um and taken as two different inputs to be joined together right that means we have two inputs with common fields between them which we need to join now let us drag this join tool over here as you can see this is a join tool and in order to perform the join we can actually use two options which are available in this configuration tab that is joined by record position or joined by specific fields now if we talk about join by record position this option is used when two tables have the same field structure and the data will be joined by its position within the two tables next we have is joined by specific fields it is used when the two tables have one or more fields in common and the data will be joined together on the basis of the common field only and we can choose to join based upon the multiple fields and each join should be a separate row in the grid like this is the grid so each join each criteria that you are giving for the join should be for a separate row in this table but i'm just going to go with the join with record position joined by record position first of all let me just drag this one to l and the other to r so l means left and r means right these are the two anchors that we are getting now each input l and r or left and right has a drop down list from where we can just actually select the fields uh or the join field for each of the inputs altered designer will automatically select the field for us as in this case you can see it has selected the row id field for us to be taken as the drop down uh as the joining field okay now we can just use this table to modify the data that means it's type we can modify like right now it's double we can just select it to in 16 to reduce its size a little bit we can rename it so let's just rename it to a serial number just to show you that how the changes are going to work and like this we can just modify it like the data type the size we can rename it or add a description so let's just add a description that is serial number like this okay so these are the changes that i have done all right and then there is this unknown column which is basically used in case we want to add more columns now uh in case of the view output there are these three options that is the l anchor that contains the records from the l input that didn't join to the records from the r input the j anchor that contains the records that join from the l and the r input and then we have the r anchor uh that contains the records uh from the r input that didn't join into the records from the l input so this is the um order and these are the three anchors that have been shown over here if we just click on run so the joining would occur let's just click on the l anchor to get the uh record from the l input that didn't join to the record from the r input so a total of 2171 records are there we click on j so 3020 records are j uh in this j anchor that means the records that have been joined from the l input to the r input over here as you can see there are 3020 records and in this r anchor we have no records that means there are no records in the r input that didn't join to the records of the l input so this is how the join tool works and uh there are these different types of joins that can happen uh in this using the join tool first is the inner join that we have done right now specified by this j anchor this is the inner join that contains the records that join from the l input to the records in the r input uh this l anchor refers to the left unjoined that contains only of the records that didn't join to those of the r and this r contains of the are unjoined records uh next we have is a possibility of a left outer join that all the records from the l input including the records that join with the r input right uh now this can be achieved with the help of two tools the join tool and the union tool um so what we can do is actually get a union tool here and if we just combine them together that means connect the j and l outputs of the join tool to the union tool so the l is connected let's just connect the j as well now if we just click on this output button and um just run it then what we would be getting is a total of 5191 records which is the result of the left outer join similarly if you want to get a result of the right outer join now what is right outer join uh that means all the records from the r input including the records that are joined with the l inputs again let's just get a union uh let's just drag the j and the r anchors over here and run the workflow so here it is let's just click on the output and this is around 3020 records that are a part of the right output join last but not the least we have the full outer join so that means all the records that are a part of the l and the r inputs are the full outer join uh full outer join is actually similar to uh the append fields join which means it actually performs a cartesian join a combination of all the records of both the tables would be shown over here and the total number of rows would be the product of the individual rows in the uh tables so either we can directly use the pain fields or if you don't want to use the print fields then you can actually use a third option so what i'm gonna do is just copy these three tools right click copy and create a new workflow out of them so as to avoid the confusion and here i am going to perform the full outer join so let's just get the union tool over here we need to connect all these three that is l j and r over here so first of all we need to connect the j output or the j anchor why we are doing it every time we are using the union tool after the join rule make sure you first connect the shape to establish the combined table schema that what is going to be the final table schema right then you can connect l and then you can connect r and then run this workflow so after a few seconds here is the output total of 5191 records would be displayed over here with all the values right and if you want to cross check your results what you can do is actually use the pen fields option so for this we are just going to copy these two tools you can select multiple by control clicking them right click copy go to the new workflow and paste them either using the shortcut ctrl v or simply just right click and paste right let me move it here get the append fields tool over here get it here and get it here run it allow all the pens and click on run it's going to take a few seconds of course apparent fields is a little bit slower option than the um union and the join tool combined so let's just wait for a few seconds and while you're waiting you can see actually the progress with which it is working on okay right so now if we just click on this output anchor then we would be seeing a total of all the records that are present over here so that is how the joints work uh the cartesian joint or the full outer join the left outer join the right outer join and basically all the types of the joints with the help of the join tool union tool and the apparent fills tool that is all that we would be looking at in this join tab and that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to alteryx videos in this video we are going to talk about a tool that is known as the regex tool in ultrix so rejects is basically stands for regular expressions and that helps us to find for particular values in the uh table okay so here is a few uh small setup that i have done for the rejects tool this is how a regex tool looks and it is a part of the parse tab in the ultrix so here is the rejects tool that's present it is used to leverage the regular expression syntax to pass match or replace the data so for the regex tool first of all the data must be present so i have taken a data that is the consumer statement data from the output excel sheets that we have already prepared in the previous videos in case you have not watched the videos i would recommend you to watch them to better understand what we are doing over here so once i have taken the data from the input data tool then let me just delete it once the next thing is to go to this parts tab and grab this regex tool over here okay now what we are going to do is connect these anchors like this and in the regex tools configuration we have the first option that is the configure the column to parse so here you can just select the column which we want to parse so what i'm gonna do is i'm just going to go with the customer name column that i want to parse next is in format to convert option we have to add the regular expression so here is the pearl five rejects syntax that has been followed by these regular expressions in case you do not know about the regular expressions and want to read about it then how can you go with it you can simply just go to google and here you can just search for regex altricks rejects two lal tricks are basically regexal tricks so if you just search for it you would get the first link that is help.alteryx.com that would give you the official altrix documentation for this tool and in this official documentation you will find this link that is perl regular expression syntax you can just click on this link and here is all the information that you need to know about the regular expressions before working on them like everything that um every syntax of regex that is being used is uh shown over here okay so you can take your time and uh read it understand it well and then come back to this video so let me just quickly show you that how these regular expressions are going to work here what we have is the plus sign which is the button that is used to access the common regular expressions that we may need by creating the expression so if you just click on this plus icon we would be uh seeing these operations like if you want to match for a single character you want to match for zero or more characters or one or more characters you want to measure the start of the word end of the word beginning with the line and the line and so on these are all the regular expressions and tags that have been given to you next is the case insensitive option just a second here is this case in sensitive option which is checked by default that means the searches that would be happening through regular expression would not distinguish between the upper case and the lowercase letters right next we have is the output where we have the output method which is used when parsing to configure the related properties like what you want to do once the expressions have been matched so we have four methods that are available the first one is replace so it means that we want to replace the expression that we have searched with a second expression now where you want to find the second expression that is in the replacement text you can enter the replacement text uh that we want the original expression to be replaced with again we have this plus that would uh allow you to actually uh find the entire text or just the particular character to be replaced okay the common regular expressions again that are needed and then we have the copy unmatched text to output if you want to copy it to the output as well that also you can do otherwise you can just remove it next option that we have in this output is the tokenize method that is used to split the incoming data using a regular expression uh it works in similar to the next tool that we have is the text to columns tool so we would be working more with the text to columns tool so i'm not going to explain everything over here and it has um some options like if you just select it tokenize method then you can see we have different options like a split to columns option like you want to split a single column of data at each instance to the specified delimiter into the multiple columns and what would be the extra behavior or the behavior of the extra columns like you want to drop them with the warning you want to drop them without warning or you want to show an error before dropping the columns then there is this output root name which is actually the original name of the column that we are going to use and if you want to split a single column of data at each instance of the specified delimiter into multiple rows then this option needs to be checked third method we have is the parse method it is used to separate the expression into new columns and set the name type size and expression for the new columns a new column is created in the output columns table with the its name its particular data type its size and the expression which is automatically populated so you can just specify name type and size last but not the least we have is the match option that is used to append a column containing a number that is one if the expression is matched and 0 if it did not matched now um column id column name for match status that means a new column would be created so what would be the name of the column that you can specify over here by default it is taken as order id underscore matched right um and there is this option of error if not match so if the expression is not matched and you want to generate some kind of an error that it would generate by checking on this option or by unchecking it okay so let's just see uh the practical application of this regular expression but before that let me just get a look of how the data is looking so here it is we are using the customer name in the customer name field we have um different customer names starting with different letters right so let's just go to the regular expression field and i wanted to start with any single character should be z okay and uh i just want a match column to be there that there should be a column that should be name underscore matched that if it is matched it should show me one otherwise it should show me a zero and click on run now wait for a few seconds till it's been run here now we can see that we are getting this name matched option where the results are false there should be some true results in order to get that what we are going to do is grab the browse tool over here and in this browse tool let's just run it once again run the workflow now in the browse tool uh we are going to go with the last record that is the name matched record so all our faults that means uh there were no records that had z in them right so let me just append my query just modify my query a little bit and here get a instead of set run it so here what we have done is added a and in this case uh check the option of error if not matched so if there is no matching in the first record itself then the error would be there so let me just turn on it so this is what we are getting as the error because the first letter was not a that is why it didn't match the expression and the error was there and it has finished its running in just 1.4 seconds okay so this is how the regular expressions work now let us move on to the next tool that we have and that is the text to columns tool so let me just create a new workflow and in this workflow what i'm going to do is just copy paste this input data okay so let's just copy it and paste it and grab this text to columns tool over here so it would give me the um freedom to just you know uh split the columns like we have the order id column in which hyphen can act as a delimiter so i want to split this column so let's just go to this um tool select order id column the delimiter specified needs to be hyphen the number of columns that needs to be created is three and uh leave if there are any extra columns then leave it in the last column and output root name is going to be order id right let's just click on run and now what we can see is a total of 24 fields so here what we are getting order id 1 order id 2 and order id id3 since there were only three things so three have been shown over here in case there were multiple uh hyphens like let me just decrease the number of columns to two and click on run then what would happen is we would be getting order id 1 and in the last column the combination of both of them like order id 2 and 3 with a hyphen is present over here if you want to rename the column you can just rename it simply uh using the tools that we have seen in the past so um any kind of a renaming that you want to perform that you can do so that's all for this video in which we looked about the rejects tool and the takes two columns tool uh in the parse tab of the altrix that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a very important tool in ultrix known as the count records tool so count record tool is present in the transform tab in the ultrix it is used to return the count of the number of the records that are passing through the tool now we can use this tool when we want to report on the resulting record uh or the record count that is being used in the workflow um it even returns account of a 0 as well so in case you are wondering that how would you get the total number of records then you can do that with the help of the count records tool now you can get that on the entire database or you can apply some filters and get the records that match that particular filter as well so i'm going to show you the example for both let me first get the input data tool and get my data that is stored in this output excel file the consumer sheet now if i just run it right now i would be getting all the records that are present in there that is a total of 5191 records okay now the thing is i'm going to uh go to this output and apply a filter over here right so let's just use this filter tool here and the filter is going to be a basic filter that is i want to select the segment where the segment value is let's just get a value for the segment or let's just get a value for say category that is equal to technology so let me just apply the filter that is for the category if it is equals to technology okay then run this and we would be getting in the true part we are getting 951 records and in the false part we are getting 4000 some records okay so if you just go to the true part and then go to the transform tab get this count records uh filter or this count records tool and apply it over here then we just go to its output part okay or basically we just run this tool then what we are getting is 951 as the total because it is only added to the true part if i also connect this false part to here then you can see it's um not able to connect because this account records tool only accept one input right so to get the number of the false records we add another account records tool and click on run so now for this second count records tool if you just click on its output part we are getting four two four zero that's the number of the records for the false and this is the number of the records 951 is the number of records for the true part in case we decide to remove this filter right let me just remove this filter over here and also delete one of the counter calls tool then what can i do is directly connect my database to this count records tool now if i just run it then what do we get is 5191 that is the total number of records in the actual database so that's how the count records tool works either through filter or without the filter okay next tool that we are going to see is the cross tab tool so let me just save this workflow and move on to our second tool that is the cross tab tool now what is it usage of this tool it is used to pivot the orientation of the data in a table what it does is it moves the vertical data fields onto a horizontal axis and summarizes the data whenever it is specified it is in reverse application of the transpose tool which of course we would be seeing as well so there is no limit on the number of the rows or the columns that can be passed through this crosstab tool okay so for this crosstab tool what i have done is i have taken another database or i have created another database let me just use that because it is fairly small so it would be easier to understand for us so this database is present in the form of a named range in excel it has two columns the number of hours and the score so the name of the range is the scores so let me just get that click on ok this is how it is looking it has around 10 records okay it gives us the number of the hours the student has 30 and the score that he has scored okay let's just go to the transform tab and get our crosstab tool over here now once we get there uh it would ask us that if we want to group the data by any of these values so it is all the available data values that are present in the data set if you want it to be a grouped with a specific value you can just select that next is um if you want to create a value or change the column headers so a new column would be created for each of the unique values in this particular um header so the number of hours then we have values for new columns so these values would be used to propagate the new columns that are created by the number of hours now if you want to aggregate it um then you can just aggregate it using these all options so what all options we have some average count uh percent row percent column total first and last so what we are going to do is just go with the total row and a total column and click on run now here um we just select on the output tab here this is the output that we are getting that is the total of the rows and the columns is 733 if we just um now instead of getting this total row and the total column i am changing the method of aggregating values to sum and just deselect them both and click on run now what would be getting is the record and the sum of the scores over here so this is how it is looking so this is basically the usage of the cross tab tool in altrix now let us take a look at the tool that is very similar to the crosstab tool and it is known as the transpose tool so let me just save it and what is the transpose tool it is actually somewhat different from the crosstab tool it is used to pivot the orientation of the data table it is basically used to transform the data so what we can do is the horizontal data fields would be shown on the vertical axis it is the reverse application of the crosstab tool and it is useful for extracting the nonconforming data there is no limit again on the number of records of the fields that could be transformed so here is the input data part that is same with the um crosstab tool that we just saw that is the number of hours and the score now let's go to this transform tab and get this transpose tool so when we get this transpose tool these are the configuration panel options that we are getting first is the key columns so from here we can select the columns to pivot the table around this name remains on the horizontal axis with its value replicated vertically for each data field that is selected so let me just select them all next is the data columns now that means that we can select the columns to carry through the analysis so let's just keep number of hours over here and the score over here here we have an option of a dynamic or unknown column so if you want to go for a dynamic or unknown columns as well you can just keep it checked okay you can just go to this question mark to run about uh to read about it that is running a workflow can introduce the new columns that were unknown at the configuration time so if you want to include those new columns you can make sure that this option is checked that's for a further step towards security last but not least we have the missing columns option that means what action we want to take if some of the columns are missing we want to report an error and stop processing the result we just want to throw a warning and continue on with the results or we just want to completely ignore it right so let's just keep up on one and click on run now what happens is um if you just click on the output panel this is how it's looking the number of hours is same the name has been changed to score and its value is being shown like this so basically score has been transposed into a horizontal row instead of a vertical a vertical column so this is what the function of the transpose tool is and this is what it has done now if you want you can compare it with the crosstab tool the cross tab tool what it did was it transformed the horizontal rows into the vertical columns now we have these columns for all of these values right but what the transpose tool did was just opposite of the crosstab tool it took the name of the column or the header of the column that was score and created multiple rows out of it the value for each of that was uh written over here like the value value value like this okay now in this transpose tool if we just select all the key columns and click on run once again then what would happen uh then we would be getting like this no values because we have transposed both of these columns so no none of the values are remaining with us okay and let me just show you another possibility that is if i just decide to transform the number of hours instead of this course value so this is how it would be looking the number of hours would be taking up the horizontal rows and its values would be assigned like this with a value field so name and value it would be taken in the form of a pair so that's all for this video in which we learned about three tools of the transform tab and thanks for watching the video hello everyone welcome to altrix tutorials in this video we are going to talk about two very important tools of the transform tab these are the running total tool and the summarize tool so first of all let's start with the running total tool this tool is present in the transform tab in ultrix and it is used to calculate a cumulative sum on a numeric field per record in a fill it can also be used to create sums of groups of records and calculate the cumulative sums of multiple fields at the record or even at the group level so let us understand the usage of this running total tool with the help of an example right so let me just first get my data using this input data tool which is present in the in out tab now let's just click on this drop down and get our excel sheet which is the consumer sheet click on ok now let's just grab this running tool tool and bring it over here here we have two options that are present in this running total tool in the configuration panel that is the group by field which is again optional and the second option is the create running total field so it helps us to create the numeric fields to create a running total basically to select the fields through which we want to create a running total in your database there might be different kinds of fields like the textual fields the date fields a spatial object fields but the running total tool will automatically fetch out the numerical fields and would give you only those fields on which it is applicable right so these are all the numeric fields that are present in my data set that's why it's showing the list of all of them right now uh what you want is you can just select the fields of whose running total you want the new columns would be created and they would be added with a run total underscore prefix to show that this was the original record and this is the total that has been calculated by this particular tool so let's just see how it is going to work i want the total of sales quantity discount and profit these are the four values whose total i want next what i can do is i can click on run and wait for a few seconds till it has finished running this is how it's looking if i just click on this output tab over here or using this anchor then i would be getting these uh four columns running total underscore sales quantity discount and profit this means that this is the total values that have been calculated by this particular tool if you go to the very last record you would be of course getting the highest value or the total value of the sales quantity discount and profit if you take a look on the profit values then there is a point where these values are in negatives which means i'm not getting a total profit i am getting some of the loss from my sales but slowly if you see the values have again converted them into the positives that means the total value is a profit or a loss that would be getting for the last record so this is how the running total uh tool works it is actually used to give you a summary of the numeric fields that i've been working on next we have is the summarize tool now this is a really important tool in altrix and we are going to use it often whenever we are developing the workflows so let us understand it's working first of all it is used to perform the various actions which could be the functions or the calculations on the data it can like return the sum of the column for the data which is basically calculated by adding all the rows in the column it can return the minimum or the maximum value in the column it can count the number of rows it can group the column of a data by identical values it can concatenate the string values it can perform a variety of mathematical calculations and even perform spatial object processing now uh these are a variety of steps that are really important whenever we are working with a workflow right so let's just see some of the actions one by one to understand it let's me just grab my summarize tool and connect it connect my database the database here i'm using is the excel sheet for the consumer segment okay now here we have two things the fields and the actions the fields is basically the data fields that has been taken from the input data set along with its data type okay now what we can do is we can just select some of the fields and if you want to select multiple fields you can just shift and click on them like this okay or what you can do is control click them to select multiple fields then we have is a select option which has different options like all which means it would select all the fields none it would deselect all the fields numeric it would select only the fields with the numeric data type string would select only the string fields and spatial would select only the fields with the spatial data types right so these are the kinds of options that we could perform let me just select the numeric fields so you can see the row id sales quantity discount and profit have been selected next uh what we need to do is once you have selected the fields we come to this add option so uh this add option is actually used to just search for the action that we need to perform you just click on it here are the different options that could be performed we can find the minimum value the maximum value the sum count count nonnull count distinct count distinct normal count null group by first last and these are the number of the functions that could be applied like numeric functions string functions uh spatial functions behavioral analysis and the report functions okay so if we just go to the numeric functions uh here is the number of the functions that could be applied like average percentile median and mode so what i'm gonna do is i'm just going to select none and i'm going to show you the different functions that could be applied for each of the data types that is double string and uh we don't have spatial data so let me just go with numeric and the string values only okay so first of all let's just select these four i'm ignoring the row id because that's no need for that next what we can do is just go to this numeric fields and here select the percentile now in the action field we have the fields the action cell could be performed and what would be the name of the output field if you want to change the name of the output field that you can do if you want to change the action that also you can do for example in the case of sales i want the max value in the case of quantity i want the percentile in the case of discount or in the case of discount i want percentile in the quantity again i want the minimum value and in the case of profit i want the sum okay so these are the four different actions that i want to perform on the different fields and once you have selected all of these things you can just simply click on run and wait for a few seconds let's just go to the output so it is giving me the maximum value of the sales the minimum quantity that was purchased was one the percentile discount is point two percent and the total sum of the profit that i have taken is this much of the profit okay uh now the names of the columns have been named accordingly which means you can understand that what's what is going on in these right this is for the numeric values let me just copy this create a new workflow to show some of the functions for the string values as well okay here i can just paste them and for this tool i'm just going to make the changes by selecting the string values and what are those things that i could add is count null count not null so let me just give go with the count if you want to delete any of these actions you can just simply select that action and click on minus select that action click on minus okay so this is what i am going to go with that is the count in the case of category i want count distinct in the case of category a subcategory also i want to count distinct in the case of segment i want count non null in the case of country i want count null and so on okay i have created a bunch of different actions uh in the case of customer id i want the longest okay now once i have selected all these operations i can click on run so it's going to take a few seconds and let us just go to this output to select the uh to just see the values so first of all is count that would give me the count of order id next is count two that is giving me the count of the ship mode which is actually the total number of the records next is the longest customer id then the customer name customer segment then count of the null in the country is zero that means there are no null values right similarly for the count distinct category there are three distinct categories that's why it's giving me the result as uh three similarly in the case of subcategory it is counting it as 17 that are 17 distinct subcategories at present and finally we have the count of the product name so there are 5191 products that are available that means everyone has purchased some products so this is how the summarize tool works in the transform tab that's all for this video that's all for the tools for the transform tab and thanks for watching hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about a new tab that is the reporting tab in our tricks so this tab might not be by default present in your ultrex designer view so what we are going to do is actually see that how can we add the few tabs that are supported by alteryx okay so what we are going to do first of all it's just go to this option this plus icon which would automatically give you an option to add or remove the tools so let's just click on that this would open up the configure tool palette that means all the tools that are actually supported by address but are not being shown on your screen right now so here if you just go and check there are many of the tools that are actually supported by ultrex okay so from here what i'm gonna do is i'm just going to support uh this check on this reporting tab so this would give me a bunch of other tools that i'm gonna use uh like email image insight interactive chart layout map legend overlay render report and table okay so let's just click on ok once we do that this is the reporting tab that would be present in front of us and these are the tools supported by the reporting tab in this video we are going to take a look at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are of very important in this whole workflow building thing okay so first of all let's just bring up the table tool now uh i have already used the input data tool to get my data set let us just understand the usage of the table tool as the name suggests table tool is used to create a data table or a pivot table to output the report through the render tool okay so as you can see this is the render tool if you want to output the report the render tool is what we are going to use so uh if we just talk about this tool we first have the table mode which means you can select the basic table or the pivot table pivot table is uh basically used when we are using the data from the crosstab tool in case you have not seen the video the crosstab tool i would recommend you to first go and watch it and then you would be able to understand it easier uh that what i'm trying to say okay so i'm just going to go with the basic table next option we have is the group by option that means the fields through which you want to group by these um values if there is anything so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to group by category and sub category okay next we have is the value of a table width which is basically how you want to adjust your table so automatic that means the minimum width percentage you want a particular percentage fix you want a particular fixed value okay so i'm just gonna go with automatic right next we have is the column headings if you want to show the column headings or not then we have the option of a bar graph so if you want to create a bar graph just a second let me just adjust it a little bit yeah so if you want to create a bar graph that means you can specify the data field for which the bar graph needs to be created in the table and this bar graph option is only available for the basic table in case you have selected the pivot table over here then this option would not be available now you can just click on the settings to modify the style of the graph like its weight scale its space value label bars colors etc but i'm not just gonna go into very much deep into this bar graph option right now right now we're just going to focus on the table tool okay uh next is show column headings which is of course let me just uncheck this bar graph so that would be available to us if you want to show the column headings then we have the per column or the methodology configuration option if the table mode is basic then we can configure the columns and if the table mode is the pivot mode then we need to configure the methodologies so in case we have selected basic mode so we are getting the option as per column configuration now we can use it to select the data fields that we want to include in the table using these up and down arrows that are present over here we can just set their order uh we can just rename these fields as well so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna uncheck some of these fields okay and i'm just going to go with the only few fields over here okay uh category is a category product name like this okay i am just uh interested in these fields only okay now if you want uh to configure the attributes of a particular field you can just select that particular field and these attributes would be available for you if you want to get a new name for the field so insert the consumer name i'm just going to go with the name if you want to select its width its alignment its borders prefix surface anything you want to select you can just select uh this dec places for the number of the decimal places so if you just select some numerical value let's say the sales value so this field would be enabled okay and like in the prefix i want a dollar symbol to show me that this was the dollar amount and in the end i want to i don't want any suffix just for the prefix i want the dollar okay for the sales and that's it if you want to create some of the column rules you can just create the column rules which basically uh says that what you want to do if you want to apply some kind of a formatting for it so the sales rule one is you apply to the data when the sales is greater than equal to a thousand dollars you can just say the background color must be kind of like green so if the sales value is greater than a thousand dollar i want a green uh background color okay so this is the rule that i have applied okay now next two options we have is the default table settings that means the style options that we want our table to contain would be changed over here or if you want to create a rule for um to be applied to all the columns of the data that you can apply using this create row rule option so these are the options that you can control or configure in this table tool now once you are happy with the changes that you have made you can click on run and yes so here is how the output is looking we have categorized them or we have grouped them on the basis of category and sub category uh and this is the table uh this is the table that we have got over here just a second okay now uh if you want to get to show the staple how would you be able to show it so for that what we need to do is to view the individual records and see whether the changes that you have made in the table are been actually made or not we can simply use a browse tool that is present in the in out tab okay so once we have used the browse tool and run the workflow this is the kind of the output that we would be getting as you can see the number of the fields have been reduced drastically we are now only getting the fields which we actually modified right and if you just want to scroll up and down to get a better view that also you can get here you can see in the sales the prefix is added that is a dollar symbol and whenever the sales quantity is more than a thousand dollars we are getting the color the background color as green this was the rule that we created for this values right so you can see all these values are colored in green now so this is how the whole field or the whole table tool is looking now let us talk about how can you actually render this table okay now here what we have done is created a copy of these two things the basic table and the data in order to render it we go to the reporting tab and grab the render tool the render tool is actually used to render or transform the report snippets into the presentation quality reports into a variety of formats now the formats supported by it are these html compressor pdf rdf word excel png image or a specific output file so from this you need to select the specific output file option in the output file you can just click on this save file and select the format in which you want to save the file i am going with the excel and here you need to type a name so let me just grab the name that is report table over here and click on save now once you do that uh the path would be taken you can just select these different options like if you want a header you want a footer for the table or not that you can just select okay the page of this paper size the orientation for the report as well then click on run once you do that the rendering needs to be completed so let's see when it's completed you can just go to this location where you have saved the file and you would see that the changes have been made so here is the report table that we just created the excel sheet and this is how it is looking uh it has been rendered as it is we required like all the changes all the rules have been applied so that's all for the render tool and that's all for this video as well thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to ultrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about the creation of a visual data representation in ultrix so it is possible through different tools but we would be looking at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are primarily used for this purpose so if we talk about the table tool we have studied all about it in the previous video in case you haven't watched it already i would recommend you to just go there and watch it first to understand its basics because in this video i'm not just going to explain the basics again i'm simply just going to show you the application of the uh table tool especially the bar chart part so let's just go to the table tool or this is the basic table tool that we have been using now here if you see there is this option of bar craft so what i have done over here is in this bar graph option i have selected sales and the settings all the settings i have kept as same okay or basically the default settings then what i have done is i have used the render tool and in the render tool i have uh outputted it in the form of a pdf file so once i run this workflow what would happen is i would be getting this kind of a report now all the settings for the table tool are same as we did for the previous file but the format of the file has changed from excel to pdf right now now you can see all these things have been shown like this only but whatever the sales amount is like 732 is the sales amount so a bar a slide bar of light blue color is shown along with its value 71 for 90. so this is how the bar chart tool works we have selected it for the sales value so for the sales value this is how it's been shown like it shows us the bar that would roughly give us an estimate of the quantity that is being or the total sales amount that it is contributing ah with respect to the total amount so this is how we can use the bar chart of the visual representation within a table using the table tool now let us move on to the tool that is specifically designed for this purpose and that is the interactive chart tool so first of all let me just save this workflow and close it because we don't need it anymore we are going to take a look at the interactive chart tool now now what is this interactive chart tool it is used to basically visualize the data in the workflow we can create charts uh interactive multilayered bar charts line graphs scatter plots pie charts and more we can use your uh the data set that we've been using to calculate the sum count average minimum maximum of the selected fields and output them into the different file types again using the render tool so first of all let's just get the input file this is our input tool let me just get the file i'm starting with a simple file so let's just go with this course file right now and now what i'm gonna do is apply the interactive chart uh tool over here okay so we can just configure the chart by clicking on this configure chart option and it's going to open up this kind of a dialog box the interactive chart dialog box which would help us to configure the chart okay so we can just create the chart over here in this as you can see there is a format of a chart that's been given to us so we can just create the chart like this control the zoom control the location and everything okay so for this data first you have to ensure that what kind of a chart you want to create i want to create a bar chart okay so once you are in this interactive chart workflow you can just go to create click on layer and here you need to just select on add layer option uh you can give a name to the layer by default it's taken as layer 0 but you can give it any name so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to add bar chart okay then we have the type option in this you need to just select the type of the chart to the bar then uh we have the x which means you need to select the column of which you want on the x axis so i want the uh score on the xaxis on the yaxis i want the number of hours okay so that's number of hours and scores to be taken over here okay then what we can do is we can just go to the template if you want a particular template to be used otherwise we can just go with it and so once you have made all the changes as per your choice you can just close that dialog box and bring in the browse tool this would help you to take a look at the chart that you have created so this is the bar chart that we have created based on the data as you can see um here is 98 that is the score and nine is the number of the hours the student has studied so this is how we have got the chart for us but uh if you want to just zoom in you can just zoom in and out of it to get a better look at how the things are looking inside the chart right so this is how basically the chart is created and if you want to create it for different things what we can do is first of all get rid of this data set and bring in our sales data because it has more scope of grading charts it has more values right so let's just go to this output excel file and get in our consumer data set right again we go to this chart option configure chart now there are all types of configurations that you can apply uh right now you can see the score and the number of hours is missing so what we can do is just get rid of it add a new layer again it's going to be a bar chart right now the type is again going to be bar in the column uh i'm just going to get the in the x axis i'm just going to get the sales amount and in the y i'm just going to get the category okay so the category by sales is what i want uh next what i can do is just basically close it go to the browse tool and run it to get the overview it's going to take a few seconds depending upon the processing speed of your computer and then it would render an output for you so once we have made the changes uh then this is how the output would be looking uh this is the sales on the basis of the category that is furniture office applies in the technology category and these are the individual sales records that we are getting right now okay uh now using this uh chart tool we can actually configure the chart the way we like okay so there are multiple configuration options that are available like if you just go to this layer option there are these different types of um options that you can perform like uh the opacity you can select the border width you can select the border color you can just select and everything like this okay so this is how it's gonna look um we can just select the different bar modes like stack or overlay or relative to one another next we have is the option for the legion so if you want to work with the legions like if you want to show the lesions or not then you can just select them also you can just hide them all together if you don't want to be shown in the layers panel here you can just select the orientation of the chart as well like this okay so this is what we can do then we have this access part where we can just select the display range like what is the maximum and the minimum range that you want the access line you want to show or hide the grid lines you want to show or hide etc all these things you can just select okay and then we have the batch if you want to create patched charts or not so this is how we work with these charts uh this is a simple bar chart that we have created now let us just move on to another type of a chart uh that we are going to create which is a pie chart let's just see how do we create that real quick so what i'm gonna do is just create a new workflow and in this i'm just going to copy these two tools actually the three tools can be copied all of these three rules can be copied and pasted over here now for the pie chart what we are going to do is actually create it on the basis of the sales and the category that means there are three categories and i'm just going to get the bifurcated amount of sales for each of these categories so um let's see how do we do that so in the configure chart option we go to the layer and just select the type to pi the values i have taken to sales and the labels i have set to category this is how it is looking and the name of course i have renamed it to pie chart for more clarity on what is going on now this is how it is looking it is giving me the percentage of the sales in case you want to give it a chart title you can just click here and provide it with a title or if you want to save it as a png file you can just click on this floppy disk icon and you would be able to save it so i'm just going to save it as a chart and let's just see how it is looking so this is my chart.png this is how it's looking this is a legend that tells you that blue represents technology orange represents furniture and green represents office supplies so that's how the charts are created in ultrix that's all for this video thanks for watching hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the chart creation process only but in this video we are going to take a look at how can we create batch charts and what is basically the concept of batch charts in ultrix so the batch charts are basically used to group the data as we previously saw in the video that we created a pie chart which provided us the sales percentage and the sales amount on the basis of the category now there are two things as we know in our data set that are present for grouping the data that is category and subcategory so here we have category and then we have sub category so what i want to do is i want to create separate pie charts for three separate categories firstly in the furniture category chart i want the different sub categories that are part of the furniture and then i want them to show me that what is the total sales that has been done in each of these categories right similarly i want to create it for office supplies category and then for the technology category now instead of creating three charts each for separate categories what i'm going gonna do is i'm just going to create a single chart with the help of the bad chart option alteryx would automatically create copies of the same chart for me right so let us see how we are going to do that here what we have is three tools the input tool the chart tool and the browse tool so first of all let's just go to the interactive chart tool click on configure chart option in the configuration panel to open up this interactive chart okay now first of all you need to go to this batch option and by default it would be turned to off so you need to click it to on it would ask you to select the columns through which you are going to group by your options so uh i'm going to group them by category so from the drop down you can just select category if you want another field through which you want to group it by so you can select the second field as well if you want custom title for the batched charts that you can do but i'm not just going to go with it uh the category is written and i'm fine with it okay next go to the layers option click on add layer and let's just provide it a name like pi chart okay now select the type to pi for the values what i'm going to do is select the sales value and let's just give it a few seconds till it is going to fetch all the records from the sales and put them over here so this kind of a chart is being generated which is of course very difficult to understand because it is not a correct chart then what i am going to do in the labels column i am going to select the sub category so now our chart is clean and what we are getting over here is the name of the category which is furniture now in this furniture we have four sub categories the chairs which is represented in the blue color tables represented in the orange color bookcase is represented in the green color and furnishings represented in the red color so the total sales of the furniture whatever the total sales value of the furnitures was it has been bifurcated into these four subcategories and it has uh taken the percentages as this so in the furniture most of the sales has been done by chairs that is 43.6 percent then if we just click on the second page we would have the office supplies category which combines these subcategories from storage till fasteners now in each of these sub categories how the bifurcation of the sales has been done is being shown on the percentage basis on the third we have the third subcategory which is the technology category having four subcategories again with phones accessories machines and copiers now what customizations we can do over here is by going into this chart option uh and in this font option like if you want to change the font it says everything that you can change like if you want to increase the size so as to get a better look at what is happening over here okay then we have layers option through which you can just uh change the colors like these are the colors that have been taken by default but if you want some other color scheme to be there you want some other colors to be there that also you can change okay like this the divergent scales are there or the sequential scales are there to for a particular color that you can just select okay uh then we have the slice label that is what you want to be shown on the slice label right now the percentage has been shown if you want the value has to be shown as well that means what is the total number of sales that was done that you want to show and the label that means the value of the subcategory that to which subcategory it belongs that also you can select i'm just going with label and percentage not with the value part the order is sorted which means they are all sorted and if you want to show the legend or not this is the legion part you want to show it you want to hide it and then if you just hover over it then we are getting some additional information as well so that is uh controlled through this over text value so i don't want the percentage to be shown i just want the label and the values to be shown over here okay because the percentage is already visible over here next we have is the chart option which you can use to set the width of the chart in pixels or in inches you can just select the um margins and the padding color etc the background color of the chart everything that you want you can just control from here okay so this is a custom color that i want uh this is the title if you want to change the title you can change it over here using latex or using a simple uh text as well then we have the access option which is not uh been used over here next we have is the legion if you want to just change the way the legend is being shown that you can do you can just work with its size its color let me just get a black color for the legend for better visibility then we have the box if you want a box to be there on the legend the color of the border for the legion it's going to be red and the background color or if you want a different background color let's just go with this kind of color the orientation you wanted vertically or horizontally like this and the layer order of that what is the order of the layers accordingly you want that or not okay so this is where it is starting from storage all the way to fasteners okay uh then you can just close this and using the browse tool you can just run the browse tool to get a look at the chart so here it is how it is looking you can just adjust it and see that these three charts are lined one after the other now let us just render this chart using the render tool so let's just delete this browse tool for a bit go to the reporting and here we have this render in this render what i'm gonna do is just select the specific output file and save it uh in the form of png images three images would be created and select bulk charts or batch charts okay now click on save and if you just go to that location bad charts.png is what we are getting over here okay so let me just take a look at this so uh this is the kind of the image that we are getting over here and if you just zoom in these are being created like this uh in the form of a png image okay now let's see what happens if we just um store it in the form of a pdf document so for saving it i'm just going to select a pdf document here and just select batch charts as the name click on save and click on run to run the workflow so that the actual uh saving process occurs okay now let's just see how it is looking so here it is three pages have been created for the pdf each for a different category along with its legend along with its chart along with its everything so this is how we can use the render button to render the batch charts for us and that's all for this video with this we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course on ultrix as well during this course we learned about the different tools and their functionalities we also got to see that what all actions we can perform through alteryx and we got to understand that there are a bunch of things that we can do now with more practice we would be able to create a really good charts for us render them and use it as the tool it is meant to be so that's all for this video that's all for this course i hope you all learned something new throughout this course i really hope you all enjoyed this journey uh thanks for watching goodbye
