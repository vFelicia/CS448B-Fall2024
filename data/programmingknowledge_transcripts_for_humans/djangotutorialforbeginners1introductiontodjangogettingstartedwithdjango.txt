00:00 - hello everyone welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge so I welcome you all to
00:04 - programming knowledge in this tutorial
00:05 - we would talk about Django
00:07 - so Django is an a python-based web
00:10 - framework so in this tutorial we will
00:12 - learn about what requirements we need to
00:14 - have on a machine to run Django so what
00:18 - tools and code editors require to have
00:20 - so that we can run Django on your local
00:22 - machine so before I start I would like
00:25 - to show the content we are going to be
00:27 - covering in this video so first we will
00:29 - discuss about Django by the official
00:32 - documentation of the Django then we will
00:34 - talk about the tools and code editors
00:35 - what we require them and why we need
00:38 - them and then we will talk about how the
00:40 - steps to install Django so these are the
00:42 - steps how we can install Django and how
00:44 - we can start ok the Django project and
00:46 - the Django app on our local machine so
00:48 - Django is a high-level Python web
00:51 - framework that encourages rapid
00:53 - development and teen pragmatic design so
00:56 - it was built by experienced developers
00:58 - it takes care of much of the hassle of
01:00 - web development so you can focus on
01:02 - writing your app without needing to
01:04 - reinvent the wheel it's free and open
01:07 - source in that Django is usually based
01:09 - on MBT packed and modal view template so
01:13 - this I'm referring to the official
01:15 - documentation of the Django so it says
01:18 - there is a model layer so model layer
01:22 - used for structuring and manipulating
01:24 - the data of your web application so the
01:27 - M stands for model and this model layer
01:30 - is used for structuring and manipulating
01:32 - the data of the web application the next
01:34 - we have is the view layer and the view
01:37 - it is responsible to encapsulate the
01:39 - logic responsible for processing your
01:41 - users requests and for returning the
01:43 - response so all the business logic is is
01:47 - encapsulated inside the view layer and
01:49 - it is responsible for building the logic
01:51 - and how the user can request and how you
01:55 - response to that particular request so
01:57 - this is all about in the view layer so
01:59 - next we have is the template layer so
02:01 - template layer provides a designer
02:03 - friendly syntax for rendering the
02:04 - informations how you want to present the
02:06 - data to the user so the all the
02:08 - front-end part that is HTML CSS
02:10 - JavaScript is is there
02:13 - the template layer how you can design
02:15 - your front-end parts how you can want to
02:17 - show that data or you show that design
02:20 - your page to the user is all defined
02:22 - inside the template layer before we
02:23 - create a django server on a local
02:25 - machine and we run it on a local machine
02:27 - you can go to the official website of
02:29 - the Python you can move to downloads in
02:32 - the according to your operating system
02:33 - you can download Python and when please
02:37 - make sure one thing that when you have
02:39 - downloaded the Python and when you run
02:41 - the installer what you have to do is you
02:44 - will get a window like this on your
02:46 - screen and it says like installed Python
02:48 - three point six point two a 64-bit
02:50 - version what you need to is make sure to
02:53 - enable this option that add a three
02:55 - point six to two pi so because this
02:58 - would add Python zip-t point any version
03:01 - you are using that is typed Python three
03:03 - point X the X could be 3.5 3.6 3.7 so
03:05 - you forget do the path and you can
03:07 - access Python wire come on line I will
03:09 - sure this you yeah I would open the
03:12 - command line yeah this looks better with
03:14 - a good font size so what I want you to
03:16 - do is now when you have installed Python
03:19 - on your local machine you just need to
03:21 - type Python it says yeah it says Python
03:25 - three point eight point one after inch
03:27 - download and download install and python
03:29 - to your path and running Python from the
03:31 - command line you can move the SQLite
03:32 - studio and the SQLite studio used to
03:35 - interact with the SQLite database were
03:37 - initially we are going to work with
03:39 - SQLite database and Django so you can
03:41 - this is this provides your graphical
03:43 - user interference so you can click on
03:45 - this link download windows binary
03:47 - opening link you open this link in the
03:50 - new tab so what you can do according to
03:53 - your operating system you can download
03:55 - the file from here and solve it on your
03:57 - machine next what you can do is install
03:59 - Visual Studio code you so
04:01 - Visual Studio code is the code editor we
04:04 - are going to use for this series we are
04:06 - going to use Visual Studio because the
04:08 - best part of this is that it has an
04:10 - integrated terminal inside it so I can
04:12 - show you this thing like we this is the
04:15 - kusuda code and like we have feared
04:17 - doing some projects so we can interact
04:19 - with the Visual Studio code as well now
04:21 - the third part like you have covered the
04:23 - a and the B part and in the third third
04:26 - part we are going to see
04:27 - Stefon soul jangle so what you can do is
04:29 - open your come online I would recommend
04:32 - you to run this come on pip pip is and
04:34 - piping base package manager so it helps
04:37 - you to install packages and likes
04:38 - libraries externally a why combined I'm
04:41 - so what you need to type is pip install
04:42 - Django so this would install Django new
04:46 - machine but like I have already sold
04:48 - Django on my machine so it might tell me
04:50 - that requirement already satisfied
04:52 - because I've already installed you can
04:54 - go on my local machine so to check this
04:57 - what you can do I would recommend you to
05:00 - type Python so python has been run by a
05:03 - command line and our type import Chango
05:07 - nine that then next you can type django
05:10 - door version so this will return me the
05:14 - django version which has been solved
05:16 - successfully on my machine so that list
05:18 - look great that Django has means along
05:20 - my machine so for so what you need to do
05:22 - this paper installed django and you need
05:24 - to run this command so next time we are
05:26 - going to work with Visual Studio code in
05:27 - with the integrated terminal so after
05:30 - opening your terminal what you need to
05:32 - do is move to desktop then move to the
05:38 - that folder CD programming knowledge so
05:42 - I am inside this folder and now I'm
05:45 - going to indict kamat so it shows me on
05:47 - hello door py file Albina and the fold
05:48 - of all notes are given there so what I
05:50 - need to do is Django admin start project
05:59 - this could be any project name you want
06:02 - to give in my project now I will try to
06:06 - run the directory command
06:08 - so this says my project as there is a
06:11 - folder called Mac reject which has been
06:13 - has been installed on in the current
06:15 - directory and this is due to disk one
06:17 - Django admin start project my project so
06:20 - oh yeah you can see that my project has
06:23 - been sold successfully now step up
06:25 - Django project has been created and then
06:29 - if you want to start a app so as I
06:33 - mentioned earlier the inside this there
06:36 - is a manager 3 by 5 so you can run this
06:40 - Alvia command line if you specify Python
06:44 - you as a prefix to this file name so in
06:47 - the same way we can run this manager py
06:49 - file by a command line if you use Python
06:51 - as a prefix so what I'm trying to say is
06:55 - like you move to the sorry you move to
06:59 - the inside the Django project folder
07:02 - which is my project name here CD my
07:05 - project now what you need to do is run
07:10 - the directory come on so there is a file
07:11 - called mandatory why you can run this
07:14 - file if Python managed dot py so you are
07:19 - able to run this file but any addition
07:22 - to this this i'm also specify something
07:25 - start app I knew it could be my app so
07:30 - let me clear one thing here yeah so it's
07:33 - a bit so first I created oh I I was
07:37 - inside my programming all the territory
07:39 - then I created a folder called my
07:41 - project so this is a Django project so
07:44 - inside a Django project I created an act
07:47 - which I specific like this Python
07:50 - Meritor P by inside the project folder
07:53 - I'm trying to create an app with the
07:56 - name my app I want to tell you one thing
07:58 - that inside a Django project they can be
08:00 - multiple apps so or we can say like they
08:04 - can be multiple apps inside the single
08:05 - Django project okay so like by using
08:08 - this command we are going to create an
08:10 - app so I would say Python manage what py
08:12 - start up my hat so when I move to my
08:16 - older I would say my app so the my app
08:20 - has been created inside my my project
08:22 - folder in the same way I can do one
08:24 - thing extra I can do my app to oh so
08:31 - this also works so like what I told you
08:33 - that inside my Django project single
08:36 - Django project i have created two acts
08:38 - one is my panel it is my act 2
08:42 - so what I wanted to tell you with an
08:43 - inside a single Django code you can
08:45 - create multiple apps so far we have
08:48 - moved to this now in the last one what
08:50 - you are going to run if you want to run
08:52 - the Django serve on our local
08:53 - she what you need to do is you should be
08:57 - inside your project folder and type
08:58 - Python manage dot py run server so so
09:12 - this says Django version 3.0 point point
09:15 - using settings my project of setting
09:17 - starting there put some we'll add this
09:18 - and this is 127 point 0.0 0.1 and this
09:23 - is the 8000 is port number so I want to
09:25 - tell you that this is your localhost
09:27 - address till 127 0.0 0.0 0.1 and 8000 is
09:31 - your port number so either you can copy
09:33 - this address or you can one simply do
09:36 - one thing since one point descent point
09:38 - oh point 0.01 is your localhost address
09:40 - what you can type is simply type local
09:42 - host and specify the port number and
09:45 - port number was 8000 so this would okay
09:49 - now you can see the this page is being
09:53 - loaded here so what we can do we can
09:55 - quit the server with the control breaks
09:57 - break come on I think this is any issues
10:00 - with this I would again
10:07 - learn this come on okay so this shows
10:10 - that this has been now it has been
10:12 - started on one machine so like so now
10:15 - they says so this is the so you have to
10:17 - use this command fight managed or py run
10:20 - server so this has I started the server
10:23 - on my local machine with the address 127
10:26 - point 0.0 point 1 : 8000 so this means
10:29 - that that address was localhost and the
10:31 - port number was of state thousands I had
10:33 - simply type localhost colon colon 8000
10:37 - the server is running successfully so
10:39 - the install work successfully
10:41 - congratulations so this you from here
10:44 - you can refer to django documentation
10:45 - tutorial a polling app django community
10:48 - so till now we made a django surfer on a
10:50 - machine me and we were able to run that
10:52 - django server or machine so next were we
10:55 - will cover with the request and the
10:56 - response part the thank you so many
10:58 - times
11:01 - you

like you have covered the a and the B part and in the third third part we are going to see Stefon soul jangle so what you can do is open your come online I would recommend you to run this come on pip pip is and piping base package manager so it helps you to install packages and likes libraries externally a why combined I'm so what you need to type is pip install Django so this would install Django

simply do one thing since one point descent point oh point 0.01 is your localhost address what you can type is simply type local host and specify the port number and port number was 8000 so this would okay now you can see the this page is being loaded here so what we can do we can quit the server with the control breaks break come on I think this is any issues with this I would again learn this come on okay so this shows that this has been now it has been started on one machine so like so now they says so this is the so you have to use this command fight managed or py run server so this has I started the server on my local machine with the address 127 point 0.0 point 1 8000 so this means that that address was localhost and the port number was of state thousands I had simply type localhost colon colon 8000 the server is running successfully so the install work successfully congratulations so this you from here you can refer to django documentation tutorial a polling app django community so till now we made a django surfer on a machine me and we were able to run that django server or machine so next were we will cover with the request and the response part the thank you so many times you
