00:32 - to download so this file I want to
00:34 - download and I have the URL of the file
00:38 - which is program knowledge. g/ images.
00:43 - header
00:45 - image.png so I will copy the path of
00:48 - this file and go to my project and now I
00:51 - will double click this button and in
00:53 - here I will write my
00:57 - DOT computer do dot Network do download
01:03 - file and in the bracket I will pass two
01:07 - argument first is the URL of the file
01:10 - which I have just copied so I will just
01:13 - give this double codes and copy the path
01:15 - of the file and second is

01:59 - when you copy the path these backward
02:03 - slashes should be forward slashes so
02:06 - just change these backward slash to the
02:08 - forward slash otherwise it should not
02:12 - take the right path so just go to Every
02:16 - backward slash and convert it to the

02:20 - slash okay so now this program is
02:25 - complete just take two argument one is
02:28 - the URL and second is the name of the
