00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to explain you something
00:05 - about increment operator and assignment
00:08 - operator so let's get started first of
00:12 - all I will explain you how assignment
00:14 - operation
00:16 - works so let's take an example I will
00:19 - declare an integer X is equal to
00:26 - 25 and I'm going to print it very simple
00:29 - Stu
00:35 - thanks okay now for example I want to
00:39 - add to uh this value add some more value
00:44 - to this value I have shown you that you
00:47 - can do it like this x is = to
00:51 - x + 5 for example and what it will do is
00:57 - it will take the value of x and add five
01:01 - to it and place it into X once again
01:05 - right so let's build it and run it and
01:08 - it will show us 30 but the more
01:11 - efficient way to do this is because you
01:15 - are using x two times you can just
01:19 - reduce
01:20 - this by writing it something like this
01:25 - okay so X+ is equal to 5 it will just
01:28 - serve the same purpose as before it will
01:32 - add five to
01:34 - our variable which is X and then save it
01:38 - into the same variable once again I will
01:42 - run the program and answer is same and
01:46 - you can do this assignment operation
01:49 - with multiplication subtraction division
01:52 - or you can take a modulus so I will show
01:55 - you one by one first of all minus so
01:58 - what it will do is is it'll take X and
02:02 - subtract five from it and it will show
02:04 - the result it will save the result in
02:06 - this X and it will show the result here
02:08 - right
02:10 - so run the program and it shows 20 same
02:14 - is with product or multiplication you
02:17 - just give estx it will multiply 25 by
02:22 - 5 just run the program and you see
02:26 - 125 and you can do it with the division
02:29 - also so but remember it doesn't show the
02:33 - remainder only the multiplication value
02:36 - or multiple value right so in this case
02:40 - it will show five because we don't have
02:42 - any remainder but if
02:44 - you divide 25 by 4 it will
02:48 - still let's see what it gives us
02:52 - six and it doesn't show us the remainder
02:55 - in order to show the remainder you need
02:57 - to give this module sign and then then
02:59 - it will just show you the remainder
03:02 - which is one right so it shows the
03:04 - remainder
03:05 - one now this is about assignment
03:10 - operation now I have also told you about
03:13 - increment operation in the for Loop
03:16 - tutorial so for example you want to
03:20 - increment one or add one to the variable
03:26 - X then you can do it like this X Plus
03:29 - plus and what it will do it will add one
03:33 - to our variable X and print it here
03:37 - right now let me show you a phenomena of
03:42 - for how you can use this in two
03:46 - different ways so what I'm going to do
03:49 - is I'm just going to copy this and paste
03:52 - it here once again and what I'm going to
03:55 - do is I
03:57 - will increment X by one here just delete
04:02 - this and then I will show the value of x
04:06 - right and both I'm printing let's see
04:10 - what
04:11 - happens and you see what's happening
04:15 - here is it's even though we are
04:18 - increasing the value of x by one but
04:22 - it's showing 25 first and then
04:25 - 26 so this phenomena is uh happening
04:30 - because we are adding this Plus+ after
04:34 - our X okay so what will happen is it
04:38 - will your C++ code will print the value
04:43 - of x first and then add one to it and
04:47 - then when you print x to the second time
04:50 - it will show the add addition value so
04:54 - 26 it will show here but for example you
04:58 - want to add
05:01 - one or add this one before showing the
05:04 - value what what you need to do is you
05:07 - just need to add this Plus+ before this
05:11 - x now it will what it will do is it will
05:15 - add 1 2x first and then print this value
05:20 - and this will be the same so let's see
05:23 - what happens
05:25 - now
05:26 - just close our program
05:30 - and build
05:32 - it run it and you can see now this is
05:36 - 2626 so it takes the value of x
05:39 - increment it and then prints it this is
05:42 - the difference between
05:45 - this prefix of++ and trailing Plus+
05:49 - right so just remember if you want to
05:53 - increment the value first add these
05:56 - Plus+ in the front and if you want to
05:59 - increase increment the value after
06:01 - showing uh the value then you just add
06:06 - it after Plus+ same rule
06:11 - will be true for minus so when
06:15 - you do this XX xus minus here and when
06:20 - you run the
06:21 - program it'll still show you the value
06:24 - 25 because the subtraction is not
06:27 - happened here but it it's happened after
06:32 - the execution of this so in the next
06:34 - line then you can see 24 in the next
06:38 - line and when you add this minus minus
06:41 - in
06:43 - front then your value is subtracted
06:47 - first so one is subtracted from the X
06:51 - and then it prints 24 and then 24 so
06:54 - this is all
06:55 - about all the basics about assignment
06:59 - operator an increment operator I hope
07:01 - you understood the concept please wrate
07:03 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome once again in this video I'm going to explain you something about increment operator and assignment operator so let's get started first of all I will explain you how assignment operation works so let's take an example I will declare an integer X is equal to 25 and I'm going to print it very simple Stu thanks okay now for example I want to add to uh this value add some more value to this value I have shown you that you can do it like this x is = to x + 5 for example and what it will do is it will take the value of x and add five to it and place it into X once again right so let's build it and run it and it will show us 30 but the more efficient way to do this is because you are using x two times you can just reduce this by writing it something like this okay so X+ is equal to 5 it will just serve the same purpose as before it will add five to our variable which is X and then save it into the same variable once again I will run the program and answer is same and you can do this assignment operation with multiplication subtraction division or you can take a modulus so I will show you one by one first of all minus so what it will do is is it'll take X and subtract five from it and it will show the result it will save the result in this X and it will show the result here right so run the program and it shows 20 same is with product or multiplication you just give estx it will multiply 25 by 5 just run the program and you see 125 and you can do it with the division also so but remember it doesn't show the remainder only the multiplication value or multiple value right so in this case it will show five because we don't have any remainder but if you divide 25 by 4 it will still let's see what it gives us six and it doesn't show us the remainder in order to show the remainder you need to give this module sign and then then it will just show you the remainder which is one right so it shows the remainder one now this is about assignment operation now I have also told you about increment operation in the for Loop tutorial so for example you want to increment one or add one to the variable X then you can do it like this X Plus plus and what it will do it will add one to our variable X and print it here right now let me show you a phenomena of for how you can use this in two different ways so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this and paste it here once again and what I'm going to do is I will increment X by one here just delete this and then I will show the value of x right and both I'm printing let's see what happens and you see what's happening here is it's even though we are increasing the value of x by one but it's showing 25 first and then 26 so this phenomena is uh happening because we are adding this Plus+ after our X okay so what will happen is it will your C++ code will print the value of x first and then add one to it and then when you print x to the second time it will show the add addition value so 26 it will show here but for example you want to add one or add this one before showing the value what what you need to do is you just need to add this Plus+ before this x now it will what it will do is it will add 1 2x first and then print this value and this will be the same so let's see what happens now just close our program and build it run it and you can see now this is 2626 so it takes the value of x increment it and then prints it this is the difference between this prefix of++ and trailing Plus+ right so just remember if you want to increment the value first add these Plus+ in the front and if you want to increase increment the value after showing uh the value then you just add it after Plus+ same rule will be true for minus so when you do this XX xus minus here and when you run the program it'll still show you the value 25 because the subtraction is not happened here but it it's happened after the execution of this so in the next line then you can see 24 in the next line and when you add this minus minus in front then your value is subtracted first so one is subtracted from the X and then it prints 24 and then 24 so this is all about all the basics about assignment operator an increment operator I hope you understood the concept please wrate comment and subscribe and bye for now
