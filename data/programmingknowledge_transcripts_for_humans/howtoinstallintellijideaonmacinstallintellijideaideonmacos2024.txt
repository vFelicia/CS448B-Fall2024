00:45 - you just need to uh go to your favorite
00:47 - browser and search for download intellig
00:50 - idea and the first link which will
00:52 - appear here will be from jet brains

01:15 - version of intellig idea
01:18 - IDE now here under Community version you
01:22 - will see DMG uh version so this jet
01:26 - brains website has recognized that uh we

01:50 - have Intel processors in it then use the
01:53 - first one if you are using the MacBook
01:56 - which have M1 or M2 chips then then you
02:00 - can use the DMG Apple silicon version so
02:04 - I'm going to choose the Apple silicon
02:06 - version because I have the M2 version of
02:10 - uh Macbook so once I click on this
02:12 - download button this uh intellig idea
02:15 - DMG file will be downloaded so I'm going
02:17 - to click on this DMG file and let me
02:20 - minimize the browser here so this is the

02:47 - this plus green sign so so just hover
02:50 - this uh intelligent idea icon on the
02:52 - applications folder until you see this
02:54 - plus green button and then drop it into
02:58 - the applications folder
03:00 - once you drop it on the applications
03:02 - folder this intelligent idea app is
03:05 - copied into the applications folder and
03:08 - once that's done you can go to your
03:11 - Launchpad and you will see this
03:13 - intelligent idea C uh icon here so you
03:17 - can open the intellig idea IDE from here
03:21 - or you can uh go to your applications
03:24 - folder in the finder and you will find
03:27 - this intelligent idea IDE uh icon there
03:31 - also so the installation of intelligent
03:33 - idea is finished so let's start the
03:36 - intelligent idea IDE by clicking on this
03:39 - uh icon and now the intellig idea uh IDE
03:43 - has been started so for the first time
03:45 - when it start it'll show you this kind
03:48 - of license terms and conditions just
03:50 - check this checkbox which says I
03:51 - confirmed that and then click on
03:54 - continue and then uh in the next window
03:57 - it says data sharing I don't want to
03:59 - share any data with jet brains so I will
04:02 - just uh click on don't send and you can
04:05 - see the intellig idea IDE has been
04:08 - started so here you will see few
04:10 - sections where you can create new
04:13 - projects under project section you can
04:16 - also customize your intellig idea IDE so
04:20 - right now there is a dark theme if you
04:22 - want to have the light theme you can
04:24 - also choose this light theme or this
04:27 - light with the lighter header theme
04:30 - also you can uh choose the IDE font
04:35 - which is 13 for now and then the key map
04:39 - is for Mac OS which is okay so let me
04:41 - choose the dark version and then you
04:45 - also have the option to install plugins
04:48 - for different uh languages and different
04:52 - tools for example the support of Scala
04:54 - is available or idea whm is available
04:58 - and all these other tools right and then
05:01 - if you want to learn then you can also
05:04 - learn about intellig idea using this
05:07 - learn section let's create a project so
05:09 - I will uh select the project section and
05:12 - then click on new
05:14 - project and then I need to give the name
05:17 - to my project so I will name my project
05:20 - as demo Java project and the location is
05:24 - under idea projects which is under your
05:27 - home folder so if if you don't have the
05:30 - good reason to change this just leave it
05:32 - as default then you can also choose the
05:35 - language I will choose the Java language
05:37 - and then you can choose the build system
05:40 - for now I will leave it as intellig uh
05:43 - build system you can also choose between
05:46 - MAV and gradal but for now just for demo
05:49 - I will choose the intellig build system
05:52 - and then the jdk is jdk
05:56 - 2.0.1 in my case because I have
05:58 - installed this version of of uh Java
06:01 - jdk also it says add sample code and
06:05 - generate code with onboarding tips right
06:08 - so if you leave these checkboxes as
06:10 - checked it's going to uh add the sample
06:13 - code in your project which I want so I
06:16 - will just click on uh create which is
06:19 - going to create my Java project and you
06:23 - can see this jet demo Java project is
06:25 - created here I have the source folder
06:28 - and then I have this main class under
06:30 - Source folder here I have the sample
06:34 - program under the public static void
06:37 - Main and it says
06:39 - system.out.print F hello and welcome so
06:43 - it's going to print hello and welcome
06:45 - and also it's going to print these
06:48 - numbers now it also have added the
06:52 - instructions so to run the code press
06:55 - press this key combination or click on
06:58 - the run Icon which is this icon here and
07:03 - also if you want to add the break points
07:05 - you can see one breakpoint is already
07:08 - added you can also add multiple break
07:11 - points here but uh that we can do later
07:14 - so in order to run the program you
07:19 - simply need to click on this run button
07:22 - if you want to build this program just
07:24 - build project by going on the build and
07:27 - then click on build project and then you
07:30 - can also run the main. Java file for now
07:33 - I'm going to click on this run button it
07:35 - says run main. Java it's going to build
07:39 - my program and it's going to run my
07:41 - program and what it does it prints hello
07:45 - and welcome and then it prints the I is
07:49 - equal to the numbers from 1 to 5 which
07:53 - is what this program is doing right
07:56 - now so it's that simp simple to install
08:00 - and run your Java project inside your
08:03 - intellig ID IDE and that's it for this
08:06 - video so this is how you can download
08:08 - and install intellig ID IDE on your Mac
08:11 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
