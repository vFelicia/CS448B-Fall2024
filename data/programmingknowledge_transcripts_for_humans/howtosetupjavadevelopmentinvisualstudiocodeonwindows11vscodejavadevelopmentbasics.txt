00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set up visual studio
00:04 - code for java development on your
00:07 - windows 11 operating system so for
00:09 - developing java on visual studio code
00:11 - you need two things first thing is java
00:14 - jdk which should be installed on your
00:17 - windows 11 operating system
00:19 - and the other thing is visual studio
00:21 - code editor so if you don't know how to
00:23 - install java jdk on your windows
00:25 - operating system then i will provide the
00:28 - link in the description of this video
00:30 - and you can watch that video and see how
00:32 - we can install java jdk same goes for
00:36 - visual studio code so if you don't know
00:37 - how to install visual studio code just
00:40 - click the link in the description of
00:41 - this video and you will be good to go so
00:44 - after installing visual studio code and
00:47 - java jdk on your windows 11 operating
00:50 - system there is one more thing which you
00:53 - will require in order to develop
00:55 - java programs on visual studio code and
00:58 - that is the java support for your visual
01:02 - studio code
01:03 - so for that you can open your browser
01:06 - once again
01:07 - and then search for visual studio code
01:09 - java
01:11 - and you will see the first link which
01:13 - will appear here which will be from
01:15 - code.visualstudio.com
01:17 - so i'm going to click on this link
01:20 - and i'm going to put this link in the
01:22 - description of this video also so the
01:24 - most important step here is when you
01:27 - scroll down
01:29 - you need to install this
01:31 - package which is called install the
01:34 - coding pack for java on windows so in
01:37 - order to fast track the process of java
01:40 - development on visual studio code visual
01:42 - studio code team has itself created
01:46 - this
01:47 - pack for java which you can install on
01:49 - your windows operating system or on your
01:52 - mac operating system and this will help
01:55 - you to develop java
01:57 - programs on your windows 11 operating
02:00 - system so now i'm going to click on this
02:02 - button which says install coding pack
02:04 - for java which is also going to
02:07 - download this exe file you can also read
02:11 - this description which says to help you
02:13 - set up we recommend you to use the
02:15 - coding pack for java which is the bundle
02:18 - of vs code the java development kit so
02:21 - now this exe file is downloaded for the
02:24 - java pack so i'm going to click on this
02:25 - exe file and let me minimize my browser
02:28 - and now you can see this
02:30 - install coding pack for java setup has
02:33 - been started so first step is to accept
02:35 - the license terms and conditions click
02:38 - on next here
02:39 - and then just verify everything you can
02:42 - see i have already
02:44 - installed java development kit 17 on my
02:48 - windows operating system and i already
02:50 - have the installation of visual studio
02:53 - code so this pack is going to detect if
02:55 - you have already have the java jdk
02:58 - installation and visual studio code
03:00 - installation so in the next step you
03:02 - just need to click on the install button
03:04 - which is going to start the installation
03:06 - of this coding pack for java so once
03:09 - this coding pack is installed you can
03:12 - see this message which says completing
03:14 - the setup
03:15 - just leave this checkbox as checked and
03:17 - then click on finish which is going to
03:19 - launch
03:20 - visual studio code on your windows
03:23 - operating system
03:25 - so now a visual studio code has been
03:27 - started with the java support
03:30 - you might be able to uh just check all
03:33 - the java related extensions here when
03:36 - you click on the extension
03:38 - icon here
03:39 - you will be able to see so when you
03:42 - click on extension pack for java it's
03:44 - already installed debugger for java it's
03:47 - also installed
03:49 - maven for java it's also installed so
03:51 - all the extensions which you will
03:53 - require to develop java
03:56 - programs on your visual studio code
03:58 - editor you will see the list of all the
04:02 - extensions here so now we are ready to
04:04 - develop some java code right so let me
04:07 - start from the very beginning so let's
04:10 - say you want to create
04:11 - your first java program in visual studio
04:14 - code so what i'm going to do here is i'm
04:16 - going to just to open the command prompt
04:19 - i will just write cmd
04:22 - and here i'm going to create a new
04:24 - directory so first of all let's say i
04:26 - want to create this project folder on
04:30 - the desktop so i will just cd to the
04:33 - desktop directory and here i can create
04:36 - a folder
04:37 - using the command mkdir you can right
04:39 - click on the desktop and create the
04:41 - folder also i'm going to name my folder
04:44 - as a sample and then press enter
04:47 - and you will see the sample project has
04:49 - been created so let me
04:51 - go inside
04:52 - that folder so just
04:55 - type cd
04:56 - sample here and then press enter and now
04:59 - you are inside the sample directory
05:01 - right
05:02 - here you can write code space dot and
05:05 - then press enter which is going to open
05:09 - this sample folder in visual studio code
05:12 - directly right
05:14 - if you don't want to use the command
05:17 - line just do it everything using this
05:20 - gui
05:22 - and then go inside the project folder
05:25 - right now it's empty you can right click
05:27 - here and then click on show more options
05:29 - and then click on open with code
05:32 - which is also going to open the same
05:34 - folder in your visual studio code so
05:38 - let's say i want to create a very simple
05:41 - hello world java program here
05:43 - i can create a java file using this icon
05:47 - or using file and then new file or i can
05:51 - simply right click here and then click
05:53 - on new file here
05:55 - so i'm going to name my file as hello
05:58 - dot
05:59 - java
06:01 - and once i do that i will just press
06:04 - enter and once you create this file you
06:07 - can see visual studio code is going to
06:10 - automatically
06:12 - detect the
06:13 - file extension
06:15 - and you will be able to see this
06:17 - language here
06:19 - you can also see projects are imported
06:21 - into workspace
06:23 - so let me just uh create a very simple
06:27 - hello class in this
06:28 - hello.java file so i'm going to just
06:31 - type
06:32 - class here and you can see visual studio
06:34 - code is going to detect that you are
06:37 - trying to create a class in this
06:39 - hello.java file
06:41 - and when you uh just select the second
06:43 - option here
06:44 - you can see visual studio code has
06:47 - automatically created
06:49 - this
06:50 - hello class for me now in order to
06:52 - create a main method inside this hello
06:55 - class i can just type main here and once
06:59 - again visual studio code is going to
07:01 - show you intellisense and show you all
07:04 - these options
07:05 - and it has detected that i want to
07:08 - create the main
07:09 - method inside this class
07:11 - and i'm going to just select the first
07:13 - option here which is going to
07:16 - create the main method inside this hello
07:19 - class from me automatically so how
07:21 - simple this is right
07:23 - now let's say i want to just type hello
07:26 - world i can just write
07:28 - system
07:29 - dot
07:30 - out
07:31 - dot
07:32 - print line and at every step you will be
07:35 - able to see this intellisense
07:37 - so i will be able to
07:39 - complete my code
07:41 - faster
07:42 - and then let me just
07:44 - uh print hello
07:46 - world here and it's that simple to
07:49 - create your first hello world java
07:52 - uh program right now how you can run
07:54 - your java programs so you for that you
07:57 - have few options here
07:59 - the obvious one is this one which is
08:02 - this run button and it's going to run
08:04 - your java program the second option is
08:06 - to just right click on
08:09 - your
08:10 - java file and when you scroll down and
08:12 - you will be able to see this run java
08:14 - option and the bug java option so you
08:17 - can use these two options to run and
08:19 - debug your java program or you will see
08:24 - this
08:25 - option here on the top of your main
08:28 - method run or debug so you can also use
08:32 - one of these options to run
08:34 - your program or
08:36 - debug your program you also have this
08:39 - run option here
08:40 - and it's going to allow you to start
08:42 - debugging and
08:45 - all the other options related to
08:46 - debugging are available here also
08:49 - so let's run our program so i'm going to
08:51 - just click on this run button which is
08:54 - going to compile our java program and
08:56 - for the first time it's going to show me
08:59 - this warning i'm going to just click on
09:01 - allow access and you can see
09:04 - visual studio code has already compiled
09:06 - our code and ran our code and the output
09:10 - is printed here now let's say you forgot
09:12 - to type the semicolon here visual studio
09:15 - code is going to show you this red error
09:18 - and it's also going to show you what can
09:20 - be this error so it's you see
09:22 - it's a syntax error and we need to
09:25 - insert the semicolon at the last right
09:28 - so
09:29 - it's going to help you to detect the
09:32 - errors in your java code also now let's
09:35 - say you have written the wrong code
09:37 - which will not compile but then also you
09:41 - want to just uh
09:43 - compile it then
09:44 - you will see this error here in the
09:47 - problems tab and you will see the
09:50 - details of the error here right so
09:53 - the exact line number on which the error
09:56 - is coming
09:57 - and
09:58 - when you click on this error it's going
10:00 - to just redirect you to the particular
10:03 - line from which the error is coming
10:06 - so this is how you can detect the errors
10:09 - and fix them
10:11 - also let's try to debug our code so you
10:14 - can
10:15 - click on this debug
10:16 - option here or you can click on this
10:20 - debug icon here on the left hand side
10:24 - and then
10:25 - you can click on run and debug option
10:28 - so i'm going to click on run and debug
10:30 - which is going to start the java
10:32 - debugger
10:33 - and because i haven't
10:35 - added any breakpoint
10:37 - my debugger has ran successfully and it
10:41 - has printed hello world
10:43 - let's say i will just add a break point
10:45 - here
10:46 - all my break points i will be able to
10:48 - see here under break points so i can add
10:52 - multiple break points uh in my code
10:55 - using these
10:56 - red dots and i can keep the track of all
10:59 - the break points
11:00 - under this
11:01 - breakpoints
11:03 - section
11:04 - i can disable all the breakpoint at once
11:07 - using this toggle
11:09 - active breakpoint
11:10 - button which is going to deactivate all
11:12 - the breakpoints
11:14 - if i want to remove all the breakpoints
11:17 - then i can just click on this icon which
11:19 - is going to remove all the breakpoints
11:21 - right
11:22 - let's say i have just added the
11:24 - breakpoint here
11:26 - and then ran the debugger once again
11:30 - this time you can see the execution of
11:32 - my code
11:34 - has been stopped on
11:36 - the breakpoint
11:37 - and i will be able to see
11:39 - the argument values here and then i have
11:43 - all these options so i can
11:46 - continue using this button i can step
11:49 - over to the next line i can step into a
11:53 - method or i can step out from a method
11:57 - i can also restart my debugger stop my
12:00 - debugger
12:01 - and this option is for hot code replace
12:05 - option right
12:07 - so i have all these
12:09 - options here so now let me just stop
12:12 - this uh debugging from here and let me
12:14 - add some
12:15 - codes so let's say i just declared
12:18 - two number num1 which will be equal to
12:22 - five let's say and then
12:25 - i'm going to declare a second variable
12:27 - which is called num2
12:30 - and the value of it is 10 let's say
12:32 - right and i'm going to
12:34 - create a third
12:37 - variable which will be called let's say
12:40 - sum here
12:41 - and it will be the sum of num1 plus
12:45 - num
12:46 - 2 right
12:48 - so you will be able to see at each and
12:50 - every point visual studio code is going
12:53 - to show us hint and intellisense to
12:56 - complete our code faster
12:58 - and now i want to just print the value
13:00 - of sum here right
13:02 - and now i have
13:05 - more debugging possibilities
13:07 - and let me just start the debugger once
13:10 - again i have added three break points
13:12 - here
13:13 - and here you can see
13:16 - that i will be able to keep the track of
13:19 - all the local variables here i can also
13:21 - watch for some variables here for
13:24 - example i want to watch for a variable
13:26 - called sum i can just add that but the
13:29 - program execution is still not there so
13:33 - right now cannot evaluate
13:35 - because of the compilation error right
13:38 - so let's uh step over to the next line
13:41 - you can see the value 5 is assigned to
13:44 - variable num1
13:46 - step over once again now
13:49 - num 2 has 10
13:50 - and then step over once again now we
13:53 - have the sum which is equal to 15 and
13:56 - this variable we were watching right so
14:00 - it was in our watch list so now it shows
14:03 - the value right so
14:05 - you can see the
14:06 - global and local variable lists here you
14:09 - can watch for some variables
14:12 - and you have the track of all these
14:16 - break points here right
14:18 - so this is how
14:19 - you can debug your java code on your
14:23 - visual studio code also have the
14:25 - possibility so let me just stop this
14:29 - debugger so you also have the
14:30 - possibility to create a launch.json file
14:34 - and here you can provide the
14:36 - configuration related to debugging
14:40 - on
14:40 - this
14:41 - launch.json file so you can click on
14:44 - this create a launch dot json file so
14:46 - just click on this launch dot json file
14:49 - which is going to create this
14:51 - launch.json file and you can see
14:53 - all the configuration related to
14:56 - the java debugging and when you click on
14:59 - the explorer option you will be able to
15:01 - see this dot vs code folder is created
15:05 - and under that you have this launch dot
15:07 - json file
15:09 - so this is good when you are just
15:13 - creating your program and then
15:15 - just pushing it to some github
15:17 - repository and then somebody else will
15:20 - be able to take your
15:22 - launch configuration and he will be able
15:24 - to use
15:25 - it for debugging your java program right
15:29 - you also have this github versioning for
15:33 - your source code
15:35 - so when you have git installed visual
15:38 - studio code is going to track all the
15:40 - changes which you make on your project
15:43 - in your java files and it will allow you
15:46 - to commit or push your code or pull
15:49 - some repository from github or any other
15:53 - repository
15:54 - right
15:55 - you can also search for some code using
15:57 - the search option
15:59 - and
16:00 - if
16:00 - these extensions are not enough you can
16:03 - search
16:04 - more java related
16:06 - extensions by just typing java and then
16:09 - you will be able to find more java
16:11 - related extensions here so you can
16:13 - install them and use them for
16:16 - developing different java
16:19 - frameworks so let's say i want to add
16:21 - the support for spring so i can just
16:24 - install this
16:25 - extension and then develop spring based
16:28 - app
16:29 - in my visual studio code editor so this
16:32 - is how you can set up and use java in
16:35 - your visual studio code editor i hope
16:37 - you enjoyed this video and i will see
16:39 - you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can set up visual studio code for java development on your windows 11 operating system so for developing java on visual studio code you need two things first thing is java jdk which should be installed on your windows 11 operating system and the other thing is visual studio code editor so if you don't know how to install java jdk on your windows operating system then i will provide the link in the description of this video and you can watch that video and see how we can install java jdk same goes for visual studio code so if you don't know how to install visual studio code just click the link in the description of this video and you will be good to go so after installing visual studio code and java jdk on your windows 11 operating system there is one more thing which you will require in order to develop java programs on visual studio code and that is the java support for your visual studio code so for that you can open your browser once again and then search for visual studio code java and you will see the first link which will appear here which will be from code.visualstudio.com so i'm going to click on this link and i'm going to put this link in the description of this video also so the most important step here is when you scroll down you need to install this package which is called install the coding pack for java on windows so in order to fast track the process of java development on visual studio code visual studio code team has itself created this pack for java which you can install on your windows operating system or on your mac operating system and this will help you to develop java programs on your windows 11 operating system so now i'm going to click on this button which says install coding pack for java which is also going to download this exe file you can also read this description which says to help you set up we recommend you to use the coding pack for java which is the bundle of vs code the java development kit so now this exe file is downloaded for the java pack so i'm going to click on this exe file and let me minimize my browser and now you can see this install coding pack for java setup has been started so first step is to accept the license terms and conditions click on next here and then just verify everything you can see i have already installed java development kit 17 on my windows operating system and i already have the installation of visual studio code so this pack is going to detect if you have already have the java jdk installation and visual studio code installation so in the next step you just need to click on the install button which is going to start the installation of this coding pack for java so once this coding pack is installed you can see this message which says completing the setup just leave this checkbox as checked and then click on finish which is going to launch visual studio code on your windows operating system so now a visual studio code has been started with the java support you might be able to uh just check all the java related extensions here when you click on the extension icon here you will be able to see so when you click on extension pack for java it's already installed debugger for java it's also installed maven for java it's also installed so all the extensions which you will require to develop java programs on your visual studio code editor you will see the list of all the extensions here so now we are ready to develop some java code right so let me start from the very beginning so let's say you want to create your first java program in visual studio code so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to just to open the command prompt i will just write cmd and here i'm going to create a new directory so first of all let's say i want to create this project folder on the desktop so i will just cd to the desktop directory and here i can create a folder using the command mkdir you can right click on the desktop and create the folder also i'm going to name my folder as a sample and then press enter and you will see the sample project has been created so let me go inside that folder so just type cd sample here and then press enter and now you are inside the sample directory right here you can write code space dot and then press enter which is going to open this sample folder in visual studio code directly right if you don't want to use the command line just do it everything using this gui and then go inside the project folder right now it's empty you can right click here and then click on show more options and then click on open with code which is also going to open the same folder in your visual studio code so let's say i want to create a very simple hello world java program here i can create a java file using this icon or using file and then new file or i can simply right click here and then click on new file here so i'm going to name my file as hello dot java and once i do that i will just press enter and once you create this file you can see visual studio code is going to automatically detect the file extension and you will be able to see this language here you can also see projects are imported into workspace so let me just uh create a very simple hello class in this hello.java file so i'm going to just type class here and you can see visual studio code is going to detect that you are trying to create a class in this hello.java file and when you uh just select the second option here you can see visual studio code has automatically created this hello class for me now in order to create a main method inside this hello class i can just type main here and once again visual studio code is going to show you intellisense and show you all these options and it has detected that i want to create the main method inside this class and i'm going to just select the first option here which is going to create the main method inside this hello class from me automatically so how simple this is right now let's say i want to just type hello world i can just write system dot out dot print line and at every step you will be able to see this intellisense so i will be able to complete my code faster and then let me just uh print hello world here and it's that simple to create your first hello world java uh program right now how you can run your java programs so you for that you have few options here the obvious one is this one which is this run button and it's going to run your java program the second option is to just right click on your java file and when you scroll down and you will be able to see this run java option and the bug java option so you can use these two options to run and debug your java program or you will see this option here on the top of your main method run or debug so you can also use one of these options to run your program or debug your program you also have this run option here and it's going to allow you to start debugging and all the other options related to debugging are available here also so let's run our program so i'm going to just click on this run button which is going to compile our java program and for the first time it's going to show me this warning i'm going to just click on allow access and you can see visual studio code has already compiled our code and ran our code and the output is printed here now let's say you forgot to type the semicolon here visual studio code is going to show you this red error and it's also going to show you what can be this error so it's you see it's a syntax error and we need to insert the semicolon at the last right so it's going to help you to detect the errors in your java code also now let's say you have written the wrong code which will not compile but then also you want to just uh compile it then you will see this error here in the problems tab and you will see the details of the error here right so the exact line number on which the error is coming and when you click on this error it's going to just redirect you to the particular line from which the error is coming so this is how you can detect the errors and fix them also let's try to debug our code so you can click on this debug option here or you can click on this debug icon here on the left hand side and then you can click on run and debug option so i'm going to click on run and debug which is going to start the java debugger and because i haven't added any breakpoint my debugger has ran successfully and it has printed hello world let's say i will just add a break point here all my break points i will be able to see here under break points so i can add multiple break points uh in my code using these red dots and i can keep the track of all the break points under this breakpoints section i can disable all the breakpoint at once using this toggle active breakpoint button which is going to deactivate all the breakpoints if i want to remove all the breakpoints then i can just click on this icon which is going to remove all the breakpoints right let's say i have just added the breakpoint here and then ran the debugger once again this time you can see the execution of my code has been stopped on the breakpoint and i will be able to see the argument values here and then i have all these options so i can continue using this button i can step over to the next line i can step into a method or i can step out from a method i can also restart my debugger stop my debugger and this option is for hot code replace option right so i have all these options here so now let me just stop this uh debugging from here and let me add some codes so let's say i just declared two number num1 which will be equal to five let's say and then i'm going to declare a second variable which is called num2 and the value of it is 10 let's say right and i'm going to create a third variable which will be called let's say sum here and it will be the sum of num1 plus num 2 right so you will be able to see at each and every point visual studio code is going to show us hint and intellisense to complete our code faster and now i want to just print the value of sum here right and now i have more debugging possibilities and let me just start the debugger once again i have added three break points here and here you can see that i will be able to keep the track of all the local variables here i can also watch for some variables here for example i want to watch for a variable called sum i can just add that but the program execution is still not there so right now cannot evaluate because of the compilation error right so let's uh step over to the next line you can see the value 5 is assigned to variable num1 step over once again now num 2 has 10 and then step over once again now we have the sum which is equal to 15 and this variable we were watching right so it was in our watch list so now it shows the value right so you can see the global and local variable lists here you can watch for some variables and you have the track of all these break points here right so this is how you can debug your java code on your visual studio code also have the possibility so let me just stop this debugger so you also have the possibility to create a launch.json file and here you can provide the configuration related to debugging on this launch.json file so you can click on this create a launch dot json file so just click on this launch dot json file which is going to create this launch.json file and you can see all the configuration related to the java debugging and when you click on the explorer option you will be able to see this dot vs code folder is created and under that you have this launch dot json file so this is good when you are just creating your program and then just pushing it to some github repository and then somebody else will be able to take your launch configuration and he will be able to use it for debugging your java program right you also have this github versioning for your source code so when you have git installed visual studio code is going to track all the changes which you make on your project in your java files and it will allow you to commit or push your code or pull some repository from github or any other repository right you can also search for some code using the search option and if these extensions are not enough you can search more java related extensions by just typing java and then you will be able to find more java related extensions here so you can install them and use them for developing different java frameworks so let's say i want to add the support for spring so i can just install this extension and then develop spring based app in my visual studio code editor so this is how you can set up and use java in your visual studio code editor i hope you enjoyed this video and i will see you in the next video
