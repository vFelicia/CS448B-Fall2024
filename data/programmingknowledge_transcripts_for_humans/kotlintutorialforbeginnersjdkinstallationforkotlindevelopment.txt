With timestamps:

00:00 - so in this in the previous video uh we
00:03 - have seen that we have to write code in
00:05 - kotlin and
00:06 - we have installed intellij idea
00:10 - but
00:10 - as i said
00:12 - we require
00:13 - just as just like we require uh sdk for
00:16 - android studio we require jdk for
00:19 - um
00:21 - intellij idea so what is jdk
00:24 - jdk or the java development kit is a
00:26 - cross platform software development
00:28 - environment does that offers a
00:30 - collection of tools and library is
00:32 - necessary for developing java based
00:34 - software
00:35 - application and applets so i'll explain
00:38 - in it basic words
00:39 - uh so i
00:41 - have given you an analogy for sdk if you
00:44 - remember
00:45 - like just like we
00:47 - need groceries
00:49 - so
00:50 - you can think of jdk or sdk as grocery
00:53 - store
00:55 - and you can think of the intellij idea
00:57 - or the ide
00:58 - as
00:59 - kitchen
01:00 - so we need groceries from the grocery
01:03 - store to prepare food in the kitchen
01:05 - similarly we need
01:07 - some libraries or some tools from the
01:10 - jdk or the sdk to prepare code in here
01:13 - to develop here to run a code in
01:17 - the ide
01:18 - okay so the jdk is one of the three core
01:21 - technology package used in java
01:23 - programming
01:25 - along with jvm and jre jvm is the java
01:28 - virtual machine jre is the java and time
01:30 - environment
01:32 - okay
01:33 - so the jvm
01:36 - is the java platform component that
01:38 - executes program
01:41 - okay so jvm
01:43 - is is the uh rupees player plays role in
01:46 - the execution of program the jre is the
01:50 - on disk part of java that creates the
01:52 - jvm
01:53 - okay so basically the jvm jre
01:56 - jvm is a part of jre
01:58 - and the jdk allows developer to create
02:00 - java programs that can be executive and
02:03 - run by the jvm and jre
02:06 - so he will be it will be more clear by
02:09 - this the jdk contains the gre and some
02:12 - development tools the gre contains the
02:15 - jvm and some library classes
02:17 - and the jvm
02:19 - uh
02:20 - executes the code
02:23 - the distinction between jdk and jre is
02:25 - that jdk is a package of tool for
02:27 - developing java based software whereas
02:29 - jre is a package of tool for running
02:32 - java code
02:34 - so the jdk is a tools for developing the
02:36 - java based
02:38 - software and jre is for running
02:41 - okay
02:42 - the jdk requires gre because running
02:45 - java program is a part of developing
02:46 - them so now we will be proceeding
02:49 - to install the
02:52 - jdk before installing the jdk
02:55 - go to this pc or my computer click on
02:58 - properties
03:00 - and we are just seeing if your operating
03:02 - system is a 64 bit or
03:04 - a 32-bit so my operating system is a
03:07 - 64-bit operating system if you are is
03:09 - yours is a 34 32-bit please note that
03:12 - now we will go to google
03:16 - and we'll type
03:19 - java
03:21 - sorry
03:22 - jdk
03:24 - for
03:25 - windows
03:27 - okay
03:28 - so we will click the link of java
03:30 - downloads by oracle
03:32 - and if you are using linux or mac os
03:35 - please download from here for windows
03:37 - user please go to windows tab and
03:40 - for 64 installer download the 64
03:43 - installer
03:44 - and here it is downloading
03:47 - so
03:49 - while
03:50 - that downloads for mac os user please
03:53 - download from here
03:55 - and for linux users
03:57 - install the
03:59 - jdk from here
04:01 - so as it is installed
04:04 - open the jdk
04:14 - click on yes
04:22 - wait for the installer to open
04:28 - click on next
04:30 - click on next
04:33 - and the
04:35 - java is installing on your
04:37 - device
04:39 - so now as java is installed successfully
04:42 - we have to close this
04:43 - close the uh
04:45 - close this also
04:47 - so now we what we have to do is
04:50 - we have to check where java is and on is
04:52 - in our system or not so what we'll do is
04:55 - we will go to the run and type cmd here
04:58 - okay and we will type the command java c
05:03 - so it is directly
05:05 - installed in my
05:07 - computer but if you are not seeing this
05:09 - if you are saying that it is not a
05:11 - recognizable command then what you what
05:13 - you do is
05:14 - you will go to this pc or my computer
05:18 - okay you will
05:20 - go to windows c
05:22 - you will go to the program files
05:25 - and find java in it
05:28 - click on the jdk
05:30 - click on the bin folder
05:32 - copy the path from here
05:34 - ctrl c click on the above part and ctrl
05:36 - c
05:37 - okay go to this pc again
05:41 - go to the properties
05:44 - and here go to advanced system settings
05:49 - in advanced system settings go to
05:50 - environment variables
05:53 - so
05:55 - if you are not seeing it
05:58 - it must be not in your environment
06:00 - variable so what you
06:03 - want to do is
06:05 - in the user variables click new and here
06:08 - create java and give the variable value
06:11 - this
06:12 - okay then click ok
06:14 - and then click ok and ok
06:17 - and now we will when will you when you
06:19 - will type
06:20 - in the cmd command java c
06:23 - then it will be showing this
06:26 - okay

Cleaned transcript:

so in this in the previous video uh we have seen that we have to write code in kotlin and we have installed intellij idea but as i said we require just as just like we require uh sdk for android studio we require jdk for um intellij idea so what is jdk jdk or the java development kit is a cross platform software development environment does that offers a collection of tools and library is necessary for developing java based software application and applets so i'll explain in it basic words uh so i have given you an analogy for sdk if you remember like just like we need groceries so you can think of jdk or sdk as grocery store and you can think of the intellij idea or the ide as kitchen so we need groceries from the grocery store to prepare food in the kitchen similarly we need some libraries or some tools from the jdk or the sdk to prepare code in here to develop here to run a code in the ide okay so the jdk is one of the three core technology package used in java programming along with jvm and jre jvm is the java virtual machine jre is the java and time environment okay so the jvm is the java platform component that executes program okay so jvm is is the uh rupees player plays role in the execution of program the jre is the on disk part of java that creates the jvm okay so basically the jvm jre jvm is a part of jre and the jdk allows developer to create java programs that can be executive and run by the jvm and jre so he will be it will be more clear by this the jdk contains the gre and some development tools the gre contains the jvm and some library classes and the jvm uh executes the code the distinction between jdk and jre is that jdk is a package of tool for developing java based software whereas jre is a package of tool for running java code so the jdk is a tools for developing the java based software and jre is for running okay the jdk requires gre because running java program is a part of developing them so now we will be proceeding to install the jdk before installing the jdk go to this pc or my computer click on properties and we are just seeing if your operating system is a 64 bit or a 32bit so my operating system is a 64bit operating system if you are is yours is a 34 32bit please note that now we will go to google and we'll type java sorry jdk for windows okay so we will click the link of java downloads by oracle and if you are using linux or mac os please download from here for windows user please go to windows tab and for 64 installer download the 64 installer and here it is downloading so while that downloads for mac os user please download from here and for linux users install the jdk from here so as it is installed open the jdk click on yes wait for the installer to open click on next click on next and the java is installing on your device so now as java is installed successfully we have to close this close the uh close this also so now we what we have to do is we have to check where java is and on is in our system or not so what we'll do is we will go to the run and type cmd here okay and we will type the command java c so it is directly installed in my computer but if you are not seeing this if you are saying that it is not a recognizable command then what you what you do is you will go to this pc or my computer okay you will go to windows c you will go to the program files and find java in it click on the jdk click on the bin folder copy the path from here ctrl c click on the above part and ctrl c okay go to this pc again go to the properties and here go to advanced system settings in advanced system settings go to environment variables so if you are not seeing it it must be not in your environment variable so what you want to do is in the user variables click new and here create java and give the variable value this okay then click ok and then click ok and ok and now we will when will you when you will type in the cmd command java c then it will be showing this okay
