00:02 - give you an brief overview of obuntu
00:06 - operating system so this video is
00:08 - targeted to the audience which has uh
00:12 - recently installed Ubuntu and want to
00:16 - know how uh things Works in OBU so let's
00:21 - get started so this is uh the uh window
00:27 - you see when you log in
00:31 - totu and first thing you will see here
00:35 - this is called the bar and here you can
00:39 - find some of the pre-installed software
00:42 - like micros uh this Firefox web browser
00:46 - or this lib office and open to op
00:51 - software Center and this open 2 software
00:54 - Center will be your one destination to
00:59 - install all softwares in Ubuntu so let's
01:03 - start with this soft Ubuntu
01:07 - software Center just click this open to
01:09 - software Center here and it will open
01:13 - this window and it will give you the
01:17 - list of software you can download from
01:21 - obuntu because when you install obuntu
01:23 - it doesn't come with uh all the software
01:27 - uh installed you need to install
01:30 - all each and every new software which is
01:34 - third party software by
01:37 - yourself so for example um when you want
01:40 - to play some video you need to install
01:43 - VLC player so just go to this search
01:46 - here and just write
01:48 - VLC and you will see here you can see
01:52 - here a VLC player right now I have
01:55 - installed this VLC player that's why I
01:59 - don't see any install button but if you
02:02 - are new and you you have freshly
02:04 - installed Ubuntu you will be able to see
02:07 - here uh install button so you just uh
02:11 - type in your the software you need and
02:15 - then you just need to install it for
02:18 - example I want to install this Genie IDE
02:22 - I just select this and you can see here
02:26 - there is a install button here and when
02:28 - you press this install
02:30 - it will be installed in your system so
02:32 - for example I install this genie in my
02:35 - system it will ask for my
02:38 - password and now it will start
02:42 - installing right so once it's
02:48 - installed it will go or you will be able
02:51 - to find this software in your dash home
02:55 - here so let uh it install and we will
02:59 - see see how we can find this Genie IDE

03:17 - click this and you can see here whatever
03:21 - software you already have installed and

03:58 - good softwares
04:00 - and they are most of them are free of
04:04 - course because obuntu is Al also free so
04:07 - most of the software on obuntu you can
04:10 - install it for free but some of them are
04:13 - cost a little so just see whether they
04:18 - have any cost like these or they are
04:20 - free like these you can see here free
04:23 - all the softwares are free which are
04:25 - here okay now when you start using
04:31 - Ubuntu you need to deal with
04:35 - the terminal so this is the terminal so
