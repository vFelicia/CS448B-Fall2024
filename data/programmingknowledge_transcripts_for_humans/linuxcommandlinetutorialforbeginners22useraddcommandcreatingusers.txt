00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners and in this video we will
00:05 - learn how to use user add command create
00:09 - users in Linux so to create a user we
00:13 - can use a command called user add and
00:17 - with this command we use some flags and
00:21 - the user name to create a user so let's
00:25 - see how we can create a user using this
00:28 - command so you just need to type this
00:30 - command which is user add and then the
00:33 - name of the user the name of the user
00:36 - can be anything for example mark or user
00:40 - one or anything which you want so this
00:44 - is the user name which you want to give
00:46 - so I want to give the user name for
00:49 - example mark ok
00:50 - and then the second flag which you can
00:54 - use is - M flag right and what this flag
00:59 - is going to do is it's going to create a
01:03 - default home directory for this user
01:07 - right so we are going to see once this
01:09 - command is executed that's that the home
01:13 - directory with this name will be created
01:15 - whenever we will see the home
01:18 - directories right now the next command
01:21 - is - s command and this is the command
01:26 - for the default shell okay so this - s
01:31 - command is used for allowing the user to
01:36 - use the shell whatever we provide after
01:39 - this flag so generally we give the bash
01:43 - sub in forward slash bash here so
01:49 - something like this okay so this is most
01:52 - commonly used you know shell so I'm
01:55 - going to use this now the next command
01:58 - is - G this is next flag I beg your
02:03 - pardon and this is the default user flag
02:07 - and after this after space after this
02:10 - flag whatever user
02:12 - you type the user will be assigned that
02:15 - group so the default group is users and
02:20 - I would recommend that you always use
02:24 - the minus G flag this users group which
02:29 - is correct to use there is also some
02:33 - more flags for example minus C for
02:36 - providing the comments you can provide
02:39 - any comments here for this user for
02:43 - example I want to give some comment my
02:47 - comment for example right so any comment
02:51 - can be given to the user using this flag
02:54 - - see ok now there are much more flags
02:59 - you can use for example - G for giving
03:04 - the user defined group or assigning the
03:06 - user defined group which we are not
03:08 - going to use but just use man command on
03:12 - with this user add command and you will
03:15 - be able to see what are the you know
03:17 - flags which you can use with this user
03:20 - and come on and because we are creating
03:24 - the user we need to create user with our
03:27 - root you know access so you just need to
03:30 - write sudo in front of this command in
03:33 - order to create this user because you
03:37 - don't want to you know allow anybody to
03:40 - create the user the root user can you
03:43 - know create the user right so this is
03:47 - the command sudo and then the user add
03:51 - command then the name of the user then
03:53 - the flag M is used for creating the
03:57 - default home directory as is for default
04:00 - shell - G is for the default group - C
04:04 - is for the comment and then you can
04:06 - press the Enter key which is going to
04:08 - ask for your password and then press
04:11 - enter once again this is going to create
04:14 - this user
04:16 - now just do LS and then forward slash
04:20 - home and you can see my new user here is
04:25 - created with
04:26 - the name mark which is this name so this
04:30 - directory is created in our home folder
04:32 - for the new user right but you may ask
04:36 - that we haven't provided any password to
04:40 - this user so whenever this user wants to
04:43 - login
04:43 - he will log in with the username and the
04:46 - password but we haven't provided any
04:48 - password here so this password can be
04:51 - you know given to the user with the
04:54 - command called the pass WD okay not W
05:00 - key but WT okay so when you give this
05:03 - command as it is then it it will allow
05:07 - you to change the you know password for
05:11 - the you root user but when you use this
05:14 - command with the argument for example I
05:17 - will use this command pass WT with the
05:22 - user name mark then this will allow me
05:25 - to change the password of the mark right
05:29 - and then you also need to use sudo
05:32 - command because you may have to give the
05:35 - root X's in order to change the password
05:38 - of the user right so whenever you use
05:42 - this like this then it will allow you to
05:45 - change your password and whenever you
05:47 - give the name of the user then it will
05:49 - allow you to change the password of the
05:52 - user
05:52 - ok so press enter and now it says enter
05:56 - the new password so give any password
05:59 - whichever you want to give to the user
06:01 - for example I will give a simple
06:03 - password here and I will press ENTER and
06:06 - then I need to retype this password so I
06:09 - will retype this password and press
06:11 - enter and you can see it says password
06:14 - updated successfully so now for the new
06:18 - user you can give this name and whatever
06:21 - password you have assigned to this user
06:23 - to the new user and he will be able to
06:26 - login with this username and password
06:29 - okay so this is how you can create a
06:32 - user in Linux in the next video we will
06:35 - see how we can remove a user in Linux
06:39 - and I will recommend that you can create
06:42 - you know four or five users so we can
06:45 - play with these users okay so with the
06:48 - same command you can create multiple
06:50 - users and these users we can use in the
06:54 - next video to remove them okay so I hope
06:58 - you enjoyed this video please rate

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners and in this video we will learn how to use user add command create users in Linux so to create a user we can use a command called user add and with this command we use some flags and the user name to create a user so let's see how we can create a user using this command so you just need to type this command which is user add and then the name of the user the name of the user can be anything for example mark or user one or anything which you want so this is the user name which you want to give so I want to give the user name for example mark ok and then the second flag which you can use is M flag right and what this flag is going to do is it's going to create a default home directory for this user right so we are going to see once this command is executed that's that the home directory with this name will be created whenever we will see the home directories right now the next command is s command and this is the command for the default shell okay so this s command is used for allowing the user to use the shell whatever we provide after this flag so generally we give the bash sub in forward slash bash here so something like this okay so this is most commonly used you know shell so I'm going to use this now the next command is G this is next flag I beg your pardon and this is the default user flag and after this after space after this flag whatever user you type the user will be assigned that group so the default group is users and I would recommend that you always use the minus G flag this users group which is correct to use there is also some more flags for example minus C for providing the comments you can provide any comments here for this user for example I want to give some comment my comment for example right so any comment can be given to the user using this flag see ok now there are much more flags you can use for example G for giving the user defined group or assigning the user defined group which we are not going to use but just use man command on with this user add command and you will be able to see what are the you know flags which you can use with this user and come on and because we are creating the user we need to create user with our root you know access so you just need to write sudo in front of this command in order to create this user because you don't want to you know allow anybody to create the user the root user can you know create the user right so this is the command sudo and then the user add command then the name of the user then the flag M is used for creating the default home directory as is for default shell G is for the default group C is for the comment and then you can press the Enter key which is going to ask for your password and then press enter once again this is going to create this user now just do LS and then forward slash home and you can see my new user here is created with the name mark which is this name so this directory is created in our home folder for the new user right but you may ask that we haven't provided any password to this user so whenever this user wants to login he will log in with the username and the password but we haven't provided any password here so this password can be you know given to the user with the command called the pass WD okay not W key but WT okay so when you give this command as it is then it it will allow you to change the you know password for the you root user but when you use this command with the argument for example I will use this command pass WT with the user name mark then this will allow me to change the password of the mark right and then you also need to use sudo command because you may have to give the root X's in order to change the password of the user right so whenever you use this like this then it will allow you to change your password and whenever you give the name of the user then it will allow you to change the password of the user ok so press enter and now it says enter the new password so give any password whichever you want to give to the user for example I will give a simple password here and I will press ENTER and then I need to retype this password so I will retype this password and press enter and you can see it says password updated successfully so now for the new user you can give this name and whatever password you have assigned to this user to the new user and he will be able to login with this username and password okay so this is how you can create a user in Linux in the next video we will see how we can remove a user in Linux and I will recommend that you can create you know four or five users so we can play with these users okay so with the same command you can create multiple users and these users we can use in the next video to remove them okay so I hope you enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
