00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - to use up button with your android
00:09 - action bar now in which situation you
00:13 - may want to use up button with your
00:16 - android action bar so for example you
00:20 - have an app which have multiple intents
00:24 - and you want to navigate through these
00:27 - intense easily then you may use a button
00:32 - with your android action bar so let's
00:35 - see first of all how we can use this UP
00:40 - button so for example I want to have
00:43 - multiple intense first to show this UP
00:48 - button functionality so let's create
00:50 - some activities okay so I'm going to
00:55 - create a new activity and this is going
01:00 - to be a blank activity and I named this
01:04 - as activity a for example okay so this
01:09 - is activity a and in the same way I'm
01:14 - going to create one more activity so go
01:17 - to app right-click go to activity blank
01:20 - activity and this time this will be
01:23 - activity B okay so now I have two
01:27 - activities and one main activity okay
01:31 - now I will go to my main activity and to
01:35 - recognize that this is my main activity
01:37 - I can give some message to it by using
01:42 - this large text and I'm going to add
01:44 - this button here and I'm going to change
01:47 - the text of this button and this large
01:51 - text by going to this text of this
01:54 - activity and instead of larger text I am
01:57 - going to write main activity okay and
02:02 - this button I am going to name it as I
02:05 - want to open our activity a from this
02:09 - button click so I will say
02:13 - open a in a same way I will go to
02:16 - activity a which I have created and I
02:21 - will go to the design right now it has
02:23 - hello world text I will delete it and
02:27 - I'm going to take a large text and a
02:30 - button here and I will go to the text
02:33 - here and I will change the text of this
02:37 - large text as activity a okay so we know
02:41 - that this is our activity a and the
02:44 - button I will name it as open B because
02:48 - I want to open activity B using this
02:52 - button so open B now I will go to
02:55 - activity B design and in here to
03:00 - recognize it I will add a large text
03:03 - here also so I will just delete this
03:05 - hello world message and I will add a
03:08 - large text and in the text I will change
03:13 - the text of this large text to activity
03:17 - B okay so now I can recognize by going
03:22 - to the design that this is my activity
03:24 - mean and I want to open activity a from
03:29 - it and then from activity a I want to
03:32 - open activity B okay
03:34 - and from activity B for example I want
03:38 - to navigate directly to my home activity
03:42 - on main activity right so first of all
03:46 - let's create some code so that I can
03:49 - open my activity a from main and
03:53 - activity B from activity a okay I will
03:56 - go to my main activity and in here in
04:00 - the text area of this button I will
04:04 - create one more attribute which is
04:07 - Android on click okay and this will
04:12 - listen for one click event of the button
04:16 - okay
04:17 - and what I will listen for I will listen
04:19 - for a method called for example open a
04:23 - and in a same way I will go to my
04:27 - activity a and I will go to the text
04:31 - area of this activity a and in the
04:34 - button I want to add one more attribute
04:36 - to open activity B so I will create a
04:42 - new attribute called
04:43 - on click and I will listen for the
04:47 - method called open B now let's go to our
04:51 - main activity dot Java file and in here
04:55 - we are going to create a method which
04:58 - will be a public method and we are going
05:02 - to return nothing from it and we will
05:06 - name it as open a as we have done in XML
05:13 - file ok the same name as this one and as
05:17 - an argument we are going to pass this
05:19 - view class and inside this we just want
05:24 - to create an intent which can open
05:27 - activity a so I will just call start
05:31 - activity and I'm going to open this
05:34 - activity using new intent so I will just
05:37 - create new intent and this will take the
05:41 - context first and then the activity name
05:44 - okay so activity a I want to open so
05:49 - activity dot class ok and this is going
05:55 - to open the activity a from activity
06:00 - mean right same thing I want to do in my
06:03 - activity a class ok so I'm going to just
06:07 - copy this and I will paste this but this
06:11 - time this will be open B right because
06:16 - in our activity a we have created this
06:21 - on click listener for open B method ok
06:25 - so it will be open B and instead of
06:29 - opening activity a we are going to open
06:32 - activity B and instead of this we are
06:36 - going to just use activity a
06:40 - next dot this okay
06:43 - now let's run this program and let's see
06:46 - if it opens our activities or not
06:50 - so my app is running now and when I
06:53 - click this open a right now we are in
06:55 - main activity right and when we click
06:58 - open a it's going to open activity a and
07:02 - when we click open B it's going to open
07:04 - activity B right now if you want to go
07:09 - to the main activity from here you have
07:13 - no button or nothing to you know go back
07:17 - you need to click this back button in
07:20 - your mobile to go to the main activity
07:24 - and this is not convenient right so what
07:28 - we can do is we can add a UP button to
07:33 - our action bar so that we can directly
07:36 - go to the home activity or home page
07:41 - okay so let's do this so what we are
07:45 - going to do here is we are going to go
07:48 - to our main manifest dot XML file so go
07:52 - to Android manifest dot XML file and in
07:56 - here you will be able to see your
07:58 - activities are added in here okay so
08:01 - this is the activity a and this is the
08:05 - activity B so in here we want to add the
08:08 - parent to these activities right so how
08:12 - we will do this we will go to this
08:14 - activity tag of this activity a and we
08:17 - will add a new attribute called Android
08:20 - parent activity name and we are going to
08:25 - provide the parent name which is our
08:27 - main activity ok in a similar way for
08:31 - activity B we will add this tag which is
08:35 - Android parent activity name and for
08:39 - this also we will provide main activity
08:41 - as the parent
08:43 - okay now this UP button is available I
08:47 - think from version 4.0 or above I think
08:53 - so below 4.0 you may want to add or you
08:58 - may have to add a extra tag called meta
09:03 - data so go here and add a tag called
09:07 - meta data and in here as the Android
09:11 - name we are going to call Android dot
09:16 - support dot parent activity okay so and
09:21 - let's close this tag here and one more
09:25 - attribute we want to add here is Android
09:29 - value and this value will be our main
09:32 - activity okay and let's copy this meta
09:36 - data tag from here and paste it inside
09:40 - our activity B also okay now we will go
09:44 - to our main activity dot Java file and
09:46 - in the oncreate method inside our main
09:50 - activity dot Java file we will just
09:52 - write get supported action bar dot set
10:00 - default display home as update enabled
10:03 - and we are just going to set it as true
10:07 - and now we are going to run our app so
10:11 - our app is running now and we can see
10:13 - this main activity and when I'm going to
10:16 - click this open a I'm going to go to my
10:20 - activity a and in the activity a you
10:24 - will be able to see this button which is
10:27 - our up button right and when I click
10:30 - open B it's going to open activity B and
10:35 - in here also I can see this UP button
10:37 - and when I click this UP button I can
10:40 - directly reach to my main activity so
10:44 - from my activity a also I can go here
10:47 - and if I'm on activity B I can directly
10:51 - go to my activity mean so in this way
10:55 - you can use UP button in your action bar
