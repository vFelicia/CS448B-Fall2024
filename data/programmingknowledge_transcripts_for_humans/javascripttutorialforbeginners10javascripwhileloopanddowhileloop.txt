00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how to use Loops
00:08 - in JavaScript and in this particular
00:10 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:12 - while loop and do while loop in
00:16 - JavaScript so first of all what is a
00:19 - loop a loop is a piece of statement
00:23 - which will allow you to perform some
00:25 - piece of code again and again until and
00:29 - unless some condition is fulfilled right
00:33 - so let's say I have a variable called a
00:37 - and I will initialize it with zero okay
00:40 - and I will initialize one more variable
00:43 - called uh result and this I will use it
00:47 - to display some value now let's see how
00:51 - uh the while loop looks like so you use
00:56 - while keyword and then Here Comes Your
01:00 - condition right and then in the curly
01:03 - braces comes your code if your condition
01:06 - in this bracket is met okay so this is
01:11 - for the condition this round bracket is
01:13 - for the condition and if your condition
01:17 - is met then the code inside these curly
01:21 - braces will be
01:23 - executed okay and if the condition is
01:26 - not met then it'll once again perform
01:30 - the same code until and unless this
01:32 - condition is met so let's say we want to
01:36 - uh you know have the condition a is less
01:40 - than 10 okay so right now obviously a is
01:45 - equal to 0 Which is less than 10 so it
01:48 - will go inside the Y Loop and it will
01:52 - perform the code right so for example I
01:55 - will just say result is equal to a okay
02:00 - and for uh the Simplicity I will just
02:03 - add a break uh tag here so just add this
02:07 - uh break tags so that uh it will be
02:10 - printed on the different line every time
02:13 - this code is executed right and this
02:16 - result I'm just passing here which will
02:18 - print this using this demo ID and I have
02:22 - this uh paragraph with ID demo here so
02:26 - in this paragraph This will be executed
02:29 - right
02:31 - now here if you notice that this
02:34 - condition will never be fulfilled if we
02:38 - uh write this kind of code right this
02:41 - condition is infinite condition because
02:44 - we are not increasing the value of a so
02:48 - the value of a is constant so our while
02:51 - loop will go on performing the code
02:55 - again and again infinitely right and
02:59 - this kind of infinite Loop are also
03:01 - useful in some conditions but right now
03:04 - in our condition what we want to do here
03:07 - is let's say we want to increase the
03:09 - value of a by one every time it goes
03:13 - inside the loop okay now what I'm going
03:16 - to do here is I'm going to add this plus
03:20 - uh symbol or concatenation symbol here
03:23 - and what it's going to do is it's going
03:25 - to add the value of this string to this
03:29 - result
03:30 - every time it executes this code and one
03:33 - more thing what I'm going to do here is
03:35 - I'm going to initialize this result with
03:38 - empty string something like this okay so
03:42 - the value of result will not be
03:44 - ambiguous when it's initialized right so
03:47 - save your code and run it here and now
03:50 - you can see this is printing from 0 to 9
03:55 - okay so what happens here so in your y
03:58 - Loop we know that that this condition is
04:01 - obviously true 0 is less than 10 so it
04:04 - will go inside the Y Loop and perform
04:08 - this code and what this code is doing
04:10 - it's just assigning the value of a in
04:13 - the result right and then it goes here
04:17 - in the next line and it increases the
04:20 - value of a by one so the value of a
04:22 - becomes one here because it was
04:25 - initially zero and uh then we add one
04:28 - here using this code and the value of a
04:32 - is 1 so it goes once again in the loop
04:35 - and it check 1 is less than 10 yes so it
04:39 - performed this code once again and add
04:41 - this string to the result once again and
04:45 - then the value of a becomes two here
04:48 - right so in the in this way it will keep
04:50 - on looping 2 3 4 until 9 reaches and in
04:55 - this case also this condition is true
04:58 - and it will uh increase the value of a
05:00 - by 1 and then value of a becomes 10
05:05 - which in here is false so 10 is not less
05:08 - than 10 so this condition is not true so
05:12 - this code will not be executed right so
05:15 - that's why it's printing the value from
05:19 - 0 to 9 okay now you can have something
05:24 - like this a is less than or equal to 10
05:29 - okay okay so in this case it will print
05:32 - from 0 to 10 because we are also
05:34 - evaluating equal to now okay or you can
05:39 - have different conditions here for
05:41 - example a is greater than or a is not
05:45 - equal to 10 so you can evaluate
05:48 - different kind of conditions in this
05:51 - while loop here okay so this is how your
05:56 - while loop works now there is one more
05:59 - kind of loop which is called do while
06:02 - loop okay and the syntax of this do
06:06 - while loop is something like this so you
06:09 - use the keyword do first and then after
06:12 - the curly braces you say while okay and
06:17 - then the semicolon okay so in here it's
06:21 - the same you evaluate some condition
06:25 - inside these brackets right so what I'm
06:28 - going to do here is I'm going to declare
06:29 - one more variable and I'm going to name
06:32 - it as B and I'm going to initialize it
06:35 - with zero and this B I'm going to
06:39 - evaluate in this while loop condition so
06:43 - B is uh for example less than or equal
06:46 - to 10 the same situation which we have
06:50 - evaluated in here okay and we will just
06:54 - uh copy the same code from here and
06:57 - paste it in do y Loop and let's define
07:01 - one more valuable for example result one
07:05 - which is for do while loop Result One
07:08 - okay and let's define one more paragraph
07:11 - tag and this is demo one and here also I
07:15 - will Define one more document. get
07:18 - element by ID for demo one and here I
07:22 - will print Result One okay and this will
07:26 - be B and this will be B okay so let's
07:31 - see what happens this is our while loop
07:34 - and this is our do while loop okay so
07:37 - let's save the code and refresh the web
07:40 - page and you can see here it prints the
07:43 - value from 0 to 10 using the Y Loop and
07:47 - once again when I go down it prints the
07:50 - value of 0 to 10 using the do while loop
07:55 - so they are working in the same manner
07:59 - right so you will say What's the
08:00 - difference between them if they are
08:02 - working in the same manner so the basic
08:05 - difference between while loop and do
08:08 - while loop is that while loop evaluates
08:13 - the condition first and then executes
08:16 - your code while the do while
08:20 - loop performs your code for the first
08:23 - time and then evaluates your condition
08:27 - right so doy Loop no matter what at
08:31 - least one will execute the code inside
08:33 - these curly braces even if this
08:36 - condition is false so it's logical right
08:40 - it says do first and then evaluate the
08:43 - condition and in here we are first
08:46 - evaluating a condition and then
08:48 - executing the code so let's say we are
08:51 - uh evaluating that A is for example
08:55 - minus1 right and In Here Also as B we
09:00 - are evaluating the condition minus1
09:03 - which is false because B is equal to 0
09:07 - right and in the while loop also a is
09:09 - equal to zero right so save your code
09:12 - and refresh the web page and it prints
09:15 - zero which is due to this do Loop so
09:21 - let's say uh we say do and here we
09:25 - say while so we can recognize from which
09:29 - Line This zero is printed so just save
09:32 - your code and refresh it once again and
09:35 - you see once after do is printed then
09:39 - zero is printed right so it's coming
09:41 - from this line okay so what's happening
09:46 - here so here this condition is false so
09:50 - this code will not be executed but in
09:54 - here in the do while loop first the code
09:58 - is executed Ed and then the condition is
10:02 - uh evaluated so this code is executed
10:05 - once and then it goes to while loop and
10:08 - it checks whether this condition is uh
10:10 - true or false and it's false so it's not
10:13 - going to Loop it once again so this is
10:16 - the basic difference between while loop
10:18 - and do while loop so I hope you've

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use Loops in JavaScript and in this particular video I'm going to show you how to use while loop and do while loop in JavaScript so first of all what is a loop a loop is a piece of statement which will allow you to perform some piece of code again and again until and unless some condition is fulfilled right so let's say I have a variable called a and I will initialize it with zero okay and I will initialize one more variable called uh result and this I will use it to display some value now let's see how uh the while loop looks like so you use while keyword and then Here Comes Your condition right and then in the curly braces comes your code if your condition in this bracket is met okay so this is for the condition this round bracket is for the condition and if your condition is met then the code inside these curly braces will be executed okay and if the condition is not met then it'll once again perform the same code until and unless this condition is met so let's say we want to uh you know have the condition a is less than 10 okay so right now obviously a is equal to 0 Which is less than 10 so it will go inside the Y Loop and it will perform the code right so for example I will just say result is equal to a okay and for uh the Simplicity I will just add a break uh tag here so just add this uh break tags so that uh it will be printed on the different line every time this code is executed right and this result I'm just passing here which will print this using this demo ID and I have this uh paragraph with ID demo here so in this paragraph This will be executed right now here if you notice that this condition will never be fulfilled if we uh write this kind of code right this condition is infinite condition because we are not increasing the value of a so the value of a is constant so our while loop will go on performing the code again and again infinitely right and this kind of infinite Loop are also useful in some conditions but right now in our condition what we want to do here is let's say we want to increase the value of a by one every time it goes inside the loop okay now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add this plus uh symbol or concatenation symbol here and what it's going to do is it's going to add the value of this string to this result every time it executes this code and one more thing what I'm going to do here is I'm going to initialize this result with empty string something like this okay so the value of result will not be ambiguous when it's initialized right so save your code and run it here and now you can see this is printing from 0 to 9 okay so what happens here so in your y Loop we know that that this condition is obviously true 0 is less than 10 so it will go inside the Y Loop and perform this code and what this code is doing it's just assigning the value of a in the result right and then it goes here in the next line and it increases the value of a by one so the value of a becomes one here because it was initially zero and uh then we add one here using this code and the value of a is 1 so it goes once again in the loop and it check 1 is less than 10 yes so it performed this code once again and add this string to the result once again and then the value of a becomes two here right so in the in this way it will keep on looping 2 3 4 until 9 reaches and in this case also this condition is true and it will uh increase the value of a by 1 and then value of a becomes 10 which in here is false so 10 is not less than 10 so this condition is not true so this code will not be executed right so that's why it's printing the value from 0 to 9 okay now you can have something like this a is less than or equal to 10 okay okay so in this case it will print from 0 to 10 because we are also evaluating equal to now okay or you can have different conditions here for example a is greater than or a is not equal to 10 so you can evaluate different kind of conditions in this while loop here okay so this is how your while loop works now there is one more kind of loop which is called do while loop okay and the syntax of this do while loop is something like this so you use the keyword do first and then after the curly braces you say while okay and then the semicolon okay so in here it's the same you evaluate some condition inside these brackets right so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to declare one more variable and I'm going to name it as B and I'm going to initialize it with zero and this B I'm going to evaluate in this while loop condition so B is uh for example less than or equal to 10 the same situation which we have evaluated in here okay and we will just uh copy the same code from here and paste it in do y Loop and let's define one more valuable for example result one which is for do while loop Result One okay and let's define one more paragraph tag and this is demo one and here also I will Define one more document. get element by ID for demo one and here I will print Result One okay and this will be B and this will be B okay so let's see what happens this is our while loop and this is our do while loop okay so let's save the code and refresh the web page and you can see here it prints the value from 0 to 10 using the Y Loop and once again when I go down it prints the value of 0 to 10 using the do while loop so they are working in the same manner right so you will say What's the difference between them if they are working in the same manner so the basic difference between while loop and do while loop is that while loop evaluates the condition first and then executes your code while the do while loop performs your code for the first time and then evaluates your condition right so doy Loop no matter what at least one will execute the code inside these curly braces even if this condition is false so it's logical right it says do first and then evaluate the condition and in here we are first evaluating a condition and then executing the code so let's say we are uh evaluating that A is for example minus1 right and In Here Also as B we are evaluating the condition minus1 which is false because B is equal to 0 right and in the while loop also a is equal to zero right so save your code and refresh the web page and it prints zero which is due to this do Loop so let's say uh we say do and here we say while so we can recognize from which Line This zero is printed so just save your code and refresh it once again and you see once after do is printed then zero is printed right so it's coming from this line okay so what's happening here so here this condition is false so this code will not be executed but in here in the do while loop first the code is executed Ed and then the condition is uh evaluated so this code is executed once and then it goes to while loop and it checks whether this condition is uh true or false and it's false so it's not going to Loop it once again so this is the basic difference between while loop and do while loop so I hope you've enjoyed this video please write comment subscribe and
