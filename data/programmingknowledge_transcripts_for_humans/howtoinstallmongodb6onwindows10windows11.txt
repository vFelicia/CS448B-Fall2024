00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install and
00:05 - use mongodb on your windows 11 operating
00:09 - system
00:10 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:12 - we can do it
00:13 - so first of all open your favorite
00:15 - browser and search for mongodb download
00:18 - and the first link which will appear
00:20 - here will be from mongodb.com forward
00:24 - slash try forward slash community so
00:26 - essentially we want to download the
00:29 - community server of mongodb which is
00:32 - free to use so just click on this link
00:35 - which is going to open this mongodb
00:38 - community server download section here
00:42 - when you scroll down you will be able to
00:44 - see the windows section so just select
00:48 - the latest version of
00:51 - mongodb at the time of making this video
00:54 - 6.0.5 is the latest version if you want
00:57 - to install the previous versions you can
01:00 - select those versions from here also
01:02 - right
01:03 - then you can select the platform which
01:06 - is Windows for us and the package which
01:08 - is MSI uh for us you can also download
01:12 - the zip file but I'm going to download
01:13 - the MSI file which is easier to install
01:16 - and then click on download button which
01:19 - is going to start the download of this
01:22 - mongodb Windows dot MSI file so once
01:26 - this MSI file is downloaded I'm going to
01:28 - click on this MSI file
01:30 - and let me minimize my browser and you
01:33 - can see the installer is starting so now
01:36 - I can see this mongodb setup wizard has
01:40 - been started so just click on next here
01:43 - and then accept license terms and
01:45 - conditions and click on next so here you
01:47 - can see the setup type
01:49 - so I will recommend you to select the
01:53 - complete button here and it says all
01:57 - program features will be installed
01:58 - requires the most disk space and
02:01 - recommended for most users
02:04 - now it also says the shell must be
02:08 - installed separately for Windows
02:10 - installations
02:12 - and there is this link given here so I
02:15 - can click on this download now button
02:17 - for shell shell is
02:20 - essentially a client which will
02:23 - allow you to interact with your mongodb
02:27 - server right so right now we are
02:30 - installing the mongodb server but if you
02:34 - want to install the mongodb shell then
02:36 - you need to click on this download
02:38 - button and once you click on the
02:41 - download shell or link you will be
02:44 - able to see in your browser this link
02:46 - will open
02:48 - we can download this shell later
02:51 - but first let's complete the
02:53 - installation of Community server
02:55 - and then we can also install shell
03:00 - later right here I'm going to click on
03:03 - complete button and then I can see the
03:07 - server configuration
03:09 - you can see install mongodb as a service
03:11 - which is checked which is ok which means
03:14 - that as soon as your Windows operating
03:17 - system starts mongodb is going to run as
03:21 - a service on your Windows operating
03:23 - system
03:24 - so you don't need to worry about
03:26 - anything
03:27 - just leave everything as default which
03:30 - is run Service as network service user
03:33 - these are the location of your data and
03:36 - the log folder in the data folder all
03:39 - your data in your mongodb will be saved
03:42 - and in the logs folder all the logs
03:45 - related to your mongodb servers will be
03:47 - saved just click on next here
03:50 - and then you can see install mongodb
03:53 - compass
03:54 - mongodb Compass is an official graphical
03:57 - user interface for mongodb which will
04:00 - allow you to fetch your data from your
04:03 - mongodb server so it's essentially a
04:05 - graphical user interface for interacting
04:09 - with your mongodb data so I will
04:12 - recommend this to download so just click
04:16 - on this checkbox if it's not already
04:19 - selected and then click on next and then
04:22 - click on install and you will be able to
04:25 - see this kind of option which says do
04:26 - you want to allow this app to make
04:28 - changes on your device I will click on
04:29 - yes here which is going to start the
04:32 - installation process of mongodb so just
04:34 - wait for few seconds until you see this
04:37 - progress bar reaching to the hundred
04:40 - percent Mark so I can see that mongodb
04:43 - Compass is already installed and it has
04:47 - already opened the mongodb compass on my
04:50 - Windows operating system
04:52 - and now I can also see that the mongodb
04:55 - community server installation has been
04:58 - finished also so I can click on this
05:01 - finish button and as you can see mongodb
05:05 - Compass has already been started as the
05:07 - part of installation I can click on
05:10 - start here and now I can see that the
05:14 - mongodb compass has been started
05:17 - now if it doesn't open you can see the
05:21 - desktop icon for mongodb Compass has
05:24 - been created so I can click on this
05:26 - mongodb Compass icon and this will open
05:30 - this mongodb compass on my Windows
05:33 - operating system right
05:35 - so as I already mentioned mongodb
05:38 - Compass is a graphical user interface
05:42 - which acts like a client for your
05:45 - mongodb server so for connecting to your
05:48 - default mongodb server database you can
05:52 - use this default URL which is mongodb
05:56 - colon forward slash forward slash
05:59 - localhost colon
06:02 - 27017 this is the default Port okay so
06:06 - you don't need to change anything just
06:08 - click on connect and it's going to
06:10 - connect to your default mongodb server
06:13 - here you already have few databases
06:16 - these are some of the default databases
06:19 - which are already present in your
06:22 - mongodb you can also see this my query
06:25 - section right now there is no query
06:28 - you can create a new database by
06:30 - clicking on this create database button
06:33 - and then you can just create a new
06:37 - database for example I want to create a
06:40 - database called mydb
06:42 - I can do that also I can create a
06:45 - collection inside my DB
06:47 - so I can
06:49 - name my connect collection anything I am
06:52 - going to name my collection as for
06:54 - example
06:56 - orders right and then I can click on
07:01 - create database
07:03 - since mongodb 5 there is an option to
07:07 - create the time series database also but
07:10 - for now I just want to create a normal
07:12 - collection so I'm going to click on
07:14 - create database and it's going to create
07:17 - this database with this collection in my
07:22 - database right you can add the data from
07:25 - here you can either import the Json file
07:30 - with Conte which contains data or you
07:33 - can directly insert the data in your
07:35 - mongodb right so this is the ID
07:39 - I can just
07:42 - add few more options here I can add the
07:46 - cost for example 12 right and then click
07:50 - on insert and the data is going to be
07:53 - inserted in your collection right so
07:57 - this is how you can create a database
07:59 - collection and insert data into the
08:02 - collection you can also click on find
08:04 - here which is going to show you all the
08:07 - data in your database you can also
08:10 - create aggregations you can view the
08:12 - schemas and other options here right
08:17 - now as I mentioned if you want to use a
08:20 - command line tool to interact with your
08:24 - mongodb if I open command prompt in
08:28 - Windows operating system by just
08:30 - searching for CMD
08:33 - and when it opens command prompt and
08:36 - when I write here you can see
08:39 -  is not recognized as an internal
08:43 - or external Command right also when I go
08:46 - to
08:47 - my C directory where mongodb is
08:51 - installed and then go to program files
08:54 - here I will be able to see mongodb
08:57 - folder
08:58 - and here only the server is there right
09:01 - so here I can see the
09:06 - mongodb server but I don't see
09:09 - shell so as you might remember
09:12 - uh when we were installing mongodb I
09:15 - have told you that you can install
09:18 - shell separately and this is the link
09:21 - for that so under the mongodb Community
09:25 - you can see tools and there is this
09:28 - mongodb shell option and you can select
09:33 - the version here choose the latest
09:34 - version and then choose the Windows
09:37 - operating system and then you can choose
09:40 - the zip file which is the only option at
09:43 - the time of making this video I am going
09:44 - to click on download which is going to
09:47 - download this ZIP file once this ZIP
09:50 - file is downloaded I'm going to go to
09:52 - the location and then I'm going to
09:54 - extract this ZIP file so I'm going to
09:56 - just right click here and then click on
09:59 - extract all and I'm going to extract
10:02 - this shell zip file in my C
10:06 - directory and then program files and
10:09 - then I'm going to select the mongodb
10:11 - right and inside mongodb I'm going to
10:15 - extract this ZIP file so I'm going to
10:18 - just click on select folder
10:21 - and this is the location where I want to
10:24 - extract this shell and then I'm
10:26 - going to click on continue
10:29 - which is going to extract this file in
10:32 - my
10:33 - DB folder right so let me go to this
10:38 - mongodb folder this shell
10:41 - folder is extracted and there is the
10:45 -  sh dot exe file just copy the path
10:50 - of this bin file and then click on
10:53 - search and then
10:55 - search for edit environment variables
11:00 - right so you will be able to see this
11:02 - option which is called added the system
11:04 - environment variable or you can directly
11:08 - search for this option right edit the
11:11 - system environment variable click on
11:14 - this option
11:15 - and then click on environment variable
11:18 - and then under system variable you will
11:21 - see this path variable click on edit and
11:24 - then click on new and then paste the
11:27 - path of your sh bin directory
11:31 - which we have copied right click on OK
11:35 - and then click on OK and then click on
11:37 - OK and then just restart your command
11:41 - prompt so I'm going to close this
11:42 - command prompt and I'm going to open the
11:45 - command prompt once again and this time
11:48 - I'm going to just write sh and
11:52 - then press enter
11:54 - and it's going to work this time so
11:57 -  shell is going to work this time
11:59 - and you can see we are inside the
12:02 - shell right it has connected to our
12:06 - default mongodb database which is
12:08 - running on localhost
12:10 - and here we can run the command line
12:15 - to fetch the database or create some
12:17 - collection so I can write show DB is
12:21 - here and it's going to show all the DBS
12:24 - I can create a new database by using use
12:27 - and then the name of the database
12:30 - I can name my database as for example
12:36 - code bind for example right and then
12:39 - click on
12:40 - enter and it's going to switch to the
12:45 - codebind database when I once again
12:49 - choose show DBS it's going to show other
12:54 - databases but it's not going to show the
12:57 - code bind database which I have created
13:00 - because in order to view the database
13:03 - which you have created you need to
13:05 - insert some data into a collection right
13:08 - so you need to create a collection and
13:11 - then insert the data into it but Bongo
13:13 - shell is working and then you can write
13:17 - some other commands to
13:19 - interact with your shell so this
13:22 - is how you can install the latest
13:24 - version of mongodb on your Windows
13:27 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
13:28 - this video and I will see you in the
13:30 - next video
