00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to use seek bar with your Android
00:10 - activity so what is a seek bar seek bar
00:14 - is like a progress bar or you can say
00:16 - it's an extension of progress bar with a
00:20 - thumb attached to it okay so let's take
00:24 - an example how to use sear and uh let's
00:28 - uh see how to do it
00:30 - so first of all what I'm going to do is
00:32 - I'm going to go to my pallet and search
00:34 - for a widget called seek bar it's in the
00:38 - widgets and here it is you can just drag
00:42 - and drop into your activity you can also
00:45 - change the property of the seek barar so
00:48 - that it uh its width it's adjusted to
00:51 - the width of your layout so go to the
00:53 - property called layout underscore width
00:57 - or layout colon width and instead of
00:59 - wrap content you can change this width
01:02 - layout width to fill parent and it will
01:05 - fill the parent or the layout okay now
01:09 - the second thing we are going to use
01:12 - here is a text box and we are going to
01:14 - take a large text box and in here we can
01:18 - uh show the progress of the seek bar or
01:21 - what's happening in the seek bar now uh
01:25 - let's go to our main activity. Java and
01:28 - uh let's write some code to to our main
01:31 - activity. Java file so I'm going to go
01:34 - to my main activity. Java so now I'm
01:37 - going to declare two variables one is
01:39 - sear and other is text view
01:50 - okay so now we have declared two
01:53 - variables one is sear and other is text
01:56 - View and let's declare a method which we
01:59 - can call call in our oncreate method so
02:03 - it will
02:05 - be public
02:09 - void
02:11 - seek
02:13 - bar for example and let's uh write some
02:18 - code inside this method and first of all
02:21 - we are going to cast our SE bar and text
02:24 - view variables so let's cast
02:28 - them
02:38 - so now our casting is done and now we
02:41 - will add The Listener to this seek bar
02:45 - but let's uh first set some text on our
02:49 - text view so that uh it can print the
02:52 - progress of uh the seek bar so text view
02:57 - do set text and and inside we can uh
03:01 - just set some text for
03:05 - example covered some amount of seek
03:08 - barar or something like this
03:11 - plus the seek bar variable and we will
03:15 - check the progress so
03:18 - get
03:19 - progress of the seek bar so let's check
03:24 - the progress of the sear and
03:28 - then we will uh show this progress
03:31 - against the maximum uh you know value
03:36 - the sear can show right so let's show it
03:40 - against the maximum value so
03:43 - plus
03:45 - sear dot
03:49 - get
03:50 - Max
03:52 - okay now uh what we are going to do is
03:55 - we are going to take our sear and uh add
03:58 - a listener to this sear so take the sear
04:03 - dot set sear change listener and in here
04:08 - we will add a new uh sear change
04:12 - listener so new on Sear change
04:17 - listener and you will notice that
04:20 - whenever you press enter it adds three
04:23 - method to your on seekbar change
04:25 - listener one is on progress change other
04:30 - is on start tracking touch and third is
04:34 - on stop tracking touch so this one first
04:38 - is for tracking the progress of your
04:40 - sear second is uh tracking the start uh
04:44 - of your SE bar and third one is for
04:47 - tracking the stop of your seek bar okay
04:52 - so now what's uh what we are going to do
04:54 - is uh in this set on click uh change C
04:59 - speak bar listener uh let's create a
05:03 - variable
05:05 - in progress
05:09 - value
05:11 - progress value for example and this we
05:15 - are going to use to uh you know store
05:18 - the progress of this seek bar now we are
05:21 - going to go into this method called on
05:24 - progress change method and in here you
05:27 - can see a variable called progress and
05:30 - this will give you the progress of the
05:33 - seek bar so we will assign this progress
05:36 - to our uh user defined variable which is
05:39 - progress value so progress is equal to
05:43 - progress okay and now uh we will assign
05:48 - this progress to uh the to the text view
05:52 - also okay so what we are going to do
05:58 - here we are we are going to copy uh the
06:02 - same text which we have set on the text
06:05 - view but let's see uh what is this error
06:09 - this error on when we hover over this
06:11 - progress underscore value it says uh the
06:14 - variable progress value is accessed from
06:16 - the inner class that means you should
06:19 - Define this inside your seek Bar Method
06:24 - in here
06:25 - right or better you can do it even
06:29 - inside here okay and then what we are
06:34 - going to do is we will copy this text
06:37 - view. set text and paste it here and
06:40 - instead of this get progress we will
06:43 - just pass this progress variable here
06:47 - okay so this will show us the progress
06:51 - of our sear in the text view okay the
06:55 - same we are going to do in the stop
06:59 - tracking touch because whenever the sear
07:03 - process uh or sear uh drag is stopped we
07:07 - also want to uh you know show this value
07:09 - on the text box but this is store in
07:12 - this uh progress value which is a global
07:15 - variable for these three method so
07:18 - change it to the progress value and then
07:22 - uh we can also uh show some uh text
07:25 - message using toast okay so we will use
07:30 - toast. make text which takes uh three
07:34 - argument first is your class name or
07:38 - your context so main activity
07:41 - dot this second is the message for
07:47 - example seek
07:50 - bar bar
07:54 - in progress okay and let's add the third
07:58 - argument
08:01 - ment
08:02 - toast dot length long and we will show
08:07 - this right the same messages we can add
08:11 - to our other two uh method here one is
08:16 - for start tracking so in here sear we
08:20 - can say start tracking or sear in start
08:26 - tracking and in here we will just
08:30 - add same toast or message and we will
08:34 - say Seek bar in stop
08:37 - tracking
08:39 - okay now uh I think our method is uh
08:43 - done so we just need to call this method
08:45 - inside our oncreate method in
08:48 - here and we just need to run our program
08:52 - so let's run the program so now our
08:55 - program is running and you can see
08:57 - initial status of our
08:59 - seek bar is zero and the maximum value
09:03 - of the seek bar is 100 right so because
09:06 - it's on the left top left end of the you
09:11 - know SE bar that's why our progress is
09:14 - zero right now against 100 now let's uh
09:17 - try to drag this uh thumb towards right
09:21 - and let's see what happens so I drag it
09:25 - and you can see it uh changes uh this um
09:29 - value which is covered and it changes uh
09:33 - the message or toast uh in here right
09:38 - so the process changes and the message
09:41 - here also changes right you can see the
09:45 - process changes and here the message
09:48 - according to the change of the seek bar
09:51 - appears right so in this way you can
09:55 - track the process of seek bar using get
09:59 - process of the get process method of
10:03 - sear and the process method and that's
10:07 - it for this video I hope you have
10:08 - enjoyed this video please rate comment

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use seek bar with your Android activity so what is a seek bar seek bar is like a progress bar or you can say it's an extension of progress bar with a thumb attached to it okay so let's take an example how to use sear and uh let's uh see how to do it so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my pallet and search for a widget called seek bar it's in the widgets and here it is you can just drag and drop into your activity you can also change the property of the seek barar so that it uh its width it's adjusted to the width of your layout so go to the property called layout underscore width or layout colon width and instead of wrap content you can change this width layout width to fill parent and it will fill the parent or the layout okay now the second thing we are going to use here is a text box and we are going to take a large text box and in here we can uh show the progress of the seek bar or what's happening in the seek bar now uh let's go to our main activity. Java and uh let's write some code to to our main activity. Java file so I'm going to go to my main activity. Java so now I'm going to declare two variables one is sear and other is text view okay so now we have declared two variables one is sear and other is text View and let's declare a method which we can call call in our oncreate method so it will be public void seek bar for example and let's uh write some code inside this method and first of all we are going to cast our SE bar and text view variables so let's cast them so now our casting is done and now we will add The Listener to this seek bar but let's uh first set some text on our text view so that uh it can print the progress of uh the seek bar so text view do set text and and inside we can uh just set some text for example covered some amount of seek barar or something like this plus the seek bar variable and we will check the progress so get progress of the seek bar so let's check the progress of the sear and then we will uh show this progress against the maximum uh you know value the sear can show right so let's show it against the maximum value so plus sear dot get Max okay now uh what we are going to do is we are going to take our sear and uh add a listener to this sear so take the sear dot set sear change listener and in here we will add a new uh sear change listener so new on Sear change listener and you will notice that whenever you press enter it adds three method to your on seekbar change listener one is on progress change other is on start tracking touch and third is on stop tracking touch so this one first is for tracking the progress of your sear second is uh tracking the start uh of your SE bar and third one is for tracking the stop of your seek bar okay so now what's uh what we are going to do is uh in this set on click uh change C speak bar listener uh let's create a variable in progress value progress value for example and this we are going to use to uh you know store the progress of this seek bar now we are going to go into this method called on progress change method and in here you can see a variable called progress and this will give you the progress of the seek bar so we will assign this progress to our uh user defined variable which is progress value so progress is equal to progress okay and now uh we will assign this progress to uh the to the text view also okay so what we are going to do here we are we are going to copy uh the same text which we have set on the text view but let's see uh what is this error this error on when we hover over this progress underscore value it says uh the variable progress value is accessed from the inner class that means you should Define this inside your seek Bar Method in here right or better you can do it even inside here okay and then what we are going to do is we will copy this text view. set text and paste it here and instead of this get progress we will just pass this progress variable here okay so this will show us the progress of our sear in the text view okay the same we are going to do in the stop tracking touch because whenever the sear process uh or sear uh drag is stopped we also want to uh you know show this value on the text box but this is store in this uh progress value which is a global variable for these three method so change it to the progress value and then uh we can also uh show some uh text message using toast okay so we will use toast. make text which takes uh three argument first is your class name or your context so main activity dot this second is the message for example seek bar bar in progress okay and let's add the third argument ment toast dot length long and we will show this right the same messages we can add to our other two uh method here one is for start tracking so in here sear we can say start tracking or sear in start tracking and in here we will just add same toast or message and we will say Seek bar in stop tracking okay now uh I think our method is uh done so we just need to call this method inside our oncreate method in here and we just need to run our program so let's run the program so now our program is running and you can see initial status of our seek bar is zero and the maximum value of the seek bar is 100 right so because it's on the left top left end of the you know SE bar that's why our progress is zero right now against 100 now let's uh try to drag this uh thumb towards right and let's see what happens so I drag it and you can see it uh changes uh this um value which is covered and it changes uh the message or toast uh in here right so the process changes and the message here also changes right you can see the process changes and here the message according to the change of the seek bar appears right so in this way you can track the process of seek bar using get process of the get process method of sear and the process method and that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and
