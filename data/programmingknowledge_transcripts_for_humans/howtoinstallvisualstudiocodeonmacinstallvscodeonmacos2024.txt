00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Visual Studio code on your Mac operating
00:07 - system so let's get started and let's
00:09 - see how we can do it so first of all you
00:12 - just need to open your favorite browser
00:14 - and search for visual studio code and
00:16 - the first link which will appear here
00:18 - will be from code dovisual studio.com so
00:21 - we are going to click on this link which
00:23 - will redirect us to this page here you
00:26 - will be able to see uh download Mac
00:29 - universe veral you also have the options
00:32 - for Windows and Linux but we are on the
00:35 - Mac operating system so we can just
00:37 - click on this download button once you
00:40 - click on uh the download button you will
00:43 - see that this Visual Studio code ZIP
00:47 - file will be downloaded so we are going
00:48 - to uh just click on this uh ZIP file
00:52 - which is going to extract this ZIP file
00:55 - and then it's going to look like this so
00:58 - the extracted Visual Studio code code uh
01:00 - icon is visible here so you can directly
01:04 - open Visual Studio code from here so
01:06 - when I click on Visual Studio code it's
01:08 - going to open right but we want to
01:12 - transfer this Visual Studio code
01:15 - application into our applications folder
01:18 - so from the next time we will be able to
01:21 - use that uh from our Launchpad or the
01:25 - applications folder so for that right
01:28 - click on the finder here and then open a
01:30 - new window for the finder and then click
01:33 - on the applications folder and just drag
01:37 - and drop this Visual Studio code
01:39 - application so what you need to do is
01:41 - just select the visual studio code
01:44 - application from here press command key
01:47 - and then drag and drop this uh icon into
01:51 - your applications folder so just drag
01:53 - and drop into the applications folder
01:56 - and now this is copied into the
01:59 - applications folder once you copy the
02:02 - visual studio app in your applications
02:05 - folder you will be able to open the
02:08 - Launchpad and then you will be able to
02:10 - see the visual studio code icon here so
02:14 - from the next time you can open it from
02:18 - the Launchpad now we can close all these
02:23 - things let's launch Visual Studio code
02:26 - from here and when you open the visual
02:28 - studio code it will going to look like
02:31 - this now using visual studio code is
02:34 - really simple if you want to open a
02:36 - directory you can just click on file and
02:39 - then click on open and then open any
02:43 - folder from here you might also want to
02:47 - open the visual studio code using the
02:49 - terminal so when I open the terminal
02:52 - when I click on this uh Spotlight and
02:54 - then search for the terminal and open
02:56 - the terminal and when I give this code
02:59 - command and then press enter it says zsh
03:02 - command not found for the code
03:05 - application so our terminal right now
03:08 - doesn't recognizes the code command so
03:12 - how we can fix this so let me uh quit
03:15 - from this terminal and then what you
03:17 - need to do is just open your Visual
03:20 - Studio code and then press command shift
03:23 - p so press command shift p and then type
03:28 - here shell
03:30 - commands Okay so just type shell command
03:34 - here and you will see two commands one
03:38 - is uninstall code command from path and
03:41 - other is install code command in path so
03:44 - first of all we are going to click on
03:46 - the second option which says uninstall
03:48 - code command in path so I'm going to
03:50 - just uh press on this option and then
03:53 - click on okay once that's done once
03:57 - again press command shift p and then
04:00 - once again write shell command here so
04:04 - shell command and this time press on
04:07 - this option which says install code
04:10 - command in path okay so first uninstall
04:13 - and then click on install code command
04:16 - in path so I'm going to click on this uh
04:19 - option and it says code will now prompt
04:22 - with Osa script for administrator
04:25 - privileges to install the shell command
04:27 - so I'm going to click on okay here
04:30 - and then you need to provide your
04:33 - MacBooks password which you use to log
04:35 - to your Macbook so let me provide that
04:37 - and then press on okay and once that's
04:41 - done you can see shell command code
04:43 - successfully installed in path so once
04:46 - that's done you can open the terminal
04:49 - once again so quit the terminal and when
04:51 - you reopen the terminal again so let me
04:53 - reopen the terminal and then now you
04:57 - will be able to use the code command so
05:00 - when I write code here and then press
05:02 - enter it's going to open the visual
05:05 - studio code so now this is the way to
05:08 - set the path of Visual Studio code in
05:11 - your zsh path so that it recognizes the
05:15 - code command so now let's say let me
05:19 - close this Visual Studio code editor
05:21 - from here and then if I open the
05:24 - terminal and let's say I will CD into my
05:28 - documents folder so let me CD into the
05:31 - documents folder and here I have a few
05:34 - directories and I want to open the my
05:38 - project directory using visual studio
05:40 - code I can just CD into my projects
05:44 - directory and then I can write code
05:46 - space dot which is going to open the my
05:49 - projects directory in the code
05:51 - application so I'm going to press enter
05:53 - and then you can see it opens my project
05:57 - into Visual Studio code and and here you
06:00 - can see it says do you trust the author
06:02 - of the files in the folder I will click
06:06 - yes here and I can also click on this
06:10 - checkbox and if I check this checkbox
06:13 - from the next time it's going to trust
06:15 - the document folder so I'm going to
06:16 - press yes here and now you can see this
06:20 - project is open this project is about uh
06:23 - hello world Java program so you can see
06:26 - uh I can open the hello. Java file when
06:29 - whenever you uh open any program file in
06:33 - Visual Studio code if Visual Studio
06:37 - finds the extension pack for that
06:40 - language it's going to suggest you to
06:42 - install the extension pack for that
06:45 - language as in this case you can see
06:47 - it's recommending us to install the Java
06:50 - language pack so you can install that uh
06:54 - from the extension so here you can see
06:58 - right now we we are in the Explorer you
07:01 - can also search for some words for
07:03 - example I want to search for Hello here
07:07 - so it searches for the hello keyword in
07:10 - all the files in the present directory
07:13 - if I want to replace the word then I can
07:16 - replace also and if you your project
07:19 - contain multiple directories then you
07:22 - can include or exclude the search from a
07:25 - certain directory using these two
07:28 - options if you are using Git Version
07:31 - Control then you can also see the
07:35 - Version Control changes in this git
07:38 - section you also have the debug section
07:41 - and then you also have the extensions
07:43 - section as I mentioned there are some
07:45 - popular extension for each and every
07:47 - language for example you can see this uh
07:51 - python support so if you want to develop
07:53 - python then you can uh install this
07:56 - extension which is from Microsoft
08:00 - itself and it was downloaded around 106
08:04 - million times so it's the most popular
08:06 - for python C++ extension is there and
08:11 - similarly you will find the support for
08:14 - each and every language in the
08:16 - extensions for example if I want to uh
08:19 - search for Java it's going to search for
08:21 - Java pack and then it's going to uh
08:24 - suggest you the extensions related to
08:27 - Java so this is how you can download and
08:29 - install Visual Studio code on your Mac
08:33 - operating system and use it to develop
08:36 - your favorite programming language I
08:39 - hope you've enjoyed this video and I
08:41 - will see you in the next video
