00:00 - hey everyone today we would be talking
00:03 - about radio buttons and check buttons
00:06 - there are another type of widgets they
00:09 - can be used while making a form so this
00:12 - is a very simple program to make it a
00:15 - bit interesting what I would do is I
00:17 - would given commands to these buttons
00:19 - whenever the buttons would be filled in
00:21 - the specified function would be called
00:23 - and the function that I would Define
00:26 - would declare another thinker window and
00:30 - show some message for that I will use
00:33 - canvas widget we have already discussed
00:35 - it in the last video
00:37 - so let's start writing the code for it
00:40 - from Tinker
00:43 - I'll import
00:45 - star
00:46 - and I'll have my window master window
00:49 - I'll write when TK
00:52 - brackets
00:53 - I will also give in a title I'll write
00:56 - win DOT type 2.
00:59 - the title be
01:01 - radio buttons
01:07 - then I will have an INT variable
01:11 - so I'll write V equals into r
01:15 - so this interval would be used to
01:17 - control the variable value for the radio
01:21 - button or check buttons
01:23 - it would be used to set its current
01:26 - value option
01:28 - now this entire function can hold
01:30 - integer data where we can set integer
01:34 - data and we can even retrieve it using
01:36 - the cater and Setter methods
01:38 - for right now just remember that V into
01:41 - one is used to set the value of radio
01:44 - button or check button okay now I will
01:47 - have my radio button I'll write radio
01:49 - button
01:50 - foreign
01:53 - button on the window so I'll write win
01:56 - and the text that I want is
01:59 - radio button one
02:07 - and variable I will given to be V
02:12 - and let the active background be
02:16 - pink
02:18 - and active foreground
02:20 - the purple
02:24 - and the command
02:26 - I told you I'll be giving in a command
02:29 - so the command name would be free
02:32 - okay so I'll Define the spray what pre
02:36 - would do is it would show up another
02:39 - window with the text value accepted
02:42 - now how I would do this I would use
02:44 - canvas and create text function by
02:47 - canvas so I'll write wind equals TK
02:51 - here I have another window for tinker
02:55 - I'll write C equals canvas where I want
02:59 - the canvas I want it on the window so
03:01 - I've given wind
03:03 - and background color let's be light
03:05 - cream
03:10 - then I'll pack this canvas I'll write C
03:14 - dot pack
03:19 - then I will create text I'll write C dot
03:24 - create text
03:26 - that the coordinates be hundred comma 10
03:31 - let the text be value accepted
03:41 - I'll fill in with purple
03:48 - then the font that B16
03:52 - cool then I'll run the main Loop I'll
03:55 - write wind dot main Loop
03:58 - okay
04:00 - now let's get back to the main
04:02 - code
04:05 - we have given three as command and now I
04:08 - will use grid for this
04:10 - because I want the radio buttons in a
04:14 - specific line or a row so I'll write dot
04:17 - grid row equals 0.
04:23 - I will have another radio button
04:27 - so I'll write V2 equals integar
04:31 - radio button
04:35 - then
04:43 - two
04:45 - variable
04:48 - letter pv2
04:51 - active background
04:54 - let's keep it the same as above
05:00 - then command free
05:02 - same and for grid now the row number
05:05 - would be 1 because I want it in the next
05:08 - line so I'll write dot grid
05:11 - row equals 1.
05:15 - similarly you can have the check buttons
05:17 - they are very similar
05:19 - it's just the difference of the symbol
05:22 - so I'll have variable one equals into r
05:26 - check button
05:33 - window where I want it I want it on the
05:36 - window
05:37 - and text
05:39 - check button
05:43 - one
05:44 - variable is
05:47 - wire one
05:50 - and again I'll given grid I'll not pack
05:52 - this I'll use grid
05:55 - and row Let It Be
05:59 - 3
06:00 - if you're given the same row number then
06:03 - the things would overlap and you would
06:05 - not be able to see the radio buttons so
06:09 - given a
06:10 - number greater than one or zero
06:15 - then I'll have another variable
06:19 - water to print wire check button when
06:25 - text equals
06:28 - check button
06:30 - to
06:32 - variable
06:34 - wire to
06:36 - and grid
06:38 - row
06:42 - then I can run the main Loop
06:45 - I'll write when dot main Loop
06:48 - so let's run this and let's see if
06:51 - everything works as we have defined it
06:54 - if we can call on to 3 as we given the
06:57 - value for radio buttons
07:04 - so I can see the radio buttons and check
07:07 - buttons on the window
07:09 - and when I click on the check buttons
07:12 - they get checked nothing else happens
07:15 - but when I click on the radio buttons
07:18 - I can see another window popping up with
07:21 - value accepted
07:23 - message and
07:25 - same as with the other radio button if I
07:28 - click on it I can see another window
07:32 - so we could actually given the command
07:37 - and execute it properly
07:39 - so giving in this command also helped
07:42 - you in practicing canvas once
07:44 - that's it about radio buttons and check
07:47 - buttons
07:48 - you can check out once what all
07:51 - arguments we could give to radio buttons
07:53 - or check buttons
07:55 - thank you

I will have another radio button so I'll write V2 equals integar radio button then two variable letter pv2 active background let's keep it the same as above then command free same and for grid now the row number would be 1 because I want it in the next line so I'll write dot grid row equals 1. similarly you can have the check buttons they are very similar it's just the difference of the symbol so I'll have variable one equals into r check button window where I want it I want it on the window and text check button one variable is wire one and again I'll given grid I'll not pack this I'll use grid and row Let It Be 3 if you're given the same row number then the things would overlap and you would not be able to see the radio buttons so given a number greater than one or zero then I'll have another variable water to print wire check button when text equals check button to variable wire to and grid row then I can run the main Loop I'll write when dot main Loop so let's run this and let's see if everything works as we have defined it if we can call on to 3 as we given the value for radio buttons so I can see the radio buttons and check buttons on the window and when I click on the check buttons they get checked nothing else happens but when I click on the radio buttons I can see another window popping up with value accepted message and same as with the other radio button if I click on it I can see another window so we could actually given the command and execute it properly so giving in this command also helped you in practicing canvas once that's it about radio buttons and check buttons you can check out once what all arguments we could give to radio buttons or check buttons thank you
