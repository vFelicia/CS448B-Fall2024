00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install and configure
00:04 - git and github on your urban to
00:06 - operating system so I'm going to show
00:09 - you how to install gate how to configure
00:11 - it with github how to clone repositories
00:13 - how to commit your changes to get and
00:17 - then upload it to github so let's get
00:20 - started so first of all open your
00:22 - favorite browser we are just going to
00:23 - see in the official website how we can
00:25 - install get on Ubuntu so just search for
00:29 - gate and the first link which will
00:31 - appear here will be from gate - SCM comm
00:35 - this is the official web site so we are
00:36 - going to click on that and once this
00:39 - website is open you will directly see
00:41 - the Downloads button here which says
00:44 - downloads for Linux so I'm going to
00:46 - click on that and you will see this is
00:49 - this very simple command which we can
00:51 - use to install git so we are going to
00:55 - just use this apt-get install git
00:58 - command in order to install git so I'm
01:00 - going to just minimize my browser and
01:02 - open the terminal and once the terminal
01:05 - is open first of all just provide sudo
01:08 - command and then just paste this command
01:12 - which says apt - get install gate and
01:14 - you can also give this flag - Y which
01:19 - will surpass all the questions which
01:23 - will be asked by this command line so
01:25 - I'm going to press ENTER and then I'm
01:27 - going to give my open to pass word and
01:29 - then press Enter and then the
01:31 - installation will start so now the
01:33 - installation for gate is finished so we
01:36 - can check the gate version so I'm going
01:39 - to clear the terminal first of all and
01:41 - let's check the gate version gate - -
01:44 - version just give this command to know
01:47 - the version which you have installed for
01:50 - gate and this is the latest version
01:51 - which I have installed on my Ubuntu
01:54 - operating system now before we start
01:56 - using the gate commands let's just set
02:00 - up the github account and let's see how
02:04 - we can create a repository in github and
02:06 - then we are going to commit some changes
02:08 - to the github so once again open your
02:11 - favorite browser and search for github
02:13 - and then the first link which will
02:16 - appear here will be from github com so
02:18 - I'm going to click on this and if you
02:21 - are new to github you can sign up into
02:25 - github by giving the username your email
02:29 - address and your password so these are
02:31 - the three things you require in order to
02:34 - create and sign up into github I have
02:37 - already signed up into github and you
02:39 - just need to verify your email address
02:41 - just a normal stuff which you need to do
02:45 - with any other website and once you do
02:47 - this and you have verified your email
02:50 - address you can sign in to the github so
02:53 - I'm going to click on this button which
02:54 - says sign in and here you can either
02:57 - provide your email address or username
03:00 - so I'm going to provide my username and
03:03 - I'm going to provide my password and I'm
03:05 - going to just click sign in which is
03:07 - going to log me into my github account
03:11 - now here you will see this kind of
03:14 - interface I have already created some
03:17 - repositories on the github that's why
03:20 - you see some repositories but if you
03:23 - have just signed in you will not see
03:24 - anything here and what you need to do
03:27 - first of all is you need to start a new
03:30 - project so you can just click on this
03:33 - button which say start a new project or
03:35 - you can click on this button which says
03:37 - new repository so let's click on the new
03:41 - repository button and once you click on
03:44 - the new repository you will be asked to
03:46 - give the name of your new repository so
03:50 - let's say I want to create a repository
03:53 - for my Java program so I'm going to just
03:56 - say Java program which will be the name
03:58 - of my repository and then you can give
04:01 - the small description about your
04:03 - repository it's optional so I'm going to
04:06 - just say Java programs to learn and then
04:09 - you will see these two options one is
04:11 - public and another is private public
04:14 - repository is the one which is free so
04:17 - you can see anyone can see this
04:19 - repository you choose who can commit and
04:22 - the other one is private and in this
04:24 - repository you choose who can see and
04:27 - made to this repository so we are going
04:30 - to choose the public repository because
04:32 - private repository we need to you know
04:35 - pay something for that so I'm going to
04:38 - choose the public one for now and then
04:40 - you can also choose if you want to have
04:43 - readme file into your repository so I'm
04:45 - going to just check this checkbox and
04:48 - here you will be able to see two options
04:51 - one is the license so there are plenty
04:56 - of license given here you can choose
04:59 - whatever license you want to have for
05:01 - your repository let's say I want to have
05:03 - MIT license for this repository and also
05:06 - you can see this section which says add
05:09 - dot get ignore right now it's none and
05:12 - I'm going to leave it as none but let's
05:15 - see what are the options here for us so
05:17 - you can see you have all these options
05:19 - for your key to ignore so for now I'm
05:21 - going to just say none here and I'm
05:24 - going to just press on the create
05:25 - repository button which is going to
05:28 - create my repository and you can see now
05:31 - my repository is created and this is the
05:34 - small description I have given for my
05:36 - repository and this will be the readme
05:38 - file and the license we have chosen is
05:42 - the MIT license so you can see this here
05:46 - shows MIT license so our repository is
05:48 - created so we can start using the kit
05:52 - for github so I'm going to minimize this
05:55 - browser and the first thing we will do
05:57 - here is to configure our gate to work
06:01 - with github so first of all I'm going to
06:03 - give this command which is going to
06:05 - configure my username I'm also going to
06:08 - copy all the command which I'm writing
06:11 - here in the description of this video so
06:13 - you can always copy them and paste it
06:15 - into your terminal and use them so get
06:18 - config - - global and then space user
06:24 - dot name and in the double quotes you
06:28 - just need to provide your username so on
06:31 - the github my username is P knowledge
06:34 - you can see here you will be able to see
06:36 - your username just after github.com
06:39 - forward slash
06:41 - is your username you will be able to see
06:43 - it here or you can see your username
06:46 - here also so this is your username so
06:50 - I'm going to just provide the same
06:52 - username which I have on github on to
06:56 - the terminal inside these double quotes
06:58 - which is P knowledge and then press
07:00 - Enter
07:01 - so this is going to register my github
07:04 - username on to the gate same way we are
07:08 - going to configure the email address so
07:11 - just write get config - - global user
07:14 - dot email and then just provide whatever
07:19 - email you have used for your github
07:23 - account so I'm going to give my email
07:25 - address and then press Enter
07:27 - now in order to list whatever
07:29 - configuration you have for your agate
07:32 - you can give this command git config and
07:36 - - - list and then press enter and you
07:41 - can see I have given to configuration
07:43 - till now and both are listed here if you
07:47 - want to see where this file is located
07:49 - on your open to operating system where
07:51 - these informations are saved then you
07:55 - need to go to your home directory right
07:57 - now I'm in my home directory you can see
08:00 - this is my home directory and in your
08:04 - home directory there will be a file
08:05 - called git config so I'm going to do LS
08:10 - - al here to list all the files and the
08:14 - file we are searching for is this one
08:16 - which is gate config so we need to open
08:20 - this file I'm going to use G add it to
08:24 - open this file you can open this file
08:26 - with any other editor and then I'm going
08:29 - to just say dot gate config and then
08:32 - press Enter which is going to open this
08:35 - file in my editor and you will be able
08:38 - to see all the configurations you have
08:40 - done for your gate account and now we
08:43 - are ready to use gate with github so I'm
08:47 - going to clear the terminal and let's
08:50 - say I want to clone the repository which
08:53 - I have created which is Java program
08:55 - on my Obon to operating system so just
08:58 - go to the directory wherever you want to
09:00 - clone your repository so I'm going to
09:02 - create one directory with this command
09:05 - mkdir and let's say I'm going to just
09:09 - say get workspace here and I'm going to
09:12 - just click enter is going to create this
09:15 - repository so I'm going to just CD to
09:18 - get workspace and let's say here I want
09:21 - to clone my repository so to clone the
09:25 - repository you just need to go to your
09:26 - github account and just go to the
09:29 - repository which you have created and
09:31 - here you will be able to see this green
09:34 - button which says clone or download so
09:37 - I'm going to click on this option and
09:38 - here you will be able to see the URL to
09:41 - clone your repository so you just need
09:44 - to copy this URL which is given into
09:47 - this box and then I'm going to minimize
09:50 - my browser and you just need to give
09:53 - this command here so git clone and then
09:57 - whatever URL you have copied for your
10:00 - repository which is this one and I'm
10:02 - going to press Enter which is going to
10:04 - clone this Java program repository from
10:08 - my github account into this directory so
10:11 - let's provide LS command once again and
10:13 - you can see this Java programs
10:15 - repository is cloned into my folder
10:19 - wherever I have cloned it so let's CD to
10:23 - the Java programs directory and let's do
10:26 - LS here and you can see both the files
10:29 - you have a scene in your a github
10:33 - repository so there will be a license
10:35 - file and there will be read dot MD file
10:39 - into this directory which we have
10:42 - already created so let's create a Java
10:46 - file in which we want to write our hello
10:48 - world program and we want to commit this
10:51 - Java file into the github so I'm going
10:54 - to just say touch and then I'm going to
10:57 - just say hello world dot java and then
11:01 - press enter and i'm going to do LS and
11:04 - you can see this HelloWorld dot Java
11:06 - file is created
11:08 - and in order to open it I'm going to
11:10 - just do G added command and then
11:14 - HelloWorld dot Java and now what I'm
11:17 - going to do here is I'm going to just
11:19 - paste a simple hello world Java program
11:22 - here and I'm going to save this file and
11:24 - I'm going to close this so now this
11:27 - hello world Java program is there into
11:29 - my HelloWorld dot Java file now let's
11:33 - say I want to just commit this Java file
11:36 - into my gate and then I want to transfer
11:40 - this file to my github account so first
11:43 - of all we will see what is the status of
11:46 - our repository by this command just give
11:49 - git status and this is going to show you
11:52 - the status of your repository and you
11:55 - can see this option which says hello
11:58 - world in red and it will give you some
12:02 - useful information and this says use git
12:06 - add filename to include it into your
12:10 - commit so I'm going to just write this
12:13 - command get add and then the file name
12:17 - so I want to add this file to my gate so
12:21 - just write get add and then your a file
12:24 - name which is going to add this file to
12:27 - the git and once again provide the git
12:30 - status command and now you will see this
12:33 - file name which is hollow world or Java
12:34 - in green this means now this is the part
12:38 - of gate so we just need to commit this
12:41 - file into our gate so to commit this you
12:43 - can just write gate commit and then
12:46 - minus M which is the option to provide
12:49 - the comment so you can just write first
12:52 - Java program here so this is this will
12:56 - be the comment for your commit and then
12:59 - give your file name which is HelloWorld
13:02 - dot Java so I'm going to just give my
13:04 - file name which I want to commit and
13:06 - then press enter and you will be able to
13:08 - see this kind of message which means
13:10 - that your file is committed but
13:13 - committing doesn't mean that it will be
13:15 - available on your github account so when
13:18 - i refresh my github repository
13:21 - you will see the same two files so I
13:24 - want to see my third file which is
13:26 - helloworld.java so in order to push this
13:29 - file into your github account you just
13:32 - need to give this command gate push - u
13:36 - space or region master and then press
13:40 - Enter but first of all you just need to
13:42 - give your username my username is P
13:44 - knowledge and then I'm going to press
13:46 - enter and then give your github password
13:49 - whatever you have set for your github
13:52 - you need to give that password here so
13:54 - I'm going to give my github x' parts
13:57 - password here and then press enter and
14:00 - you will see all the files will be
14:02 - transferred to your github repository
14:06 - which is this one so now let's check on
14:08 - our github account and you can see for
14:12 - now there are two files here because I
14:14 - haven't refreshed this webpage and when
14:17 - I will refresh this webpage there will
14:20 - be a third file which is HelloWorld dot
14:22 - Java file and in this HelloWorld dot
14:25 - Java file or HelloWorld program is there
14:28 - so this is how you can commit and push
14:31 - your changes to your github account so
14:34 - this was the brief introduction about
14:36 - how to install and configure gate and

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and configure git and github on your urban to operating system so I'm going to show you how to install gate how to configure it with github how to clone repositories how to commit your changes to get and then upload it to github so let's get started so first of all open your favorite browser we are just going to see in the official website how we can install get on Ubuntu so just search for gate and the first link which will appear here will be from gate SCM comm this is the official web site so we are going to click on that and once this website is open you will directly see the Downloads button here which says downloads for Linux so I'm going to click on that and you will see this is this very simple command which we can

first of all just provide sudo command and then just paste this command which says apt get install gate and you can also give this flag Y which will surpass all the questions which will be asked by this command line so I'm going to press ENTER and then I'm going to give my open to pass word and then press Enter and then the installation will start so now the installation for gate is finished so we can check the gate version so I'm going to clear the terminal first of all and let's check the gate version gate version just give this command to know the version which you have installed for gate and this is the latest version which I have installed on my Ubuntu operating system now before we start using the gate commands let's just set up the github account and let's see how we can create a repository in github and then we are going to commit some changes to the github so once again open your favorite browser and search for github and then the first link which will appear here will be from github com so I'm going to click on this and if you are new to github you can sign up into github by giving the username your email address and your password so these are the three things you require in order to create and sign up into github I have already signed up into github and you just need to verify your email address just a normal stuff which you need to do with any other website and once you do this and you have verified your email address you can sign in to the github so I'm going to click on this button which says sign in and here you can either provide your email address or username so I'm going to provide my username and I'm going to provide my password and I'm going to just click sign in which is going to log me into my github account now here you will see this kind of interface I have already created some repositories on the github that's why you see some repositories but if you have just signed in you will not see anything here and what you need to do first of all is you need to start a new project so you can just click on this button which say start a new project or you can click on this button which says new repository so let's click on the new repository button and once you click on the new repository you will be asked to give the name of your new repository so let's say I want to create a repository for my Java program so I'm going to just say Java program which will be the name of my repository and then you can give the small description about your repository it's optional so I'm going to just say Java programs to learn and then you will see these two options one is public and another is private public repository is the one which is free so you can see anyone can see this repository you choose who can commit and the other one is private and in this repository you choose who can see and made to this repository so we are going to choose the public repository because private repository we need to you know pay something for that so I'm going to choose the public one for now and then you can also choose if you want to have readme file into your repository so I'm going to just check this checkbox and here you will be able to see two options one is the license so there are plenty of license given here you can choose whatever license you want to have for your repository let's say I want to have MIT license for this repository and also you can see this section which says add dot get ignore right now it's none and I'm going to leave it as none but let's see what are the options here for us so you can see you have all these options for your key to ignore so for now I'm going to just say none here and I'm going to just press on the create repository button which is going to create my repository and you can see now my repository is created and this is the small description I have given for my repository and this will be the readme file and the license we have chosen is the MIT license so you can see this here shows MIT license so our repository is created so we can start using the kit for github so I'm going to minimize this browser and the first thing we will do here is to configure our gate to work with github so first of all I'm going to give this command which is going to configure my username I'm also going to copy all the command which I'm writing here in the description of this video so you can always

P knowledge you can see here you will be able to see your username just after github.com forward slash is your username you will be able to see it here or you can see your username here also so this is your username so I'm going to just provide the same username which I have on github on to the terminal inside these double quotes which is P knowledge and then press Enter so this is going to register my github username on to the gate same way we are going to configure the email address so just write get config global user dot email and then just provide whatever email you have used for your github account so I'm going to give my email address and then press Enter now in order to list whatever configuration you have for your agate you can give this command git config and list and then press enter and you can see I have given to configuration till now and both are listed here if you want to see where this file is located on your open to operating system where these informations
