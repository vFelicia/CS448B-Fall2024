00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install open CV on your
00:05 - Visual Studio code editor on your Mac
00:07 - operating system so let's say you want
00:09 - to uh develop an open CV python script
00:14 - and for that you need to install the
00:16 - open CB package using pip so let's see
00:20 - how we can do it so as you can see I
00:22 - have opened the sample folder inside my
00:24 - visual studio code editor and I'm going
00:27 - to create a test file here so let me
00:29 - create this test.py file and then I'm
00:32 - going to paste a very simple uh open CV
00:36 - script so when you want to develop an
00:40 - open CV application you need to import
00:43 - the CV2 uh package when I uh use this
00:48 - script and when I hover over this import
00:51 - it says import CV2 could not be resolved
00:55 - because we haven't installed the open CV
00:58 - package so for in installing open CV
01:00 - package I'm going to click on Terminal
01:02 - and then click on new terminal and then
01:05 - I'm going to create a virtual
01:06 - environment so that when I install the
01:09 - open CV it only installs in the current
01:11 - project and not globally on my Mac
01:14 - operating system to create a virtual M
01:17 - just type Python and then press tab on
01:21 - your uh uh keyboard what it's going to
01:24 - do is it's going to autocomplete your
01:27 - python uh command in my case Python 3 uh
01:31 - is available and python 3.12 is also
01:35 - available so you can choose one of these
01:38 - uh python version as I as you can see I
01:41 - have Python 3 and python 3.12 I'm going
01:43 - to choose Python 3 and then I'm going to
01:46 - write hyphen n and then VN and then the
01:50 - name of the environment I'm going to
01:52 - name my environment as andv you can name
01:55 - it
01:56 - anything now just press enter which is
01:59 - going to create a virtual EnV and you
02:01 - can see my EnV directory is created and
02:05 - here I also have other uh
02:08 - directories now I need to enable the
02:11 - virtual EnV to enable or activate the
02:14 - virtual EnV I need to call this script
02:17 - which is under n and then in bin I have
02:21 - this activate script to activate just
02:25 - write Source here and then write n or
02:29 - whatever name uh you see here for your
02:32 - NV and then forward slash bin for slash
02:38 - activate and then press enter it's going
02:41 - to activate your virtual environment and
02:43 - to uh see if the environment is
02:46 - activated you will see this environment
02:48 - name in front of the command line once
02:51 - that's done we are ready to install the
02:53 - open CV package so just type pip and
02:56 - then press Tab Key on your keyboard and
02:59 - you will see all the PIP related
03:01 - packages on your Mac operating system
03:03 - I'm going to use pip 3 but you can use
03:06 - other version of pip which are listed
03:08 - here so pip 3 install and then the
03:13 - package we want to install is open CV
03:16 - python it's not CV2 CV2 comes under open
03:20 - CV python package so just type pip
03:23 - install open CV hyen python press enter
03:27 - which is going to install this open CV
03:30 - uh package and once this open CV package
03:32 - is installed you can see the error over
03:36 - this CV2 package is gone open CV also
03:40 - comes with the version of numpy and as
03:43 - my script is also using numpy it also
03:46 - doesn't show any error once the PIP
03:49 - package is installed let me clear the
03:52 - terminal and then I can run my script as
03:55 - Python 3 and then space the name of the
03:58 - script file which is test.py file in my
04:01 - case you can see the name of the file is
04:04 - test.py I'm going to press enter here
04:06 - which is going to run my open CV script
04:10 - and you can see it has shown me this uh
04:13 - output which is using the open
04:16 - CV so this is how you can install open
04:19 - CV on your Visual Studio code editor on
04:22 - your Mac operating system I hope you
04:24 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
04:26 - the next video
