02:51 - the flavor which we have installed and
02:53 - then - 64-bit right and the extension is
02:57 - ISO file so once you have downloaded
03:00 - this ISO file we are ready to create the
03:02 - virtual machine so just open your
03:03 - VirtualBox manager and then click on the
03:06 - new button here and then just give the
03:09 - name to your Linux Mint virtual machine
03:11 - I'm going to just give the same name
03:13 - which is Linux Mint here the type is
03:17 - Linux here you can choose this type from
03:20 - this drop-down menu and the version is
03:24 - Linux Mint but this version is not
03:27 - available in this list so the closest
03:31 - one is Ubuntu 64-bit so I'm going to
03:33 - choose Ubuntu 64-bit from here and the
03:37 - machine folder also you can choose the
03:41 - location by default this will be saved
03:44 - in your a/c directory but if you want to
03:47 - change the destination here you can just
03:51 - choose other and then choose the
03:53 - location where you want to just save
03:56 - this Linux Mint virtual machine so I
03:59 - have chosen this location manually and
04:02 - then click on next and then on this next
04:05 - window you can choose the memory size so
04:07 - I just like to drag this track bar up to
04:10 - the end of the green level this depends
04:13 - upon the memory in your host machine and
04:17 - now I'm going to just click on next and
04:19 - on the next window just leave everything
04:21 - as default and then click on create and
04:24 - on the hard disk file type just
04:26 - everything is default the default one is
04:29 - VDI or virtual disk image and then click
04:32 - on next on the storage on physical hard
04:34 - drive window just choose dynamically
04:36 - allocated if you want to read more about
04:38 - the difference between dynamically

04:42 - this difference here just choose this
04:47 - option and then click on next and on the
04:50 - next window you will see the file
04:52 - location and the size so just leave this
04:55 - file location as default or if you want
04:58 - to change it you can change it from here
04:59 - and the hard disk size so let's say I
05:03 - just want to allocate around 100 GB to
05:07 - my Linux Mint machine and then I'm going
05:10 - to click on create which is going to
05:12 - create this Linux Mint virtual machine
05:15 - on my VirtualBox now before starting
05:18 - this virtual machine you need to do some
05:21 - more settings so just select Linux Mint
05:23 - and then click on settings here and then
05:26 - go to general and then in the general go
05:29 - to advanced and then just choose
05:32 - bidirectional for the shared clipboard
05:36 - and drag-drop options ok this will allow
05:39 - you to drag and drop files from your
05:41 - host machine to your virtual machine and
05:44 - also you can copy and paste text in both
05:49 - directions now just select system and in
05:54 - the processors by default VirtualBox
05:56 - allocate one processor to your virtual
05:58 - machine you can move it to use more
06:01 - processors
06:02 - I generally move it to the end of the
06:06 - green level which is for in my case and
06:09 - then I'm going to go to the storage

10:38 - to click on the restart Now button ok so
10:41 - I'm going to just click on restart now
10:43 - which is going to restart my virtual

11:13 - desktop so I'm going to just cancel this
11:16 - and I can also just close this welcome
11:20 - window now here I will try to expand
11:23 - this Linux Mint desktop according to the
11:26 - size of my Windows desktop screen and
11:32 - you can see straight away this desktop
11:34 - doesn't resize according to the size of
11:37 - my host desktop size so to solve this
11:42 - problem you need to install VirtualBox
11:45 - guest additions on your Linux Mint so
11:48 - for that what you need to do is just go
11:51 - to devices here and then click on insert
11:54 - guest additions CD image just click on

12:13 - authenticate which is going to start the
12:16 - installation of VirtualBox guest
12:18 - additions on your virtual machine which
12:23 - is Linux Mint in my case so just let it
12:26 - run until it finishes and now after some
12:29 - time you will see this prompt at the end
12:32 - which says press return to close this

12:46 - manually so just click on this menu here
12:49 - and then click on this power button and
12:51 - then click on shutdown so your Linux
12:55 - Mint virtual machine will shut down you
12:58 - can just once again restart your Linux
13:00 - Mint by just clicking on the start
13:02 - button and now when you resize your
13:05 - Linux
13:06 - it's going to resize according to your
13:08 - host machine window and now you can
13:12 - start working with the Linux Mint so
