00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:05 - this video we will learn what is
00:07 - Javascript and how does it work and if
00:10 - the time permits we will also see how we
00:13 - can write our first JavaScript code so
00:16 - first of all what is Javascript
00:19 - JavaScript is a highlevel dynamic
00:22 - untyped and interpreted programming
00:25 - language and alongside HTML and CSS it
00:28 - is one of the three three most essential
00:31 - Technologies of worldwide web content
00:35 - production now if you are using HTML and
00:38 - CSS most probably you are generating
00:41 - only static Pages for your website and
00:46 - what is static static means there is no
00:49 - interactivity in your web page you can
00:52 - only uh produce text images tables and
00:57 - Frames but there is no interactivity
01:01 - involved in your web page now JavaScript
01:05 - is just for that so JavaScript allows
01:08 - you to add
01:10 - interactivity with your web page so for
01:13 - example you want to uh add a user and
01:17 - you want the user to log in to your
01:20 - website before accessing your content so
01:24 - this can be added through JavaScript
01:27 - right or you can use JavaScript to
01:31 - manipulate the actions of the user for
01:34 - example he clicks something and he wants
01:37 - to calculate the values of something for
01:40 - example addition of two numbers you can
01:42 - do it with JavaScript very easily now if
01:46 - you're thinking JavaScript is a very
01:49 - difficult language to learn it's not
01:51 - it's really easy to learn and it was
01:55 - developed by net Netscape first okay now
02:00 - what is the meaning of interactivity I
02:03 - Will Show You by example so for example
02:07 - I have this temperature converter let's
02:10 - see on the actual web page how it looks
02:12 - like so this is a temperature converter
02:15 - right now all this is right now HTML and
02:20 - CSS and for example I want to convert a
02:24 - Celsius value into a Fahrenheit and
02:27 - Kelvin I need to use the JavaScript or
02:31 - in fact I'm using JavaScript in this web
02:34 - page to calculate these values for so
02:37 - for example I add 5° cus here and I want
02:41 - to calculate the respective value of
02:43 - Fahrenheit and Kelvin I can just click
02:46 - this convert button and JavaScript does
02:49 - it magic and it converts it and it shows
02:53 - it here so this is the magic of
02:55 - JavaScript okay now not only not only
03:00 - JavaScript calculates something but it
03:02 - improves the appearance of your web page
03:06 - especially if you're using Graphics or
03:09 - visual feedback it can also make your
03:13 - site navigation easier and interactive
03:16 - and as I already said that it can
03:19 - perform calculations and validation
03:22 - validation means just for example
03:25 - login page of your website right so how
03:29 - how does it work it can be embedded into
03:33 - your HTML page so you can directly embed
03:37 - script element into your HTML uh code
03:41 - and you can use JavaScript otherwise you
03:44 - can create a Javascript file and add it
03:48 - into your HTML page okay now JavaScript
03:53 - is executed on the client side so it's
03:57 - fast and once it's loaded no connection
04:00 - is needed from the server to execute or
04:03 - to make it work okay now it use a simple
04:08 - programming statement combined with HTML
04:12 - tag and as I already said it's an
04:15 - interpreted language now there are two
04:18 - type of languages one is a compiled
04:22 - language and other is a interpreted
04:25 - language compiled language is a one when
04:29 - you compile it first and create a binary
04:33 - of it and when you execute this binary
04:36 - it will work but the interpreted means
04:40 - for example JavaScript is a interpreted
04:42 - language so we don't need to compile it
04:45 - but it can be used directly on the
04:48 - browser and it can be interpreted by the
04:51 - browser so you can say browser
04:54 - interprets it and if it's valid then it
04:57 - will be shown to the user right right
05:00 - now some people thinks that Java and
05:03 - javascripts are almost same but they are
05:06 - not Java and javascripts are totally
05:10 - different languages okay so for example
05:13 - what is Java Java is a full programming
05:16 - language which is much harder to learn
05:20 - and it's a compiled language and it's
05:23 - independent of web so you can use Java
05:26 - with web Technologies but it's not
05:29 - necessary that you have to use web
05:32 - Technologies with Java it can you know
05:35 - do its stuff on its own without any web
05:40 - technology right on the other hand
05:43 - JavaScript is a interpreted language
05:46 - which has its own syntax and what we
05:49 - need to uh code JavaScript one is the
05:53 - text editor and other is the browser
05:57 - okay so you can choose any browser of
05:59 - your choice and the text editor for
06:01 - example you can use notepad or wordpad
06:04 - which comes with Windows or you can use
06:07 - notepad++ which is a little bit more
06:10 - advanced version of notepad or you can
06:13 - use some IDE like eclipse or net beans
06:17 - or intellig idea or there are many idees
06:23 - IDE stand for integrated development
06:25 - environment which you can use to code
06:28 - JavaScript
06:30 - okay now if you want to learn JavaScript
06:33 - most probably you need to revise your
06:35 - HTML skills right so because we use
06:39 - JavaScript mostly with HTML so you need
06:42 - to have some idea of HTML also okay now
06:47 - this is a small example of a JavaScript
06:51 - code so you have HTML and you can add
06:56 - JavaScript code inside this HTML page
06:59 - page so let's see how we can do it so I
07:02 - have this sample HTML code and for
07:05 - example I want to add this uh JavaScript
07:08 - code inside it what I can do here is I
07:11 - can add a script tag here and just add
07:15 - this type is equal to
07:17 - text/javascript so it knows which type
07:19 - of language it is which is Javascript
07:22 - right and in here to uh for example I
07:26 - want to print something on the web page
07:29 - I can use
07:31 - document. write so document. write and
07:34 - here I can just write for example hello
07:38 - world and don't forget to give the
07:40 - semicolon here and I will save it and I
07:42 - will go to the web page on which I want
07:44 - to execute it and refresh my web page
07:47 - and it so shows hello world okay now for
07:51 - example I want to add some HTML tags
07:55 - inside this document I can do it easily
07:58 - just add for example H1 tag at the start
08:03 - and ending tag at the last which is same
08:07 - and save your code and refresh your web
08:11 - page and it's showing it in the H1 tags
08:15 - okay so you can use JavaScript like this
08:19 - now we will learn more how we can use
08:23 - JavaScript and how we can uh you know
08:26 - create interactive web pages using
08:28 - JavaScript in the further videos so stay
08:31 - tuned and please rate comment and
08:32 - subscribe and bye for now
