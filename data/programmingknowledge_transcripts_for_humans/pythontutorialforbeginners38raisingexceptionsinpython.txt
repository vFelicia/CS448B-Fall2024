00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last few videos we have seen how to
00:06 - handle exceptions in Python now in this
00:10 - video I'm going to show you how to raise
00:12 - an exception in Python now raising an
00:16 - exception is similar to threw an error
00:19 - or exception in the languages like Java
00:23 - or C++ so Python allows us to use a
00:27 - keyword called raise and that raised
00:31 - statement or keyword allows the
00:34 - programmer to force a specific exception
00:38 - to occur so let's get started and let's
00:41 - see this raised statement with an
00:43 - example so to start with I have created
00:46 - a class called coffee cup which have a
00:49 - init method which takes one argument
00:52 - which is the temperature and I'm just
00:55 - initializing the value of temperature
00:56 - using this init method and this coffee
00:59 - cup class also have one more method
01:02 - which is called drink coffee and inside
01:05 - this drink coffee method I have some
01:07 - conditions so if the temperature is
01:10 - greater than 85 then I print coffee is
01:14 - too hot if the temperature is less than
01:16 - 65 then I print coffee is too cold and
01:20 - if the temperature is between 65 and 85
01:25 - then I print that coffee is okay and
01:29 - here I have created an instance of
01:32 - coffee cup class with an argument which
01:35 - is 75 to start with and I'm just calling
01:38 - this method drink coffee from this
01:40 - object so let's run the code and let's
01:42 - see what happens
01:43 - so because the 75 is neither satisfying
01:46 - this condition nor this condition so the
01:50 - answer which is printed here is coffee
01:53 - okay to drink now when I provide for
01:56 - example 101 temperature value here and
02:00 - when I run the code once again it will
02:02 - say coffee to hot if I say coffee
02:06 - temperature is 10 it says coffee to cold
02:10 - now in these two switch
02:12 - patience when the coffee is too hot or
02:15 - the coffee is too cold I can also throw
02:18 - an exception and show the user some kind
02:22 - of message so instead of printing that
02:25 - coffee is too hot I can use a keyword
02:28 - called raise and then I can use any
02:32 - class of exception so we can use the
02:36 - exception class or any subclass of
02:39 - exception and you can see this exception
02:42 - class comes in this built-in module so
02:45 - I'm going to just use this exception
02:47 - which is the base class and same I'm
02:51 - going to do here when the coffee is cold
02:55 - and I'm going to comment these two print
02:58 - statements and now when I run the code
03:02 - it throws an exception without any error
03:05 - so it throws an exception and after that
03:07 - the execution of program stops so right
03:11 - now temperature is 10 which satisfies
03:15 - this condition so this exception is
03:18 - thrown and that's why we see this
03:20 - exception so in Python we can throw an
03:23 - exception using this keyword race and
03:27 - this exception class or any subclass of
03:30 - this exception class now in the last
03:32 - video also I have shown you how to see
03:35 - all the subclasses which are under the
03:37 - exception class to see them you can just
03:40 - open your Python console and in the
03:43 - Python Python console you just need to
03:46 - import militants and then press Enter
03:49 - and now you use a method called help and
03:54 - inside the help method you use this
03:57 - keyword built-ins and then press Enter
04:00 - which is going to give you a big list
04:02 - here and when you scroll up at the top
04:05 - you will see classes here and under the
04:07 - classes you will see base exception and
04:10 - we have used this class which is
04:13 - exception you can see here so to raise
04:15 - an exception you can use this exception
04:18 - class or any subclass under this
04:21 - exception so you can use automatic error
04:24 - or you can use
04:26 - or division error buffer error whatever
04:28 - error is appropriate for your exception
04:33 - you can use from this list so right now
04:37 - I have just used the exception class
04:39 - which is the base class to throw an
04:42 - exception here instead of exception I
04:44 - can also use for example exception
04:47 - called value error which is also the
04:50 - subclass of this exception class and now
04:54 - when I run the code it will show me the
04:56 - value error so this is the one way of
04:59 - throwing an exception in Python now with
05:02 - these exceptions you can also pass an
05:05 - argument inside the parentheses so you
05:08 - can write exception and then in the
05:10 - parentheses you can write the message
05:13 - whatever you want to show when this
05:15 - exception is thrown so here I can just
05:18 - write coffee is too hot and for the
05:22 - another exception I am going to just say
05:25 - coffee to cold and when I run the code
05:28 - because it's a value exception which
05:31 - comes from this statement it shows the
05:35 - value error exception and then the
05:37 - message which we want to show so we are
05:40 - just showing coffee too cold so here it
05:43 - also prints the same message which we
05:46 - have given as the first argument of this
05:49 - exception error class so you can either
05:51 - raise an exception with the base class
05:53 - exception or the subclass of the base
05:56 - class exception for example value error
05:59 - and you can also give an optional
06:01 - argument here which is the message which
06:03 - will be displayed at the time when this
06:06 - exception is thrown so this is how you
06:09 - can raise or throw an exception in
06:11 - Python I hope you have enjoyed this
06:13 - video and I will see you in the next
06:16 - video

hey guys welcome to the next video on Python tutorial for beginners in the last few videos we have seen how to handle exceptions in Python now in this video I'm going to show you how to raise an exception in Python now raising an exception is similar to threw an error or exception in the languages like Java or C++ so Python allows us to use a keyword called raise and that raised statement or keyword allows the programmer to force a specific exception to occur so let's get started and let's see this raised statement with an example so to start with I have created a class called coffee cup which have a init method which takes one argument which is the temperature and I'm just initializing the value of temperature using this init method and this coffee cup class also have one more method which is called drink coffee and inside this drink coffee method I have some conditions so if the temperature is greater than 85 then I print coffee is too hot if the temperature is less than 65 then I print coffee is too cold and if the temperature is between 65 and 85 then I print that coffee is okay and here I have created an instance of coffee cup class with an argument which is 75 to start with and I'm just calling this method drink coffee from this object so let's run the code and let's see what happens so because the 75 is neither satisfying this condition nor this condition so the answer which is printed here is coffee okay to drink now when I provide for example 101 temperature value here and when I run the code once again it will say coffee to hot if I say coffee temperature is 10 it says coffee to cold now in these two switch patience when the coffee is too hot or the coffee is too cold I can also throw an exception and show the user some kind of message so instead of printing that coffee is too hot I can use a keyword called raise and then I can use any class of exception so we can use the exception class or any subclass of exception and you can see this exception class comes in this builtin module so I'm going to just use this exception which is the base class and same I'm going to do here when the coffee is cold and I'm going to comment these two print statements and now when I run the code it throws an exception without any error so it throws an exception and after that the execution of program stops so right now temperature is 10 which satisfies this condition so this exception is thrown and that's why we see this exception so in Python we can throw an exception using this keyword race and this exception class or any subclass of this exception class now in the last video also I have shown you how to see all the subclasses which are under the exception class to see them you can just open your Python console and in the Python Python console you just need to import militants and then press Enter and now you use a method called help and inside the help method you use this keyword builtins and then press Enter which is going to give you a big list here and when you scroll up at the top you will see classes here and under the classes you will see base exception and we have used this class which is exception you can see here so to raise an exception you can use this exception class or any subclass under this exception so you can use automatic error or you can use or division error buffer error whatever error is appropriate for your exception you can use from this list so right now I have just used the exception class which is the base class to throw an exception here instead of exception I can also use for example exception called value error which is also the subclass of this exception class and now when I run the code it will show me the value error so this is the one way of throwing an exception in Python now with these exceptions you can also pass an argument inside the parentheses so you can write exception and then in the parentheses you can write the message whatever you want to show when this exception is thrown so here I can just write coffee is too hot and for the another exception I am going to just say coffee to cold and when I run the code because it's a value exception which comes from this statement it shows the value error exception and then the message which we want to show so we are just showing coffee too cold so here it also prints the same message which we have given as the first argument of this exception error class so you can either raise an exception with the base class exception or the subclass of the base class exception for example value error and you can also give an optional argument here which is the message which will be displayed at the time when this exception is thrown so this is how you can raise or throw an exception in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
