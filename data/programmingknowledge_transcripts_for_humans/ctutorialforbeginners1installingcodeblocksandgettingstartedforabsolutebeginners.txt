00:00 - hello guys from this video I'm starting
00:02 - a new video series on C++ for beginners
00:08 - so why do we care about learning
00:10 - C++ C++ is the most popular language of
00:16 - Modern Times And by using C++ you can
00:20 - develop modern uh games Modern uh
00:25 - programs like if you want to uh program
00:29 - a microcontroller or microprocessor you
00:31 - can use C++
00:34 - for programming those microcontroller or
00:37 - microprocessor because C++ is a superet
00:42 - of C so it's more uh modular more
00:49 - objectoriented and more easier to
00:52 - understand and Implement then
00:55 - C so for
00:58 - example if you see see digital watches
01:01 - or digital thermometer or digital
01:05 - anything you can use C++ to program
01:10 - those devices or even modern robots also
01:15 - you can program using
01:18 - C++ now for developing
01:22 - C++ we need to
01:26 - use something on which we can run and
01:30 - compile our C++ program so uh these
01:35 - thing or this software on which we can
01:39 - write and compile our program are called
01:43 - IDE and what are idees ID are the full
01:47 - form of IDE is integrated development
01:51 - environment and it help us to um write
01:55 - and compile our program so let's
02:00 - download a free IDE uh for compiling
02:06 - C++ and just open first of all your
02:11 - favorite browser and in the search just
02:14 - write code blocks and search for this
02:18 - and the first link here you will find is
02:21 - www.code bls.org just click this link
02:26 - and why I'm choosing code blogs because
02:29 - code clo blocks is a CL cross plateform
02:33 - and free IDE for developing C C++ and
02:38 - even
02:39 - portr so that means you can use or you
02:45 - can use this IDE on Windows as well as
02:49 - Linux operating system like Ubuntu or
02:52 - Linux Mint or even Mac OS you can use
02:56 - this IDE so most of the uh operating
03:00 - system uh supports this IDE right and
03:06 - now how do we download and install this
03:09 - ID just go to this download
03:14 - tab and in
03:17 - here there are three options for you
03:20 - download the binary release download the
03:23 - source code and retrieve Source codes
03:25 - from SPN that is sub
03:28 - version the link we are interested in is
03:32 - this link download the binary release
03:35 - just click this
03:36 - link and in here there
03:40 - are different downloadable
03:46 - options like Linux or Mac OS but the one
03:52 - we are interested in is for Windows and
03:55 - here also there are three options to
03:58 - download
04:00 - this code blocks and the option we are
04:03 - interested in is this middle option
04:07 - which is code blocks minus the version
04:10 - the latest version is 13.12 right now
04:14 - and Min GW minus setup so just download
04:20 - this option with Min
04:22 - GW so
04:24 - just select this option and just click
04:28 - this Source Forge do net and it will
04:32 - download code blocks on
04:35 - your computer and once this code blocks
04:40 - IDE is downloaded you just save it and
04:46 - run this installer I have already
04:48 - downloaded the code blocks on my system
04:50 - it's not really a rocket signs you just
04:54 - need to click some next buttons and code
04:57 - blocks will be installed on your
05:01 - system okay so once code blocks is
05:04 - installed in on your system just go to
05:08 - this start button
05:09 - and just open this code
05:12 - blocks from this start
05:16 - menu and this will open code blocks Here
05:22 - and Now for creating a new project in
05:25 - code blocks you can either click this
05:29 - option here or you can go to this file
05:34 - menu here and go to new and new project
05:39 - okay and there are different option we
05:42 - can develop using Code blocks like you
05:46 - can program arm devices arm devices that
05:49 - means
05:50 - microprocessors or some other uh kind of
05:55 - programs you can make with code blocks
05:59 - but the one we are interested in is this
06:02 - console
06:03 - application okay so just click this and
06:08 - click
06:09 - go and just click
06:13 - next and here there are two options C
06:16 - and C++ so obviously we will choose C++
06:20 - because this is a C++ tutorial and click
06:24 - next and in here you need to write the
06:28 - name of your project
06:30 - okay so just give any name to your
06:36 - project for
06:39 - example
06:43 - test
06:47 - my
06:49 - prog or you can say
06:55 - my
06:57 - first prog of program okay
07:02 - and in here where it says folder to
07:06 - create project in you need to choose one
07:10 - folder in which you want to save your
07:14 - program so for the first time when
07:18 - you start this code block this option
07:23 - will be empty and you need to give some
07:28 - path here to a folder so that your C++
07:35 - program can be saved in that specified
07:39 - path so
07:41 - just give some path here in or give the
07:45 - path of the folder in which you want to
07:48 - save your project okay and this will be
07:52 - generated automatically and click
07:55 - next and the compile we are using is g++
08:01 - or gnu GCC compiler there are other
08:04 - compiler available also but by default
08:07 - our compiler is gnu GCC compiler and
08:11 - press
08:12 - finish and you can see here our new
08:16 - project is created here called my first
08:20 - prog and in here there is a folder
08:23 - called source and when you click this
08:26 - plus button here this is small plus
08:29 - button you will be able to see this
08:32 - main.cpp file and when you click this
08:36 - main.cpp just double click
08:40 - it and it will open this main.
08:45 - CPP in here in your
08:47 - workspace and what is this
08:51 - main.cpp is this is a file in which our
08:56 - program will be started okay or will be
09:00 - written so by default code blogs has
09:03 - generated a very simple program for us
09:08 - which I'm going to explain in the next
09:11 - video but what I'm going to show you is
09:15 - how you can compile this program so once
09:21 - you have written your program in your
09:25 - IDE you need to compile your program
09:30 - that means you need to
09:33 - verify uh that if you have a committed
09:37 - any mistakes in your program while
09:40 - writing your program so compiler
09:44 - recognizes mistakes or suggest
09:46 - suggestion if you have uh done any
09:49 - mistakes in your uh uh program and it
09:53 - will make a binary or executable file
09:56 - for you which you can run so how you can
09:59 - compile your program just select your
10:03 - project in my case this is my first
10:06 - project right click it and just search
10:10 - for the option called build okay just
10:14 - click this option
10:16 - build and you can see
10:19 - here our program is built now and it has
10:23 - zero errors zero warnings that means our
10:27 - program is is successfully compiled now
10:32 - to run your program you can
10:35 - either press this button or you can go
10:40 - to build and press run button here okay
10:45 - and there is a build option here also
10:47 - which we have used here earlier so just
10:51 - go to build and click this run button
10:55 - and you can
10:57 - see this ex this terminal has started
11:01 - and it has printed hello world because
11:04 - it's our first program and this is to
11:07 - print hello world so you can see here
11:10 - hello world and this other thing is uh a
11:15 - default so this you don't really care
11:19 - about but the message we wanted to show
11:22 - is hello world so in this way you can
11:27 - download and install all code blocks IDE
11:31 - on your Windows operating system in the
11:34 - next video I will also show you how you
11:37 - can download and install code blocks on
11:40 - your Linux operating system like Ubuntu
11:43 - so if you
11:45 - want uh to use Windows you can skip that
11:49 - video and uh you can directly jump to
11:54 - the first uh video where I will show you
11:57 - how this program works okay so that's it
12:01 - for now I hope you have learned
12:04 - something new this time please rate
12:06 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
