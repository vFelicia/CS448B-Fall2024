00:07 - so because it's in my debug folder I
00:10 - don't need to give this long path but if
00:13 - you are your database is outside your
00:17 - debug folder
00:20 - or is a away from your exe file folder
00:25 - then you can give the path also so right
00:29 - data source is equal to database. DB
00:32 - which is my database
00:34 - name then semicolon version is equal to
00:38 - three
00:40 - semicolon and double code so write this
00:42 - line at the
00:44 - top now in this button click event for
00:47 - login page what I will do is I will
00:51 - create a connection with my escolite
00:56 - database so
00:58 - write the
01:01 - this line
01:06 - here so first declare this escolite
01:10 - connection write escolite
01:13 - connection and give it a variable name
01:16 - escolite Con in my case is equal to new
01:18 - escolite connection and here in this
01:24 - argument of this escolite connection you
01:26 - will pass this connection string
01:29 - variable here so this just copy this and
01:32 - paste it here and then just copy this
01:36 - escolite connection variable here and
01:39 - write do
01:41 - open now here we can also provide this
01:45 - try catch block so if this data base
01:51 - faces the some exception then it will
01:53 - catch the
01:57 - exception catch
02:06 - and just give
02:09 - this and here you can
02:17 - write exception
02:20 - ex and in here you can give the message
02:28 - box dot
02:31 - show and in the bracket just copy this
02:36 - ex and
02:38 - Dot
02:40 - message okay now in this try catch block
02:45 - after this
02:48 - escolite con.
02:50 - open what we need to do is we need to
02:53 - pass our query
02:58 - so so here we will write this
03:03 - line so write string and give it a
03:07 - variable name because
03:08 - it's uh it is my query string so I will
03:12 - write query is equal to then I will pass
03:15 - my query so I will write select star
03:19 - from employee info which is my table
03:23 - name of my database so this is the table
03:27 - and this is called employee info that's
03:29 - I have written here so select star from
03:32 - employee info
03:34 - where username so my column here is
03:40 - called
03:41 - username so I have written where
03:44 - username is equal to then write this
03:49 - single quote and inside double
03:52 - quote and inside this give this plus
03:56 - sign and write this Dot
04:00 - textor username do text this is my
04:04 - textbox name so this text box name is
04:08 - textor username so that's what I have
04:11 - written here this dot text uncore
04:15 - username do
04:17 - text okay and then after this end of
04:20 - this single code write and password is
04:22 - equal
04:24 - to single code double code plus and then
04:28 - I will write this do
04:31 - textor password.txt this is my text box
04:35 - name of for the
04:37 - password right so I have written this
04:41 - query then in the next
04:44 - line I will C create the command for
04:47 - this query so I will write this line
04:49 - write escolite command and give it a
04:53 - variable name create command is equal to
04:56 - new escolite command and in the argument
05:00 - of this escolite command just pass this
05:03 - query variable as a first argument
05:07 - and write this escolite Con variable as
05:11 - a second argument so write this
05:15 - line now in the third
05:20 - line I will write
05:23 - here these two lines so I will execute
05:27 - this query now so write
05:30 - create
05:32 - command which is my this esite command
05:36 - variable dot execute non-query and
05:40 - bracket and bracket close and declare a
05:42 - new variable called escal Data reader
05:45 - and give it a variable name called Dr
05:48 - for data reader is equal to create
05:50 - command do execute reader and bracket
05:55 - and bracket close in the next line for
05:59 - log l in page I'm creating a
06:02 - integer
06:04 - called count is equal to
06:07 - 0er and then I will create a while loop
06:12 - so I will write
06:13 - V bracket and bracket close from here
06:19 - and in this V loop I will copy this Dr
06:23 - variable from here and then I will write
06:28 - Dot
06:31 - read and here close these
06:36 - brackets and now in this I what I will
06:40 - do is I will copy this count int
06:43 - variable and I will do Plus+ and bracket
06:48 - closed
06:50 - okay now after this y Loop what I will
06:55 - do is I will create a condition so what
07:00 - condition I'm going to create is write
07:05 - if and give
07:08 - it
07:10 - just close
07:13 - this first if condition and first of all
07:19 - write if
07:22 - count
07:28 - is equal to
07:31 - one then I will pass some
07:35 - message which shows like this in this if
07:39 - condition I have written message box do
07:41 - show username and password is correct
07:45 - so what I'm doing is I'm writing or
07:49 - entering the username and password and
07:51 - I'm passing this query to query the
07:55 - database and it goes to the y Loop and
08:01 - it searches for the username and
08:04 - password
08:07 - and while in the while loop it
08:11 - increases if it's find it finds the
08:13 - username and password and if it finds
08:17 - the username and password once then your
08:20 - username and password is
08:22 - correct and I will just copy this
08:25 - condition two time more so 1 and two and
08:31 - if
08:32 - this count is greater than one
08:37 - then you will
08:41 - write duplicate username and
08:47 - password and you can also write
08:50 - try again right and if this count is
08:58 - smaller than
08:59 - one then you can write username and
09:03 - password
09:04 - is not correct
09:09 - okay so that is your code for the login
09:13 - page okay so now we are going to run the
09:19 - code
09:20 - now so run this code and first of all we
09:25 - will just see the table what we have in
09:28 - the username and pass password so I have
09:30 - three employees right
09:32 - now and first employee username and
09:36 - password is one and one second employee
09:39 - username and password and username is
09:41 - two and two and in the third employee my
09:45 - username and password is one and one
09:47 - again so this is a duplicate username
09:50 - and password which I
09:52 - created uh for a reason to show this
09:55 - demonstration so now when I run the
09:58 - program and it's running and I write
10:01 - here one and one username and password
10:05 - and I click
10:08 - here
10:09 - login it shows me duplicate username and
10:12 - password why because this username and
10:16 - password is present two times and two
10:20 - employees cannot have the same username
10:22 - and password that's why I have given
10:25 - this condition now when I write here two
10:28 - and to employee ID then it says me
10:33 - username and password is correct because
10:35 - it's present only once and username and
10:39 - password is correct and when I give you
10:43 - three and some random value and I click
10:47 - it says me username and password is not
10:50 - correct okay so now your login page is
10:57 - basically working
10:59 - right you just need to change this
11:04 - username content if you want so it will
11:07 - look good and here also
11:11 - password just change the content so now
11:14 - it's looking
11:17 - better okay so in this way you can
11:20 - create a login page for your WPF cop
11:24 - application using your escal database I
11:28 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

Cleaned transcript:

so because it's in my debug folder I don't need to give this long path but if you are your database is outside your debug folder or is a away from your exe file folder then you can give the path also so right data source is equal to database. DB which is my database name then semicolon version is equal to three semicolon and double code so write this line at the top now in this button click event for login page what I will do is I will create a connection with my escolite database so write the this line here so first declare this escolite connection write escolite connection and give it a variable name escolite Con in my case is equal to new escolite connection and here in this argument of this escolite connection you will pass this connection string variable here so this just copy this and paste it here and then just copy this escolite connection variable here and write do open now here we can also provide this try catch block so if this data base faces the some exception then it will catch the exception catch and just give this and here you can write exception ex and in here you can give the message box dot show and in the bracket just copy this ex and Dot message okay now in this try catch block after this escolite con. open what we need to do is we need to pass our query so so here we will write this line so write string and give it a variable name because it's uh it is my query string so I will write query is equal to then I will pass my query so I will write select star from employee info which is my table name of my database so this is the table and this is called employee info that's I have written here so select star from employee info where username so my column here is called username so I have written where username is equal to then write this single quote and inside double quote and inside this give this plus sign and write this Dot textor username do text this is my textbox name so this text box name is textor username so that's what I have written here this dot text uncore username do text okay and then after this end of this single code write and password is equal to single code double code plus and then I will write this do textor password.txt this is my text box name of for the password right so I have written this query then in the next line I will C create the command for this query so I will write this line write escolite command and give it a variable name create command is equal to new escolite command and in the argument of this escolite command just pass this query variable as a first argument and write this escolite Con variable as a second argument so write this line now in the third line I will write here these two lines so I will execute this query now so write create command which is my this esite command variable dot execute nonquery and bracket and bracket close and declare a new variable called escal Data reader and give it a variable name called Dr for data reader is equal to create command do execute reader and bracket and bracket close in the next line for log l in page I'm creating a integer called count is equal to 0er and then I will create a while loop so I will write V bracket and bracket close from here and in this V loop I will copy this Dr variable from here and then I will write Dot read and here close these brackets and now in this I what I will do is I will copy this count int variable and I will do Plus+ and bracket closed okay now after this y Loop what I will do is I will create a condition so what condition I'm going to create is write if and give it just close this first if condition and first of all write if count is equal to one then I will pass some message which shows like this in this if condition I have written message box do show username and password is correct so what I'm doing is I'm writing or entering the username and password and I'm passing this query to query the database and it goes to the y Loop and it searches for the username and password and while in the while loop it increases if it's find it finds the username and password and if it finds the username and password once then your username and password is correct and I will just copy this condition two time more so 1 and two and if this count is greater than one then you will write duplicate username and password and you can also write try again right and if this count is smaller than one then you can write username and password is not correct okay so that is your code for the login page okay so now we are going to run the code now so run this code and first of all we will just see the table what we have in the username and pass password so I have three employees right now and first employee username and password is one and one second employee username and password and username is two and two and in the third employee my username and password is one and one again so this is a duplicate username and password which I created uh for a reason to show this demonstration so now when I run the program and it's running and I write here one and one username and password and I click here login it shows me duplicate username and password why because this username and password is present two times and two employees cannot have the same username and password that's why I have given this condition now when I write here two and to employee ID then it says me username and password is correct because it's present only once and username and password is correct and when I give you three and some random value and I click it says me username and password is not correct okay so now your login page is basically working right you just need to change this username content if you want so it will look good and here also password just change the content so now it's looking better okay so in this way you can create a login page for your WPF cop application using your escal database I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
