05:08 - and then this will be the location of
05:10 - that environment and then you can also
05:13 - select your interpreter right so as i
05:16 - have mentioned you need to have
05:18 - python installed on your windows
05:20 - operating system
05:21 - in order to use pycharm to develop your
05:24 - python project so you can see i have
05:27 - pre-installed this python that's why
05:30 - pycharm has detected the python
05:33 - executable on my windows 11 operating
05:36 - system and it's showing me this option
05:39 - if you don't have python then you will
05:42 - not see this option so i will recommend
05:44 - you to install python first and then
05:47 - install pycharm
05:49 - i'm going to just click on create which
05:51 - is going to create a new project for me
05:53 - and when pycharm ide starts it always
05:56 - gives you these tips so you can read
05:58 - them and then click on close and you can
06:01 - see my project has been created
06:04 - and this project have one file right now
06:08 - which is called main dot py file and you
06:10 - can see pycharm has also created a
06:13 - sample
06:14 - python
06:15 - program for me inside this main dot py
06:18 - file right so in order to run this
06:20 - main.py file i can just right click here
06:24 - and then click on run file in python
06:27 - console
06:28 - which is going to run this python file
06:31 - in the python console
06:34 - so you can see
06:35 - it has opened the python console and the
06:37 - output is printed here so basically we
06:41 - were printing high pi charm here which
06:44 - is printed
06:45 - here okay
06:47 - so this is basically a
06:50 - python function and we are calling the
06:52 - python function inside the main method
06:56 - so this is like calling a main method in
06:59 - other languages like java or c plus plus
07:03 - also from the next time you can see uh
07:06 - this run main button so when you press
07:09 - this button it's going to run your
07:10 - python file or you can click on the
07:13 - debug
07:14 - button so you can uh
07:16 - just create a breakpoint here and then
07:19 - run the debug button and it's going to
07:22 - uh you know run your python file in the
07:25 - debug mode
07:27 - so this is how you can download and
07:29 - install and use pycharm on your windows
07:32 - 11 operating system
07:33 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
07:35 - will see you in the next video
