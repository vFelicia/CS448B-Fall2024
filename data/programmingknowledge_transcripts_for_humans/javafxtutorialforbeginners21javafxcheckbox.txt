00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will learn about using
00:06 - checkboxes in Java FX now first of all
00:10 - what are check boxes and why do we use
00:14 - it generally check boxes are used
00:16 - whenever you want to choose one or more
00:21 - items in a list right so for example you
00:26 - want to choose from your favorite sports
00:29 - what are your favorite sports they can
00:32 - be number of sports which can be
00:35 - favorite sports right or for example you
00:39 - want to choose your favorite animal so
00:42 - it's not necessary that you have to
00:44 - choose one animal there can be multiple
00:47 - animal or there can be one animal so in
00:51 - these situations you can use checkboxes
00:54 - right now let's get started and see how
00:58 - we can use them so I have created this
01:00 - sample project and I named it as check
01:03 - box and as always I have this
01:06 - application package in which I have this
01:09 - main dot Java in which I have added this
01:11 - line of code to add main dot effects ml
01:15 - and my main dot F XML right now is empty
01:18 - and I have this main controller which is
01:22 - also empty right now so first of all
01:25 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:27 - open my main dot F XML file using the
01:31 - scene builder and in here I have this
01:35 - anchor pane now I'm going to go to
01:37 - controls and I'm going to take some
01:41 - check boxes from here so I'm going to
01:43 - take four check boxes one two three and
01:49 - four and first of all I'm going to go to
01:53 - the property of these check boxes and
01:55 - I'm going to change the name of these
01:58 - check boxes so for example we want to
02:00 - allow the user to choose for his
02:04 - favorite animals right so first check
02:06 - box I will change the name of this check
02:09 - box as for example dog
02:13 - the second checkbox i am going to name
02:15 - it as cat and for the third checkbox it
02:20 - will be for example cow and the fourth
02:25 - checkbox will be for example rat okay
02:29 - and next what I'm going to do here is
02:32 - I'm going to give the ID to all these
02:36 - check boxes okay so I'm going to go to
02:38 - the code and I will give the ID so for
02:41 - the first check box I will give the ID
02:44 - for example CB one okay and for the
02:48 - second check box I'm going to give the
02:50 - ID CB 2 and for the third check box I'm
02:54 - going to give the ID c b3 and the 4th
02:58 - check box I'm going to give the ID CB
03:02 - for for checkbox for okay so I have all
03:06 - these IDs now I need to connect my F XML
03:11 - file to the controller so I will go to
03:13 - the controller here and I will choose
03:15 - this application dot main controller and
03:18 - then I'm going to create a function
03:21 - inside my main controller dot Java class
03:25 - but first of all I am going to take some
03:28 - labels so that I can print which you
03:33 - know items I have selected
03:35 - okay so let's print here the number of
03:40 - items I have selected and then let's
03:44 - take one more label to print which items
03:48 - I have selected okay so I am going to
03:52 - make it a little bit bigger like this
03:54 - okay
03:55 - and I'm going to change the label of
03:58 - these two labels and I'm going to make
04:04 - them empty for now and the first label
04:07 - name I'm going to name it as label list
04:12 - for example okay so LBL list which will
04:16 - give us the list of the items selected
04:21 - okay the second label I am going to name
04:24 - it as
04:25 - a label count for example because it's
04:29 - going to give us the number of items we
04:32 - have selected okay so once everything is
04:35 - done just save your code and then
04:37 - refresh your project once again and now
04:42 - just go to your main controller dot Java
04:46 - class and in here we are going to
04:49 - declare these check boxes and labels so
04:53 - we have four check boxes and two labels
04:57 - right so I'm going to declare these
04:59 - check boxes and labels so I have
05:01 - declared these four check box variables
05:05 - and to label variables and keep in mind
05:09 - these name should be equal to the FX ID
05:12 - we have provided for the labels and the
05:16 - check boxes right so for the check boxes
05:18 - we have the labels C B 1 C B to C B 3
05:21 - and C V 4 for the label we have label
05:24 - count and label list so same name I have
05:27 - given here and I'm going to import the
05:30 - check box and I'm going to import the
05:33 - JavaFX label here okay and now what I'm
05:38 - going to do is I'm going to create a
05:39 - public void method to listen for these a
05:44 - check box event ok so just add a public
05:49 - void method here and it's going to
05:53 - return nothing so it's void and the name
05:56 - of this method I'm going to say it's
05:59 - check event ok and it's going to take
06:03 - one argument which is action event and
06:06 - give the name to the argument which is
06:10 - event for example and now inside your
06:13 - method what we are going to do is we are
06:15 - going to first define a variable which
06:19 - is count which is going to give us the
06:21 - number of items selected and second
06:24 - variable I am going to declare a string
06:28 - here okay
06:29 - and this string is going to display our
06:32 - message so let's say it's message here
06:36 - and I'm going to initialize it
06:39 - the empty string okay now what I'm going
06:43 - to do is I'm going to take one of my
06:45 - check box object which is CB one and I
06:49 - will create a if statement here and take
06:52 - my CB one object and I'm going to call a
06:55 - method called is selected here okay and
07:00 - this method returns the boolean value if
07:03 - your checkbox is selected it's going to
07:06 - give us true otherwise it's going to
07:08 - give us false right so if the checkbox
07:13 - one is selected we will increment the
07:17 - counter by one so we know that one item
07:20 - is selected and then we are going to add
07:25 - to this message string the name of the
07:29 - checkbox so just concatenate the name of
07:33 - the checkbox so just write plus equals
07:36 - and then CB one which is our checkbox
07:40 - object name dot get text okay so it's
07:45 - going to return you the text and for
07:48 - example we want to you know show each
07:51 - item in different line so you can add
07:54 - plus and then inside these double quotes
07:57 - you can give this backslash and then and
08:01 - to change the line write the same thing
08:04 - I'm going to do four other four check
08:07 - boxes so I'm going to copy this if
08:10 - condition and paste it three more times
08:13 - and this will be our CB 2 and in here
08:18 - also CB 2 and this is CB 3 and in here
08:22 - also CB 3 and the CB 4 ok now the last
08:26 - thing what we want to do is we want to
08:29 - set to our labels the value right so we
08:33 - will take our label count variable from
08:37 - here and in here we will just set the
08:41 - count value to this label so just write
08:43 - label count dot set text and then we can
08:49 - to add a message first for example items
08:53 - selected and then the semicolon and then
08:56 - give your counter value or count value
09:00 - here okay in the second label which we
09:05 - have we have this label list and inside
09:09 - this label we are going to set the text
09:13 - once again set text and in here we are
09:16 - going to set the message okay so that's
09:20 - it this is our code now one thing which
09:23 - is remaining here is we want to add this
09:26 - method in our F XML file so just copy
09:29 - your method from here go to your F XML
09:32 - file and then to each of your check box
09:37 - go to each check box and go to on action
09:41 - here and then choose your method from
09:45 - here okay
09:46 - so for each check box you need to do
09:48 - this okay so one two three and four
09:54 - check boxes okay and now save your code
09:57 - and then refresh your project once again
10:01 - and then run your code so our app is
10:07 - running now so let's select one check
10:10 - box and it prints the name or text on
10:14 - the check box and it also prints the
10:17 - number of check box selected so right
10:19 - now only one check box is selected so
10:21 - it's prep it prints one right let's
10:24 - select the second check box and now you
10:28 - can see both the names of the check box
10:31 - and number of items selected okay
10:34 - let's select third and in here you see
10:38 - three and in here you see three you know
10:41 - names of the items right and the fourth
10:45 - right now uncheck these and you will see
10:49 - all these items are printed here and
10:53 - number of items is printed here also so
10:58 - in this way you can use checkboxes in
11:00 - JavaFX I hope you have enjoyed this way
11:03 - do please rate comment subscribe and bye
11:05 - for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on Java fix tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about using checkboxes in Java FX now first of all what are check boxes and why do we use it generally check boxes are used whenever you want to choose one or more items in a list right so for example you want to choose from your favorite sports what are your favorite sports they can be number of sports which can be favorite sports right or for example you want to choose your favorite animal so it's not necessary that you have to choose one animal there can be multiple animal or there can be one animal so in these situations you can use checkboxes right now let's get started and see how we can use them so I have created this sample project and I named it as check box and as always I have this application package in which I have this main dot Java in which I have added this line of code to add main dot effects ml and my main dot F XML right now is empty and I have this main controller which is also empty right now so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my main dot F XML file using the scene builder and in here I have this anchor pane now I'm going to go to controls and I'm going to take some check boxes from here so I'm going to take four check boxes one two three and four and first of all I'm going to go to the property of these check boxes and I'm going to change the name of these check boxes so for example we want to allow the user to choose for his favorite animals right so first check box I will change the name of this check box as for example dog the second checkbox i am going to name it as cat and for the third checkbox it will be for example cow and the fourth checkbox will be for example rat okay and next what I'm going to do here is I'm going to give the ID to all these check boxes okay so I'm going to go to the code and I will give the ID so for the first check box I will give the ID for example CB one okay and for the second check box I'm going to give the ID CB 2 and for the third check box I'm going to give the ID c b3 and the 4th check box I'm going to give the ID CB for for checkbox for okay so I have all these IDs now I need to connect my F XML file to the controller so I will go to the controller here and I will choose this application dot main controller and then I'm going to create a function inside my main controller dot Java class but first of all I am going to take some labels so that I can print which you know items I have selected okay so let's print here the number of items I have selected and then let's take one more label to print which items I have selected okay so I am going to make it a little bit bigger like this okay and I'm going to change the label of these two labels and I'm going to make them empty for now and the first label name I'm going to name it as label list for example okay so LBL list which will give us the list of the items selected okay the second label I am going to name it as a label count for example because it's going to give us the number of items we have selected okay so once everything is done just save your code and then refresh your project once again and now just go to your main controller dot Java class and in here we are going to declare these check boxes and labels so we have four check boxes and two labels right so I'm going to declare these check boxes and labels so I have declared these four check box variables and to label variables and keep in mind these name should be equal to the FX ID we have provided for the labels and the check boxes right so for the check boxes we have the labels C B 1 C B to C B 3 and C V 4 for the label we have label count and label list so same name I have given here and I'm going to import the check box and I'm going to import the JavaFX label here okay and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a public void method to listen for these a check box event ok so just add a public void method here and it's going to return nothing so it's void and the name of this method I'm going to say it's check event ok and it's going to take one argument which is action event and give the name to the argument which is event for example and now inside your method what we are going to do is we are going to first define a variable which is count which is going to give us the number of items selected and second variable I am going to declare a string here okay and this string is going to display our message so let's say it's message here and I'm going to initialize it the empty string okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take one of my check box object which is CB one and I will create a if statement here and take my CB one object and I'm going to call a method called is selected here okay and this method returns the boolean value if your checkbox is selected it's going to give us true otherwise it's going to give us false right so if the checkbox one is selected we will increment the counter by one so we know that one item is selected and then we are going to add to this message string the name of the checkbox so just concatenate the name of the checkbox so just write plus equals and then CB one which is our checkbox object name dot get text okay so it's going to return you the text and for example we want to you know show each item in different line so you can add plus and then inside these double quotes you can give this backslash and then and to change the line write the same thing I'm going to do four other four check boxes so I'm going to copy this if condition and paste it three more times and this will be our CB 2 and in here also CB 2 and this is CB 3 and in here also CB 3 and the CB 4 ok now the last thing what we want to do is we want to set to our labels the value right so we will take our label count variable from here and in here we will just set the count value to this label so just write label count dot set text and then we can to add a message first for example items selected and then the semicolon and then give your counter value or count value here okay in the second label which we have we have this label list and inside this label we are going to set the text once again set text and in here we are going to set the message okay so that's it this is our code now one thing which is remaining here is we want to add this method in our F XML file so just copy your method from here go to your F XML file and then to each of your check box go to each check box and go to on action here and then choose your method from here okay so for each check box you need to do this okay so one two three and four check boxes okay and now save your code and then refresh your project once again and then run your code so our app is running now so let's select one check box and it prints the name or text on the check box and it also prints the number of check box selected so right now only one check box is selected so it's prep it prints one right let's select the second check box and now you can see both the names of the check box and number of items selected okay let's select third and in here you see three and in here you see three you know names of the items right and the fourth right now uncheck these and you will see all these items are printed here and number of items is printed here also so in this way you can use checkboxes in JavaFX I hope you have enjoyed this way do please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
