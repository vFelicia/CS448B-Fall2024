00:00 - hey guys in this video I am going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install anaconda which is a Python
00:06 - distribution on your urban to operating
00:09 - system so first of all what is anaconda
00:12 - so anaconda is a free and open source
00:15 - distribution of r and python programming
00:18 - languages for data science and machine
00:21 - learning related applications so let's
00:24 - see how we can install anaconda so first
00:27 - of all open your favorite browser and
00:29 - search for anaconda comm and the first
00:32 - language will obviously appear here will
00:34 - be from anaconda comm so just go to this
00:38 - website which is anaconda comm and on
00:41 - the right hand top you will be able to
00:43 - see this button which says download in
00:45 - green so just click on this button and
00:48 - then just scroll down and you will be
00:51 - able to see the Linux is already
00:53 - selected here and the latest version of
00:57 - anaconda at the time of making this
00:59 - video is anaconda 5.2 now you will also
01:03 - see here two version of Python which is
01:06 - available with this anaconda
01:08 - installation one is Python 2.7 other is
01:12 - Python 3.6 so what we are going to do is
01:16 - we are going to install the 3.6 version
01:19 - of python so i'm going to just click on
01:21 - this download button which is going to
01:23 - start that download of this dot SH file
01:27 - so I'm going to just save it on my
01:29 - computer and I'm going to close this
01:33 - window so now this anaconda dot SH file
01:37 - is downloaded on my Ubuntu operating
01:39 - system so let's see how we can install
01:41 - anaconda using this dot SH file so on
01:45 - this download page where you have
01:47 - downloaded anaconda dot s such file when
01:51 - you scroll down you will be able to see
01:53 - these two links one is how to get python
01:56 - 3.5 and other python versions and other
01:59 - is how to install anaconda so we will
02:01 - click on this link which says how to
02:03 - install anaconda and let's see what is
02:06 - the official document saying so first of
02:10 - all we need to download this dot SH file
02:14 - so that we have already done second step
02:16 - is we need to just verify the checksum
02:20 - we are going to skip this step and in
02:22 - the third step we need to run the dot s
02:26 - H file using this command okay so I'm
02:29 - going to just copy this command from
02:31 - here and then I'm going to open the
02:34 - terminal
02:34 - you can open the terminal either by
02:36 - pressing ctrl alt T or by going to this
02:42 - show applications icon and then here
02:46 - searching for terminal and then open the
02:49 - terminal from here okay so once the
02:51 - terminal is open I'm going to just
02:54 - minimize the browser first of all and
02:56 - once the terminal is open I can either
02:59 - give this command which is bash and then
03:03 - because our dot sh file is downloaded
03:06 - inside this downloads folder so this
03:10 - command is enough to run the installer
03:12 - ok so I'm going to just press ENTER here
03:15 - and you can see the installation has
03:18 - been started and here we just need to
03:21 - press ENTER once again to continue so
03:23 - I'm going to press ENTER and first of
03:25 - all you need to read this license terms
03:28 - and conditions and if you agree with the
03:31 - license terms and conditions you need to
03:34 - type yes here and then press ENTER now
03:37 - in the next step you will be asked to
03:38 - provide the default location where you
03:41 - want to install anaconda so the default
03:44 - location is this one if you want to
03:47 - change it or if you have the good reason
03:49 - to change this location you can change
03:52 - it but for now I'm going to leave it as
03:54 - default so I'm going to press ENTER and
03:57 - then you will see the installation of
03:59 - the packages will start one by one it
04:03 - will start all the packages related to
04:06 - anaconda so I will wait for the
04:08 - installation to complete so now the
04:09 - installation of anaconda is almost
04:12 - completed and at last it'll ask you two
04:16 - questions first question is do you wish
04:18 - the Installer to prepend the anaconda
04:21 - install location to the path and here
04:24 - you must ideally type yes by mistake
04:28 - pressed extra Enter key here so this
04:31 - step in my case is skipped but if you
04:35 - see this question you may want to type
04:37 - yes here which will append this export
04:41 - to your batch RC and now because I
04:45 - haven't typed yes here I need to add
04:48 - this part manually to the bash RC file
04:52 - now the second question is do you wish
04:54 - to install Microsoft Visual Studio code
04:57 - so if you want to install Microsoft
04:59 - Visual Studio code you can type yes
05:01 - otherwise you can type no here so in my
05:05 - case I don't want to install Microsoft
05:06 - Visual Studio code so I type no here and
05:10 - then I come out of this terminal but
05:13 - still because I haven't typed yes here
05:15 - so I need to open this dot bash RC file
05:18 - so I'm going to just copy this path and
05:21 - then using G added so I'm going to just
05:25 - try G add it here and then the path
05:28 - which I have copied and then press enter
05:30 - here which is going to open my dot bash
05:33 - RC file and at the end of the bash RC
05:36 - file I just want to add this line of
05:40 - export so I will just copy this export
05:43 - from here and then at the end of this
05:46 - file I will just add this export at the
05:50 - end so just add this export to the end
05:52 - of bash RC if you haven't typed yes to
05:56 - this question and then just save your
05:59 - bash RC file and then close it and let's
06:01 - go to the website and let's see what it
06:03 - says at the end so we have done every
06:06 - step here and at the end it says we need
06:08 - to run source bash RC file in order to
06:12 - reload this dot bash RC file into the
06:15 - terminals so I'm going to just write
06:16 - source and then the path of the bash RC
06:19 - you can also write dot bash RC from here
06:24 - also because bash RC is present in to
06:27 - the home directory right so we can
06:29 - directly write bash RC here or we can
06:32 - give the whole path of bash RC which is
06:34 - this one and then I'm going to press
06:37 - ENTER which is going to reload this bash
06:39 - RC file into the terminal
06:41 - so now anaconda is installed on our
06:44 - urban to operating system and let's see
06:47 - the last command which we can run so the
06:50 - last command here which we can run is
06:52 - this anaconda navigator command and this
06:56 - command is going to launch the anaconda
06:59 - navigator so let's run this command let
07:02 - me clear the terminal first of all and
07:04 - let's run this command which is anaconda
07:06 - - navigator and then press enter and
07:09 - after few seconds you will be able to
07:11 - see this anaconda navigator here ok so
07:15 - you can click on ok and don't show this
07:17 - message again here and you can see
07:20 - anaconda comes with these pre-installed
07:24 - tools so for example Jupiter lab is
07:26 - pre-installed to be the notebook is
07:29 - pre-installed QT console is
07:31 - pre-installed and also Spyder IDE is
07:35 - pre-installed in addition you can
07:37 - install some of the packages from this
07:40 - anaconda navigator and these packages
07:43 - are blue with orange 3 and you can also
07:47 - install our studio and Visual Studio
07:49 - code using this anaconda navigator
07:52 - so to launch for example Jupiter
07:55 - notebook you can just click on this
07:57 - launch button and Jupiter notebook will
08:00 - be launched ok but I want to show you
08:02 - how to launch Jupiter notebook using the
08:05 - command line so for now I'm going to
08:07 - just close this anaconda navigator and
08:10 - then I'm going to just say yes which is
08:13 - going to close the anaconda navigator so
08:16 - first of all we will check whether Conda
08:18 - command is working fine on our open to
08:21 - operating system or not after installing
08:23 - anaconda so just right Conda info here
08:27 - and then press enter and you will be
08:30 - able to see this output and here you
08:33 - will be able to see the version of Conda
08:36 - which is installed on our system also
08:38 - you can run the Conda list command so
08:42 - just right Conda list and then press
08:44 - ENTER which is going to print the list
08:47 - of all the packages which are already
08:50 - there on your open to operating system
08:53 - now let me clear
08:55 - terminals once again and now in order to
08:58 - open Jupiter notebook you need to type
09:00 - Jupiter notebook here and then press
09:04 - Enter which is going to start the
09:06 - Jupiter notebook on the default browser
09:10 - so you can see Jupiter notebook has been
09:13 - started on my default browser now in
09:16 - order to create a Jupiter project I can
09:19 - go to the location where I want to save
09:21 - my project so let's say I want to save
09:23 - my project in the documents directory
09:25 - and then on the top right-hand side I
09:29 - can create a folder here so let me
09:31 - create a folder so when you click on
09:34 - create folder unnamed folder will be
09:37 - created and then you can check this
09:39 - checkbox and then rename this folder to
09:42 - whatever folder you want so for example
09:45 - I'm going to name this folder as Python
09:47 - and then click new rename and this
09:51 - folder will be created so inside this
09:53 - Python folder so when I am inside this
09:55 - Python folder I can just click on new
09:59 - once again and then click on Python 3
10:02 - and this will open this new window and
10:05 - in this new window you can run Python
10:08 - command so for example I'm going to just
10:10 - give some Python expression here 5 plus
10:13 - 5 and to execute this command you need
10:16 - to press shift enter which will execute
10:19 - this command ok once again I'm going to
10:22 - declare a variable let's say X is equal
10:25 - to 6 and when I press ENTER without the
10:28 - shift it's going to give me the next
10:30 - line and here I can write some more
10:34 - expression and when I press shift enter
10:37 - is going to execute that command ok so
10:41 - this is how you can execute commands on
10:44 - Jupiter notebook now I can also save
10:47 - this file so you can see this is now
10:49 - right now untitled so I can just click
10:52 - on this until-- till the text here and I
10:55 - can give some name here so I'm going to
10:58 - just give first underscore note-book
11:02 - and then I'm going to click on rename
11:04 - which is going to rename this file but
11:06 - still you can see unsaved changes so
11:09 - to save these changes you need to click
11:12 - on file and then click on save and
11:15 - checkpoint and once again when I open
11:18 - that terminal so I'm going to open the
11:20 - new terminal and on the terminal I will
11:22 - go to the location where I have created
11:24 - this file so CD documents and then
11:27 - python and here when I do LS you will
11:32 - see this file is created which is first
11:35 - notebook which is the name of my file
11:37 - you can see here with the extension IP Y
11:41 - and B okay so you this is how you can
11:43 - run the Jupiter notebook using the
11:46 - terminal you can also launch this
11:47 - Jupiter notebook using anaconda
11:51 - navigator also now let me close this
11:54 - browser and let me also close this
11:57 - notebook Jupiter server so in order to
12:00 - close this Jupiter notebook server you
12:02 - just need to press ctrl C here and then
12:04 - press Y and then press ENTER and you
12:08 - will come out of this server so I'm
12:11 - going to close this terminal once again
12:13 - and on the next terminal this time I
12:16 - want to start the Spyder IDE using this
12:21 - terminal so just write Spyder and then
12:24 - press ENTER and if you see this message
12:26 - which says segmentation fault or any
12:28 - other error you can first of all update
12:31 - the spider version using the Conda
12:33 - command so just write Conda update
12:37 - spider and then press ENTER which is
12:40 - going to update the version of spider on
12:43 - your bun to operating system and once
12:45 - you have updated the version of spider
12:47 - using Conda you can also run this
12:50 - command which is Conda install and then
12:53 - PI OpenGL ok and then press ENTER once
12:57 - again and now you just need to press Y
12:59 - to proceed and once this command is
13:01 - successful we are going to run this
13:03 - spider command once again in order to
13:06 - launch the spider and you can see the
13:09 - spider is now open so first of all I'm
13:12 - going to click on OK here and in order
13:14 - to run some command or run this Python
13:17 - script I can for example write something
13:20 - here so I just want to write pi
13:23 - plus five and then I can select this
13:25 - line which I have written which is five
13:28 - plus five and then press shift enter in
13:31 - order to execute this command and you
13:33 - will see here the output of this
13:35 - expression is printed here if you want
13:37 - to execute the whole file for example I
13:40 - will just write here prin and inside the
13:42 - parentheses I will just print HelloWorld
13:45 - and I will save my file and I can also
13:48 - press this green button which is used to
13:51 - run your Python file and you can see
13:53 - hello world is again printed once again
13:57 - I will just correct the spelling of
13:58 - hello here and then once again I'm going
14:01 - to run this program and you can see this
14:03 - script has been executed by this spider
14:08 - IDE and the output you will be able to
14:10 - see on the console here so this is how
14:13 - you can download and install anaconda
14:15 - with Jupiter notebook and spider IDE I
14:19 - hope you have enjoyed this video and I
14:21 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I am going to show you how you can download and install anaconda which is a Python distribution on your urban to operating system so first of all what is anaconda so anaconda is a free and open source distribution of r and python programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications so let's see how we can install anaconda so first of all open your favorite browser and search for anaconda comm and the first language will obviously appear here will be from anaconda comm so just go to this website which is anaconda comm and on the right hand top you will be able to see this button which says download in green so just click on this button and then just scroll down and you will be able to see the Linux is already selected here and the latest version of anaconda at the time of making this video is anaconda 5.2 now you will also see here two version of Python which is available with this anaconda installation one is Python 2.7 other is Python 3.6 so what we are going to do is we are going to install the 3.6 version of python so i'm going to just click on this download button which is going to start that download of this dot SH file so I'm going to just save it on my computer and I'm going to close this window so now this anaconda dot SH file is downloaded on my Ubuntu operating system so let's see how we can install anaconda using this dot SH file so on this download page where you have downloaded anaconda dot s such file when you scroll down you will be able to see these two links one is how to get python 3.5 and other python versions and other is how to install anaconda so we will click on this link which says how to install anaconda and let's see what is the official document saying so first of all we need to download this dot SH file so that we have already done second step is we need to just verify the checksum we are going to skip this step and in the third step we need to run the dot s H file using this command okay so I'm going to just copy this command from here and then I'm going to open the terminal you can open the terminal either by pressing ctrl alt T or by going to this show applications icon and then here searching for terminal and then open the terminal from here okay so once the terminal is open I'm going to just minimize the browser first of all and once the terminal is open I can either give this command which is bash and then because our dot sh file is downloaded inside this downloads folder so this command is enough to run the installer ok so I'm going to just press ENTER here and you can see the installation has been started and here we just need to press ENTER once again to continue so I'm going to press ENTER and first of all you need to read this license terms and conditions and if you agree with the license terms and conditions you need to type yes here and then press ENTER now in the next step you will be asked to provide the default location where you want to install anaconda so the default location is this one if you want to change it or if you have the good reason to change this location you can change it but for now I'm going to leave it as default so I'm going to press ENTER and then you will see the installation of the packages will start one by one it will start all the packages related to anaconda so I will wait for the installation to complete so now the installation of anaconda is almost completed and at last it'll ask you two questions first question is do you wish the Installer to prepend the anaconda install location to the path and here you must ideally type yes by mistake pressed extra Enter key here so this step in my case is skipped but if you see this question you may want to type yes here which will append this export to your batch RC and now because I haven't typed yes here I need to add this part manually to the bash RC file now the second question is do you wish to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so if you want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code you can type yes otherwise you can type no here so in my case I don't want to install Microsoft Visual Studio code so I type no here and then I come out of this terminal but still because I haven't typed yes here so I need to open this dot bash RC file so I'm going to just copy this path and then using G added so I'm going to just try G add it here and then the path which I have copied and then press enter here which is going to open my dot bash RC file and at the end of the bash RC file I just want to add this line of export so I will just copy this export from here and then at the end of this file I will just add this export at the end so just add this export to the end of bash RC if you haven't typed yes to this question and then just save your bash RC file and then close it and let's go to the website and let's see what it says at the end so we have done every step here and at the end it says we need to run source bash RC file in order to reload this dot bash RC file into the terminals so I'm going to just write source and then the path of the bash RC you can also write dot bash RC from here also because bash RC is present in to the home directory right so we can directly write bash RC here or we can give the whole path of bash RC which is this one and then I'm going to press ENTER which is going to reload this bash RC file into the terminal so now anaconda is installed on our urban to operating system and let's see the last command which we can run so the last command here which we can run is this anaconda navigator command and this command is going to launch the anaconda navigator so let's run this command let me clear the terminal first of all and let's run this command which is anaconda navigator and then press enter and after few seconds you will be able to see this anaconda navigator here ok so you can click on ok and don't show this message again here and you can see anaconda comes with these preinstalled tools so for example Jupiter lab is preinstalled to be the notebook is preinstalled QT console is preinstalled and also Spyder IDE is preinstalled in addition you can install some of the packages from this anaconda navigator and these packages are blue with orange 3 and you can also install our studio and Visual Studio code using this anaconda navigator so to launch for example Jupiter notebook you can just click on this launch button and Jupiter notebook will be launched ok but I want to show you how to launch Jupiter notebook using the command line so for now I'm going to just close this anaconda navigator and then I'm going to just say yes which is going to close the anaconda navigator so first of all we will check whether Conda command is working fine on our open to operating system or not after installing anaconda so just right Conda info here and then press enter and you will be able to see this output and here you will be able to see the version of Conda which is installed on our system also you can run the Conda list command so just right Conda list and then press ENTER which is going to print the list of all the packages which are already there on your open to operating system now let me clear terminals once again and now in order to open Jupiter notebook you need to type Jupiter notebook here and then press Enter which is going to start the Jupiter notebook on the default browser so you can see Jupiter notebook has been started on my default browser now in order to create a Jupiter project I can go to the location where I want to save my project so let's say I want to save my project in the documents directory and then on the top righthand side I can create a folder here so let me create a folder so when you click on create folder unnamed folder will be created and then you can check this checkbox and then rename this folder to whatever folder you want so for example I'm going to name this folder as Python and then click new rename and this folder will be created so inside this Python folder so when I am inside this Python folder I can just click on new once again and then click on Python 3 and this will open this new window and in this new window you can run Python command so for example I'm going to just give some Python expression here 5 plus 5 and to execute this command you need to press shift enter which will execute this command ok once again I'm going to declare a variable let's say X is equal to 6 and when I press ENTER without the shift it's going to give me the next line and here I can write some more expression and when I press shift enter is going to execute that command ok so this is how you can execute commands on Jupiter notebook now I can also save this file so you can see this is now right now untitled so I can just click on this until till the text here and I can give some name here so I'm going to just give first underscore notebook and then I'm going to click on rename which is going to rename this file but still you can see unsaved changes so to save these changes you need to click on file and then click on save and checkpoint and once again when I open that terminal so I'm going to open the new terminal and on the terminal I will go to the location where I have created this file so CD documents and then python and here when I do LS you will see this file is created which is first notebook which is the name of my file you can see here with the extension IP Y and B okay so you this is how you can run the Jupiter notebook using the terminal you can also launch this Jupiter notebook using anaconda navigator also now let me close this browser and let me also close this notebook Jupiter server so in order to close this Jupiter notebook server you just need to press ctrl C here and then press Y and then press ENTER and you will come out of this server so I'm going to close this terminal once again and on the next terminal this time I want to start the Spyder IDE using this terminal so just write Spyder and then press ENTER and if you see this message which says segmentation fault or any other error you can first of all update the spider version using the Conda command so just write Conda update spider and then press ENTER which is going to update the version of spider on your bun to operating system and once you have updated the version of spider using Conda you can also run this command which is Conda install and then PI OpenGL ok and then press ENTER once again and now you just need to press Y to proceed and once this command is successful we are going to run this spider command once again in order to launch the spider and you can see the spider is now open so first of all I'm going to click on OK here and in order to run some command or run this Python script I can for example write something here so I just want to write pi plus five and then I can select this line which I have written which is five plus five and then press shift enter in order to execute this command and you will see here the output of this expression is printed here if you want to execute the whole file for example I will just write here prin and inside the parentheses I will just print HelloWorld and I will save my file and I can also press this green button which is used to run your Python file and you can see hello world is again printed once again I will just correct the spelling of hello here and then once again I'm going to run this program and you can see this script has been executed by this spider IDE and the output you will be able to see on the console here so this is how you can download and install anaconda with Jupiter notebook and spider IDE I hope you have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
