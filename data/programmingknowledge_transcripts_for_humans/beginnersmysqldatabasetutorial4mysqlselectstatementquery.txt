00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video we have seen how to insert
00:06 - data into your tables and how to write a
00:10 - query for inserting data into your
00:13 - tables in this video we will see how to
00:17 - use a select statement and what is a
00:21 - select statement and how it can be
00:24 - used so let's get
00:27 - started suppose you are using a Java
00:32 - application or Java
00:34 - software and from which you want to see
00:38 - a
00:40 - database in the form of table so what
00:44 - query you should write to see all the
00:50 - data from your database table I will
00:54 - show you
00:56 - today
00:58 - so go to your query tab here and for
01:05 - example I want to
01:10 - see this
01:13 - data from the table so I want to see
01:16 - employee ID name surname and
01:20 - age and these values
01:24 - also from my database so how can I see
01:28 - with the help of query let's see see I
01:31 - will
01:33 - write
01:36 - select and keep in
01:38 - mind my SQL or most of the SQL language
01:42 - are not case sensitive so you can write
01:48 - in capital also you can write in small
01:51 - letter also it will work totally fine
01:55 - it's not case sensitive
01:57 - so it's a good point to remember and
02:01 - then I will write
02:04 - select then
02:06 - your column name
02:10 - so your column name
02:13 - is Eid name surname and age so we will
02:17 - write
02:19 - e comma name
02:24 - comma so name comma
02:28 - age and then
02:31 - write
02:34 - from your database or database table so
02:38 - you can
02:40 - write database
02:43 - dot
02:45 - e data
02:49 - and just close the query with a
02:53 - semicolon so what I have written is
02:56 - select the column
02:58 - names which is which is employee ID name
03:01 - surname and
03:03 - age
03:05 - from your database name which is this
03:10 - dot your table name which is
03:13 - this and now I will try to execute this
03:19 - query and you can see all my
03:25 - database or all my table is shown here
03:30 - in the same way when you write a query
03:33 - and your database is connected to a
03:36 - software it will show this data this
03:39 - same data when you pass this query from
03:43 - that
03:45 - software using
03:47 - MySQL suppose you don't want to see all
03:50 - your
03:51 - table you
03:54 - can select this suppose you want to see
03:58 - only
04:00 - Eid and name so just delete soame and
04:06 - age and just try select Eid comma name
04:11 - from your
04:12 - database and when you execute this query
04:15 - you can see only your Eid and name
04:21 - is shown by the query the other way of
04:25 - using select statement is if you want to
04:28 - so show whole table whole data of your
04:33 - table you can write star if you write
04:37 - star it will select your whole
04:40 - table from your database so let's see
04:45 - how it
04:46 - works yes so it shows your whole table
04:50 - so select star from your database. table
04:56 - will also work as a
04:58 - query so in this way you can show and
05:02 - you can use select statement using
05:06 - MySQL I hope you have learned something
05:08 - new this time please wrate comment and
