00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - particular video so guys this is the
00:06 - part 2 of our C programming language
00:09 - tutorial and as a sort of review from
00:13 - the previous video we have like talked
00:16 - about the basics the introduction to C
00:19 - language
00:20 - the features and other information that
00:23 - we have discussed in the previous video
00:25 - so for this particular video guys we're
00:28 - going to talk about our first program or
00:34 - C program so basically we also discuss
00:38 - how to install code blocks and here you
00:41 - can see I'm using code blocks to create
00:43 - our C program ok so here we have the
00:47 - basic basic program or basic C program
00:52 - okay and before that we or I'm going to
00:57 - show you how to create project here in
00:59 - code luxe IDE so the first thing that
01:02 - we're gonna need is to create a project
01:05 - so instead of using this particular file
01:10 - test that C we're going to close that
01:12 - and then create our new project so let's
01:15 - go to file and then new and then there's
01:20 - an option here for creating our project
01:23 - so basically all we have to do is select
01:27 - here the type of application that we
01:30 - want so for example we're going to just
01:33 - create a basic application or basic C
01:38 - program so let's try to find that here
01:41 - in this options so we're going to select
01:45 - the first one which is the console
01:48 - application because we're going to start
01:51 - with a very basic application C go and
01:56 - then X so it should be C project title
02:02 - will be programming knowledge tutorials
02:08 - and then let's just select the actual
02:13 - directory do you directory to use so
02:16 - let's just say the documents and then
02:19 - we're going to create a new file here or
02:23 - a new directory see projects then ok in
02:30 - the next and then we don't want to mess
02:34 - around here so just basically finish the
02:38 - research for an ounce of an ish so we
02:41 - have here our project programming
02:43 - knowledge tutorials and we have here the
02:45 - sources and by default it created this
02:50 - particular file main that see so as you
02:54 - can see we have here some parts or
02:57 - pre-populated code for us so we have the
03:02 - very basic structure of a basic C
03:05 - application so if you try to run this
03:09 - let's just let's just try to run this
03:11 - first before we go any further with our
03:13 - tutorial so let's just run and then it
03:17 - it will ask to build our project so of
03:23 - course yes and then there you go you can
03:26 - see here the hello world
03:29 - tax so basically what this program is
03:33 - doing is just printing hello world
03:35 - string or text into our monitor or this
03:39 - particular console so press any key to
03:44 - continue or you can just close this
03:46 - particular command prompt
03:49 - okay so let's if you want to make the
03:55 - text or the code bigger you can just
03:57 - control scroll by using your keyboard
04:01 - and your mouse of course so I'm just
04:03 - going to make it bigger so that you will
04:06 - you will be able to see what I what I am
04:09 - doing here with our project so first I'm
04:14 - going to discuss first the parts of this
04:17 - particular program or basic program C so
04:21 - basically we
04:22 - the lines one into so basically it is
04:27 - the like import statement of this
04:31 - particular program so it is basically
04:33 - saying that we need this files and we
04:38 - need to include this in our new program
04:40 - or a new file mean that C so we have
04:44 - here the include and then stdio that H
04:49 - and include STD Li be that H so
04:55 - basically this our header files okay so
04:58 - this our files and we need functions
05:02 - from those files of so for example we
05:04 - have here the function spin F here so
05:08 - this particular function is inside or
05:11 - can be found in stdio that H file ok and
05:18 - here we also have the in main as you can
05:24 - see here so the in main is the main
05:27 - function this is the entry point of
05:30 - every program in C language so in normal
05:34 - terms it is basically the entrance and
05:37 - every time we run our project it will
05:40 - try to find the main function of our
05:46 - project so it should have like one main
05:51 - function for in order for us to run our
05:55 - program so in main so basically it says
05:58 - that the return type is an int and then
06:02 - everything inside these curly braces
06:05 - open and close curly braces is part of
06:08 - this particular function main and we
06:12 - have two lines here so printf and then
06:15 - semicolon and then return zero and then
06:20 - semicolon so this are the lines of our
06:23 - in main function so in order to
06:29 - terminate a line you need to add
06:30 - semicolon at the end of the particular
06:32 - line so just like this here and
06:35 - of course just like right after it is
06:39 - returned zero so now I'm going to
06:41 - explain what this function does so the
06:45 - print f is a function used to print data
06:48 - on console so basically we're just
06:51 - selling a program to output hello world
06:54 - and then it should return zero so return
07:00 - zero statement it means that the return
07:05 - execution status of this particular
07:07 - program and the zero value is used used
07:11 - for successful execution and one for and
07:15 - successful execution so let's try to run
07:20 - this again anyway you can just run or
07:25 - build and run your project or you can
07:27 - just run it by pressing this particular
07:31 - Run button okay so as you can see here
07:35 - we have this particular string or output
07:39 - hello world and if you try to add a new
07:42 - line for our program printf and then
07:47 - everything that we want to display it
07:50 - should be inside the double codes
07:53 - okay C programming is awesome okay and
08:01 - then of course we need to end this and
08:04 - this particular line by adding the
08:06 - semicolon at the end and then save you
08:10 - can just build and run so as you can see
08:14 - here hello world and then C programming
08:17 - is awesome so notice that we have added
08:21 - this particular character here backslash
08:25 - n so we're just telling the program to
08:29 - add another line or to go on to a new
08:32 - line after printing the heel over for
08:34 - the hello world string this one and
08:37 - let's try this also for this particular
08:41 - second line and peeled and run okay so
08:46 - as you can see
08:48 - after printing the c programming is
08:50 - awesome it added a new line here which
08:53 - you can see as a space between C program
08:56 - awesome tax and process return zero so
09:01 - there are others there are other tax or
09:05 - other keywords also for this setup using
09:10 - slash or backslash n you can use
09:14 - backslash T for a tub or for topping so
09:19 - let's try that save and then build and
09:23 - run so as you can see there is a
09:26 - significant space between programming
09:29 - word and the word is so this will come
09:34 - in handy if you're trying to work with
09:35 - like tabular data so backslash T will be
09:41 - like very useful for you because it will
09:44 - format the columns for you and as I've
09:50 - said it will be a great help okay so I
09:53 - think that's all for this particular
09:55 - tutorial guys in the next video we're
09:57 - going to dig deeper with our C
09:59 - programming language tutorial and I hope
10:02 - you enjoyed this particular video and if
10:04 - you have questions please let us know in
10:07 - the comment section below by the way if
10:09 - you are new here in your youtube channel
10:10 - and you want content about programming
10:12 - so i am inviting you to subscribe and
10:15 - press the notification bell so you'll
10:17 - get updated whenever we have a new
10:19 - upload so thank you for watching and see
10:21 - you in the next video
