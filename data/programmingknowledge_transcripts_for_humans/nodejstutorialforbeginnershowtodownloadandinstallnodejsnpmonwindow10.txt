00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - node.js on your windows 10 operating
00:07 - system
00:08 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:10 - we can download
00:11 - node.js so just open your favorite
00:14 - browser and search for node.js
00:16 - and the first link which will appear
00:17 - here will be from nodejs.org so we are
00:20 - going to just click on this link
00:23 - now at the time of making this video you
00:24 - can see the latest version of node.js
00:27 - is 15.14.1
00:31 - and the latest ltest version is
00:34 - 14.16.1 i generally
00:37 - choose the lts version so i'm going to
00:40 - just click
00:41 - on this option which says 14.16.1
00:46 - lts which is going to download the msi
00:48 - file
00:50 - for the node.js so once this msi file is
00:53 - downloaded i'm going to just click on
00:55 - this msi file
00:56 - and i'm going to minimize the browser
00:59 - and you can
01:00 - see this installation wizard for
01:04 - your nodejs so i'm going to just click
01:06 - on next here
01:08 - you can read the license terms and
01:10 - conditions and then click on
01:12 - accept and then click on next this will
01:15 - be the location of your node.js
01:17 - installation so if you don't have the
01:19 - good reason to change this location just
01:21 - leave it as default
01:23 - and then click on next and then click on
01:25 - next
01:26 - and on the next window you can see uh
01:29 - this
01:29 - message which says tools for native
01:32 - modules optionally install the tools
01:35 - necessary to compile native modules
01:38 - so i will definitely recommend you to
01:40 - check this check box
01:41 - which is going to automatically install
01:44 - the necessary tools
01:45 - and also it's going to install a tool
01:48 - called
01:48 - chocolaty which is very good utility and
01:52 - you can use
01:53 - this tool to install many other
01:56 - softwares also right so no harm in it
02:00 - i'm going to just click on next here and
02:02 - then click on install
02:04 - and now i'm going to click on yes which
02:06 - is going to start the installation
02:07 - process
02:08 - which is going to take few seconds so
02:10 - just wait for a few seconds
02:12 - until the installation is finished so
02:15 - once the installation of node.js
02:17 - finishes on your windows 10 operating
02:19 - system
02:20 - you will be able to see this kind of
02:22 - message which says node.js has been
02:24 - successfully installed
02:26 - so you can just click on finish button
02:28 - and this is going to
02:29 - open this kind of terminal and because
02:32 - we have chosen the option to install the
02:34 - additional tools
02:36 - it's going to just wait for us to press
02:38 - the enter button
02:40 - and when i press the enter button it's
02:42 - going to start
02:43 - the installation of the additional tools
02:47 - right so you can just wait for the
02:50 - installation of the additional tool for
02:53 - node.js and now you can just click on
02:55 - yes here
02:56 - which is going to open the powershell
02:58 - and here you just need to press
03:00 - enter and it's going to just
03:04 - use the chocolaty uh installation
03:08 - to install the necessary tools right so
03:10 - you can see
03:12 - it's downloading this chocolaty first of
03:14 - all
03:15 - and then once this tool is installed
03:19 - it's going to download the additional
03:21 - node.js tools
03:23 - so you can leave this window uh like
03:25 - this you can just minimize it don't
03:27 - close this window
03:29 - and we can already move to the testing
03:32 - of
03:32 - nodejs so when you click on
03:36 - this windows icon here you will be able
03:39 - to see
03:40 - this node.js command prompt here also
03:42 - you can see the node.js
03:45 - option here both the option are going to
03:47 - open the command prompt
03:49 - so when you click on node.js command
03:50 - prompt it's going to open
03:52 - the command prompt like this let me just
03:56 - just change the font size so you can see
04:00 - everything in bigger font let's say
04:04 - so i'm going to just click on ok and the
04:07 - font size
04:08 - has been increased right so here you can
04:10 - just type
04:11 - node and then press enter which is going
04:13 - to
04:14 - open the node repel so this kind of node
04:18 - rebel is very useful when you want to
04:20 - quickly test
04:22 - some commands and even you can test more
04:25 - complicated stuff so for example i'm
04:27 - going to
04:28 - just write console.log here
04:32 - and inside these parentheses i can add
04:35 - either double quotes or single quotes
04:39 - and then i can just type hello world
04:42 - here
04:43 - and then press enter which is going to
04:45 - just print hello world
04:47 - also you can do some basic arithmetic
04:50 - operations
04:50 - or you can import some modules here and
04:54 - test
04:54 - those modules so everything is possible
04:57 - using this terminal also if you want to
05:01 - open your windows 10 command prompt
05:04 - you can just right click on the windows
05:07 - icon here
05:08 - and you can open the powershell from
05:11 - here
05:11 - and in the powershell also you can just
05:13 - go to the properties
05:15 - and then you can change the font size
05:18 - from here
05:19 - and now you can just write
05:23 - node and then press enter which is going
05:26 - to open the node
05:28 - apple utility also here in your power
05:31 - shell
05:32 - or if you want to test this command in
05:34 - the command prompt of your windows 10
05:36 - you can just type
05:37 - cmd which is going to give you this
05:40 - command prompt
05:40 - option you can just click on this
05:43 - command prompt and then
05:44 - type node here which is going to once
05:47 - again open
05:48 - this kind of node replica environment
05:52 - which means you can test your node.js on
05:55 - the command prompt also and here also
05:58 - you can change the properties
06:00 - and then make the font size bigger and
06:04 - now you can see the font size in a
06:06 - bigger font
06:08 - now here you can press ctrl c in order
06:11 - to come
06:12 - out of your node ripple here
06:15 - so you can see when you press ctrl c it
06:18 - says press ctrl
06:20 - c again in order to exit you can once
06:23 - again
06:23 - press ctrl c and then you are out of
06:26 - the node environment
06:30 - also you can type dot exit
06:33 - to exit out also so when i type
06:36 - node once again when i want to exit out
06:39 - of the node i can just
06:40 - write dot exit which is also going to
06:43 - cancel the
06:44 - node rebel environment right and by the
06:47 - way if you are confused
06:49 - what is repel repl
06:52 - repel stands for read evaluate
06:56 - print loop which is essentially an
06:58 - interactive shell
07:00 - which processes the node js expressions
07:03 - and commands so this is how you can use
07:06 - node.js
07:07 - in the command prompt now generally when
07:09 - you want to write
07:10 - a node.js code you obviously need some
07:13 - kind of
07:14 - editor or ide to write your node.js code
07:19 - i generally use visual studio code for
07:21 - developing my node.js applications
07:24 - but you can choose any other ide
07:27 - or editor of your choice but for now
07:30 - what i'm going to do is
07:31 - i don't have any installation of any
07:34 - kind of
07:34 - editor here so i will show you if you
07:37 - don't have any editor
07:39 - on your windows 10 operating system then
07:42 - also you can
07:43 - just write your node.js code but it will
07:46 - not
07:46 - be very convenient i would say so
07:50 - just go to the folder where you want to
07:53 - create your node.js file and then
07:56 - you can just click on view here and then
07:58 - click on
08:00 - uh file name extension so just check
08:02 - this option
08:03 - which is going to allow you to uh view
08:06 - the file extensions
08:07 - right now here right click and then
08:11 - you can click on new and then you can
08:14 - just
08:14 - click on text document and you can see
08:19 - that this document is created with
08:22 - uh dot txt extension right so i'm going
08:26 - to just change the name of this file as
08:29 - hello dot js file so you generally
08:33 - write the node.js code in the dot
08:36 - js files so i'm going to just press
08:39 - enter
08:40 - and on windows 10 it's going to give you
08:42 - this kind of warning
08:43 - i'm going to just click on yes here
08:45 - which is going to create this
08:47 - hello.js file now you can edit this file
08:50 - by just right clicking on this file and
08:53 - then click on
08:54 - edit and here you can
08:57 - just search for the basic hello world
09:00 - node.js program online
09:04 - on the node.js website also i'm going to
09:06 - just put this link
09:08 - in the description in the getting
09:10 - started
09:11 - guide you will be able to see uh this
09:14 - sample code
09:15 - which you can test right so i'm going to
09:17 - just copy the sample
09:19 - code here and then i can just
09:22 - paste this code here basic basically
09:25 - what it's going to do is it's going to
09:28 - uh
09:28 - start your server on your
09:32 - local host and on your port
09:36 - 3000 you just need to know this here
09:39 - so just press ctrl s
09:42 - or you can just click on the file option
09:45 - and then click on save
09:47 - once the project is saved just close
09:49 - this file
09:50 - so here go to the folder in which your
09:54 - hello.js file is there and then press
09:57 - shift key and then right click in the
10:00 - same folder
10:01 - which is going to allow you to open
10:04 - the command prompt or the powershell in
10:07 - the same folder
10:09 - where your hello.js file is there so
10:12 - just choose this option which is open
10:14 - powershell window here
10:16 - or you will see open command prompt
10:19 - uh here right both options are okay and
10:22 - now here
10:23 - you just need to write this command node
10:26 - and then the name of the file
10:28 - which is hello dot js
10:31 - right and then press enter which is
10:33 - going to
10:34 - start your node.js server on
10:38 - this ip address and this port
10:41 - which is essentially localhost 3000
10:45 - so once again you can go to your web
10:47 - browser
10:48 - and then just type 127.0.0.1
10:54 - and then colon 3000 and then press
10:57 - enter which is going to show you hello
10:59 - world that means
11:01 - your node.js server is working
11:04 - fine and this is how you can write your
11:07 - node.js code and execute
11:09 - the js file this is how you can download
11:13 - and install
11:14 - node.js on your windows 10 operating
11:16 - system
11:17 - i hope you enjoyed this video and i will
11:19 - see you in the next video

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can download and install node.js on your windows 10 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can download node.js so just open
