00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use
00:05 - checkboxes radio button and group boxes
00:08 - with your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:11 - application so let's get started first
00:14 - of all I will go to my toolbox and I
00:16 - will drag and drop a group box and I
00:20 - will take two group boxes here to
00:23 - demonstrate checkboxes and radio
00:26 - buttons so what I will do is I will in
00:30 - the first group box I will drag and drop
00:34 - two check
00:35 - boxes and in the second group box two
00:40 - which is group box two I will drag drop
00:44 - two radio buttons okay so a group is a
00:49 - container in which you can group your
00:54 - tools so for example when I run the
00:57 - program and when I check this these
01:02 - check boxes you can notice that I can
01:06 - check both of them at the same time and
01:10 - when I check radio button and when I
01:13 - check one radio button and when I'm
01:15 - going to check the other radio
01:18 - button you see that when the radio
01:22 - button is in a group we can only check
01:26 - one radio button at a time right so this
01:30 - is the basic difference in checkbox and
01:33 - radio buttons checkboxes you
01:37 - can generally
01:39 - check multiple checkboxes in a group and
01:43 - you can check only one radio button at a
01:47 - time in a group box and by the name
01:51 - itself also uh suggest that checkboxes
01:55 - we use for multiple checking right and
01:59 - radio button are generally used for one
02:02 - in multiple
02:04 - options so that's said and
02:09 - done now
02:11 - let's see how we can use them so first
02:15 - of all this first group box for example
02:19 - I want to show the
02:23 - age so I will change
02:26 - the title of this group box and I will
02:30 - say checkbox
02:33 - one under
02:36 - 15 checkbox 2 text
02:41 - is under
02:44 - 25 and let me take one
02:48 - more
02:50 - checkbox so the third checkbox will when
02:55 - I check it it shows the age
03:00 - uh on or over 25 I will
03:04 - say
03:06 - over 25 okay so I have these three
03:10 - checkboxes right and for example I will
03:13 - add a button also which says show age so
03:20 - when I press this button whatever
03:22 - checkbox is checked it will show the age
03:25 - so I'll say show age button and now I
03:29 - will select this button and double click
03:31 - it and in here I will give three
03:35 - conditions the three conditions are like
03:39 - this so checkbox
03:44 - two and let's see the name of these
03:46 - checkboxes so checkbox one second
03:51 - checkbox is checkbox two and third
03:53 - checkbox is checkbox
03:55 - 3
03:57 - Okay so
04:07 - now we have three conditions
04:10 - here if we write if checkbook one is
04:13 - checked then I will show the message
04:16 - that age is under 15 if my checkbox 2 is
04:20 - checked then I will say the age is under
04:23 - 25 and the third checkbox is checked if
04:27 - then uh I will say age is over
04:31 - 25 so when I run the program and I check
04:35 - one of these buttons you see the message
04:38 - age is under 20 15 and age is under
04:43 - 25 and age is over 25 okay
04:49 - now if you notice that when I check
04:52 - these multiple buttons it will only show
04:56 - this
04:57 - first of the
05:00 - age and not other ages so to make this
05:06 - more flexible what we can do is we can
05:11 - write this kind
05:15 - of code we will just use if and else
05:22 - condition like this so just let me
05:25 - complete
05:28 - the code and then I will show
05:33 - you so
05:36 - now we have the condition like this if
05:41 - first checkbox is checked then this
05:44 - message will be shown and this condition
05:47 - is finished here if second text box is
05:50 - checked then this condition will be true
05:55 - and this message will be shown and
05:57 - accordingly the third message and now
06:00 - when we run the
06:02 - program and when we check all these
06:05 - three options we see AG is under 15 AG
06:09 - is under 25 and AG is over 25 so in this
06:14 - way you can use
06:16 - checkboxes and in the same way you can
06:20 - also use radio
06:22 - buttons by using this button but one
06:26 - other way is just select your your radio
06:30 - button this is also true for checkboxes
06:33 - and double click it
06:36 - and you can say that when radio button
06:39 - is checked or when it's changed then you
06:45 - can change something so for
06:51 - example
06:53 - button
06:56 - one
06:58 - dot enable
07:00 - abled is equal
07:06 - to or radio
07:13 - button radio button
07:15 - [Music]
07:17 - one
07:20 - dot
07:24 - checked okay so when you give this
07:28 - condition
07:31 - then and run your
07:32 - program and when you click this
07:39 - button and when you see this it's
07:43 - disabled because my radio button is
07:45 - unchecked and when I check this button
07:48 - it's
07:49 - enabled right
07:51 - disabled and
07:54 - enabled or you can declare a global
07:57 - variable like this
08:01 - dim or your
08:04 - name
08:06 - where
08:10 - as whatever integer or message you want
08:13 - to
08:16 - show
08:18 - integer and this variable you can use it
08:22 - here when radio button one is changed or
08:26 - checked and then you you can say
08:30 - variable is equal to
08:32 - 15
08:34 - right so you can use it like this also
08:38 - and there are other properties also for
08:41 - example you select a radio button you
08:44 - can choose whether it should be checked
08:47 - true or false for example
08:50 - I check mark it true you see here it's
08:54 - checked and there are other properties
08:57 - which you can uh play with and see what
09:01 - happens when you change these properties
09:04 - okay so I hope you have understand the
09:07 - basic use of these check boxes and radio
09:10 - buttons and I hope you have enjoyed this
09:12 - video please rate comment and subscribe
09:14 - and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to use checkboxes radio button and group boxes with your Visual Basic Windows Form application so let's get started first of all I will go to my toolbox and I will drag and drop a group box and I will take two group boxes here to demonstrate checkboxes and radio buttons so what I will do is I will in the first group box I will drag and drop two check boxes and in the second group box two which is group box two I will drag drop two radio buttons okay so a group is a container in which you can group your tools so for example when I run the program and when I check this these check boxes you can notice that I can check both of them at the same time and when I check radio button and when I check one radio button and when I'm going to check the other radio button you see that when the radio button is in a group we can only check one radio button at a time right so this is the basic difference in checkbox and radio buttons checkboxes you can generally check multiple checkboxes in a group and you can check only one radio button at a time in a group box and by the name itself also uh suggest that checkboxes we use for multiple checking right and radio button are generally used for one in multiple options so that's said and done now let's see how we can use them so first of all this first group box for example I want to show the age so I will change the title of this group box and I will say checkbox one under 15 checkbox 2 text is under 25 and let me take one more checkbox so the third checkbox will when I check it it shows the age uh on or over 25 I will say over 25 okay so I have these three checkboxes right and for example I will add a button also which says show age so when I press this button whatever checkbox is checked it will show the age so I'll say show age button and now I will select this button and double click it and in here I will give three conditions the three conditions are like this so checkbox two and let's see the name of these checkboxes so checkbox one second checkbox is checkbox two and third checkbox is checkbox 3 Okay so now we have three conditions here if we write if checkbook one is checked then I will show the message that age is under 15 if my checkbox 2 is checked then I will say the age is under 25 and the third checkbox is checked if then uh I will say age is over 25 so when I run the program and I check one of these buttons you see the message age is under 20 15 and age is under 25 and age is over 25 okay now if you notice that when I check these multiple buttons it will only show this first of the age and not other ages so to make this more flexible what we can do is we can write this kind of code we will just use if and else condition like this so just let me complete the code and then I will show you so now we have the condition like this if first checkbox is checked then this message will be shown and this condition is finished here if second text box is checked then this condition will be true and this message will be shown and accordingly the third message and now when we run the program and when we check all these three options we see AG is under 15 AG is under 25 and AG is over 25 so in this way you can use checkboxes and in the same way you can also use radio buttons by using this button but one other way is just select your your radio button this is also true for checkboxes and double click it and you can say that when radio button is checked or when it's changed then you can change something so for example button one dot enable abled is equal to or radio button radio button one dot checked okay so when you give this condition then and run your program and when you click this button and when you see this it's disabled because my radio button is unchecked and when I check this button it's enabled right disabled and enabled or you can declare a global variable like this dim or your name where as whatever integer or message you want to show integer and this variable you can use it here when radio button one is changed or checked and then you you can say variable is equal to 15 right so you can use it like this also and there are other properties also for example you select a radio button you can choose whether it should be checked true or false for example I check mark it true you see here it's checked and there are other properties which you can uh play with and see what happens when you change these properties okay so I hope you have understand the basic use of these check boxes and radio buttons and I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
