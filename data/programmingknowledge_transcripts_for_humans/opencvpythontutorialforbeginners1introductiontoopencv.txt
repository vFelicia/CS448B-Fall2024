00:00 - hey guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - open CV tutorial for beginners using
00:05 - Python in this video I'm going to give
00:08 - you a brief introduction about open CV
00:10 - but first of all let's see what is
00:13 - computer vision because open CV is an
00:17 - open source computer vision library so
00:20 - computer vision is the way of teaching
00:23 - intelligence to machines and making them
00:26 - see things just like humans so what
00:29 - happens when a human see an image he
00:33 - will be able to recognize the faces
00:35 - which are there inside the images so in
00:39 - its simplest form computer vision is
00:41 - what allows computers to see and process
00:45 - visual data just like humans
00:47 - computer vision involves analyzing
00:50 - images to produce useful information so
00:54 - to give you some examples a self-driving
00:56 - car it can detects the lanes using
01:00 - computer visions or you might have
01:02 - wondered how Facebook detects images
01:05 - when you upload the images of you with
01:08 - your friends it becomes possible by
01:11 - Facebook's face an image recognition
01:13 - technology so now let's see what is open
01:16 - CV so open CV which stands for open
01:20 - source computer vision is a library of
01:23 - programming functions mainly aimed at
01:26 - real-time computer vision it is
01:29 - originally developed by Intel and then
01:32 - it was later supported by a developer
01:35 - called Willow Garage
01:36 - and now it is supported and maintained
01:39 - by ITC's now open CV is available on Mac
01:43 - Windows and various Linux operating
01:45 - systems so we can say that open CV is a
01:48 - cross-platform library now you can work
01:51 - on open CV using C C++ or Python and we
01:55 - will be using Python to learn open CV
01:58 - now open CV is a open source and free
02:02 - library which is licensed under BSD
02:06 - license and it's said that it is very
02:09 - easy to use an installer that we will
02:12 - see when we will install open
02:14 - CV on various operating systems now
02:17 - because open CV primarily deals with
02:21 - computer vision that means dealing with
02:23 - mainly images or videos so I wanted to
02:27 - show you how a digital image is seen by
02:32 - a computer so digital images are
02:34 - typically stored in the form of matrix
02:37 - now if you have heard about PPI or pixel
02:42 - per inch which refers display resolution
02:45 - that means how many individual pixels
02:48 - are displayed in one inch of digital
02:52 - image so when a computer sees a picture
02:55 - it sees it in the form of pixel matrix
03:00 - now there are two type of digital images
03:03 - one are called grayscale images and
03:06 - other are called colored images so in
03:09 - grayscale images each pixel represents
03:12 - the intensity of only one shade that
03:16 - means how bright or dark the pixel is in
03:20 - other word it is said that it has only
03:23 - one channel so on the right hand side
03:26 - you can see a grayscale image and on the
03:29 - left hand side you can see a colored
03:32 - image so in colored images we have three
03:36 - channels that is our GB which stands for
03:40 - red green blue so grayscale images have
03:44 - one channel and colored images have
03:48 - three channels your standard digital
03:51 - camera have three channels that means
03:54 - red green blue channels so we will learn
03:56 - more about images and how we can process
03:59 - images using OpenCV in the later videos
04:03 - now there is one more thing which I want
04:05 - to show you is numpy so we are going to
04:10 - learn OpenCV using Python so when you
04:12 - will install OpenCV library for python
04:15 - on your operating system numpy will be
04:18 - automatically installed with this
04:21 - library so first of all what is numb by
04:24 - so numpy is a highly optimized library
04:27 - for numerical operations now as I told
04:31 - you digital images are 2d arrays of
04:33 - pixels and numpy library is a
04:36 - general-purpose array processing package
04:39 - library so it provides a
04:41 - high-performance multi-dimensional array
04:44 - object and tools for working with these
04:48 - arrays which makes the processing of
04:51 - images easier now all the opencv array
04:54 - structures are converted to and
04:56 - converted from numpy arrays and in
05:00 - addition you can use more convenient
05:03 - indexing system rather than using for
05:07 - loops so when you want to learn OpenCV
05:10 - using Python you need to have some
05:13 - knowledge about numpy also so if you
05:16 - have some knowledge of Nampa library
05:18 - it's good but don't worry I will teach
05:20 - you step by step so you will not miss
05:22 - anything so that was a brief
05:25 - introduction about computer vision and
05:27 - OpenCV in the next video I'm going to
05:29 - show you how you can install Python
05:32 - OpenCV library and then we will see how
05:35 - we can work with this OpenCV library so
05:38 - that's it for this video I will see you
05:40 - in the next video
05:49 - you
