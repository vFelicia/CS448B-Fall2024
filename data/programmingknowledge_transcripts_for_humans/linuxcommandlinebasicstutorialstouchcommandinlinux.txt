With timestamps:

00:00 - how we can create files in linux using
00:02 - touch command okay so here and here in
00:04 - both sides there is file series files
00:06 - okay
00:06 - and i will move into that particular
00:09 - directory
00:11 - files
00:12 - okay and now what i will do i will
00:14 - create
00:15 - some files using touch command okay
00:18 - so i will do
00:20 - touch
00:21 - file one dot txt
00:24 - okay so basically what this command will
00:26 - do it will just uh like delete the uh
00:29 - day sorry i'm saying delete it will just
00:31 - create file one dot txt
00:33 - okay but that file will be empty for you
00:36 - like there will be you cannot write
00:38 - anything at that time you will need to
00:40 - first open that file then you will need
00:41 - to write in that it okay but there are
00:44 - also some ways where we can perform both
00:46 - things
00:47 - like uh
00:48 - simultaneously we can like create files
00:51 - and we can write something
00:52 - in that also but this we will see in the
00:54 - next video okay
00:56 - so first we will uh talk about this
00:59 - touch command so now i will hit enter
01:03 - and i will do ls and here you will see
01:05 - like file1.txt
01:08 - will be
01:09 - created okay
01:11 - so i hope it is clear to you and now
01:14 - what if i want to create multiple files
01:16 - okay
01:17 - then i can
01:18 - easily do with file2.txt
01:22 - file3.txt
01:26 - file for dot txt
01:29 - and i will just hit enter
01:31 - sorry ls
01:32 - and here you can see all these and four
01:35 - files have been created okay
01:37 - so this is the one way to create files
01:40 - okay
01:41 - and now with the touch command like we
01:43 - can use
01:44 - various options with it like hyphen a
01:47 - hyphen m
01:49 - hyphen r also we can use it so i will
01:52 - start with the first one that is hyphen
01:55 - a option
01:56 - basically what this option does
01:58 - like it will change the access time of
02:01 - your file
02:03 - suppose now we have created this file
02:05 - let me do ls hyphen l
02:08 - okay
02:09 - so file one has been created at uh this
02:12 - one
02:13 - 12 42 am okay
02:15 - and this is 43 and all these things so
02:18 - basically this is the modification time
02:20 - okay if you want to look at the access
02:23 - time you will need to hit ls hyphen l u
02:27 - okay
02:28 - uh access time 42 okay
02:31 - the hyphen l option will show you the
02:34 - modification time hyphen lu option will
02:36 - show you the access time when the file
02:38 - is accessed
02:40 - okay
02:40 - so what i'm going to do
02:43 - i will try to access this file
02:46 - and now 12 44 it is okay
02:49 - so i have access this file okay i will
02:52 - write something
02:53 - hi
02:54 - okay and i will just
02:57 - close it
02:58 - and again i will do this i need to find
03:01 - the access time
03:03 - so here you can see the
03:05 - 12 44 is now the
03:07 - access time of file one dot txt okay
03:10 - and i have not visited file to dot txt
03:13 - yet okay so it's access time it is still
03:15 - showing 12 43
03:17 - so now what i have to do
03:20 - i will change the access time using the
03:22 - hyphen a option
03:24 - so how we can do it touch
03:27 - hyphen a
03:29 - and then file
03:30 - name so i want to change the access time
03:33 - for
03:34 - file name uh which one uh let's do for
03:37 - file1.txt
03:38 - okay so it will change my access time
03:41 - from 1244 to the my current time so my
03:44 - current time is what
03:46 - 12 45 okay
03:50 - and now i will do ls iphone lu and here
03:52 - you can see
03:54 - file1.txt
03:55 - okay
03:56 - now what i will do
03:59 - like here we have not
04:01 - uh like uh
04:03 - visited this file to dot txt okay even
04:06 - when you don't open that file we don't
04:09 - write anything in that word default
04:11 - still you can change the access time for
04:13 - it okay
04:14 - suppose or there is someone in your like
04:16 - working environment like you want to
04:18 - change the access time or just for your
04:22 - any kind of purpose okay
04:24 - so what i'm going to do
04:26 - uh touch hyphen a i will just uh
04:31 - change the file name
04:33 - from file one to two
04:35 - okay and now i will do ls hyphen
04:40 - lu
04:41 - and here you can see the access time for
04:43 - file 2 has been
04:45 - like changed now okay it's 12 46
04:50 - okay and now uh i will just clear it all
04:54 - now again i will check the access time
04:56 - so access time is for first one 12 45 12
04:59 - 46
05:01 - and for let's check for modification
05:03 - time that is
05:05 - at the modification of this is flowing
05:06 - 12 44
05:08 - okay and 12 43 12 43 all the y 12 44
05:12 - because uh we you know we have right
05:15 - high in this file one dot txt that's why
05:17 - it's showing 12 44.
05:19 - okay
05:20 - now what if you want to change the
05:22 - modification time instead of
05:24 - this access time so what we i will do
05:27 - now
05:27 - i will just hit uh
05:30 - like work with the hyphen m option okay
05:33 - hyphen m
05:36 - and i will change for
05:38 - file 3.txt
05:42 - and now let's do just ls hyphen l file 3
05:46 - you can do like this also
05:48 - and now it's swing
05:49 - 12 47
05:51 - as here it was 12 43 now the it is
05:54 - modified to the tool 47
05:57 - and here you can see the access time is
05:59 - 1243 so now let's check also the access
06:02 - time for file 3.2 whether it is change
06:04 - or not it will not change because we
06:06 - have not done anything with it so it
06:08 - will be as it is like it is 1243 okay
06:12 - so i hope you got it how it is working
06:14 - the how we can basically change the
06:16 - access time modification time with the
06:18 - touch command okay we are creating files
06:20 - also and we can also manipulate the
06:22 - access time and the modification i'm
06:24 - using this command
06:26 - okay
06:27 - so now uh moving uh forward uh the there
06:30 - is also one option hyphen r
06:32 - okay
06:33 - so basically this option what it will do
06:35 - it will just uh like uh
06:39 - what we can say like copy the access
06:41 - time of first file to the second file
06:44 - okay
06:45 - so now what i will need to do
06:48 - i will show you both the
06:50 - uh
06:53 - access time i will show you for file one
06:55 - dot txt and what i will do
06:57 - touch hyphen r
07:01 - file one
07:03 - and five
07:05 - two dot txt okay
07:07 - and again i will do the ls iphone lu
07:11 - so here you can see the access time for
07:14 - file two dot txt has been changed from
07:16 - 1246 to 1245
07:19 - and now let's check for the modification
07:22 - time for file one and file two so
07:24 - modification time for file one and file
07:26 - two is
07:27 - same okay
07:29 - i hope you got it how it is working in
07:31 - the access time and notification now i
07:33 - hope you got
07:34 - the like how hyphen a hyphen m and
07:37 - iphone r option
07:39 - works together okay
07:40 - so that's all for this video and in the
07:42 - next video we will basically talk about
07:45 - how we can write some kind of like
07:47 - whatever you have to write in the file
07:50 - while creating a file okay
07:52 - so that's it for today and we will meet
07:54 - in the next one so thank you thank you
07:56 - for watching and please do like share
07:58 - and subscribe our channel and if you
08:00 - have any queries then you can ask us in

someone in your like working environment like you want to change the access time or just for your any kind of purpose okay so what i'm going to do uh touch hyphen a i will just uh change the file name from file one to two okay and now i will do ls hyphen lu and here you can see the access time for file 2 has been like changed now okay it's 12 46 okay and now uh i will just clear it all now again i will check the access time so access time is for first one 12 45 12 46 and for let's check for modification time that is at the modification of this is flowing 12 44 okay and 12 43 12 43 all the y 12 44 because uh we you know we have right high in this file one dot txt that's why it's showing 12 44. okay now what if you want to change the modification time instead of this access time so what we i
