06:23 - then under the project layout there are
06:26 - two options use the project folder as
06:28 - the root for the source and the class

07:01 - because I need to minimise this welcome
07:04 - window so just click on this minimize
07:06 - button which is going to minimize this
07:08 - welcome window and then you will be able
07:11 - to see this kind of hello world project
07:14 - here so you can see our Java project has
07:17 - been created and this has a file called
07:21 - module - info dot Java for now I'm going
07:25 - to just remove this file and I will
07:27 - create a new class file so I'm going to
07:31 - just right click on the source and then
07:33 - I'm going to choose new and then I'm
07:35 - going to choose the class option from
07:37 - here and I want to name my class as demo
07:41 - for example and then I'm going to leave
07:44 - everything as default and in here under
07:47 - which method stop would you like to
07:50 - create I'm going to choose this checkbox
07:53 - which says public static void main which
07:56 - is going to create this public static
07:59 - void main method for me and I'm going to
08:01 - click finish for now and this is going
08:04 - to create this demo dot Java class and
08:07 - here you can see public static void main
08:08 - method has been created so let's print
08:11 - something so I'm going to just write
08:13 - system dot out dot print Ln for print
08:20 - line and let's print HelloWorld for now
08:23 - so I'm going to just write hello world
08:26 - in between the double quotes and I'm
08:29 - going to save this Java file and I'm
