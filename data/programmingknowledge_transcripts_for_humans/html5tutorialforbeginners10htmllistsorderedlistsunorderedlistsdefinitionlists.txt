00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - in this video we will see how to use
00:08 - lists in HTML so there are two types of
00:13 - Lists you can use in HTML first is
00:19 - unordered list which is something like
00:21 - this which has no order and second is
00:26 - ordered list which has some kind of
00:29 - ordering it may be numbered ordering or
00:32 - it may be alphabetical ordering or it
00:35 - may be any other kind of ordering so
00:39 - let's see how we can use these type of
00:43 - lists in HTML so first of all we will
00:47 - see how we can create unordered lists
00:51 - okay
00:52 - so to make an unordered list you need
00:56 - the tag called ul which stands for
01:00 - unordered list and inside this tag you
01:04 - need to have list items so just give Li
01:09 - and it will add a list item and inside
01:14 - this list item you can add your name of
01:18 - your list or description of the list
01:20 - okay so I will add two more items like
01:25 - this and then for example I want to have
01:28 - a list of names ok so then what I can do
01:33 - I can just give the name for example
01:39 - something like this okay I will save my
01:42 - code and refresh my webpage it looked
01:45 - like this so this is an unordered list
01:49 - okay now unordered list also can be of
01:52 - different types so you can add attribute
01:56 - called style here and then inside the
02:00 - style attribute value you can add this
02:03 - line so just add a list - style - type
02:09 - and by default the type is disk or
02:13 - description which is like this by
02:16 - default when you save it it'll look like
02:19 - this so it's the default type right but
02:23 - when you change this disk for example -
02:27 - circle like this and save it and refresh
02:32 - your page then you can see you have
02:35 - small bullets in front of your list
02:38 - items right or you can have a square
02:42 - here so Square and save it and refresh
02:45 - your web page and your bullet becomes
02:49 - squared okay or you can have one more
02:53 - option here which is none okay and when
02:58 - you give this option and when you
03:00 - refresh your webpage there is no bullet
03:04 - in front of your list items right so for
03:08 - unordered list you have these items now
03:11 - to create an ordered list first of all I
03:13 - will remove this style attribute from
03:16 - here and to create an ordered list
03:18 - instead of ul you just need to replace
03:21 - it with Oh L which stands for ordered
03:24 - list okay and the default sheet type is
03:28 - numbered type so it will look something
03:31 - like this so one two three four right
03:34 - but this can also change so when you add
03:37 - our attribute called type here and for
03:41 - example by default it's numbered so you
03:43 - can write one here and it becomes
03:46 - numbered list so it's like the same okay
03:50 - and when you replace
03:53 - number one by capital a let's see what
03:57 - happens so I will save it and refresh my
04:00 - web web page and now you can see my list
04:03 - is ordered by capital letters okay
04:07 - for example we want to order our list
04:10 - with small letter you just need to
04:12 - replace this capital a by small a and
04:15 - refresh your web page it will look like
04:17 - this okay or for example you need a
04:21 - Roman numbered ordered list then you
04:26 - just need to write capital I and save it
04:30 - and refresh your web page it becomes
04:33 - Roman letter in capital Roman letter you
04:36 - can say write and same you want in small
04:41 - Roman letters then you just need to
04:44 - write I here and save it and refresh
04:47 - your page and your list becomes small
04:51 - Roman letter ordered list okay now you
04:55 - can also create a nested list so to
04:59 - create a nested list for example my list
05:02 - is ordered list right now and for
05:05 - example I want to list out for each name
05:08 - some favorites for example right so I
05:12 - can go just below my list item where I
05:17 - want to create a list once again and for
05:20 - example I want this time unordered list
05:24 - so I can just write unordered list like
05:27 - this and in here once again I can add
05:30 - list items right
05:32 - for example John likes T and John likes
05:38 - coffee and save it and refresh it and
05:43 - you see it becomes list inside a list so
05:47 - nested list okay so you can also have
05:50 - nested lists like this now you also have
05:53 - one more type of list which is called
05:55 - description list okay and as the name
05:59 - suggests it starts with DL so just write
06:03 - DL and becomes description
06:06 - list and inside this description list
06:08 - you can have description terms or DT
06:12 - which sent for description terms and
06:14 - here you can have some terms so for
06:18 - example term right and then you have a
06:22 - tag called DD which is called
06:25 - description detail and here you can add
06:29 - the detail of this term right so
06:35 - description of the term something like
06:38 - this okay
06:39 - and you can add multiple terms and
06:42 - descriptions and save it and refresh
06:45 - your web page and your term and
06:48 - description of the term looks like this
06:51 - okay so in this way you can use lists in
06:55 - HTML I hope you have enjoyed this video
