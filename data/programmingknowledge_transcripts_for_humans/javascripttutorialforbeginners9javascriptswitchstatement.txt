00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how to use switch
00:07 - statements in JavaScript so let's get
00:10 - started for example I have a variable
00:14 - called score okay and this indicates the
00:18 - score of some student and I will
00:20 - initialize it with 90 right and I'm also
00:24 - going to initialize our variable called
00:28 - uh result to print some result okay now
00:33 - the syntax of switch statement so switch
00:37 - statement is also a kind of statement in
00:40 - which you evaluate some expression and
00:43 - then on the basis of uh expression you
00:47 - give your result or you perform some
00:50 - piece of code okay so let's see what is
00:53 - the syntax of switch statement so you
00:55 - use the keyword called switch and then
00:58 - inside these round bracket comes your
01:01 - expression and then inside the curly
01:04 - braces comes the cases on the basis of
01:08 - which you uh execute some code okay so
01:12 - this is some expression and expression
01:15 - means some condition on the basis of
01:19 - which you decide which case you will
01:22 - perform okay so expression can be score
01:26 - here okay so for example a student is
01:30 - scoring some marks and on the basis of
01:33 - marks we want to display some messages
01:36 - okay so in this case score is an
01:39 - expression and we are evaluating scores
01:42 - and on the basis of scores of student we
01:45 - will perform some code and inside the
01:48 - switch statement comes the cases okay so
01:53 - you can add a case something like this
01:55 - with uh this colon and then you can uh
01:59 - perform your code so for example I just
02:02 - want to uh assign result is equal to
02:06 - some text for example very good okay and
02:12 - once your code is finished you break
02:16 - your switch statement with a keyword
02:19 - called Break okay now in front of a case
02:24 - comes your value so for example we want
02:27 - to uh say if our score is equal to 90
02:31 - then we will uh return a result very
02:35 - good so Here Comes Your value okay now
02:39 - you can Define multiple switch cases
02:42 - inside a switch statement for example
02:45 - something like this and here you can say
02:49 - students scored 60 here you can say
02:52 - student scored 40 for for example and
02:55 - here we can just return good and if he
02:59 - score was 40 we can return okay right
03:03 - now for example uh student doesn't score
03:08 - 90 or 60 or 40 then in which case it
03:14 - will go okay so for this we have a
03:18 - default case right so just write a
03:21 - default uh keyword here and then you say
03:26 - result is equal to
03:28 - unknown okay okay so default condition
03:32 - is executed when neither of the cases
03:36 - are true okay so if the student doesn't
03:39 - score 90 or 60 or 40 then it will go to
03:44 - the default case right now
03:47 - let's return our result and print it
03:51 - using this document. getet element by ID
03:55 - and demo is uh the ID of this paragraph
03:59 - tag here and I'm just assigning result
04:03 - which is this variable here okay so save
04:07 - your code and just notice here that
04:10 - score right now is 90 right so I will
04:13 - refresh my web page here and it says
04:16 - very good because score is 90 let's say
04:19 - score is now 60 save your code and
04:23 - refresh it once again and now the
04:25 - message is printed good right now let's
04:28 - say score is 45 which doesn't satisfy
04:32 - any of the cases then when we go to uh
04:36 - our web page and refresh it it says
04:39 - unknown right so this situation is
04:42 - handled by the default condition right
04:46 - now you can also use some situations in
04:50 - switch cases without the break keyword
04:54 - right so for example I can also write
04:58 - case is equal to 100 here and for
05:02 - example one more case 95 here and if you
05:06 - notice here I am not writing the break
05:09 - keyword after this switch case right so
05:13 - what happens when you don't add a break
05:15 - keyword after a switch case so let's uh
05:19 - save our code and let's say our score is
05:23 - 95 okay which is this condition and save
05:26 - our code and refresh the web page and
05:29 - says very good okay so what's happening
05:33 - here so in the case where the break is
05:37 - not added then it will jumps to the next
05:41 - case and whatever the code in the next
05:45 - case it will execute that code okay so
05:49 - the program flow will be something like
05:51 - this our switch case will evaluate 100
05:54 - and the case is not 100 so it will go to
05:56 - 95 and it finds that 95 is the
06:00 - expression we are looking for but there
06:02 - is no break here so I will switch to the
06:05 - next case and in here the case is 90 and
06:10 - here this message is assigned to the
06:13 - result and then we find that here is the
06:16 - break and then the switch case is broken
06:19 - and then you got your result okay so if
06:22 - you don't add a break after your case it
06:27 - will jump to the next case
06:30 - and perform the code which is under the
06:33 - next case and then if it has break then
06:36 - it will break your switch statement okay
06:39 - so if you want to uh you know uh
06:42 - evaluate multiple expression uh
06:45 - continuously then you use case without a
06:49 - break so in this way you can use switch
06:51 - statements in JavaScript I hope youve

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how to use switch statements in JavaScript so let's get started for example I have a variable called score okay and this indicates the score of some student and I will initialize it with 90 right and I'm also going to initialize our variable called uh result to print some result okay now the syntax of switch statement so switch statement is also a kind of statement in which you evaluate some expression and then on the basis of uh expression you give your result or you perform some piece of code okay so let's see what is the syntax of switch statement so you use the keyword called switch and then inside these round bracket comes your expression and then inside the curly braces comes the cases on the basis of which you uh execute some code okay so this is some expression and expression means some condition on the basis of which you decide which case you will perform okay so expression can be score here okay so for example a student is scoring some marks and on the basis of marks we want to display some messages okay so in this case score is an expression and we are evaluating scores and on the basis of scores of student we will perform some code and inside the switch statement comes the cases okay so you can add a case something like this with uh this colon and then you can uh perform your code so for example I just want to uh assign result is equal to some text for example very good okay and once your code is finished you break your switch statement with a keyword called Break okay now in front of a case comes your value so for example we want to uh say if our score is equal to 90 then we will uh return a result very good so Here Comes Your value okay now you can Define multiple switch cases inside a switch statement for example something like this and here you can say students scored 60 here you can say student scored 40 for for example and here we can just return good and if he score was 40 we can return okay right now for example uh student doesn't score 90 or 60 or 40 then in which case it will go okay so for this we have a default case right so just write a default uh keyword here and then you say result is equal to unknown okay okay so default condition is executed when neither of the cases are true okay so if the student doesn't score 90 or 60 or 40 then it will go to the default case right now let's return our result and print it using this document. getet element by ID and demo is uh the ID of this paragraph tag here and I'm just assigning result which is this variable here okay so save your code and just notice here that score right now is 90 right so I will refresh my web page here and it says very good because score is 90 let's say score is now 60 save your code and refresh it once again and now the message is printed good right now let's say score is 45 which doesn't satisfy any of the cases then when we go to uh our web page and refresh it it says unknown right so this situation is handled by the default condition right now you can also use some situations in switch cases without the break keyword right so for example I can also write case is equal to 100 here and for example one more case 95 here and if you notice here I am not writing the break keyword after this switch case right so what happens when you don't add a break keyword after a switch case so let's uh save our code and let's say our score is 95 okay which is this condition and save our code and refresh the web page and says very good okay so what's happening here so in the case where the break is not added then it will jumps to the next case and whatever the code in the next case it will execute that code okay so the program flow will be something like this our switch case will evaluate 100 and the case is not 100 so it will go to 95 and it finds that 95 is the expression we are looking for but there is no break here so I will switch to the next case and in here the case is 90 and here this message is assigned to the result and then we find that here is the break and then the switch case is broken and then you got your result okay so if you don't add a break after your case it will jump to the next case and perform the code which is under the next case and then if it has break then it will break your switch statement okay so if you want to uh you know uh evaluate multiple expression uh continuously then you use case without a break so in this way you can use switch statements in JavaScript I hope youve enjoyed this video please wait comment subscribe
