00:00 - so guys in this video I will be giving
00:02 - you the five coding questions here you
00:04 - can see and I'm expecting that you guys
00:07 - should give it a try and
00:10 - code it out these problem statements so
00:13 - till now if you are following this
00:15 - series I expect that you are you have
00:17 - watched all those previous videos
00:19 - wherein I'll be talking about the data
00:21 - types and variables with you guys till
00:23 - now so uh in considering that you have
00:27 - watched the previous video I have uh
00:29 - created this list of five coding
00:31 - questions wherein the only concept that
00:34 - is required is data types and Java
00:36 - variables Java variables for you to
00:38 - solve these coding questions okay not
00:41 - more than this and not any another
00:43 - concept that I didn't discuss in this
00:47 - series you don't require this okay so I
00:51 - will just give you a brief overview of
00:52 - each question uh so that that it's like
00:56 - a hint for you to solve these questions
00:57 - okay so in the first question
01:00 - the question is like that write a Java
01:02 - program to convert the temperature from
01:04 - a Fahrenheit to the Celsius degree
01:06 - okay so it's a basic simple Pro Java
01:10 - code you have to perform and the input
01:12 - is like that you given a
01:14 - temperature that is in Fahrenheit and
01:16 - the expected output from your code is
01:19 - that though that fahrenheit's
01:22 - temperature will get converted into
01:23 - Celsius temperature okay you can search
01:25 - for a search into Google for the
01:27 - conversion formula for that Fahrenheit
01:30 - to Celsius
01:31 - okay and second one is write a Java
01:33 - program to convert minutes into a number
01:36 - of years and days so the here in the
01:39 - input will be the minutes like here you
01:41 - can see three four five six seven eight
01:43 - nine is the minutes that the user will
01:46 - input give input to your code and the
01:48 - expected output is you have to convert
01:51 - those minutes into years and
01:53 - corresponding days okay
01:55 - so next question is write a Java program
01:58 - to compute a body mass index so what is
02:01 - body mass index you can just Google it
02:03 - out like here if I Google body
02:07 - mass index
02:09 - and I write formula okay
02:13 - so first
02:15 - you can come you can go any of this
02:18 - website
02:19 - and here you can see
02:22 - I guess yes here you can see the example
02:26 - they are given for example you have your
02:28 - weight is 68 kg height is this much so
02:30 - the calculation is this for calculating
02:32 - the BMI so you can use this formula and
02:35 - solve this problem to calculate the BMI
02:37 - of the of that person so the inputs to
02:40 - this program will be your weight and
02:43 - height and the corresponding BMI will be
02:46 - get printed on the console okay though
02:49 - so next question will be write a Java
02:51 - program to break an integer into
02:53 - sequence of individual digits
02:56 - okay so for this the input will be like
03:00 - like here you can see one two three four
03:02 - five six is given to the given as an
03:04 - input you just have to print the each
03:06 - word of that
03:08 - each digit of that number in a separated
03:11 - way like one then one space then two
03:14 - then one space one three asset like that
03:16 - okay so next moving next the fifth
03:20 - question is write a Java program that
03:21 - accepts the two integer from the user
03:23 - and then prints the sum the difference
03:25 - the product the average the distance the
03:28 - distance in the sense the difference
03:30 - between the integers okay the maximum
03:33 - the maximum means the larger of the two
03:35 - integer and the minimum minimum means a
03:37 - smaller of those two integers okay so
03:40 - for this you have to receive two inputs
03:42 - from the user first input as a first
03:44 - integer and second as a second integer
03:46 - and the expected output is the sum of
03:48 - those uh two numbers the difference
03:50 - between two numbers the product of the
03:52 - two numbers the average of those two
03:54 - numbers and the distance of the two
03:56 - integers and the maximum integer from
03:58 - those two numbers and the minimum
04:00 - integer from those two numbers
04:02 - so I hope you guys got some idea about
04:05 - these five questions give it a try try
04:08 - to solve those five question it will
04:10 - help you to understand those concepts of
04:13 - data types and variable more efficiently
04:15 - and after one or two week I'll be making
04:20 - a video in which we will be talking
04:23 - about looking into the comment section
04:24 - of this video this you put some solution
04:27 - of your Co you you put some code of your
04:31 - solution in the comment box of this
04:32 - video and I will be looking to it and
04:35 - okay
04:36 - so in the next video we will be seeing
04:38 - some solution towards this problems
04:41 - before that you should try those these
04:44 - questions and
04:46 - I hope you will try and give it a try
04:49 - and once once again I will be providing
04:52 - this
04:53 - as a PDF this notes and this all this
04:56 - question has a PDF file inside this
04:58 - GitHub repository you can just click
05:01 - here like here I have uploaded already
05:04 - you just this is the fifth video of our
05:06 - Java Series so you can click on the zero
05:08 - five resource and you will be get all
05:10 - those resources in here okay so no
05:13 - worries about that
05:14 - okay I hope you guys have enjoyed this
05:17 - video please give it a try for these
05:19 - questions and I will see you in the next
05:21 - video talking about the solution of
05:23 - these questions

Cleaned transcript:

so guys in this video I will be giving you the five coding questions here you can see and I'm expecting that you guys should give it a try and code it out these problem statements so till now if you are following this series I expect that you are you have watched all those previous videos wherein I'll be talking about the data types and variables with you guys till now so uh in considering that you have watched the previous video I have uh created this list of five coding questions wherein the only concept that is required is data types and Java variables Java variables for you to solve these coding questions okay not more than this and not any another concept that I didn't discuss in this series you don't require this okay so I will just give you a brief overview of each question uh so that that it's like a hint for you to solve these questions okay so in the first question the question is like that write a Java program to convert the temperature from a Fahrenheit to the Celsius degree okay so it's a basic simple Pro Java code you have to perform and the input is like that you given a temperature that is in Fahrenheit and the expected output from your code is that though that fahrenheit's temperature will get converted into Celsius temperature okay you can search for a search into Google for the conversion formula for that Fahrenheit to Celsius okay and second one is write a Java program to convert minutes into a number of years and days so the here in the input will be the minutes like here you can see three four five six seven eight nine is the minutes that the user will input give input to your code and the expected output is you have to convert those minutes into years and corresponding days okay so next question is write a Java program to compute a body mass index so what is body mass index you can just Google it out like here if I Google body mass index and I write formula okay so first you can come you can go any of this website and here you can see I guess yes here you can see the example they are given for example you have your weight is 68 kg height is this much so the calculation is this for calculating the BMI so you can use this formula and solve this problem to calculate the BMI of the of that person so the inputs to this program will be your weight and height and the corresponding BMI will be get printed on the console okay though so next question will be write a Java program to break an integer into sequence of individual digits okay so for this the input will be like like here you can see one two three four five six is given to the given as an input you just have to print the each word of that each digit of that number in a separated way like one then one space then two then one space one three asset like that okay so next moving next the fifth question is write a Java program that accepts the two integer from the user and then prints the sum the difference the product the average the distance the distance in the sense the difference between the integers okay the maximum the maximum means the larger of the two integer and the minimum minimum means a smaller of those two integers okay so for this you have to receive two inputs from the user first input as a first integer and second as a second integer and the expected output is the sum of those uh two numbers the difference between two numbers the product of the two numbers the average of those two numbers and the distance of the two integers and the maximum integer from those two numbers and the minimum integer from those two numbers so I hope you guys got some idea about these five questions give it a try try to solve those five question it will help you to understand those concepts of data types and variable more efficiently and after one or two week I'll be making a video in which we will be talking about looking into the comment section of this video this you put some solution of your Co you you put some code of your solution in the comment box of this video and I will be looking to it and okay so in the next video we will be seeing some solution towards this problems before that you should try those these questions and I hope you will try and give it a try and once once again I will be providing this as a PDF this notes and this all this question has a PDF file inside this GitHub repository you can just click here like here I have uploaded already you just this is the fifth video of our Java Series so you can click on the zero five resource and you will be get all those resources in here okay so no worries about that okay I hope you guys have enjoyed this video please give it a try for these questions and I will see you in the next video talking about the solution of these questions
