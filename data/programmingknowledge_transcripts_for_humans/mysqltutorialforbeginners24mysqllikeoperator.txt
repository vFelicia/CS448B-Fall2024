00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this period we will see
00:04 - what is the use of like operator and the
00:07 - file cards which often use with like
00:10 - operator so basically there are two file
00:14 - starts with like operator which are
00:17 - often used in MySQL database
00:19 - the first one is % and the second one is
00:23 - underscore sign so let us first open the
00:27 - terminal
00:33 - MySQL password
00:47 - okay so let us first see which are the
00:51 - data base that we have okay so as you
00:56 - can see we have data test data base here
00:58 - just use that and which are the tables
01:10 - that we have okay so we have two tables
01:14 - student and temp to the C which are the
01:18 - records present in stone table okay so
01:27 - these are the records present in our
01:29 - restaurant table so let us first start
01:32 - with person sign
01:35 - so basically person sign is used to find
01:38 - seni values that start with a particular
01:41 - alphabet let me show you select star
01:48 - from student wear name then like
01:59 - operator then we specify the wild card
02:04 - so I warned the records of those
02:08 - students whose name starts with M okay
02:12 - so first I use em and then the person
02:18 - sang it means that the student name must
02:22 - be starts with M and the following
02:26 - characters can be of anything okay press
02:32 - Enter as you can see we have only one
02:35 - student whose name starts with M and we
02:40 - can also use it to find any values that
02:42 - end with a particular alphabet like we
02:47 - want to find out the records whose name
02:51 - and with n okay so the percentage sign
02:56 - represent any
02:59 - were of character and then and so as you
03:05 - can see meaner and calm we have two
03:09 - students whose name ends with n ok so
03:15 - let me write another example so select
03:22 - start from student wear name like so
03:30 - what does it mean it means that I want
03:33 - to find out the records whose name
03:37 - contains I character it doesn't it it
03:43 - doesn't matter where it's appear in the
03:45 - name but the only constraint we are
03:50 - going to apply in this particular query
03:52 - is that I must be present in somewhere
03:56 - in name of the student
03:58 - ok press Enter as you can see we have
04:02 - three records I is here I use an idea ok
04:08 - so this is how you can use percentage
04:13 - while card in like operator the second
04:17 - wild card is underscore underscore
04:20 - represent only one character so while
04:24 - percentage sign represent multiple
04:27 - character so select star from student
04:31 - wear name like let's say
04:43 - we doesn't have that short name so I
04:46 - write to underscore and then provide a
04:51 - so what does it mean it means that the
04:55 - first two character can be any anything
04:59 - and the last character must be n and the
05:03 - total length of the word must be three
05:07 - because as I said earlier underscore
05:10 - represent only one character and as you
05:14 - can see only one strength whose name is
05:20 - of faileth
05:23 - we can also use the combination of
05:27 - underscore and percentage operator like
05:33 - the first character can be anything and
05:39 - say the second character must be L and
05:44 - the rest of the character can be
05:47 - anything okay
05:49 - let us see the output and as you can see
05:51 - the first character can be anything and
05:54 - the second character must be L as you
05:57 - can see the result that we have get here
06:01 - the name of this runs all have L in the
06:06 - second place and then the rest of the
06:08 - character can be anything okay
06:11 - so just close this open my skull
06:16 - workbench
06:23 - ok so these are the records let me write
06:30 - select star wrong student where let me
06:45 - select this time roll number roll number
06:51 - like okay 2 times underscore and lastly
07:02 - let's f5 so what does it mean it means
07:09 - that the length of the word that we have
07:13 - specified here must be 3 because
07:16 - underscore represent only one character
07:18 - and the last character must be 5
07:25 - as you can see 5 & 5 so this is how we
07:30 - can use while star operator with the
07:32 - like operator thanks for watching

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this period we will see what is the use of like operator and the file cards which often use with like operator so basically there are two file starts with like operator which are often used in MySQL database the first one is % and the second one is underscore sign so let us first open the terminal MySQL password okay so let us first see which are the data base that we have okay so as you can see we have data test data base here just use that and which are the tables that we have okay so we have two tables student and temp to the C which are the records present in stone table okay so these are the records present in our restaurant table so let us first start with person sign so basically person sign is used to find seni values that start with a particular alphabet let me show you select star from student wear name then like operator then we specify the wild card so I warned the records of those students whose name starts with M okay so first I use em and then the person sang it means that the student name must be starts with M and the following characters can be of anything okay press Enter as you can see we have only one student whose name starts with M and we can also use it to find any values that end with a particular alphabet like we want to find out the records whose name and with n okay so the percentage sign represent any were of character and then and so as you can see meaner and calm we have two students whose name ends with n ok so let me write another example so select start from student wear name like so what does it mean it means that I want to find out the records whose name contains I character it doesn't it it doesn't matter where it's appear in the name but the only constraint we are going to apply in this particular query is that I must be present in somewhere in name of the student ok press Enter as you can see we have three records I is here I use an idea ok so this is how you can use percentage while card in like operator the second wild card is underscore underscore represent only one character so while percentage sign represent multiple character so select star from student wear name like let's say we doesn't have that short name so I write to underscore and then provide a so what does it mean it means that the first two character can be any anything and the last character must be n and the total length of the word must be three because as I said earlier underscore represent only one character and as you can see only one strength whose name is of faileth we can also use the combination of underscore and percentage operator like the first character can be anything and say the second character must be L and the rest of the character can be anything okay let us see the output and as you can see the first character can be anything and the second character must be L as you can see the result that we have get here the name of this runs all have L in the second place and then the rest of the character can be anything okay so just close this open my skull workbench ok so these are the records let me write select star wrong student where let me select this time roll number roll number like okay 2 times underscore and lastly let's f5 so what does it mean it means that the length of the word that we have specified here must be 3 because underscore represent only one character and the last character must be 5 as you can see 5 & 5 so this is how we can use while star operator with the like operator thanks for watching
