00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - use redis on your Ubuntu operating
00:07 - system
00:08 - so let's get started so first of all
00:10 - what is redis so redis is an open source
00:13 - in memory data structure store which is
00:17 - also used as a cache or a message broker
00:23 - in various applications right so it's
00:27 - basically a key value uh pair database
00:31 - mostly I use it as a caching layer in my
00:36 - applications you can also use it as a
00:39 - message broker so let's see how we can
00:42 - install redis
00:44 - so when you go to your favorite browser
00:46 - and search for install redis
00:49 - the first link which you will see here
00:53 - will be from redis dot IO
00:55 - and here you can see the title
00:58 - installing redis so just click on that
01:02 - title and then you have this install
01:05 - redis on Linux
01:07 - link here so I'm going to click on this
01:09 - link and you have the procedure on how
01:14 - you can install redis on your Ubuntu
01:18 - operating system
01:19 - so if you want to use apt install to
01:25 - install redis then this these are the
01:27 - commands if you are installing redis on
01:30 - a Docker container you might need need
01:33 - this prerequisite to install redis
01:37 - because in some containers you have some
01:41 - minimal distributions right
01:44 - I generally prefer the second option
01:48 - which is installing redis using the snap
01:52 - package manager right so the command is
01:57 - easy snap already comes with the newest
02:00 - version of Ubuntu so you can just give
02:03 - the single command and redis will be
02:06 - installed so I'm going to copy this sudo
02:08 - snap installed redis and then open my
02:11 - terminals so to open the terminal I can
02:13 - just press Ctrl alt t on my Ubuntu
02:17 - operating system and it opens the
02:18 - terminal or you can go to the
02:20 - application and click on Terminal and
02:22 - it's going to open the terminal just
02:24 - paste the command which is sudo snap
02:27 - install redis press enter and give your
02:29 - ubuntu's password which you use to log
02:32 - into your Ubuntu operating system and
02:34 - then press enter which is going to start
02:37 - the installation
02:38 - of red is on your Ubuntu operating
02:42 - system it will be finished really fast
02:45 - so redis is installed on your Ubuntu
02:49 - operating system so once redis is
02:52 - installed using the snap command you can
02:56 - enable redis using snap itself right so
03:01 - just write sudo
03:03 - snap
03:05 - enable and then redis it's going to
03:08 - enable the redis service right now in
03:12 - order to start the redis using snap you
03:16 - can just write sudo snap
03:19 - start
03:21 - and it's going to start redis right so
03:23 - you can see red is has been started
03:26 - right if you want to stop it you can use
03:31 - stop command if you want to restart
03:34 - redis you can just use
03:37 - restart command
03:40 - and it's going to restart the redis
03:43 - service using snap right so these are
03:45 - few commands you can use to enable and
03:48 - start redis using snap because we have
03:51 - installed redis using snap on our Ubuntu
03:54 - operating system right
03:57 - so once uh redis service is running you
04:03 - can also check the status also by using
04:07 - this command sudo snap Services right so
04:12 - just give sudo snap Services it's going
04:15 - to show you all the statuses of all the
04:19 - services uh which you have installed
04:22 - using snap right so redis server is
04:26 - already here and it's enabled and
04:29 - its current status is active right
04:33 - now how to
04:35 - connect to the redis server
04:38 - so in order to connect to the redis
04:40 - server you have this command generally
04:43 - if you have installed the redis using
04:46 - apt install you would use
04:49 - redis hyphen CLI right but if you have
04:54 - installed redis using snap this command
04:57 - will not work so you can see this
04:59 - command is not recognized because
05:03 - you need to use redis dot CLI if you
05:08 - have installed redis using snap right so
05:13 - just write redis dot CLI and you are
05:16 - connected to your local redis server
05:19 - right I can just press Ctrl C in order
05:23 - to come out of the CLI if you want to
05:27 - give the same name or if you want to use
05:30 - same name right like redis hyphen CLI
05:36 - you can create an alias for
05:40 - redis.cli right so just write
05:44 - sudo snap
05:47 - Alias then
05:50 - the name of our redis clis readys.cli
05:55 - then just writes the red is hyphen CLI
05:59 - and then press enter so the Alias is
06:02 - created and now you can use
06:05 - redis hyphen CLI to connect to your
06:08 - ready server and use it like this okay
06:13 - so this is how uh you can use redis on
06:18 - your Ubuntu operating system if you are
06:21 - not happy with the Las you can also on
06:24 - Alias it by just uh giving this command
06:28 - on Alias and then give this uh give this
06:34 - The redis Hyphen CLI and it's going to
06:36 - unless it right so let me just use redis
06:41 - CLI and then when you give your ping
06:46 - command it's going to in turn give you
06:49 - the pong output
06:51 - this is how you know that redis is
06:55 - working fine right as I said redis is a
06:59 - key value
07:00 - pair database for example so you can set
07:04 - a value for any key by using the set
07:07 - command so just write set and then the
07:10 - name of your key let's say the name of
07:12 - the key is test and the value is
07:17 - my value for example right so just write
07:20 - my value and then press enter
07:23 - so we have created a key called test
07:27 - and its value is my value right in order
07:31 - to get the value of test key just write
07:34 - get and the name of the key which is
07:38 - test and it's going to give you the
07:40 - value for that key right you can just
07:43 - write exit to exit out of your red CLI
07:48 - and from now on you can
07:51 - just use Reddit CLI to interact with
07:55 - your ready server on your Ubuntu
07:57 - operating system
07:59 - so this is how you can download install
08:01 - and use redis on your Ubuntu operating
08:04 - system I hope you enjoyed this video and
08:06 - I will see you in the next video
