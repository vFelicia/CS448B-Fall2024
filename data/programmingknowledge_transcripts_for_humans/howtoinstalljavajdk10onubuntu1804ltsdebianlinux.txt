00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Java JDK 10 on your open to operating
00:07 - system so let's get started
00:09 - first of all open your terminal so you
00:12 - can just press ctrl alt T in order to
00:16 - open the terminal
00:17 - or you can go here and search for
00:20 - terminal in order to open the terminal
00:23 - so one star terminal is open the
00:26 - commands are relatively simple I have
00:29 - just written all the commands together
00:32 - and these commands I'm also going to
00:34 - paste it in the description so you can
00:37 - just copy all these commands one by one
00:40 - and then install Java JDK 10 so the
00:44 - first command is to add the PPA
00:46 - repository so I'm going to just copy the
00:48 - first command and I'm going to just
00:51 - paste it here and then press Enter which
00:54 - is going to ask for my windows password
00:56 - I'm going to give my Ubuntu's password
00:58 - and then press enter and in here it
01:00 - asked me to press ENTER to continue so
01:02 - I'm going to just press ENTER to
01:04 - continue so this is finished so let's
01:06 - copy the second command which is to
01:08 - update so sudo apt-get update and I'm
01:12 - going to just paste the second command
01:14 - and then press ENTER and this command is
01:16 - also finished so let's install Java JDK
01:19 - 10 using the last command which is sudo
01:23 - apt-get install Oracle Java 10 installer
01:26 - so I'm going to just copy and then paste
01:28 - this command and then press ENTER and
01:30 - then press Y and then press Enter
01:33 - and after some times you will see this
01:35 - message which says Oracle binary code
01:36 - License Agreement for Java SE platform
01:39 - products and Java effects so I'm going
01:41 - to just press ENTER and the second
01:45 - message is do you accept Oracle binary
01:49 - code license so I will just use my arrow
01:52 - key to come on yes and then press Enter
01:55 - so the installation of Java JDK 10 is
01:58 - finished on my system and at last you
02:00 - will see this message which says Oracle
02:02 - JDK 10 is installed and then you will
02:05 - see an important note here and this
02:08 - message says to set Oracle JDK 10 as
02:11 - default install Oracle
02:13 - Java 10 set default and the command for
02:16 - this is this one so the command is sudo
02:19 - apt-get install Oracle - Java 10 - set
02:22 - default which I have also written on
02:24 - this document so I'm going to copy this
02:27 - command from here and then I'm going to
02:29 - paste it on my terminal and then press
02:33 - Enter and then everything is finished
02:36 - now so let's check whether Java JDK is
02:40 - installed and which version of Java is
02:42 - installed on our system so for that I'm
02:45 - going to open the next terminal or the
02:48 - second terminal and in here I'm going to
02:51 - just give this command to check the
02:53 - version of Java which is Java - -
02:56 - version is going to give us the Java
02:58 - version and you can see Java 10 is the
03:01 - latest version and we can also check the
03:04 - Java C command which is used to compile
03:07 - Java code so Java C - - version and then
03:12 - press Enter it says Java C ten point
03:15 - zero point one so everything is working
03:18 - fine on your system so this is how you
03:20 - can download an install Oracle Java 10
03:22 - on your open to operating system I hope
03:24 - you've enjoyed this video please rate
