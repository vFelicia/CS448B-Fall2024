00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - Maven tutorial for beginners now first
00:05 - of all what is Maven Maven is a software
00:09 - management and comprehension tool based
00:11 - upon the concept of pal or project
00:15 - object model which can manage project
00:18 - builds reporting and documentation from
00:21 - a central piece of
00:23 - information now if you look at it all
00:26 - build systems are essentially the same
00:29 - that mean means they perform the same
00:31 - steps for making or building a project
00:35 - these steps are compiling the source
00:38 - code copying the resources compiling and
00:41 - running the tests and then packaging
00:45 - your project and then deploying your
00:47 - project and then clean up right now
00:52 - people or developers of Maven wanted a
00:56 - standard way to build the project they
01:00 - wanted a clean definition of what the
01:02 - project consist of and an easy way to
01:06 - publish project information and a way to
01:09 - share jar across several project so that
01:13 - essentially means that they wanted a
01:16 - easy way to you know build your project
01:19 - and share your project with the
01:21 - colleagues or with the clients or
01:24 - anybody else right as a result they come
01:27 - up with a tool which is called Maven
01:31 - which is for building and managing any
01:34 - Java project right now Maven is intended
01:38 - to make the day-to-day work of java
01:41 - developer easier and generally help with
01:44 - the comprehension of any Java based
01:48 - project now as I already said Maven uses
01:52 - the concept of P now what is pom now pom
01:57 - is a fundamental unit of work in Maven
02:00 - you can say a pom is an XML file that
02:05 - contains information about the project
02:08 - and configuration detailed used by Maven
02:11 - to build the project so it's like a XML
02:15 - file which contains some information and
02:17 - what can be this information this
02:20 - information describes a project in all
02:24 - and this information contains the name
02:27 - version artifact type so those code
02:30 - limitations or dependencies of a project
02:34 - it also uh retains the plug-in
02:37 - information and profiles now as I
02:41 - already said it uses XML by default but
02:45 - not in a way anunt uses XML as you know
02:49 - ant is also a built management system
02:52 - now let's see what are the important
02:54 - objectives of Maven now the first
02:57 - objective of Maven is to make the build
03:01 - process easy and to provide a uniform
03:05 - build system providing a quality project
03:09 - information providing guidelines of best
03:13 - practices development and allowing the
03:16 - transparent migration to new features
03:20 - and all these objectives and benefits of
03:23 - Maven we will see from the next video
03:25 - when we will see how we can create our
03:28 - first May project and we will see how
03:33 - bom Works in details right so stay tuned
03:37 - for the next video please rate comment
03:39 - and subscribe and bye for

hello guys welcome to the first video on Maven tutorial for beginners now first of all what is Maven Maven is a software management and comprehension tool based upon the concept of pal or project object model which can manage project builds reporting and documentation from a central piece of information now if you look at it all build systems are essentially the same that mean means they perform the same steps for making or building a project these steps are compiling the source code copying the resources compiling and running the tests and then packaging your project and then deploying your project and then clean up right now people or developers of Maven wanted a standard way to build the project they wanted a clean definition of what the project consist of and an easy way to publish project information and a way to share jar across several project so that essentially means that they wanted a easy way to you know build your project and share your project with the colleagues or with the clients or anybody else right as a result they come up with a tool which is called Maven which is for building and managing any Java project right now Maven is intended to make the daytoday work of java developer easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java based project now as I already said Maven uses the concept of P now what is pom now pom is a fundamental unit of work in Maven you can say a pom is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration detailed used by Maven to build the project so it's like a XML file which contains some information and what can be this information this information describes a project in all and this information contains the name version artifact type so those code limitations or dependencies of a project it also uh retains the plugin information and profiles now as I already said it uses XML by default but not in a way anunt uses XML as you know ant is also a built management system now let's see what are the important objectives of Maven now the first objective of Maven is to make the build process easy and to provide a uniform build system providing a quality project information providing guidelines of best practices development and allowing the transparent migration to new features and all these objectives and benefits of Maven we will see from the next video when we will see how we can create our first May project and we will see how bom Works in details right so stay tuned for the next video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for
