00:00 - hello guys there will be the next video
00:02 - on shell scripting tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:05 - we can use the if statement in our
00:08 - script now if you are familiar with any
00:12 - other programming language you may know
00:15 - that if statement can be used to
00:18 - evaluate some condition and if the
00:21 - condition is true then your you know
00:24 - code will be executed otherwise it goes
00:27 - into else condition or it's not executed
00:30 - right so let's see how we can use if
00:34 - statement in our bash script so to use
00:38 - if statement in bash script you have the
00:42 - basic skeleton like this so you write if
00:45 - and then in square bracket you write
00:49 - some conditional expression okay so I'm
00:52 - going to just write here condition and
00:56 - then you write a keyword called then and
01:01 - then you if the condition is true then
01:05 - you perform that statement and then if
01:11 - the if statement is you know done then
01:15 - you write fi for the end of this
01:18 - statement right so this is the basic
01:21 - syntax of if statement let's see how we
01:25 - can use it with some example what I'm
01:29 - going to do is I'm going to declare our
01:31 - variable let's say the variable name is
01:34 - count here okay and the value of count
01:38 - is four examples 10 okay and we want to
01:41 - evaluate this variable so what I'm going
01:46 - to do here is in the square bracket I'm
01:48 - going to just write the name of my
01:51 - variable and then there are some
01:54 - comparison operator here I can use with
01:58 - the integer so for comparison what you
02:02 - can use you can use equality or non
02:05 - equality or greater than or less than or
02:09 - greater than and equal to or less than
02:11 - equal to right so
02:13 - these are the comparison operator you
02:15 - can use so I'm going to show you the
02:17 - list which are the operator you can use
02:20 - with integer so you can see this is the
02:24 - list I have so you can use with integer
02:29 - - EQ 4 equal to minus n e4 not equal to
02:35 - then GT for greater than GE for greater
02:40 - than or equal to LP for less than and le
02:45 - for less than or equal to and if you
02:48 - want to use these angle brackets then
02:51 - you need to use doubles parentheses
02:54 - instead of this kind of square bracket
02:58 - so let's use our first comparison
03:02 - operator which is equal to right so
03:05 - after this count you just need to write
03:07 - EQ for equality and let's compare it
03:10 - with for example nine right which we
03:13 - know that this condition is not true
03:15 - because 10 is not equal to 9 right so
03:21 - what we can do here is we can echo that
03:25 - this condition is true or false right in
03:29 - our case this is not true so nothing
03:32 - will be printed right so let's run our
03:35 - code and let's see what happened so I'm
03:38 - going to run our script and prints
03:41 - nothing because 10 is not equal to 9
03:45 - right but if I just use 10 here which is
03:50 - the true condition then let's see what
03:53 - happened so it print condition is true
03:57 - right in a same way we can use all these
04:01 - expressions which I have shown you so
04:04 - for example ne4 not non equality so any
04:08 - and let's use the 9 here which is a true
04:14 - condition because 10 is not equal to and
04:17 - 9 right and once again going to show us
04:20 - condition is true okay
04:23 - and so on so if you want to use greater
04:25 - than just write GT here GT so 10 is
04:31 - greater than 9 which is true and you
04:34 - will be able to see the result once
04:36 - again right so all these operators you
04:39 - can use to evaluate your condition in
04:41 - the case of integer let's see this angle
04:45 - bracket case also so for checking
04:48 - whether this count variable is greater
04:51 - than 9 or not we can just use this kind
04:57 - of angle bracket and wherever the angle
04:59 - bracket opens it has to be a bigger
05:02 - number in order to fulfill the condition
05:05 - so let's see what what is the result of
05:07 - this script and it feels true and if you
05:13 - want to just run it with double parent
05:16 - this is also this expression you can
05:18 - just use it double parenthesis and then
05:23 - run it then it says true also right so
05:27 - this kind of expression you generally
05:29 - use with double parenthesis right and
05:32 - you have other expressions also like
05:37 - greater than or equal to or less than or
05:40 - equal to so let's see this expression
05:43 - this is also true condition so you will
05:46 - see your you know result here now for
05:49 - comparing the strings you have to use
05:53 - for equality single equal to or double
05:58 - equal to they are same and if in the
06:02 - case of non equality you can use this
06:06 - kind of exclamation marks and equal
06:10 - symbol or you have the angle bracket for
06:14 - you know checking the alphabetical order
06:17 - okay so let's say our for example we
06:21 - have the word and let's say it's ABC
06:25 - right and here we can just use the
06:29 - square bracket once again and then we
06:32 - can just write in the name of our
06:34 - variable which is word
06:36 - and then to check whether it's equal to
06:39 - whatever we are providing here so for
06:43 - example we say ABC let's check whether
06:47 - this condition is true or not right so
06:50 - let's run the script and sales condition
06:55 - is true now let's change this comparison
06:59 - for example some random keyword and you
07:03 - can see there is no result
07:05 - that means this string is not equal to
07:08 - the string which is in the board of
07:12 - variable right so for string comparison
07:16 - you use single equal to single equal to
07:19 - will also work here so for example I
07:23 - have this and single equals and then I
07:26 - run the script once again it says true
07:29 - so you can use for equality single equal
07:32 - or double equal which is they do a
07:35 - little bit weird when you compare it
07:38 - with some other languages for example C
07:41 - or C++ or Java or any other language
07:44 - they use this double equals for equality
07:47 - but in our case you can use single
07:50 - equals or W column script right now you
07:53 - can also use not equality or non
07:57 - equality for string like this so for
08:01 - example I have this string and this
08:04 - condition is also true so whenever we
08:06 - run the script
08:07 - it says condition is true okay and
08:10 - whenever you want to you know check the
08:14 - alphabetical order then also you can use
08:18 - at these angle brackets so let's say
08:20 - this is a and here we have the B right
08:27 - and let's run the script once again
08:30 - let's say what happens so it says no
08:34 - such file or directory so as we have
08:37 - seen in the case of for integers
08:40 - whenever you use these angle bracket you
08:43 - need to use double parenthesis right so
08:46 - whenever you use angle bracket with
08:48 - strings
08:49 - you need to use double square brackets
08:52 - that's why you see this error here which
08:55 - says no such file or directory right so
08:58 - you just need to use double square
09:02 - bracket with good string
09:04 - whenever you use this these kind of
09:06 - angled brackets right and let's run the
09:10 - script once again and this time
09:12 - hopefully it will run so it runs so keep
09:15 - these you know conditions in mind so
09:19 - whenever you want to use the comparison
09:23 - operator with integers you can use
09:26 - single square brackets which gives EQ on
09:29 - any on GT operations whenever you want
09:33 - to use these angle brackets on integer
09:36 - comparison you need to use the double
09:39 - parenthesis whenever you want to compare
09:43 - strings you can use single equal to or
09:46 - double equal to for equality and
09:48 - whenever you want to use angle bracket
09:51 - with strings you just need to use double
09:54 - square brackets okay now there can be
09:58 - some other conditions with if you can
10:02 - use else condition also with if so let's
10:07 - see how we can use as condition so you
10:10 - may have guessed you just need to write
10:12 - else here so just write else and then
10:15 - you can just say for example condition
10:19 - is false so if you want to use this kind
10:23 - of expression you already may have
10:25 - guessed that if the condition is true
10:27 - then it is going to go to this block
10:30 - after then before else and if the
10:33 - condition is false then it's going to go
10:36 - to the else statement and whatever is
10:39 - written between s and the end of the if
10:42 - or condition that code will be executed
10:46 - right so let's run the code once again
10:49 - and let's say we say that a is equal to
10:53 - B which is false so else condition will
10:57 - be executed right so it says condition
10:59 - is false so if the condition is not true
11:02 - then the L
11:03 - statement code will be executed right
11:06 - now there is another way you can use FL
11:10 - condition so if you want to evaluate
11:13 - multiple condition and on the base look
11:15 - for those multiple conditions you want
11:18 - to execute your code then you can use
11:21 - if/elif/else condition so for example
11:26 - I'm checking here if the variable is a
11:30 - or not so for example I can here also
11:35 - write if and then if the condition is
11:39 - true this statement will be executed
11:41 - otherwise I can also write here else if
11:45 - condition so just write L if and inside
11:50 - LF once again write them and then here
11:54 - you can also write some statements so
11:58 - for example you can just write something
12:01 - like this so whenever this condition is
12:05 - true we will print condition for example
12:08 - B is true here and then here we will
12:12 - write condition a is true and here we
12:15 - need to write some one again some
12:19 - condition to check so with LF also you
12:22 - can use these kind of conditions and
12:24 - then for example we will just say a here
12:28 - right because we are searching for a
12:31 - word is a and this will be acquainted
12:34 - right so once again run the script and
12:37 - let's see what is the result is and you
12:40 - can see condition a is true which is
12:42 - this one because our word variable is
12:45 - equal to a which is this condition right
12:48 - so if this condition is false then this
12:53 - condition will be evaluated and if it's
12:55 - true then this code will be you know
12:59 - executed otherwise the last option is
13:03 - this option in else condition so in this
13:06 - way you can use if-else condition if
13:09 - condition and LF condition in your
13:12 - script so I hope you've enjoyed this

hello guys there will be the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use the if statement in our script now if you are familiar with any other programming language you may know that if statement can be used to evaluate some condition and if the condition is true then your you know code will be executed otherwise it goes into else condition or it's not executed right so let's see how we can use if statement in our bash script so to use if statement in bash script you have the basic skeleton like this so you write if and then in square bracket you write some conditional expression okay so I'm going to just write here condition and then you write a keyword called then and then you if the condition is true then you perform that statement and then if the if statement is you know done then you write fi for the end of this statement right so this is the basic syntax of if statement let's see how we can use it with some example what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare our variable let's say the variable name is count here okay and the value of count is four examples 10 okay and we want to evaluate this variable so what I'm going to do here is in the square bracket I'm going to just write the name of my variable and then there are some comparison operator here I can use with the integer so for comparison what you can use you can use equality or non equality or greater than or less than or greater than and equal to or less than equal to right so these are the comparison operator you can use so I'm going to show you the list which are the operator you can use with integer so you can see this is the list I have so you can use with integer EQ 4 equal to minus n e4 not equal to then GT for greater than GE for greater than or equal to LP for less than and le for less than or equal to and if you want to use these angle brackets then you need to use doubles parentheses instead of this kind of square bracket so let's use our first comparison operator which is equal to right so after this count you just need to write EQ for equality and let's compare it with for example nine right which we know that this condition is not true because 10 is not equal to 9 right so what we can do here is we can echo that this condition is true or false right in our case this is not true so nothing will be printed right so let's run our code and let's see what happened so I'm going to run our script and prints nothing because 10 is not equal to 9 right but if I just use 10 here which is the true condition then let's see what happened so it print condition is true right in a same way we can use all these expressions which I have shown you so for example ne4 not non equality so any and let's use the 9 here which is a true condition because 10 is not equal to and 9 right and once again going to show us condition is true okay and so on so if you want to use greater than just write GT here GT so 10 is greater than 9 which is true and you will be able to see the result once again right so all these operators you can use to evaluate your condition in the case of integer let's see this angle bracket case also so for checking whether this count variable is greater than 9 or not we can just use this kind of angle bracket and wherever the angle bracket opens it has to be a bigger number in order to fulfill the condition so let's see what what is the result of this script and it feels true and if you want to just run it with double parent this is also this expression you can just use it double parenthesis and then run it then it says true also right so this kind of expression you generally use with double parenthesis right and you have other expressions also like greater than or equal to or less than or equal to so let's see this expression this is also true condition so you will see your you know result here now for comparing the strings you have to use for equality single equal to or double equal to they are same and if in the case of non equality you can use this kind of exclamation marks and equal symbol or you have the angle bracket for you know checking the alphabetical order okay so let's say our for example we have the word and let's say it's ABC right and here we can just use the square bracket once again and then we can just write in the name of our variable which is word and then to check whether it's equal to whatever we are providing here so for example we say ABC let's check whether this condition is true or not right so let's run the script and sales condition is true now let's change this comparison for example some random keyword and you can see there is no result that means this string is not equal to the string which is in the board of variable right so for string comparison you use single equal to single equal to will also work here so for example I have this and single equals and then I run the script once again it says true so you can use for equality single equal or double equal which is they do a little bit weird when you compare it with some other languages for example C or C++ or Java or any other language they use this double equals for equality but in our case you can use single equals or W column script right now you can also use not equality or non equality for string like this so for example I have this string and this condition is also true so whenever we run the script it says condition is true okay and whenever you want to you know check the alphabetical order then also you can use at these angle brackets so let's say this is a and here we have the B right and let's run the script once again let's say what happens so it says no such file or directory so as we have seen in the case of for integers whenever you use these angle bracket you need to use double parenthesis right so whenever you use angle bracket with strings you need to use double square brackets that's why you see this error here which says no such file or directory right so you just need to use double square bracket with good string whenever you use this these kind of angled brackets right and let's run the script once again and this time hopefully it will run so it runs so keep these you know conditions in mind so whenever you want to use the comparison operator with integers you can use single square brackets which gives EQ on any on GT operations whenever you want to use these angle brackets on integer comparison you need to use the double parenthesis whenever you want to compare strings you can use single equal to or double equal to for equality and whenever you want to use angle bracket with strings you just need to use double square brackets okay now there can be some other conditions with if you can use else condition also with if so let's see how we can use as condition so you may have guessed you just need to write else here so just write else and then you can just say for example condition is false so if you want to

to the else statement and whatever is written between s and the end of the if or condition that code will be executed right so let's run the code once again and let's say we say that a is equal to B which is false so else condition will be executed right so it says condition is false so if the condition is not true then the L statement code will be executed right now there is another way you can use FL condition so if you want to evaluate multiple condition and on the base look for those multiple conditions you want to execute your code then you can use if/elif/else condition so for example I'm checking here if the variable is a or not so for example I can here also write if and then if the condition is true this statement will be executed otherwise I can also write here else if

these kind of conditions and then for example we will just say a here right because we are searching for a word is a and this will be acquainted right so once again run the script and let's see what is the result is and you can see condition a is true which is this one because our word variable is equal to a which is this condition right so if this condition is false then this condition will be evaluated and if it's true then this code will be you know executed otherwise the last option is this option in else condition so in this way you can use ifelse condition if condition and LF condition in your script so I hope you've enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye
