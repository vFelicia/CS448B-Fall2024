00:08 - your Visual Basic windows from
00:10 - application project and I have also
00:12 - shown you how you can bind your data
00:15 - base with this datag grid View and how
00:17 - you can generate
00:19 - these text boxes and checkboxes along
00:23 - with these uh tool widgets right now in

01:24 - buttons and
01:26 - now what we can do is
01:30 - we can double click the these buttons
01:33 - and uh write the code but first of all
01:36 - you may have noticed when you have
01:38 - connected your uh uh form with your
01:41 - access database by dragging and dropping
01:44 - this data employee data or whatever
01:47 - database you have to your form it will
01:50 - generate these uh tools here which
01:54 - are data set whatever database you have
01:57 - do data set employee. binding Source
02:00 - employee data table adopter table
02:02 - adopter manager and binding
02:06 - Navigator okay so just remember these
02:08 - name we are going to use these names
02:10 - here and first of all we will use this
02:13 - add new button and uh we will just
02:18 - double click this button and in here we
02:20 - will write the code so we will write in
02:23 - case of the whatever your database name
02:27 - is just write the name of your database
02:30 - so my database name
02:32 - is employee database and just search for
02:36 - whatever binding source of that database
02:39 - so you will be able to find in my case
02:42 - employee data binding Source whatever
02:44 - your datab base name is but and after
02:47 - that binding Source uh you need to
02:50 - search or you need to just look here
02:53 - whatever is The Binding Source before
02:56 - your database name okay so so data
03:02 - employee data binding Source dot add new
03:09 - okay once again go to the save button
03:12 - and double click it and in here you need
03:15 - to write first of all we will add a TR
03:19 - cage block so just
03:24 - write
03:26 - sorry okay so we will write try and
03:29 - press enter it will give us this try
03:32 - catch code and what this try catch does
03:35 - is if any error occurs while you uh uh
03:40 - save your data it will catch the
03:43 - exception and show you some message
03:45 - whatever message you want to show
03:47 - otherwise it will save the data so in
03:50 - case of error condition it this try
