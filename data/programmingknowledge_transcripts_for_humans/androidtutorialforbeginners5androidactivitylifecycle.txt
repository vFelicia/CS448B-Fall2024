00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - an overview of Android activity life
00:12 - cycle so in the last video I have shown
00:15 - you uh that whenever you go inside this
00:18 - Java folder in your app and when you
00:21 - click this main activity this is the
00:24 - main brain or main logic of your Android
00:28 - activity application
00:30 - and this is a Java class which inherits
00:34 - from activity class but when you take a
00:39 - look at this uh here extend means uh
00:43 - inheriting from this class right but you
00:46 - don't see that it's inheriting from the
00:50 - activity class it's inheriting from
00:52 - action bar
00:53 - activity so it's like a multiple
00:56 - inheritance and at the last the base
00:59 - class or super class here is the
01:02 - activity class so to demonstrate this
01:05 - this main activity is inheriting
01:07 - indirectly from activity class what you
01:11 - can do is you can just control just
01:14 - press control Plus or control and hover
01:17 - over this action bar activity and click
01:20 - it and you will reach to the action bar
01:23 - activity and you can see the action bar
01:26 - activity is inheriting from this class
01:29 - which is
01:30 - fragment action so you can just control
01:34 - just press control and hover over this
01:35 - frag fragment action and click it and
01:39 - now you can see this fragment action
01:41 - extends from
01:43 - activity so indirectly your main
01:47 - activity is inheriting from activity
01:51 - class
01:52 - right so
01:55 - now
01:57 - every activity has its life cycle for
02:01 - example when your program or activity
02:06 - launches first method it uh you know
02:10 - looks for or it uh calls is this method
02:14 - which is on create method and we are
02:17 - just overriding uh this method from the
02:21 - class we are inheriting from right so
02:25 - here we are calling it and the first
02:29 - thing when we start our application is
02:33 - we want to launch the layout or set the
02:37 - view of the layout layout is just this
02:40 - design right so the first method which
02:44 - will be called here is the oncreate
02:48 - method in the same uh
02:51 - way here you can call different method
02:54 - for example whenever you run your
02:57 - Android app you can uh you know you can
03:00 - user can uh resume this and you he can
03:03 - go to some other you know Android app
03:08 - for example this Android app
03:10 - and the other Android app which was our
03:14 - actual app was running in the background
03:18 - because it's not closed but it's running
03:20 - in the background but uh you can close
03:23 - this app also
03:26 - by you know going back and close it
03:30 - so there are some method are which are
03:34 - called when you do these all actions
03:38 - when you go uh to your uh menu here you
03:42 - can call your app by clicking you know
03:46 - on the app and it'll open like this
03:49 - right so when you click this uh uh app
03:53 - icon or when you uh you know do some
03:56 - other cool things with your application
03:59 - what are the method which are called uh
04:03 - this you can write here and the overview
04:06 - of these method you can see on Android
04:12 - uh you know website in the documentation
04:15 - this link I'm going to uh give you in
04:17 - the description of this video so you can
04:20 - uh go to uh this documentation this is
04:23 - really extensive documentation and here
04:26 - you will see a
04:28 - diagram which will demonstrate the basic
04:33 - life cycle of an activity so this is uh
04:38 - this is the same uh you know picture uh
04:41 - as this and what happens when you launch
04:45 - your application first method which is
04:47 - called as I have told you is oncreate
04:50 - and this oncreate method calls this set
04:55 - content view which uh sets the layout
04:58 - for you for the activity
05:00 - right then if you uh add this method or
05:05 - overwrite this method on
05:07 - start this uh
05:10 - method is called when your activity
05:13 - starts okay so after creating your uh
05:17 - act uh layout you can call this method
05:20 - so this method is called so this is the
05:22 - you know
05:24 - chronological life cycle of your
05:27 - activity so these are the method me
05:29 - which are called one by one if you you
05:33 - know add this method in your Java uh
05:37 - file main activity Java file then you
05:41 - can you know resume this application or
05:44 - pause this application right and in
05:47 - between this application runs okay so
05:51 - these are the chronological uh you know
05:54 - uh order of these function which can be
05:56 - called by your activity so resume then
06:00 - activity is running then if you want to
06:04 - uh you know call another activity for
06:06 - example you are on the homepage of your
06:09 - uh application and you want to see the
06:11 - about uh page of your application uh you
06:16 - go or you click some button and then
06:18 - this activity which is running is paused
06:23 - and then your new activity uh you know
06:27 - going is going to start okay and then if
06:31 - you unpause this the activity is no
06:33 - longer visible and uh stop okay and uh
06:37 - whenever you uh shut down or you know
06:41 - you close your application it destroys
06:43 - your activity and shut such shuts down
06:48 - right so you can go to this um page and
06:54 - you can read about these activity and
06:57 - these functions what every function
07:00 - means but I'm going to give you uh a
07:04 - example how they are called in this uh
07:09 - chronological order so that we have the
07:12 - better understanding which method is
07:14 - called when when we uh you know launch
07:18 - our application here okay so that's it
07:23 - for uh this video in the next video I'm
07:25 - going to give you this example of uh
07:29 - calling all these method one by one and
07:32 - we will see uh how they are called
07:35 - whenever we launch our activity so I
07:38 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see an overview of Android activity life cycle so in the last video I have shown you uh that whenever you go inside this Java folder in your app and when you click this main activity this is the main brain or main logic of your Android activity application and this is a Java class which inherits from activity class but when you take a look at this uh here extend means uh inheriting from this class right but you don't see that it's inheriting from the activity class it's inheriting from action bar activity so it's like a multiple inheritance and at the last the base class or super class here is the activity class so to demonstrate this this main activity is inheriting indirectly from activity class what you can do is you can just control just press control Plus or control and hover over this action bar activity and click it and you will reach to the action bar activity and you can see the action bar activity is inheriting from this class which is fragment action so you can just control just press control and hover over this frag fragment action and click it and now you can see this fragment action extends from activity so indirectly your main activity is inheriting from activity class right so now every activity has its life cycle for example when your program or activity launches first method it uh you know looks for or it uh calls is this method which is on create method and we are just overriding uh this method from the class we are inheriting from right so here we are calling it and the first thing when we start our application is we want to launch the layout or set the view of the layout layout is just this design right so the first method which will be called here is the oncreate method in the same uh way here you can call different method for example whenever you run your Android app you can uh you know you can user can uh resume this and you he can go to some other you know Android app for example this Android app and the other Android app which was our actual app was running in the background because it's not closed but it's running in the background but uh you can close this app also by you know going back and close it so there are some method are which are called when you do these all actions when you go uh to your uh menu here you can call your app by clicking you know on the app and it'll open like this right so when you click this uh uh app icon or when you uh you know do some other cool things with your application what are the method which are called uh this you can write here and the overview of these method you can see on Android uh you know website in the documentation this link I'm going to uh give you in the description of this video so you can uh go to uh this documentation this is really extensive documentation and here you will see a diagram which will demonstrate the basic life cycle of an activity so this is uh this is the same uh you know picture uh as this and what happens when you launch your application first method which is called as I have told you is oncreate and this oncreate method calls this set content view which uh sets the layout for you for the activity right then if you uh add this method or overwrite this method on start this uh method is called when your activity starts okay so after creating your uh act uh layout you can call this method so this method is called so this is the you know chronological life cycle of your activity so these are the method me which are called one by one if you you know add this method in your Java uh file main activity Java file then you can you know resume this application or pause this application right and in between this application runs okay so these are the chronological uh you know uh order of these function which can be called by your activity so resume then activity is running then if you want to uh you know call another activity for example you are on the homepage of your uh application and you want to see the about uh page of your application uh you go or you click some button and then this activity which is running is paused and then your new activity uh you know going is going to start okay and then if you unpause this the activity is no longer visible and uh stop okay and uh whenever you uh shut down or you know you close your application it destroys your activity and shut such shuts down right so you can go to this um page and you can read about these activity and these functions what every function means but I'm going to give you uh a example how they are called in this uh chronological order so that we have the better understanding which method is called when when we uh you know launch our application here okay so that's it for uh this video in the next video I'm going to give you this example of uh calling all these method one by one and we will see uh how they are called whenever we launch our activity so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wrate comment and subscribe and
