00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to use list iterators in
00:12 - Java so Java has basically four main
00:18 - list iterators which we can use with
00:21 - array list or other uh classes and these
00:26 - list iterators are these four
00:30 - first is has next next which Returns the
00:35 - Boolean value so it checks whether our
00:39 - list has next value and if it has the
00:43 - next value we can print the next value
00:46 - or we can access the next value by the
00:49 - function called
00:50 - Next and
00:53 - similarly by using has previous IT
00:57 - checks whether our list has a previous
01:01 - value related to the current value or
01:06 - relative to the current value and if H
01:09 - it has the previous value then we can
01:11 - print or access this uh value using
01:16 - previous so let's uh declare an array
01:21 - list
01:23 - array
01:24 - list and
01:27 - we make it the uh the array list of
01:31 - names so we uh make it
01:35 - string string and our array list uh
01:40 - variable name we will name as names is
01:44 - equal to
01:46 - new array
01:50 - list and this will be string
01:56 - also and we will initialize it as a
02:00 - default Constructor okay so now we can
02:05 - add to this uh array list some names
02:09 - names dot
02:15 - add names.
02:19 - add and we can add some values for
02:23 - example
02:26 - Mark and in a in the similar way we can
02:29 - add some more values right so I will
02:33 - copy it and paste it three or four
02:38 - times second name is for example Tom
02:42 - third name
02:45 - is
02:50 - John
02:51 - check
02:54 - and petrick for example so we have added
02:57 - five elements to our array
03:01 - list now to uh use these uh list
03:06 - iterator function we need to use list
03:10 - iterator so we will
03:13 - Define list iterator
03:18 - okay so list iterator and we want to
03:23 - have the list iterator of string same as
03:27 - your AR list so give the data type
03:30 - same as your array list and then
03:33 - give a variable name for example
03:37 - ITR is equal to and then take the list
03:43 - itself dot list iterator okay
03:49 - with small L okay so now this creates an
03:55 - iterator for your list and using this
03:58 - iterator you can check whether you uh
04:03 - can you have the next value or the
04:05 - previous value in your list so you can
04:09 - do something like
04:11 - this
04:15 - while your iterator has next value so
04:20 - ITR dot has next then we are going to
04:26 - print something so
04:28 - sis or control shift and we will print
04:34 - ITR dot
04:37 - next okay so what this is going to do it
04:41 - will check first if our iterator has or
04:47 - if our iterator has the next value or so
04:52 - this points to the for example first
04:55 - element of the list and then it checks
04:58 - if the lit iterator has the next value
05:02 - which is Tom and if it has it prints the
05:06 - next value or it uh we can access the
05:08 - next value by the function called next
05:11 - so this has next returns Boolean so it
05:16 - uh returns true or false and this
05:19 - Returns the object itself so when we run
05:21 - the program we can iterate over the list
05:25 - and print the list in this format
05:28 - okay similarly you can check or you can
05:33 - iterate over the list in the reverse
05:36 - order okay so what I'm going to do is
05:40 - I'm going
05:41 - to give some line
05:43 - break
05:45 - to
05:48 - our console here so that we can iterate
05:53 - over the list in reverse order so let's
05:56 - uh use while once
06:01 - again while and then this time we will
06:05 - use this iterator to iterate over the
06:08 - list in reverse order right so ITR dot
06:14 - has previous so search for has previous
06:18 - or just copy this has pre previous from
06:22 - here and then if we have or iterator
06:26 - have the previous value we are going to
06:28 - print the
06:29 - previous values so we can just write
06:33 - iterator
06:35 - dot previous okay so once we run the
06:40 - program we can see or we can print the
06:44 - value of the list in reverse order from
06:47 - Patrick to Mark right Patrick to Mark
06:50 - and above it has printed from Mark to
06:53 - Patrick which is in
06:55 - the uh normal order right so when
06:59 - whenever you check iterator with has
07:03 - next your pointer or you you will start
07:08 - from the top or and whenever you uh use
07:13 - has previous your pointer will start
07:16 - from the last value and it checks the
07:19 - previous value and until and unless it
07:22 - has or your iterator finds the previous
07:25 - value it will print the previous value
07:27 - Okay so
07:29 - these are some useful list iterator
07:33 - methods in Java I hope you will use them
07:36 - in your programming and I hope you have
07:38 - enjoyed this video please RIT comment

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see how to use list iterators in Java so Java has basically four main list iterators which we can use with array list or other uh classes and these list iterators are these four first is has next next which Returns the Boolean value so it checks whether our list has next value and if it has the next value we can print the next value or we can access the next value by the function called Next and similarly by using has previous IT checks whether our list has a previous value related to the current value or relative to the current value and if H it has the previous value then we can print or access this uh value using previous so let's uh declare an array list array list and we make it the uh the array list of names so we uh make it string string and our array list uh variable name we will name as names is equal to new array list and this will be string also and we will initialize it as a default Constructor okay so now we can add to this uh array list some names names dot add names. add and we can add some values for example Mark and in a in the similar way we can add some more values right so I will copy it and paste it three or four times second name is for example Tom third name is John check and petrick for example so we have added five elements to our array list now to uh use these uh list iterator function we need to use list iterator so we will Define list iterator okay so list iterator and we want to have the list iterator of string same as your AR list so give the data type same as your array list and then give a variable name for example ITR is equal to and then take the list itself dot list iterator okay with small L okay so now this creates an iterator for your list and using this iterator you can check whether you uh can you have the next value or the previous value in your list so you can do something like this while your iterator has next value so ITR dot has next then we are going to print something so sis or control shift and we will print ITR dot next okay so what this is going to do it will check first if our iterator has or if our iterator has the next value or so this points to the for example first element of the list and then it checks if the lit iterator has the next value which is Tom and if it has it prints the next value or it uh we can access the next value by the function called next so this has next returns Boolean so it uh returns true or false and this Returns the object itself so when we run the program we can iterate over the list and print the list in this format okay similarly you can check or you can iterate over the list in the reverse order okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give some line break to our console here so that we can iterate over the list in reverse order so let's uh use while once again while and then this time we will use this iterator to iterate over the list in reverse order right so ITR dot has previous so search for has previous or just copy this has pre previous from here and then if we have or iterator have the previous value we are going to print the previous values so we can just write iterator dot previous okay so once we run the program we can see or we can print the value of the list in reverse order from Patrick to Mark right Patrick to Mark and above it has printed from Mark to Patrick which is in the uh normal order right so when whenever you check iterator with has next your pointer or you you will start from the top or and whenever you uh use has previous your pointer will start from the last value and it checks the previous value and until and unless it has or your iterator finds the previous value it will print the previous value Okay so these are some useful list iterator methods in Java I hope you will use them in your programming and I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for now
