00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can use your Visual Studio
00:04 - code to query your post gray SQL Server
00:08 - so let's get started so first of all
00:10 - open the extensions section in Visual
00:13 - Studio code and search for the extension
00:15 - called SQL tools and the first result
00:20 - most probably which will appear here
00:21 - will be this one which is for SQL
00:25 - tools now this extension works with many
00:29 - other s SQL based database systems like
00:33 - MySQL postr SQL Microsoft SQL Server so
00:37 - the full list of supported database
00:40 - systems you will be able to see in the
00:43 - read me section of uh this extension so
00:47 - first of all click on install which is
00:49 - going to install this
00:51 - extension now once this extension is
00:53 - installed there is a new icon which will
00:57 - appear here on the left hand bar R which
01:00 - is for SQL tools so I'm going to click
01:02 - on this uh icon here and let me close
01:06 - this uh extension and then I can click
01:09 - on new connection to create a new
01:13 - connection now in order to connect to
01:16 - the post gray SQL or any other database
01:19 - system this SQL tool extension requires
01:22 - the desired driver extension for that
01:27 - database system so in our case we will
01:29 - will be connecting the post gr SQL right
01:32 - so we need the driver extension which is
01:36 - for post G SQL so once again go to the
01:39 - extensions and then once again search
01:42 - for SQL tools and under SQL tools you
01:46 - will be able to see more options which
01:48 - are related to SQL tools so for example
01:51 - SQL tool for MySQL Maria DB SQL tools
01:56 - for uh sqlite and we can also o see the
02:00 - SQL tools for postc SQL which is the
02:03 - required driver we need to connect to
02:05 - the SQL Server so just install this
02:08 - extension also if you're using any other
02:11 - database then you need to install the
02:14 - required driver for that database which
02:17 - is related to SQL tools so once this uh
02:21 - is installed we can once again click on
02:24 - SQL tools option here and now when I
02:26 - click on add new connection I can see
02:29 - these two options I will click on post
02:32 - gr SQL here and then I need to provide
02:35 - the configuration of my post gray SQL
02:39 - Server so that I can connect to my post
02:42 - cray so here the connection name you can
02:46 - uh give any name here I'm using the post
02:49 - CR locally so I'm going to just uh name
02:52 - my connection as PG local here and then
02:56 - you can also provide a connection group
02:58 - I'm going to leave it as default
03:00 - now you can connect via the server and
03:03 - Port socket file or connection string
03:07 - I'm going to use the first option which
03:09 - is server and the port and then you need
03:12 - to provide the server address if you are
03:15 - running your postgre SQL locally just
03:18 - leave it as Local Host if you're running
03:20 - your post gr SQL server on some remote
03:23 - machine then provide the proper IP
03:26 - address of that machine and then the
03:29 - post Port the default port for
03:31 - connecting to the post SQL Server is
03:35 - 5432 if you are using some different
03:38 - port for your MySQL server just provide
03:41 - that
03:42 - here now in order to connect to your
03:44 - postre SQL Server you need to provide
03:47 - the name of the database which already
03:49 - pre-exist in your MySQL server so let's
03:53 - say I have this database which is called
03:55 - demo which I have already created in my
03:58 - MySQL server so I need to provide the
04:00 - database name I want to connect to so
04:04 - here you need to provide the username
04:06 - which you use to connect to your MySQL
04:08 - server generally uh if you have
04:11 - installed postra freshly then the
04:13 - username will be postrace but it can be
04:16 - different also which depends on the
04:19 - settings of your post G SQL
04:21 - Server now here in the password section
04:24 - you have few different options like uh
04:27 - ask on connect use empty password and
04:30 - then you have save as plain text in
04:32 - settings so I'm going to use the last
04:34 - option which is going to save my
04:37 - password as the empty setting just for
04:40 - the Simplicity but if you are concerned
04:43 - about the security then I will ask you
04:47 - to use uh the first option or the second
04:50 - option here so I'm going to choose the
04:53 - last option which is save as plain text
04:55 - in settings because I have my post
04:58 - server running on my local machine so my
05:01 - password is really simple here and then
05:05 - when I move down a little it says node
05:08 - PG driver specific option if you're
05:11 - using SSL then you can uh enable the SSL
05:15 - from here also you will be able to see
05:17 - these multiple options like query
05:20 - timeout statement timeout connection
05:22 - timeout if you want to give these uh uh
05:26 - settings then you can give all these
05:28 - settings from here I'm going to leave
05:30 - everything as default and then you have
05:33 - this connection timeout option so I'm
05:35 - going to give this connection time out
05:37 - as 30 here and now I have given all the
05:41 - required configurations so here I have
05:43 - the option to save my connection but
05:45 - before that we can also test our
05:47 - connection by clicking on the test
05:49 - connection button so when I click on the
05:51 - test connection button I can see
05:53 - successfully connected that means my
05:55 - connection works so I can click on Save
05:58 - connection now as you can see the list
06:00 - of connection will be listed here and
06:03 - your configuration in the form of Json
06:07 - is listed here so you can see my
06:09 - password for my local post gr is root
06:13 - and uh all the other configuration is
06:15 - listed here now in order to connect to
06:18 - your postra server you can just click on
06:21 - connect now or you can click on this
06:24 - icon here which is for connect you can
06:26 - also see the query history which we are
06:28 - going to see little bit later when we
06:30 - provide some queries here so I'm going
06:33 - to click on this connect icon here which
06:35 - is going to connect to my post SQL
06:38 - database and it's going to give me this
06:41 - kind of interface where I can run
06:43 - queries on my database I can also expand
06:47 - this connection where I will be able to
06:48 - see my database which is a demo and then
06:52 - if I have some uh tables I will be able
06:55 - to see the list of tables here so I
06:58 - already have one table here which is for
07:02 - the names if I want to create new tables
07:05 - I can provide the query to create those
07:08 - tables so let's say I want to create a
07:09 - new table here in addition to the names
07:12 - table so I can uh provide this query
07:15 - which is create table if not exist the
07:18 - table name will be users and it has
07:20 - three columns ID username and email the
07:25 - ID is the primary key here now in order
07:27 - to run this query you can can click on
07:30 - run on active connection and once I uh
07:33 - click on this it's going to show me this
07:36 - kind of uh tab here which is for my
07:39 - query and then when I refresh uh this
07:42 - connection here so I'm going to click on
07:43 - refresh here then I can see my users
07:47 - table and then I can also see that I
07:50 - have these three columns in my table
07:54 - right now if I want to see the content
07:57 - of this table I can right click on this
07:59 - uh table and then click on show table
08:01 - record right now I don't have anything
08:04 - so I can see the blank uh table here but
08:07 - once I have some data in this table I
08:10 - will be able to see the records so now
08:13 - let's insert some data into the table so
08:16 - I'm going to provide this query for
08:18 - inserting the data into my post crit
08:20 - table which is insert into users user
08:23 - name comma email and then I am going to
08:27 - add these three row in my table now if
08:31 - you want to uh run a particular query
08:34 - and not the whole SQL script then you
08:38 - can select your query here and then
08:40 - right click on your query and then you
08:42 - have this option which says run selected
08:44 - query here and it's going to run your
08:48 - selected query and once that's
08:50 - successful I can once again right click
08:54 - on the users table and then click on
08:56 - show table records and now I I can see
08:59 - three records here which are added to my
09:02 - table
09:04 - right so this is uh the SQL session
09:08 - which you can save uh for the later
09:11 - references also you can see all the
09:14 - queries which are executed in the query
09:18 - history here now let's say I want to
09:21 - select the record via the query and not
09:24 - by right clicking on this table I can do
09:27 - that also so let's say when I type some
09:30 - query here let's say SE this extension
09:33 - is going to give me the options for the
09:35 - auto complete for example select
09:38 - srix from users and then I can once
09:43 - again select this and then right click
09:45 - and then click on run selected query and
09:48 - it's going to show me the table
09:51 - records now if you want to see details
09:55 - about your table or database you can
09:57 - once again right click on your your uh
10:00 - table or the database and then you have
10:02 - the option to describe your table it's
10:06 - going to describe what are the columns
10:08 - which are available in your table and
10:11 - what are their data types and uh other
10:14 - constraints about your columns you can
10:18 - also add a new insert query so just go
10:22 - to the end of your SQL script and then
10:25 - right click on your table and then you
10:27 - can click on generate ins insert query
10:30 - is going to give you the sample insert
10:33 - query for you so as I mentioned ID is
10:38 - not required in my table which Auto
10:41 - increments so I'm going to remove that
10:43 - but I can change the values for the
10:47 - username and email right so let's say a
10:50 - username I'm going to leave it as
10:52 - default and email let's say I'm going to
10:55 - say email atate gmail.com
10:59 - and then I can once again execute this
11:02 - uh query you know the drill and once I
11:06 - do that the data is inserted and I can
11:11 - see the new data here like this which is
11:14 - the fourth row now let's say you want to
11:16 - change the configuration of your SQL
11:18 - connection let's say your Port has
11:20 - changed and you want to change the SQL
11:23 - connection just so just right click on
11:25 - your connection here and then click on
11:26 - edit connection and you will will be
11:29 - able to edit your connection you also
11:31 - have the option to delete your
11:33 - connection or you also have the option
11:36 - to disconnect from your current
11:39 - connection right so when I click on
11:42 - disconnect it's disconnected and now I'm
11:45 - no longer connected to my post csql
11:47 - server but the configuration is there so
11:50 - let's say at the later point when you
11:53 - want this connection once again click on
11:54 - connect and it will connect once again
11:57 - this is how you can
11:59 - use Visual Studio code to connect to
12:02 - your postc SQL Server then query your
12:04 - postc SQL server using visual studio
12:07 - code that's it for this video I hope
12:09 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
12:11 - you in the next video

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can use your Visual Studio code to query your post gray SQL Server so let's get started so first of all open the extensions section in Visual Studio code and search for the extension called SQL tools and the first result most probably which will appear here will be this one which is for SQL tools now this extension works with many other s SQL based database systems like MySQL postr SQL Microsoft SQL Server so the full list of supported database systems you will be able to see in the read me section of uh this extension so first of all click on install which is going to install this extension now once this extension is installed there is a new icon which will appear here on the left hand bar R which is for SQL tools so I'm going to click on this uh icon here and let me close this uh extension and then I can click on new connection to create a new connection now in order to connect to the post gray SQL or any other database system this SQL tool extension requires the desired driver extension for that database system so in our case we will will be connecting the post gr SQL right so we need the driver extension which is for post G SQL so once again go to the extensions and then once again search for SQL tools and under SQL tools you will be able to see more options which are related to SQL tools so for example SQL tool for MySQL Maria DB SQL tools for uh sqlite and we can also o see the SQL tools for postc SQL which is the required driver we need to connect to the SQL Server so just install this extension also if you're using any other database then you need to install the required driver for that database which is related to SQL tools so once this uh is installed we can once again click on SQL tools option here and now when I click on add new connection I can see these two options I will click on post gr SQL here and then I need to provide the configuration of my post gray SQL Server so that I can connect to my post cray so here the connection name you can uh give any name here I'm using the post CR locally so I'm going to just uh name my connection as PG local here and then you can also provide a connection group I'm going to leave it as default now you can connect via the server and Port socket file or connection string I'm going to use the first option which is server and the port and then you need to provide the server address if you are running your postgre SQL locally just leave it as Local Host if you're running your post gr SQL server on some remote machine then provide the proper IP address of that machine and then the post Port the default port for connecting to the post SQL Server is 5432 if you are using some different port for your MySQL server just provide that here now in order to connect to your postre SQL Server you need to provide the name of the database which already preexist in your MySQL server so let's say I have this database which is called demo which I have already created in my MySQL server so I need to provide the database name I want to connect to so here you need to provide the username which you use to connect to your MySQL server generally uh if you have installed postra freshly then the username will be postrace but it can be different also which depends on the settings of your post G SQL Server now here in the password section you have few different options like uh ask on connect use empty password and then you have save as plain text in settings so I'm going to use the last option which is going to save my password as the empty setting just for the Simplicity but if you are concerned about the security then I will ask you to use uh the first option or the second option here so I'm going to choose the last option which is save as plain text in settings because I have my post server running on my local machine so my password is really simple here and then when I move down a little it says node PG driver specific option if you're using SSL then you can uh enable the SSL from here also you will be able to see these multiple options like query timeout statement timeout connection timeout if you want to give these uh uh settings then you can give all these settings from here I'm going to leave everything as default and then you have this connection timeout option so I'm going to give this connection time out as 30 here and now I have given all the required configurations so here I have the option to save my connection but before that we can also test our connection by clicking on the test connection button so when I click on the test connection button I can see successfully connected that means my connection works so I can click on Save connection now as you can see the list of connection will be listed here and your configuration in the form of Json is listed here so you can see my password for my local post gr is root and uh all the other configuration is listed here now in order to connect to your postra server you can just click on connect now or you can click on this icon here which is for connect you can also see the query history which we are going to see little bit later when we provide some queries here so I'm going to click on this connect icon here which is going to connect to my post SQL database and it's going to give me this kind of interface where I can run queries on my database I can also expand this connection where I will be able to see my database which is a demo and then if I have some uh tables I will be able to see the list of tables here so I already have one table here which is for the names if I want to create new tables I can provide the query to create those tables so let's say I want to create a new table here in addition to the names table so I can uh provide this query which is create table if not exist the table name will be users and it has three columns ID username and email the ID is the primary key here now in order to run this query you can can click on run on active connection and once I uh click on this it's going to show me this kind of uh tab here which is for my query and then when I refresh uh this connection here so I'm going to click on refresh here then I can see my users table and then I can also see that I have these three columns in my table right now if I want to see the content of this table I can right click on this uh table and then click on show table record right now I don't have anything so I can see the blank uh table here but once I have some data in this table I will be able to see the records so now let's insert some data into the table so I'm going to provide this query for inserting the data into my post crit table which is insert into users user name comma email and then I am going to add these three row in my table now if you want to uh run a particular query and not the whole SQL script then you can select your query here and then right click on your query and then you have this option which says run selected query here and it's going to run your selected query and once that's successful I can once again right click on the users table and then click on show table records and now I I can see three records here which are added to my table right so this is uh the SQL session which you can save uh for the later references also you can see all the queries which are executed in the query history here now let's say I want to select the record via the query and not by right clicking on this table I can do that also so let's say when I type some query here let's say SE this extension is going to give me the options for the auto complete for example select srix from users and then I can once again select this and then right click and then click on run selected query and it's going to show me the table records now if you want to see details about your table or database you can once again right click on your your uh table or the database and then you have the option to describe your table it's going to describe what are the columns which are available in your table and what are their data types and uh other constraints about your columns you can also add a new insert query so just go to the end of your SQL script and then right click on your table and then you can click on generate ins insert query is going to give you the sample insert query for you so as I mentioned ID is not required in my table which Auto increments so I'm going to remove that but I can change the values for the username and email right so let's say a username I'm going to leave it as default and email let's say I'm going to say email atate gmail.com and then I can once again execute this uh query you know the drill and once I do that the data is inserted and I can see the new data here like this which is the fourth row now let's say you want to change the configuration of your SQL connection let's say your Port has changed and you want to change the SQL connection just so just right click on your connection here and then click on edit connection and you will will be able to edit your connection you also have the option to delete your connection or you also have the option to disconnect from your current connection right so when I click on disconnect it's disconnected and now I'm no longer connected to my post csql server but the configuration is there so let's say at the later point when you want this connection once again click on connect and it will connect once again this is how you can use Visual Studio code to connect to your postc SQL Server then query your postc SQL server using visual studio code that's it for this video I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
