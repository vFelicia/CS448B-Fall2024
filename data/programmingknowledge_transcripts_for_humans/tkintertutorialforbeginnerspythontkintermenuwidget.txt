00:00 - hey everyone today we're gonna talk
00:02 - about the menu widget in painter it is
00:04 - basically to create a menu bar or a list
00:07 - like menu there is nothing complex about
00:09 - it just try to understand how things are
00:11 - working as we write the code so from
00:14 - Tinker
00:18 - import Star
00:21 - and I'll get the window I'll write when
00:24 - equals TK
00:26 - are also given the title I'll write win
00:28 - dot title
00:30 - let the title be menu
00:33 - then I'll add the widget
00:36 - so this widget would be declared with a
00:38 - variable
00:39 - menu which will be the main menu and
00:42 - that would contain the sub menus to be
00:44 - displayed so I'll write menu
00:47 - equals menu and where do I want this
00:50 - menu on the window on the master window
00:52 - so I'll write when
00:54 - so I'll have this main menu where all
00:56 - the other features or objects will be
00:58 - contained like this is the main list
01:00 - that will contain elements with sub
01:02 - lists now I would need to add this to
01:06 - the master window so I'll write
01:08 - dot config
01:11 - menu
01:12 - equals menu
01:14 - this config function can be used to
01:17 - overload if you have an object in
01:19 - thinker that is already configured and
01:21 - you want to edit some of those
01:23 - configurations we use config now we'll
01:26 - create the elements of the main list so
01:28 - I'm gonna create a list with picking
01:30 - tools the size of the tools and then its
01:33 - color so let's do it
01:36 - so first would be tool
01:38 - equals
01:40 - menu
01:43 - and within brackets
01:46 - you can see what all configurations you
01:48 - can given to this menu widget
01:51 - so for master I'll give menu
01:54 - I'll have given a background color
01:57 - Let It Be Gray
02:01 - let the foreground be black
02:07 - I'll also given active background
02:12 - Let It Be Skype
02:15 - okay
02:18 - then I need to add this tool object to
02:22 - the main menu list okay so I'll write
02:24 - menu
02:27 - the variable menu
02:28 - dot add Cascade
02:31 - that is how you add any object to the
02:34 - main list main menu
02:36 - and label equals tool
02:43 - and menu equals tool
02:46 - okay
02:47 - now I'll be adding some options to the
02:50 - tool object so a right tool dot add
02:54 - command
02:55 - you can also add in
02:58 - check buttons and radio buttons but
03:01 - we'll just stick to command for right
03:03 - now and label
03:06 - equals pen
03:11 - then I'll add some more options I'll
03:14 - write tool dot add command
03:18 - label equals brush
03:26 - then tool dot art command label equals
03:30 - pencil
03:36 - then tool dot art command
03:40 - label equals
03:42 - eraser
03:46 - and command equals
03:49 - so I'll given a command to this whenever
03:51 - you click on this option
03:53 - this given command should take place so
03:56 - command would be
03:58 - win dot quit
04:00 - then I'll have another menu object the
04:03 - size so I'll write size
04:06 - equals
04:10 - menu
04:12 - and it's the part of the main menu so
04:15 - I'll write menu in Brackets
04:18 - then I'll add the size objective menu so
04:22 - I'll write menu
04:25 - dot add Cascade
04:30 - label
04:33 - equals size
04:35 - and menu would be
04:42 - I will not decorate this I'll just keep
04:45 - it to default
04:47 - to check out what the default is
04:49 - then I'll add the options to the size
04:52 - object so I'll write size
04:56 - dot add command
05:02 - and label lp1px
05:10 - and similarly I'll do for three four and
05:13 - six PX
05:14 - so I'll just copy this down
05:17 - I'll write 3px
05:23 - 4px
05:25 - and 6px cool
05:30 - I'll have another element
05:33 - for the main menu
05:34 - I'll write Colors
05:37 - equals
05:39 - menu
05:42 - and I'll give it an octave background
05:44 - for this let it be light green
05:47 - and the background let it be light
05:49 - yellow
05:50 - okay
05:53 - I'll add this colors to main menu I'll
05:56 - write menu dot add Cascade
06:06 - label equals colors
06:11 - menu equals colors
06:14 - and I'll add the options to Colors the
06:17 - right colors dot add command
06:21 - label
06:23 - equals red
06:27 - colors dot add command label equals
06:31 - yellow
06:34 - and colors dot add command
06:40 - label equals
06:45 - and I'll call it the main Loop right
06:48 - when dot mean
06:50 - now you can see that even for these
06:52 - options you can given configurations you
06:54 - can have a background color a foreground
06:57 - color
06:58 - a different active background
07:01 - Etc please check them out too they'll
07:04 - help you practice
07:06 - now let's check out how the menu Works
07:08 - how the menu widget Works how it looks
07:11 - like
07:15 - so I have my screen and you can see tool
07:19 - size and colors on the menu bar
07:21 - they are the part of the main menu and
07:24 - when I click on each one of them they
07:27 - display a new menu okay so that's the
07:30 - sub list
07:32 - so I hope you get an idea of how the
07:35 - list was how the menu was organized
07:38 - and you can even add further lists so
07:42 - please try doing that too that would be
07:45 - a practice
07:46 - and when you are quite comfortable with
07:48 - menu you might also look up for menu
07:51 - button
07:52 - try to pick out the differences and
07:54 - benefits of menu button
07:56 - what options menu doesn't provide when
07:59 - your widget doesn't provide but the menu
08:00 - button does
08:03 - so that's it about the menu widget thank
08:06 - you
