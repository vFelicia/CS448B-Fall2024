00:00 - hello everyone welcome to ultrex
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:04 - talk about the creation of a visual data
00:08 - representation in ultrix so it is
00:11 - possible through
00:12 - different tools but we would be looking
00:14 - at the table tool and the interactive
00:17 - chart tool which are primarily used for
00:20 - this purpose so if we talk about the
00:23 - table tool we have studied all about it
00:25 - in the previous video in case you
00:27 - haven't watched it already i would
00:29 - recommend you to just go there and watch
00:31 - it first to understand its basics
00:33 - because in this video i'm not just going
00:35 - to explain the basics again
00:37 - i'm simply just going to show you the
00:39 - application of the uh table tool
00:42 - especially the bar chart part
00:44 - so let's just go to the table tool or
00:47 - this is the basic table tool that we
00:48 - have been using
00:50 - now here if you see there is this option
00:52 - of bar craft so what i have done over
00:54 - here is in this bar graph option i have
00:57 - selected sales
00:58 - and the settings all the settings i have
01:00 - kept as same
01:02 - okay or basically the default settings
01:05 - then what i have done is i have used the
01:07 - render tool and in the render tool i
01:09 - have
01:11 - outputted it in the form of a pdf file
01:13 - so once i run this workflow what would
01:16 - happen is i would be getting this kind
01:18 - of a report
01:19 - uh now all the settings for the table
01:22 - tool are same as we did for the previous
01:25 - file but the format of the file has
01:27 - changed from excel to pdf right now
01:30 - now you can see all these things have
01:31 - been shown like this only but whatever
01:33 - the sales amount is like 732 is the
01:35 - sales amount so a bar a slide bar of
01:39 - light blue color is shown along with its
01:41 - value
01:42 - 71 for 90. so this is how the bar chart
01:44 - tool works we have selected it for the
01:47 - sales value so for the sales value
01:49 - this is how it's been shown
01:51 - like it shows us the bar
01:53 - that would
01:54 - roughly give us an estimate of the
01:56 - quantity that is being or the total
01:58 - sales amount that it is contributing
02:01 - uh with respect to the total amount so
02:04 - this is how we can use the bar chart of
02:06 - the visual representation within a table
02:08 - using the table tool
02:10 - now let us move on to the tool that is
02:12 - specifically designed for this purpose
02:14 - and that is the interactive chart tool
02:16 - so first of all let me just save this
02:18 - workflow and close it because we don't
02:20 - need it anymore we are going to take a
02:23 - look at the interactive chart tool now
02:26 - now what is this interactive chart tool
02:28 - it is used to basically visualize the
02:30 - data in the workflow we can create
02:32 - charts uh interactive multi-layered bar
02:34 - charts line graphs scatter plots pie
02:37 - charts and more we can use your the data
02:40 - set that we've been using to calculate
02:42 - the sum count average minimum maximum of
02:45 - the selected fields and output them into
02:48 - the different file types again using the
02:50 - render tool so first of all let's just
02:52 - get the input file this is our input
02:54 - tool let me just get the file i'm
02:57 - starting with a simple file so let's
02:58 - just go with this course file right now
03:02 - and now what i'm gonna do is apply the
03:04 - interactive chart
03:06 - uh tool over here okay
03:08 - so
03:10 - we can just configure the chart by
03:12 - clicking on this configure chart option
03:15 - and it's going to open up this kind of a
03:17 - dialog box the interactive chart dialog
03:18 - box which would help us to configure the
03:21 - chart okay so we can just create the
03:23 - chart over here
03:25 - in this as you can see there is a format
03:27 - of a chart that's been given to us
03:29 - so we can just create the chart like
03:31 - this
03:33 - control the zoom control the
03:35 - location and everything okay
03:38 - so for this data first you have to
03:40 - ensure that what kind of a chart you
03:42 - want to create i want to create a bar
03:44 - chart okay
03:45 - so
03:46 - once you are in this interactive chart
03:48 - workflow you can just go to create click
03:51 - on layer and here you need to just
03:53 - select on add layer option
03:55 - uh you can give a name to the layer by
03:57 - default it is taken as layer 0 but you
03:59 - can give it any name so what i'm going
04:01 - to do is i'm just going to add bar
04:03 - chart okay
04:07 - then we have the type option in this you
04:09 - need to just select the type of the
04:10 - chart to the bar
04:12 - then uh we have the
04:15 - x which means you need to select the
04:16 - column of which you want on the x axis
04:19 - so i want the
04:21 - score on the x axis on the y axis i want
04:24 - the number of hours okay
04:26 - so that's number of hours
04:28 - and scores to be taken over here okay
04:31 - then uh what we can do is we can just
04:37 - um
04:39 - go to the template if you want a
04:40 - particular template to be used otherwise
04:42 - we can just
04:44 - go with it and
04:47 - so once you have made all the changes as
04:49 - per your choice you can just close that
04:51 - dialog box and bring in the browse tool
04:54 - this would help you to take a look at
04:55 - the chart that you have created so this
04:57 - is the bar chart that we have created
04:59 - based on the data
05:01 - as you can see um
05:03 - here is 98 that is the score and nine is
05:06 - the number of the hours the student has
05:08 - studied so this is how we have got the
05:10 - chart for us but
05:12 - uh if you want to just zoom in you can
05:14 - just zoom in and out of it to get a
05:16 - better look at how the things are
05:17 - looking inside the chart
05:20 - right so this is how basically the chart
05:22 - is created and if you want to create it
05:24 - for different things what we can do is
05:27 - first of all get rid of this data set
05:30 - and bring in our sales data because it
05:32 - has more scope of grading charts it has
05:35 - more values right
05:36 - so let's just go to this output excel
05:38 - file
05:39 - and get in our consumer data set right
05:42 - again we go to this chart option
05:44 - configure chart
05:46 - now there are all types of
05:47 - configurations that you can apply uh
05:50 - right now you can see the score and the
05:51 - number of hours is missing so what we
05:53 - can do is just get rid of it add a new
05:56 - layer
05:57 - again it's going to be a bar chart
06:02 - right now the type is again going to be
06:04 - bar
06:05 - in the column uh i'm just going to get
06:07 - the
06:09 - in the x axis i'm just going to get the
06:12 - sales amount
06:14 - and in the y i'm just going to get the
06:17 - category
06:19 - okay so the category by sales is what i
06:21 - want
06:23 - next what i can do is just basically
06:25 - close it go to the browse tool and run
06:28 - it to get the
06:29 - overview
06:30 - it's going to take a few seconds
06:32 - depending upon the processing speed of
06:34 - your computer and then it would render
06:36 - an output for you
06:38 - so once we have made the changes uh then
06:42 - this is how the output would be looking
06:45 - this is the sales on the basis of the
06:47 - category that is furniture office
06:49 - applies in the technology category
06:51 - and these are the individual sales
06:53 - records that we are getting right now
06:54 - okay
06:55 - uh now using this uh chart tool we can
06:58 - actually configure the chart the way we
07:00 - like okay so there are multiple
07:02 - configuration options that are available
07:05 - like if you just go to this layer option
07:08 - there are these different types of um
07:12 - options that you can perform
07:14 - like the opacity you can select the
07:16 - border width you can select
07:18 - the border color you can just select and
07:21 - everything like this okay
07:23 - so
07:24 - this is how it's going to look
07:26 - um
07:28 - we can just select the different bar
07:29 - modes like stack or overlay
07:32 - or relative to one another
07:36 - next we have is the option for the
07:38 - legend so if you want to work with the
07:40 - legions like if you want to show the
07:42 - lesions or not then you can just select
07:44 - them also you can just
07:47 - hide them all together if you don't want
07:50 - to be shown
07:51 - in the layers panel
07:54 - here you can just select the orientation
07:55 - of the chart as
07:56 - well like this
08:01 - okay
08:02 - so this is what we can do
08:05 - then we have this access part where we
08:08 - can just select the display range like
08:10 - what is the maximum and the minimum
08:12 - range that you want
08:13 - the access line you want to show or hide
08:15 - the grid lines you want to show or hide
08:19 - etc all these things you can just select
08:22 - okay
08:24 - and then we have the batch if you want
08:26 - to create patched charts or not so this
08:29 - is how we work with these charts uh this
08:31 - is a simple bar chart that we have
08:32 - created
08:34 - now let us just move on to another type
08:35 - of a chart uh that we are going to
08:37 - create which is a pie chart let's just
08:39 - see how do we create that real quick
08:42 - so what i'm gonna do is just create a
08:44 - new workflow
08:47 - and in this i'm just gonna copy these
08:49 - two
08:49 - tools
08:51 - actually the three tools can be copied
08:54 - all of these three rules can be copied
08:56 - and pasted over here
08:58 - now for the pie chart what we are going
08:59 - to do is actually create it on the basis
09:02 - of the sales and the category that means
09:04 - there are three categories and i'm just
09:06 - going to get the bifurcated amount of
09:08 - sales for each of these categories
09:10 - so um
09:12 - let's see how do we do that
09:14 - so in the configure chart option we go
09:16 - to the layer and just select the type to
09:20 - pipe
09:20 - the values i have taken to sales and the
09:23 - labels i have set to category this is
09:25 - how it is looking
09:27 - and the name of course i have renamed it
09:29 - to pie chart for more clarity on what is
09:31 - going on now this is how it is looking
09:34 - it is giving me the percentage of the
09:35 - sales
09:36 - in case you want to give it a chart
09:39 - title you can just click here and
09:41 - provide it with a title
09:42 - or if you want to save it as a png file
09:45 - you can just click on this floppy disk
09:46 - icon and you would be able to save it so
09:49 - i'm just going to save it as a chart
09:52 - and let's just see how it is looking so
09:54 - this is my chart.png
09:57 - this is how it's looking this is a
09:58 - legend that tells you that blue
10:00 - represents technology orange represents
10:02 - furniture and green represents office
10:04 - supplies so that's how the charts are
10:06 - created in ultrix that's all for this
10:08 - video
10:08 - thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to ultrex tutorials in this video we are going to talk about the creation of a visual data representation in ultrix so it is possible through different tools but we would be looking at the table tool and the interactive chart tool which are primarily used for this purpose so if we talk about the table tool we have studied all about it in the previous video in case you haven't watched it already i would recommend you to just go there and watch it first to understand its basics because in this video i'm not just going to explain the basics again i'm simply just going to show you the application of the uh table tool especially the bar chart part so let's just go to the table tool or this is the basic table tool that we have been using now here if you see there is this option of bar craft so what i have done over here is in this bar graph option i have selected sales and the settings all the settings i have kept as same okay or basically the default settings then what i have done is i have used the render tool and in the render tool i have outputted it in the form of a pdf file so once i run this workflow what would happen is i would be getting this kind of a report uh now all the settings for the table tool are same as we did for the previous file but the format of the file has changed from excel to pdf right now now you can see all these things have been shown like this only but whatever the sales amount is like 732 is the sales amount so a bar a slide bar of light blue color is shown along with its value 71 for 90. so this is how the bar chart tool works we have selected it for the sales value so for the sales value this is how it's been shown like it shows us the bar that would roughly give us an estimate of the quantity that is being or the total sales amount that it is contributing uh with respect to the total amount so this is how we can use the bar chart of the visual representation within a table using the table tool now let us move on to the tool that is specifically designed for this purpose and that is the interactive chart tool so first of all let me just save this workflow and close it because we don't need it anymore we are going to take a look at the interactive chart tool now now what is this interactive chart tool it is used to basically visualize the data in the workflow we can create charts uh interactive multilayered bar charts line graphs scatter plots pie charts and more we can use your the data set that we've been using to calculate the sum count average minimum maximum of the selected fields and output them into the different file types again using the render tool so first of all let's just get the input file this is our input tool let me just get the file i'm starting with a simple file so let's just go with this course file right now and now what i'm gonna do is apply the interactive chart uh tool over here okay so we can just configure the chart by clicking on this configure chart option and it's going to open up this kind of a dialog box the interactive chart dialog box which would help us to configure the chart okay so we can just create the chart over here in this as you can see there is a format of a chart that's been given to us so we can just create the chart like this control the zoom control the location and everything okay so for this data first you have to ensure that what kind of a chart you want to create i want to create a bar chart okay so once you are in this interactive chart workflow you can just go to create click on layer and here you need to just select on add layer option uh you can give a name to the layer by default it is taken as layer 0 but you can give it any name so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to add bar chart okay then we have the type option in this you need to just select the type of the chart to the bar then uh we have the x which means you need to select the column of which you want on the x axis so i want the score on the x axis on the y axis i want the number of hours okay so that's number of hours and scores to be taken over here okay then uh what we can do is we can just um go to the template if you want a particular template to be used otherwise we can just go with it and so once you have made all the changes as per your choice you can just close that dialog box and bring in the browse tool this would help you to take a look at the chart that you have created so this is the bar chart that we have created based on the data as you can see um here is 98 that is the score and nine is the number of the hours the student has studied so this is how we have got the chart for us but uh if you want to just zoom in you can just zoom in and out of it to get a better look at how the things are looking inside the chart right so this is how basically the chart is created and if you want to create it for different things what we can do is first of all get rid of this data set and bring in our sales data because it has more scope of grading charts it has more values right so let's just go to this output excel file and get in our consumer data set right again we go to this chart option configure chart now there are all types of configurations that you can apply uh right now you can see the score and the number of hours is missing so what we can do is just get rid of it add a new layer again it's going to be a bar chart right now the type is again going to be bar in the column uh i'm just going to get the in the x axis i'm just going to get the sales amount and in the y i'm just going to get the category okay so the category by sales is what i want next what i can do is just basically close it go to the browse tool and run it to get the overview it's going to take a few seconds depending upon the processing speed of your computer and then it would render an output for you so once we have made the changes uh then this is how the output would be looking this is the

want to show or hide the grid lines you want to show or hide etc all these things you can just select okay and then we have the batch if you want to create patched charts or not so this is how we work with these charts uh this is a simple bar chart that we have created now let us just move on to another type of a chart uh that we are going to create which is a pie chart let's just see how do we

floppy disk icon and you would be able to save it so i'm just going to save it as a chart and let's just see how it is looking so this is my chart.png this is how it's looking this is a legend that tells you that blue represents technology orange represents furniture and green represents office supplies so that's how the charts are created in ultrix that's all for this video thanks for
