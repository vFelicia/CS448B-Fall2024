00:08 - this particular series we will be
00:11 - learning how to create contact form in
00:13 - PHP with MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so

00:57 - ahead and create our new project so I
01:00 - have created a directory contact form
01:02 - with index dot PHP and also with custom
01:06 - that CSS files so let's try to open up
01:09 - this index dot PHP file in our code
01:13 - editor so in here we have the empty
01:17 - index dot PHP file so I'll be passing
01:19 - the base structure of our index dot PHP
01:23 - so now we have the HTML structure of our
01:27 - index dot PHP we have the title contact
01:30 - form in the programming knowledge we
01:34 - have set meta attributes we also
01:39 - included the bootstrap minified CSS so
01:41 - in this version or we have included a
01:44 - version 4.1 point is s and we also
01:48 - included a fun from google api s-- you
01:53 - can possibly
01:53 - don't try to copy all the contents here
01:55 - and we also included this custom CSS
01:59 - that we have defined in our directory
02:01 - here and then we have defined the div
02:08 - with class container and row we also
02:13 - define column xn8 inside this division
02:21 - we have defied h1 with the link for our
02:25 - website so contact form tutorial from
02:29 - programming knowledge and we also
02:32 - included the paragraph that says this is
02:36 - a demo for a tutorial dedicated to
02:38 - crafting working boots or contact form
02:40 - with PHP and Ajax in the background and
02:45 - before the closing body tag we also have
02:48 - included different scripts say for
02:51 - example we have included the jQuery
02:53 - minified @j s so again version 3.3 point
02:58 - one another script will be the popper
03:02 - ejs with version one point fourteen
03:05 - point three another script bootstrap
03:08 - that mean minified that Jas and also the
03:14 - validator that minified or that mean
03:17 - that Jas we also have define a script
03:23 - with contact GS as the source so we will
03:28 - be creating this file later on you can
03:31 - search for the CDN for this files okay
03:35 - to include in your project jQuery we
03:38 - have the bootstrap we have deep operate
03:40 - that we defied that GS and also with the
03:42 - validator that means a J's you could
03:44 - search for this CDN in the Internet and
03:47 - include that into this part right here
03:50 - just right above the closing body tag
03:55 - and inside this division we will be
04:00 - putting in the form for our contact form
04:05 - so I'll just go ahead and paste the
04:08 - Kanta for element okay we need to indent
04:16 - this so it would be readable for us so
04:19 - we have deformed element with ID contact
04:22 - - form we have the method post the
04:25 - action instead of contact that PHP let
04:28 - us set this into index dot PHP and the
04:33 - role is for we have also added div with
04:38 - class messages and here article trolls
04:43 - so div class controls we will define
04:46 - another day with class row and let's add
04:52 - another div with class column medium six
04:57 - and inside this division we will be
05:01 - adding the form group div and inside
05:06 - this day we will be having the label for
05:09 - our first name one of the most important
05:12 - tags here the input for our first name
05:15 - of course we have the ID for underscore
05:20 - name with type text' name which is yes
05:27 - name and class form control placeholder
05:31 - will be please enter your your first
05:34 - name and of course this is a required
05:37 - field and also we will be having the dip
05:42 - with the class helped block with errors
05:46 - okay
05:48 - the same thing with the last name so
05:52 - column medium six form group label for
05:57 - our last name and input name so we have
06:03 - input ID with form last name form
06:07 - underscore last name with type tags we
06:10 - also have the name as the surname class
06:13 - the same form control placeholder
06:18 - please enter your last name required
06:23 - field and we have this health lock again
06:30 - here so Dave have with errors classes
06:35 - and we will add another row that will
06:41 - hold the second row which will be for
06:44 - our email and the specific need that we
06:48 - are trying to request so for example we
06:50 - have requests for occupation request
06:53 - order status require a request copy of
06:56 - an invoice and other so again this is
07:00 - for email we will define the Deb grid
07:05 - form - group class label for email and
07:10 - input ID for email type email the name
07:17 - for this field will be email of course
07:18 - and class s for control placeholder will
07:25 - be enter your email course and required
07:28 - field again and this will be for our
07:32 - help block if there are errors also with
07:36 - errors and here this is a bit different
07:40 - from other fields so we have defined the
07:44 - form group and label and this will be
07:48 - the select or the drop-down box that we
07:52 - will be seeing later in our form so we
07:55 - have the first option will be empty the
07:58 - second will be request for quotation
08:00 - this third one will be request order
08:03 - status and the fourth one will be this
08:06 - request copy of an invoice we have
08:11 - another row for our message so column
08:15 - medium child form group label for our
08:19 - message with the four attribute set to
08:24 - form underscore message which is this
08:27 - idea right here so text area ID equals
08:31 - four
08:31 - underscore message name of this text
08:36 - area s message form control again
08:41 - placeholder will be message for me and
08:46 - the standard help block with errors step
08:50 - with all these classes right here and
08:53 - the last will be the submit button of
08:57 - our fourth so then class column medium
09:02 - child and an input type submit class BTN
09:07 - BTN - success BTN - send with the values
09:12 - and message so save your file for now
09:17 - and let's try to preview our index dot
09:21 - PHP so let's go ahead go to our browser
09:26 - and navigate to this localhost / contact
09:33 - form or whatever the directory you have
09:36 - created earlier so in my case that is
09:38 - contact form so if I try to refresh this
09:42 - page so we will have this contact form
09:50 - with all the elements that we have added
09:53 - so the first name last name email the
09:57 - specific request and the message and
10:00 - also the button right here okay so I
10:06 - think that's it for this tutorial and in
10:08 - the next video we will move to the
10:10 - exciting part of creating this contact
10:13 - form thanks
10:22 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on guys welcome back to programming knowledge and this is another video tutorial series and in this particular series we will be learning how to create contact form in PHP with MySQL jQuery and bootstrap so at the end of this video tutorial series we will have this particular contact form with all these fields first name last name email and others and we should be able to send email when we try to send or click on this button so in this lecture I'm going to walk you through the basic structure of our contact form we will be adding on custom.css and also we will be laying
