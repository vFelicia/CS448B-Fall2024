00:33 - which is the official website for wine
00:37 - right so just enter wine HQ in Search
00:42 - and the first link which will appear
00:44 - here will be from

00:48 - link
00:49 - here you can read about wine
00:54 - we want to download it so just click on
00:56 - the download link here
00:58 - and then you can choose the binaries

01:06 - and then you can see the step-by-step
01:09 - guide to install
01:12 - the wine on your Ubuntu operating system
01:16 - so we're going to just copy these
01:19 - commands and paste it into our Ubuntu
01:23 - operating system so for this I need to
01:26 - open the terminal for opening the
01:28 - terminal I can just press Ctrl alt t on
01:31 - my keyboard or I can just click on the
01:35 - application section and I can see the
01:37 - terminal option here once the terminal
01:40 - is open I can give this command which I
01:45 - have copied which is this First Command
01:47 - let me just make it bigger so you can
01:50 - see all these commands here so this is
01:53 - the command which I have copied and I
01:56 - have pasted this here okay so now I'm
02:00 - going to press enter and give my
02:02 - ubuntu's password
02:04 - and then this is added now we need to
02:09 - give the next command which is this
02:12 - command which is going to create this
02:15 - directory in your Ubuntu operating
02:18 - system let me just paste this command
02:20 - and then press enter
02:22 - then give the next command which is to
02:25 - get this mine HQ key let me just copy
02:30 - this and then paste this and then press
02:33 - enter
02:34 - and this is added now
02:37 - once you added the Repository
02:40 - depending on the version of Ubuntu you
02:44 - have you can copy one of these links
02:48 - so for me I have Ubuntu 22.04 so I'm
02:53 - going to copy this line of command if
02:58 - you have newer version it will be listed
03:00 - here so just copy the command for your
03:05 - Ubuntu version as I said I have Ubuntu
03:08 - 22.0 first I am going to copy this
03:11 - command
03:12 - and then paste it into my terminal and
03:16 - then press enter
03:18 - so once you have added this command and
03:21 - executed this command you can see this
03:24 - command is executed successfully so what
03:28 - this has done
03:30 - this is downloaded the wine HQ source
03:33 - file
03:34 - now in The Next
03:37 - Step you need to give this command which
03:41 - is sudo apt update
03:44 - so it's going to update all the
03:47 - Ubuntu package indexes
03:49 - and you can see
03:52 - this is also added now right so sudo apt
03:58 - update is finished and now the last step
04:00 - is to install the Vine
04:04 - so you can choose from these uh versions
04:08 - I generally go with the stable branch
04:10 - which is the first one you can also try
04:15 - development Branch or staging Branch but
04:18 - I will choose the stable Branch from
04:20 - here so I'm I will copy this one and
04:23 - then paste it into my terminal and then
04:25 - press enter
04:26 - and then press y enter
04:29 - which is going to install wine on my
04:32 - Ubuntu operating system
04:34 - so let's wait for it to finish so once
04:39 - wine is installed you can
04:42 - try wine and install any exe file let me
04:47 - uh clear the terminal
04:50 - and then I will just write this wine
04:52 - command here and you can see uh wine is
04:56 - working for using wine you need to give
05:00 - wine and then the program name and then
05:03 - some arguments here right
05:05 - so let's download uh Windows executable
05:09 - file and then we will try to install
05:12 - that executable file in our Ubuntu
05:14 - operating system
05:16 - so let's say I want to download
05:19 - notepad plus plus on my Ubuntu operating
05:23 - system
05:24 - as you might know notepad plus plus only
05:28 - comes in the form of Windows executable
05:31 - file and we don't have the Ubuntu
05:35 - version for it right so I'm going to
05:37 - click on download notepad and then I'm
05:40 - going to click on
05:42 - this installer option here
05:45 - and you can see it downloads the dot exe
05:49 - file
05:51 - you also know that you can't install dot
05:54 - exe file directly on your Linux
05:56 - operating system right so for this you
05:58 - will need wine
06:00 - so this notepad plus plus exe file is
06:03 - downloaded I'm going to go to the
06:05 - location where it's downloaded which is
06:08 - in my downloads folder and this is the
06:11 - exe file which I have downloaded right

06:33 - which is going to load this exe file
06:37 - using vine on my Ubuntu operating system
06:41 - you can see wine mono installer right I
06:45 - can click on install
06:47 - which is going to start downloading
06:50 - this
06:51 - installer I think
06:54 - so wait for some time and then you will
06:56 - see

07:03 - so even though it's an exe file I can
07:06 - install this exe file on my Ubuntu
07:08 - operating system right
07:10 - so you can see the installation of
07:13 - notepad plus plus is started and I can
07:17 - choose the language click on OK and then
07:20 - click on next and then click on I agree
07:24 - and this will be the default location we

07:40 - leaving this checkbox as checked click
07:42 - on finish
07:43 - and it's going to launch Notepad plus
07:46 - plus hopefully you can see notepad plus
07:49 - plus is
07:51 - started on your Ubuntu operating system
07:54 - using the exe file right
07:57 - if I go to the applications and search
