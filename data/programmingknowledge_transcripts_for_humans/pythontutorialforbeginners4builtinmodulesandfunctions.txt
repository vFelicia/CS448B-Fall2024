00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to use buil-in modules and
00:06 - functions in Python so if you have
00:09 - remembered that in the previous videos I
00:14 - have shown you how to calculate the
00:18 - exponent of some Valu so for example I
00:20 - want 2 to the power 3 I can use two and
00:25 - then these two SRI and then I can write
00:28 - three and this means 2 to the exponent 3
00:31 - and it gives me the value of 8 okay but
00:35 - there is a easier way of doing the same
00:39 - thing and this is by using a builting
00:43 - functions which are provided by python
00:46 - so what uh is a function first of all if
00:49 - you are new to programming a function is
00:53 - a piece of code which execute some
00:57 - function or some log IC okay so a
01:02 - function is a piece of code which
01:04 - executes some logic so for example you
01:06 - want to calculate the exponent of
01:09 - two like this you can do it like this or
01:13 - you can use a built-in function which
01:15 - execute a exponent function right so you
01:20 - can
01:21 - use p w which is power and this uh
01:28 - function takes two arguments
01:30 - first is the value which is two and then
01:34 - the exponent which is three or this
01:38 - means 2 to the^ 3 and it also gives you
01:41 - the
01:42 - value
01:43 - uh8 which is same and it's more easier
01:47 - to use uh this and it's more easier to
01:50 - understand this expression rather than
01:53 - this because it's more descriptive right
01:57 - now how do you know that at what are the
02:01 - built-in function in Python okay so if
02:06 - you don't know what are the buil-in
02:08 - function there is a command to know what
02:11 - are all built-in functions in Python and
02:16 - what is this command this command is you
02:19 - just need to write
02:20 - diir and then give these two brackets
02:24 - and these two brackets just
02:26 - write double underscore and and then
02:30 - just
02:31 - write build ins and then double un
02:35 - underscore once again and you just need
02:38 - to give this
02:39 - command and what this command just press
02:42 - enter and what this command will return
02:45 - this command will return all the
02:47 - built-in function which you can use in
02:50 - Python okay so for example I was using p
02:54 - which is a power function and you can
02:58 - find this P function function here okay
03:02 - this is the power function so you can
03:04 - see you can calculate hacks there is a
03:08 - function called ABS to calculate
03:11 - absolute value so for example I want to
03:13 - calculate I will use Ab s and I will
03:18 - write uh
03:20 - 18.
03:22 - 666 and press enter it gives me the
03:26 - absolute value of ABS uh uh this should
03:30 - be little bit different I think it
03:34 - should be like
03:37 - this and okay so it gives me the
03:40 - absolute value of um the number okay or
03:47 - you can uh use this print to print
03:50 - something or you can find this Len
03:53 - function to find the length of a string
03:56 - so I can use Ln and give some strings
04:01 - for example I can
04:04 - write hello which is uh five letter
04:09 - string 1 2 3 4 five right and this
04:14 - length will return the length of this
04:16 - word which gives five
04:19 - right so uh and there are some other
04:23 - useful functions like minimum maximum
04:27 - slice so these are all the built-in
04:31 - functions in uh python
04:35 - now once you know the function that okay
04:38 - this function exist here now how you can
04:42 - know that uh what is the functionality
04:46 - of this function right so to know the
04:49 - functionality of the function what you
04:51 - need to
04:53 - do you can use a buil-in function called
04:56 - help this help okay so for example you
05:00 - want to know what this uh function
05:04 - called Max does okay so what you can do
05:09 - you can just write help and then in the
05:13 - brackets you can just write the name of
05:15 - the function for example you want to
05:16 - know what this function Max does you
05:19 - just write help and in the bracket just
05:21 - write Max okay and press enter and this
05:26 - Max you can see
05:28 - here so this helps is that this Max is a
05:32 - function which can take uh more than one
05:37 - argument multiple argument and it gives
05:40 - the I think maximum value of those uh uh
05:44 - arguments right
05:47 - so you can see it with a single iterable
05:52 - argument returns its largest item okay
05:56 - so now I know that when I use a function
05:59 - called Max and I can give multiple
06:03 - argument uh
06:05 - 4 comma 2 comma 1 comma 5 comma 8 and
06:12 - when I press enter it gives me the
06:14 - maximum value which is 8 right so in
06:18 - this way you can use this help function
06:20 - to find out what these other buil-in
06:24 - function uh does or what is the use of
06:28 - these buil-in function
06:30 - right now this is about the uh function
06:36 - built-in function now there is something
06:38 - called buil-in
06:40 - modules okay and these buil-in modules
06:44 - are the extra modules which contains
06:47 - extra functions or extra functionalities
06:51 - which you can use whenever you use or
06:54 - whenever you you include these modules
06:57 - so for example
06:59 - uh you want to know uh or you want to
07:04 - calculate the square root of uh some
07:07 - value so there is a module called so for
07:12 - example you want to um know the square
07:15 - root of something so there is a module
07:19 - called math you can use it for this so
07:23 - to include a module you need to import
07:26 - this module and how you can import just
07:28 - write
07:30 - import and this is the keyword to
07:32 - include a module and then the name of
07:35 - the module which is for example math in
07:38 - our case and when you press enter now
07:41 - you have included this module now how
07:44 - you can use the function inside this
07:47 - module you can just uh you write the
07:51 - name of this module which is math Dot
07:55 - and then you can use all the you can see
08:00 - there are different options uh which you
08:02 - can use with this module called math you
08:06 - can see here right so whenever
08:10 - you write dot it'll give you some
08:13 - options you can see and this options you
08:18 - can scroll it by um up and down Keys
08:22 - okay so this math module has this much
08:26 - amount of built-in functions right you
08:29 - can scroll up or scroll down and what
08:32 - function I'm you I'm want to use I want
08:35 - to search for square root so there is a
08:39 - square root yeah okay so I can use
08:42 - square
08:43 - root uh I have pressed enter so uh this
08:47 - giv
08:48 - me uh some value so once again math do
08:55 - sqrt and then I can find the square root
08:59 - of any number for example I want to find
09:01 - the square root 9 it will give me the
09:03 - answer three so in this way there are
09:06 - some built-in module also and this these
09:09 - buil-in module also have some function
09:11 - built-in functions and you can import
09:14 - these built-in modules using a keyword
09:17 - input and the name of the module and
09:19 - then you can use these modules like the
09:22 - name of the module and the function
09:24 - which it
09:26 - contains now sometimes these uh
09:30 - modules uh are you know uh hard to uh
09:35 - you know spell or write so what you can
09:38 - do you can Define your own variable for
09:41 - these module names for example I can
09:45 - declare a variable
09:47 - called
09:50 - uh square
09:53 - root which is equal to this math do sqr
10:00 - okay now whenever you use square root uh
10:05 - variable you can perform the same
10:08 - functionality for example I want to find
10:11 - out the square root of 9 it will give me
10:13 - three so you can replace these built-in
10:17 - functions in module by your variable
10:20 - using this equal to
10:22 - sign okay and now you have your own
10:25 - variable which can
10:27 - calculate the uh square root or any
10:30 - other function so in this way you can
10:33 - use buil-in modules and buil-in
10:35 - functions in Python I hope you have

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to use builin modules and functions in Python so if you have remembered that in the previous videos I have shown you how to calculate the exponent of some Valu so for example I want 2 to the power 3 I can use two and then these two SRI and then I can write three and this means 2 to the exponent 3 and it gives me the value of 8 okay but there is a easier way of doing the same thing and this is by using a builting functions which are provided by python so what uh is a function first of all if you are new to programming a function is a piece of code which execute some function or some log IC okay so a function is a piece of code which executes some logic so for example you want to calculate the exponent of two like this you can do it like this or you can use a builtin function which execute a exponent function right so you can use p w which is power and this uh function takes two arguments first is the value which is two and then the exponent which is three or this means 2 to the^ 3 and it also gives you the value uh8 which is same and it's more easier to use uh this and it's more easier to understand this expression rather than this because it's more descriptive right now how do you know that at what are the builtin function in Python okay so if you don't know what are the builin function there is a command to know what are all builtin functions in Python and what is this command this command is you just need to write diir and then give these two brackets and these two brackets just write double underscore and and then just write build ins and then double un underscore once again and you just need to give this command and what this command just press enter and what this command will return this command will return all the builtin function which you can use in Python okay so for example I was using p which is a power function and you can find this P function function here okay this is the power function so you can see you can calculate hacks there is a function called ABS to calculate absolute value so for example I want to calculate I will use Ab s and I will write uh 18. 666 and press enter it gives me the absolute value of ABS uh uh this should be little bit different I think it should be like this and okay so it gives me the absolute value of um the number okay or you can uh use this print to print something or you can find this Len function to find the length of a string so I can use Ln and give some strings for example I can write hello which is uh five letter string 1 2 3 4 five right and this length will return the length of this word which gives five right so uh and there are some other useful functions like minimum maximum slice so these are all the builtin functions in uh python now once you know the function that okay this function exist here now how you can know that uh what is the functionality of this function right so to know the functionality of the function what you need to do you can use a builin function called help this help okay so for example you want to know what this uh function called Max does okay so what you can do you can just write help and then in the brackets you can just write the name of the function for example you want to know what this function Max does you just write help and in the bracket just write Max okay and press enter and this Max you can see here so this helps is that this Max is a function which can take uh more than one argument multiple argument and it gives the I think maximum value of those uh uh arguments right so you can see it with a single iterable argument returns its largest item okay so now I know that when I use a function called Max and I can give multiple argument uh 4 comma 2 comma 1 comma 5 comma 8 and when I press enter it gives me the maximum value which is 8 right so in this way you can use this help function to find out what these other builin function uh does or what is the use of these builin function right now this is about the uh function builtin function now there is something called builin modules okay and these builin modules are the extra modules which contains extra functions or extra functionalities which you can use whenever you use or whenever you you include these modules so for example uh you want to know uh or you want to calculate the square root of uh some value so there is a module called so for example you want to um know the square root of something so there is a module called math you can use it for this so to include a module you need to import this module and how you can import just write import and this is the keyword to include a module and then the name of the module which is for example math in our case and when you press enter now you have included this module now how you can use the function inside this module you can just uh you write the name of this module which is math Dot and then you can use all the you can see there are different options uh which you can use with this module called math you can see here right so whenever you write dot it'll give you some options you can see and this options you can scroll it by um up and down Keys okay so this math module has this much amount of builtin functions right you can scroll up or scroll down and what function I'm you I'm want to use I want to search for square root so there is a square root yeah okay so I can use square root uh I have pressed enter so uh this giv me uh some value so once again math do sqrt and then I can find the square root of any number for example I want to find the square root 9 it will give me the answer three so in this way there are some builtin module also and this these builin module also have some function builtin functions and you can import these builtin modules using a keyword input and the name of the module and then you can use these modules like the name of the module and the function which it contains now sometimes these uh modules uh are you know uh hard to uh you know spell or write so what you can do you can Define your own variable for these module names for example I can declare a variable called uh square root which is equal to this math do sqr okay now whenever you use square root uh variable you can perform the same functionality for example I want to find out the square root of 9 it will give me three so you can replace these builtin functions in module by your variable using this equal to sign okay and now you have your own variable which can calculate the uh square root or any other function so in this way you can use builin modules and builin functions in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment subscribe and bye for now
