00:01 - hello guys and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in the previous video we
00:06 - learned about how to create menu option
00:09 - in a kinder window for example one which
00:13 - are created here in the previous video I
00:15 - will show you the output so this is the
00:20 - menu field which we created with
00:23 - basically two functionality so far about
00:26 - it is showing the message box and
00:30 - profile insert it will exit the window
00:33 - so we long to will move on to the next
00:37 - step that is creating a window within a
00:42 - window so for example after registration
00:46 - of a successful registration
00:48 - I want to redirect or get a new window
00:53 - and which basically is a login window so
00:57 - after successful registration I want a
01:00 - new window about login that kind of
01:06 - situation so in here I just show you a
01:09 - small demo that how you can create a
01:13 - window good thing even though in kinder
01:18 - and using a nada button so right now
01:26 - there are only two button that is sign
01:28 - up and quit so for this we'll be using
01:31 - another button that is a login button
01:35 - and let's create one right now so at the
01:39 - bottom so these are the to sign up and
01:46 - quit button copy one of them and
01:58 - rename it as a login button so it is not
02:02 - basically a login window I'm making a
02:05 - I'm just showing a demo that how you can
02:07 - create one using the approach which I'm
02:10 - telling you right now okay
02:13 - so rename the text login cute as it is
02:22 - and for right now there is no come on
02:26 - okay and we'll place it add two and
02:37 - eight and the y-axis will be around 60
02:42 - so 60 so let's see the output as you can
02:50 - see it is in between of this sign up and
02:53 - quit button okay so this is the button
02:56 - which we have created now what we'll
03:00 - have to do is create a function which
03:05 - can be used for opening another window
03:12 - so create a function defined and name it
03:20 - as second wind : and similarly like the
03:34 - one which we have created and that is a
03:41 - first of all we need to create a window
03:46 - object that is when is equal to T
03:51 - kay okay then
03:56 - put a title to that second window dot
04:00 - sorry title and name it as welcome
04:10 - - second window okay now we'll just go
04:21 - at it simple geometry Oh we'll just go
04:29 - word is at I guess 250 look 50 and X 200
04:41 - so this is like a height and do it and
04:47 - now we just provide a label we just copy
04:51 - or one melt problem we'll just name it
04:55 - label underscore on zero to shield okay
05:05 - then provide a label now when it comes
05:12 - to the second window you don't have to
05:14 - provide the main route window that is
05:17 - over here because it's for that main
05:20 - window now you're creating entirely new
05:23 - kinder windows so for that you need to
05:27 - use the route or the window which is
05:32 - provided over here just taken as a
05:34 - parent object for the kilter frame right
05:38 - okay so we'll be using window comma now
05:43 - text is equal to registration stration
05:58 - so this is basically a label sorry for
06:04 - that I just place it inside okay
06:08 - station successful
06:15 - the spelling is wrong okay or you can
06:19 - just say it as successful mission
06:23 - completed right okay so this looks good
06:28 - and we'll be providing relief is equal
06:40 - to solid that is for relief is equal
06:48 - solid , and which is quite fond fond is
06:59 - equal to area I'm stabbing things right
07:06 - okay so we'll just come over here this
07:13 - part a parenthesis Ariel then comma 12
07:23 - comma bold right and we'll close that
07:31 - too and we'll just place it just cancel
07:42 - this one it is creating an obstacle so
07:45 - place that at X is equal to on 30 and y
07:55 - is equal to 70 so it is a small window
07:58 - and we also create a small button button
08:07 - and this cause 0 2 0 1 whatever you can
08:11 - name it this is copy the button down
08:15 - from down here
08:21 - don't want to type it okay so okay so
08:32 - Fagin alright so just a sheet over here
08:37 - change the position up it as eighty and
08:48 - zero okay white okay no problem
08:54 - okay this is called it this looks good
08:58 - okay so okay now here we have to change
09:02 - the window to window and just rename it
09:12 - all you can provide it as demo button no
09:17 - problem with that again and okay so now
09:23 - this is this looks good and now we just
09:27 - go down to the login button over here
09:30 - and provide that come on comma oops
09:41 - command is equal to second well okay so
09:47 - so let's run this and see what is the
09:50 - output okay so that there is no error
09:52 - right now and we'll click so so as you
09:58 - can see there this is an entirely new
10:02 - window now with a label registration
10:06 - completed and a button demo so right now
10:10 - there is no functionality to that button
10:12 - but I'll just quote a simple message box
10:15 - to it so this are two entirely two
10:18 - different window so for the purpose of
10:22 - so advancement to this entire reception
10:24 - form one can create a registration form
10:27 - with certain violation and can redirect
10:30 - it to on the second window and provide
10:33 - some entry widgets like
10:35 - login name and user password with to
10:39 - enter visits and a login so this is a
10:44 - basic idea how you can perform so these
10:46 - are two different entire two different
10:49 - windows so this is how you can perform
10:50 - one and I'll just provide a function ID
10:54 - third button let me just type in here
10:57 - command is equal to about maybe I'll
11:04 - just check whether it is up or down
11:08 - yeah it is definitely up I guess
11:12 - okay so let's see whether it works or
11:15 - not
11:18 - so log in this is the second button and
11:22 - let's click on do this demo so as you
11:25 - can see it works so this is this is the
11:28 - second window and we have provided a
11:30 - single function that is a message box to
11:32 - this demo button with a message box
11:35 - right so as you can see this is basic
11:39 - approach of creating two separate
11:41 - windows from one same window so over
11:44 - here I have created three sign up quit
11:47 - and login and from by clicking login
11:49 - this particular button opens right so
11:53 - this is it for this video guys if you
11:57 - have any more implementation to this
12:02 - existing approach you can use it or for
12:08 - the advancement and thanks for watching

hello guys and welcome to programming knowledge in the previous video we learned about how to create menu option in a kinder window for example one which are created here in the previous video I will show you the output so this is the menu field which we created with basically two functionality so far about it is showing the message box and profile insert it will exit the window so we long to will move on to the next step that is creating a window within a window so for example after registration of a successful registration I want to redirect or get a new window and which basically is a login
