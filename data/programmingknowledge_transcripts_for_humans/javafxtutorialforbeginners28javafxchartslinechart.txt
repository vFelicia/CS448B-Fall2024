00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how to use LINE charts
00:07 - in Java FX so let's get started first of
00:11 - all what I've done is I've created this
00:13 - uh sample Java FX project in which I
00:16 - have this application package and inside
00:18 - this application package I have this
00:21 - main. Java class in which I am calling
00:25 - this uh main. fxml file as I always do
00:29 - right and then I have this blank main
00:33 - controller. Java class and I have this
00:36 - main. fxml file so first of all what I'm
00:40 - going to do is I'm going to open this
00:43 - main. fxml file using scene Builder and
00:47 - uh in here first of all I'm going to
00:50 - resize the anchor pane so just select
00:53 - the anchor Pane and just resize it for
00:56 - example 500 by 500 here okay press enter
01:02 - and then next what I'm going to do is
01:04 - I'm going to go to the charts here and
01:08 - I'm going to drag and drop a line chart
01:10 - control inside my anchor Pane and let's
01:15 - resize our anchor pin and now what I'm
01:19 - going to do next is I'm going to go to
01:22 - controls and I'm going to take a button
01:24 - from here so when I click this button
01:27 - it's going to load this chart so the
01:30 - text of this chart I'm going to name it
01:33 - as load chart okay so
01:37 - load
01:38 - chart and uh I'm going to change the FX
01:42 - ID of this uh line chart here so go to
01:48 - the code and give some FX ID to your
01:51 - line chart for example
01:54 - line chart itself okay and then you have
02:00 - some properties for line charts so go to
02:03 - the properties here and you can see
02:05 - there is a title which you can give for
02:07 - example
02:09 - line chart and press enter and it's
02:11 - going to show this title on the top you
02:15 - can uh move the title to the bottom or
02:18 - the left or the right but let's uh you
02:23 - know stick to the top right and you have
02:27 - this uh Legend also if you want to show
02:30 - the Legends then you can choose by
02:33 - clicking this uh check boox here if you
02:36 - want don't want to uh show the Legends
02:38 - then you can just uncheck this okay and
02:41 - this is the position of the legend uh
02:44 - where it will be shown okay there are
02:46 - some more properties here which you can
02:49 - uh you know experiment with so just uh
02:52 - experiment with these properties and uh
02:55 - then uh see how it looks like okay the
02:59 - last property here in this section is
03:03 - xais so leave it as default okay because
03:06 - we are going to use xais series for our
03:10 - line chart okay so next what I'm going
03:14 - to do is I'm going to add the controller
03:17 - to this fxml file so just go to the
03:20 - controller here and select the
03:22 - application. main controller. Java file
03:25 - right so once everything is done save
03:29 - your code
03:30 - and go to your project and refresh it
03:33 - and then go to main controller. Java
03:36 - class and in here first of all we are
03:38 - going to Define this line chart so just
03:41 - write atate fxml and then line chart
03:47 - just call the line chart variable and it
03:49 - takes uh two template argument one is
03:52 - x-axis and other is y AIS okay so if you
03:57 - go to your main FX ml file in your
04:01 - Eclipse IDE you can see it has uh two
04:05 - elements here one is xais element which
04:08 - is category AIS by default created by
04:11 - the scene Builder and second is number
04:14 - AIS right which is y AIS okay so
04:19 - category AIS means you can uh give the
04:22 - first argument here or data type here as
04:26 - string okay and the second is the number
04:30 - Access you can see so number means you
04:33 - can give here number so you can just
04:36 - write number here okay and then your uh
04:42 - ID so we have given the ID to this chart
04:46 - as line chart so just take the same uh
04:49 - name from here and just close it okay
04:52 - and now I'm going to create a method for
04:55 - the button click event so just create a
04:59 - public void method so it's going to
05:02 - return void and the name of this method
05:06 - I'm going to name it as BTN okay and
05:09 - it's going to perform this action event
05:12 - so just call Action event
05:15 - event and inside this button click
05:18 - method first of all what we are going to
05:21 - do is we are going to declare uh x x
05:25 - access series okay so just call XY chart
05:30 - here just call it something like this
05:33 - and then before this template argument
05:35 - we are going to uh create a series so XY
05:39 - chart.
05:42 - series and we are going to give the same
05:46 - template argument which we have given
05:47 - for the line chart which is uh string
05:50 - and number okay and then name your
05:54 - series for
05:56 - example series itself is equal equal to
06:00 - new series so just copy the same thing
06:05 - and paste it here and close it okay now
06:09 - you have your Series so in this series
06:13 - you can add some data so just call this
06:17 - series variable and then call a method
06:20 - called get data and then we are going to
06:23 - add the data and it's going to take this
06:27 - XY chart data variables so just write
06:30 - new and then take this XY chart from
06:33 - here dot data and data will be of uh
06:39 - same type so just give these two
06:41 - template arguments here and uh you can
06:44 - see here it takes the string and the
06:46 - number so you can just give a string
06:50 - here and the number as the second
06:52 - argument so for example uh we are uh
06:56 - making some uh line chart on the basis
07:00 - of some month okay so for example uh we
07:04 - can just write Jan and for example the
07:08 - earning of uh January is something so
07:12 - for example 200 okay and in the same way
07:16 - you can add more items to this series
07:21 - okay so we are going to just paste it
07:24 - four times and then we have Fab and
07:30 - March and April right and the earnings
07:36 - for example
07:37 - 500
07:39 - 300 and 600 here okay and then once you
07:44 - have created your series then you can uh
07:48 - add the series to the line chart so just
07:51 - call your line chart and then call a
07:55 - method called get data and then add
08:00 - the series to it so just add this series
08:03 - variable here okay and then semicolon
08:07 - now one last thing which remains is we
08:10 - need to add this function to the fxml
08:13 - file okay so just open your uh fxml file
08:18 - in scene Builder select your button go
08:21 - to the onaction uh category here and
08:24 - choose this button method okay and then
08:27 - save everything and and refresh your
08:30 - project from here and then run it and
08:35 - our app is running now so when I click
08:38 - this load chart button is going to uh
08:41 - load this kind of a chart right now uh
08:45 - when I click this load chart again you
08:48 - can see a new uh line is added and you
08:52 - have two legends here right and then
08:57 - third Legend and fourth Legend and you
09:00 - can see the Legends are increasing one
09:03 - by one right so to solve this problem
09:06 - what we can do here is we can go to our
09:09 - button method and then at the top at the
09:13 - start of our method we can take our line
09:16 - chart and then get data and then uh
09:21 - clear our chart okay so this is going to
09:24 - clear our chart every time we uh click
09:27 - the button first and then load the chart
09:30 - so this problem will be gone so once
09:32 - again run your app and once again click
09:35 - load chart and now only one access is
09:39 - there and you can see only one Legend
09:42 - here now you can even set the name of
09:45 - the legend using Series so you can just
09:49 - take this series variable and then you
09:52 - can just say set name from here and you
09:56 - can give any uh string variable here for
09:59 - example month pay here okay and save
10:03 - your code and run your app once again
10:06 - and load chart and now you can see uh
10:10 - it's showing month pay okay now one more
10:13 - thing you may ask here is how you can
10:17 - give the label to uh your x-axis and Y
10:22 - AIS here so let's see how we can give
10:24 - the labels to x-axis and y-axis so what
10:28 - you can do is is you can go to your
10:30 - main. fxml file in here you have x-axis
10:34 - and Y AIS right so go to your category
10:37 - accs first and in here you can give any
10:41 - label by this attribute called label
10:44 - here okay so label is equal to some name
10:50 - for example my X label for example and
10:55 - same you can do for the Y AIS so go to
10:59 - to your y-axis and and with this uh
11:02 - number Access uh property you can uh add
11:05 - this attribute called label once again
11:08 - and say my y label okay save your code
11:13 - and run it once
11:15 - again and load your chart and now you
11:19 - can see on the Y uh AIS you can see the
11:22 - Y label and on the x-axis you can see
11:26 - this label right x-axis label
11:29 - so this is called label this is the
11:32 - legend right so Legend is different than
11:35 - label label is this one and this is
11:38 - called Legend okay so in this way you
11:42 - can use line chart in Java FX I hope you

just close it okay and now I'm going to create a method for the button click event so just create a public void method so it's going to return void and the name of this method I'm going to name it as

load this kind of a chart right now uh when I click this load chart again you can see a new uh line is added and you have two legends here right and then third Legend and fourth Legend and you can see the Legends are increasing one by one right so to solve this problem what we can do here is we can go to our button method and then at the top at the start of our method we can take our line chart and then get data and then uh clear our chart okay so this is going to clear our chart every time we uh click the button first and then load the chart so this problem will be gone so once again run your

see this label right xaxis label so this is called label this is the legend right so Legend is different than label label is this one and this is called Legend okay so in this way you can use line chart in Java FX I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
