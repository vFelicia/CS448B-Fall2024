00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see that
00:04 - what is the unique key constraint unique
00:09 - key is somehow related to primary key
00:13 - whenever you want a particular column to
00:16 - have all the distinct or different
00:18 - values and you do not want a column to
00:22 - contain duplicate values and you can
00:25 - assign or add unique constraint to that
00:28 - particular column the only key
00:32 - difference between primary key and
00:34 - unique key is that we only have one
00:37 - primary key per table and if you talk
00:40 - about unity then there can be multiple
00:43 - unity so let us open MySQL workbench let
00:58 - me create one table create table the
01:06 - name of the table example unique
01:20 - now first column is id integer the name
01:30 - where cur the length is let's say 50
01:38 - surname where K 50 also now let first
01:50 - assign primary key which will be a
01:54 - variety now
02:02 - I've hoped sorry name now I want name to
02:12 - be unique
02:13 - I don't want duplicate names in that
02:16 - particular column so I assign unique I
02:18 - height unique then in brackets I provide
02:24 - the name of the column okay let me fire
02:32 - it and refresh you here we have yeah
02:46 - columns let me see the structure of it
03:03 - okay this is the structure now I'm
03:07 - adding values in this table insert I
03:15 - have talked about all these SQL
03:18 - statement in our previous video so if
03:20 - you want to say this again then you can
03:25 - check out insert into the name of the
03:29 - table values already let's say one name
03:51 - surname then I insert it let me see
04:01 - select star from here you can see Wonder
04:11 - core has been inserted now now I'm
04:16 - adding another record but this pen ID
04:20 - will be unique because it's primary key
04:22 - and I try to insert the same name Smith
04:25 - and see what happens just use that
04:30 - insert into values let's set to here I
04:37 - change the surname to let's say start
04:45 - seawater insert into X unique values
04:51 - because I have applied unique key
04:53 - constraint in name it means that we
04:56 - cannot insert duplicate values in this
04:59 - column and hence we are inserting a
05:04 - duplicate values Smith Smith name has
05:08 - already inserted into the table so it
05:13 - won't allow us to insert this second
05:15 - time
05:16 - so this is how you can use the unique
05:19 - key constrain you can make unique key
05:22 - concern is your primary key also because
05:24 - unique key column always contain
05:28 - distinctive Alice thanks for watching
