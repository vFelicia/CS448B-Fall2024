00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use web view with your Android
00:09 - activity so let's take an example and
00:12 - let's uh see how we can use web view in
00:16 - our Android activity so first of all
00:19 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
00:21 - take a button and I will change its uh
00:24 - text
00:25 - to open URL okay and also I'm going to
00:32 - change its property which is layout
00:34 - colon width to fill parent so that it
00:39 - covers all the
00:41 - width now I'm going to uh take a text
00:46 - edit from here so go to the text field
00:50 - and take a text edit from here uh I'm
00:54 - going to take this plain text but uh you
00:57 - are free to choose other text
01:00 - uh view also or addit text also
01:04 - now this uh addit text also I'm going to
01:08 - change the property for the layout
01:10 - underscore width or layout colon width
01:14 - to fill parent okay so it uh fills the
01:18 - width now the most important thing we
01:22 - are going to use here is the web view so
01:25 - just search for a web view in the pallet
01:28 - and drag drop in into your
01:31 - activity and then you can resize your
01:34 - web View and you can change the property
01:38 - of this uh web view to fill parent so
01:42 - the layout width of this I'm going to uh
01:47 - change it to fill parent and the layout
01:50 - height also fill parent okay so it can
01:55 - cover all the
01:57 - remaining area of the activity
02:00 - now what I'm going to do is uh in this
02:04 - added text uh let's enter some default
02:07 - text so that we don't have to type a
02:10 - long URL for it for the first time so
02:14 - let's uh open for example
02:18 - google.com uh with this so I'm going to
02:21 - add the URL
02:25 - https
02:26 - colon double slash and then
02:32 - www.
02:37 - google.com
02:39 - Okay now uh we are ready to write the
02:42 - code for uh our activity so we will go
02:46 - to the Java and in the main activity.
02:50 - Java file we will first of all declare
02:54 - these variable which we have used so
02:57 - let's declare these variable
03:17 - okay so I have declared my all three
03:20 - variable one for button one for edit
03:23 - text and the last for web view now we
03:26 - are going to make a function for the
03:30 - button click event so let's make a
03:32 - function
03:35 - void or better public void public
03:42 - void
03:44 - open
03:46 - URL and then inside this function first
03:49 - of all we will cast our three variables
03:53 - which we have declared one is for button
03:55 - and edit text and
03:58 - browser
04:15 - so now we have declared all three
04:17 - variables or we have uh casted our all
04:20 - three variables and now we will add the
04:23 - button click event to our button
04:27 - variable so let's add a button click
04:30 - event button submit do set on click
04:35 - listener and here we will set a new
04:39 - onclick
04:40 - listener and inside this onclick um
04:43 - method we are going to write our code
04:48 - but first of all let's do uh the
04:50 - important uh one important thing so to
04:55 - open any uh URL or any web page you need
04:59 - need to provide the permission to open
05:03 - or to permission to use internet right
05:06 - so go to your manifest folder in your
05:08 - app folder and in here you will be able
05:11 - to see a folder called Android
05:14 - manifest.xml and in here you can set
05:17 - your permission so go just above your
05:23 - application element or tag and in here
05:26 - we will uh provide our permissions
05:31 - okay so in here what you need to do is
05:34 - you need to type this line of code which
05:39 - is in the angular brackets you need to
05:42 - add this tag called user minus
05:45 - permission and then give the name
05:49 - Android colon name is equal to in the
05:51 - quotes android. permission. internet
05:56 - okay so you need to add this extra line
05:59 - to your your Android manifest.xml
06:02 - file now everything is okay now we are
06:05 - ready to write some code for our onclick
06:11 - listener so let's take this uh browser
06:15 - and uh what we are going to do is first
06:18 - of all uh let's uh declare a
06:22 - string to get the URL okay so string URL
06:28 - is equal to and then we will take the
06:32 - text from the addit text so URL text do
06:38 - get
06:41 - text and then we will convert it to
06:44 - string and then this URL we can pass to
06:48 - our web view right now let's take this
06:52 - browser variable and let's uh set some
06:55 - properties to this uh browser so the
06:58 - first property we are going to add here
07:00 - is first of all get
07:05 - settings and then
07:08 - Set Let's uh Set uh the images loading
07:13 - of images so load image automatically is
07:16 - equal to
07:18 - true and the second property we are
07:21 - going to set is for the JavaScript so
07:24 - browser dot get
07:28 - settings and then dot
07:32 - set JavaScript enabled is equal to
07:37 - true and the third property we are going
07:40 - to set
07:42 - is for the scroll bar so
07:47 - browser dot set scroll bar style and
07:53 - then in here we will use this
07:57 - view dot so so we are going to set
08:00 - scroll
08:03 - bar scroll bar inside overlay so scroll
08:07 - bar inside overlay okay and now we can
08:13 - uh load some URL to our browser okay so
08:18 - what we are going to do is we can just
08:21 - call uh load URL function on our browser
08:26 - load URL and it takes us string as an
08:29 - argument and we have already extracted
08:32 - our string or URL from our edit text in
08:36 - this URL right so we can pass it
08:40 - here so now everything is done hopefully
08:44 - so just call this uh open URL function
08:48 - in your on create
08:50 - method and let's run our
08:56 - program so our program is running now
09:00 - and you can enter any URL in this added
09:04 - text our default URL is
09:09 - https
09:11 - www.g google.com so let's click this
09:14 - open URL button from here and let's see
09:18 - if it opens our URL yes it opens right
09:22 - so it opens our web page when we click
09:25 - the button and we can go back once again
09:29 - and we can just click it once again and
09:32 - it will open your URL in the web view so
09:37 - I hope you have enjoyed this video
