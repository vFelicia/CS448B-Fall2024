With timestamps:

00:00 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:02 - we can download node.js
00:04 - so just open your favorite browser and
00:07 - search for node.js and the first link
00:09 - which will appear here will be from
00:11 - nodejs.org so we are going to just click
00:13 - on this link
00:14 - now at the time of making this video you
00:16 - can see the latest version of node.js is
00:21 - 15.14.0 and the latest LTS version is
00:26 - 14.16.1 I generally choose the LTS
00:30 - version so I'm going to just click on
00:33 - this option which says
00:36 - 14.16.1 LTS which is going to download
00:39 - the MSI file for the node.js so once
00:44 - this MSI file is downloaded I'm going to
00:46 - just click on this MSI file and I'm
00:49 - going to minimize the browser and you
00:51 - can see this installation wizard for
00:55 - your node.js so I'm going to just click
00:58 - on next here you can read the license
01:01 - terms and conditions and then click on
01:03 - accept and then click on next this will
01:07 - be the location of your node.js
01:09 - installation so if you don't have the
01:11 - good reason to change this location just
01:13 - leave it as default and then click on
01:15 - next
01:16 - and then click on next and on the next
01:19 - window you can see uh this message which
01:22 - says tools for Native modules optionally
01:25 - install the tools necessary to compile
01:28 - native modules so I will definitely
01:31 - recommend you to check this checkbox
01:33 - which is going to automatically install
01:35 - the necessary tools and also it's going
01:38 - to install a tool called chocolaty which
01:42 - is very good utility and you can use
01:45 - this tool to install many other
01:48 - softwares also right so no harm in it
01:52 - I'm going to just click on next here and
01:54 - then click on install and now I'm going
01:56 - to click on yes which is going to start
01:59 - the installation process which is going
02:01 - to take few seconds so just wait for few
02:04 - seconds until the installation is
02:06 - finished so once the installation of
02:08 - node.js finishes on your Windows 10
02:11 - operating system you will be able to see
02:13 - this kind of message which says node.js
02:16 - has been success successfully installed
02:17 - so you can just click on finish button
02:20 - and this is going to open this kind of
02:22 - terminal and because we have chosen the
02:25 - option to install the additional tools
02:27 - it's going to just wait for us to press
02:30 - the enter button and when I press the
02:33 - enter button it's going to start the
02:35 - installation of the additional tools
02:38 - right so you can just wait for the
02:42 - installation of the additional tool for
02:45 - node.js and now you can just click on
02:47 - yes here which is going to open the
02:50 - Powershell and here you just need to
02:51 - press enter
02:53 - and it's going to adjust use the
02:57 - chocolatey uh installation to install
03:00 - the necessary tools right so you can see
03:03 - it's downloading this chocolaty first of
03:06 - all and then once this tool is installed
03:10 - it's going to download the additional
03:13 - node.js tools so you can leave this
03:16 - window uh like this you can just
03:18 - minimize it don't close this window and
03:21 - we can already move to the testing of
03:24 - node.js so when you click on this
03:28 - Windows icon here you will be able to
03:31 - see this node.js command prompt here
03:34 - also you can see the node.js option here
03:37 - both the option are going to open the
03:40 - command prompts so when you click on
03:42 - node.js command prompt it's going to
03:43 - open the command prompt like this let me
03:47 - just just change the font size so you
03:50 - can see everything in in bigger font let
03:55 - us say so I am going to just click on OK
03:57 - and the font size has been increased
04:01 - right so here you can just type node and
04:04 - then press enter which is going to open
04:07 - the node rapple so this kind of node
04:10 - rapple is very useful when you want to
04:12 - quickly test some commands and even you
04:16 - can test more complicated stuff so for
04:19 - example I'm going to just write
04:21 - console DOT log here and inside this
04:25 - parentheses I can add either double
04:29 - quotes or single quotes and then I can
04:32 - just type hello
04:33 - World here and then press enter which is
04:36 - going to just print hello world also you
04:39 - can do some basic arithmetic operations
04:42 - or you can import some modules here and
04:46 - test those modules so everything is
04:48 - possible using this terminal also if you
04:52 - want to open your Windows 10 command
04:55 - prompt you can just right click on the
04:58 - Windows icon here and you can open the
05:02 - Powershell from here and in the
05:04 - Powershell also you can just go to the
05:06 - properties and then you can change the
05:09 - font size from here and now you can just
05:13 - write node and then press enter which is
05:17 - going to open the node rapple utility
05:21 - also here in your Powershell or if you
05:24 - want to test this command in the command
05:27 - prompt of your Windows 10 you can just
05:29 - type CMD which is going to give you this
05:32 - command prompt option you can just click
05:34 - on this command prompt and then type
05:37 - node here which is going to once again
05:39 - open this kind of node Rebel environment
05:43 - which means you can test your node.js on
05:47 - the command prompt also and here also
05:50 - you can change the properties and then
05:52 - make the font size bigger and now you
05:56 - can see the font size in a bigger font
05:59 - now here you can press Ctrl C in order
06:03 - to come out of your node rapple here so
06:07 - you can see when you press Ctrl C it
06:10 - says press Ctrl C again in order to exit
06:14 - you can once again press Ctrl C and then
06:17 - you are out of the node reple
06:20 - environment also you can type dot exit
06:25 - to exit out also so when I type node
06:28 - once again when I want to exit out of
06:31 - the node I can just write dot X it which
06:34 - is also going to cancel the node rapid
06:37 - environment right and by the way if you
06:40 - are confused what is repel repl Rebel
06:45 - stands for read evaluate print Loop
06:49 - which is essentially an interactive
06:51 - shell which processes the node.js
06:54 - expressions and commands so this is how
06:57 - you can use node.js in the command
06:59 - prompt now generally when you want to
07:02 - write a node.js code you obviously need
07:05 - some kind of editor or IDE to write your
07:10 - node.js code I generally use Visual
07:12 - Studio code for developing my node.js
07:15 - applications but you can choose any
07:17 - other IDE or editor of your choice but
07:21 - for now what I'm going to do is I don't
07:24 - have any installation of any kind of
07:26 - editor here so I will show you if you
07:29 - don't have any editor on your Windows 10
07:32 - operating system the then also you can
07:34 - just write your node.js code but it will
07:38 - not be very convenient I would say so
07:42 - just go to the folder where you want to
07:44 - create your node.js file and then you
07:48 - can just click on view here and then
07:50 - click on file name extension so just
07:54 - check this option which is going to
07:55 - allow you to view the file extensions
07:59 - right now here right click and then you
08:03 - can click on new and then you can just
08:06 - click on text document and you can see
08:11 - that this document is created with
08:14 - DOT txt extension right so I'm going to
08:18 - just change the name of this file as
08:21 - Hello dot JS file so you generally write
08:25 - the node.js code in the dot JS files so
08:30 - I'm going to just press enter and on
08:32 - Windows 10 it's going to give you this
08:34 - kind of warning I'm going to just click
08:36 - on yes here which is going to create
08:38 - this hello.js file now you can edit this
08:42 - file by just right clicking on this file
08:45 - and then click on edit and here you can
08:49 - just search for the basic hello world
08:52 - node.js program online on the node.js
08:57 - website also I'm going to just put this
08:59 - link in the description in the getting
09:02 - started guide you will be able to see uh
09:06 - this sample code which you can test
09:08 - right so I'm going to just copy this
09:10 - sample code here and then I can just
09:14 - paste this code here basic basically
09:17 - what it's going to do is it's going to
09:20 - start your server on your local host and
09:26 - on your Port 3000 you just need to know
09:30 - this here so just press Ctrl s or you
09:35 - can just click on the file option and
09:37 - then click on Save once the project is
09:40 - saved just close this file so here go to
09:43 - the folder in which your hello.js file
09:47 - is there and then press shift key and
09:50 - then right click in the same folder
09:53 - which is going to allow you to open the
09:56 - command prompt or the Powershell in the
09:59 - same folder where your hello.js file is
10:03 - there so just choose this option which
10:05 - says open Powershell window here or you
10:08 - will see open command prompt here right
10:12 - both options are okay and now here you
10:15 - just need to write this command node and
10:18 - then the name of the file which is Hello
10:21 - dot JS right and then press enter which
10:25 - is going to start your node.js server on
10:30 - this IP address and this port which is
10:34 - essentially localhost 3000 so once again
10:37 - you can go to your web browser and then
10:40 - just type
10:44 - 127.0.0.1 and then colon
10:47 - 3000 and then press enter which is going
10:50 - to show you hello world that means your
10:53 - node.js server is working fine and this
10:57 - is how you can write your node.js code
11:00 - and execute the dot JS file and also we
11:04 - are going to see how we can set up our
11:07 - Visual Studio code editor for developing
11:11 - node.js applications so let's get
11:14 - started so first of all open your
11:16 - favorite browser and search for visual
11:19 - studio code and the first link which
11:20 - will appear here will be from
11:23 - code.visualstudio.com so we are going to
11:24 - just click on this link
11:27 - and straight away you will be able to
11:30 - see the download button here and on the
11:33 - top so I'm going to just click on this
11:36 - button which is going to download the
11:39 - executable file for the visual studio
11:42 - code setup at the time of making this
11:45 - video this file is about 68.9 megabytes
11:49 - so I will wait for some time so once
11:51 - this executable file is downloaded I'm
11:53 - going to just click on this file and I'm
11:55 - going to minimize my browser and now the
11:58 - visual studio setup has been started so
12:01 - I'm going to just check this radio
12:04 - button which says I accept the agreement
12:07 - and then click on next this will be the
12:10 - location where your Visual Studio code
12:12 - editor will be installed so if you don't
12:16 - have the good reason to change it just
12:18 - leave it as default and then click on
12:19 - next
12:21 - and then just click on next once again
12:24 - and now you can check these check boxes
12:28 - you can create a desktop icon for visual
12:32 - studio code let's check it also some
12:34 - other options are available here for
12:37 - example add open with code action to
12:41 - Windows Explorer File context menu I
12:44 - will check it this one also and register
12:47 - Visual Studio code as an editor for
12:50 - supported file type so I will also check
12:54 - this check box so basically I checked
12:56 - all the check boxes here and then click
12:58 - on next and then click on install which
13:00 - is going to start the installation of
13:02 - Visual Studio code and now once Visual
13:05 - Studio code has been installed we are
13:07 - going to see this message just leave
13:09 - this checkbox checked and click on the
13:13 - Finish button which is going to launch
13:14 - Visual Studio code on your Windows 10
13:17 - operating system and from here you can
13:19 - customize visual Studio code for
13:22 - different languages also you have the
13:25 - settings and key bindings for different
13:28 - editors like Bim Sublime atom and others
13:32 - and you have all these other settings
13:35 - from here so we will discuss them later
13:39 - when we develop some code from here let
13:43 - me show you some basic things about
13:46 - Visual Studio code so for example I open
13:50 - my command prompt by just typing CMD and
13:54 - then I will just navigate to my desktop
14:00 - folder and now I'm in my desktops folder
14:04 - right so let's say I want to open Visual
14:07 - Studio code in my desktop folder I can
14:11 - just write code here and then space dot
14:16 - which is going to open Visual Studio
14:18 - code in the current Direct directory in
14:22 - which you are currently present so right
14:24 - now I want to open Visual Studio code
14:27 - inside this directory so just write code
14:30 - space Dot and then press enter and when
14:34 - you press enter here it's going to open
14:36 - Visual Studio code and you can see the
14:40 - folder which is opened here is the
14:44 - desktop folder right so this is the
14:48 - command if you just type code here then
14:52 - and it's going to open the folder which
14:55 - you are working on the last time when
14:58 - you closed your Visual Studio code right
15:01 - so we opened last time this desktop
15:06 - folder that's why when you just type
15:09 - code then it's going to just open the
15:12 - last opened folder and close this
15:15 - terminal also so now let's say I will go
15:19 - to my documents folder and here I will
15:22 - create a new folder and I will name it
15:27 - as
15:28 - workspace so I will just name it as
15:31 - workspace here and then I will go inside
15:35 - this workspace folder and then I will
15:38 - press my shift key on my Windows
15:41 - operating system so press shift key and
15:44 - then right click inside this folder so
15:47 - press shift key and then right click and
15:51 - you will be able to see open with code
15:54 - option here so you can just choose this
15:56 - option which is going to open your
15:59 - Visual Studio code in the workspace
16:02 - directory now let's try to create a very
16:04 - basic Javascript file here so I'm going
16:07 - to just click on this icon which says
16:10 - new file and then I'm going to name my
16:13 - file as Hello dot JS and here we can
16:18 - write our code for example I'm going to
16:21 - just write const and I'm going to name
16:26 - my variable as X let's say and then I am
16:30 - going to give some value to it okay and
16:33 - then I'm going to provide semicolon and
16:36 - I just want to print the value of this
16:39 - variable which is X so I can just write
16:43 - console DOT log and then I will just
16:47 - pass X inside these parentheses so you
16:52 - might have observed that Visual Studio
16:54 - code already comes with the support for
16:57 - JavaScript and node.js so you can see at
17:00 - the bottom it recognizes the file type
17:04 - and when I type let's say console here
17:08 - it gives me the intellisense for
17:12 - completing this code which I am writing
17:16 - right so it knows the file name and it
17:21 - knows what I am trying to do inside this
17:25 - file I can press Ctrl s to save my file
17:29 - now you can open the terminal inside the
17:34 - visual studio code itself so you don't
17:36 - need to type CMD to open the command
17:39 - prompt and execute this code I can just
17:42 - click on Terminal and then click on new
17:44 - terminal which is going to open the
17:47 - terminal in my visual studio code itself
17:51 - and it's going to open the terminal in
17:55 - the directory in which I am currently
17:57 - working so this is the workspace
18:01 - directory now one more cool feature
18:04 - about Visual Studio code is you can see
18:07 - that this font size is little bit
18:10 - smaller so I can just press control and
18:14 - then plus and what it does is basically
18:17 - it's going to increase the font size and
18:21 - the size of all the widgets inside
18:23 - Visual Studio code so I can once again
18:26 - press Ctrl plus and you can see now this
18:32 - font size is bigger terminal size is
18:34 - also bigger so in this way you can
18:37 - change the font size if you want to
18:40 - reduce the size then press Ctrl minus
18:43 - okay so when you press Ctrl minus then
18:47 - it's going to reduce the size of all the
18:49 - widgets and the font now we have already
18:52 - installed node.js on our Windows
18:54 - operating system so what we can do is we
18:57 - can just write node and the name of the
19:00 - file which is Hello dot JS and then
19:03 - press enter and it's going to print the
19:05 - value of x which is my first app so you
19:09 - can write your code run your code within
19:13 - your Visual Studio code so you don't
19:15 - have to leave Visual Studio code to run
19:18 - your applications now Visual Studio code
19:21 - have some really cool features for
19:24 - example you can search for some text
19:27 - inside the several files let's say I
19:31 - just want to search for my if my project
19:34 - contains many file let's say 100 files
19:37 - then it's going to search for my keyword
19:41 - in all the 100 files and it's going to
19:43 - show me the result right so I can see
19:46 - here
19:48 - my keyword is written so it's search and
19:53 - show me I can also replace my with any
19:56 - other word let's say above and then
19:59 - press on this replace all button which
20:03 - is going to just replace this my with
20:06 - our keyword let's say now visual studio
20:09 - also have a good integration with Source
20:12 - control so if you have git installed
20:15 - it's going to recognize that you have
20:17 - get installed and it's going to show you
20:20 - if you want to commit your files or you
20:23 - have some uncommitted files so whenever
20:26 - you change your code in your project
20:28 - git is going to track your code and with
20:33 - the help of this Source control section
20:36 - you will be able to see what all files
20:40 - are added or what or for all files are
20:43 - uncommitted so you can commit them and
20:46 - you can push them from this section you
20:50 - also have the debug option so visual
20:53 - studio comes with the debugger for
20:55 - node.js already
20:57 - so you can see to customize and run
21:00 - debug create a launch dot Json file so
21:06 - when you just click on the run and debug
21:09 - button you will see that it's going to
21:13 - give us the option to choose from these
21:18 - options we want to debug this for
21:23 - node.js so I can just select node.js
21:26 - from here and then our code is going to
21:30 - be debugged inside our Visual Studio
21:33 - code so right now it just prints our
21:37 - first app which is this value of x let
21:41 - us say I just want to create a
21:45 - breakpoint here so here on the console
21:48 - log I just created a breakpoint and
21:50 - whenever you create a breakpoint in your
21:55 - file you will track all your break
21:58 - points under this section so if you have
22:01 - multiple breakpoints you can see what
22:05 - all files contain breakpoints and when
22:07 - you click on this you will directly go
22:11 - to the breakpoint you also have toggle
22:14 - active breakpoint which means that you
22:18 - can disable all the active breakpoints
22:21 - using this option also you can remove
22:24 - all the breakpoints using this option
22:28 - now once again let's debug our code so
22:32 - I'm going to just press run and debug
22:36 - and then once again choose node.js
22:40 - and once I do this you can see
22:43 - here because I have created a breakpoint
22:47 - here in my code execution is stopped at
22:51 - my break point and here I can visualize
22:55 - the local variables and other stuff
22:59 - right so when I hover over on X I can
23:03 - see the value of x which is the feature
23:07 - available using the node debugger also
23:12 - if your code contains multiple lines you
23:15 - can press on this button to continue
23:19 - you can press this option for stepping
23:22 - over you can go or step into the code
23:26 - you can step out of the code and also
23:29 - you can restart your debugger using this
23:33 - button and you can stop debugging using
23:36 - this button right so these all things we
23:39 - are going to see here ah in the later
23:41 - videos when we write some actual code
23:44 - but I just want to show you how powerful
23:47 - this Visual Studio editor is right the
23:52 - last section here is for the extensions
23:55 - so whatever language you are working in
23:59 - Visual Studio code have extension for
24:03 - most probably everything because it has
24:07 - a very strong Community Support let me
24:10 - just stop the debugger debugger so as I
24:13 - said Visual Studio code already comes
24:16 - with the support for node.js but if you
24:19 - want to search some more cool extensions
24:22 - related to node.js you can just type
24:25 - node here and then it's going to give
24:29 - you some options related to the node.js
24:32 - so let's say I just press on this option
24:35 - which says node debug and you can also
24:38 - see how many stars this project have and
24:43 - how many downloads this extension have
24:47 - and here you will be able to get more
24:49 - information about this
24:52 - extension so you can see this extension
24:56 - is from Microsoft and it has been
24:59 - downloaded around 200 000 times and it
25:03 - has good rating of 5 right so you can
25:07 - decide based upon this if you want to
25:11 - download this extension or not so by
25:14 - default uh Visual Studio code comes with
25:17 - node debug extension that's why I can
25:21 - disable this from here let's say if I
25:25 - choose some other extension I have the
25:27 - option to install it so I can just click
25:30 - on install which is going to install
25:33 - this extension inside my visual studio
25:35 - code I can uninstall this extension and
25:39 - also I can disable this extension if I
25:42 - have installed the extension so there
25:46 - are many cool extensions here but we
25:49 - will install them whenever we need them
25:52 - right so we will go step by step and we
25:56 - are going to install them step by step
25:59 - when we need these extensions so this is
26:03 - how you can download and install Visual
26:05 - Studio code and set up your node.js
26:08 - development environment on Visual Studio
26:11 - code I hope you've enjoyed this video
26:14 - and I will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so let's get started and let's see how we can download node.js so just open your favorite browser and search for node.js and the first link which will appear here will be from nodejs.org so we are going to just click on this link now at the time of making this video you can see the latest version of node.js is 15.14.0 and the latest LTS version is 14.16.1 I generally choose the LTS version so I'm going to just click on this option which says 14.16.1 LTS which is going to download the MSI file for the node.js so once this MSI file is downloaded I'm going to just click on this MSI file and I'm going to minimize the browser and you can see this installation wizard for your node.js so I'm going to just click on next here you can read the license terms and conditions and then click on accept and then click on next this will be the location of your node.js installation so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and then click on next and then click on next and on the next window you can see uh this message which says tools for Native modules optionally install the tools necessary to compile native modules so I will definitely recommend you to check this checkbox which is going to automatically install the necessary tools and also it's going to install a tool called chocolaty which is very good utility and you can use this tool to install many other softwares also right so no harm in it I'm going to just click on next here and then click on install and now I'm going to click on yes which is going to start the installation process which is going to take few seconds so just wait for few seconds until the installation is finished so once the installation of node.js finishes on your Windows 10 operating system you will be able to see this kind of message which says node.js has been success successfully installed so you can just click on finish button and this is going to open this kind of terminal and because we have chosen the option to install the additional tools it's going to just wait for us to press the enter button and when I press the enter button it's going to start the installation of the additional tools right so you can just wait for the installation of the additional tool for node.js and now you can just click on yes here which is going to open the Powershell and here you just need to press enter and it's going to adjust use the chocolatey uh installation to install the necessary tools right so you can see it's downloading this chocolaty first of all and then once this tool is installed it's going to download the additional node.js tools so you can leave this window uh like this you can just minimize it don't close this window and we can already move to the testing of node.js so when you click on this Windows icon here you will be able to see this node.js command prompt here also you can see the node.js option here both the option are going to open the command prompts so when you click on node.js command prompt it's going to open the command prompt like this let me just just change the font size so you can see everything in in bigger font let us say so I am going to just click on OK and the font size has been increased right so here you can just type node and then press enter which is going to open the node rapple so this kind of node rapple is very useful when you want to quickly test some commands and even you can test more complicated stuff so for example I'm going to just write console DOT log here and inside this parentheses I can add either double quotes or single quotes and then I can just type hello World here and then press enter which is going to just print hello world also you can do some basic arithmetic operations or you can import some modules here and test those modules so everything is possible using this terminal also if you want to open your Windows 10 command prompt you can just right click on the Windows icon here and you can open the Powershell from here and in the Powershell also you can just go to the properties and then you can change the font size from here and now you can just write node and then press enter which is going to open the node rapple utility also here in your Powershell or if you want to test this command in the command prompt of your Windows 10 you can just type CMD which is going to give you this command prompt option you can just click on this command prompt and then type node here which is going to once again open this kind of node Rebel environment which means you can test your node.js on the command prompt also and here also you can change the properties and then make the font size bigger and now you can see the font size in a bigger font now here you can press Ctrl C in order to come out of your node rapple here so you can see when you press Ctrl C it says press Ctrl C again in order to exit you can once again press Ctrl C and then you are out of the node reple environment also you can type dot exit to exit out also so when I type node once again when I want to exit out of the node I can just write dot X it which is also going to cancel the node rapid environment right and by the way if you are confused what is repel repl Rebel stands for read evaluate print Loop which is essentially an interactive shell which processes the node.js expressions and commands so this is how you can use node.js in the command prompt now generally when you want to write a node.js code you obviously need some kind of editor or IDE to write your node.js code I generally use Visual Studio code for developing my node.js applications but you can choose any other IDE or editor of your choice but for now what I'm going to do is I don't have any installation of any kind of editor here so I will show you if you don't have any editor on your Windows 10 operating system the then also you can just write your node.js code but it will not be very convenient I would say so just go to the folder where you want to create your node.js file and then you can just click on view here and then click on file name extension so just check this option which is going to allow you to view the file extensions right now here right click and then you can click on new and then you can just click on text document and you can see that this document is created with DOT txt extension right so I'm going to just change the name of this file as Hello dot JS file so you generally write the node.js code in the dot JS files so I'm going to just press enter and on Windows 10 it's going to give you this kind of warning I'm going to just click on yes here which is going to create this hello.js file now you can edit this file by just right clicking on this file and then click on edit and here you can just search for the basic hello world node.js program online on the node.js website also I'm going to just put this link in the description in the getting started guide you will be able to see uh this sample code which you can test right so I'm going to just copy this sample code here and then I can just paste this code here basic basically what it's going to do is it's going to start your server on your local host and on your Port 3000 you just need to know this here so just press Ctrl s or you can just click on the file option and then click on Save once the project is saved just close this file so here go to the folder in which your hello.js file is there and then press shift key and then right click in the same folder which is going to allow you to open the command prompt or the Powershell in the same folder where your hello.js file is there so just choose this option which says open Powershell window here or you will see open command prompt here right both options are okay and now here you just need to write this command node and then the name of the file which is Hello dot JS right and then press enter which is going to start your node.js server on this IP address and this port which is essentially localhost 3000 so once again you can go to your web browser and then just type 127.0.0.1 and then colon 3000 and then press enter which is going to show you hello world that means your node.js server is working fine and this is how you can write your node.js code and execute the dot JS file and also we are going to see how we can set up our Visual Studio code editor for developing node.js applications so let's get started so first of all open your favorite browser and search for visual studio code and the first link which will appear here will be from code.visualstudio.com so we are going to just click on this link and straight away you will be able to see the download button here and on the top so I'm going to just click on this button which is going to download the executable file for the visual studio code setup at the time of making this video this file is about 68.9 megabytes so I will wait for some time so once this executable file is downloaded I'm going to just click on this file and I'm going to minimize my browser and now the visual studio setup has been started so I'm going to just check this radio button which says I accept the agreement and then click on next this will be the location where your Visual Studio code editor will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and then click on next and then just click on next once again and now you can check these check boxes you can create a desktop icon for visual studio code let's check it also some other options are available here for example add open with code action to Windows Explorer File context menu I will check it this one also and register Visual Studio code as an editor for supported file type so I will also check this check box so basically I checked all the check boxes here and then click on next and then click on install which is going to start the installation of Visual Studio code and now once Visual Studio code has been installed we are going to see this message just leave this checkbox checked and click on the Finish button which is going to launch Visual Studio code on your Windows 10 operating system and from here you can customize visual Studio code for different languages also you have the settings and key bindings for different editors like Bim Sublime atom and others and you have all these other settings from here so we will discuss them later when we develop some code from here let me show you some basic things about Visual Studio code so for example I open my command prompt by just typing CMD and then I will just navigate to my desktop folder and now I'm in my desktops folder right so let's say I want to open Visual Studio code in my desktop folder I can just write code here and then space dot which is going to open Visual Studio code in the current Direct directory in which you are currently present so right now I want to open Visual Studio code inside this directory so just write code space Dot and then press enter and when you press enter here it's going to open Visual Studio code and you can see the folder which is opened here is the desktop folder right so this is the command if you just type code here then and it's going to open the folder which you are working on the last time when you closed your Visual Studio code right so we opened last time this desktop folder that's why when you just type code then it's going to just open the last opened folder and close this terminal also so now let's say I will go to my documents folder and here I will create a new folder and I will name it as workspace so I will just name it as workspace here and then I will go inside this workspace folder and then I will press my shift key on my Windows operating system so press shift key and then right click inside this folder so press shift key and then right click and you will be able to see open with code option here so you can just choose this option which is going to open your Visual Studio code in the workspace directory now let's try to create a very basic Javascript file here so I'm going to just click on this icon which says new file and then I'm going to name my file as Hello dot JS and here we can write our code for example I'm going to just write const and I'm going to name my variable as X let's say and then I am going to give some value to it okay and then I'm going to provide semicolon and I just want to print the value of this variable which is X so I can just write console DOT log and then I will just pass X inside these parentheses so you might have observed that Visual Studio code already comes with the support for JavaScript and node.js so you can see at the bottom it recognizes the file type and when I type let's say console here it gives me the intellisense for completing this code which I am writing right so it knows the file name and it knows what I am trying to do inside this file I can press Ctrl s to save my file now you can open the terminal inside the visual studio code itself so you don't need to type CMD to open the command prompt and execute this code I can just click on Terminal and then click on new terminal which is going to open the terminal in my visual studio code itself and it's going to open the terminal in the directory in which I am currently working so this is the workspace directory now one more cool feature about Visual Studio code is you can see that this font size is little bit smaller so I can just press control and then plus and what it does is basically it's going to increase the font size and the size of all the widgets inside Visual Studio code so I can once again press Ctrl plus and you can see now this font size is bigger terminal size is also bigger so in this way you can change the font size if you want to reduce the size then press Ctrl minus okay so when you press Ctrl minus then it's going to reduce the size of all the widgets and the font now we have already installed node.js on our Windows operating system so what we can do is we can just write node and the name of the file which is Hello dot JS and then press enter and it's going to print the value of x which is my first app so you can write your code run your code within your Visual Studio code so you don't have to leave Visual Studio code to run your applications now Visual Studio code have some really cool features for example you can search for some text inside the several files let's say I just want to search for my if my project contains many file let's say 100 files then it's going to search for my keyword in all the 100 files and it's going to show me the result right so I can see here my keyword is written so it's search and show me I can also replace my with any other word let's say above and then press on this replace all button which is going to just replace this my with our keyword let's say now visual studio also have a good integration with Source control so if you have git installed it's going to recognize that you have get installed and it's going to show you if you want to commit your files or you have some uncommitted files so whenever you change your code in your project git is going to track your code and with the help of this Source control section you will be able to see what all files are added or what or for all files are uncommitted so you can commit them and you can push them from this section you also have the debug option so visual studio comes with the debugger for node.js already so you can see to customize and run debug create a launch dot Json file so when you just click on the run and debug button you will see that it's going to give us the option to choose from these options we want to debug this for node.js so I can just select node.js from here and then our code is going to be debugged inside our Visual Studio code so right now it just prints our first app which is this value of x let us say I just want to create a breakpoint here so here on the console log I just created a breakpoint and whenever you create a breakpoint in your file you will track all your break points under this section so if you have multiple breakpoints you can see what all files contain breakpoints and when you click on this you will directly go to the breakpoint you also have toggle active breakpoint which means that you can disable all the active breakpoints using this option also you can remove all the breakpoints using this option now once again let's debug our code so I'm going to just press run and debug and then once again choose node.js and once I do this you can see here because I have created a breakpoint here in my code execution is stopped at my break point and here I can visualize the local variables and other stuff right so when I hover over on X I can see the value of x which is the feature available using the node debugger also if your code contains multiple lines you can press on this button to continue you can press this option for stepping over you can go or step into the code you can step out of the code and also you can restart your debugger using this button and you can stop debugging using this button right so these all things we are going to see here ah in the later videos when we write some actual code but I just want to show you how powerful this Visual Studio editor is right the last section here is for the extensions so whatever language you are working in Visual Studio code have extension for most probably everything because it has a very strong Community Support let me just stop the debugger debugger so as I said Visual Studio code already comes with the support for node.js but if you want to search some more cool extensions related to node.js you can just type node here and then it's going to give you some options related to the node.js so let's say I just press on this option which says node debug and you can also see how many stars this project have and how many downloads this extension have and here you will be able to get more information about this extension so you can see this extension is from Microsoft and it has been downloaded around 200 000 times and it has good rating of 5 right so you can decide based upon this if you want to download this extension or not so by default uh Visual Studio code comes with node debug extension that's why I can disable this from here let's say if I choose some other extension I have the option to install it so I can just click on install which is going to install this extension inside my visual studio code I can uninstall this extension and also I can disable this extension if I have installed the extension so there are many cool extensions here but we will install them whenever we need them right so we will go step by step and we are going to install them step by step when we need these extensions so this is how you can download and install Visual Studio code and set up your node.js development environment on Visual Studio code I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
