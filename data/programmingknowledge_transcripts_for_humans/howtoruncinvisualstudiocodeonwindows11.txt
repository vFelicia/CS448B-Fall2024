00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set up C support on your
00:04 - Visual Studio code editor on your
00:07 - windows 11 operating system
00:09 - so for this you will need two things
00:12 - first one is obvious which is Visual
00:15 - Studio code so if you haven't installed
00:18 - Visual Studio code I will recommend you
00:20 - to install it it's a very easy and
00:23 - simple process and if you don't know how
00:25 - to install Visual Studio code I will put
00:27 - the link of the video in which I have
00:28 - shown how you can install and use Visual
00:31 - Studio code
00:32 - and once you have Visual Studio code we
00:35 - need a second tool which is called a
00:39 - compiler right so a compiler will help
00:42 - you to compile your CNC plus code on any
00:46 - operating system so for Windows we are
00:49 - going to install the Min GW compiler so
00:52 - let's start with that so first of all
00:55 - open your favorite browser and search
00:57 - for bin GW and in the search result you
01:00 - will see some websites so don't click on
01:03 - the first website which you will see
01:05 - here which is from Source Forge you need
01:08 - to open this website which says Min GW
01:11 - hyphen
01:14 - w64.org so just click on this link which
01:17 - says Min GW hyphen w64.org
01:22 - and once this website opens you will be
01:25 - able to see the overview here and on
01:27 - this website you can click on the
01:29 - downloads link here
01:31 - so here you will be able to see all the
01:34 - download link for bin GW for different
01:37 - operating systems so the one we are
01:39 - looking for is the windows version so we
01:42 - are going to click on this link which
01:44 - says Min GW w64 builds so just click on
01:48 - this link which is going to open this
01:51 - kind of window again and from here you
01:54 - can download the Min GW builds from
01:56 - Source Force so you need to click on
01:58 - this link now right
02:01 - so Source forged link was shown directly
02:04 - in the search result but you need to go
02:07 - through this website in order to come to
02:09 - this website and once you are redirected
02:12 - to the sourceforge.net website you will
02:15 - see that Min GW 64-bit installer exe
02:19 - file will be downloaded on your windows
02:21 - 11 operating system so once this file is
02:24 - downloaded I'm going to click on this
02:26 - file and then you will see this warning
02:29 - which says do you want to allow this app
02:31 - from unknown publisher to make changes
02:34 - on your device I trust this so I will
02:37 - click on yes here and I'm going to
02:39 - minimize this browser
02:41 - and you can see Min GW installer has
02:44 - been started on my windows 11 operating
02:47 - system so on the first window I just
02:49 - need to click on next here which is
02:51 - going to start the installation here you
02:55 - can choose the version for Min GW so I'm
02:59 - going to choose the top most option
03:01 - which is 8.1.0 at the time of making
03:04 - this video you can also choose the
03:06 - architecture I'm going to choose
03:08 - x8664 and then you can choose the
03:12 - threads so generally for Threads I
03:15 - always choose posix but you can also
03:17 - choose win32 also also exception you
03:21 - have two options I will leave it as
03:24 - default and then you have the build
03:26 - revision I will leave it as default also
03:29 - and then click on next
03:31 - and this will be the location where your
03:34 - Min GW compiler will be installed so you
03:37 - can see it will be installed in the
03:41 - program files Min GW directory will be
03:44 - created and then this folder will be
03:47 - created right so if you don't have the
03:50 - good reason to change this location just
03:52 - leave it as default and also you can
03:54 - leave this checkbox as checked which is
03:57 - going to create a shortcut for your Min
03:59 - GW compiler tool so I'm going to click
04:02 - on next now which is going to start the
04:04 - download of all the files and packages
04:07 - for your mingw tools so just wait for
04:12 - this process to reach to the 100 Mark so
04:14 - now after some time I can see this
04:16 - window which says click next to continue
04:18 - the installation so I'm going to click
04:20 - on the next
04:21 - and now I can see this message which
04:24 - says Min GW has been successfully
04:26 - installed and I can click on finish to
04:29 - complete the installation so let me
04:30 - click on the Finish button so once I
04:33 - click on the Finish button Min GW is
04:36 - installed on my Windows operating
04:38 - systems so now once mingw is installed
04:41 - first of all we need to know the
04:43 - location where Min GW is installed so at
04:46 - the time of installation you might have
04:48 - noted the location so let me show you
04:51 - the default location where Min GW will
04:53 - be installed so you need to go inside
04:55 - the C directory and then go inside
04:58 - program files and then you will be able
05:01 - to see this Min GW hyphen W 64 bit
05:06 - folder here and then this folder will be
05:09 - there so this is the location where Min
05:12 - GW is installed then you need to go
05:15 - inside Min gw64 and here under the bin
05:20 - folder you will see all the files which
05:24 - will help you to compile your C or C
05:26 - plus plus programs okay so go until the
05:29 - bin folder right and you need to copy
05:32 - this path now we need to set the
05:35 - environment variable for Min GW so that
05:37 - we can use GCC or G plus plus command on
05:41 - our Windows command prompt or Powershell
05:44 - or terminal
05:45 - so for that what you need to do you just
05:48 - need to click on search and then search
05:50 - for edit EnV and it's going to show you
05:54 - this result which says edit environment
05:56 - variables for your account and you can
05:58 - see this window is going to open right
06:01 - now if you can't find this edit
06:05 - environment variable window using the
06:07 - search option then you can always open
06:10 - the control panel and then once control
06:13 - panel opens you need to view by category
06:16 - here and then click on system and
06:18 - security and then once again click on
06:20 - system here which is going to open the
06:22 - settings app and here it's going to show
06:25 - you an about section this link which
06:28 - says Advanced system settings
06:31 - so just click on that and then click on
06:33 - environment variables which is also
06:35 - going to open the same window so you can
06:38 - choose any one of the method so once
06:41 - this environment variables window opens
06:43 - select path under system variables and
06:46 - then click on edit and then click on new
06:49 - here okay so it's going to allow you to
06:53 - add a new environment variable and then
06:56 - just copy the path
06:59 - until the bin folder inside your Min
07:03 - gw64 bit folder okay so this path is
07:07 - until bin folder okay and once you
07:10 - copied it you can just add this path
07:14 - here inside your environment variables
07:17 - and then just press enter which is going
07:19 - to add your path and then click OK here
07:22 - and then click OK and then once again
07:25 - click on OK and now you can close all
07:28 - the windows here and now we can test our
07:31 - GCC and G plus plus versions and
07:35 - commands right so you can open the
07:38 - command prompt by just pressing CMD and
07:42 - then open the command prompt from the
07:44 - result and once the command prompt is
07:46 - open here you can just write GCC space
07:50 - hyphen hyphen version and then press
07:54 - enter and if you see some result which
07:55 - looks like this that means GCC command
07:59 - is working successfully on your windows
08:02 - 11 operating system similarly you can
08:04 - also check the G plus plus command which
08:06 - is also used to compile your C plus plus
08:07 - programs so it's also going to show you
08:10 - this kind of result here so once you see
08:13 - this kind of result that means your GCC
08:15 - and G plus plus commands are working so
08:17 - once you have bin GW compiler and visual
08:20 - studio code on your Windows operating
08:22 - system let's create a c program and
08:25 - let's see how we can set up a c program
08:28 - with Visual Studio code
08:31 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
08:33 - create a folder on my desktop you can
08:36 - create a folder at any location on your
08:41 - Windows operating system so that let me
08:43 - right click here and then let me just
08:46 - select new and then create a new folder
08:49 - I'm going to name my folder as C
08:53 - apps and then press enter and then I'm
08:56 - going to go inside this c apps folder
09:00 - then I can right click on this folder
09:06 - and then I can click on show more option
09:09 - and I can see this open with code option
09:12 - so I can just click on open with code
09:15 - which is going to open Visual Studio
09:18 - code in this folder okay so you can see
09:23 - see apps is open right here you can just
09:28 - click on I trust the author and you can
09:32 - see the c apps folder has been opened on
09:36 - Visual Studio code right you can do that
09:40 - or if you are a fan of command line you
09:45 - can open the command line so right click
09:47 - here and then click on open in terminal
09:51 - and once the terminal opens you can even
09:56 - open the visual studio code in this c
10:01 - apps folder by just writing code space
10:05 - dot this means I want to open the visual
10:08 - studio code in the current directory so
10:11 - I am going to press enter which is also
10:14 - going to open Visual Studio code in the
10:17 - current directory in which I am present
10:21 - so right now I am present in the c apps
10:23 - folder and that is what it's going to
10:26 - open in Visual Studio code
10:28 - now inside the c apps let me create a
10:32 - very simple C file so I'm going to click
10:35 - on this new file button I can even click
10:38 - on file and then click on new file
10:41 - and
10:43 - from here
10:45 - I can create a new file right so let me
10:48 - just create a file by clicking on this
10:52 - new file button and then I'm going to
10:54 - name my file as main dot C and then
10:58 - press enter
10:59 - now as soon as I just create a main.c
11:04 - file you are going to see some kind of
11:07 - notification pair Visual Studio code is
11:10 - going to detect that you want to create
11:13 - a CR program and it is going to suggest
11:16 - you to install the related C or C plus
11:19 - plus extensions if it doesn't show any
11:23 - suggestions you can always go to the
11:27 - extension tab so just click on this
11:29 - extensions Tab and then search for C and
11:34 - C plus plus ok so C forward slash C plus
11:38 - plus and once you
11:42 - search for C and C plus plus the top ah
11:45 - extension here is from Microsoft you can
11:48 - see you can just select here this
11:51 - extension and then in your case you are
11:53 - going to see the install option I have
11:56 - already installed this extension in your
11:59 - case you are going to see the install
12:01 - button here so you just need to click on
12:03 - install so this C and C plus plus
12:06 - extension from Microsoft which is the
12:08 - developer for visual studio code
12:11 - is going to run your C or C plus plus
12:15 - program is going to help you to ah debug
12:19 - or browse your COC plus program and it
12:22 - is going to also give the intellisense
12:25 - capability in your C or C plus plus
12:28 - program so just install this and once
12:31 - you have installed this all the features
12:35 - of this extension will be available on
12:39 - your Visual Studio code editor you can
12:41 - also see you have other extensions like
12:45 - C or C plus plus themes here
12:48 - so it's going to look like this so
12:51 - whatever extensions you can see are
12:54 - related to C or C plus plus I will
12:56 - suggest you to install all of them they
12:59 - are going to help you to better run your
13:02 - C or C plus plus programs on Windows
13:06 - operating system in Visual Studio code
13:08 - right now you can see
13:10 - reload is required for this extra
13:13 - extension so I can just click on read
13:16 - load and it's going to uh reload my
13:19 - visual studio code so now let me just go
13:23 - to this Explorer section here where I
13:26 - have created the main.c file I can write
13:30 - a very simple C program here
13:33 - which is going to ask for two numbers
13:36 - and it is going to just add these two
13:38 - numbers and show us the result right
13:40 - this is a very simple program you can
13:43 - find anywhere on the internet
13:46 - now in order to run this program what
13:50 - you can do
13:51 - you can either click on this terminal
13:54 - and open a new terminal and using GCC
13:57 - you can run your C program which is by
14:02 - just using the normal terminal command
14:05 - right you can also
14:09 - create a build task here so you can see
14:12 - there is this ah
14:15 - option called run build task so I'm
14:19 - going to click on this run build task
14:21 - and it's going to give me the suggestion
14:25 - which build task I want to create here
14:28 - it says GCC dot exe because I have
14:32 - created the C file and visual studio
14:36 - code is going to recognize that this is
14:39 - a C file and that's why it's giving us
14:41 - this gcc.exe option so I am going to
14:44 - just click on this
14:45 - which is going to start building my
14:49 - program you can see starting build
14:52 - and you can see the build is successful
14:56 - so my C program has been compiled
14:59 - successfully and you can see main.exe
15:03 - file has been created once the build is
15:06 - complete
15:07 - you can even run this GCC command in
15:12 - your terminal by opening a new terminal
15:16 - so you can click on this plus sign
15:19 - and it's going to open the default
15:21 - command prompt in my case it's
15:23 - Powershell
15:24 - you can even open the command prompt
15:27 - from here so you can see
15:29 - this is the command prompt so you can
15:31 - either use Powershell or command prompt
15:34 - to compile your program also right I
15:37 - have used this inbuilt capability of
15:41 - Visual Studio code to build my program
15:43 - let me show you how you can build the
15:45 - program using the command line also so
15:48 - here I can write GCC dot exe and then I
15:52 - can give the name of my main dot C file
15:55 - so let me give the name of my file and
15:58 - then hyphen o and then the name of my
16:02 - output file which will be the executable
16:04 - file so I can name it as Main 2
16:09 - dot exe file for example right main exe
16:13 - file is already created by this GCC
16:16 - build
16:17 - option so I can create a second exe file
16:21 - and I can run this and you can see this
16:24 - main2.gcc file is created
16:26 - now in order to run these exe files
16:30 - these exe files are the output of your
16:35 - compilation of your C program right
16:39 - so when you want to run your C program
16:43 - you just need to give this command so
16:46 - whatever is the name of your exe file
16:49 - you can give the name of your exe file
16:51 - for example main dot exe file right so I
16:56 - want to run this main.exe file I can
16:59 - just
17:00 - type main.exe and in Powershell it's
17:03 - going to auto complete so I can just
17:05 - type main dot exe here and then when I
17:09 - press tab it's going to just give dot
17:13 - backslash automatically to your file and
17:16 - then when you press enter it's going to
17:18 - ask me for the first number because my
17:20 - program is asking me to enter the first
17:23 - number and the second number so I am
17:25 - going to enter
17:26 - 2 as the first number 5 as the second
17:29 - number and it's going to show me the sum
17:31 - of these two numbers this is what this
17:34 - program is doing right in command prompt
17:37 - you can just write main dot EXE
17:40 - and then press enter and once again I am
17:44 - going to give the first number and then
17:46 - the second number and it's going to give
17:48 - the sum of these two numbers
17:51 - so
17:53 - main dot C is the file where you write
17:56 - your program and Main dot exe or
18:00 - main2.exe is the output of your program
18:03 - which you can run on the terminal using
18:07 - visual studio code
18:08 - now let's say I want to debug my program
18:11 - how can I do this
18:13 - so I can put a debugger option here so
18:18 - this is called the break point so I can
18:20 - go to any line and I can put the
18:23 - breakpoint on each and every line and
18:27 - when I go to debug option so when I
18:30 - click on debug option I will be able to
18:33 - see all my break points here right so I
18:36 - can see my breakpoint on line 6 and line
18:41 - 9 I can even put the breakpoint on line
18:43 - 12 and it will be added here you can
18:46 - toggle all the breakpoint which means
18:49 - they will be disabled and once you once
18:53 - again toggle they will be enabled
18:55 - you can just remove all the breakpoint
18:58 - using these options so this is how you
19:00 - can add or toggle or remove your
19:04 - breakpoints in order to run your program
19:07 - in debug mode you can click on run and
19:10 - debug and once you click on run and
19:13 - debug you can select your debugger in
19:15 - our case we have installed Min GW which
19:19 - comes with GDB debugger so you can click
19:22 - on C plus plus GDB
19:25 - and once you click on C plus plus GDB
19:28 - you will be able to see this gcc.exe
19:31 - option so I'm going to click on this
19:33 - gcc.exe option
19:35 - and once I click on GCC dot exe option
19:40 - my program is going to run and you can
19:44 - see the debugger has been started and
19:48 - you can see uh when the debugger starts
19:51 - you will be able to see all these
19:53 - options here
19:55 - so you can see at the top
19:59 - this run or continue option step over
20:04 - option then step into option and then
20:07 - step out option so you can see
20:11 - I have created my first breakpoint on
20:14 - line six so the program execution
20:16 - stopped on this line I can now see all
20:22 - the variables or local variables here so
20:26 - you can see in num1 there is a value of
20:30 - 16 which is the garbage value because we
20:32 - haven't assigned any value ah to S if we
20:36 - have assigned for example num is equal
20:38 - to 0 then it will show the zero value if
20:41 - you don't initialize your variables it
20:44 - is going to take some garbage value
20:46 - initially then I can click on step over
20:49 - which is going to go to this ah
20:53 - code where I will be asked to provide a
20:57 - number I can provide a number here for
21:00 - example and then my program execution
21:03 - stopped to the second break point which
21:05 - is this one I can step over I can
21:08 - provide a second number and then press
21:11 - on continue and then my program
21:13 - execution stops at sum is equal to num 1
21:18 - plus num2 so I can just step over once
21:21 - again to the next line and you can see
21:23 - some
21:24 - value is 17 which is the sum of 8 and 9
21:28 - and it's going to print this text when I
21:32 - once I click on continue here you can
21:35 - see the output is printed here
21:38 - so this is how you can use the debugger
21:41 - for the C program on Visual Studio code
21:45 - so this is how you can set up the C
21:47 - programming setup on your Visual Studio
21:50 - code I hope you enjoyed this video and I
21:53 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up C support on your Visual Studio code editor on your windows 11 operating system so for this you will need two things first one is obvious which is Visual Studio code so if you haven't installed Visual Studio code I will recommend you to install it it's a very easy and simple process and if you don't know how to install Visual Studio code I will put the link of the video in which I have shown how you can install and use Visual Studio code and once you have Visual Studio code we need a second tool which is called a compiler right so a compiler will help you to compile your CNC plus code on any operating system so for Windows we are going to install the Min GW compiler so let's start with that so first of all open your favorite browser and search for bin GW and in the search result you will see some websites so don't click on the first website which you will see here which is from Source Forge you need to open this website which says Min GW hyphen w64.org so just click on this link which says Min GW hyphen w64.org and once this website opens you will be able to see the overview here and on this website you can click on the downloads link here so here you will be able to see all the download link for bin GW for different operating systems so the one we are looking for is the windows version so we are going to click on this link which says Min GW w64 builds so just click on this link which is going to open this kind of window again and from here you can download the Min GW builds from Source Force so you need to click on this link now right so Source forged link was shown directly in the search result but you need to go through this website in order to come to this website and once you are redirected to the sourceforge.net website you will see that Min GW 64bit installer exe file will be downloaded on your windows 11 operating system so once this file is downloaded I'm going to click on this file and then you will see this warning which says do you want to allow this app from unknown publisher to make changes on your device I trust this so I will click on yes here and I'm going to minimize this browser and you can see Min GW installer has been started on my windows 11 operating system so on the first window I just need to click on next here which is going to start the installation here you can choose the version for Min GW so I'm going to choose the top most option which is 8.1.0 at the time of making this video you can also choose the architecture I'm going to choose x8664 and then you can choose the threads so generally for Threads I always choose posix but you can also choose win32 also also exception you have two options I will leave it as default and then you have the build revision I will leave it as default also and then click on next and this will be the location where your Min GW compiler will be installed so you can see it will be installed in the program files Min GW directory will be created and then this folder will be created right so if you don't have the good reason to change this location just leave it as default and also you can leave this checkbox as checked which is going to create a shortcut for your Min GW compiler tool so I'm going to click on next now which is going to start the download of all the files and packages for your mingw tools so just wait for this process to reach to the 100 Mark so now after some time I can see this window which says click next to continue the installation so I'm going to click on the next and now I can see this message which says Min GW has been successfully installed and I can click on finish to complete the installation so let me click on the Finish button so once I click on the Finish button Min GW is installed on my Windows operating systems so now once mingw is installed first of all we need to know the location where Min GW is installed so at the time of installation you might have noted the location so let me show you the default location where Min GW will be installed so you need to go inside the C directory and then go inside program files and then you will be able to see this Min GW hyphen W 64 bit folder here and then this folder will be there so this is the location where Min GW is installed then you need to go inside Min gw64 and here under the bin folder you will see all the files which will help you to compile your C or C plus plus programs okay so go until the bin folder right and you need to copy this path now we need to set the environment variable for Min GW so that we can use GCC or G plus plus command on our Windows command prompt or Powershell or terminal so for that what you need to do you just need to click on search and then search for edit EnV and it's going to show you this result which says edit environment variables for your account and you can see this window is going to open right now if you can't find this edit environment variable window using the search option then you can always open the control panel and then once control panel opens you need to view by category here and then click on system and security and then once again click on system here which is going to open the settings app and here it's going to show you an about section this link which says Advanced system settings so just click on that and then click on environment variables which is also going to open the same window so you can choose any one of the method so once this environment variables window opens select path under system variables and then click on edit and then click on new here okay so it's going to allow you to add a new environment variable and then just copy the path until the bin folder inside your Min gw64 bit folder okay so this path is until bin folder okay and once you copied it you can just add this path here inside your environment variables and then just press enter which is going to add your path and then click OK here and then click OK and then once again click on OK and now you can close all the windows here and now we can test our GCC and G plus plus versions and commands right so you can open the command prompt by just pressing CMD and then open the command prompt from the result and once the command prompt is open here you can just write GCC space hyphen hyphen version and then press enter and if you see some result which looks like this that means GCC command is working successfully on your windows 11 operating system similarly you can also check the G plus plus command which is also used to compile your C plus plus programs so it's also going to show you this kind of result here so once you see this kind of result that means your GCC and G plus plus commands are working so once you have bin GW compiler and visual studio code on your Windows operating system let's create a c program and let's see how we can set up a c program with Visual Studio code so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a folder on my desktop you can create a folder at any location on your Windows operating system so that let me right click here and then let me just select new and then create a new folder I'm going to name my folder as C apps and then press enter and then I'm going to go inside this c apps folder then I can right click on this folder and then I can click on show more option and I can see this open with code option so I can just click on open with code which is going to open Visual Studio code in this folder okay so you can see see apps is open right here you can just click on I trust the author and you can see the c apps folder has been opened on Visual Studio code right you can do that or if you are a fan of command line you can open the command line so right click here and then click on open in terminal and once the terminal opens you can even open the visual studio code in this c apps folder by just writing code space dot this means I want to open the visual studio code in the current directory so I am going to press enter which is also going to open Visual Studio code in the current directory in which I am present so right now I am present in the c apps folder and that is what it's going to open in Visual Studio code now inside the c apps let me create a very simple C file so I'm going to click on this new file button I can even click on file and then click on new file and from here I can create a new file right so let me just create a file by clicking on this new file button and then I'm going to name my file as main dot C and then press enter now as soon as I just create a main.c file you are going to see some kind of notification pair Visual Studio code is going to detect that you want to create a CR program and it is going to suggest you to install the related C or C plus plus extensions if it doesn't show any suggestions you can always go to the extension tab so just click on this extensions Tab and then search for C and C plus plus ok so C forward slash C plus plus and once you search for C and C plus plus the top ah extension here is from Microsoft you can see you can just select here this extension and then in your case you are going to see the install option I have already installed this extension in your case you are going to see the install button here so you just need to click on install so this C and C plus plus extension from Microsoft which is the developer for visual studio code is going to run your C or C plus plus program is going to help you to ah debug or browse your COC plus program and it is going to also give the intellisense capability in your C or C plus plus program so just install this and once you have installed this all the features of this extension will be available on your Visual Studio code editor you can also see you have other extensions like C or C plus plus themes here so it's going to look like this so whatever extensions you can see are related to C or C plus plus I will suggest you to install all of them they are going to help you to better run your C or C plus plus programs on Windows operating system in Visual Studio code right now you can see reload is required for this extra extension so I can just click on read load and it's going to uh reload my visual studio code so now let me just go to this Explorer section here where I have created the main.c file I can write a very simple C program here which is going to ask for two numbers and it is going to just add these two numbers and show us the result right this is a very simple program you can find anywhere on the internet now in order to run this program what you can do you can either click on this terminal and open a new terminal and using GCC you can run your C program which is by just using the normal terminal command right you can also create a build task here so you can see there is this ah option called run build task so I'm going to click on this run build task and it's going to give me the suggestion which build task I want to create here it says GCC dot exe because I have created the C file and visual studio code is going to recognize that this is a C file and that's why it's giving us this gcc.exe option so I am going to just click on this which is going to start building my program you can see starting build and you can see the build is successful so my C program has been compiled successfully and you can see main.exe file has been created once the build is complete you can even run this GCC command in your terminal by opening a new terminal so you can click on this plus sign and it's going to open the default command prompt in my case it's Powershell you can even open the command prompt from here so you can see this is the command prompt so you can either use Powershell or command prompt to compile your program also right I have used this inbuilt capability of Visual Studio code to build my program let me show you how you can build the program using the command line also so here I can write GCC dot exe and then I can give the name of my main dot C file so let me give the name of my file and then hyphen o and then the name of my output file which will be the executable file so I can name it as Main 2 dot exe file for example right main exe file is already created by this GCC build option so I can create a second exe file and I can run this and you can see this main2.gcc file is created now in order to run these exe files these exe files are the output of your compilation of your C program right so when you want to run your C program you just need to give this command so whatever is the name of your exe file you can give the name of your exe file for example main dot exe file right so I want to run this main.exe file I can just type main.exe and in Powershell it's going to auto complete so I can just type main dot exe here and then when I press tab it's going to just give dot backslash automatically to your file and then when you press enter it's going to ask me for the first number because my program is asking me to enter the first number and the second number so I am going to enter 2 as the first number 5 as the second number and it's going to show me the sum of these two numbers this is what this program is doing right in command prompt you can just write main dot EXE and then press enter and once again I am going to give the first number and then the second number and it's going to give the sum of these two numbers so main dot C is the file where you write your program and Main dot exe or main2.exe is the output of your program which you can run on the terminal using visual studio code now let's say I want to debug my program how can I do this so I can put a debugger option here so this is called the break point so I can go to any line and I can put the breakpoint on each and every line and when I go to debug option so when I click on debug option I will be able to see all my break points here right so I can see my breakpoint on line 6 and line 9 I can even put the breakpoint on line 12 and it will be added here you can toggle all the breakpoint which means they will be disabled and once you once again toggle they will be enabled you can just remove all the breakpoint using these options so this is how you can add or toggle or remove your breakpoints in order to run your program in debug mode you can click on run and debug and once you click on run and debug you can select your debugger in our case we have installed Min GW which comes with GDB debugger so you can click on C plus plus GDB and once you click on C plus plus GDB you will be able to see this gcc.exe option so I'm going to click on this gcc.exe option and once I click on GCC dot exe option my program is going to run and you can see the debugger has been started and you can see uh when the debugger starts you will be able to see all these options here so you can see at the top this run or continue option step over option then step into option and then step out option so you can see I have created my first breakpoint on line six so the program execution stopped on this line I can now see all the variables or local variables here so you can see in num1 there is a value of 16 which is the garbage value because we haven't assigned any value ah to S if we have assigned for example num is equal to 0 then it will show the zero value if you don't initialize your variables it is going to take some garbage value initially then I can click on step over which is going to go to this ah code where I will be asked to provide a number I can provide a number here for example and then my program execution stopped to the second break point which is this one I can step over I can provide a second number and then press on continue and then my program execution stops at sum is equal to num 1 plus num2 so I can just step over once again to the next line and you can see some value is 17 which is the sum of 8 and 9 and it's going to print this text when I once I click on continue here you can see the output is printed here so this is how you can use the debugger for the C program on Visual Studio code so this is how you can set up the C programming setup on your Visual Studio code I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
