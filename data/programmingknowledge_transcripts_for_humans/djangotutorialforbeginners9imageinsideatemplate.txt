00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so this
00:02 - is our ninth tutorial of a jungle series
00:04 - so I again will come you all to
00:05 - programming knowledge so this is the
00:08 - night to ninth tutorial and we're going
00:10 - to work with images so this is going to
00:12 - be very interesting tutorial and we're
00:13 - going to be very a quick one so so I
00:17 - will tell you that in this tutorial I'm
00:19 - already define the path with my image
00:21 - page three and already defined a
00:24 - function in which dot py file and only
00:27 - define an HTML page so I will die
00:30 - directly operate on this so you can
00:32 - check out the code on the github
00:33 - repository as well so what we are going
00:36 - to do here you can see here you can see
00:37 - my this is my views dot py file and I
00:40 - have already find my image page 2 page 3
00:43 - page 4 so what we are going to do we are
00:46 - going to start our local server which is
00:48 - already started and inside my local
00:51 - server I would move to this route my
00:53 - image page 3 so I show you some
00:56 - interesting fact about this so this is
00:59 - our image page and here you can see that
01:02 - I have defined a row ok I have defined a
01:06 - row and above that I have to find a
01:08 - container fluid with the heading image
01:10 - page 3 and inside the row there are 4
01:14 - columns of width medium 3 each so here
01:19 - you can see 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 is
01:24 - equal to 12 and this satisfies our basic
01:28 - requirement of the bootstrap column
01:30 - query so here it shows 12 columns so
01:34 - here you can see 3 3 3 3 is equal to 12
01:39 - and as soon as I press control-shift
01:42 - I you can see you can see okay
01:47 - and they take your head you can see that
01:50 - this is a source code ok and let me
01:52 - click right click and click inspect yeah
01:54 - here it is row column width of 3 3 3 3
02:01 - and this one medium device as when I
02:03 - click on galaxy s5 it would all
02:05 - collapsed and will move up to a scroll
02:09 - view and this would bring this console
02:11 - nature ok
02:12 - you move to the image page for dot HTML
02:17 - this is we're going to very interesting
02:18 - here you can see the key difference you
02:21 - need to absorb a key difference here
02:23 - that here I had to find medium three MD
02:26 - I defined a class inside the bootstrap
02:29 - which was defined in the grid system as
02:31 - well I'll show you in the grid system
02:34 - here here it is this was small sm m d LG
02:38 - excel when i have not defined any class
02:42 - whether it is medium MD SM small XL
02:46 - extra large I have all I'll move to this
02:50 - here you can see I have defined medium
02:52 - in this my image page Street or HTML but
02:54 - now when I moved to my image page for
02:57 - dot HTML I have not defined any class so
02:59 - here you can see the gap so they are
03:02 - there I have not defined any class here
03:04 - so you can have a view for it so this is
03:08 - called MD three and this is only called
03:12 - for you can make it as three as well
03:15 - this is called four or okay so when
03:19 - they're four plus four plus four is
03:22 - equal to 12
03:23 - and now when I move to my image page
03:26 - four okay this is my image page four
03:33 - here you can see this is or I'll click
03:37 - on inspect okay
03:39 - okay I'll show you one thing this is row
03:42 - four four four
03:45 - okay but I told you that I have not
03:49 - defined any class head whether it is a
03:51 - medium small extra-large now when I move
03:54 - to galaxy s5 here you can see the magic
03:58 - now you hear it also stays as for four
04:02 - and four
04:04 - so this wizard up to twelve and this was
04:07 - the major difference I wanted to show
04:10 - you in the my image page four dot HTML
04:13 - that here I'm not defined like this is
04:16 - page three I am not defined any class
04:19 - here sorry in this I have defined a
04:21 - class in my image page three dot HTM and
04:24 - I have defined a class but image paid
04:26 - for
04:26 - HTM I have not defined any class and
04:29 - when I moved to my image page for dot
04:33 - HTML this is 4 plus 4 plus 4 but as soon
04:36 - I move to a smaller device it still
04:39 - remains it still remains 4 4 4 it does
04:43 - not collapsed so this is that for every
04:46 - device you want in this structure then
04:48 - you don't define a class then bootstrap
04:51 - will automatically maintain this
04:53 - structure ok now we are going to do one
04:56 - thing one small exercise this is going
05:00 - to be real quick ok I'll define my image
05:03 - page 5 ok I'll be quick with this image
05:10 - page 5 ok now I'll move to my templates
05:17 - ok I'll move to my templates this my
05:21 - template I'll quickly copy this paste it
05:26 - in here image page five dot HTML this is
05:36 - image page five dot HTML I'll quickly
05:39 - wrap up this content inside the row I'm
05:44 - older and I'm only left with the row
05:48 - inside my views dot py file
05:54 - ok now inside my boost or py file I'll
05:57 - define my image page five copy this here
06:09 - you can see and this is going to be 5
06:11 - and this is 4 ok and this is going to be
06:19 - 5 and I change the heading here so this
06:23 - here you can see this is the benefit of
06:24 - using great template engine you can
06:26 - quickly define your templates
06:28 - ok now I'll move to five now this looks
06:32 - fine this is this is an empty page okay
06:35 - but now inside my us dot PDF file I will
06:40 - King a string parameter with the image
06:45 - name okay
06:48 - I'll be taking a string parameter with
06:50 - the image name image name and inside my
06:55 - views dot py file you know if you have
06:59 - any doubt regarding how you take
07:00 - parameter inside a URL you can refer to
07:03 - my previous tutorial so image name is
07:07 - going to bend my new parameter okay and
07:11 - what I'm going to do I will define a
07:14 - variable image name we'll take this
07:16 - parameter image name okay let me define
07:19 - this as my image my image name okay and
07:27 - if okay and I'll go for another
07:31 - operation my image name this is a simple
07:36 - Python Python function I'm using my
07:40 - image name dot first what I will do is
07:46 - this is going I'm going to typecast this
07:48 - as a string parameter use my image state
07:52 - name dot lower and I'll first print this
07:58 - my image name okay this is pretty fine
08:02 - okay this looks be defined okay now I'll
08:05 - move to my image page five and I'll type
08:08 - Chango okay so here you can see I have
08:15 - print printed Django on my local machine
08:18 - now what I'm going to do I'm going to
08:21 - define a dictionary for the before this
08:24 - or maybe what we can do okay I'll take
08:30 - variable where and I'll give it a
08:35 - default value or we can do one thing if
08:39 - my image name is equal to Django then
08:46 - where is equal to true
08:52 - LF my image name is equal to fight on
09:03 - where is equal to false okay
09:10 - however you can do what that or maybe
09:14 - let me you can do one thing
09:16 - where is equal to false and now what I'm
09:22 - going to do I'm going to create a my
09:24 - dictionary my dictionary and I'll
09:29 - password as well okay now context is
09:37 - equal to my dictionary okay this looks
09:40 - pretty fine till here and I'll save this
09:42 - so my server is running okay now when I
09:49 - move to my image page five dot HTML so
09:54 - what I'm going to do is I'll quickly
09:57 - copy the image syntax here what I'm
10:00 - going to try to do I'll show you that
10:02 - this is how you can copy this okay okay
10:14 - this is fine this is fine
10:16 - and I'll define as twelve okay
10:21 - for your convenience you can use it as
10:23 - tall MD 12 and in another one but before
10:30 - this I type percent F rare I'll use this
10:39 - block else else I'll use this block and
10:51 - I'll end this with NF person and Cave
11:00 - okay this looks pretty fine
11:03 - and I'll copy this and quickly paste it
11:09 - here okay
11:10 - first I need to check my back-end part
11:12 - what was it
11:14 - I worked my usual pi 2py file if that is
11:18 - equal to two then I need to be true then
11:22 - I'd need to get the Django image if
11:24 - value is a good false I need to get a
11:26 - Python image okay so this is fine and
11:29 - this would be Python dot here python dot
11:31 - PNG okay so this looks pretty fine and
11:35 - looks interesting as well okay
11:39 - now I would type Chango so here you can
11:43 - see I got the Django image and Python
11:50 - yeah I could have python image so this
11:52 - was pretty fine and hey what I'm going
11:56 - to show you that this is the magic I
11:58 - want to tell you that I can render two
12:02 - images on a single route maybe I'll type
12:04 - Django with the capital letters okay
12:09 - here it is come because I had used the
12:10 - functions lower I'll move to my fused
12:13 - retriever file
12:14 - okay I'll lose other things and open my
12:19 - muse dot py file okay I had used the
12:24 - lower function okay if my image name is
12:26 - equal to Django where is equal to true
12:28 - as it's false okay so maybe I when I
12:32 - type Python with capital letters
12:36 - I'll get this so this looks pretty
12:39 - awesome you can maybe I can do also tag
12:43 - this as capital D small Django and
12:46 - capital G and small o Django
12:48 - this also works so this is great so here
12:51 - I told you that with it's simple back
12:53 - and logic you can render multiple images
12:55 - on your front-end application so that I
12:57 - will catch a catch up you in the next
12:59 - structure so thank you guys and once
13:01 - again welcome to programming knowledge

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to programming knowledge so this is our ninth tutorial of a jungle series so I again will come you all to programming knowledge so this is the night to ninth tutorial and we're going to work with images so this is going to be very interesting tutorial and we're going to be very a quick one so so I will tell you that in this tutorial I'm already define the path with my image page three and already defined a function in which dot py file and only define an HTML page so I will die directly operate on this so you can check out the code on the github repository as well so what we are going to do here you can see here you can see my this is my views dot py file and I have already find my image page 2 page 3 page 4 so what we are going to do we are going to start our local server which is already started and inside my local server I would move to this route my image page 3 so I show you some interesting fact about this so this is our image page and here you can see that I have defined a row ok I have defined a row and above that I have to find a container fluid with the heading image page 3 and inside the row there are 4 columns of width medium 3 each so here you can see 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 is equal to 12 and this satisfies our basic requirement of the bootstrap column query so here it shows 12 columns so here you can see 3 3 3 3 is equal to 12 and as soon as I press controlshift I you can see you can see okay and they take your head you can see that this is a source code ok and let me click right click and click inspect yeah here it is row column width of 3 3 3 3 and this one medium device as when I click on galaxy s5 it would all collapsed and will move up to a scroll view and this would bring this console nature ok you move to the image page for dot HTML this is we're going to very interesting here you can see the key difference you need to absorb a key difference here that here I had to find medium three MD I defined a class inside the bootstrap which was defined in the grid system as well I'll show you in the grid system here here it is this was small sm m d LG excel when i have not defined any class whether it is medium MD SM small XL extra large I have all I'll move to this here you can see I have defined medium in this my image page Street or HTML but now when I moved to my image page for dot HTML I have not defined any class so here you can see the gap so they are there I have not defined any class here so you can have a view for it so this is called MD three and this is only called for you can make it as three as well this is called four or okay so when they're four plus four plus four is equal to 12 and now when I move to my image page four okay this is my image page four here you can see this is or I'll click on inspect okay okay I'll show you one thing this is row four four four okay but I told you that I have not defined any class head whether it is a medium small extralarge now when I move to galaxy s5 here you can see the magic now you hear it also stays as for four and four so this wizard up to twelve and this was the major difference I wanted to show you in the my image page four dot HTML that here I'm not defined like this is page three I am not defined any class here sorry in this I have defined a class in my image page three dot HTM and I have defined a class but image paid for HTM I have not defined any class and when I moved to my image page for dot HTML this is 4 plus 4 plus 4 but as soon I move to a smaller device it still remains it still remains 4 4 4 it does not collapsed so this is that for every device you want in this structure then you don't define a class then bootstrap will automatically maintain this structure ok now we are going to do one thing one small exercise this is going to be real quick ok I'll define my image page 5 ok I'll be quick with this image page 5 ok now I'll move to my templates ok I'll move to my templates this my template I'll quickly copy this paste it in here image page five dot HTML this is image page five dot HTML I'll quickly wrap up this content inside the row I'm older and I'm only left with the row inside my views dot py file ok now inside my boost or py file I'll define my image page five copy this here you can see and this is going to be 5 and this is 4 ok and this is going to be 5 and I change the heading here so this here you can see this is the benefit of using great template engine you can quickly define your templates ok now I'll move to five now this looks fine this is this is an empty page okay but now inside my us

regarding how you take parameter inside a URL you can refer to my previous tutorial so image name is going to bend my new parameter okay and what I'm going to do I will define a variable image name we'll take this parameter image name okay let me define this as my image my image name okay and if okay and I'll go for another operation my image name this is a simple Python Python function I'm
