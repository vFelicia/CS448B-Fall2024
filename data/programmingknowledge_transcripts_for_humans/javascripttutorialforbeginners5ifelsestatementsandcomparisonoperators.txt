00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will learn about if else
00:07 - statement in JavaScript and how to use
00:11 - some of the comparison operators in
00:14 - JavaScript so let's get started so first
00:17 - of all why do we need to use Al
00:21 - statements so sometimes in your code you
00:25 - need to use some conditions on the basis
00:29 - of which you want to execute some code
00:32 - and IFL statement will help you to do
00:36 - exactly that so for example I want to
00:39 - check the age of the person if it's
00:42 - greater than 18 equal to 18 or less than
00:45 - 18 okay so I have a variable called age
00:51 - whose value initially I assign is equal
00:54 - to 18 okay and to check whether it's 18
00:59 - or it's below 18 or it's greater than 18
01:03 - you want to check it and then execute
01:06 - some code okay so you can use if
01:09 - statement for that and the basic Syntax
01:12 - for if statement is if keyword and then
01:16 - these brackets and then these curly
01:20 - braces and in here in these round
01:24 - bracket your condition will be
01:28 - evaluated and if this condition in these
01:31 - bracket are met then this code is
01:35 - executed inside these curly braces okay
01:39 - so let's check the condition okay so I
01:43 - have this variable called age and I want
01:46 - to check whether it's equal to 18 or not
01:49 - so I just give these two equal to sign
01:53 - and I evaluate against 18 now the these
01:57 - double equal to means equality okay so
02:02 - this is for checking the equality this
02:06 - single equal to is the assignment
02:10 - operator right and this double equal to
02:14 - is the equality checking operator okay
02:17 - so if this condition is met then we want
02:21 - to execute some code for example we want
02:24 - to print something using
02:26 - document. write and we will say the age
02:31 - is equal to 18 okay and save your code
02:35 - and refresh your web page
02:37 - here and it says the age is equal to 18
02:42 - okay now let's say in the case when this
02:46 - age is not equal to 18 we want to
02:49 - execute some other code so in that case
02:53 - we use else condition so just write else
02:58 - and then these curly braces okay so when
03:02 - this condition in if statement is not
03:05 - true your program logic comes to else
03:10 - condition and it executes the code which
03:13 - is inside these curly braces after else
03:17 - okay so I will just copy this here and I
03:21 - say age is not equal to 18 and let's say
03:28 - right now the age is 20 we assign age is
03:31 - equal to 20 and save it and refresh your
03:35 - web page and now it says age is not
03:38 - equal to 18 okay now not only you can
03:41 - use equality here you can also compare
03:45 - non equality for example I want to
03:47 - compare non-equality I give this
03:50 - exclamation mark and then this equal to
03:53 - sign and I can save it and I can refresh
03:56 - my web page and it says the age is equal
03:59 - to 18 okay which is here okay so I'm
04:05 - checking whether my age is not equal to
04:09 - 18 and right now the age is equal to 20
04:13 - right so it goes here because the
04:16 - condition is true because 20 is not
04:20 - equal to 18 so it prints this statement
04:24 - okay now there are few operators which
04:29 - are called called comparison operator
04:31 - which you can use in place of these
04:34 - equal and non-equal signs okay so let's
04:38 - see what are they so these are some of
04:42 - the comparison operator we can use in
04:45 - JavaScript so we have already seen how
04:47 - to check equality now let's see what
04:52 - does these triple equal to do okay so
04:57 - for example I have AG is equal to 18
05:00 - here and I want to check if our age is
05:05 - equal to 18 obviously this will print
05:08 - this statement because this condition is
05:10 - true now we all know that right now age
05:14 - is a integer variable because we have
05:16 - assigned a number to it now let's see
05:20 - and check whether it gives this
05:24 - statement if we compare this age against
05:28 - a string value right so just save it and
05:33 - refresh our web page and it says the age
05:36 - is equal to 18 right so right now this
05:40 - double equal to only checks the value
05:44 - and not the type of your value but when
05:48 - you use triple equal to it will check
05:51 - the value as well as the type of your
05:56 - variable okay so now let's see what
05:59 - happens so save it and refresh your page
06:02 - and now it says the age is not equal to
06:05 - 18 because these triple equal to is
06:08 - checking whether the value is 18 which
06:10 - is yes it's 18 but the type is string
06:15 - right and we are checking it against a
06:17 - number so then it will go here because
06:21 - this condition is not met okay so this
06:25 - is how you can use triple equal to
06:28 - non-quality we have already seen this
06:30 - exclamation mark with double equal means
06:33 - we are checking non-equality in value
06:36 - and non-equality in type also okay now
06:40 - the next symbol is for checking if the
06:43 - value is greater than the values so for
06:46 - example we can use these angle brackets
06:51 - and here we use the number for example
06:54 - 18 once again and let's change this uh
06:58 - print message here so we we can say age
07:00 - is greater than 18 and here we can say
07:04 - age is less than 18 okay and save your
07:08 - code and refresh your web page and it
07:11 - says age is less than 18 right which is
07:16 - this statement because in our case age
07:19 - is equal to 18 and not greater than 18
07:22 - right now the next symbol is to check
07:26 - whether age is greater than or equal to
07:30 - okay so you can use this and after this
07:33 - you can use equal to sign and then it
07:36 - will check if age is greater than or age
07:41 - is equal to 18 right so save your code
07:46 - and refresh your web page and now it
07:48 - says the age is greater than 18 we must
07:52 - add this equal to symbol also here like
07:56 - this so this message is more clear
08:00 - right now in the same way we have the
08:03 - less than symbol so whenever you use
08:07 - here the less than symbol then it checks
08:10 - whether age is less than or equal to 18
08:14 - okay so let's save it and refresh your
08:16 - code and now it says the age is greater
08:19 - than or equal to 18 which is this
08:23 - statement okay now let's say you want to
08:26 - check multiple conditions so how you can
08:30 - do this so in JavaScript you can also
08:34 - use nested Al statement so for example
08:39 - here I'm checking if the value is 18 and
08:41 - if the value is 18 I will say value is
08:44 - equal to 18 and then I also want to
08:48 - check if the value is greater than 18 or
08:50 - not so after this curly braces where
08:53 - this curly brace end and before the else
08:57 - condition I can introduce one more if
09:00 - condition like this and then you can do
09:05 - something like this and here you can add
09:09 - the keyword called else okay so it
09:13 - checks this condition else if this
09:16 - condition is true then it this statement
09:18 - will be executed else otherwise this
09:22 - statement can be executed so let's say
09:25 - we want to check if age is greater than
09:29 - 18 or not okay so copy it here and let's
09:33 - replace with greater than okay and let's
09:37 - say age is equal to 20 this time okay so
09:41 - refresh your web page and now it says
09:43 - the age is greater than 18 so what is
09:47 - our program flow our program goes to if
09:50 - condition and it checks whether 20 is
09:53 - equal to 18 or not which is not so it
09:56 - goes to next step and it checks this
09:59 - condition and check whether 20 is
10:01 - greater than 18 or not which is true so
10:04 - it execute this statement and it don't
10:07 - need to go to the third statement
10:10 - because this is already true right so in
10:13 - this way you can also use if else
10:16 - statement in nested format okay so in
10:21 - this way you can use if El statement in
10:23 - JavaScript and you can use these
10:26 - comparison operators in JavaScript I

hello guys welcome to the next video on JavaScript tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn about if else statement in JavaScript and how to use some of the comparison operators in JavaScript so let's get started so first of all why do we need to use Al statements so sometimes in your code you need to use some conditions on the basis of which you want to execute some code and IFL statement will help you to do exactly that so for example I want to check the age of the person if it's greater than 18 equal to 18 or less than 18 okay so I have a variable called age whose value initially I assign is equal to 18 okay and to check whether it's 18 or it's below 18 or it's greater than 18 you want to check it and then execute some code okay so you can use if statement for that and the basic Syntax for if statement is if keyword and then these brackets and then these curly braces and in here in these round bracket your condition will be evaluated and if this condition in these bracket are met then this code is executed inside these curly braces okay so let's check the condition okay so I have this variable called age and I want to check whether it's equal to 18 or not so I just give these two equal to sign and I evaluate against 18 now the these double equal to means equality okay so this is for checking the equality this single equal to is the assignment operator right and this double equal to is the equality checking operator okay so if this condition is met then we want to execute some code for example we want to print something using document. write and we will say the age is equal to 18 okay and save your code and refresh your web page here and it says the age is equal to 18 okay now let's say in the case when this age is not equal to 18 we want to execute some other code so in that case we use else condition so just write else and then these curly braces okay so when this condition in if statement is not true your program logic comes to else condition and it executes the code which is inside these curly braces after else okay so I will just copy this here and I say age is not equal to 18 and let's say right now the age is 20 we assign age is equal to 20 and save it and refresh your web page and now it says age is not equal to 18 okay now not only you can use equality here you can also compare non equality for example I want to compare nonequality I give this exclamation mark and then this equal to sign and I can save it and I can refresh my web page and it says the age is equal to 18 okay which is here okay so I'm checking whether my age is not equal to 18 and right now the age is equal to 20 right so it goes here because the condition is true because 20 is not equal to 18 so it prints this statement okay now there are few operators which are called called comparison operator which you can use in place of these equal and nonequal signs okay so let's see what are they so these are some of the comparison operator we can use in JavaScript so we have already seen how to check equality now let's see what does these triple equal to do okay so for example I have AG is equal to 18 here and I want to check if our age is equal to 18 obviously this will print this statement because this condition is true now we all know that right now age is a integer variable because we have assigned a number to it now let's see and check whether it gives this statement if we compare this age against a string value right so just save it and refresh our web page and it says the age is equal to 18 right so right now this double equal to only checks the value and not the type of your value but when you use triple equal to it will check the value as well as the type of your variable okay so now let's see what happens so save it and refresh your page and now it says the age is not equal to 18 because these triple equal to is checking whether the value is 18 which is yes it's 18 but the type is string right and we are checking it against a number so then it will go here because this condition is not met okay so this is how you can use triple equal to nonquality we have already seen this exclamation mark with double equal means we are checking nonequality in value and nonequality in type also okay now the next symbol is for checking if the value is greater than the values so for example we can use these angle brackets and here we use the number for example 18 once again and let's change this uh print message here so we we can say age is greater than 18 and here we can say age is less than 18 okay and save your code and refresh your web page and it says age is less than 18 right which is this statement because in our case age is equal to 18 and not greater than 18 right now the next symbol is to check whether age is greater than or equal to okay so you can use this and after this you can use equal to sign and then it will check if age is greater than or age is equal to 18 right so save your code and refresh your web page and now it says the age is greater than 18 we must add this equal to symbol also here like this so this message is more clear right now in the same way we have the less than symbol so whenever you use here the less than symbol then it checks whether age is less than or equal to 18 okay so let's save it and refresh your code and now it says the age is greater than or equal to 18 which is this statement okay now let's say you want to check multiple conditions so how you can do this so in JavaScript you can also use nested Al statement so for example here I'm checking if the value is 18 and if the value is 18 I will say value is equal to 18 and then I also want to check if the value is greater than 18 or not so after this curly braces where this curly brace end and before the else condition I can introduce one more if condition like this and then you can do something like this and here you can add the keyword called else okay so it checks this condition else if this condition is true then it this statement will be executed else otherwise this statement can be executed so let's say we want to check if age is greater than 18 or not okay so copy it here and let's replace with greater than okay and let's say age is equal to 20 this time okay so refresh your web page and now it says the age is greater than 18 so what is our program flow our program goes to if condition and it checks whether 20 is equal to 18 or not which is not so it goes to next step and it checks this condition and check whether 20 is greater than 18 or not which is true so it execute this statement and it don't need to go to the third statement because this is already true right so in this way you can also use if else statement in nested format okay so in this way you can use if El statement in JavaScript and you can use these comparison operators in JavaScript I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and
