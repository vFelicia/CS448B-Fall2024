00:00 - hello guys in the last video I have
00:02 - shown you how to use and how to define a
00:05 - function in Python in this video also
00:08 - I'm going to continue with functions and
00:10 - I'm going to show you how to use some
00:13 - other features in functions like default
00:15 - parameter and multiple parameters in
00:19 - function so let's get started in the
00:22 - last video I've shown you how you can
00:23 - declare a function so you can declare a
00:27 - function in Python like this f for
00:30 - example I want to make a function to
00:33 - print out the score of a student so I
00:36 - can
00:38 - say
00:40 - student uh score for example this is
00:43 - name of my function and in this uh
00:46 - brackets uh I can pass parameters right
00:49 - for example name and
00:52 - score okay and then this colon and
00:55 - inside this uh function we can write the
00:59 - definition definition or the code to our
01:03 - function for example I want to print
01:05 - something print the student name and
01:09 - score I can just
01:12 - write
01:17 - the or something like names code this
01:22 - much amount of uh marks so I can just
01:26 - write name and then comma and
01:32 - then
01:34 - scored and then
01:40 - comma this should be score right not
01:45 - scare comma marks
01:54 - right and this is simple you have
01:58 - already understood I think the concept
02:01 - of uh you know defining the function and
02:05 - how to print these values right and if I
02:08 - call this function it will just give me
02:13 - the answer for example I pass uh name as
02:17 - Mark and score as uh
02:22 - 70% and it's says marks code this much
02:25 - amount of marks right but sometimes you
02:29 - want that uh there are some default
02:33 - value which are already initializing
02:36 - these parameters for example in the case
02:39 - of
02:39 - databases it's a bad idea to save blank
02:44 - values or null values in the database so
02:48 - and you cannot depend upon the user that
02:51 - he can Define or you cannot you know be
02:55 - sure that user will Define uh parameter
03:00 - for every function so what you can do in
03:03 - Python is you can Define default
03:06 - parameter so once again I'm going to
03:09 - take this function but I will initialize
03:12 - this function with some value so that it
03:16 - will not be null at any point for
03:19 - example Tom as name and score is equal
03:24 - to Z for example right
03:28 - now I can just print the score and name
03:34 - and the default value will remain just
03:37 - the same right and my function is
03:40 - defined and now when I use this function
03:44 - and even if I don't pass any parameter
03:48 - generally you have to pass the parameter
03:50 - when you define a function and when you
03:53 - define a function with parameters but
03:55 - when you initialize a function with
03:57 - default value you even skip passing the
04:02 - values to your parameter and once I call
04:06 - this function it says Tom scored zero
04:09 - marks because Tom is a default value and
04:12 - score of Tom is zero okay so Tom is a
04:15 - default name and zero is the default
04:19 - Mark and so you can ask what is the
04:23 - purpose of this the purpose of this is
04:26 - if the user will not pass any value as
04:29 - an argument then default value will be
04:32 - taken otherwise if the user enters some
04:36 - valid name for
04:39 - example
04:41 - Mark and 85 marks and once again you can
04:48 - see it's printing marks code 85 marks
04:52 - okay so it has overwritten this stor as
04:56 - Mark the name it has overwritten
05:00 - uh as Mark and the score is overwritten
05:03 - by 85 right now you can choose to you
05:09 - know pass the first parameter and skip
05:12 - the second parameter for example you can
05:15 - just pass Mark here and it says marks
05:20 - Code Zero marks because this it has
05:24 - taken as the first parameter and it has
05:27 - over it in the name but we haven't
05:30 - passed our score so it will take the
05:32 - score as default which is zero so it
05:34 - will print like this now for for example
05:37 - you want to pass this score and you want
05:40 - the name to be default what you can do
05:43 - once again take the
05:45 - function and this time just write
05:49 - score is equal to 99 for example and it
05:53 - says Tom scored 99 marks right so Tom is
05:58 - the default value here
06:00 - and 99 is uh overwritten uh or zero is
06:05 - overwritten by 99 which you passed okay
06:09 - so this is about default uh parameter
06:13 - passing now there is a concept of
06:18 - passing multiple parameters to a
06:22 - function and how you can pass these
06:25 - multiple parameter for example uh you I
06:29 - will take the same example of
06:31 - student and you want to pass some
06:36 - parameters so I want to pass uh name of
06:40 - the student and I want to pass multiple
06:44 - score of the student for example
06:46 - students has um scored uh you know marks
06:50 - in language marks in programming marks
06:54 - in maths or marks in some other subject
06:58 - and you want want to pass the parameters
07:01 - but you don't know the number of subject
07:04 - uh you know student uh is uh you know
07:09 - taking so what you can do in this
07:12 - condition you can just
07:15 - use the name as it is but for example
07:21 - you want to pass multiple scores you can
07:24 - just use
07:26 - estx and this estx says python
07:31 - that this parameter will be
07:35 - passed one as one parameter also or
07:39 - multiple parameters also so one or more
07:42 - parameter so estx says uh to the python
07:47 - that this score can be multiple also or
07:50 - even it can be uh one also
07:54 - okay and it's saying
07:58 - invalid
08:00 - invalid uh syntax let's see what's the
08:04 - error yeah I have
08:06 - forgotten the def keyword to define a
08:11 - function so I will Define a function Def
08:14 - and then I will call This And once again
08:18 - I can
08:19 - print uh for example I will print first
08:23 - of all
08:25 - name
08:28 - print name and then I will
08:33 - print
08:37 - score okay and I will just call this
08:41 - function for example
08:44 - student and I will pass uh name as
08:49 - uh once again
08:52 - Mark and scores for example he has
08:55 - taken uh language course so he scored 55
09:00 - marks in this language course he has
09:03 - taken Math course he has scored 77 marks
09:07 - he has taken uh programming course he
09:10 - scored 90 marks he has taken other
09:14 - courses physics 67 marks or multiple
09:17 - courses okay so this is a wild card kind
09:22 - of Entry which says you can pass one or
09:25 - more parameters right and you see it has
09:29 - printed first of all the name of the
09:33 - student which is Mark and then
09:36 - these these marks as a tuple if you
09:40 - don't know what is a tuple tle is just
09:42 - like a list but you cannot edit a list
09:46 - or you cannot even delete an element
09:50 - from a list you can just read this
09:53 - element from Tuple right so tle is just
09:57 - like a list but the only difference is
10:00 - you cannot modify or delete any elements
10:03 - from this
10:04 - stle so this is uh tle right so in this
10:11 - way you can uh even uh pass multiple
10:14 - values using this estx and it's not
10:17 - necessary that you need to pass only two
10:20 - parameters you can just pass one
10:23 - parameter for example
10:25 - dep
10:26 - score something like this
10:30 - asri
10:31 - score it will be valid I forgot this
10:36 - called
10:38 - colon like
10:41 - this
10:43 - and what's the problem
10:49 - here so okay I left some indent here
10:54 - which it's saying unexpected indentation
10:58 - okay and you want to
11:02 - print
11:05 - score and it will be totally valid when
11:09 - you uh call this function score and you
11:13 - can pass multiple values one comma 3
11:17 - some some marks multiple
11:19 - marks
11:22 - right and it will give you a
11:26 - topple so in this way you can pass
11:29 - default parameters to a function and you
11:32 - can pass multiple parameters to a
11:34 - function in Python I hope you have

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in the last video I have shown you how to use and how to define a function in Python in this video also I'm going to continue with functions and I'm going to show you how to use some other features in functions like default parameter and multiple parameters in function so let's get started in the last video I've shown you how you can declare a function so you can declare a function in Python like this f for example I want to make a function to print out the score of a student so I can say student uh score for example this is name of my function and in this uh brackets uh I can pass parameters right for example name and score okay and then this colon and inside this uh function we can write the definition definition or the code to our function for example I want to print something print the student name and score I can just write the or something like names code this much amount of uh marks so I can just write name and then comma and then scored and then comma this should be score right not scare comma marks right and this is simple you have already understood I think the concept of uh you know defining the function and how to print these values right and if I call this function it will just give me the answer for example I pass uh name as Mark and score as uh 70% and it's says marks code this much amount of marks right but sometimes you want that uh there are some default value which are already initializing these parameters for example in the case of databases it's a bad idea to save blank values or null values in the database so and you cannot depend upon the user that he can Define or you cannot you know be sure that user will Define uh parameter for every function so what you can do in Python is you can Define default parameter so once again I'm going to take this function but I will initialize this function with some value so that it will not be null at any point for example Tom as name and score is equal to Z for example right now I can just print the score and name and the default value will remain just the same right and my function is defined and now when I use this function and even if I don't pass any parameter generally you have to pass the parameter when you define a function and when you define a function with parameters but when you initialize a function with default value you even skip passing the values to your parameter and once I call this function it says Tom scored zero marks because Tom is a default value and score of Tom is zero okay so Tom is a default name and zero is the default Mark and so you can ask what is the purpose of this the purpose of this is if the user will not pass any value as an argument then default value will be taken otherwise if the user enters some valid name for example Mark and 85 marks and once again you can see it's printing marks code 85 marks okay so it has overwritten this stor as Mark the name it has overwritten uh as Mark and the score is overwritten by 85 right now you can choose to you know pass the first parameter and skip the second parameter for example you can just pass Mark here and it says marks Code Zero marks because this it has taken as the first parameter and it has over it in the name but we haven't passed our score so it will take the score as default which is zero so it will print like this now for for example you want to pass this score and you want the name to be default what you can do once again take the function and this time just write score is equal to 99 for example and it says Tom scored 99 marks right so Tom is the default value here and 99 is uh overwritten uh or zero is overwritten by 99 which you passed okay so this is about default uh parameter passing now there is a concept of passing multiple parameters to a function and how you can pass these multiple parameter for example uh you I will take the same example of student and you want to pass some parameters so I want to pass uh name of the student and I want to pass multiple score of the student for example students has um scored uh you know marks in language marks in programming marks in maths or marks in some other subject and you want want to pass the parameters but you don't know the number of subject uh you know student uh is uh you know taking so what you can do in this condition you can just use the name as it is but for example you want to pass multiple scores you can just use estx and this estx says python that this parameter will be passed one as one parameter also or multiple parameters also so one or more parameter so estx says uh to the python that this score can be multiple also or even it can be uh one also okay and it's saying invalid invalid uh syntax let's see what's the error yeah I have forgotten the def keyword to define a function so I will Define a function Def and then I will call This And once again I can print uh for example I will print first of all name print name and then I will print score okay and I will just call this function for example student and I will pass uh name as uh once again Mark and scores for example he has taken uh language course so he scored 55 marks in this language course he has taken Math course he has scored 77 marks he has taken uh programming course he scored 90 marks he has taken other courses physics 67 marks or multiple courses okay so this is a wild card kind of Entry which says you can pass one or more parameters right and you see it has printed first of all the name of the student which is Mark and then these these marks as a tuple if you don't know what is a tuple tle is just like a list but you cannot edit a list or you cannot even delete an element from a list you can just read this element from Tuple right so tle is just like a list but the only difference is you cannot modify or delete any elements from this stle so this is uh tle right so in this way you can uh even uh pass multiple values using this estx and it's not necessary that you need to pass only two parameters you can just pass one parameter for example dep score something like this asri score it will be valid I forgot this called colon like this and what's the problem here so okay I left some indent here which it's saying unexpected indentation okay and you want to print score and it will be totally valid when you uh call this function score and you can pass multiple values one comma 3 some some marks multiple marks right and it will give you a topple so in this way you can pass default parameters to a function and you can pass multiple parameters to a function in Python I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for now
