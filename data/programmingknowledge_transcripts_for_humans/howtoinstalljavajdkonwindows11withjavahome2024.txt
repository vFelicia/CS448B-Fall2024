00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install and set up Java
00:03 - on your windows 11 operating system so
00:06 - let's see how we can do it so first of
00:08 - all we are going to check whether Java
00:10 - is installed on our Windows operating
00:12 - system already or not for that simple
00:14 - check is to uh just open your command
00:17 - prompt so just search for CMD in your
00:20 - search bar and then uh click on this
00:22 - option which says command prompt and
00:24 - here just type Java space hyphen hyphen
00:28 - version and then press enter and if it
00:30 - says Java is not recognized as an
00:33 - internal or external command that means
00:35 - Java is most probably not installed on
00:37 - your windows 11 operating system so
00:40 - let's uh install Java so for that you
00:43 - just need to open your favorite browser
00:45 - and search for Oracle Java download and
00:47 - the first link which will appear here
00:48 - will be from oracle.com so just click on
00:51 - this link I'm going to provide this link
00:53 - in the description of this video also so
00:55 - you can directly click on the link and
00:57 - reach to this website here at the time
01:00 - of making this video three versions are
01:02 - available Java 22 Java 21 and Java 17 we
01:06 - are going to install the Java 22 which
01:09 - is the latest version so just click on
01:11 - the Java 22 Tab and then click on
01:14 - Windows here we are going to download
01:16 - the MSI installer so select the link
01:19 - which is in front of MSI installer I'm
01:22 - going to click on this link which is
01:24 - going to start the download of this MSI
01:27 - file so once this MSI file will be
01:31 - downloaded you just need to click on
01:34 - this MSI file so you can see it's
01:37 - downloaded now so I'm going to click on
01:39 - this MSI file and minimize my browser so
01:42 - now the installation wizard of java SE
01:45 - development kit has been started so here
01:48 - click on next button and this will be
01:51 - the default location where Java will be
01:53 - installed on your Windows operating
01:55 - system so if you don't have the good
01:57 - reason to change this location just
01:59 - leave it as default and then click on
02:01 - next here and this is going to give you
02:03 - this kind of warning which says do you
02:05 - want to allow this app to make changes
02:06 - on your device I'm going to click on yes
02:08 - here which is going to start the
02:10 - installation process and in few seconds
02:13 - this installation process will be
02:14 - finished so just wait for a few seconds
02:17 - and you can see the message which says
02:20 - Java SE development kit successfully
02:22 - installed that means it's installed
02:24 - successfully if you want to access some
02:27 - tutorials or API documentation you can
02:29 - click on next steps button otherwise
02:32 - click on the close button in my case I'm
02:34 - going to click on the close button now
02:37 - once again we are going to open the
02:39 - command prompt to check whether Java
02:41 - command is now recognized or not so I'm
02:43 - going to once again search for CMD and
02:46 - then open the command prompt here and
02:49 - then I'm going to give this command once
02:51 - again which is Java space hyphen hyphen
02:54 - version and then press
02:57 - enter and this time you can see Java
03:00 - command is recognized so here you can
03:04 - see the Java version which I have
03:06 - installed is 20
03:09 - 22.0.1 so now Java is installed on your
03:13 - windows 11 operating system now some
03:15 - applications also requires Java home to
03:19 - be set in our environment variables on
03:21 - our Windows operating system so that
03:24 - they can recognize the Java folder so
03:27 - let's see how we can set the Java home
03:29 - envir IR M variable so just go to your
03:33 - folder Explorer and then click on the C
03:35 - drive here and then click on program
03:39 - files here and then click on Java folder
03:42 - here and click on the jdk version you
03:45 - see here I'm going to click on jdk 22
03:48 - and then you need to copy this path from
03:52 - here and then search for environment
03:57 - here which is going to show you this
03:59 - kind of of result which says edit the
04:02 - system environment varibles so I'm going
04:04 - to click on this option which is going
04:06 - to show me this kind of system
04:08 - properties window click on environment
04:10 - variables here and then select the path
04:13 - environment variable and then click on
04:16 - okay and this environment variable which
04:20 - you see here which is something like C
04:23 - program files common files Oracle Java
04:26 - Java path this is done by our Java inst
04:29 - installer right so if you don't see this
04:34 - kind of path then Java command will not
04:36 - be recognized to set the Java home
04:39 - environment variable you can go under
04:42 - user variables for your user and then
04:45 - click on new here and then in the
04:48 - variable name just write Java uncore
04:52 - home all in capital and then the path
04:56 - value here will be the path which you
04:58 - have copied which is until jdk hyphen
05:03 - the version you have downloaded right so
05:06 - this is the path which we have copied
05:08 - from here once you have provided this
05:10 - path click on okay and then click on
05:14 - okay here and once again click on okay
05:17 - which is going to set the environment
05:18 - variable for your Java home so once you
05:21 - have set the Java home environment
05:23 - variable and you can see this kind of
05:25 - output when you give the Java version
05:28 - command then we can also test whether
05:31 - everything is working or Not by creating
05:33 - a very simple
05:35 - JavaScript and then compiling it and
05:38 - then running the output for that so for
05:41 - that what I'm going to do is I'm going
05:42 - to close this uh terminal and then I'm
05:46 - going to go to my folder Explorer and go
05:49 - to the location where I want to create
05:51 - my Java projects so I want to create a
05:55 - Java directory inside my documents
05:57 - folder so I'm going to go inside my doc
05:59 - doucment folder right click here and
06:01 - then let me create a folder and I'm
06:04 - going to name my folder as Java apps for
06:08 - example and then press enter and then
06:10 - I'm going to go inside this folder and
06:12 - I'm going to create a new Java file now
06:15 - right click on this uh folder and then
06:18 - select new and then we are going to
06:20 - select text document here and first of
06:23 - all we need to give the name to our Java
06:26 - file so I'm going to name my Java file
06:28 - as hello and the extension here will be
06:32 - uh Java instead of txt so just write
06:34 - Java and then press enter and it's going
06:37 - to show you this kind of warning that if
06:39 - you change the file name extension the
06:42 - file might become unusable I'm going to
06:45 - click on yes here and my Java file is
06:49 - created now generally uh you can use
06:52 - some kind of IDE or editor for example
06:55 - Visual Studio code or your intelligent
06:58 - idea IDE to create these Java files you
07:01 - don't need to create it using this way
07:04 - but I'm assuming that you don't have any
07:06 - experience in programming and you don't
07:08 - have any IDE or Editor to create your
07:11 - Java file that's why I'm showing you the
07:14 - most uh raw way of doing this stuff if
07:18 - you don't see do Java extension here you
07:20 - can click on view here and then select
07:23 - show here and then select file name
07:26 - extension from here so this option
07:28 - should be checked here and then only you
07:30 - will see the extension Java here so once
07:34 - my Java file is created I'm going to
07:35 - right click on it and then I'm going to
07:37 - select open with and then I'm going to
07:40 - choose the app I'm going to choose the
07:43 - notepad in this case so select notepad
07:46 - and then click on okay which is going to
07:48 - open this Java file in the notepad and
07:51 - once this file is open just paste a very
07:53 - simple hello world uh program here so
07:57 - this uh Java hello world program you can
08:00 - find anywhere on internet but you need
08:02 - to remember few things here so this
08:05 - hello class name should be same as your
08:10 - file name right so you can see I have
08:12 - created the hello. Java file and then I
08:16 - have created this uh program here and
08:19 - the class name is also hello here with
08:23 - the capital H so make sure that this
08:25 - name and this name should match right
08:29 - otherwise you might face some problems
08:32 - once your program is created save your
08:35 - file and then close the file once you
08:38 - have saved your uh Java program you can
08:41 - once again open the command prompt and
08:44 - here and here you can copy this path
08:47 - where your Java file is there and then
08:49 - go to your terminal and write CD and
08:52 - then paste your path and then press
08:53 - enter and now you are inside your uh
08:58 - Java apps folder in the command prompt
09:01 - right so let me arrange this uh command
09:03 - prompt and this folder side by side so
09:05 - you can see the output of the command
09:07 - also so to compile this hello. Java file
09:10 - you can use this Java C command which is
09:13 - for compiling the Java file and then
09:16 - space and then you need to give the name
09:19 - of your file in my case it's hello. Java
09:22 - and then press enter and what it does is
09:25 - it's going to compile your uh Java
09:28 - program and it's going to give you this
09:29 - kind of output which is in the form of
09:32 - hello. class this is the output of your
09:36 - Java program and now you can run this
09:39 - hello uh class binary by using the Java
09:43 - command so just write Java previously we
09:45 - have used the Java C to compile the Java
09:49 - program to run the Java app you use the
09:52 - Java command and after Java just write
09:55 - hello here you don't need to give the
09:57 - dot class extension here you just write
10:00 - Java and the name of the file not the
10:02 - extension of the file and then press
10:05 - enter and it's going to give you the
10:07 - output of your uh program which is Hello
10:11 - World here right so everything is
10:14 - working fine in this way you can run
10:16 - your Java programs using the command
10:19 - prompt also so this is how you can
10:22 - install and set up Java jdk on your
10:25 - Windows operating system I hope you've
10:27 - enjoyed this video and I will see you
10:29 - see you in the next video
