00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part or last part of
00:06 - our PHP REST API tutorial and in this
00:09 - video guys we're going to continue
00:11 - working with our function delete okay so
00:16 - we have added this function before or
00:18 - from the previous video so public
00:21 - function delete and we have setup the
00:23 - query to delete the record from our
00:26 - database we have prepared the statement
00:29 - and then we also have the mechanism to
00:32 - clean the data so as you can see and
00:34 - then this right this part right here is
00:38 - binding the ID parameter to our query
00:43 - and this part is to execute the actual
00:48 - query and if there's an error so we
00:51 - should be printing or the error here and
00:54 - guys the next step is to create another
00:57 - file here under our API so new file and
01:01 - then this should be delete that PHP okay
01:07 - and in here we're going to add some
01:11 - logic and add some lines and and and I
01:15 - think we could just copy what we have in
01:17 - our update dot PHP and as you can see
01:19 - here we have the code or lines of code
01:26 - for our update so let's go ahead and
01:28 - copy all this and paste it in or delete
01:31 - that page 55 so in here we're gonna
01:35 - change a couple of things so it's a for
01:38 - example the allow methods so instead of
01:41 - using put it should be delete right
01:44 - there and of course initializing our API
01:47 - by using the initialize that PHP
01:49 - instantiate the post class by using this
01:53 - particular line and supplying the
01:55 - database connection that we have
01:57 - configured with our initialize that PHP
02:00 - and then of course we're getting the
02:01 - data that that has been posted by the
02:04 - user or by the request so as you can see
02:07 - we are getting the data by using the
02:12 - code and if I
02:13 - get contents and PHP input so I think
02:16 - other information like just like the
02:19 - category ID the author and body and of
02:22 - course the title is not needed here
02:24 - because we're only concerned with the ID
02:28 - that has been passed by the user or the
02:31 - request itself so we're assigning the
02:35 - attribute ID by getting the data ID just
02:39 - like that and as you can see we have
02:41 - created the delete function so we're
02:44 - just going to update our delete dot PHP
02:47 - instead of using update function because
02:51 - this is a feature for delete it should
02:53 - be of course the delete function there
02:56 - and change the message so instead of
02:59 - updated it should be post deleted okay
03:05 - and of course this one will be post not
03:08 - deleted so I think that's all for this
03:12 - file delete that page B so just save the
03:14 - post that page B and of course that
03:17 - delete that page B so we'll try real
03:19 - quick this particular feature with our
03:22 - postman API so let's go ahead and open
03:25 - up our postman software and try to check
03:29 - if our feature really works
03:33 - as I've said guys from my previous
03:35 - videos if you're working with an API and
03:41 - we're trying to get around or to be
03:45 - comfortable with an API be familiar with
03:49 - how API works so post months off there
03:52 - can really help you with all the
03:55 - activities that you want with an API so
03:58 - basically we have read that page P you
04:03 - have read single we also have the update
04:06 - dot PHP so if you try to run or read
04:13 - that PHP we should be able to get all
04:15 - the records for coming from our database
04:18 - as you can see here and of course we're
04:21 - dealing with delete maybe we could just
04:24 - create a
04:28 - a certain record for it now or maybe
04:32 - we'll just delete certain post just like
04:35 - this one ID equals to 5 so we'll try
04:38 - that ID is 5 so we'll just copy this and
04:43 - then create a new tab here in our
04:45 - postman software make sure that the
04:48 - method is delete and of course the
04:51 - defile that we want is the delete that
04:54 - PHP and of course we're going to supply
04:57 - the ID of the record that we want to
05:03 - delete and as you can see we have the ID
05:06 - as 5 okay so we're just going to go grab
05:10 - that and set the ID was to 5 just to
05:15 - check if we can really delete the post
05:19 - with the ID 5 so sin so we have an error
05:26 - here let's try to trying to get property
05:32 - of a non object so line 17 over delete
05:38 - that PHP 9 17 post ID and theta ID so
05:49 - [Music]
05:50 - also we're getting the idea from data ID
05:54 - and as you can see we're using PHP input
05:57 - so instead of supplying directly the ID
06:00 - here it should be declared in the body
06:04 - of the request so let's try that local
06:10 - host PHP yeah let's go to our body of
06:18 - our post and then raw okay so in here
06:25 - we're going to supply the ID instead of
06:30 - directly setting the ID equals here so
06:34 - this will be ID and then of course
06:41 - the value which is five okay so send a
06:46 - request so tap-in as you can see we have
06:52 - here a message post deleted so we should
06:57 - not be able to or we won't be able to
06:59 - view or get the data that is that has
07:05 - the idea of five so try that so as you
07:08 - can see the record that has the idea of
07:12 - five is now gone okay so basically we're
07:18 - just deleting the record by supplying
07:23 - the parameter in our request body so I
07:28 - think that concludes our PHP rest api
07:33 - tutorial and ii c we have fully
07:37 - functions or we have now the full
07:41 - function of our PHP rest api so we have
07:44 - the create delete read single read that
07:47 - PHP and of course the update so if you
07:50 - want because as you can see there is
07:53 - also the category for our post so we
07:56 - have to cut the post and then the
07:58 - category of our post so we could also
08:01 - create another file for our category to
08:06 - be able to have the read update the read
08:11 - single and also the delete function for
08:14 - our categories but it I think it's a it
08:16 - is pretty easy because the category has
08:19 - only two or three attributes the ID and
08:23 - then the name and of course the created
08:26 - add attribute so you can if you want you
08:32 - can create it on your own you can start
08:35 - by creating the read that PHP update
08:41 - that PHP for this particular modal
08:45 - category that PHP so I think for now
08:49 - I'll just guide you for the
08:55 - single or read that function for our
08:59 - category that PHP so we're going to
09:02 - create another class for this so I'm
09:06 - just going to copy right here and then
09:12 - here so where's our get their category
09:19 - that PHP and instead of using the post
09:23 - it should be a category so this is for
09:27 - our category table so we have construct
09:33 - or the pigs and the DB connection and of
09:36 - course the read and we need to close the
09:38 - territory class right there okay and
09:43 - instead of using the post table we
09:46 - should be able to or we should use the
09:49 - category category table in our database
09:53 - and of course as I've said there are
09:55 - only three properties for our category
10:05 - so the ID the name and of course the
10:10 - create of that great okay okay so I
10:18 - think this is Pythagoras instead of
10:22 - category categories there you go
10:25 - and create to that and then we have
10:29 - constructor with DB parameter or the
10:32 - connection parameter and in here instead
10:36 - of having this join query we can just us
10:41 - create or query all the attributes from
10:46 - our table name categories and we don't
10:49 - want or we don't need this particular
10:52 - part right here so select all from
10:56 - categories and then we're executing the
10:59 - query there you go and in here in our
11:03 - API we can just say
11:06 - read all categories that way HP and of
11:12 - course we can just copy the code that we
11:16 - have here in our post dot read dot PHP
11:22 - so that will be read all the categories
11:27 - and start up using post here we should
11:33 - say category okay and then passing the
11:38 - DB connection and then reading or what
11:43 - is the method so I think we also use
11:46 - read write so read okay and then we have
11:56 - the ID the name and of course I think we
12:07 - only have eight odd in our table in our
12:11 - database and you can just remove this
12:18 - great at okay and for e to that it
12:25 - should be created at so basically we can
12:28 - just delete all others and we should be
12:32 - able to see our categories okay so
12:37 - category is no categories found if there
12:41 - is no record found for our category so
12:43 - let's do that and try that with our
12:46 - postman API for post months off there
12:50 - okay and try to check if we have a
12:55 - functional read for our categories so
13:03 - here new tab it up there you can copy
13:11 - this and make sure it's another request
13:14 - API and we have
13:17 - the file read all underscore categories
13:21 - and then it should be get and then send
13:26 - so we have an earner class category not
13:31 - found let's try that because we haven't
13:35 - initialized our class category in our
13:38 - initialized at PHP so let's do that with
13:43 - this line category that PHP and save
13:48 - that and go back to post once off there
13:50 - and send undefined variable crated add
13:55 - in all categories 26
13:58 - that's because huh 26 8 and I so it
14:11 - should be create odd okay and then send
14:17 - so there you go as you can see we can
14:20 - now read the categories from our
14:22 - database so guys it's your turn now to
14:27 - make the other functions like the read
14:30 - the update reading of a single one and
14:33 - of course deleting a single record from
14:35 - our database so guys that concludes our
14:38 - PHP rest api tutorial and I hope you

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part or last part of our PHP REST API tutorial and in this video guys we're going to continue working with our function delete okay so we have added this function before or from the previous video so public function delete and we have setup the query to delete the record from our database we have prepared the statement and then we also have the mechanism to clean the data so as you can see and then this right this part right here is binding the ID parameter to our query and this part is to execute the
