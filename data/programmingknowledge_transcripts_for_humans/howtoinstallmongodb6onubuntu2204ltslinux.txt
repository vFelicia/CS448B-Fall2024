02:07 - this file you can use your terminal so
02:11 - just click on show applications icon
02:14 - here and then open your terminal by

02:30 - folder by just typing CD
02:33 - downloads and then press enter and now
02:37 - you are in your downloads folder right
02:40 - so in order to uh run this file let me
02:44 - just LS in this directory so you can see
02:49 - all the files in that downloads folder
02:52 - directory and we want to execute this
02:55 - file which is dot Deb file right so I
02:59 - can run this dot the EB file using this
03:01 - command just write sudo
03:04 - dpkg hyphen I and the name of your file
03:08 - so you can just write M and then press
03:12 - tab it's going to auto complete the file
03:16 - name right so you can just write mongodb
03:19 - and then press Tab Key on your keyboard
03:22 - and your file name will be Auto
03:25 - completed and then press enter and give
03:28 - your ubuntu's password so I'm going to
03:31 - provide my ubuntu's password and then
03:33 - press enter
03:34 - and it's going to start the installation
03:37 - of mongodb
03:39 - so now mongodb has been installed on our
03:43 - Ubuntu operating system
03:44 - so let's see the status of mongodben if
03:49 - it's running after installing a mongodb
03:52 - so when you install mongodb you need to
03:56 - start the mongodb service in order to
04:00 - start the mongodb server right so in
04:04 - order to check the status of the mongodb
04:07 - service let's see what's the command for
04:10 - that so to check the status just write
04:13 - sudo and then system CTL so just write
04:18 - the system
04:19 - CTL
04:21 - status and then the name of your service
04:26 - in our case the name of our service will
04:30 - be d right so just press enter
04:35 - here and you can see that mongodb
04:39 - database server is there but right now
04:43 - it's inactive or dead right so we need
04:47 - to start this service so in order to
04:49 - start this service you need to write
04:51 - this command sudo systemctl
04:54 - start and then D and then press
04:59 - enter which is going to start the
05:01 - Daemon on your Ubuntu operating system
05:05 - once again you're going to check the
05:07 - status of our Daemon service and
05:11 - this time you will see that the status
05:15 - is active or running after we started
05:19 - this mongodb right so now we have
05:22 - successfully installed mongodb server
05:25 - but how you can connect to the server
05:28 - and create some databases or view the
05:32 - data inside your database for that you
05:35 - will need a utility called sh if
05:39 - you want to use the command line tool or
05:43 - you can also download some kind of
05:46 - graphical user interface client also
05:49 - which is also available on mongodb
05:52 - website
05:53 - so you can once again go to the mongodb
05:56 - website where you have downloaded the
05:59 - community version here you can select
06:01 - products and then Select Community
06:04 - Edition
06:05 - and then when you scroll down
06:09 - you have already downloaded the mongodb
06:11 - server and then when you scroll down a
06:14 - little you will see tools right
06:17 - so under Tools you can see mongodb shell
06:22 - you also have mongodb Compass which is
06:25 - the mongodb client which is the
06:28 - graphical user interface client so let's
06:31 - try to install both of these clients the
06:34 - command line client and the graphical
06:37 - user interface so let's install the
06:40 - mongodb shell first so I'm going to
06:42 - select mongodb shell select the latest
06:45 - version from here and then platform is
06:48 - Ubuntu so this is okay for me
06:51 - and then the package type is dot dep
06:55 - just click on download which is going to
06:57 - start download and you know the
07:00 - procedure so once this dot the EB file
07:02 - is downloaded we are going to go to our
07:05 - downloads folder so let me clear this
07:09 - terminal and I'm already in my downloads
07:12 - folder if you are not you can just see
07:14 - the two your downloads folder and you
07:17 - can see this sh
07:20 - dot Deb file is downloaded so the
07:24 - command for installing is same just
07:26 - write sudo
07:28 - dpkg hyphen I and the name of your
07:32 - mongodb
07:34 - dot the EB file so just right click copy
07:38 - and right click paste here and then
07:42 - press enter which is going to start the
07:44 - download of sh or shell
07:48 - just wait for some time and you can see
07:50 -  shell is also installed
07:53 - once it's installed you can write this
07:56 - command which is sh to check the
08:01 - status so just write sh
08:04 - and if
08:05 - everything is working fine then this
08:09 -  sh command is going to connect to
08:13 - your default mongodb server which is
08:17 - running on your Local Host right so we
08:20 - have already uh installed mongodb server
08:24 - and it's it was already running
08:26 - so this client has recognized that and
08:30 - connected to your default mongodb server
08:34 - here you can write some commands like
08:38 - show DBS
08:42 - and it's going to show all the databases
08:45 - right if you want to create a database
08:47 - you can write use
08:49 - and the name of your database for
08:52 - example my DB and it's going to create
08:56 - that database for you
08:58 - but
09:00 - you need to insert some data in your
09:03 - database
09:04 - to view this database when you give this
09:07 - show DBS command so if you give show DBS
09:11 - you will not be able to see this command
09:14 - I should have written show
09:16 - the bees here
09:18 - and you can see still I don't see my DB
09:22 - in the list
09:23 - the reason is I have to insert some data
09:26 - into my database in order to view that
09:30 - database
09:32 - so in order to create a collection you
09:35 - can write this command DB dot create
09:39 - collection right so I just need to write
09:43 - db.38 collection and then in the
09:47 - parenthesis just give the name of your
09:49 - collection I'm going to name my
09:51 - collection as
09:53 - students for example and then press
09:56 - enter
09:57 - now in order to view the collections
09:59 - inside my database I can say show
10:03 - collections here and you can see I have
10:06 - one collection which is students
10:08 - collection right
10:09 - in order to insert data I can write DB
10:12 - dot The Collection name which is
10:17 - students in my case and then insert and
10:21 - then I can give adjacent value to insert
10:25 - data into it I can so I can insert the
10:28 - data using these curly brackets and then
10:31 - I can say name
10:35 - colon
10:37 - whatever name I want to give here right
10:40 - so just insert the data using this
10:44 - command
10:45 - and once the data is inserted you can
10:49 - see when you give show DBS command you
10:53 - will be able to see my DB is there right
10:57 - so shell is working let's also
11:01 - install mongodb compass
11:03 - so once again go to the mongodb website
11:07 - and then click on product click on
11:10 - Community Edition
11:12 - and then under Tools
11:16 - you will be able to see this mongodb
11:19 - Compass here mongodb Compass which is a
11:22 - GUI I'm going to click on that and then
11:25 - here I can select the stable version and
11:29 - then select my operating system which is
11:32 - Ubuntu 64-bit and then I can select this
11:38 - package format which is dot dep right
11:42 - so just click on this download button
11:46 - which is going to download this mongodb
11:49 - Compass dot Deb file once this dot Deb
11:53 - file is downloaded the procedure for
11:56 - installing mongodb Compass is also very
12:00 - easy just CD to your downloads folder
12:05 - just give LS command to view what is the
12:08 - name of the mongodb compass dot the EB
12:11 - file you can see this is the file which
12:13 - we have downloaded
12:15 - in order to run this just write sudo
12:19 - dpkg
12:22 - hyphen I and the name of your file which
12:24 - is this one so I'm going to right click
12:26 - copy and right click paste and then
12:29 - press enter and give my ubuntu's
12:32 - password
12:33 - and then press enter which is going to
12:36 - install mongodb compass on my Ubuntu
12:40 - operating system once mongodb Compass is
12:43 - installed
12:44 - you can see I can use this command which
12:47 - is mongodb hyphen Compass or I can go to
12:52 - uh the application section so just click
12:55 - on show applications
12:57 - and here I can see this mongodb Compass
13:00 - uh icon I can also search for
13:04 - mongodb and you can see mongodb
13:07 - compasses here so just open mongodb
13:09 - compass
13:10 - uh using this uh icon
13:14 - and once mongodb Compass has been
13:17 - started
13:18 - you just need to connect to your
13:20 - database so the default mongodb server
13:24 - is running on localhost
13:27 - 27017 Port just click on connect
13:31 - and you will be able to see all your
13:33 - databases you can see we have created
13:36 - mydb database and one collection here
13:40 - and our collection is there and we have
13:43 - just inserted one document inside our
13:45 - collection which was the name and it's
13:49 - there right
13:51 - so this is how you can view your mongodb
13:56 - data using this graphical user interface
13:59 - also from here you can also create the
14:02 - databases and collections
14:04 - so let me create one more collection
14:06 - which will be called let's say analytics
14:11 - and the
14:13 - collection name will be let's say sensor
14:17 - right and then from mongodb 5 you can
14:22 - also Define what type of collection you
14:25 - want so so from mongodb 5 onwards you
14:28 - can also create time series collection
14:31 - we don't want to create time series
14:32 - collection for now I'm going to just
14:35 - click on create database
14:37 - and you can see this database is created
14:39 - okay
14:41 - so this is how you can download and
14:43 - install mongodb server mongodb shell and
14:47 - mongodb compass on your Ubuntu operating
14:50 - system I hope you've enjoyed this video
