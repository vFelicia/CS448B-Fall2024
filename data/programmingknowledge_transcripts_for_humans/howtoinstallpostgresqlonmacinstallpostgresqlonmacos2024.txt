06:16 - going to give the same password here and
06:18 - then I'm going to click on save password
06:20 - and then click on okay which is going to
06:23 - connect to my post SQL server and then I

06:30 - here so here under databases the default
06:32 - database is the post grade database and
06:36 - then under the post gray you will be
06:38 - able to see the list of tables the
06:41 - default post gr database doesn't have
06:43 - any tables but uh when you create a new
06:46 - table then you will be able to see the
06:48 - database under the table right so from
06:52 - here you can also create a new database
06:54 - so let's create a database and I'm going
06:57 - to name this database as
06:59 - demo for example you can also change the
07:03 - owner and you can also provide some
07:06 - other configuration for your database
07:08 - like definition security parameter and
07:10 - other things for now I just want to
07:12 - create a simple demo database so I can
07:15 - just uh write this uh name here and then
07:19 - click on Save which is going to create
07:21 - this database right and then when you
07:25 - select the demo database and go under
07:27 - schema so click on schema
07:29 - and here you will see the public schema
07:33 - and then under public uh you can see the
07:37 - table so you don't have any table here
07:40 - right now so I can create a new table
07:43 - and I'm going to name my table as for
07:47 - example names table I can also provide
07:50 - the columns here so here let's provide
07:54 - let's say the ID column and then the
07:57 - data type for that so I'm going to
08:00 - choose integer here and then you can
08:04 - also choose if it's a primary key or not
08:06 - so let's say it's a primary key and then
08:09 - I'm going to provide the second uh
08:12 - column which is for example name and the
08:16 - type will be let's say text here okay so
08:20 - you can also search for text type and
08:23 - then you can save this table which is
08:27 - going to create this table and then you
08:30 - have the column which is name now you
08:33 - can once again right click on the table
08:35 - and then if you have some data you can
08:37 - select the view option and then click on
08:40 - all rows which is going to show you the
08:42 - content of all rows in that table so
08:45 - this is how you can install postc SQL on
08:48 - your Mac operating system and use PG
08:52 - admin to connect to your database I hope
