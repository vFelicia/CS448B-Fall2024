00:00 - hello guys welcome to the fifth video
00:02 - tutorial on Python programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:06 - show you how you can save your program
00:09 - or how you can save your Python program
00:12 - to use this program in the future so for
00:16 - example um you want to save your Python
00:20 - program and run it uh uh whenever you
00:23 - need in future how you can do it I'm
00:25 - going to show you in this video so till
00:28 - now we were using this python shell and
00:31 - whatever code we uh write in this Fon
00:33 - shell it will execute this uh code very
00:37 - well but it's not able to save your
00:40 - program so whenever you just close this
00:43 - python shell your program is gone it's
00:45 - and is not saved anywhere so let's try
00:49 - to make uh a new file or new python file
00:55 - so that we can use this python file
00:57 - whenever we need and we don't even need
01:00 - to worry about closing this shell okay
01:03 - so how you can do this is you just need
01:06 - to open this python shell you already
01:08 - know that you can just open this python
01:10 - Shell by going to your python folder and
01:14 - just open idle python GUI from here and
01:17 - this is that idle idle python GUI which
01:20 - is a python shell so just open it and
01:23 - just go to file here and just click new
01:26 - file and this will open a new file and
01:30 - you can save this file as a python file
01:33 - but first you need to write some code in
01:35 - here so I'm just giving you an example
01:38 - how you can make this python file and
01:40 - how you can run it so for example we
01:43 - want to calculate the maximum of three
01:46 - values what you can do here is uh you
01:50 - can calculate the maximum of three
01:52 - [Music]
01:55 - values like this so I have already shown
02:00 - you how you can uh take the input by
02:03 - using this input function and how you
02:06 - can convert this input to an integer by
02:09 - just typ casting this uh string value
02:12 - which you get from the input to the
02:15 - integer and save it into a variable so
02:18 - in the same way we I have three variable
02:21 - x y and Zed which are taking inputs from
02:24 - the user and what I'm going to do is I'm
02:27 - just simply calculating the max maximum
02:30 - value of these three number which you
02:32 - have user has entered and I'm going to
02:35 - print this maximum so maximum I'm
02:38 - calculating this from a function called
02:40 - Max which I have shown you in the last
02:42 - video it can take any number of argument
02:45 - right now I have only three argument
02:48 - because I want to compare three numbers
02:49 - and calculate the maximum value so let's
02:53 - try to save this first so you just need
02:56 - to save this program in order to run it
02:58 - so you just need to go go to file and
03:01 - just click save as and in here choose
03:04 - your path for the python file and just
03:08 - WR give the name of your python file for
03:11 - example test and make sure that this
03:15 - here save as type is python file here
03:19 - which is py file or pyw file and save
03:24 - your file and now once your file is
03:27 - saved you can just run it just go to
03:30 - this Run tab and you can just click this
03:33 - run module or F5 key okay so I'm going
03:38 - to run module and this will run my
03:40 - module like this so I'm going to give uh
03:43 - three numbers for example 22 second
03:46 - number 33 third number 44 and it gives
03:51 - me the answer that maximum of these
03:53 - three values is 44 right I can uh do
03:57 - this uh in a better way that I can can
04:01 - print something first that the result is
04:05 - or
04:08 - the max of
04:13 - three
04:16 - three values
04:20 - is and it depends upon you how you can
04:23 - run this is just an example okay so how
04:26 - do you want to make your program you are
04:29 - free to make it and this is just an
04:31 - example how you can save your file but
04:34 - still uh it doesn't solve our purpose
04:37 - because it's uh running our code in the
04:41 - shell and we cannot you know uh always
04:45 - uh run our program and you we cannot
04:49 - open our python shell everywhere you
04:52 - know you want to run your python file as
04:55 - an executable file right you don't don't
04:58 - need to uh you know open this python
05:01 - shell every time you need to run your
05:03 - Python program and how you can run your
05:07 - program directly
05:10 - is you just need to go to the folder
05:14 - wherever you
05:15 - have saved your python file so I have
05:19 - saved my python file here but there is a
05:22 - little correction you need to make in
05:24 - this program and what is the correction
05:28 - because it's taking three inputs and it
05:31 - will take the three inputs and it's
05:33 - going to print this uh answer and just
05:38 - after uh you know uh giving you the
05:40 - answer or printing the answer
05:43 - it'll instantly exit so what you need to
05:46 - do just need to give something so that
05:50 - it can stay so just write
05:54 - input and this is
05:58 - input and in here you can just give a
06:02 - string that
06:05 - please
06:07 - press enter
06:10 - to exit and this will you know keep your
06:15 - screen on and until and unless you press
06:18 - enter it will not exit just save your
06:22 - program once again just go to file and
06:24 - save it and then go to the python file
06:27 - wherever you have saved your your python
06:30 - file okay just go to the python file you
06:33 - can right click
06:34 - and you can
06:37 - open if you going to if you are going to
06:40 - open it it will open it in the python
06:44 - terminal and this will run your program
06:47 - directly you don't even need to use this
06:49 - python shell or what you can do you can
06:52 - just directly double click it and it
06:53 - will open your Python program and it
06:56 - will give you the option please enter
06:58 - first number I will enter first number
07:01 - 11 second number 33 third number
07:06 - 43 and when I press enter it will give
07:09 - me the answer which is 43 the max of
07:12 - three values is 43 and now it will give
07:16 - me uh this option that
07:19 - press enter to exit and when I press
07:24 - enter or any other
07:26 - key I will exit from my python code okay
07:32 - so once again you can save your python
07:35 - file by going to this uh uh file Tab and
07:39 - make a new file and just save your file
07:42 - once you have done uh writing your code
07:46 - you just need to save your file as a py
07:48 - file so you just need to go to uh file
07:51 - and save as and you just need to give a
07:55 - name to your file and make sure that
07:57 - it's a python uh uh file type okay and
08:02 - once your file is uh ready you just need
08:04 - to or once your code is ready you just
08:06 - need to save it and once you have saved
08:10 - your file you just need to go to the
08:13 - file and run it if you have remembered I
08:16 - have shown you in the first video uh
08:19 - that python uh doesn't compile your
08:24 - program python directly runs your
08:27 - program so you don't need to compile
08:30 - your program it will run your program
08:33 - directly okay and if any error occurs in
08:37 - your program it'll uh give you the
08:40 - answer at the run time but and not at
08:43 - the compile time so this is why you can
08:45 - run your python file directly like this
08:48 - by double clicking okay so I hope you
08:51 - have enjoyed this video please wait
08:52 - comment and subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the fifth video tutorial on Python programming for beginners and in this video I'm going to show you how you can save your program or how you can save your Python program to use
