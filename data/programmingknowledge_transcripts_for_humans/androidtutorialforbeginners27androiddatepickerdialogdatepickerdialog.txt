00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - to use date picker dialogue in Android
00:09 - so let's get started first of all I'm
00:12 - going to take a button and I'm going to
00:14 - change the text of this button as show
00:16 - date picker dialogue and when I click
00:19 - this button the date picker dialogue
00:21 - will appear and we will be able to
00:23 - select some date using this tape time
00:26 - picker and we can uh perform some action
00:30 - on the basis of this uh day selected
00:33 - okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm
00:36 - going to go to my Java folder and inside
00:38 - my Java folder I'm going to go to my
00:40 - main activity. Java and in here I'm
00:43 - going to declare first of all object of
00:45 - uh
00:46 - button BTN and then I'm going to declare
00:50 - three variables one for year one for
00:53 - month and one for the day of uh the
00:56 - month so
00:58 - int year
01:01 - X month
01:05 - X month should be month like this and
01:11 - the
01:13 - daycore X okay now one variable more I'm
01:19 - going to declare to hold the dialogue ID
01:22 - of uh our dialogue okay so I'm going to
01:27 - declare a stat
01:30 - take final
01:34 - int
01:36 - dialogue ID and I'm going to initialize
01:40 - this dialog ID by zero okay now what I'm
01:44 - going to do is I'm going to go below a
01:47 - little bit and I'm going to declare a
01:51 - method which I will call inside my own
01:54 - create method so this uh method will be
01:58 - a public method
02:00 - public void and I will name it as
02:05 - show dialogue method okay and inside my
02:10 - method first of all I'm going to uh cast
02:14 - my button so button which I have
02:17 - declared above is equal
02:22 - to
02:24 - button find view by ID r. ID
02:31 - dot
02:33 - button
02:34 - okay now I'm going to take this button
02:38 - instance or object and I'm going to call
02:41 - set on click method so
02:45 - BTN
02:46 - dot set on click
02:49 - listener and inside this we will call a
02:53 - new onclick
02:55 - listener and inside this onclick method
02:59 - what we are going to do is we are going
03:01 - to call our show dialogue uh which is a
03:07 - inbuilt method in uh you know Android so
03:11 - let's little bit change this uh method
03:14 - as show
03:16 - Dialogue
03:19 - on
03:22 - button click so that we will not be
03:26 - confused by this method which I'm going
03:29 - to uh right now right now
03:32 - so show
03:35 - dialogue and this takes the ID of the
03:38 - dialogue so we have declared the
03:41 - dialogue ID it should be dialogue ID so
03:45 - I will just copy this dialog ID which we
03:47 - have declared and pass it here okay now
03:52 - what I'm going to do is I will uh create
03:56 - or I will call uh on create dialogue
03:59 - method which is uh inil method so I'm
04:02 - just going to just copy this overwrite
04:05 - protected void on create just like this
04:10 - and just below I will go paste this and
04:14 - then on
04:15 - create
04:19 - dialogue and then inside this on create
04:26 - dialogue I'm going to write my code and
04:30 - I'm going to give one argument to this
04:33 - on create dialogue which will be an
04:35 - integer ID and if this integer or and
04:42 - this returns our dialogue right so we
04:45 - have to
04:47 - return dialogue here instead of void
04:50 - okay and now what I'm going to do is if
04:54 - this uh
04:56 - ID in oncreate dialogue is equal to
05:00 - the dialog ID which we have
05:02 - defined
05:04 - then I'm going to uh
05:08 - return a
05:10 - new dialogue okay so new uh which
05:14 - dialogue I'm going to return our new
05:17 - date picker dialogue
05:21 - okay so date picker dialogue and it
05:25 - takes few arguments and let's do Alt
05:30 - Enter so that it can fix our Imports and
05:34 - it takes few argument first is the
05:37 - context second is the date picker
05:41 - listener or date picker yeah you can say
05:44 - listener and we are going to Define our
05:47 - date picker listener later Let's uh give
05:50 - the name to this date picker listener as
05:55 - D
05:58 - picker listener for example okay and
06:02 - then the other argument it takes
06:05 - is
06:08 - year and then the
06:11 - month and then the day
06:16 - okay and if this ID doesn't match our
06:21 - dialogue ID I'm going to
06:26 - return null okay so if
06:29 - the ID doesn't matches I'm going to
06:32 - return a null okay and now what I'm
06:37 - going to do is here I'm going to declare
06:41 - this variable which is a date picker
06:44 - listener variable
06:47 - okay so I'm going to declare a private
06:50 - member private date picker
06:54 - dialog dot
06:57 - on date set list listner and then this
07:02 - will be our date set listner is equal
07:06 - to
07:08 - new
07:10 - on Dat set
07:12 - listner and it's going to automatically
07:15 - create uh this method for us when we
07:18 - enter press enter key and just don't
07:22 - remember to close this uh variable here
07:26 - by semicolon and inside this you can can
07:29 - see I can see year it in the on Dat set
07:34 - method arguments are year month of the
07:37 - year and date of the month or day of the
07:41 - month okay so what I can do is I can
07:44 - assign so I have declared three variable
07:47 - year X month X and day x right so I can
07:51 - use uh or I I can assign the value of uh
07:56 - year X is equal to this year
08:00 - which is uh taken by this D date picker
08:06 - dialogue right in the same way I'm going
08:09 - to take the value of month X is equal to
08:14 - month of
08:16 - year and I'm going to take the value of
08:19 - day x is equal
08:23 - to day of the month okay and now what I
08:28 - can do is I can display this uh year
08:31 - month and day using a toast or something
08:35 - other like text box or edit text or
08:38 - something like this right I'm going to
08:41 - choose uh toast so I'm going to take
08:44 - this toast dot make text and it takes uh
08:49 - first argument as the class context or
08:53 - context of this uh class
08:56 - itself
08:58 - so main activity.
09:01 - this and the second argument is
09:05 - the text itself so I can pass year first
09:11 - plus and then slash
09:15 - then
09:18 - month and then
09:21 - plus slash once again and then
09:26 - plus d x so it's going to show me the
09:31 - day
09:32 - date comma the third argument
09:37 - toast dot length short duration dot show
09:44 - okay now what I can do is I can call
09:48 - this show Dialogue on button click
09:52 - method so just copy this show dialogue
09:54 - which we have created just copy this uh
09:57 - method and call it inside your on create
10:01 - method here okay and that's it our code
10:06 - is done so we can run it I'm going to
10:08 - run my
10:09 - program so my program is running now and
10:13 - I can see this button and when I click
10:14 - this button I will be able to see the
10:17 - date but the date here whenever you
10:21 - select the date it will not be the
10:24 - current date because we haven't set any
10:27 - date to our
10:30 - date picker dialogue okay so what we can
10:33 - do is we can set date to our date picker
10:37 - dialogue which is the current date uh by
10:40 - using calendar class okay so what I'm
10:43 - going to do is I'm going to go to my
10:45 - code here and remember I have declared
10:49 - year month and day variables right and
10:54 - if somehow I can pass the current uh
10:58 - date to these three variables I will be
11:01 - able to see the current date in my date
11:05 - picker dialogue okay so what you can do
11:09 - is you can go inside your on create
11:12 - method and in here you can create an
11:16 - instance of a calendar
11:19 - final calendar Cal is equal to calendar
11:25 - do
11:27 - get instance
11:32 - and then I can use the scal to uh get
11:38 - the current year month and day okay so
11:44 - I'm going to take the
11:46 - year is equal
11:48 - to K do get and inside this I can take
11:56 - Cal and I will go back
11:59 - I will take calendar this
12:03 - one dot
12:07 - year it's going to give me year and then
12:10 - in the same way I can pass month also
12:15 - so
12:17 - k. get
12:20 - and K do month not March but
12:27 - dot month
12:30 - and the third variable is day of the
12:33 - month so day is equal to and I'm going
12:36 - to just copy this and this should
12:40 - be
12:42 - dot day of month
12:46 - okay in addition you need to do one more
12:50 - little thing here whenever you print
12:52 - your date using your toast you can uh
12:57 - you know get this month but uh by
13:00 - default month start from zero here okay
13:05 - so what you can do is you can add one to
13:08 - your month here and it will give you uh
13:12 - the correct month okay and now I'm going
13:15 - to run my
13:16 - program and my program is once again
13:19 - running so I'm going to click this and
13:22 - you can see the current date and the
13:26 - year and the month is showing here today
13:29 - is 25th of March 2015 and I can see uh
13:35 - and I can verify this date and then when
13:38 - I click okay I will be able to see this
13:41 - month date and year here okay so in this
13:46 - way you can use a date picker dialogue
13:48 - in your
13:50 - Android app I hope you have enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners in this video we will see how to use date picker dialogue in Android so let's get started first of all I'm going to take a button and I'm going to change the text of this button as show date picker dialogue and when I click this button the date picker dialogue will appear and we will be able to select some date using this tape time picker and we can uh perform some action on the basis of this uh day selected okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my Java folder and inside my Java folder I'm going to go to my main activity. Java and in here I'm going to declare first of all object of uh button BTN and then I'm going to declare three variables one for year one for month and one for the day of uh the month so int year X month X month should be month like this and the daycore X okay now one variable more I'm going to declare to hold the dialogue ID of uh our dialogue okay so I'm going to declare a stat take final int dialogue ID and I'm going to initialize this dialog ID by zero okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go below a little bit and I'm going to declare a method which I will call inside my own create method so this uh method will be a public method public void and I will name it as show dialogue method okay and inside my method first of all I'm going to uh cast my button so button which I have declared above is equal to button find view by ID r. ID dot button okay now I'm going to take this button instance or object and I'm going to call set on click method so BTN dot set on click listener and inside this we will call a new onclick listener and inside this onclick method what we are going to do is we are going to call our show dialogue uh which is a inbuilt method in uh you know Android so let's little bit change this uh method as show Dialogue on button click so that we will not be confused by this method which I'm going to uh right now right now so show dialogue and this takes the ID of the dialogue so we have declared the dialogue ID it should be dialogue ID so I will just copy this dialog ID which we have declared and pass it here okay now what I'm going to do is I will uh create or I will call uh on create dialogue method which is uh inil method so I'm just going to just copy this overwrite protected void on create just like this and just below I will go paste this and then on create dialogue and then inside this on create dialogue I'm going to write my code and I'm going to give one argument to this on create dialogue which will be an integer ID and if this integer or and this returns our dialogue right so we have to return dialogue here instead of void okay and now what I'm going to do is if this uh ID in oncreate dialogue is equal to the dialog ID which we have defined then I'm going to uh return a new dialogue okay so new uh which dialogue I'm going to return our new date picker dialogue okay so date picker dialogue and it takes few arguments and let's do Alt Enter so that it can fix our Imports and it takes few argument first is the context second is the date picker listener or date picker yeah you can say listener and we are going to Define our date picker listener later Let's uh give the name to this date picker listener as D picker listener for example okay and then the other argument it takes is year and then the month and then the day okay and if this ID doesn't match our dialogue ID I'm going to return null okay so if the ID doesn't matches I'm going to return a null okay and now what I'm going to do is here I'm going to declare this variable which is a date picker listener variable okay so I'm going to declare a private member private date picker dialog dot on date set list listner and then this will be our date set listner is equal to new on Dat set listner and it's going to automatically create uh this method for us when we enter press enter key and just don't remember to close this uh variable here by semicolon and inside this you can can see I can see year it in the on Dat set method arguments are year month of the year and date of the month or day of the month okay so what I can do is I can assign so I have declared three variable year X month X and day x right so I can use uh or I I can assign the value of uh year X is equal to this year which is uh taken by this D date picker dialogue right in the same way I'm going to take the value of month X is equal to month of year and I'm going to take the value of day x is equal to day of the month okay and now what I can do is I can display this uh year month and day using a toast or something other like text box or edit text or something like this right I'm going to choose uh toast so I'm going to take this toast dot make text and it takes uh first argument as the class context or context of this uh class itself so main activity. this and the second argument is the text itself so I can pass year first plus and then slash then month and then plus slash once again and then plus d x so it's going to show me the day date comma the third argument toast dot length short duration dot show okay now what I can do is I can call this show Dialogue on button click method so just copy this show dialogue which we have created just copy this uh method and call it inside your on create method here okay and that's it our code is done so we can run it I'm going to run my program so my program is running now and I can see this button and when I click this button I will be able to see the date but the date here whenever you select the date it will not be the current date because we haven't set any date to our date picker dialogue okay so what we can do is we can set date to our date picker dialogue which is the current date uh by using calendar class okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my code here and remember I have declared year month and day variables right and if somehow I can pass the current uh date to these three variables I will be able to see the current date in my date picker dialogue okay so what you can do is you can go inside your on create method and in here you can create an instance of a calendar final calendar Cal is equal to calendar do get instance and then I can use the scal to uh get the current year month and day okay so I'm going to take the year is equal to K do get and inside this I can take Cal and I will go back I will take calendar this one dot year it's going to give me year and then in the same way I can pass month also so k. get and K do month not March but dot month and the third variable is day of the month so day is equal to and I'm going to just copy this and this should be dot day of month okay in addition you need to do one more little thing here whenever you print your date using your toast you can uh you know get this month but uh by default month start from zero here okay so what you can do is you can add one to your month here and it will give you uh the correct month okay and now I'm going to run my program and my program is once again running so I'm going to click this and you can see the current date and the year and the month is showing here today is 25th of March 2015 and I can see uh and I can verify this date and then when I click okay I will be able to see this month date and year here okay so in this way you can use a date picker dialogue in your Android app I hope you have
