00:01 - hello everyone welcome to the new views
00:03 - tutorial
00:03 - so i again welcome you all to the new
00:05 - video tutorial
00:07 - and today we are going to build a date
00:09 - picker and a time picker and view js
00:11 - so let's get start with today's tutorial
00:13 - so air f3 files this is the official
00:16 - website of vue.js
00:17 - you can copy the cdn from here then you
00:20 - have bootstrap page
00:21 - then this is the our app directory so
00:23 - these are the two files app.html and
00:26 - app.js
00:27 - so we will be linking.html to app.js
00:30 - and then we would build our time picker
00:32 - then again then after that we would see
00:34 - the date picker
00:35 - so very two important components and
00:38 - these are very useful when we
00:39 - are opting for a slot scheduling or
00:42 - scheduling or something using a time or
00:44 - a date
00:44 - so they are very helpful so we can get
00:46 - start with that
00:48 - here now so before that we can move to
00:51 - the bootstrap page
00:52 - inside the starter template we can click
00:54 - on right side copy
00:55 - we can copy this html and paste it here
00:58 - you can remove this option too since
01:00 - this
01:01 - is not needed and then we can also
01:04 - remove this
01:05 - comments as well and we can
01:08 - save this and when we click on app.html
01:11 - we can see this page is perfectly
01:13 - working fine
01:15 - and we have a h1 heading then after this
01:18 - what we can do
01:19 - we need to add the cdn okay we will copy
01:22 - the cdn
01:23 - and we can paste it here and this is
01:27 - perfectly
01:28 - and when we refresh this page or ctrl
01:31 - shift i
01:31 - we can take inspect element and we can
01:34 - see on console that you are running a
01:36 - development build of view
01:38 - and this is what we needed as per our uh
01:40 - as per our desiration that we needed
01:42 - view to run a development mode
01:44 - uh development mode is a little bit
01:46 - different from the production mode that
01:48 - it gives us the warnings and console
01:49 - logs
01:50 - so that is helpful for us while building
01:53 - an
01:53 - application but if you want something
01:55 - very very much
01:56 - optimized then you should use production
01:58 - after the development that should be
02:00 - after the development
02:01 - now we can move to our page and we can
02:05 - change the title
02:07 - we can change this to view date
02:11 - date picker and time
02:14 - picker so this is perfectly fine
02:18 - and we can add a script
02:21 - below that script source is equal to
02:24 - have dot js perfectly fine and we can
02:27 - close the script tag and inside tab.js
02:30 - okay i'll remove this for a time me and
02:33 - i can simply type console.log
02:38 - so i uh i'll type console.log
02:41 - script started
02:46 - okay so when we refresh this page
02:49 - yeah so here you can see the script has
02:51 - started and plus we have built the page
02:54 - now what we can do you can first create
02:56 - our app component
02:58 - so this this constant my app
03:01 - so this is my component
03:05 - component here perfectly fine this organ
03:07 - json object
03:08 - and what i'll do constant
03:13 - my app is equal to view
03:19 - dot create app
03:23 - my component
03:26 - dot mount so i'll use dot mount for this
03:31 - and what i'll do i use dot mount
03:37 - and i'll use hash my app
03:41 - and this would here you can see that
03:44 - okay fail to mount an app target
03:46 - selector hash my app well this would be
03:48 - failure or because uh i have not defined
03:51 - a i'll move this heading and i'll not
03:55 - define
03:55 - a div here right now so there
03:58 - id is equal to my
04:02 - app
04:05 - and i would close this close this div
04:08 - and i would refresh this page now here
04:11 - you can see and i'll type
04:13 - my app
04:16 - dot data
04:20 - okay i'll put a dollar sign so
04:24 - so till now what i want to show you that
04:27 - since that we don't have any data that
04:29 - would be an empty object but this
04:31 - recognized as my app
04:32 - okay so it has all the view components
04:35 - like uh attributes and methods so
04:38 - what we defined here at the line number
04:41 - seven so this is perfectly fine
04:43 - now what we can do we need to define a
04:45 - data
04:46 - or methods is given by a json object so
04:50 - that would be empty we are not defining
04:52 - any methods and data would be a data
04:55 - constructor
04:56 - and we need to return
05:01 - return a json object
05:05 - and then what we do return a json object
05:09 - and
05:10 - we'll define my time
05:13 - we can define this on a null component
05:15 - and my date
05:17 - as a null component too
05:21 - so this is perfectly fine and let me
05:23 - refresh the page
05:26 - i got this at error line number though
05:28 - syntax error okay
05:30 - so app.js client number five column
05:34 - number 15
05:35 - okay okay i had a semicolon before the
05:39 - record statement so that would work for
05:41 - the issue so let me close this and
05:42 - refresh the page
05:44 - so i have something good so why my app
05:47 - dollar data so
05:51 - now you can see that this is our data
05:54 - and it has two target values that is my
05:57 - time and my date
05:58 - which are initially null so let's bind
06:01 - them using time picker
06:02 - so now i have input
06:07 - type is equal to time
06:12 - and then perfectly fine and then i'll
06:15 - type
06:16 - my time value but this won't work
06:19 - because i have to buy this using v
06:22 - model is equal to my time
06:26 - so let's close this page and okay i'll
06:29 - put this inside the h1 tag
06:34 - sorry people mistake h1 tag and
06:39 - uh yes
06:42 - my time
06:45 - now i'll refresh this page perfectly
06:47 - fine now using the arrow keys since this
06:50 - i'm using firefox you can
06:52 - change the time and then you can change
06:55 - the minutes
06:56 - now when i choose am this is a good
06:59 - this is am and i choose pm it
07:02 - automatically changes to 14
07:04 - when i make this as a change dynamically
07:07 - updated
07:08 - and i'll use am now so this works
07:10 - perfectly fine
07:11 - so this is how the time pickers work uh
07:14 - this is how time picker works and i'll
07:16 - comment this out now
07:18 - since we don't uh we'll move to the date
07:20 - picker
07:24 - for date picker what you can do input
07:27 - type
07:27 - is equal to date and
07:30 - we model i'll model this
07:34 - with my date and
07:38 - i close this tag and inside the h1 tag
07:42 - h1 i'll give my date
07:46 - and close this okay
07:49 - now when i refresh the page
07:54 - i'll choose choose a date so here i see
07:56 - when i choose a date perfectly fine i
07:58 - can choose the year
07:59 - and month so this changes and as the
08:03 - date also changes
08:05 - so month changes perfectly dynamically
08:07 - updating
08:08 - so everything is updated dynamically and
08:11 - this is how we build a date picker and
08:13 - time picker so thank everyone for
08:14 - watching this tutorial
08:16 - i'll come up with a few more tricks and
08:18 - tips in the upcoming tutorial so thank
08:19 - you everyone for watching
08:21 - using uh
