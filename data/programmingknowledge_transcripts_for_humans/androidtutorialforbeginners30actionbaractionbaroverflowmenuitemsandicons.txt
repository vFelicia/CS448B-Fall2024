00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners in the last video I have shown
00:07 - you how you can use or work with action
00:11 - bar and I have also shown you how you
00:14 - can add an icon to your action bar now
00:18 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:20 - you can add some menu items with icons
00:23 - to your action bar so first of all we
00:27 - need to have some icons in order to add
00:30 - it to our app so best way to find the
00:35 - icons to your action bar is to search on
00:38 - internet and just search for android
00:41 - icon packs here on your favorite browser
00:44 - and there is a website which is from
00:48 - android itself which is called
00:50 - developer.android.com slash design slash
00:55 - downloads so click this link here and
00:58 - you will reach to the android website so
01:02 - just click this material icon button
01:05 - here and in here you will be able to see
01:09 - many items which you can use in your app
01:12 - ok so for example I want to add this
01:16 - info icon to my action bar menu I can
01:19 - just select it and I can choose whether
01:22 - I want the white background or black
01:26 - background so because my action bar has
01:30 - black background so I can choose this
01:33 - white here okay so it's going to look
01:36 - like this and then I can select this PNG
01:41 - so it's going to download this into a
01:43 - PNG file so let's download it and we
01:48 - just need to save it for example I want
01:50 - the Settings icon from here so I can
01:53 - just select it use this white background
01:56 - and just click pngs
01:58 - and it's going to download it in the zip
02:02 - format so once you have saved your zip
02:05 - files you can go to the location where
02:07 - you have saved them and you can extract
02:10 - these files so I'm going to extract them
02:12 - at the same place and extract here and
02:16 - once you extract them you will be able
02:19 - to see these three folders and I'm going
02:22 - to go inside this Android folder and in
02:25 - here you can see a different resolution
02:28 - of PNG files so drawable hdpi drawable
02:33 - mdpi and other resolutions but for now
02:37 - I'm going to just use this hdpi image
02:40 - which is this one and what I'm going to
02:43 - do is I'm just going to copy this image
02:46 - from here copy and go to your Android
02:49 - studio
02:50 - go to your drawable right-click and
02:52 - paste it there okay
02:54 - so right-click and paste and it's going
02:58 - to ask in which folder you want to paste
03:01 - it I want to paste it in drawable hdpi
03:04 - okay and just click OK so it's going to
03:08 - add this picture here if you want or to
03:13 - add other resolution you know pictures
03:16 - to destroyable just do it in the same
03:18 - manner and now I'm going to go to my
03:23 - other folder which was settings and
03:26 - androids and draw hdpi right click and
03:30 - copy from here and go to your Android
03:33 - studio drawable paste it here and inside
03:37 - this drawable - hdpi
03:39 - and click OK so it's going to add these
03:42 - two pictures in your drawable folder so
03:47 - now we have our icons and we want to
03:51 - display them on our action bar so what
03:54 - we are going to do is we are going to
03:56 - create a new menu so let's click on this
04:01 - menu and right click on it and we are
04:03 - going to create new menu resource file
04:06 - and in here you just need to give some
04:11 - name for example main underscore
04:14 - activity underscore menu ok and click OK
04:19 - and it's going to create this menu
04:23 - resource file and inside this man
04:26 - new resource file you can add some items
04:29 - to your menu okay
04:31 - so first of all let's go to this main
04:34 - menu mean dot XML which was already
04:37 - present and we just need to copy this
04:40 - line from here so just copy this line
04:43 - and go to your new file which you have
04:46 - created and then paste it here now after
04:49 - adding we go here and we are going to
04:51 - add items here so item so let's add
04:54 - first of all the ID to our item so I'm
04:58 - going to just write Android and search
05:01 - for ID and in here I can give some ID to
05:05 - my icon for example I want to give some
05:08 - my ID to my info icon so I will just say
05:11 - info ID okay and once again you can add
05:14 - some more attributes for example title
05:17 - for your item so
05:20 - and then you can add some icon to your
05:24 - menu item
05:26 - okay so Android icon and go to drawable
05:29 - and inside drawable just search for icy
05:33 - info now after that we just need to add
05:35 - one more line which is android and show
05:39 - as action and here for now we are using
05:43 - never for now okay but I will show you
05:46 - how you can use other options here once
05:49 - we run our app and instead of this
05:52 - Android we just need to write app yeah
05:54 - so this is our menu resource file and we
05:58 - have one menu inside our menu and to see
06:02 - this menu what we need to do is we need
06:05 - to go to our main activity dot Java file
06:08 - and we need to overwrite this on create
06:12 - option menu so just right on create
06:15 - option menu and in here inside this on
06:20 - create option menu we just need to
06:22 - create an object of menu inflator so
06:25 - just right menu inflator
06:27 - and the name of your object for example
06:30 - menu inflator is equal to get menu
06:34 - inflator okay and after this you just
06:38 - take this menu inflator object from here
06:41 - and call an inflate method on it so
06:45 - inflate and what we want to inflate on
06:48 - it we want to inflate our main resource
06:52 - menu file so just call our dot menu dot
06:56 - main activity menu this is the file
06:59 - which we have created this one right and
07:02 - then as second argument just give this
07:06 - menu object here which we are passing as
07:10 - an argument okay so now let's run our
07:14 - program and let's see if we are able to
07:17 - see our icon or not so run it and our
07:20 - app is running now and you can see this
07:24 - overflow menu but you don't see the icon
07:27 - right and that's because we have added
07:31 - so let's go to our
07:33 - in activity menu XML file here and if
07:37 - you remember in your show as action
07:40 - method we have added this never keyword
07:44 - here okay so this stops your icon to
07:48 - show okay and it will show only your
07:53 - item but without your icon okay it will
07:56 - show only your overflow menu so if you
07:59 - change it to always like this and once
08:02 - again run your program now when you see
08:05 - here on the action bar you can see your
08:08 - info icon here now let's add one more
08:11 - item to our menu so I'm going to just
08:16 - copy this item tag here and I'm going to
08:20 - paste it just below this item and I just
08:25 - need to change the ID here so this time
08:28 - I'm going to add setting icon so I'm
08:32 - going to name it as setting ID okay and
08:35 - in the text I'm going to add settings
08:38 - and in here instead of this info icon I
08:43 - just want to add my settings icon so
08:46 - just give slash and then call IC
08:50 - settings so this is my settings icon
08:52 - which I have download now when I run the
08:55 - program
08:56 - I can see here my both icons one is
09:00 - setting icon and other is info icon here
09:04 - now for example I want to add some
09:08 - action to my icons here okay so when I
09:11 - click this I want to do some action and
09:14 - when I click this I want to do some
09:16 - other actions how can I add some action
09:20 - listener to these icons so for that you
09:23 - just need to go to your
09:24 - mainactivity.java file and in here just
09:29 - below your oncreate option menu method
09:32 - what you need to do is you need to call
09:36 - this method called
09:37 - on option item selected ok so just call
09:41 - this method and in here we can add some
09:45 - action
09:46 - listener to these icons so for example
09:50 - I'm going to add a switch statement here
09:53 - because I want to listen from multiple
09:56 - icons so I will add the switch statement
09:59 - and in here as a condition what I'm
10:03 - going to do is I'm going to pass this
10:05 - item dot get item ID okay so whatever
10:09 - item is selected I'm going to get the ID
10:12 - of the item and in the cases I'm going
10:15 - to evaluate that ID okay so in the first
10:19 - case I'm going to check our dot ID dot
10:23 - my first ID was this info right so I
10:29 - will just search for my info ID which is
10:32 - this one and if this ID is selected then
10:37 - I want to just print that this ID is
10:39 - selected so toast dot make text dot get
10:43 - application context and then the text
10:46 - for example info icon is selected and
10:49 - then toast dot length shot and then show
10:54 - in the same way I'm going to do the same
10:57 - for my second icon which is my settings
11:00 - icon so instead of this info ID I'll
11:04 - just replace it by setting ID settings
11:08 - ID and instead of this message I'm just
11:12 - going to give some other message for
11:14 - example setting icon is selected
11:17 - okay and as the default case what I'm
11:20 - going to do is I'm going to return this
11:22 - code which was already present okay so
11:26 - this is my code for listening to the
11:30 - item selection so now I'm going to run
11:32 - this program once again so now my app is
11:35 - running and when I click the Settings
11:37 - icon
11:38 - I can see setting icon is selected and
11:41 - when I click this info icon I can see
11:44 - info icon is selected okay now if you
11:49 - don't want to see these two icons
11:52 - separately and you just want to see this
11:55 - overflow menu then what you need to do
11:59 - you just need to go here in the main
12:01 - activity menu dot XML file instead of
12:05 - this always you just need never here
12:07 - okay never and never okay and when once
12:12 - again when you run this program you will
12:14 - see here instead of your icons you will
12:16 - see this overflow icon and then you can
12:21 - select your menu items okay so when you
12:25 - select info info is printed
12:27 - when you select settings settings is
12:29 - printed okay so it depends on you which
12:32 - menu item you want to show you want to
12:35 - show full icons or you want to show this
12:37 - overflow menu icon so that's it for this
12:41 - video please rate comment subscribe and
12:43 - bye for now
