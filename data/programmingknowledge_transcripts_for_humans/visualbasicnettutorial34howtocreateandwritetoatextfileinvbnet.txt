00:00 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:02 - how to create a text file using your
00:04 - Visual Basic Windows Form application
00:06 - and how to insert some text in that text
00:10 - file using your application so let's get
00:13 - started I will take a button and I will
00:16 - change the text of this button
00:20 - as
00:23 - create text file
00:26 - okay and let me change the font size so
00:30 - we can see the textt of the
00:33 - button and let's say 18 okay now I will
00:38 - just double click this button and in
00:40 - here I will declare a variable so I will
00:44 - write dim
00:46 - file
00:55 - as
00:58 - system Dot
01:00 - IO
01:02 - dot
01:06 - streamwriter okay now I will use this
01:09 - file variable and I will create a file
01:13 - so I will write
01:15 - my DOT
01:17 - computer dot file system do open file
01:22 - writer and in the bracket I will pass
01:26 - the path of this file wherever I want to
01:28 - create this
01:30 - um files and the name of the file for
01:33 - example I want to create this file
01:35 - inside
01:37 - my binary folder where my executable
01:41 - file of this project is there or you can
01:43 - provide any path which you want to give
01:47 - just wherever you want to give uh the
01:51 - path just copy the path of the library
01:54 - and just paste it there here but just
01:58 - remember just you need to replace these
02:02 - back slashes to forward slash like this
02:06 - okay so just replace all the back slash
02:09 - to the forward
02:12 - slash uh or what you can do is you can
02:18 - just add one more backs slash to every
02:22 - back slash here so there are two option
02:24 - you can do for giving the path so for
02:28 - example I just want to make my text file
02:32 - in the default location wherever my
02:36 - binary file is there so I will
02:39 - write test
02:42 - dot txt file and the second argument I
02:47 - will write
02:48 - as
02:50 - true okay so this will create my text
02:55 - file now I want to write some lines to
02:59 - my files so what I will do
03:02 - is I will write
03:04 - file dot write
03:08 - line and inside this uh bracket I can
03:13 - insert the text for the file so I can
03:19 - write this is
03:23 - my
03:27 - YouTube tutorial for example
03:30 - and whenever you create a file after
03:33 - writing the text in the file it's a good
03:36 - practice to close the file so just write
03:40 - file
03:42 - Dot close okay now I will run the
03:46 - program but first of all I will show you
03:48 - how to go to the default location or the
03:51 - binary directory of your file of your uh
03:56 - executable files so just right click
03:58 - your project and go to to the open
04:01 - folder in Project Explorer and in here
04:05 - you will be able to find this binary
04:07 - folder and in this uh binary folder you
04:11 - will have either debug or release folder
04:14 - so just go
04:16 - to this folder and this is your
04:20 - executable file here right now it's not
04:23 - compile so it's just running a
04:26 - blank project so in here my text file
04:30 - will be created so let me run the
04:34 - program so I will run the program at
04:37 - it's running without any error and
04:43 - just watch here it will create a text
04:46 - file when I click this button so I'll
04:49 - click this
04:50 - button and in here it has created a file
04:53 - called test do text and when I open this
04:58 - uh file
05:00 - inext editor so for example I will open
05:03 - it with
05:08 - wordpad it will open the text
05:13 - file and it has inserted in this word
05:17 - text which is this is my YouTube channel
05:20 - now how to insert multiple lines in this
05:26 - text file so I will close this file and
05:30 - what I will do is I will just copy this
05:35 - file. right line and I will just paste
05:38 - it two or three
05:41 - times and now when I run the
05:44 - program and when I click this create
05:47 - text file and when I open this text file
05:51 - once again it create multiple lines of
05:55 - code right so in this way you can create
05:59 - a f
06:00 - and write text or insert text into that
06:04 - text file with the help of your Visual
06:06 - Basic Windows Form application I hope
06:09 - you have enjoyed this video please WR
