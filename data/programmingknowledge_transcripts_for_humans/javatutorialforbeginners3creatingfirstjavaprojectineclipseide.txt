00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:05 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:08 - how we can uh download and
00:10 - install Eclipse IDE on our Windows
00:14 - operating system and we have also seen
00:17 - how we can configure Eclipse to run our
00:21 - Java
00:22 - programs now in this video we will see
00:26 - uh in detail how to create a new project
00:30 - and what is uh the ecosystem of uh this
00:34 - Eclipse IDE and we will uh see how to do
00:38 - some important settings uh in this
00:42 - Eclipse IDE so let's get started first
00:46 - of all once again I'm going to create a
00:49 - new
00:50 - project and then I will go to the file
00:54 - menu here and then select new and just
00:58 - select Java
01:00 - project and in here in the project name
01:04 - I will give the name to my project and
01:08 - uh this uh name should be for
01:11 - example
01:13 - uh
01:17 - first project for example okay and then
01:22 - everything remains same so you can see
01:25 - use an execution environment JRE uh uh
01:30 - by default Eclipse detects uh this gr uh
01:35 - and it also detects jdk8 folder for us
01:39 - so we don't need to provide any path for
01:42 - executing our program right the next
01:46 - thing is we just press next button and
01:49 - in here uh we will see that Eclipse will
01:54 - create a new project folder for us and
01:58 - it will also create a sub directory or
02:02 - sub folder for us which will contain all
02:05 - our source file okay and the default
02:10 - output folder will be first projects
02:13 - slash bin we are going to see this
02:16 - folder in a moment uh so just uh
02:20 - remember this that your default folder
02:23 - will be uh default output folder will be
02:26 - first project which is your project name
02:28 - which is provided by you /bin folder you
02:32 - can change it also but for now we will
02:35 - leave it as default okay and then we
02:39 - will click
02:42 - finish now you can see I have two
02:45 - projects in here listed so in Eclipse
02:49 - you can you know open as many project uh
02:53 - you want but you need to run uh these
02:57 - projects so so that you know
03:00 - uh you can run uh one project at a time
03:03 - right so you can select this project and
03:06 - you can uh build and run this project
03:09 - otherwise you can run this project okay
03:12 - so it depends upon you which project uh
03:15 - do you want to
03:18 - run and the other project which is open
03:21 - for now you can close this uh project by
03:26 - right clicking this project and just
03:30 - go to this option called close project
03:34 - and then this project will be closed
03:37 - that means this project will not be you
03:41 - know visible or open uh in this Eclipse
03:45 - Pro perspective right to delete it I
03:49 - mean from your perspective or package
03:52 - Explorer you just need to right click it
03:55 - once again and you just need to click
03:58 - delete this doesn't mean that it will be
04:02 - permanently deleted there is the option
04:05 - to delete it permanently which is this
04:07 - one delete project content on the disk
04:10 - uh so you can when you check this it
04:13 - will be deleted from your computer or if
04:18 - you uncheck or if you leave this
04:19 - unchecked it will be only deleted from
04:23 - this uh Eclipse project Explorer for now
04:27 - okay so I will click okay so this is
04:31 - deleted but
04:33 - this other project exist in my
04:37 - computer but it's not open in this pro
04:41 - package Explorer here right so I have
04:44 - this uh first project and this have this
04:48 - U Source uh folder right you can just WR
04:53 - click this folder which is Source folder
04:57 - and then add packages to to your folder
05:01 - so what are packages packages are used
05:05 - to you know def Define different
05:08 - workspaces or different folder you can
05:11 - say in your class so for example you are
05:16 - working on two different um uh different
05:21 - classes classes I will explain you later
05:24 - but uh for example uh you want to uh
05:28 - make a program for two different uh
05:32 - cases in one uh project then you can
05:36 - create a package for both of the cases
05:40 - so for example I want to create for this
05:43 - first project I want to create a lesson
05:47 - one uh case for example so I will just
05:51 - write lesson one okay and then I can
05:57 - just finish this
06:02 - and as soon as I finish this this will
06:06 - create a new folder inside my source
06:08 - folder so let's see uh how does my
06:11 - folder structure looks like so I will
06:14 - open my C folder and remember where uh
06:18 - we have you know saved our project so at
06:22 - the starting of this Eclipse ID we have
06:25 - seen that we have saved our project in
06:29 - the workspace folder in your user and
06:33 - whatever your computer name is so here
06:35 - is the workspace folder and in here
06:38 - there is my project which is first
06:40 - project and in here I have the source
06:43 - folder which is this folder and inside
06:46 - this folder now I have lesson one folder
06:49 - which is this package folder so whenever
06:52 - you create a folder uh create a package
06:55 - it will create a folder inside your
06:58 - Source folder and in here we have
07:01 - nothing for now but we will create uh
07:05 - some code for this okay so I will
07:07 - minimize this and now inside our package
07:11 - we are going to add a new
07:14 - class and this class we will name it
07:19 - as
07:21 - uh my class for
07:25 - example and just uh see how I have
07:30 - written the spelling of this my Class M
07:34 - in my is capital and C in class is
07:39 - capital right so it's camel case U
07:45 - notation so just remember this and in
07:48 - here which methods tub would you like to
07:51 - create you just need to check public
07:54 - static void Main and I will explain you
07:57 - in a moment what is uh the meaning of
08:00 - this but just uh check this option this
08:03 - is important for now okay and then press
08:07 - finish and then it created this uh class
08:12 - for us class name is my class so every
08:16 - Java project or every Java uh program
08:20 - you make have at least one class and
08:25 - inside this class you have at least one
08:28 - method which is is called main okay
08:32 - so let's uh I think this uh is not
08:37 - totally visible for now so to change the
08:41 - font size of this text editor what we
08:44 - can do is we will just go to the windows
08:47 - folder and go to the
08:50 - preferences and in here in the
08:52 - preferences there is a search box here
08:55 - we will search for
08:57 - fonts and in from fonts you can see in
09:02 - appearances there is a category called
09:04 - color and fonts so just click this and
09:07 - in here you will be able to find
09:09 - different categories for example Basics
09:12 - CVS debug git and there is a folder or
09:17 - there is a category called Java you need
09:19 - to go inside this category and then
09:22 - inside uh this Java category there is a
09:26 - category called Java editor text font
09:30 - just select this and click add it and in
09:33 - here you can change the font size or
09:36 - font Styles or whatever fonts you like
09:39 - so for example I want to make it bold
09:41 - and for example I want to make it 24 for
09:45 - now okay and whenever I click apply my
09:51 - font changes okay in a similar way I can
09:55 - change the font of my console console is
09:59 - this uh space where your output will be
10:04 - shown so hello world I want to change
10:06 - the font size of this uh font of uh the
10:10 - output of the console I can go to uh the
10:14 - category called debug and in here
10:17 - console font in console font you can
10:20 - edit it and make it bold or whatever you
10:24 - size you want to give click okay apply
10:28 - and it becomes bold and uh the size you
10:33 - give now I was talking uh that every
10:38 - Java program has at least one class
10:40 - whatever class uh you declare and at
10:44 - least one method which is called main a
10:50 - method is nothing but a small piece of
10:53 - code which performs some action so this
10:58 - method and this public static void I
11:01 - will I'm going to explain in detail what
11:04 - are these things but just uh for now
11:08 - just to understand that every program
11:12 - will have this main method and whatever
11:17 - you write inside this uh curly braces
11:20 - after this main method will be
11:24 - executed okay so for
11:27 - example uh first of all before writing
11:30 - any code I should uh teach you about
11:35 - comments so comments are important for
11:39 - example this is a comment and comments
11:42 - are important to document your program
11:46 - so for example I want to Define what is
11:50 - the purpose of this uh class or what
11:52 - this program is doing I can provide
11:56 - comment easily so to make a comment you
11:59 - just give forward slash and then this
12:03 - srix symbol and then press enter and
12:07 - when I press enter eclipse is a
12:09 - intelligent is an intelligent ID so it
12:13 - knows that I want to give an command so
12:16 - you can see it has automatically created
12:20 - this kind of command for us and whatever
12:23 - you write here for example this is
12:27 - my
12:29 - first
12:32 - uh program or something this uh you can
12:36 - do it inside these comments so these
12:38 - comments will not be executed by your
12:43 - program but this is uh only the
12:46 - information you're documenting for your
12:49 - program okay so this is not executed
12:53 - while you compile your program so this
12:56 - is one way of writing comments the other
12:59 - way of writing comment is writing two
13:02 - slashes like this okay so this also
13:07 - after whatever you write here same
13:10 - comment I can write
13:11 - here and then uh you know I can write my
13:16 - comment after these two double slashes
13:18 - and this also will not be executed right
13:23 - so whenever you create a project it has
13:28 - a class and this main method and you can
13:33 - see there is a perspective here called
13:36 - outline and you can see your package
13:40 - is uh listed here your class is listed
13:43 - here your main method is listed here so
13:47 - whenever your program becomes lengthy
13:50 - this will help you to you
13:53 - know quickly access your methods and
13:56 - classes and packages uh wherever they
14:00 - are so for example I click here main I
14:03 - my cursor go goes to main whenever I
14:07 - click my class see here what happens I
14:10 - click my class and my cursor goes to my
14:13 - class right I click lesson one my cursor
14:17 - goes to lesson one right so
14:20 - this perspective help us to access our
14:24 - method or classes uh you know quickly
14:29 - now whatever you write inside your main
14:32 - class will be executed and uh this
14:36 - program will be executed and uh give you
14:40 - some output
14:42 - so Java has already have some inbuilt
14:48 - classes to help you program for example
14:52 - most important class in Java is called
14:57 - system with capital S so just write
15:02 - system with capital S and when you give
15:05 - dot Java because eclipse is an
15:09 - intelligent IDE it'll give you this
15:12 - popup menu and it will show you what are
15:15 - the method available inside this uh
15:19 - system
15:20 - class and this system class
15:24 - has so many method you can see and we
15:28 - are going to you know use a method
15:31 - called
15:33 - out here dot
15:38 - print print Line Print
15:44 - Ln okay and inside this print Len so you
15:50 - can see you can just click this method
15:53 - of your choice and you can double click
15:56 - and in here you can uh write your first
16:02 - uh comment for example you want to
16:05 - print hello or
16:09 - hello
16:11 - YouTube you can do it like this and once
16:14 - you write this this uh code will help
16:19 - you to print hello world whenever you
16:22 - run your program so for example I want
16:25 - to run my program I will right click my
16:28 - my project and I will run as Java
16:32 - application or I can directly click this
16:36 - option run my class. Java okay so I will
16:41 - just click this green button here and it
16:44 - will open the save and launch so
16:47 - whenever you write some code it's better
16:51 - idea to save your program and if you
16:53 - don't save it Eclipse will prompt you to
16:56 - save your program and then it will run
16:58 - your program so I will save this I will
17:01 - click okay and this prints hello YouTube
17:05 - on my console right so this system is a
17:10 - class and whenever you hover over any uh
17:15 - inbuilt uh method or class in your
17:20 - Eclipse editor it will give you this
17:23 - help popup window here so you can see
17:28 - what uh this code is used for for
17:32 - example this system you can see uh some
17:36 - uh uh you know description is here the
17:39 - system class contains several useful
17:42 - class field and Method it cannot be
17:45 - instantiated so whenever you are
17:48 - confused about some code and you want
17:50 - some description of this function or
17:53 - method you can just hover over this
17:56 - class or method
17:58 - for example we want to uh have the
18:01 - description of this
18:03 - out and what this does is the standard
18:06 - output Stream So it prints it helps you
18:09 - to print uh some uh data
18:13 - right so in this way you can hover over
18:16 - the codes and see the description right
18:19 - you can also press
18:21 - control and click the method so press
18:27 - control and then hover over any method
18:30 - you want to uh you know uh uh have the
18:35 - description of and then click it and
18:38 - when you click this you will go to the
18:41 - class uh
18:44 - which has this definition of this system
18:48 - so this system. class is a inbuilt
18:52 - class so don't be confused by all these
18:55 - big uh things for now just understand
18:58 - whenever you write
19:00 - system.out.print line and inside the
19:02 - bracket whatever comments you comment
19:04 - you write will be printed on this
19:07 - console right but I just wanted to show
19:11 - you how you can you know get some help
19:14 - or description or whatever from the code
19:18 - itself that's why we have installed this
19:21 - intelligent Eclipse
19:24 - IDE so I hope you have understood the
19:28 - basic uh uh you know things about this
19:31 - ecosystem of eclipse and creating the
19:34 - project and I hope you have enjoyed the
19:36 - video please rate comment and subscribe
19:38 - and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can uh download and install Eclipse IDE on our Windows operating system and we have also seen how we can configure Eclipse to run our Java programs now in this video we will see uh in detail how to create a new project and what is uh the ecosystem of uh this Eclipse IDE and we will uh see how to do some important settings uh in this Eclipse IDE so let's get started first of all once again I'm going to create a new project and then I will go to the file menu here and then select new and just select Java project and in here in the project name I will give the name to my project and uh this uh name should be for example uh first project for example okay and then everything remains same so you can see use an execution environment JRE uh uh by default Eclipse detects uh this gr uh and it also detects jdk8 folder for us so we don't need to provide any path for executing our program right the next thing is we just press next button and in here uh we will see that Eclipse will create a new project folder for us and it will also create a sub directory or sub folder for us which will contain all our source file okay and the default output folder will be first projects slash bin we are going to see this folder in a moment uh so just uh remember this that your default folder will be uh default output folder will be first project which is your project name which is provided by you /bin folder you can change it also but for now we will leave it as default okay and then we will click finish now you can see I have two projects in here listed so in Eclipse you can you know open as many project uh you want but you need to run uh these projects so so that you know uh you can run uh one project at a time right so you can select this project and you can uh build and run this project otherwise you can run this project okay so it depends upon you which project uh do you want to run and the other project which is open for now you can close this uh project by right clicking this project and just go to this option called close project and then this project will be closed that means this project will not be you know visible or open uh in this Eclipse Pro perspective right to delete it I mean from your perspective or package Explorer you just need to right click it once again and you just need to click delete this doesn't mean that it will be permanently deleted there is the option to delete it permanently which is this one delete project content on the disk uh so you can when you check this it will be deleted from your computer or if you uncheck or if you leave this unchecked it will be only deleted from this uh Eclipse project Explorer for now okay so I will click okay so this is deleted but this other project exist in my computer but it's not open in this pro package Explorer here right so I have this uh first project and this have this U Source uh folder right you can just WR click this folder which is Source folder and then add packages to to your folder so what are packages packages are used to you know def Define different workspaces or different folder you can say in your class so for example you are working on two different um uh different classes classes I will explain you later but uh for example uh you want to uh make a program for two different uh cases in one uh project then you can create a package for both of the cases so for example I want to create for this first project I want to create a lesson one uh case for example so I will just write lesson one okay and then I can just finish this and as soon as I finish this this will create a new folder inside my source folder so let's see uh how does my folder structure looks like so I will open my C folder and remember where uh we have you know saved our project so at the starting of this Eclipse ID we have seen that we have saved our project in the workspace folder in your user and whatever your computer name is so here is the workspace folder and in here there is my project which is first project and in here I have the source folder which is this folder and inside this folder now I have lesson one folder which is this package folder so whenever you create a folder uh create a package it will create a folder inside your Source folder and in here we have nothing for now but we will create uh some code for this okay so I will minimize this and now inside our package we are going to add a new class and this class we will name it as uh my class for example and just uh see how I have written the spelling of this my Class M in my is capital and C in class is capital right so it's camel case U notation so just remember this and in here which methods tub would you like to create you just need to check public static void Main and I will explain you in a moment what is uh the meaning of this but just uh check this option this is important for now okay and then press finish and then it created this uh class for us class name is my class so every Java project or every Java uh program you make have at least one class and inside this class you have at least one method which is is called main okay so let's uh I think this uh is not totally visible for now so to change the font size of this text editor what we can do is we will just go to the windows folder and go to the preferences and in here in the preferences there is a search box here we will search for fonts and in from fonts you can see in appearances there is a category called color and fonts so just click this and in here you will be able to find different categories for example Basics CVS debug git and there is a folder or there is a category called Java you need to go inside this category and then inside uh this Java category there is a category called Java editor text font just select this and click add it and in here you can change the font size or font Styles or whatever fonts you like so for example I want to make it bold and for example I want to make it 24 for now okay and whenever I click apply my font changes okay in a similar way I can change the font of my console console is this uh space where your output will be shown so hello world I want to change the font size of this uh font of uh the output of the console I can go to uh the category called debug and in here console font in console font you can edit it and make it bold or whatever you size you want to give click okay apply and it becomes bold and uh the size you give now I was talking uh that every Java program has at least one class whatever class uh you declare and at least one method which is called main a method is nothing but a small piece of code which performs some action so this method and this public static void I will I'm going to explain in detail what are these things but just uh for now just to understand that every program will have this main method and whatever you write inside this uh curly braces after this main method will be executed okay so for example uh first of all before writing any code I should uh teach you about comments so comments are important for example this is a comment and comments are important to document your program so for example I want to Define what is the purpose of this uh class or what this program is doing I can provide comment easily so to make a comment you just give forward slash and then this srix symbol and then press enter and when I press enter eclipse is a intelligent is an intelligent ID so it knows that I want to give an command so you can see it has automatically created this kind of command for us and whatever you write here for example this is my first uh program or something this uh you can do it inside these comments so these comments will not be executed by your program but this is uh only the information you're documenting for your program okay so this is not executed while you compile your program so this is one way of writing comments the other way of writing comment is writing two slashes like this okay so this also after whatever you write here same comment I can write here and then uh you know I can write my comment after these two double slashes and this also will not be executed right so whenever you create a project it has a class and this main method and you can see there is a perspective here called outline and you can see your package is uh listed here your class is listed here your main method is listed here so whenever your program becomes lengthy this will help you to you know quickly access your methods and classes and packages uh wherever they are so for example I click here main I my cursor go goes to main whenever I click my class see here what happens I click my class and my cursor goes to my class right I click lesson one my cursor goes to lesson one right so this perspective help us to access our method or classes uh you know quickly now whatever you write inside your main class will be executed and uh this program will be executed and uh give you some output so Java has already have some inbuilt classes to help you program for example most important class in Java is called system with capital S so just write system with capital S and when you give dot Java because eclipse is an intelligent IDE it'll give you this popup menu and it will show you what are the method available inside this uh system class and this system class has so many method you can see and we are going to you know use a method called out here dot print print Line Print Ln okay and inside this print Len so you can see you can just click this method of your choice and you can double click and in here you can uh write your first uh comment for example you want to print hello or hello YouTube you can do it like this and once you write this this uh code will help you to print hello world whenever you run your program so for example I want to run my program I will right click my my project and I will run as Java application or I can directly click this option run my class. Java okay so I will just click this green button here and it will open the save and launch so whenever you write some code it's better idea to save your program and if you don't save it Eclipse will prompt you to save your program and then it will run your program so I will save this I will click okay and this prints hello YouTube on my console right so this system is a class and whenever you hover over any uh inbuilt uh method or class in your Eclipse editor it will give you this help popup window here so you can see what uh this code is used for for example this system you can see uh some uh uh you know description is here the system class contains several useful class field and Method it cannot be instantiated so whenever you are confused about some code and you want some description of this function or method you can just hover over this class or method for example we want to uh have the description of this out and what this does is the standard output Stream So it prints it helps you to print uh some uh data right so in this way you can hover over the codes and see the description right you can also press control and click the method so press control and then hover over any method you want to uh you know uh uh have the description of and then click it and when you click this you will go to the class uh which has this definition of this system so this system. class is a inbuilt class so don't be confused by all these big uh things for now just understand whenever you write system.out.print line and inside the bracket whatever comments you comment you write will be printed on this console right but I just wanted to show you how you can you know get some help or description or whatever from the code itself that's why we have installed this intelligent Eclipse IDE so I hope you have understood the basic uh uh you know things about this ecosystem of eclipse and creating the project and I hope you have enjoyed the video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
