00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can set up your visual
00:05 - studio code editor for the Java
00:08 - development so obviously the first step
00:11 - is to download the visual studio code
00:14 - and if you don't know how to download
00:15 - Visual Studio code you can just search
00:18 - for Visual Studio code on your favorite
00:22 - search engine and then the first link
00:25 - which will appear here will be from code
00:27 - dot visual studio dot
00:29 - on this link and directly you will see
00:32 - this green button here or on the top so
00:37 - currently I'm just making this video for
00:40 - Windows or but this same method will
00:44 - work for Mac OS or any other Linux
00:47 - operating system so you can see this
00:50 - option just click on this button and
00:52 - then an executable file will be
00:55 - downloaded which you can execute and
00:57 - it's very simple to install Visual
01:00 - Studio code so I'm not going to show you
01:03 - how you can install Visual Studio code
01:06 - now after installing Visual Studio code
01:08 - the most important thing you need to
01:12 - develop your Java code or projects with
01:16 - Visual Studio code is the Java JDK so if
01:21 - you don't have Java JDK installed you
01:24 - can search for Java JDK and then you
01:27 - will see few links here so you can see
01:30 - in my case I can see Java SE development
01:33 - kit 8 which was the older JDK version
01:37 - and when I scroll down I can see Java SE
01:42 - development kit 12 which is the latest
01:44 - version at the time of making this video
01:47 - make sure that this link is from Oracle
01:52 - comm right so I'm going to just click on
01:55 - this link which says Java S II a
01:59 - development kit 12 or whatever version
02:01 - is the latest version when you are
02:05 - installing the Java development kit okay
02:08 - so you will see this kind of page and
02:10 - then just accept
02:13 - the license terms and conditions and
02:15 - then choose the executable file or the
02:19 - binary file for your operating system
02:21 - so as this video is made on Windows
02:24 - operating system so I can just click on
02:27 - this option which says Windows
02:29 - - x64 underscore bin dot exe extension
02:34 - right so just download this executable
02:38 - file and then install it and the steps
02:41 - are really simple so once again you just
02:43 - need to click on this executable file
02:45 - and then just follow the procedure and
02:48 - click on some next buttons and you will
02:51 - be good to go
02:52 - the most important thing is to set the
02:55 - Java home environment variable so I have
03:00 - already created a video on how to
03:03 - install Java development kit and how you
03:07 - can set your environment variable that
03:11 - is Java home environment variable so I
03:13 - will put the link of that video in the
03:16 - description of this video so you can
03:19 - just see that video and install java jdk
03:23 - and set java home environment variable
03:27 - so once you have installed Visual Studio
03:30 - code and you have installed Java
03:33 - development kit and set the environment
03:36 - variable the last thing which remains is
03:39 - you just need to search for Visual
03:42 - Studio code Java and you will see this
03:45 - link all the links which I'm showing you
03:47 - I'm going to put all the links in the
03:49 - description of this video so you can
03:51 - directly click those link and just go to
03:54 - those websites so you just need to click
03:58 - on this link which says Java in Visual
04:01 - Studio code or code dot Visual Studio
04:03 - com forward slash dogs forward slash
04:06 - languages forward slash Java so I'm
04:08 - going to just click on this link and
04:10 - here you can read this document and see
04:15 - the procedure on how Java is supported
04:20 - in Visual Studio code the most important
04:22 - thing I want to show you here is
04:25 - this option which is download Visual
04:29 - Studio code Java pack installer so in
04:34 - order to fast-track your Java
04:36 - development in Visual Studio code
04:39 - Microsoft has already created this Java
04:42 - pack installer for Visual Studio code so
04:46 - you can directly download this and
04:48 - install this and it will be
04:51 - automatically added to your Visual
04:54 - Studio code so it will make the
04:57 - development of Java projects on your
04:59 - Visual Studio code easier so I'm going
05:02 - to just click on this button which says
05:05 - download Visual Studio code Java pack
05:08 - installer and then save this file now
05:11 - once this executable file is downloaded
05:14 - for Visual Studio code Java pack
05:17 - installer I'm going to click on this
05:19 - link and then I'm going to minimize the
05:22 - browser and you can see this window has
05:26 - been started for Visual Studio code Java
05:29 - pack installer first is to accept
05:31 - license terms and conditions so I'm
05:33 - going to click Next the second step is
05:35 - to configure the components for Java
05:38 - development kit and Visual Studio code
05:40 - and as you can see if Java development
05:43 - kit and Visual Studio code is installed
05:46 - on your operating system then you will
05:50 - be able to see this kind of message in
05:54 - front of Java development kit you can
05:56 - see it's installed on my system and
05:59 - Visual Studio code is installed on my
06:01 - system that's why I told you to install
06:04 - these two things first before installing
06:07 - this Java pack installer for Visual
06:10 - Studio code so just click on install and
06:13 - then wait for some time so you don't
06:16 - need to do anything this installer will
06:19 - find everything and set everything
06:22 - automatically for you for Visual Studio
06:24 - code and after a few seconds you will
06:27 - see this message which says completing
06:29 - the setup wizard and launch Visual
06:32 - Studio code so I'm going to just click
06:34 - on the finish button which is going to
06:36 - launch the visual studio code
06:39 - with this package installed and now
06:42 - Visual Studio code is opened right so
06:46 - once the Visual Studio code is opened
06:49 - you can develop your Java project in
06:52 - your Visual Studio code so let's develop
06:55 - a simple java code in Visual Studio code
07:01 - editor so let's say I want to create
07:04 - this project in this path on my PC under
07:07 - this Java with Visual Studio code
07:10 - directory or folder so you can open this
07:16 - folder in Visual Studio code by just
07:19 - clicking on file and then just click on
07:22 - open folder and then just copy this path
07:26 - and paste it here
07:29 - and then just click on select folder
07:31 - which is going to open this folder in
07:34 - Visual Studio code so you can see this
07:37 - folder is open inside Visual Studio code
07:40 - which is Java with vs code or what you
07:45 - can do is you can just copy this path
07:47 - once again
07:48 - and right-click on your windows icon on
07:52 - the left hand side and then open the
07:55 - command prompt from here so I'm going to
07:57 - just click on command prompt which is
07:58 - going to open the command prompt and
08:01 - once the command prompt is open you can
08:03 - just write CD and then paste this path
08:07 - which you have copied and then press
08:09 - ENTER and from here also you can just
08:12 - write a code and then space dot okay
08:17 - code space dot and what this is going to
08:21 - do is this is going to open your Visual
08:23 - Studio code inside this directory so
08:28 - this directory you need to CD into this
08:30 - directory using the command prompt and
08:32 - then they give this command then also
08:35 - it's going to open this folder inside
08:38 - Visual Studio code so let's see this how
08:41 - it works so I'm going to close the
08:44 - Visual Studio code and then give this
08:46 - command and you will see this is also
08:49 - going to open this folder inside the
08:52 - Visual Studio code editor so once this
08:56 - folder is open in your Visual Studio
09:00 - code editor you can create a dot Java
09:03 - file by just clicking on this icon with
09:05 - his new file and let's create a new file
09:08 - let's say hello dot Java and then press
09:12 - Enter which is going to create this
09:15 - hello dot Java and also give you this
09:18 - tab which is going to show you some of
09:22 - the documentation about Java development
09:24 - in the Visual Studio code so I'm going
09:26 - to just close this and this welcome
09:29 - window for now and just leave the hello
09:32 - dot Java file opened now what you can do
09:35 - here is you can create a class let's say
09:37 - so let's create a class so I'm going to
09:39 - just say class and you can see this
09:43 - intellisense and you will see two
09:46 - options so just click on the second
09:47 - option here which is automatically going
09:50 - to create a sample class for you which
09:53 - is public class hello and here when you
09:57 - want to create a mean method year so you
10:00 - can just type mean and then click on
10:04 - this
10:05 - intellisense which comes here or press
10:08 - enter then it's going to create your
10:11 - public static void main method and
10:13 - inside this main method you can for
10:18 - example print anything so I'm going to
10:20 - just write system dot out dot print line
10:26 - and here let's print something so I'm
10:29 - going to just say print test and when
10:33 - you want to run this program you can see
10:35 - this option directly visible here so you
10:38 - can just click on this Run button or
10:43 - link here which is going to run in your
10:45 - code first it's going to compile your
10:48 - code and if it compiles successfully
10:50 - then it's going to run your code let's
10:54 - say we just intentionally put some error
10:57 - here and then try to compile directly
11:01 - you can see this red squiggly line which
11:03 - is going to warn you that
11:05 - is some problem in your code and let's
11:08 - say I'm going to run this code again and
11:10 - it's going to build your code and it's
11:13 - going to show the error compilation
11:15 - error because we missed the semicolon
11:17 - after this line of code so you can see
11:21 - these warnings or compilation problems
11:24 - if you have any in your terminal here in
11:29 - the debug console you can also debug
11:32 - your code by this option so let's say
11:35 - I'm going to create a string variable
11:37 - I'm going to just say string here and
11:41 - then declare at this variable let's say
11:44 - string x equals test so test and then
11:51 - I'm going to pass this X variable here
11:55 - inside the print line method and let's
11:59 - say I want to debug on the line number
12:03 - eight so you can see this red dot here
12:07 - you can move this red dot anywhere so
12:10 - I'm going to just click on this red dot
12:12 - and then once this red dot is visible I
12:16 - can just click on this debug option
12:19 - which is going to run your code in debug
12:23 - mode and on the left hand side you can
12:26 - see the variable value also so you can
12:30 - see the variable value and also all the
12:35 - debugging variables you will be able to
12:38 - see on the left-hand side and if you
12:41 - want to go further for example if you
12:45 - want to step over or step into or step
12:48 - out you can use these top options so
12:52 - let's say I want to step over so I can
12:54 - click on this button or if I want to
12:57 - just stop the debugging then I can click
13:00 - on the red button which is going to stop
13:02 - this debugging now this is how you can
13:07 - create your Java project and run and
13:10 - debug your Java project in your Visual
13:13 - Studio code editor now if you want some
13:16 - more support of Java
13:19 - side visual studio code you can always
13:21 - go to this icon which says extensions
13:24 - and search for a Java extension so just
13:28 - search for Java here and you will see
13:31 - plenty of options available related to
13:35 - Java so for example if you want to
13:38 - develop a maven project for Java then
13:41 - this extension might be useful and you
13:45 - can see on my visual studio code it's
13:49 - already installed
13:50 - I haven't installed it specifically but
13:53 - its installed automatically because I
13:56 - have already installed this option which
14:00 - is download Visual Studio Java pack
14:03 - installer so some of the extensions are
14:06 - automatically installed when you install
14:09 - this Java package extension for Visual
14:13 - Studio code so you can just see these
14:17 - extension for example Java debugger if
14:20 - you want there are 300,000 download for
14:26 - this extension so you can try this
14:28 - extension or Tomcat for Java extensions
14:32 - so you can see plenty of extensions
14:34 - available for you for your help so you
14:38 - can try these extensions also but basic
14:42 - applications related to Java you can
14:44 - directly start creating with this
14:49 - extension which we have downloaded which
14:52 - is the Java pack extension without any
14:55 - problem it's going to work so this is
14:59 - how you can develop your Java project
15:03 - inside so this is how you can develop
15:06 - your Java projects inside Visual Studio
15:09 - code I hope you've enjoyed this video
15:12 - and I will see you in
15:21 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up your visual studio code editor for the Java development so obviously the first step is to download the visual studio code and if you don't know how to download Visual Studio code you can just search for Visual Studio code on your favorite search engine and then the first link which will appear here will be from code dot visual studio dot on this link and directly you will see this green button here or on the top so currently I'm just making this video for Windows or but this same method will work for Mac OS or any other Linux operating system so you can see this option just click on this button and then an executable file will be downloaded which you can execute and it's very simple to install Visual Studio code so I'm not going to show you how you can install Visual Studio code now after installing Visual Studio code the most important thing you need to develop your Java code or projects with Visual Studio code is the Java JDK so if you don't have Java JDK installed you can search for Java JDK and then you will see few links here so you can see in my case I can see Java SE development kit 8 which was the older JDK version and when I scroll down I can see Java SE development kit 12 which is the latest version at the time of making this video make sure that this link is from Oracle comm right so I'm going to just click on this link which says Java S II a development kit 12 or whatever version is the latest version when you are installing the Java development kit okay so you will see this kind of page and then just accept the license terms and conditions and then choose the executable file or the binary file for your operating system so as this video is made on Windows operating system so I can just click on this option which says Windows x64 underscore bin dot exe extension right so just download this executable file and then install it and the steps are really simple so once again you just need to click on this executable file and then just follow the procedure and click on some next buttons and you will be good to go the most important thing is to set the Java home environment variable so I have already created a video on how to install Java development kit and how you can set your environment variable that is Java home environment variable so I will put the link of that video in the description of this video so you can just see that video and install java jdk and set java home environment variable so once you have installed Visual Studio code and you have installed Java development kit and set the environment variable the last thing which remains is you just need to search for Visual Studio code Java and you will see this link all the links which I'm showing you I'm going to put all the links in the description of this video so you can directly click those link and just go to those websites so you just need to click on this link which says Java in Visual Studio code or code dot Visual Studio com forward slash dogs forward slash languages forward slash Java so I'm going to just click on this link and here you can read this document and see the procedure on how Java is supported in Visual Studio code the most important thing I want to show you here is this option which is download Visual Studio code Java pack installer so in order to fasttrack your Java development in Visual Studio code Microsoft has already created this Java pack installer for Visual Studio code so you can directly download this and install this and it will be

is to configure the components for Java development kit and Visual Studio code and as you can see if Java development kit and Visual Studio code is installed on your operating system then you will be able to see this kind of message in front of Java development kit you can see it's installed on my system and Visual Studio code is installed on my system that's why I told you to install these two things first before installing this Java pack installer for Visual Studio code so just click on install and then wait for some time so you don't need to do anything this installer will find everything and set everything automatically for you for Visual Studio code and after a few seconds you will see this message which says completing the setup wizard and launch Visual Studio code so I'm going to just click on the finish button which is going to launch the visual studio code with this package installed and now Visual Studio code is opened right so once the Visual Studio code is opened you can develop your Java project in your Visual Studio code so let's develop a simple java code in Visual Studio code editor so let's say I want to create this project in this path on my PC under this Java with Visual Studio code directory or folder so you can open this folder in Visual Studio code by just clicking on file and then just click on open folder and then just copy this path and paste it here and then just click on select folder which is going to open this folder in Visual Studio code so you can see this folder is open inside Visual Studio code which is Java with vs code or what you can do is you can just copy this path once again and rightclick on your windows icon on the left hand side and then open the command prompt from here so I'm going to just click on command prompt which is going to open the command prompt and once the command prompt is open you can just write CD and then paste this path which you have copied and then press ENTER and from here also you can just write a code and then space dot okay code space dot and what this is going to do is this is going to open your Visual Studio code inside this directory so this directory you need to CD into this directory using the command prompt and then they give this command then also it's going to open this folder inside Visual Studio code so let's see this how it works so I'm going to close the Visual Studio code and then give this command and you will see this is also going to open this folder inside the Visual Studio code editor so once this folder is open in your Visual Studio code editor you can create a dot Java file by just clicking on this icon with his new file and let's create a new file let's say hello dot Java and then press Enter which is going to create this hello dot Java and also give you this tab which is going to show you some of the documentation about Java development in the Visual Studio code so I'm going to just close this and this welcome window for now and just leave the hello dot Java file opened now what you can do here is you can create a class let's say so let's create a class so I'm going to just say class and you can see this intellisense and you will see two options so just click on the second option here which is automatically going to create a sample class for you which is public class hello and here when you want to create a mean method year so you can just type mean and then click on this intellisense which comes here or press enter then it's going to create your public static void main method and inside this main method you can for example print

going to just say string here and then declare at this variable let's say string x equals test so test and then I'm going to pass this X variable here inside the print line method and let's say I want to debug on the line number eight so you can see this red dot here you can move this red dot anywhere so I'm going to just click on this red dot and then once this red dot is visible I can just click on this debug option which is going to run your code in debug mode and on the left hand side you can see the variable value also so you can see the variable value and also all the debugging variables you will be able to see on the lefthand side and if you want to go further for example if you want to step over or step into or step out you can use these top options so let's say I want to step over so I can click on this button or if I want to just stop the debugging then I can click on the red button which is going to stop this debugging now this is how you can create your Java project and run and debug your Java project in your Visual Studio code editor now if you want some more support of Java side visual studio code you can always go to this icon which says extensions and search for a Java extension so just search for Java here and you will see plenty of options available related to Java so for example if you want to develop a maven project for Java then this extension might be

without any problem it's going to work so this is how you can develop your Java project inside so this is how you can develop your Java projects inside Visual Studio code I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in you
