00:01 - hello guys welcome to the second video
00:02 - tutorial on PHP programming tutorial for
00:05 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:08 - show you how to install exm web server
00:13 - to test your
00:14 - PHP uh programs so exm is a web server
00:20 - so which exm is a tool by which you can
00:24 - make your computer as a server for
00:28 - testing your uh your applications so
00:32 - let's see how we can install XM so just
00:35 - open your browser and search for XA
00:39 - MPP and the first link you will find
00:41 - here is from uh
00:44 - www. Apache friends.org so you need to
00:49 - open this Apache friends.org
00:52 - and you will be able to find these links
00:56 - here for Windows Linux and uh Mac OS
01:00 - for now we want this installation for
01:02 - Windows so just click this exm for
01:06 - Windows and then you will be able
01:09 - to download this file on your computer
01:13 - so download will start in few seconds
01:16 - and download has started now you see
01:18 - here and it it will take some time for
01:21 - example 1 minute to download uh because
01:24 - it's 100 or more than 100 MB file so I
01:28 - will pause the video and once it will be
01:30 - downloaded I will continue with the
01:33 - installation
01:35 - okay so my download is complete now I
01:38 - can uh run this executable file from
01:40 - here and it'll show you this uh little
01:44 - warning you can just say
01:49 - yes and the installation will
01:55 - start so installation has
01:58 - started
02:01 - and in between you will be able to see
02:03 - These Warnings uh it will ask you some
02:06 - questions and it will in the last it
02:08 - will ask you continue with the
02:10 - installation you just want to say yes
02:13 - and once again this warning you will be
02:15 - able to see just click okay and click
02:20 - next and these are the tools you will be
02:23 - able to install whenever you are
02:25 - installing XM so the package will
02:28 - contain a part MySQL files alarm and
02:32 - Mercury mail server Tomcat server PHP
02:36 - Pearl PHP my admin and all these things
02:40 - so I generally uh leave them all checked
02:44 - because I want to uh install all all of
02:46 - them and I will click
02:48 - next and this is the default location
02:51 - where exemp will be installed in your
02:53 - system C colon XM so just remember this
02:56 - you're going to go to this folder to
02:59 - access some files so just remember this
03:01 - location and click next and click next
03:06 - and next and now the installation will
03:10 - start it will take some time to uh uh
03:13 - the installation to complete so just
03:16 - wait for I think for 5 minutes in 5
03:19 - minutes this installation will be
03:21 - completed so I will just pause the video
03:23 - and let this installation to complete
03:26 - and once this installation is complete
03:28 - we will see how to um go further
03:33 - okay so now our installation is complete
03:37 - just leave this uh checkbox checked to
03:40 - uh start the control panel for XM so I
03:44 - will leave it as checked and I will
03:46 - click finish and as soon as you uh click
03:49 - finish button uh the XM control panel
03:53 - will open
03:58 - now
04:02 - and once you see this XM control panel
04:05 - you will be able to start myql database
04:09 - server and your Apache from this control
04:13 - panel so if if it takes uh a time you
04:17 - can always go to your start button and
04:20 - search
04:22 - for XA
04:27 - mppp and you can start this xmpp from
04:31 - here also you will be able to see this
04:34 - XMP control panel you just need to click
04:38 - this option to start your control panel
04:43 - okay so our control panel has
04:46 - started and now you will be able to see
04:50 - this
04:51 - uh you can start this Apache from here
04:54 - you can start MySQL from here and file
04:58 - Zilla Mercury
05:00 - mail server and Tomcat from here so how
05:03 - you can start these all the servers and
05:08 - databases now once your control panel is
05:12 - running and if you see some error or red
05:16 - lines here and it's if it says that your
05:20 - Port 80 which is used by Apache web
05:23 - server is used by some other P how you
05:27 - can close that that P and start aage
05:32 - server on that p8 I will show you first
05:35 - because most of you may maybe you will
05:39 - have Port 0 already in use and you will
05:42 - face some problems right so it says Port
05:46 - 0 in use unable to open the process with
05:49 - P id4 okay so what you need to do is you
05:53 - can uh search for the process which uh
05:57 - is using your Port at0 by going to the
05:59 - start button and search for CMD which
06:02 - will open the command prompt just open
06:05 - the command prompt and in here type in
06:09 - net stat
06:11 - minus a o so give this command net stat
06:14 - minus AO and press enter and now you
06:18 - will be able to see all the ports which
06:22 - are in use and the first uh Port which
06:26 - is Port 80 you will be able to see the P
06:28 - ID of this port it which is uh this uh
06:33 - four so p id4 is using this port already
06:38 - so I will just kill this port
06:42 - by the
06:47 - command task kill and then give the
06:51 - slash then write p and the number of P
06:56 - ID so my P ID which is in use is four
07:01 - right so you see here P ID 4 is using
07:05 - Port so just write here task kill SLP ID
07:10 - and give the number of the uh P ID which
07:13 - it's using and press
07:16 - enter and if it says X is denied
07:21 - then then probably some important
07:25 - process is using this u p you can uh use
07:30 - uh this XM control panel also to see
07:35 - whatever ports are in use so just click
07:38 - this uh on this control panel there are
07:41 - some button and there is a button called
07:43 - net stat here and in here you will be
07:46 - able to see all the processes which are
07:49 - in use in which Port 0 also is in use
07:53 - right so just if Port 80 is uh in use
07:58 - and it's uh used by System then uh
08:02 - probably you can change the port on
08:04 - which this Apache will be able to
08:07 - listen so to change this what you need
08:11 - to do is for example I want to start my
08:14 - Apache web server on um port 8080 how
08:18 - can I do that so because my port 80 is
08:22 - already busy and it's not allowed to use
08:25 - uh this port 880 I want to change the
08:28 - port on which my Apache web server will
08:30 - listen right so once again I will go to
08:35 - my config button here in front of this
08:39 - Apache you will be able to see this U uh
08:42 - start button and this config button I
08:45 - will just click this config button and
08:47 - the first option which is Apache HTTP
08:51 - d.com in here you need to go here and in
08:56 - here search for the port listen 80 so
09:00 - you will be able to see this option here
09:02 - listen 0
09:04 - here what you need to do is you need to
09:06 - just change it to the port whatever is
09:10 - free on your uh on your computer so Port
09:13 - 80 is in use right now so I will change
09:16 - it to Port 80 80 80 80 okay and here
09:21 - also I will change it 80
09:24 - 80 so that and I will save this file
09:29 - file and save so
09:31 - that uh this port on which a par web
09:35 - server will listen will be changed to
09:38 - port 8080 okay I will close this and now
09:42 - I will try to start my Apache web server
09:45 - and hopefully it will be started and you
09:47 - will be able to see this here port 8080
09:50 - so it has started on port 8080 okay so
09:55 - if you see this uh error here then this
09:59 - is the solution for that otherwise if
10:02 - it's listening on Port 80 you don't need
10:05 - to do anything you just need to just
10:07 - click this start button and you will be
10:10 - good to go okay but if this port 80 is
10:13 - used by some other process then you can
10:15 - change the port like this okay now I
10:19 - will start my MySQL
10:21 - server and it started I'll show you this
10:26 - message you just need to give the
10:29 - private Network and public network and
10:31 - just click this allow access
10:35 - here and now both servers are running
10:40 - now to check whether it's really
10:43 - running we can go to our web browser and
10:48 - just write on your web
10:51 - browser Local Host okay and it will say
10:55 - not found because I have changed the
10:58 - port to 88
10:59 - so now you need to give Local Host
11:03 - colon
11:06 - 8080 okay and now you will be able to
11:09 - see this uh
11:11 - exemp okay now here you can choose your
11:15 - um language I will choose
11:19 - English and in here I will go to
11:22 - security to change my security options
11:26 - because right now I have provided the
11:28 - public access to my computer so I will
11:30 - change this security so go to the
11:33 - security tab here click the security Tab
11:37 - and in here you will be able to see here
11:40 - every ex uh these XM pages are
11:43 - accessible by Network for everyone and
11:46 - the status is unsecure for these right
11:49 - so to make them secure you need to click
11:52 - this button or this link HTTP SL
11:56 - localhost security just click this
12:00 - and in here you will see the password
12:04 - changing option for MySQL and HT access
12:08 - okay so you can change this password by
12:11 - giving some password to your mql for
12:14 - example I will give some password to my
12:17 - MySQL and In Here Also I will repeat my
12:20 - password and I will click change
12:23 - password or password changing and this
12:26 - will show me the result the root
12:28 - password was successfully changed that
12:30 - means my uh password has been changed
12:34 - same I will do for this XM directory
12:37 - protection which is
12:38 - hxs so I will provide the user is equal
12:43 - to root and some
12:46 - password and I will click this make safe
12:50 - exemp
12:52 - directory by this you will be able to
12:55 - see this success the exm directory is
12:58 - protected now all personal data was
13:00 - saved in the file this this this okay so
13:06 - now you all you have protected all your
13:09 - files and one once you will go to this
13:12 - language English here you will see all
13:15 - the status has been changed to success
13:18 - here uh secure here green with a green
13:22 - highlight that means your MySQL route is
13:25 - successful uh secured your XM pages are
13:29 - secured and your PHP my admin is secured
13:33 - okay now for example to test whether
13:36 - it's really running or not uh you can go
13:40 - to your folder wherever you have
13:42 - installed this xam MPP so I have
13:45 - installed this xmpp in my C directory so
13:50 - I will go to my C directory and this C
13:52 - directory I will be able to see this
13:54 - folder
13:55 - xmpp xpp sorry and and in here I the
14:01 - important folder for my use is this HD
14:05 - docs folder so go inside this HT doc
14:09 - folder HT docs and here are all pages
14:14 - you will be able to see uh from the web
14:17 - server so this is your main gateway to
14:20 - the uh you know web server so this
14:24 - index.php which you see
14:26 - here is
14:29 - when you go to the browser and this is
14:32 - the index do PHP you are seeing here
14:36 - this index PHP is the same file you can
14:39 - see here in this PHP this is favicon or
14:43 - and all HTML and uh and images so this
14:47 - is where you need to put your all files
14:51 - in order to see them in the browser so
14:54 - for example I will create a new file
14:56 - right click new
14:59 - new text
15:01 - document and I will name it this text
15:04 - test document
15:05 - as
15:07 - test and I will open this test document
15:11 - and I will write here this is
15:15 - uh test
15:19 - for for
15:22 - xam PP okay and I will save this save it
15:28 - close this and once again you go to your
15:31 - browser and in your Local Host col 88s
15:36 - just instead of this security and/
15:40 - index.php you can just check
15:43 - for test dot text file
15:47 - test.txt file right press enter and you
15:51 - will be able to see the same M message
15:53 - you have saved in your test file this is
15:57 - a test for exemp
15:59 - right so whatever you put in your uh HD
16:04 - docs file you will be able to see it on
16:08 - your
16:09 - browser so that's it for this video
16:13 - hopefully you have understood how to
16:15 - install and how to use this examp on
16:18 - your Windows operating system I hope you
16:20 - have enjoyed this video please rate

error here then this is the solution for that otherwise if it's listening on Port 80 you don't need to do anything you just need to just click this start button and you will be good to go okay but if this port 80 is used by some other process then you can change the port like this okay now I will start my MySQL server and it started I'll show you this message you just need to give the private Network and public network and just click this allow access here and now both servers are running now to check whether it's really running we can go to our web browser and just write on your web browser Local Host okay and it will say not found because I have changed the port to 88 so now you need to give Local Host colon 8080 okay and now you will be able to see this uh exemp okay now here you can choose your um language I will choose English and in here I will go to security to change my security options because right now I have provided the public access to my computer so I will change this security so go to the security tab here click the security Tab and in here you will be able to see here every ex uh these XM pages are accessible by Network for everyone and the status is unsecure for these right so to make them secure you need to click this button or this link HTTP SL localhost security just click this and in here you will see the password changing option for MySQL and HT access okay so you can change this password by giving some password to your mql for example I will give some password to my MySQL and In Here Also I will repeat my password and I will click change password or password changing and this will show me the result the root password was successfully changed that means my uh password has been changed same I will do for this XM directory protection which is hxs so I will provide the user is equal to root and some password and I will click this make safe exemp directory by this you will be able to see this success the exm directory is

now for example to test whether it's really running or not uh you can go to your folder wherever you have installed this xam MPP so I have installed this xmpp in my C directory so I will go to my C directory and this C directory I will be able to see this folder xmpp xpp sorry and and in here I the important folder for my use is this HD docs folder so go inside this HT doc folder HT docs and here are all pages you will be able to see uh from the web server so this is your main gateway to the uh you know web server so this index.php which you see here is when you go to the browser and this is the index do PHP you are seeing here this index PHP is the same file you can see here in this PHP this is favicon or and all HTML and uh and images so this is where you need to put your all files
