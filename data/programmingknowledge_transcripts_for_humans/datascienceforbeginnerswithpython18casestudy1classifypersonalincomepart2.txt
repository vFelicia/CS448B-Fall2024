00:00 - Oh
00:01 - hello there and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge so this is Ganesh and the last
00:06 - video we had seen the correlation
00:08 - between independent variables and
00:11 - dropping the missing values so in
00:14 - today's video we'll see the cross
00:16 - tabulation and data visualization so
00:19 - let's get started
00:20 - so what we'll do first let me get an
00:23 - idea of how many columns are there in
00:25 - particular data frames so data frame we
00:27 - had was data - you want to see the
00:30 - column so data - dot columns will give
00:34 - us all the columns present in the data
00:37 - frame you can see a job tab salary
00:41 - status so let's see the gender
00:43 - proportion so how you can see the gender
00:46 - proportion so for that we'll need a
00:48 - gender from the data frame and we'll use
00:51 - pandas property cross step function so
00:54 - we create a variable called gender
00:55 - equals to PD dot cross F so in this
01:01 - function
01:02 - we'll pass first parameter as index
01:05 - equals to the data frame column if you
01:09 - want to consider so we'll call theta 2
01:12 - then slicing operator and then the
01:15 - gender that is the column next thing
01:19 - which we want is columns columns we
01:23 - consider as count because we need a
01:27 - count of the gender and then yone
01:32 - proportion so or that will use normalize
01:35 - equals to true and if you now print the
01:42 - gender variable you can see the
01:46 - proportions of female and male in the
01:49 - population so here you can see male
01:51 - proportion is more that is 1667 percent
01:54 - whereas female is 32% so now let's see
01:59 - bivariate analysis so we'll consider two
02:02 - variables gender and salary status and
02:04 - we will find out what is the
02:06 - relationship between them so for that
02:09 - what we can do we'll just create a
02:11 - variable same like gender so we consider
02:14 - gender underscore celery stat equals two
02:19 - will call cost F function again and
02:22 - inside that will pass index equals to
02:25 - which column we want to consider from
02:28 - data frame we want gender and next one
02:35 - is
02:37 - in the columns we considered the salary
02:44 - status that is a column so s al st k t
02:49 - comma along with the gender female and
02:53 - female category you want all category so
02:55 - we'll consider margins equals to true to
02:58 - get that and the next one is normalized
03:01 - so to convert the count into proportions
03:03 - and if you run it and if you just bring
03:08 - this you can see all along with that
03:17 - female male for salary status of greater
03:21 - than 50,000 in less than or equal to
03:23 - 50,000 for two categories you can see
03:25 - that male has thirty percent population
03:29 - who has category of greater than fifty
03:31 - thousand salary and female is only 10%
03:35 - for Katahdin saloon greater than 50,000
03:37 - rupees seller and in the less than or
03:42 - equal to 50,000 category you can see the
03:44 - females as eighty-nine percent whereas
03:46 - giant says 69 percent
03:48 - so overall male has more as compared to
03:52 - humans
03:55 - so let's see the frequency distribution
03:57 - of salary status so for that what we can
04:01 - do is we can draw plot using Saban
04:06 - library so we'll create a variable
04:09 - called sell stat it was - then we'll
04:11 - call SNS that is C bond library and from
04:14 - that we'll call count dot function so in
04:17 - this if you do the celery status column
04:21 - data frame data frame is 0-2 and column
04:26 - name is salary sale stead filter on this
04:29 - we get a count plot and here you can see
04:32 - 75% that is this is less than or equal
04:36 - to 50,000 rupees celery people whereas
04:40 - 25% is greater than 50,000 celerity so
04:43 - now we will see a Quincy distribution of
04:46 - age so how we can see that is you just
04:51 - call the C bond library again to plot or
04:56 - displ ah'd so distraught so as the
05:01 - distribution of age over the intervals
05:04 - so the column which you want to consider
05:07 - each age and then how many number of
05:12 - beans we want so we will consider 10
05:14 - bins that is 10 intervals or columns you
05:16 - can see and the kernel density estimate
05:18 - that is KD we don't want so we'll equal
05:21 - to false so the frequency will come to
05:24 - the y-axis if you keep if you make it KD
05:28 - equal to false it will now run it you
05:31 - can see that
05:33 - the age is given from 0 to 90 and the
05:37 - count is doing here and in here you can
05:39 - see people of age 20 to 45 are in very
05:45 - high fencing
05:47 - whereas other age people are not dead
05:50 - much
05:51 - now we'll do bivariate analysis for for
05:54 - agent sale state there is every status
05:57 - so how we can do is we'll use box plot
05:59 - distance over SNS dot box plot and what
06:04 - we'll plot is will use salary state
06:07 - along with that we want gauge also so
06:12 - we'll compare both of them and data will
06:16 - get it from a data frame data type and
06:21 - we also want to group by this data frame
06:24 - so we will use group by a function so
06:33 - theta 2 dot group by so inside this
06:35 - function will give us our very one that
06:38 - is salary state so later frame will be
06:42 - grouped on the basis of the salary
06:45 - status and in that will use H a slicing
06:52 - operator and we'll consider the medium
06:56 - of that H so solicitous will be grouped
07:06 - by
07:07 - on the basis of age of medium
07:15 - you
07:21 - we now run this
07:28 - so yeah I was pokin spelling mistakes it
07:32 - should be group by and here we can see
07:35 - this a little status so people with 35
07:42 - to 50 age then see 35 to 50 H are more
07:47 - likely to on greater than 50,000 where
07:50 - is people from 25 that is this much to
07:54 - 35 are more likely took on less than or
07:58 - equal to 50,000
08:00 - so this was bivariate analysis for a
08:03 - Josie salary shatters so I want you to
08:06 - kept this for bivariate analysis for job
08:12 - type so top job type is a column job
08:19 - type versus salary status and also for
08:29 - education so compare these columns to
08:37 - find out insights from them so education
08:44 - versus salary status and then also
08:51 - occupation forces salary status also
08:58 - four hours per week versus celery status
09:06 - and also there is own variable called
09:10 - capital capital gain so try to get by
09:16 - rate analysis on the debt also so so
09:22 - this will help you in depth EC and get
09:26 - getting more understanding of pie rate
09:29 - analysis so in the same way like I have
09:33 - done box cod count one dished God
09:37 - we can do biotech analysis for all these
09:40 - columns so guys thank you for watching
09:44 - and I will see you on next video with a
09:46 - different case study
09:48 - you

Cleaned transcript:

Oh hello there and welcome to programming knowledge so this is Ganesh and the last video we had seen the correlation between independent variables and dropping the missing values so in today's video we'll see the cross tabulation and data visualization so let's get started so what we'll do first let me get an idea of how many columns are there in particular data frames so data frame we had was data you want to see the column so data dot columns will give us all the columns present in the data frame you can see a job tab salary status so let's see the gender proportion so how you can see the gender proportion so for that we'll need a gender from the data frame and we'll use pandas property cross step function so we create a variable called gender equals to PD dot cross F so in this function we'll pass first parameter as index equals to the data frame column if you want to consider so we'll call theta 2 then slicing operator and then the gender that is the column next thing which we want is columns columns we consider as count because we need a count of the gender and then yone proportion so or that will use normalize equals to true and if you now print the gender variable you can see the proportions of female and male in the population so here you can see male proportion is more that is 1667 percent whereas female is 32% so now let's see bivariate analysis so we'll consider two variables gender and salary status and we will find out what is the relationship between them so for that what we can do we'll just create a variable same like gender so we consider gender underscore celery stat equals two will call cost F function again and inside that will pass index equals to which column we want to consider from data frame we want gender and next one is in the columns we considered the salary status that is a column so s al st k t comma along with the gender female and female category you want all category so we'll consider margins equals to true to get that and the next one is normalized so to convert the count into proportions and if you run it and if you just bring this you can see all along with that female male for salary status of greater than 50,000 in less than or equal to 50,000 for two categories you can see that male has thirty percent population who has category of greater than fifty thousand salary and female is only 10% for Katahdin saloon greater than 50,000 rupees seller and in the less than or equal to 50,000 category you can see the females as eightynine percent whereas giant says 69 percent so overall male has more as compared to humans so let's see the frequency distribution of salary status so for that what we can do is we can draw plot using Saban library so we'll create a variable called sell stat it was then we'll call SNS that is C bond library and from that we'll call count dot function so in this if you do the celery status column data frame data frame is 02 and column name is salary sale stead filter on this we get a count plot and here you can see 75% that is this is less than or equal to 50,000 rupees celery people whereas 25% is greater than 50,000 celerity so now we will see a Quincy distribution of age so how we can see that is you just call the C bond library again to plot or displ ah'd so distraught so as the distribution of age over the intervals so the column which you want to consider each age and then how many number of beans we want so we will consider 10 bins that is 10 intervals or columns you can see and the kernel density estimate that is KD we don't want so we'll equal to false so the frequency will come to the yaxis if you keep if you make it KD equal to false it will now run it you can see that the age is given from 0 to 90 and the count is doing here and in here you can see people of age 20 to 45 are in very high fencing whereas other age people are not dead much now we'll do bivariate analysis for for agent sale state there is every status so how we can do is we'll use box plot distance over SNS dot box plot and what we'll plot is will use salary state along with that we want gauge also so we'll compare both of them and data will get it from a data frame data type and we also want to group by this data frame so we will use group by a function so theta 2 dot group by so inside this function will give us our very one that is salary state so later frame will be grouped on the basis of the salary status and in that will use H a slicing operator and we'll consider the medium of that H so solicitous will be grouped by on the basis of age of medium you we now run this so yeah I was pokin spelling mistakes it should be group by and here we can see this a little status so people with 35 to 50 age then see 35 to 50 H are more likely to on greater than 50,000 where is people from 25 that is this much to 35 are more likely took on less than or equal to 50,000 so this was bivariate analysis for a Josie salary shatters so I want you to kept this for bivariate analysis for job type so top job type is a column job type versus salary status and also for education so compare these columns to find out insights from them so education versus salary status and then also occupation forces salary status also four hours per week versus celery status and also there is own variable called capital capital gain so try to get by rate analysis on the debt also so so this will help you in depth EC and get getting more understanding of pie rate analysis so in the same way like I have done box cod count one dished God we can do biotech analysis for all these columns so guys thank you for watching and I will see you on next video with a different case study you
