00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - IntelliJ IDEA IDE on your Windows 10
00:07 - operating system so let's start directly
00:11 - by just knowing the prerequisites of
00:14 - installing IntelliJ IDEA so just search
00:18 - for IntelliJ IDEA prerequisites on your
00:22 - favorite browser and the first link
00:25 - which you will see here will be from jet
00:27 - prints so I'm going to just click on the
00:29 - jet brains link which is the company
00:33 - behind IntelliJ IDEA IDE so here I can
00:37 - see there are two versions are available
00:39 - for IntelliJ IDEA IDE we are going to
00:42 - install the community version which is
00:43 - the free and open-source version so this
00:47 - Community Edition provides all the basic
00:49 - features of JVM and Android developments
00:52 - and also in addition you can download
00:56 - this IntelliJ IDEA ultimate version
00:58 - which is the commercial version for
01:00 - which you need to pay to use it so in
01:05 - this video we are going to see how to
01:06 - download this community version now in
01:09 - the system requirements you can see the
01:12 - RAM requirements disk space monitor
01:15 - resolution and operating system
01:16 - requirements here and when I scroll down
01:20 - I can also see that you don't need to
01:24 - install Java to run IntelliJ IDEA
01:27 - because JetBrains runtime is bundled
01:30 - with IDE however it says to develop java
01:35 - applications a standalone jdk is
01:37 - required so what we are going to do is
01:40 - we are going to install the java jdk
01:42 - first of all and then we are going to
01:44 - see how we can install IntelliJ IDEA on
01:47 - our Windows 10 operating system so let's
01:50 - see how we can install java jdk on our
01:53 - Windows 10 operating system so first of
01:56 - all open your favorite browser and
01:58 - search for Java JDK and most probably
02:00 - the first language will appear here will
02:02 - be from Oracle comm so I'm going to just
02:07 - click on this link I will also paste
02:09 - this link in the description of this
02:12 - video
02:13 - now here let me just increase the font
02:16 - size here so you can see it in a better
02:19 - way so here you can see at the time of
02:22 - making this video Java
02:24 - I see 13 is the latest version now when
02:28 - I scroll down Java SE 11 is the long
02:32 - term support version LTS version and
02:35 - also we have the java SE 8 u 2 for one
02:40 - build also so in this video we are going
02:44 - to install the latest version which is
02:47 - the Java SE 13 so just go under Java SE
02:51 - 13 and just click on this option which
02:54 - says JDK download and once this page is
02:58 - open you just need to scroll down a
03:02 - little where it says Java SE development
03:06 - kit 13 point zero point two this is the
03:09 - version at the time of making this video
03:10 - and then you can see all the operating
03:13 - system for which this Java JDK is
03:16 - available now for Windows operating
03:19 - system this JDK windows xst 4 bin dot
03:25 - exe file is available so I'm going to
03:28 - just click on this Exe file not the zip
03:31 - file so I'm going to just click on this
03:32 - exe file here and then I'm going to just
03:36 - say I received and accept the Oracle
03:39 - technology Network License Agreement
03:42 - and then I'm going to just click on this
03:44 - download JDK dot exe file now once this
03:50 - executable file is downloaded I'm going
03:53 - to just click on this executable file
03:55 - and I'm going to minimize my browser and
03:58 - here it says do you want to allow this
04:01 - app to make changes on your device I
04:03 - will say yes and now you can see this
04:05 - initial setup window so I'm going to
04:07 - just click on next here now on this next
04:10 - window this will be the default location
04:12 - where your Java JDK will be installed so
04:17 - if you don't have the good reason to
04:18 - change it I will recommend it to just
04:21 - leave it as it is and just click on Next
04:24 - button and now it's going to
04:27 - copy all these files and in few seconds
04:30 - you will be able to see this message
04:32 - which says that java development kit
04:35 - thirteen point zero point to 64-bit is
04:38 - successfully installed so now I'm going
04:41 - to just close this window and I will go
04:44 - to the location where this Java JDK file
04:49 - is installed on my computer so I will go
04:52 - to this PC C directory and then Program
04:57 - Files and then you can see this Java
05:00 - directory here and inside this Java
05:02 - folder you will be able to see the JDK
05:06 - version you have installed so I have
05:08 - installed the Java JDK thirteen point
05:10 - zero point two so I will just click on
05:12 - this and the important folder here is
05:16 - the bin folder where all the Java
05:20 - related files are present for example
05:23 - Java C dot exe will be there and other
05:27 - Java is a related executable file are
05:30 - all present inside this bin folder so
05:34 - the next step is to set this bin folder
05:38 - as our environment variables so that we
05:43 - can run all the Java related command
05:45 - from the command prompt so just copy
05:49 - this path up to the bin folder of the
05:52 - Java JDK and then go to your windows
05:56 - icon just click on the windows icon and
05:58 - then click on the settings here and in
06:01 - the settings just click on the system
06:04 - option here and here you can search for
06:07 - environment variables so just type
06:10 - environment variables here and you need
06:13 - to choose this option which says added
06:15 - the system environment variables and
06:17 - this is going to open this kind of
06:20 - window so here go to environment
06:22 - variables and here you need to set your
06:26 - environment variables related to Java so
06:30 - here what I'm going to do is I'm going
06:32 - to just click on the path environment
06:35 - variables just click on path environment
06:38 - variable and then click on edit and
06:41 - just paste your part for the Java bin
06:45 - folder at the end okay so this part is
06:49 - see Program Files Java JDK thirteen
06:53 - point zero point two back slash bin and
06:55 - then I'm going to just press ENTER and
06:57 - then I'm going to just click OK and this
07:01 - environment variable is set now also if
07:05 - you want to develop with Java or Java
07:08 - related tools you might also want to set
07:12 - your Java home environment variable so
07:16 - to set the Java home environment
07:18 - variable what you can do is you can just
07:20 - click on the new option here and then
07:24 - the environment variable we need to
07:26 - write here is Java home so variable name
07:29 - is Java underscore home all in capital
07:33 - letters and the value for the variable
07:36 - will be the path up to JDK folder so you
07:41 - don't need to go inside the bin folder
07:43 - you just need to copy this folder path
07:46 - up to the JDK folder so I'm going to
07:49 - just copy this path also and then paste
07:53 - it here as the value for the Java home
07:56 - environment variable so see Program
07:58 - Files Java and then JDK - thirteen point
08:03 - zero point two in my case ok you don't
08:07 - need to give the bin folder path here
08:09 - for the Java home environment variable I
08:12 - will click OK here and you can see this
08:15 - Java home environment variable is set
08:17 - now so I will just click OK and then
08:20 - click OK and then I will close all the
08:23 - windows now I will once again open my
08:27 - command prompt so if you have any
08:29 - previously opened command prompt just
08:32 - close all the command prompt which have
08:35 - previously opened before installing Java
08:39 - and then now open the new command prompt
08:43 - so just type command prompt in the
08:46 - search bar and then open your command
08:48 - prompt here and then we are going to
08:50 - check all the Java related commands one
08:54 - by
08:54 - one so the first command we are going to
08:57 - check is the Java version so just write
09:00 - Java - version here and then press ENTER
09:04 - and it's going to give you the Java
09:07 - version which we have installed we have
09:09 - installed the Java version 13 point zero
09:11 - point two that's why you can see here
09:13 - the Java version also you can see with
09:18 - the Java JDK installation this runtime
09:21 - and environment or Java JRE is
09:24 - automatically installed with the same
09:26 - version so you don't need to install
09:29 - Java JRE separately so now let's see how
09:32 - we can install IntelliJ IDEA so for that
09:34 - you can just search for IntelliJ IDEA on
09:37 - your favorite browser and the first link
09:39 - which will appear here will be from
09:41 - JetBrains comm so just click on this
09:43 - link and once this website opens
09:45 - straight away you will be able to see
09:47 - this download button here and also on
09:49 - the top so I'm going to just click on
09:52 - this Downloads button and straight away
09:54 - you can see ultimate and community
09:56 - version and as I said we are going to
09:58 - download the community version so I'm
10:00 - going to just click on the download
10:01 - button here and after few seconds the
10:04 - download of this IntelliJ IDEA IDE
10:07 - executable file will start so this is
10:10 - around five hundred and forty five
10:12 - megabyte files so it will take some time
10:14 - to download so once this executable file
10:16 - is downloaded we are going to just click
10:18 - on this executable file and I'm going to
10:21 - minimize the browser and just click on
10:24 - yes here and this is the IntelliJ IDEA
10:28 - community edition set of window so we
10:31 - are going to just click on the next
10:32 - button and this will be the location
10:35 - where IntelliJ IDEA will be installed on
10:38 - your Windows 10 operating system so if
10:41 - you don't have the good reason to change
10:42 - it just leave it as default and click on
10:44 - the next button and now you can choose
10:47 - from these options so in the first
10:50 - option create desktop shortcut I'm going
10:53 - to just choose the 64-bit launcher the
10:56 - second option is update context menu yes
10:59 - I want to do that also
11:01 - and then the Association so create
11:05 - associations I can
11:08 - just leave all these files unchecked if
11:12 - you want you can do that also but I
11:15 - don't want to create those associations
11:18 - for now so I will leave everything as
11:20 - unchecked and here update path variables
11:23 - which will require the restart of your
11:27 - Windows operating system so I'm going to
11:30 - just click on this option also which
11:32 - says add launches there to the path ok
11:36 - so these are my options and then I'm
11:38 - going to just click on the next button
11:40 - and then you will see this kind of
11:42 - window so just click on Next button once
11:45 - again and the installation of IntelliJ
11:48 - IDEA IDE will start on your Windows
11:51 - operating system so at this point you
11:53 - just need to wait for this progress to
11:56 - reach to the end and now at this point I
11:59 - can see this window it says completing
12:02 - IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition set up
12:05 - and there are two options here
12:08 - first is reboot now and second is I want
12:11 - to manually reboot later so I can just
12:15 - click on this option which says I want
12:18 - to reboot manually later so I will just
12:20 - leave it as default and I will click on
12:22 - the finish button here and I can see
12:25 - this IntelliJ IDEA icon is created here
12:28 - on the desktop also so let me just
12:30 - manually restart my Windows operating
12:33 - system first of all and then we are
12:35 - going to see how we can create our first
12:37 - Java project so now I have restarted my
12:41 - Windows operating system and now I'm
12:43 - going to just click on the IntelliJ IDEA
12:45 - community as region icon and when you
12:49 - click on this icon the first window you
12:52 - will see here will be the JetBrains
12:54 - privacy policy document window so I will
12:58 - just check this checkbox and then click
13:00 - on the continue button and on the second
13:03 - window it's asking me my consent about
13:06 - the data sharing so I don't want to
13:07 - share anything so I will say don't send
13:09 - and now it starts the IntelliJ IDEA IDE
13:13 - at this point you can choose the theme
13:17 - there are two themes available here
13:19 - first one is
13:21 - kula team and other one is the light
13:24 - theme so for now I'm going to choose the
13:27 - light team because for videos it's
13:30 - better to use the light themes but for
13:33 - the development
13:34 - I definitely prefers the dark killer
13:37 - dream okay so for the video purpose I
13:41 - will choose the light theme here and
13:43 - then I'm going to just click on the next
13:47 - button here you can see a toon IntelliJ
13:50 - IDEA to your task I will leave
13:52 - everything as default and then click on
13:54 - next and on this next window I can see
13:56 - download featured plug-in so you can
13:59 - download and install these plug-ins
14:01 - anytime after the installation process
14:04 - also so for now I'm going to leave
14:07 - everything as default and I'm not going
14:09 - to install anything any extra plug-in
14:11 - and I will say start using IntelliJ IDEA
14:14 - IDE so just click on this button and the
14:18 - IntelliJ IDEA IDE is starting and the
14:21 - first window you will see after
14:24 - installing the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is this
14:28 - window so here you can create a new
14:32 - project so let's create a new project
14:34 - and we are going to create a Java
14:36 - project and now you can choose the
14:40 - language in which you want to develop so
14:43 - I'm going to choose Java by default the
14:46 - project SDK selected here is Java 13
14:50 - because I have already installed Java 13
14:53 - on my Windows operating system
14:55 - separately if you haven't installed JDK
14:59 - you can also download the JDK from here
15:01 - by just clicking on these options ok or
15:05 - you can add the JDK if you have the path
15:08 - of the JDK files and folders okay so by
15:13 - default
15:14 - whatever Java version you have it will
15:16 - be selected by default here and then I'm
15:19 - going to just click on the next button
15:21 - now in here I'm going to just click on
15:23 - create project from template and I only
15:26 - have one option here so I will leave it
15:28 - as default and then click on next and
15:30 - now I can give the name
15:33 - to my project so I'm going to just give
15:35 - the name hello to my project and then
15:39 - click on finish once you click on finish
15:42 - it's going to create all the project
15:44 - templates for you on your IntelliJ IDEA
15:48 - IDE and I'm going to minimize this
15:51 - browser IntelliJ IDEA IDE gives a tip of
15:55 - the day when you start IntelliJ IDEA IDE
15:58 - so I'm going to just click on the close
16:00 - button here and you can see this file is
16:03 - created by IntelliJ IDEA for us if you
16:07 - want to see the project view just click
16:09 - on this project option here and you will
16:12 - be able to see your project structure
16:14 - inside your project so here we have the
16:18 - source file and inside the source file
16:20 - we have this package and then we have
16:23 - this class here so let's try to print
16:25 - something we already have our default
16:28 - main method created by IntelliJ IDEA so
16:31 - I'm going to just remove this comment
16:34 - and I will just type s out here
16:37 - okay so IntelliJ IDEA I have these cool
16:41 - short keys using which you can write
16:45 - your code so s out is for
16:47 - system.out.print line and then press tab
16:51 - key which is going to just give you this
16:54 - code and inside these parenthesis I can
16:57 - just write hello world here and once you
17:02 - have your print line statement you can
17:05 - run your project by just right clicking
17:07 - on the file itself and then click on the
17:10 - run mean button okay so for the first
17:13 - time you can just right click on the
17:16 - file itself and run mean button and once
17:20 - it runs for the first time next time you
17:24 - will be able to run this file from here
17:26 - also okay so I can just do it again from
17:31 - this button it's going to compile and
17:33 - run your Java project I can just change
17:36 - this output and then run this code once
17:40 - again it's going to print HelloWorld
17:44 - with the
17:45 - these symbols right so this is how you
17:49 - can download and install IntelliJ IDEA
17:52 - on your Windows 10 operating system and
17:55 - create your first java project in
17:58 - IntelliJ IDEA IDE so I hope you've
18:02 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
18:04 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install IntelliJ IDEA IDE on your Windows 10 operating system so let's start directly by just knowing the prerequisites of installing IntelliJ IDEA so just search for IntelliJ IDEA prerequisites on your favorite browser and the first link which you will see here will be from jet prints so I'm going to just click on the jet brains link which is the company behind IntelliJ IDEA IDE so here I can see there are two versions are available for IntelliJ IDEA IDE we are going to install the community version which is the free and opensource version so this Community Edition provides all the basic features of JVM and Android developments and also in addition you can download this IntelliJ IDEA ultimate version which is the commercial version for which you need to pay to use it so in this video we are going to see how to download this community version now in the system requirements you can see the RAM requirements disk space monitor resolution and operating system requirements here and when I scroll down I can also see that you don't need to install Java to run IntelliJ IDEA because JetBrains runtime is bundled with IDE however it says to develop java applications a standalone jdk is required so what we are going to do is we are going to install the java jdk first of all and then we are going to see how we can install IntelliJ IDEA on our Windows 10 operating system so let's see how we can install java jdk on our Windows 10 operating system so first of all open your favorite browser and search for Java JDK and most probably the first language will appear here will be from Oracle comm so I'm going to just click on this link I will also paste this link in the description of this video now here let me just increase the font size here so you can see it in a better way so here you can see at the time of making this video Java I see 13 is the latest version now when I scroll down Java SE 11 is the long term support version LTS version and also we have the java SE 8 u 2 for one build also so in this video we are going to install the latest version which is the Java SE 13 so just go under Java SE 13 and just click on this option which says JDK download and once this page is open you just need to scroll down a little where it says Java SE development kit 13 point zero point two this is the version at the time of making this video and then you can see all the operating system for which this Java JDK is available now for Windows operating system this JDK windows xst 4 bin dot exe file is available so I'm going to just click on this Exe file not the zip file so I'm going to just click on this exe file here and then I'm going to just say I received and accept the Oracle technology Network License Agreement and then I'm going to just click on this download JDK dot exe file now once this executable file is downloaded I'm going to just click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize my browser and here it says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device I will say yes and now you can see this initial setup window so I'm going to just click on next here now on this next window this will be the default location where your Java JDK will be installed so if you don't have the good reason to change it I will recommend it to just leave it as it is and just click on Next button and now it's going to copy all these files and in few seconds you will be able to see this message which says that java development kit thirteen point zero point to 64bit is successfully installed so now I'm going to just close this window and I will go to the location where this Java JDK file is installed on my computer so I will go to this PC C directory and then Program Files and then you can see this Java directory here and inside this Java folder you will be able to see the JDK version you have installed so I have installed the Java JDK thirteen point zero point two so I will just click on this and the important folder here is the bin folder where all the Java related files are present for example Java C dot exe will be there and other Java is a related executable file are all present inside this bin folder so the next step is to set this bin folder as our environment variables so that we can run all the Java related command from the command prompt so just copy this path up to the bin folder of the Java JDK and then go to your windows icon just click on the windows icon and then click on the settings here and in the settings just click on the system option here and here you can search for environment variables so just type environment variables here and you need to choose this option which says added the system environment variables and this is going to open this kind of window so here go to environment variables and here you need to set your environment variables related to Java so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to just click on the path environment variables just click on path environment variable and then click on edit and just paste your part for the Java bin folder at the end okay so this part is see Program Files Java JDK thirteen point zero point two back slash bin and then I'm going to just press ENTER and then I'm going to just click OK and this environment variable is set now also if you want to develop with Java or Java related tools you might also want to set your Java home environment variable so to set the Java home environment variable what you can do is you can just click on the new option here and then the environment variable we need to write here is Java home so variable name is Java underscore home all in capital letters and the value for the variable will be the path up to JDK folder so you don't need to go inside the bin folder you just need to copy this folder path up to the JDK folder so I'm going to just copy this path also and then paste it here as the value for the Java home environment variable so see Program Files Java and then JDK thirteen point zero point two in my case ok you don't need to give the bin folder path here for the Java home environment variable I will click OK here and you can see this Java home environment variable is set now so I will just click OK and then click OK and then I will close all the windows now I will once again open my command prompt so if you have any previously opened command prompt just close all the command prompt which have previously opened before installing Java and then now open the new command prompt so just type command prompt in the search bar and then open your command prompt here and then we are going to check all the Java related commands one by one so the first command we are going to check is the Java version so just write Java version here and then press ENTER and it's going to give you the Java version which we have installed we have installed the Java version 13 point zero point two that's why you can see here the Java version also you can see with the Java JDK installation this runtime and environment or Java JRE is automatically installed with the same version so you don't need to install Java JRE separately so now let's see how we can install IntelliJ IDEA so for that you can just search for IntelliJ IDEA on your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be from JetBrains comm so just click on this link and once this website opens straight away you will be able to see this download button here and also on the top so I'm going to just click on this Downloads button and straight away you can see ultimate and community version and as I said we are going to download the community version so I'm going to just click on the download button here and after few seconds the download of this IntelliJ IDEA IDE executable file will start so this is around five hundred and forty five megabyte files so it will take some time to download so once this executable file is downloaded we are going to just click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize the browser and just click on yes here and this is the IntelliJ IDEA community edition set of window so we are going to just click on the next button and this will be the location where IntelliJ IDEA will be installed on your Windows 10 operating system so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default and click on the next button and now you can choose from these options so in the first option create desktop shortcut I'm going to just choose the 64bit launcher the second option is update context menu yes I want to do that also and then the Association so create associations I can just leave all these files unchecked if you want you can do that also but I don't want to create those associations for now so I will leave everything as unchecked and here update path variables which will require the restart of your Windows operating system so I'm going to just click on this option also which says add launches there to the path ok so these are my options and then I'm going to just click on the next button and then you will see this kind of window so just click on Next button once again and the installation of IntelliJ IDEA IDE will start on your Windows operating system so at this point you just need to wait for this progress to reach to the end and now at this point I can see this window it says completing IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition set up and there are two options here first is reboot now and second is I want to manually reboot later so I can just click on this option which says I want to reboot manually later so I will just leave it as default and I will click on the finish button here and I can see this IntelliJ IDEA icon is created here on the desktop also so let me just manually restart my Windows operating system first of all and then we are going to see how we can create our first Java project so now I have restarted my Windows operating system and now I'm going to just click on the IntelliJ IDEA community as region icon and when you click on this icon the first window you will see here will be the JetBrains privacy policy document window so I will just check this checkbox and then click on the continue button and on the second window it's asking me my consent about the data sharing so I don't want to share anything so I will say don't send and now it starts the IntelliJ IDEA IDE at this point you can choose the theme there are two themes available here first one is kula team and other one is the light theme so for now I'm going to choose the light team because for videos it's better to use the light themes but for the development I definitely prefers the dark killer dream okay so for the video purpose I will choose the light theme here and then I'm going to just click on the next button here you can see a toon IntelliJ IDEA to your task I will leave everything as default and then click on next and on this next window I can see download featured plugin so you can download and install these plugins anytime after the installation process also so for now I'm going to leave everything as default and I'm not going to install anything any extra plugin and I will say start using IntelliJ IDEA IDE so just click on this button and the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is starting and the first window you will see after installing the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is this window so here you can create a new project so let's create a new project and we are going to create a Java project and now you can choose the language in which you want to develop so I'm going to choose Java by default the project SDK selected here is Java 13 because I have already installed Java 13 on my Windows operating system separately if you haven't installed JDK you can also download the JDK from here by just clicking on these options ok or you can add the JDK if you have the path of the JDK files and folders okay so by default whatever Java version you have it will be selected by default here and then I'm going to just click on the next button now in here I'm going to just click on create project from template and I only have one option here so I will leave it as default and then click on next and now I can give the name to my project so I'm going to just give the name hello to my project and then click on finish once you click on finish it's going to create all the project templates for you on your IntelliJ IDEA IDE and I'm going to minimize this browser IntelliJ IDEA IDE gives a tip of the day when you start IntelliJ IDEA IDE so I'm going to just click on the close button here and you can see this file is created by IntelliJ IDEA for us if you want to see the project view just click on this project option here and you will be able to see your project structure inside your project so here we have the source file and inside the source file we have this package and then we have this class here so let's try to print something we already have our default main method created by IntelliJ IDEA so I'm going to just remove this comment and I will just type s out here okay so IntelliJ IDEA I have these cool short keys using which you can write your code so s out is for system.out.print line and then press tab key which is going to just give you this code and inside these parenthesis I can just write hello world here and once you have your print line statement you can run your project by just right clicking on the file itself and then click on the run mean button okay so for the first time you can just right click on the file itself and run mean button and once it runs for the first time next time you will be able to run this file from here also okay so I can just do it again from this button it's going to compile and run your Java project I can just change this output and then run this code once again it's going to print HelloWorld with the these symbols right so this is how you can download and install IntelliJ IDEA on your Windows 10 operating system and create your first java project in IntelliJ IDEA IDE so I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video
