00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video we will see that
00:06 - if you want to create a table based on
00:10 - table which is already exist in your
00:13 - database then how you can do that so let
00:18 - me just open terminal make it bigger
00:26 - MySQL - you wrote happy
00:33 - provide password so let me show you
00:44 - which are the tablets that we have here
00:51 - we have database database here we just
00:54 - use that
01:04 - let me say which other tables we have to
01:11 - run table spoon to table after to table
01:15 - so let me see the structure of this
01:21 - turntable so we use describe command if
01:27 - you don't know about describe statement
01:31 - then you can see in our video I have
01:36 - talked about describe in our earlier
01:39 - video so it has the roll number integer
01:47 - length of 11 name and surname and data
01:52 - type of vector and length of 45 and the
01:56 - roll number is of a primary key so now I
02:00 - want to create a new table which is this
02:04 - same structure the student has so I do
02:09 - not need to write all these column names
02:14 - and data types and constant explicitly
02:17 - it can adapt the constraint as well as
02:21 - the data type the whole structure which
02:25 - every student has and the only thing it
02:29 - cannot do is that it cannot copy the
02:34 - records which are present in your source
02:36 - table let me show you
02:45 - it has this much of Records if you
02:48 - create a new table from this table then
02:52 - it just have the structure like this it
02:56 - won't have these records okay so what is
03:02 - the statement the statement is simple
03:05 - create table the name of table like temp
03:14 - underscore student let's say like now
03:21 - the name of the source type okay so let
03:31 - me just see show tables so it is created
03:37 - test student let me show the structure
03:48 - so as you can see it has the same
03:51 - structure as student okay select star
04:00 - from temp underscore as you can see it
04:12 - doesn't contain any records well our
04:14 - store table which is student contains
04:18 - this much of record so it is copy the
04:20 - structure of the source table it is
04:24 - close this up on my skill but hunch and
04:29 - see how to use this segment in egy so
04:35 - let me create this time create tables
04:44 - table name will be let's set the MP
04:50 - like we have 10 - students time - sorry
04:57 - table here okay so now refresh you first
05:08 - of all see the structure of 10 it has
05:13 - roll number name and surname and salary
05:15 - it export folder and time true this is
05:24 - this source table from which we have
05:26 - created new Tamil time
05:28 - it has roll number men surname and
05:30 - salary and the new table that we have
05:32 - created them also has rolling of name
05:36 - and salary so this is how you can create
05:40 - a new tables from the existing table you
05:43 - do not need to require multiple
05:47 - statement to do that you can simply
05:51 - create a new table from general the
05:54 - table so thanks for watching

hello friends welcome to programming knowledge in this video we will see that if you want to create a table based on table which is already exist in your database then how you can do that so let me just open terminal make it bigger MySQL you wrote happy provide password so let me show you which are the tablets that we have here we have database database here we just use that let me say which other tables we have to run table spoon to table after to table so let me see the structure of this turntable so we use describe command if you don't know about describe statement then you can see in our video I have talked about describe in our earlier video so it has the roll number integer length of 11 name and surname and data type of vector and length of 45 and the roll number is of a primary key so now I want to create a new table which is this same structure the student has so I do not need to write all these column names and data types and constant explicitly it can adapt the constraint as well as the data type the whole structure which every student has and the only thing it cannot do is that it cannot copy the records which are present in your source table let me show you it has this much of Records if you create a new table from this table then it just have the structure like this it won't have these records okay so what is the statement the statement is simple create table the name of table like temp underscore student let's say like now the name of the source type okay so let me just see show tables so it is created test student let me show the structure so as you can see it has the same structure as student okay select star from temp underscore as you can see it doesn't contain any records well our store table which is student contains this much of record so it is copy the structure of the source table it is close this up on my skill but hunch and see how to use this segment in egy so let me create this time create tables table name will be let's set the MP like we have 10 students time sorry table here okay so now refresh you first of all see the structure of 10 it has roll number name and surname and salary it export folder and time true this is this source table from which we have created new Tamil time it has roll number men surname and salary and the new table that we have created them also has rolling of name and salary so this is how you can create a new tables from the existing table you do not need to require multiple statement to do that you can simply create a new table from general the table so thanks for watching
