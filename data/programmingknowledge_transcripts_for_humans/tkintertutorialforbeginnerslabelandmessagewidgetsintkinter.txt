00:03 - hey everyone so to display text on the
00:07 - tank top window we just have learned
00:08 - about the create text function in canvas
00:10 - but we also have label and message to
00:13 - print a message on the screen to get
00:16 - text on screen so we haven't discussed
00:18 - that yet that's what we are going to
00:20 - talk about today we will learn about the
00:23 - label and message widgets
00:25 - there is just a little difference
00:27 - between label and message let's write
00:29 - some code to check that out
00:31 - so from thinker
00:35 - import Star
00:38 - and I'll have my window right when TK
00:43 - packets
00:45 - I'll given a title I'll write win dot
00:47 - title
00:49 - display text
00:54 - let the title be display text
00:57 - now I'm gonna add my widget
01:00 - that is message and I will given a
01:03 - variable I'll write
01:05 - my message
01:11 - equals message
01:15 - and where do I want that I want it on
01:17 - the main screen
01:18 - so I'll write when
01:21 - comma what is the text that we want to
01:24 - display so the text equals
01:30 - hello everyone
01:34 - kindly pay attention
01:41 - we are learning
01:44 - tinker
01:45 - cool
01:47 - and then we'll give in a background
01:49 - color
01:51 - I'll write PG equals
01:53 - I think
01:56 - okay then I'll give an aspect so aspect
02:00 - is the ratio
02:02 - basically it's aspect ratio it's the
02:05 - ratio of width and height in percent the
02:08 - default is 150 which means the
02:12 - width would be 50 percent greater than
02:15 - the height of the message box
02:16 - so you can think of on your own what
02:19 - aspect you would give in I will give in
02:22 - an aspect of
02:25 - 500
02:27 - and then
02:29 - I will give an border with it will be 5
02:33 - PD equals five
02:36 - I've also given a type of water relief
02:39 - equals rich
02:42 - I've given a padding
02:44 - fad x equals 10 just along the x-axis
02:49 - okay also the foreground let it be dark
02:52 - blue
02:55 - I can also given a font Let It Be ink
02:59 - free
03:01 - 14 and atomic
03:03 - so that's the way you can given a font
03:06 - that's how you describe a font in Tinker
03:10 - then you can just look up what all
03:13 - arguments you can given for message
03:16 - so we have already described master
03:20 - we have not talked about anchors so
03:23 - anchor is used to decide where the text
03:25 - should be placed in the message widget
03:27 - it can be North North East
03:31 - the top right corner
03:33 - east south east south Southwest or
03:37 - Center the default is Center
03:39 - do not get confused between justify and
03:42 - anchor anchor is for possession whereas
03:45 - justify is like alignment okay
03:49 - then we have aspect we just discussed it
03:52 - we have decided the background
03:55 - and water and the font for round color
03:59 - too
04:00 - we know about justify
04:03 - we can given a padding pad by and Pat X
04:07 - we know about relief we know about text
04:11 - and you can also given the width but I
04:14 - have not given it that's fine I have
04:17 - already given in the aspect
04:19 - then I'll get to the label
04:22 - I'll write label
04:24 - equals label
04:29 - so for the master it would be win again
04:33 - and then text
04:35 - Let It Be
04:36 - label which it does not allow multiple
04:39 - lines
04:52 - okay so this is a fact label widget
04:55 - would not let you get a long text in
04:58 - several lines
05:01 - there is no line wrap-up option so it
05:05 - will just cut off the text that does not
05:08 - fit into the specified height and width
05:10 - so if you have mentioned a smaller size
05:13 - the text will just disappear and not all
05:17 - the text would appear on the screen
05:19 - cool
05:20 - so
05:22 - this is one difference between message
05:24 - and label widget there are many
05:27 - but this is a major one then I will
05:30 - given the Border
05:32 - size let it be eight
05:35 - let the background be
05:37 - sky blue
05:40 - and I'll have a cursor for this
05:44 - that the cursor
05:46 - the cross
05:48 - foreground Let It Be
05:51 - yellow and I'll also given a font here
05:54 - right Georgia
05:59 - 18 italic
06:03 - relief
06:07 - raised
06:10 - height let it be two
06:13 - and I'll not given the width let the
06:16 - label widget decided on its own
06:18 - according to the text
06:20 - now I'll pack this
06:22 - but first I'll pack the label then I'll
06:26 - pack the message okay
06:28 - now let's see if the packing order
06:31 - affects the order of display or is it
06:34 - the order of defining the widgets that
06:36 - decide in which order the widgets would
06:38 - be displayed
06:40 - so I'll write down
06:43 - label dot pack
06:46 - I'll simply use spark and then
06:50 - I'll also pack the message widget
06:55 - dot back
06:57 - now I will call the main Loop
06:59 - wind dot main Loop
07:02 - fine
07:03 - let's check out how the label and
07:05 - message widgets work

hey everyone so to display text on the tank top window we just have learned about the create text function in canvas but we also have label and message to print a message on the screen to get text on screen so we haven't discussed that yet that's what we are going to talk about today we will learn about the label and message widgets there is just a little difference between label and message let's write some code to check that out so from thinker import Star and I'll have my window right when TK packets I'll given a title I'll write win dot title display text let the title be display text now I'm gonna add my widget that is message and I will given a variable I'll write my message equals message and where do I want that I want it on the main screen so I'll write when comma what is the text that we want to display so the text equals hello everyone kindly pay attention we are learning tinker cool and then we'll give in a background color I'll write PG equals I think okay then I'll give an aspect so aspect is the ratio basically it's aspect ratio it's the ratio of width and height in percent the default is 150 which means the width would be 50 percent greater than the height of the message box so you can think of on your own what aspect you would give in I will give in an aspect of 500 and then I will give an border with it will be 5 PD equals five I've also given a type of water relief equals rich I've given a padding fad x equals 10 just along the xaxis okay also the foreground let it be dark blue I can also given a font Let It Be ink free 14 and atomic so that's the way you can given a font that's how you describe a font in Tinker then you can just look up what all arguments you can given for message so we have already described master we have not talked about anchors so anchor is used to decide where the text should be placed in the message widget it can be North North East the top right corner east south east south Southwest or Center the default is Center do not get confused between justify and anchor anchor is for possession whereas justify is like alignment okay then we have aspect we just discussed it we have decided the background and water and the font for round color too we know about justify we can given a padding pad by and Pat X we know about relief we know about text and you can also given the width but I have not given it that's fine I have already given in the aspect then I'll get to the label I'll write label equals label so for the master it would be win again and then text Let It Be label which it does not allow multiple lines okay so this is a fact label widget would not let you get a long text in several lines there is no line wrapup option so it will just cut off the text that does not fit into the specified height and width so if you have mentioned a smaller size the text will just disappear and not all the text would appear on the screen cool so this is one difference between message and label widget there are many but this is a major one then I will given the Border size let it be eight let the background be sky blue and I'll have a cursor for this that the cursor the cross foreground Let It Be yellow and I'll also given a font here right Georgia 18 italic relief raised height let it be two and I'll not given the width let the label widget decided on its own according to the text now I'll pack this but first I'll pack the label then I'll pack the message okay now let's see if the packing order affects the order of display or is it the order of defining the widgets that decide in which order the widgets would be displayed so I'll write down label dot pack I'll simply use spark and then I'll also pack the message widget dot back now I will call the main Loop wind dot main Loop fine let's check out how the label and message widgets work
