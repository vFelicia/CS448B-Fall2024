00:01 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - radis on your Mac operating system so
00:07 - let's get started and let's see how we
00:09 - can install redis on our Mac so first of
00:12 - all open up your favorite browser and
00:14 - search for redis and the first link
00:17 - which will appear here will be from
00:18 - redis doio so we will just click this
00:21 - link which is redis doio and here we can
00:26 - see the homepage of redis what we want
00:29 - to do here is we want to go to the
00:32 - downloads uh section so we will just
00:35 - click this option which says
00:37 - download and then when we scroll down a
00:40 - little we can see this downloads button
00:44 - but don't click this download button yet
00:46 - we will see how to install redis on our
00:50 - Mac uh while scrolling down a little so
00:54 - when we scroll down a little here you
00:57 - can see the installation steps for redis
01:00 - so first we need to download this tar
01:02 - file and then we need to uh unzip or
01:06 - untar this uh tar file and then we need
01:10 - to make the reddis binaries right now
01:14 - let's see what is the latest version at
01:16 - the time of making this video uh for the
01:19 - redis so we can see in the downloads
01:23 - button that
01:25 - 4.0.0 is the latest stable version at
01:29 - the time of making this video right so
01:31 - we will install the
01:33 - 4.0.0 version of
01:35 - redis now sometimes uh this wcat command
01:40 - may not work on your Mac operating
01:43 - system so we will use the curl command
01:47 - to download this star file okay so
01:50 - instead of wget we will use the curl
01:53 - command and then we will follow the same
01:56 - procedure as described here with some
02:00 - additional commands Okay so what we will
02:04 - do first is on my desktop for example or
02:08 - at your chosen location just create a
02:11 - folder so I'm going to create a folder
02:13 - and I'm going to name it as uh redis
02:17 - okay so inside this redis directory I'm
02:21 - going to just uh download this star file
02:24 - and untar it and then make the binaries
02:27 - out of it okay so then once I have this
02:31 - uh folder I will just uh see the info
02:34 - get the info and then uh just see what
02:38 - is the path of this redis directory and
02:41 - I'm going to copy it and then I'm going
02:43 - to open a terminal so just open a
02:46 - terminal and then just CD to this redis
02:51 - directory so because it's on my desktop
02:55 - I can just uh use this or location so
02:58 - user and then whatever is your username
03:01 - and then forward slash desktop and then
03:04 - forward slash RIS I just need to write
03:07 - for SL redis and then I'm inside this
03:12 - redis folder right now we will do the
03:16 - Lis and there is nothing inside this uh
03:18 - redis folder and let's just open this
03:21 - folder so we will see what's happening
03:24 - inside this folder okay so let me just
03:28 - resize it so we will see all the things
03:31 - which are happening here and now we will
03:34 - just give a curl command so just write
03:37 - curl and then minus o and then the
03:42 - location of this uh tar file so just
03:46 - copy this uh URL from here which is
03:50 - there on the downloads page without wet
03:54 - okay so just copy this uh URL and then
03:58 - uh paste it here
04:00 - on the terminal and then press enter
04:03 - which is going to download this star
04:05 - file and once it's downloaded we will
04:09 - just uh untar it so you can see the star
04:12 - file is downloaded right and to uh untar
04:17 - it or extract it we will use this
04:19 - command so right click copy and then
04:24 - just paste it here which is going to
04:28 - extract this uh tar file and we can see
04:32 - this uh folder is extracted and inside
04:37 - this folder we have uh some files right
04:40 - so the next step is to CD to this uh
04:43 - directory which is redis minus
04:46 - 4.0.0 and then make it right so you can
04:50 - see the step CD to this 4.0.0 directory
04:54 - and give the make command so we will do
04:56 - the same CD to the right this 4.0.0
05:01 - directory and then give a make Command
05:04 - which is going to uh make the binaries
05:07 - for the redis server and redis client
05:10 - and other redis stuff right so now the
05:13 - make is finished and At Last I can see
05:17 - this message which says uh it's a good
05:20 - idea to run make test so let's run make
05:23 - test I'm going to just give this command
05:26 - which is make test and then press enter
05:29 - so now the make test command is also
05:31 - finished and I can see this message
05:33 - which says all test passed without error
05:36 - right so I know that everything is okay
05:39 - and now I can start the reddis server
05:42 - and then redis client okay so let's see
05:46 - what are the command for for those so
05:49 - reddest server can be Started From the
05:52 - Source directory and we just need to run
05:55 - this command which is Redd server and
05:58 - the same we need to do for redis client
06:02 - so from The Source directory we can just
06:04 - uh run this redis CLI right so let's do
06:08 - this so I'm going to uh open a new
06:12 - terminal so let me open a new terminal
06:16 - so now I have two terminals right so on
06:20 - the first terminal I will just uh do
06:22 - first of all LS here or let me clear the
06:25 - terminal first of all so clear and then
06:28 - I will do LS here here and I can see
06:31 - there is a source directory here so I
06:34 - will just uh give this command SRC and
06:38 - then
06:40 - redis minus server right so redis minus
06:45 - server and press enter which is going to
06:47 - start the reddish server and it has
06:51 - started listening on this port which is
06:53 - the default port for redis which is
06:57 - 6379 and this is the P ID of This redis
07:00 - Server right now once again I will
07:03 - navigate to this uh directory where I
07:05 - have installed redis so it's in my
07:09 - desktop and then uh I'll go to the redit
07:13 - directory then the redis
07:16 - 4.0.0 and then I will just give this
07:19 - command which is
07:21 - SRC slash redus CLI so let me do LS so I
07:27 - know that I'm in the same directory
07:30 - and then I will just write SRC and then
07:34 - redis
07:36 - CLI and I'm connected to the redish
07:39 - server I can see this uh kind of prompt
07:43 - here that means I'm connected to my
07:45 - reddish server right so first to test
07:50 - whether everything is working fine or
07:52 - not you just need to write ping here and
07:56 - then press enter and if in return you
07:59 - get pong then you know that everything
08:02 - is working fine you can also set
08:05 - something so for example set name is
08:08 - equal to Max and then press enter and
08:12 - then you can get the name so get uh name
08:16 - and then you can get the name okay and
08:19 - then you can uh give the save command to
08:22 - save everything for example
08:25 - right so everything is working fine but
08:28 - for example ex Le when I open a new
08:32 - terminal and I want to run redis CLI for
08:36 - example from here how can I do it so I
08:39 - just want to write redis minus CLI and I
08:44 - want to run it so let me just correct
08:47 - the spelling here so red is CLI and I
08:50 - want to run it and it says command not
08:53 - found because right now the reddest CLI
08:57 - command can be only run from this
09:01 - directory right so you need to CD to
09:04 - this directory and then run the redis
09:07 - command so how to solve this problem so
09:10 - this problem can be solved by running
09:12 - the make install command inside your
09:15 - redest directory so I'm going to just
09:18 - stop the server for now and now uh I
09:22 - will once again do for example PWD so
09:27 - you know that in which directory I am in
09:30 - so I'm in my redis
09:32 - 4.0.0 directory right let me clear the
09:36 - terminal so you will be able to see
09:38 - better so PWD present working directory
09:42 - and you can see I'm in my uh desktop
09:46 - directory and then there is a redis
09:49 - directory here which is this one and
09:52 - then we are in the redis
09:55 - 4.0.0 directory right so we have run
09:58 - here the m
09:59 - and make test command and you just need
10:02 - to write make install command here with
10:06 - the Pudo uh privileges so you just need
10:10 - to write Pudo make install here and then
10:13 - press enter and you just need to give
10:16 - your max password here and then press
10:19 - enter and then it'll start the make
10:23 - install uh command and then you can see
10:26 - everything is uh installed and now you
10:30 - can run uh redis server and redis CLI
10:34 - from anywhere right so let me just close
10:38 - this terminal and close this terminal
10:41 - also let me just terminate everything
10:44 - and I will open a new uh terminal so
10:48 - that we can check whether it's running
10:50 - from uh any other place other than this
10:53 - red is folder or not so I will start two
10:57 - uh terminals in the first first terminal
10:59 - I will write redis uh server and it
11:04 - starts from my home directory and now I
11:07 - will give the redis CLI command so just
11:11 - give redis CLI and then I'm connected to
11:15 - This Server right so everything is
11:18 - working fine and now you can start uh
11:21 - redish server and you can use right a
11:24 - CLI command from anywhere from your uh
11:28 - directory St structure right so in this
11:31 - way you can download and install redis
11:33 - on your Mac operating system I hope you
11:35 - enjoyed this video please to comment and

version at the time of making this video uh for the redis so we can see in the downloads button that 4.0.0 is the latest stable version at the time of making this video right so we will install the
