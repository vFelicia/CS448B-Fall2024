00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:06 - how we can apply styles to the
00:09 - components in android so for example I
00:13 - have these two large text and two
00:16 - buttons here so I want to change the
00:20 - style of these text boxes and these
00:23 - buttons one way of doing this is just
00:26 - select your text area or text box and go
00:30 - to the property here and change the
00:33 - properties as you wish the other way of
00:36 - doing this is go to the folder called
00:39 - values here and then go to the file
00:42 - called styles dot XML and here we can
00:45 - define the styles to our components
00:47 - right so let's see how we can do this so
00:51 - first of all what I'm going to do is I'm
00:53 - going to remove all the styles which are
00:56 - by default given to these text box and
01:01 - this button so I will go to the text
01:03 - section of this activity and I will
01:07 - remove the layout width layout height
01:10 - and text appearance from here okay for
01:13 - each and every component so I will do it
01:16 - for text view and I will do it for a
01:19 - button like this okay
01:23 - now you will notice when you go to the
01:26 - design it will give you this rendering
01:28 - problem because we have just deleted the
01:31 - layout width and layout height and
01:34 - appearance of these text boxes and
01:37 - button right now to give the styles
01:40 - which you want you just need to go to
01:42 - this styles XML file and in here we can
01:46 - define a style for example first of all
01:49 - you just need to give this style
01:51 - attribute here and then the name of the
01:54 - style so the name of the style depends
01:57 - upon you but it should be unique name
02:00 - for example my tile one for example
02:04 - right and then just close the style
02:07 - right and inside the style you can add
02:10 - some items related to
02:13 - appearance or width or height or
02:15 - whatever right so we can add an item and
02:19 - then we can decide what item or what
02:22 - attribute we want to add so for example
02:25 - I want to add the text style to the text
02:29 - view right so I will do this and then
02:32 - inside the textile I can write bold okay
02:36 - in the same way I can add one more item
02:39 - for example item and this time I want to
02:43 - change the text color right so text
02:48 - color now for the text color what you
02:51 - can do is you can search on your browser
02:55 - the web color Wikipedia page and in here
02:58 - you can find all the web colors and
03:02 - their code right so for example I want
03:05 - to choose this red color I can choose it
03:09 - from copying this hash and FF and then
03:14 - for zeros from here right so copy it go
03:17 - to your project and paste it here and
03:20 - with the hash and you will notice it
03:23 - will show a red color here right so we
03:26 - know it's red color right now we will
03:29 - add one more item and this time we want
03:33 - to choose the text appearance
03:37 - okay so choose text appearance and close
03:40 - it here and for the text appearance you
03:43 - can give Android style and then the text
03:50 - appearance and then the large text
03:55 - appearance so you can just choose large
03:57 - okay and now we can define the layout
04:01 - width and layout height of the style
04:05 - okay so just add an item here and then
04:10 - we will choose Android layout width
04:14 - first so layout width and this will be
04:19 - for example match parent and in the same
04:23 - way we can just copy this
04:26 - this time we can choose the layout
04:28 - height right so layout height and this
04:31 - will be for example wrap content okay so
04:35 - this is our first style which we can do
04:38 - in the same way we can define multiple
04:41 - styles with different names so for
04:45 - example I want to add one more style I
04:46 - can do it like this but this time I will
04:49 - give it a name my style too and this
04:52 - time the textile will be for example
04:57 - italic and this color let's choose some
05:01 - other color from here for example I want
05:04 - to choose the green color I will just
05:06 - copy this and paste it here right so it
05:10 - will become the green color okay now in
05:14 - order to give the style to your button
05:17 - or text boxes you just need to go to the
05:19 - text here and in here you just need to
05:23 - give the style attribute so give style
05:26 - and then style and then choose your
05:30 - style so if your style is my style one
05:34 - for example you can do it like this and
05:36 - in the text view second also you can
05:39 - inherit from this style and for example
05:42 - for buttons I want to give the style too
05:46 - so my style two here right and for the
05:50 - second button also I want to do this
05:52 - okay and now when you go to the design
05:54 - you will see the text with bold and red
05:58 - color and button with italic and green
06:02 - color right so in this way you can apply
06:05 - styles to your component in Android I
