00:00 - hi guys welcome back to our new course
00:02 - on data visualization with pandas in
00:06 - this course we are going to study the
00:08 - inbuilt data visualization abilities of
00:11 - pandas this is gonna be an introductory
00:14 - video
00:15 - so let's get started
00:18 - so our first question is what is Theta
00:21 - visualization data and information
00:23 - visualization popularly called as
00:26 - database or Infosys is an
00:29 - interdisciplinary field that deals with
00:32 - the graphic representation of data and
00:34 - information it is particularly efficient
00:37 - way of communicating when the data or
00:40 - the information is numerous for example
00:43 - the time series Theta
00:46 - by using visual elements like charts
00:48 - graphs and Maps data visualization tools
00:52 - provide an accessible way to analyze and
00:55 - understand Trends outliers and patterns
00:58 - and data so basically what is the
01:01 - benefit of data visualization is that it
01:04 - helps to analyze Theta in a better way
01:07 - and predict the future values or
01:11 - outcomes of data
01:14 - now let's move on to our next question
01:16 - which is is data visualization an art or
01:20 - a science so we know that data and
01:23 - information visualization has its roots
01:25 - in the feed of statistics and is
01:28 - therefore generally considered a branch
01:30 - of descriptive statistics however both
01:34 - design skills are statistical and
01:37 - Computing skills are required to
01:39 - visualize data effectively it is argued
01:42 - that it is both an art and a science
01:45 - this is because
01:47 - data visualization has its Concepts
01:50 - based on descriptive statistics while
01:55 - to draw plots or Maps we require design
01:58 - skills so that's why it's both an art
02:01 - and a science also please note that the
02:04 - study of Statistics has two major
02:06 - branches the descriptive statistics
02:09 - involves organization summarization and
02:12 - display of data while the inferential
02:14 - statistics involves using a sample to
02:18 - draw out conclusions about a population
02:20 - now let's move on to our next topic
02:23 - which is why data visualization or what
02:27 - are the benefits of data visualization
02:29 - the first one is visualize Theta is
02:33 - processed faster the second one is data
02:36 - visualization dashboard supports visual
02:39 - Learners so there are some people who
02:41 - can't understand Trends from the text or
02:45 - the numeric data easily so data
02:47 - visualization is very important for
02:49 - these people or the visual Learners
02:52 - third one is that data visualization
02:55 - tools show in sites that may be missed
02:58 - in traditional reports we know that the
03:00 - numeric
03:01 - reports are very long and lengthy and
03:05 - it's easier to miss Trends or insights
03:08 - from those reports so data visualization
03:10 - helps to visualize
03:12 - those reports and find out the trends
03:15 - more effectively
03:17 - it helps us to find out the room for
03:19 - improvement it can also help in boosting
03:23 - the productivity and sales for a
03:26 - corporation
03:27 - and last one is it helps out to find
03:30 - Trends from digital as already discussed
03:34 - and our last topic is the plot types
03:37 - that we are going to cover in pandas
03:40 - so these are area plots bar plots line
03:44 - plots Scatter Plots box plots hexagonal
03:48 - bin plots kernel density estimation or
03:52 - KDE plots and
03:55 - histograms
03:56 - so these are the plot Heights that we
03:59 - are going to draw in pandas
04:03 - so in today's lecture I introduce you to
04:06 - the concept of data visualization and
04:09 - the plot types that we are going to draw
04:11 - in this course
04:16 - that will be all for today this video is
04:18 - brought to you by programming knowledge
04:20 - please like comment share subscribe and
04:23 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
04:26 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
04:30 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
04:33 - data visualization with pandas in
04:35 - today's lecture I am going to introduce
04:37 - you to the concept of style sheets so
04:41 - let's get started
04:43 - so today's topic is
04:47 - tile sheets
04:51 - so matplotlib has style sheets that you
04:55 - can use to make your plot look a little
04:57 - nicer
04:59 - so style sheets make your plots or
05:03 - charts attractive and appearance
05:08 - so these sheets can include plot B image
05:12 - plot GG plot and a few more other styles
05:16 - that we'll discuss in this lecture
05:21 - so what
05:23 - is a style sheet or how do style sheets
05:26 - work
05:27 - so basically they create a set of style
05:30 - rules that your plots follow
05:32 - they are like fashion influencers like
05:35 - fashion influencers or celebrities
05:38 - create fashion trends that you guys
05:41 - follow in a similar manner
05:44 - stylesheets create a set of style Rules
05:46 - start your plots follow and remember
05:49 - that the main objective of having style
05:52 - sheets is to make your plots look more
05:56 - attractive and
05:58 - nice
05:59 - they give a more professional look to
06:02 - your plots
06:05 - now let's demonstrate with an example so
06:08 - I'm gonna import numpy as NP and import
06:12 - pandas as PD
06:13 - and I'll read a data frame so df1 is
06:17 - equal to PD dot tweet CSV and I'm going
06:20 - to pass
06:22 - df1 and index called
06:25 - is equal to zero I'll display the data
06:29 - frame first so this is our data frame it
06:32 - contains thousands rows and four columns
06:34 - with the name ABC and T
06:37 - now I'm going to create a histogram
06:39 - first so this is the histogram
06:42 - don't worry I'll cover in detail how to
06:45 - create a histogram now let's call the
06:47 - style
06:48 - for that I have to import
06:50 - matplotlab Dot Pi plot as PLT the first
06:56 - oil that we are going to use is GG plot
07:00 - so I'll write PLT dot style dot use and
07:02 - I'll pass ggplot and I'll draw the
07:05 - histogram once again so DF of a DOT is
07:10 - it is ts1 so it is ts1
07:13 - so this is our resultant
07:16 - plot after using the style tgp now let's
07:20 - call another Style
07:23 - so let it be B image this time so I'll
07:26 - write PLT dot style dot use B image
07:30 - and I'll create or I'll draw the
07:32 - histogram once again
07:34 - so this is the resultant histogram after
07:37 - using the style P image now let's call
07:41 - one more Style
07:43 - that is dark background
07:46 - to create darker background in your
07:49 - plots well call the style PhD dot style
07:53 - dot use dark background and I'll draw
07:55 - the histogram one again
08:00 - so it is df1 and not DF so that's why I
08:03 - got an error this is the resultant plot
08:07 - after calling the style dark background
08:10 - now let's call the last Style
08:13 - which is
08:15 - 5 38 so I'll write PLT dot style dot use
08:21 - 5 38.
08:24 - let me just pass it
08:27 - 5 30 8.
08:32 - now I'll draw this program once again so
08:35 - it's TF of a DOT hist
08:38 - sorry it's tf1 I tend to forget it every
08:40 - time so this is the resultant plot after
08:44 - calling the style
08:47 - 5 30 it's
08:50 - so that's all about the style sheets and
08:54 - its application
08:55 - to make your plots look
08:58 - a little nicer and I'll discuss
09:00 - histogram
09:01 - in detail in future video
09:05 - that will be all for today this video is
09:07 - brought to you by programming knowledge

09:19 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
09:22 - data visualization with pandas in
09:25 - today's lecture I'm going to teach you
09:28 - what is an area plot and how can we draw
09:31 - area plots using pandas so let's get
09:34 - started
09:35 - so today's topic is area plot
09:40 - so first of all we are going to draw a
09:43 - stacked area plot
09:45 - so draw a start
09:48 - area
09:50 - plot
09:52 - so what is an area of node an area plot
09:55 - the space quantitative data visually
09:58 - this function wraps the map plot lib
10:01 - area function
10:02 - so in a line plot we just have line but
10:05 - in an area plot we have heated area
10:09 - I'm sure you must have drawn area plots
10:12 - all the time as
10:14 - a teenager in school but now we are
10:18 - going to see how can we draw area plots
10:20 - and visualize Theta using pandas
10:23 - so the Syntax for drawing area plot is
10:26 - data frame
10:28 - Dot Plot dot area and we can specify the
10:33 - x coordinate or the x axis
10:36 - the y-axis
10:39 - and some additional arguments so you can
10:43 - find out more about additional arguments
10:46 - in the documentation of pandas
10:49 - but for now these are enough
10:53 - so I'll demonstrate now
10:57 - first of all I'm going to import pandas
11:00 - as PD and I'll read a CSP file
11:05 - and I'll store it in a variable
11:07 - as a data frame
11:09 - so this is our resultant data frame
11:13 - it has four columns and then rows I'll
11:17 - write df2 Dot Plot dot area to create
11:20 - the plot
11:22 - so we have four colors corresponding to
11:24 - the four columns
11:27 - and also note that
11:30 - the indexes act as the X values here by
11:35 - default and columns take the Y values we
11:39 - can also change them by passing the
11:41 - value of x while calling the method or
11:44 - the function now let's create our own
11:46 - data frame and draw an area plot for it
11:51 - so I'll write DF is equal to p d dot ETA
11:55 - frame and this time I am going to pass a
11:58 - dictionary
11:59 - if you don't know how to create a data
12:01 - frame from a dictionary please refer to
12:04 - our previous course on pandas
12:07 - where I have covered these Topic in
12:09 - detail so I have three
12:12 - Keys here in my dictionary they are
12:14 - sales signups and visits
12:19 - also I have to pass
12:22 - the index
12:23 - after I finish the dictionary so I'll
12:27 - write the index
12:30 - is equal to PD Dot
12:34 - date underscore range
12:37 - and I'll specify the start the end and
12:40 - the frequency
12:42 - so the index in this case is
12:45 - form of date
12:54 - and I'll pass frequency value also
13:01 - so I have created a data frame
13:03 - successfully this is the resulting data
13:06 - frame
13:07 - now
13:10 - I'll write DF Dot Plot dot area
13:13 - and this is the resultant area plot
13:18 - so area plots
13:21 - as that by default and
13:25 - the index values can be changed as per
13:28 - our convenience
13:30 - please take care of these two things the
13:33 - index values can be changed as per our
13:35 - convenience and the area plots are start
13:38 - by default
13:41 - so to produce an unstacked plot we have
13:45 - to pass that is equal to false
13:49 - so I will demonstrate how to draw an
13:52 - unstacked area plot solved by DF Dot
13:55 - Plot dot area and I'll pass the start as
13:57 - false
13:59 - so this is the resultant
14:01 - area plot
14:03 - also note that we can draw
14:05 - an area plot for a single column
14:08 - by passing the Y value
14:11 - as the name of that particular column
14:18 - also we can change the x axis value
14:22 - explicitly
14:24 - for that
14:26 - I'll write DF Dot Plot dot area and I'll
14:29 - specify the x axis
14:31 - so it is giving me an error I think this
14:34 - is because I don't have any column by
14:36 - the name day
14:38 - let me just go back and check once so I
14:42 - have no column by the name day so let me
14:44 - change it to some valid column so let it
14:47 - be
14:48 - sales
14:50 - so this is the resultant
14:53 - area plot
14:56 - in today's lecture
14:59 - I taught you about area plots what are
15:03 - area plots and how to draw area plots
15:06 - using pandas
15:10 - that will be all for today this video is
15:13 - brought to you by programming knowledge
15:15 - please like comment share subscribe and
15:18 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
15:21 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
15:24 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
15:27 - data visualization with pandas today I
15:30 - am going to teach you about bar plots
15:33 - so let's get started
15:36 - so the topic for today is power plot
15:41 - so first question is what is a bar plot
15:43 - a bar plot is a plot that represents
15:46 - categorical data with rectangular bars
15:49 - with lens proportional to the values
15:52 - that they represent I'm sure you have
15:55 - must have drawn bar plots when you were
15:58 - in standard 5 or 6 and they continue
16:02 - till
16:03 - you are in college
16:06 - so bar plot shows comparisons among
16:09 - discrete categories
16:11 - one axis of the plot shows the specific
16:14 - regions being compared and other axis
16:18 - represents the major value
16:21 - now you have an X and A y-axis
16:25 - so the x axis shows the categories you
16:29 - are comparing and the y-axis represents
16:32 - the values that you have measured
16:38 - so this is
16:39 - all about power plots
16:42 - when we refer to the theory
16:50 - so one axis of the plot shows the
16:53 - specific categories being compared and
16:55 - other axis represents a major value
16:58 - so the Syntax for drawing power plot is
17:02 - data frame
17:03 - Dot Plot dot bar
17:08 - you can pass the x value the Y value and
17:12 - some additional arguments
17:16 - I have passed this as none initially but
17:20 - we can pass
17:21 - some column value
17:24 - so x y and some additional arguments
17:26 - that you can find in the documentation
17:28 - of pandas
17:30 - now let's demonstrate
17:33 - so I'll just write import pandas as PD
17:39 - and I'll run this cell
17:41 - and I'll read a data frame
17:44 - so df2 is equal to PD dot read CSV
17:54 - so I'll write df2 in Brackets
17:59 - and I'll run this I'll display the data
18:02 - set or the data frame
18:04 - so it has four columns as shown now in
18:08 - order to draw the actual plot I'll write
18:11 - df2 Dot Plot dot bar
18:15 - and this is the resultant bar plot
18:20 - here we have four colors one color
18:23 - corresponding to each column a b c and d
18:26 - and also we have nine categories
18:31 - corresponding to each index representing
18:35 - the index values 0 to 9.
18:38 - so it takes index as the categorical or
18:43 - the categories
18:46 - so by default this plot is not start
18:50 - to get a stacked version we have to
18:52 - specify
18:54 - start is equal to true
18:59 - so by default it isn't
19:01 - start
19:03 - to get the Stacked version we have to
19:06 - specify
19:09 - start
19:12 - is equal to
19:16 - true
19:19 - I'll draw or I'll plot the Stacked
19:22 - version so I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot
19:26 - bar
19:28 - and I'll pass that is equal to
19:32 - true
19:34 - so this is the Stacked version
19:37 - we don't have different bars
19:40 - we have one bar corresponding to one
19:44 - category
19:45 - so this is the Stacked version and
19:48 - that's all about
19:51 - plots
19:56 - that will be all for today this video is
19:59 - brought to you by programming knowledge

20:10 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
20:13 - data visualization with pandas in
20:16 - today's lecture I'm going to introduce
20:18 - you to the concept of line plots and I
20:21 - am going to demonstrate how can we draw
20:23 - line plots using functions offered by
20:26 - pandas so let's get started
20:30 - so the topic is line plot
20:36 - so line plot is also called as a plot
20:40 - series or data frame as lines
20:44 - these are the alternative names for line
20:48 - plot
20:50 - also called as a plot series or data
20:53 - frame as lines
20:55 - so
20:58 - the line plot function is useful to plot
21:01 - lines using data frames values as
21:04 - coordinates
21:07 - so it's useful to plot lines using
21:10 - data frames
21:12 - values as
21:14 - coordinates
21:21 - now I'll discuss the syntax
21:27 - so the syntax is data frame Dot
21:32 - plot
21:34 - dot line
21:37 - and we can pass the parameters such as
21:40 - the x-axis the y-axis
21:44 - and some additional arguments
21:47 - you can find out more information on
21:50 - these additional arguments in the
21:53 - official pandas documentation
21:57 - let's demonstrate now
22:02 - so first of all
22:05 - we are going to draw line plot
22:08 - for a series
22:12 - to line plot for a
22:15 - series
22:21 - so it makes sense that we have to create
22:23 - a series first so s is equal to PD dot
22:27 - series
22:28 - and I'm going to pass
22:31 - a python list
22:34 - so we have a series now now we can draw
22:37 - a plot using
22:38 - s Dot Plot dot line
22:44 - I forgot to import pandas so let's
22:46 - import pandas
22:49 - so I'm going to write import pandas as
22:52 - PD
22:54 - and then I'll run the cell again so this
22:57 - is the resultant
22:59 - sine plot for the series we have created
23:04 - this is the simplest line plot the line
23:07 - plot for a series now let's draw it for
23:10 - the data frame
23:14 - now we are going to draw a line plot for
23:17 - the Theta frame
23:19 - we need a data frame first let's read it
23:22 - from the CSV file
23:25 - so df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV
23:32 - and we'll pass df1
23:36 - and I'll display the data frame this is
23:39 - the resultant data
23:41 - so it has five columns here now I'll
23:44 - write
23:46 - df1 Dot Plot dot line
23:52 - and I'll pass X is equal to df1 dot
23:55 - index
23:57 - Y is equal to B
24:01 - so we are taking the value of the column
24:03 - B on y-axis and
24:06 - the value of index on the x axis
24:10 - and we are going to take the figure size
24:12 - as
24:13 - 12 comma 3 and we are going to take the
24:16 - line width as 1. these are some
24:18 - additional arguments you can find more
24:21 - about them in the documentation of
24:23 - pandas
24:24 - giving an error
24:27 - so let's see why is it giving an error
24:30 - here
24:31 - I think it's because
24:34 - I have not imported the data frame very
24:38 - well
24:39 - I need to include the index column also
24:43 - when I import a data frame
24:47 - so let me just add it so index column is
24:51 - equal to zero
24:54 - so this is the data frame
24:58 - now let me just correct this thing
25:03 - so
25:05 - let me just
25:07 - make a few changes quickly
25:12 - so let's observe the line plot without
25:15 - any argument so this is the resultant
25:18 - time block now let's change the line
25:20 - width
25:21 - so it becomes a little Messier now let's
25:24 - decrease the line width
25:27 - so this is
25:28 - a very light shaded line plot
25:33 - now let's change the y-axis value
25:36 - because it's difficult to observe a lot
25:38 - of things at once
25:40 - so Y is equal to B so it's giving the
25:44 - line plot only for column B
25:47 - and I've changed the line width now it's
25:49 - a little
25:51 - nicer
25:56 - so this is how we can draw
25:58 - line plot for the data frame
26:08 - that will be all for today this video is

26:22 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
26:25 - data visualization with pandas in
26:28 - today's lecture I'm going to introduce
26:30 - you to the concept of Scatter Plots and
26:34 - I'll demonstrate how to create a scatter
26:36 - plot so let's get started so today's
26:38 - topic is Scatter Plots
26:43 - so our first question is what is a
26:46 - scatter plot so a scatter plot is the
26:49 - type of data visualization technique
26:51 - that shows relationship between two
26:55 - numerical variables in form of
26:58 - dots
27:00 - or spheres because we can't change the
27:04 - size of dots as well so it is a type of
27:07 - data visualization techniques that shows
27:11 - a relationship between two numerical
27:13 - variables
27:15 - for plotting
27:19 - so for plotting to scatter using data
27:23 - frame class there is a member called
27:26 - plot
27:29 - and calling this scatter method on
27:32 - member plot draws a scatter plot
27:35 - if you don't understand what is this you
27:38 - can find more about it in the official
27:41 - documentation of
27:43 - and as
27:47 - so calling the scatter method on the
27:49 - member plot
27:51 - draws a scatter plot so the syntax is
27:56 - data frame Dot Plot dot scatter
27:59 - and you can pass x y
28:04 - values x axis Y axis then the size of
28:09 - the dot and the color of dots
28:12 - these are some of the parameters there
28:14 - are more parameters you can find more
28:17 - about them in the documentation
28:20 - now let's demonstrate how can we draw a
28:23 - scatter plot so I'll import pandas as PD
28:28 - and I'll feed a data frame first
28:32 - so df1 is equal to pd.28 CSV
28:36 - I'll pass the file name and index column
28:39 - as 0. so this is our resultant data
28:43 - frame now I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot
28:46 - scatter I'll pass X as a fires B and
28:51 - this is the resultant scatter plot
28:54 - now we can change the color map of the
28:57 - plot to make it more attractive so for
29:01 - that I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot scatter
29:04 - and I'll pass X is equal to if Y is
29:07 - equal to B these are the column values
29:10 - and pass this color as C and the C math
29:14 - as cool warm
29:17 - so this is the resultant scatter plot
29:22 - also it's important to know that we can
29:25 - change the size of dots to indicate the
29:28 - value of a column
29:31 - so big
29:32 - dot or a biggest sphere will indicate a
29:36 - greater value and a smaller dot will
29:38 - denote a smaller value also note that we
29:42 - have to pass the size as a list and not
29:46 - a scalar so I'll write df1.plot.scatter
29:50 - I'll pass X as a y as p and the size is
29:56 - equal to
29:57 - df1
29:59 - C
30:01 - multiplied by 100.
30:04 - so it gave me an error because oh I have
30:07 - to correct it and change the equal to
30:10 - sign to multiply and small C2 capital c
30:15 - so just hang on a second
30:19 - so I have to change the equal to sign to
30:22 - multiply
30:24 - now I'll run so this is the resultant
30:27 - scatter plot but it's not very
30:29 - attractive right now and it's difficult
30:31 - to read so I'll make a few more changes
30:33 - that is I'll pass the C value as capital
30:37 - c and I'll change the
30:41 - cmap value as well to see map is equal
30:44 - to cool warm
30:47 - let me change the C value as well
30:51 - C is equal to Capital C
30:54 - and
30:55 - cmap is equal to cool warm I'll run this
30:58 - this is the resultant
31:01 - plot or the scatter plot and it's more
31:04 - beautiful
31:06 - that's all about Scatter Plots and how
31:09 - to draw Scatter Plots
31:11 - that will be all for today this video is

31:25 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
31:27 - data visualizations with pandas in
31:30 - today's lecture I'll explain what is a
31:33 - box plot and I'll demonstrate how can we
31:36 - draw box plot using functions offered by
31:39 - pandas so let's get started
31:42 - so today's topic is box plots
31:46 - so what is a box plot a box plot is the
31:50 - visual representation of the depicting
31:53 - groups of numerical data through their
31:56 - quartiles now what are quartiles imagine
32:00 - we have a distribution
32:02 - the median divides it in two parts if we
32:06 - have three
32:08 - such
32:11 - entities which divide
32:13 - the distribution in four equal parts
32:16 - those entities are called as quartiles
32:22 - so box plot is the visual representation
32:24 - of the depicting groups of numerical
32:27 - data through their quartiles
32:29 - box plot is also used for detection of
32:32 - outliers in a data set it captures the
32:36 - summary of the data
32:39 - efficiently with a simple box and
32:42 - whiskers and allows us to compare across
32:45 - groups
32:47 - so another point to note is that box
32:49 - plot is also used for detection of
32:51 - outliers in a data set now what are
32:54 - outliers these are the values which are
32:58 - very far away from the normal data
33:03 - or the general data in that data set
33:05 - there's a lot of difference between
33:08 - these values and the mean or the central
33:12 - location
33:14 - box plots allows us to summarize a
33:17 - sample using the 25th the 50th
33:22 - and 75th percentiles these are also
33:26 - called as lower quartile median and
33:30 - upper quartile please always remember
33:32 - that the 50th percentile
33:36 - the median and the entity which divides
33:39 - the distribution in two equal parts is
33:42 - median
33:45 - we'll study more about box plot
33:49 - and quartiles in statistics and we'll
33:52 - also see how can we calculate quartiles
33:56 - for a given distribution
33:59 - so more about box plot
34:03 - and
34:04 - quartiles and future videos on
34:07 - statistics or statistics for
34:10 - data science
34:13 - now it's important to know that a box
34:15 - plot consists of five important
34:19 - things or
34:21 - entities
34:25 - so let me just change it to
34:28 - Colin
34:30 - yeah now the first one is the minimum
34:33 - value
34:35 - the second is the first quartile or the
34:38 - lower quartile
34:43 - the third one is the median
34:46 - the median divides the distribution into
34:48 - two equal parts
34:49 - the fourth one is the third quartile or
34:53 - the upper quartile and the last one is
34:56 - the maximum value
34:58 - now let's demonstrate how can we
35:01 - actually draw a box plot so I'll import
35:05 - pandas as PD
35:14 - then I'll
35:17 - read a CSV file and extract a data frame
35:21 - from the file so DF is equal to
35:25 - read CSV df2 so it's p d dot rate CSV so
35:29 - just correct it DF is equal to PD dot
35:33 - read CSP now this is R data frame
35:37 - now I have to write
35:39 - DF Dot Plot dot box
35:46 - and I'll run this cell
35:54 - so it's giving an error it's D it's not
35:57 - df2 so this is the resultant box plot
36:00 - please note that this green line in the
36:03 - center denotes
36:05 - the median
36:08 - so this is the simple box plot
36:14 - here you can see that
36:16 - this portion
36:17 - this portion this portion and this
36:20 - portion contains 25 percent
36:24 - each
36:26 - so this total is hundred percent if it
36:29 - had any outlier
36:31 - it would be outside the box or the
36:34 - whiskers
36:37 - we can also enable
36:39 - grids and
36:41 - add
36:43 - other
36:44 - parameters
36:46 - so if I want to enable the grid I have
36:49 - to write
36:51 - DF Dot Plot dot box grid is equal to
36:54 - true
36:56 - so for more details please check the
36:59 - documentation
37:00 - you will get a lot of things if you
37:02 - refer the documentation let me draw the
37:05 - grid version so I'll specify grid is
37:08 - equal to true so this is the version
37:12 - with grid so in today's lecture I
37:15 - covered the box plots
37:17 - that will be all for today this video is
37:20 - brought to you by programming knowledge
37:22 - please like comment share subscribe and

37:31 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
37:34 - data visualization using pandas in
37:37 - today's lecture I'm going to explain you
37:39 - what is a hexagonal pin plot and I'm
37:43 - also going to demonstrate how to draw
37:46 - one using pandas so let's get started
37:50 - so our topic is hexagonal bin plots
37:54 - in a hexagonal bin plot a
37:57 - two-dimensional lattice is divided into
37:59 - number of hexagonal quids or size n
38:02 - cross M based on the number of data
38:06 - points of the distribution of two
38:08 - variables X and Y that fall under any
38:11 - hexagon the hexagons are given a color
38:16 - so
38:17 - a hexagonal bin plot consists of a lot
38:20 - of small hexagons
38:23 - and on one side we have an x-axis and on
38:28 - the other side we have a y-axis and
38:32 - these hexagons are given colors
38:34 - depending on the values of these
38:37 - variables that are X and Y
38:40 - hexagonal bin plots are generally used
38:42 - when the data is very large or we can
38:46 - say that it is really very helpful when
38:49 - the number of points in the distribution
38:51 - is very very large
38:54 - so you just need to remember that there
38:58 - will be a lattice which will be divided
39:00 - into smaller hexagonal grids and there
39:03 - will be two variables X and Y and
39:06 - smaller hexagonal grids will be given a
39:09 - color depending on the value of X and Y
39:12 - also note that it is used when number of
39:15 - points and the distribution is very
39:18 - large now let's demonstrate
39:20 - this time we'll create a new data frame
39:23 - because we need a data frame with a lot
39:25 - of points and
39:27 - the previous data frames were not large
39:30 - enough
39:34 - so this time I'm going to use
39:37 - the ram n method of numpy to create a
39:40 - data frame
39:42 - so data frame is equal to PD dot data
39:45 - frame
39:46 - and I'll pass NP Dot
39:50 - random
39:56 - so NP dot random dot Rand n and let the
39:59 - size be 1000 comma 2
40:02 - and the column names Be A and B now I'll
40:06 - run this
40:07 - just hang on a second
40:09 - so I'll run this
40:10 - so this is giving me an error because I
40:13 - have not imported
40:14 - numpy
40:16 - now let me run this again and this is
40:19 - the resultant data frame
40:21 - now we have created the data frame
40:28 - let's plot now
40:30 - so to plot I'll write DF Dot Plot Dot X
40:35 - bin
40:39 - and I'll pass the value of X and Y
40:43 - sorry it's
40:45 - Y and B in inverted commas
40:48 - yeah so this is the resultant
40:51 - hexagonal pin plot it's not
40:54 - very
40:55 - clear I'm not able to derive any
40:59 - information from this plot so I'll
41:00 - customize it a little bit
41:04 - so I'll write
41:06 - df.plot.x bin and I'll pass the value of
41:09 - x and y and I'll change the grid size to
41:12 - 25 and the color map
41:15 - to cool warm
41:20 - now it's a little more clear
41:23 - than the previous one
41:25 - you can derive the information from
41:28 - these hexagonal grids more easily
41:34 - now let's try to customize it a little
41:36 - bit more
41:39 - so
41:41 - that's a mistake I need to change it to
41:43 - Capital so this is
41:46 - another customization for a better
41:48 - experience
41:50 - so that's all about
41:52 - hexagonal bin plots
41:54 - in pandas
41:57 - we'll study about it more in statistics
42:00 - that will be all for today this video is

42:14 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
42:17 - data visualization with pandas in this
42:20 - lecture I'm going to teach you about KDE
42:23 - plot and density plots and I'll also
42:27 - demonstrate how to draw these so let's
42:30 - get started
42:31 - so today's topic is KDE plots
42:34 - so in statistics
42:36 - kernel density estimation
42:39 - or KDE is a non-parametric way to
42:43 - estimate the probability density of
42:46 - function or PDF of a random variable
42:51 - so
42:52 - in short
42:54 - the KDE plot or the kernel density
42:57 - estimation plot gives us the idea about
43:00 - the probability density function or PDF
43:04 - of a random variable
43:07 - this function will use gaussian kernels
43:10 - and include automatic bandwidth
43:12 - estimation or determination
43:15 - we'll study about all these in
43:18 - statistics in details but remember that
43:21 - the KDE plot gives us an idea of the PDF
43:26 - of a random variable and this function
43:30 - will use causing kernels and include
43:33 - automatic bandwidth estimation
43:37 - Flash
43:39 - determination
43:44 - so more about PDF
43:47 - random variables and gaussian kernels in
43:52 - statistics
43:57 - statistics is very interesting branch of
44:00 - mathematics
44:02 - which intersects with data science
44:06 - now the Syntax for
44:08 - KD plots is
44:11 - data frame Dot Plot
44:14 - dot KDE and we can pass the parameters
44:17 - like bandwidth method
44:21 - IND and some
44:25 - additional arguments
44:29 - so you can pass these parameters or not
44:32 - they are optional
44:36 - so these are bandwidth method IND and
44:39 - some additional arguments you can find
44:42 - more about them in the documentation of
44:45 - pandas
44:46 - so all these parameters are optional now
44:50 - let's demonstrate how to draw a KDE plot
44:54 - so first of all I'll import
44:57 - pandas as PD
45:01 - then I'll read a CSV file and I'll
45:05 - extract the data frame from the file
45:07 - so df2 is equal to PD dot read CSV and
45:12 - I'll pass df2
45:15 - now I am going to draw the plot
45:20 - wait a second it's the F2 of a Dot Plot
45:24 - dot KDE
45:27 - and here it is so this is the KDE plot
45:32 - now we can also analyze multiple columns
45:36 - at once this is for the column A only
45:39 - so we can also
45:41 - analyze multiple columns at once
45:46 - so for that we'll use a density plot
45:50 - instead of a KDE plot so I'll write df2
45:55 - Dot Plot
45:57 - Dot
45:59 - density
46:02 - and I'll close the bracket and I'll run
46:04 - it
46:06 - so this is the KDE plot and this is the
46:09 - density plot
46:12 - so in today's lecture
46:14 - I taught you the KDE plot and the
46:17 - density plot and I also demonstrated how
46:21 - to draw these plots
46:23 - so that's all about KDE and density
46:27 - plots
46:29 - that will be all for today this video is
46:32 - brought to you by programming knowledge

46:43 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
46:46 - data visualization with pandas in
46:48 - today's lecture I'm going to teach you
46:50 - how to draw histograms with pandas so
46:55 - let's get started
46:57 - so the topic is histo grams
47:01 - so histograms are a way of representing
47:04 - the distribution of T down
47:07 - in other words histograms depict
47:09 - Hardware distributions shape look like
47:12 - when viewed with the help of a
47:16 - graph
47:17 - so a histogram is made up of bars which
47:20 - each bar representing a certain data
47:23 - values
47:24 - the height of the bar indicates how many
47:27 - data points fall within that range
47:31 - so
47:33 - what is the difference between histogram
47:36 - and a bar plot is a histogram is
47:39 - somewhat continuous
47:41 - it's not continuous on the y-axis but
47:43 - it's continuous on the x-axis while a
47:47 - bar plot is discrete on the x-axis as
47:51 - well as the y-axis
47:54 - so histograms can be used to compare two
47:57 - data sets or to observe how distribution
48:00 - of data changes over time
48:04 - we can draw histograms
48:07 - to see what is the type of our
48:10 - distribution for example is it normal or
48:13 - binomial or anything
48:15 - so it helps us to
48:18 - doubt conclusions
48:20 - we apply the histogram method on
48:24 - individual series of a data frame
48:28 - let's plot now
48:33 - so first of all I'm going to import
48:34 - pandas as PD
48:37 - and then I'm going to read a data frame
48:41 - so let it be df1 is equal to PD dot read
48:45 - CSV
48:56 - so it should be read CSV I made a small
48:59 - mistake so please take care because I
49:02 - wanted to create a data frame so I
49:03 - directly wrote a data frame but it's
49:06 - read underscore
49:08 - CSV
49:10 - now let me display the data frame so
49:12 - this is our data frame now to draw a
49:16 - histogram I'll write
49:18 - df1 and in square bracket the column
49:20 - name
49:22 - Dot Plot
49:25 - Dot
49:26 - paste and brackets close so this is our
49:30 - resultant histogram
49:33 - on x-axis we can see
49:36 - the values are on the y axis we can see
49:39 - the frequency
49:42 - for details
49:44 - or for a more final view we can increase
49:47 - the number of pins
49:52 - so let me just increase the pins
49:55 - to 70.
49:57 - so let the bins be 70. so now
50:01 - you can see the histograms in much more
50:03 - fine detail so it's kind of a normal
50:07 - distribution If You observe it carefully
50:09 - it's not a proper but it's sort of a
50:12 - normal distribution
50:14 - a normal distribution is better visible
50:16 - with the KDE plot because it's a
50:20 - continuous distribution
50:22 - now let's see how to observe multiple
50:25 - columns at once
50:27 - so for that
50:29 - we have to write
50:32 - df1 Dot Plot dot hist
50:36 - this time we are not passing
50:39 - or not applying it on a series file on
50:43 - the whole data field so in this case it
50:47 - is Tagged so it's not clearly visible
50:49 - now I have an assignment for you you
50:52 - have to observe multiple columns at once
50:55 - but not in the same chart you have to
50:59 - come up with the method of plotting
51:02 - different
51:04 - charts for each column so you can
51:07 - observe it more carefully
51:10 - that's all about histograms that will be
51:14 - all for today this video is brought to

51:27 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
51:29 - data visualization with pandas in
51:32 - today's lecture we are going to discuss
51:34 - the problem statement of our data
51:37 - visualization project so let's get
51:40 - started so first of all we are going to
51:42 - take a look at the project objectives
51:45 - so the project title or the project
51:48 - topic is data visualization with pandas
51:51 - the first objectives of the project is
51:54 - Introduction to data analysis the second
51:58 - one is demonstration of the concept of
52:01 - style sheets the third one is regarding
52:04 - the different kind of plot with pandas
52:08 - and Port one is regarding the
52:11 - modification of plots
52:13 - to create more defined and beautiful or
52:17 - professional plots
52:19 - our project has been divided into six
52:22 - parts or six tasks
52:25 - now we are going to discuss every one of
52:28 - them in detail so let's move on
52:32 - so our first task
52:34 - read the data frames df1 df2 and df3 and
52:39 - analyze them with the help of pandas
52:41 - function
52:42 - also note that these data frames can be
52:46 - found at the GitHub repository provided
52:49 - along with this course
52:53 - the second task is read the CSV file
52:57 - name df1 that is data frame one and pass
53:01 - the column 0 at the index while reading
53:05 - for column B drop a histogram and use
53:08 - different styles to improve the
53:10 - appearance of your plot so this sub task
53:15 - or this task is regarding
53:18 - style sheets
53:20 - now moving to the next task read the CSV
53:24 - file name df3 or data frame 3 draw a
53:28 - scatter plot past x value as column A Y
53:32 - value as column b c value as read its
53:37 - value as 50 and figure size as 12 comma
53:41 - 3. also draw a histogram for column e of
53:45 - the data frame use the parameters as
53:49 - Alpha value as 0.5 and bins is equal to
53:53 - 25.
53:55 - now moving on to the next task
53:59 - info task we have to draw two plot first
54:04 - of all to our box plot comparing columns
54:06 - A and B of the data frame tf3 and the
54:10 - second one is draw a KDE plot of the
54:14 - column D of df3
54:16 - the fifth task is draw a density plot
54:20 - for data frame 3 or df3 and figure out
54:24 - how to change line width and make the
54:27 - line style Dash this is something that
54:30 - is like providing a makeover to your
54:33 - plot
54:35 - beautifying the plot can help us figure
54:39 - out
54:40 - patterns from the plot a little faster
54:44 - and it looks good as well
54:48 - so our last
54:49 - task or the six tasks is create an area
54:54 - plot for all the columns for just the
54:57 - rows up to 30 for the data frame df3 so
55:01 - we have to include only the rows up to
55:06 - 30 and we have to include all the
55:09 - necessary columns also we need to figure
55:12 - out a way to display the legend outside
55:14 - of the box that's all about problem
55:17 - statement project objectives and
55:20 - description of tasks
55:23 - that will be all for today this video is
55:26 - brought to you by programming knowledge
55:28 - please like comment share subscribe and
55:31 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
55:34 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
55:37 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
55:40 - data visualization with pandas today we
55:43 - are going to solve the Task 1 of our
55:46 - project so let's get started
55:49 - so our first task is read the data
55:52 - frames df1 TF2 and df3 and analyze them
55:57 - with the help of pandas function also
55:59 - link to these can be found at the GitHub
56:02 - repository provided along with this code
56:05 - so our first job is reading the data
56:09 - frames
56:11 - so the title is reading the data frames
56:17 - now we are going to import pandas as PD
56:23 - so import pandas as PD
56:26 - and then we are going to read the data
56:29 - fix
56:30 - so df1 is equal to PD dot read
56:34 - CSV
56:38 - and I'm going to pass df1
56:42 - and
56:43 - index as the First Column so index is
56:47 - called is equal to 0.
56:51 - similarly df2 is equal to PD Dot vcsc
56:57 - and I'm going to pass TF2
57:00 - and df3 is equal to PD dot read CSV and
57:06 - I am going to pass the df3
57:12 - now
57:13 - I am going to display the data operates
57:17 - so displaying the data frames
57:23 - so this is the first data frame it has
57:26 - four columns capital e b c and d so it
57:30 - has thousand rows and four columns the
57:33 - second data frame has four columns ABCD
57:37 - and 10 entries or rows and the third
57:40 - data frame also has four columns ABCD
57:44 - and 500 rows
57:47 - now let's
57:51 - see the description so they have one dot
57:54 - describe so this is the description of
57:57 - the first data set so the count is
57:59 - thousand and you can see the mean
58:02 - the minimum the maximum and the quartile
58:05 - distribution
58:07 - similarly we can analyze the second data
58:11 - set as well as the third data set so
58:15 - this is the description of the second
58:17 - data set
58:20 - now let's
58:22 - describe the third data set so df3 dot
58:26 - describe
58:30 - so this is the description of
58:33 - the third data set
58:36 - now we'll try to extract some
58:40 - information
58:41 - so we'll use the info method so this is
58:44 - the information on First Data set so it
58:48 - has 1000 entries and four columns and
58:51 - all are not null similarly we can
58:54 - analyze the second data set
58:56 - as well as
58:59 - the third data set
59:02 - so this is the information regarding the
59:05 - second act third data set respectively
59:08 - now let's
59:10 - fetch all the key values or the column
59:13 - names so we use the keys method
59:18 - so
59:19 - all the data sets have four keys so a b
59:23 - c d only the difference is the capital
59:26 - and small
59:28 - letter notations
59:33 - so we use the keys method to fetch all
59:36 - the column names
59:38 - now let's analyze the correlation among
59:42 - all the columns in different data sets
59:45 - so our next
59:48 - objective is to analyze the correlation
59:54 - so correlation analysis I'll use the
59:57 - core method so this one dot core
60:01 - so this is the correlation among the
60:03 - four Columns of first data set similarly
60:07 - I can analyze the correlation and second
60:09 - data set as well as the third data set
60:17 - so this is the correlation in
60:20 - third data set so we have successfully
60:24 - read
60:25 - and analyze
60:28 - all the
60:30 - data sets
60:34 - that will be all for today this video is
60:36 - brought to you by programming knowledge
60:38 - please like comment share subscribe and
60:41 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
60:44 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
60:48 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
60:50 - data visualization with pandas today we
60:53 - are going to solve the second task of
60:56 - our project so let's get started
61:00 - so our second task is read the CSV file
61:05 - name tf1 that is data frame 1 and pass
61:09 - the column 0 as the index while reading
61:12 - it
61:13 - for column B draw a histogram and use
61:17 - different styles to improve the
61:19 - appearance of your plot so these are the
61:23 - two sub tasks under the tasks 2.
61:27 - so now let's solve so this is the second
61:30 - task
61:31 - first of all I am going to import pandas
61:34 - as PD
61:39 - so import pandas as PD and now I'll
61:43 - proceed to read
61:45 - the data free
61:48 - so I have to write
61:49 - data frame name or the F3 is equal to PD
61:53 - dot feed underscore CSV and I have to
61:56 - pass tf1
61:58 - and I have to pass index column or index
62:02 - underscore call is equal to 0.
62:06 - so I pass
62:08 - column 0 as the index
62:12 - so I've passed column 0 as index now
62:17 - let's draw histograms and use different
62:19 - styles
62:23 - so we have completed the first sub tasks
62:27 - and now we have to complete the signal
62:29 - task
62:31 - now let's talk histograms and use
62:33 - different styles
62:36 - so I'll write
62:38 - df1
62:40 - B dot hist
62:47 - so this is giving me an error let me
62:51 - just figure out why it's giving me an
62:53 - error
62:54 - so this is probably because the column
62:57 - name is capital
62:59 - so I'll change it and this is the
63:02 - histogram
63:04 - now let's use different styles
63:09 - so using styles
63:11 - so for that we have to do an import
63:15 - so we have to import matplotlib dot Pi
63:18 - plot as PLT
63:22 - and we have to write an extra command
63:26 - that is PLT dot style dot use
63:34 - and first of all I'll pass
63:37 - GG plot
63:41 - so this is the resultant histogram after
63:44 - the use of style GG plot
63:47 - now let me just change it to
63:52 - bmh
63:54 - and I'll display the histogram once
63:57 - again
63:58 - so this is the resultant histogram after
64:01 - using the style B image
64:04 - now we'll use dark background so I'll
64:07 - write in the
64:09 - bracket dark underscore background
64:14 - and I'll display
64:16 - the histogram once again
64:19 - so this is the resultant histogram after
64:22 - using the style dark background
64:25 - now let's move on to our last style that
64:30 - is 5 38.
64:34 - so I'll use the style 530 eat so this is
64:38 - the resultant
64:41 - plot after using the style 538
64:46 - so my personal favorite is
64:50 - GG plot
64:53 - because it gives a unique appearance to
64:56 - a plot
64:58 - so my personal favorite is ggplot yours
65:01 - can be dark background or bmh or 538 or
65:05 - many more you can pick your favorite but
65:08 - mine is GG plot
65:11 - so we have completed our second task of
65:15 - the project
65:16 - that will be all for today this video is
65:19 - brought to you by programming knowledge
65:21 - please like comment share subscribe and
65:24 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
65:27 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
65:30 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
65:33 - data visualization with pandas today we
65:36 - are going to solve the third task of our
65:39 - project so let's get started
65:43 - so the third task is read the CSV file
65:47 - name gf3 that is data frame 3. draw a
65:52 - scatter plot pass the x value as column
65:55 - A Y value as column b c value as read s
66:00 - value as 50 and figure size as 12 comma
66:05 - 3. also draw a histogram for column A of
66:10 - the data frame and use the parameters as
66:14 - Alpha value
66:16 - of 0.5 and number of bins is equal to
66:21 - 25.
66:22 - now let's solve this
66:26 - so first of all let me just
66:29 - write the heading task 3 and let me
66:34 - import
66:36 - so let me import pandas as PD
66:43 - so my first job is to read the data
66:46 - frame
66:47 - so df3 is equal to PD dot read
66:51 - underscore CSV
66:54 - and I'll pass data frame 3.
66:58 - also let me just print the first five
67:01 - entries of the data set
67:05 - now we have to draw a scatter plot so
67:08 - for that I'll write TS3 Dot Plot dot
67:12 - scatter
67:15 - and I'll pass the x value as a
67:20 - y value as B
67:24 - s is equal to 50 and
67:27 - fixed size of the figure size as
67:31 - 12 comma 3
67:34 - and I'll
67:36 - just run the cell so this is our scatter
67:39 - plot
67:41 - now let me change
67:42 - the color
67:45 - by specifying the C value as straight
67:49 - so this is the resultant plot now we are
67:52 - going to change the color
67:58 - now let's change the color
68:01 - for that I'll just copy and paste the
68:04 - command
68:07 - and I'll add an extra parameter that is
68:10 - C
68:12 - is equal to data
68:16 - I'll run this cell and this is the
68:19 - resultant
68:20 - plot
68:22 - so our second sub task is to create a
68:24 - histogram
68:26 - so for that I'll write
68:30 - the command
68:32 - to create a histogram
68:34 - that is df3
68:40 - square bracket a because we are drawing
68:43 - a histogram concerning the column e
68:46 - so df3 e Dot Plot
68:49 - dot hist
68:51 - so this is our histogram
68:54 - knowledge
68:58 - change the
69:01 - Alpha value and the number of pins
69:07 - so this type is GG plot because I like
69:10 - it
69:11 - or I'll just change some parameters
69:16 - so I'll write df3 e
69:20 - Dot Plot dot hist
69:24 - Alpha
69:27 - is equal to 0.5 and
69:30 - bins
69:32 - equal to 25.
69:35 - so this is the resultant histogram
69:39 - so it is a little transparent and has
69:42 - number of pins as 25.
69:45 - so we have successfully
69:47 - salt are
69:49 - third task
69:51 - that's all for task
69:54 - 3.
69:55 - that will be all for today this video is
69:58 - brought to you by programming knowledge
70:00 - please like comment share subscribe and
70:03 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
70:06 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
70:10 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
70:12 - data visualization with pandas in
70:16 - today's lecture we are going to solve
70:18 - the fourth dark of our project so let's
70:23 - get started
70:25 - so the task for is draw a box plot
70:30 - comparing columns A and B of the data
70:33 - frame df3 and also draw a KDE or kernel
70:39 - density estimation plot of the column D
70:43 - of the data frame
70:45 - now let's move on to the solution
70:48 - so the heading errors task 4.
70:54 - and the first sub task is draw a box
70:58 - plot
71:00 - so draw a box plot
71:05 - and compare the columns a
71:09 - so compare the columns A and B
71:16 - so I'm going to import pandas as PD
71:22 - and I'm going to read the data frame
71:24 - first
71:25 - so I'll write
71:28 - reading the data frame
71:30 - first
71:32 - and
71:34 - the command is tf3
71:37 - is equal to PD dot read CSV and in the
71:43 - bracket I'll pass df3
71:46 - I'll display the data frame
71:48 - so this is the resultant data frame
71:54 - so this is the
71:55 - data frame
71:59 - so first of all we'll draw a box plot
72:04 - for that I'll write df3
72:09 - let me just
72:11 - write
72:12 - so df3
72:17 - and square bracket I'll pass
72:21 - a list
72:23 - so it's
72:25 - it's like a list inside a list
72:28 - so in
72:29 - square bracket I have passed the list
72:32 - containing the elements A and B and I'll
72:35 - write Dot Plot dot box so this is the
72:39 - resultant box plot comparing the columns
72:42 - A and B you can't see the quartile
72:45 - distribution
72:46 - for both columns A and B
72:51 - so the
72:53 - quartile distribution seems to be
72:55 - different
72:57 - on the position of quartiles is also
73:00 - different
73:01 - so the quartile distribution of columns
73:04 - A and B
73:09 - is different as shown
73:17 - now let's move on to our second subtask
73:20 - dot s k d e plot
73:25 - or second sub task is
73:29 - regarding KDE plot so the target column
73:33 - for it is
73:35 - d
73:38 - so we are using small notation so it's
73:41 - small
73:42 - now I'll write df3
73:45 - D Dot Plot
73:48 - dot KDE
73:54 - so this is the resultant
73:56 - KDE plot
74:04 - so this is the resultant KDE plot
74:08 - so we have completed our fourth task as
74:13 - well
74:17 - so task 4 has been completed that will
74:20 - be all for today this video is brought
74:22 - to you by programming knowledge please
74:24 - like comment share subscribe and hit the
74:27 - Bell button for updates and stay tuned
74:30 - with us for next lecture thank you
74:33 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
74:36 - data visualization with pandas today we
74:40 - are going to solve the first task of our
74:43 - project
74:45 - so let's get started
74:47 - so the fifth task is draw a density plot
74:52 - for data frame 3 or tf3 and figure out
74:56 - how to change the line width and make
74:59 - the line style Dash
75:01 - now let's move on to the solution
75:06 - so this is task
75:11 - 5.
75:14 - so first of all I am going to read the
75:17 - data frame
75:19 - So reading the data frame
75:22 - so I'm going to import pandas as PD
75:30 - and then I'll write
75:32 - df3
75:35 - is equal to PD dot read
75:40 - underscore CSV
75:43 - and I'll pass df3
75:46 - I'll print the data frame
75:49 - so this is the resultant data frame
75:52 - now we are going to draw a density plot
75:57 - so for that I'll write tf3 Dot Plot
76:02 - dot density
76:06 - so let's draw a density plot first
76:10 - and the syntax is data frame name Dot
76:14 - Plot dot density so df3 Dot Plot dot
76:18 - density
76:20 - and I'll run this cell
76:22 - so this is the resultant density plot
76:27 - also note that
76:30 - a density plot
76:32 - provides a comparison of all the columns
76:37 - so we can analyze all the columns in a
76:40 - single plot
76:45 - so this is the density plot for all the
76:47 - columns
76:49 - now let's draw the density plot for a
76:53 - particular column and let that column be
76:56 - column e
76:58 - so I'll divide tf3
77:01 - of a Dot Plot
77:05 - dot density
77:07 - so my keyboard must avoid that is
77:12 - plot
77:14 - so this is the resultant
77:17 - density plot for column e
77:20 - also note that a density plot for a
77:24 - single column will be same as the KDE
77:28 - plot
77:30 - let's see
77:32 - by drawing a KDE plot as well you can
77:36 - see that the shape
77:38 - and
77:40 - the structure is
77:42 - same
77:45 - so both of them are same
77:48 - now let's figure out how to change the
77:51 - line width and line Style
77:55 - so we have to change the line width and
77:59 - time Style
78:02 - for that I'll write df3 Dot Plot Dot
78:08 - density
78:10 - and I'll pass the line width or LW as 5
78:14 - and line style as Dash or LS is equal to
78:19 - Dash Dash
78:22 - so this is the resultant
78:24 - density plot after changing the line
78:26 - width and line style this is not very
78:29 - attractive
78:31 - or clear
78:32 - so let's analyze for one column only so
78:36 - I'll write df3
78:39 - square bracket a Dot Plot dot density
78:42 - and I'll pass the line width as 5 and
78:46 - Einstein as dashed
78:50 - so this is the resultant plot
78:53 - so we have solved
78:55 - the fifth task as well
79:00 - that will be all for today this video is
79:02 - brought to you by programming knowledge
79:04 - please like comment share subscribe and
79:07 - hit the Bell button for updates and stay
79:10 - tuned with us for next lecture thank you
79:14 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
79:16 - data visualization with pandas today we
79:19 - are going to solve the sixth and the
79:22 - last task of our project
79:25 - so let's get started
79:28 - so our sixth task is create an area plot
79:32 - for all the columns for just the rows up
79:35 - to 30 for the data frame 3 and also
79:38 - figure out a way to display the legend
79:42 - outside of the box
79:44 - so we have to create an area plot for
79:46 - all the columns but up to 30th root only
79:51 - and we have to figure out a way to
79:54 - display the legend outside of the box
79:57 - now let's move on to the solution
80:00 - so let me just give the heading task
80:04 - 6. now I am going to import pandas as PD
80:11 - so import
80:13 - ant and small
80:14 - so import pandas as PD
80:18 - and then I'm going to read the data
80:21 - frame
80:23 - So reading the data frame
80:27 - so df3 is equal to PD dot read
80:31 - underscore CSV
80:33 - and I have to pass the data frame name
80:36 - as tf3
80:38 - now I'm going to display the data frame
80:40 - so this is the data frame
80:47 - now our first task is to create an area
80:51 - plot
80:54 - so I need to write df3
80:58 - Dot Plot
81:01 - dot area
81:06 - so this is the resultant area plot it
81:09 - covers all the four columns and all the
81:13 - rows
81:15 - so we need to make some changes
81:19 - so now we need to personalize
81:24 - or we can say that we require some
81:27 - personalization
81:33 - so we are going to draw an area plot
81:36 - only for the first 30 rows
81:43 - so there are two methods
81:46 - first is use of dot IX and the second
81:50 - one is the use of
81:52 - iloc method
81:55 - knowledge demonstrate
81:57 - so I have to write df3 Dot
82:00 - IX
82:01 - and I have to pass the slice 0
82:04 - colon 30 and I'll write Dot Plot dot
82:08 - area
82:11 - I'll run this cell
82:13 - so this is giving me an error
82:19 - so let me just change it to iloc
82:23 - so if you are getting an error with DOT
82:26 - IX method you can use dot iloc method as
82:31 - discussed in the pandas module
82:35 - so I'll changed dot IX 2 dot i l o c
82:41 - just hang on for a second
82:45 - so I'll change it to dot i
82:50 - l o c
82:52 - I'll run this cell once again
82:56 - so this time I didn't get any error
83:02 - so I'll change it to dot i
83:06 - Loc
83:08 - so you can use either one I got an error
83:11 - so I use dot i l o c
83:15 - now let's change the alpha value
83:18 - that is make the
83:21 - plot a little more transparent for that
83:25 - I have to introduce one more parameter
83:28 - that is Alpha is equal to
83:31 - 0.4 so this is the resultant
83:35 - area
83:38 - now I need to figure out a way to
83:42 - display the legend outside the box
83:46 - so display the legend outside the box
83:50 - so I'll write
83:52 - so this is the legend and I need to
83:55 - display it outside the box
83:57 - so I'll write f is equal to PLT dot
84:00 - figure
84:02 - then I'll write df3
84:04 - Dot iloc
84:08 - I'll pass the slice
84:11 - I'll write Dot Plot dot area
84:17 - and I'll pass Alpha is equal to 0.4 and
84:23 - e x
84:25 - is equal to F dot GCA
84:31 - you can also refer stack overflow
84:35 - to figure out how to display the legend
84:38 - outside the box
84:39 - and you can also use this method
84:42 - I'll write PLT dot Legend
84:47 - and I'll pass loc is equal to
84:51 - Center left
84:54 - so loc is equal to Center left
84:59 - and B box to Anchor
85:04 - B box to Anchor
85:07 - is equal to
85:11 - 1
85:13 - .0 comma 0.5
85:17 - and I'll write PLT dot show
85:26 - [Music]
85:29 - so I got an empty
85:32 - graph this time because I need to write
85:35 - all of this together
85:38 - so please take care of this thing
85:42 - so I'll write everything in one cell
85:45 - I'll run it and this is the resultant
85:49 - area plot where the legend is displayed
85:52 - outside the box
85:55 - now we have completed
85:57 - the task six
85:59 - successfully
86:02 - that will be all for today this video is

86:16 - hi guys welcome back to our course on
86:19 - data visualization with pandas in
86:22 - today's lecture I'm going to give you an
86:24 - overview to KK so let's get started
86:29 - Eagle is on online community of data
86:33 - scientists and machine learning
86:34 - practitioners it offers a no setup
86:38 - customizable jupyter notebook
86:41 - environment it provides access to gpus
86:45 - at no cost it allows users to
86:49 - collaborate with others find and publish
86:52 - data set the main use of Kegel is for
86:57 - analyzing and downloading data sets and
87:01 - we can even collaborate with others now
87:04 - let me just show you the website
87:07 - that is
87:11 - so it's www.kill.com
87:16 - here you can see that
87:18 - there are three mean
87:20 - sections of this website the first one
87:24 - is regarding the competitions second one
87:27 - is the short term courses and third one
87:30 - is regarding the data and code
87:34 - so first of all let's take a look at the
87:37 - competitions
87:42 - so these are some of the competitions
87:44 - the first one is regarding the Titanic
87:48 - disaster and it's a machine learning
87:51 - problem and we have to predict the
87:53 - survival and second one is regarding the
87:56 - housing prices
87:57 - and the third one is the spaceship
88:01 - so we have different levels here
88:04 - so there are different levels of
88:06 - difficulty
88:08 - let me just move back to the home
88:12 - and there are different types of
88:16 - problems for beginners
88:18 - intermediate and advanced
88:22 - let's move on to the second section that
88:25 - is short term courses
88:27 - here we have
88:29 - courses for beginner interpretiate as
88:32 - well as advanced level
88:34 - for in beginners we have intro to
88:36 - programming Python and intro to machine
88:39 - learning
88:41 - in intermediate we have intro to deep
88:43 - learning intermediate machine learning
88:46 - and pandas
88:48 - Anon Advanced we have time series
88:51 - feature engineering and computer vision
88:56 - now let's move on to the third section
88:59 - of this website which is
89:03 - browsing inspiring data and code
89:07 - so we can explore code of other people
89:09 - as well as we can explore the data set
89:13 - so here I can export the code
89:16 - for example I open this hurt attack
89:19 - analysis
89:20 - prediction
89:22 - so I can
89:25 - access the code written by other people
89:27 - so this is the code and these are the
89:31 - different sections of the notebook
89:35 - so this is the exploratory data analysis
89:38 - generally people document their code
89:41 - very well on cable so this is one of the
89:45 - notebook so we can't see
89:48 - the box plots here and this person has
89:54 - used machine learning model that is
89:57 - logistic regression for
89:59 - prediction so we this is training the
90:03 - model then we have evaluation we'll
90:06 - discuss all of it in detail when we'll
90:09 - cover machine learning
90:11 - and other portions
90:15 - so this is all about analysis
90:21 - so hard attack analysis prediction
90:24 - now let me just move on to the data sets
90:27 - so we have different data sets available
90:29 - here
90:31 - so like Instagram YouTube videos
90:35 - then dislike YouTube videos yoga so
90:39 - there are all varieties of data sets
90:42 - available on Google
90:44 - and the most interesting part is the
90:47 - competitions
90:49 - we can even host a competition here so
90:52 - let's take a look at the Active
90:54 - competitions
90:56 - so this is
90:58 - the first one that is first and future
91:01 - pair contact detection so there are 275
91:06 - teams competing in this competition and
91:09 - the reward is hundred thousand dollars
91:12 - similarly there are different
91:14 - competitions that
91:16 - you can compete in to win money or you
91:21 - can even win an opportunity to work for
91:23 - a company which is hosting the
91:26 - competition now let's download a data
91:29 - set
91:31 - so let's download this yoga that's it

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back to our new course on data visualization with pandas in this course we are going to study the inbuilt data visualization abilities of pandas this is gonna be an introductory video so let's get started so our first question is what is Theta visualization data and information visualization popularly called as database or Infosys is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information it is particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or the information is numerous for example the time series Theta by using visual elements like charts graphs and Maps data visualization tools provide an accessible way to analyze and understand Trends outliers and patterns and data so basically what is the benefit of data visualization is that it helps to analyze Theta in a better way and predict the future values or outcomes of data now let's move on to our next question which is is data visualization an art or a science so we know that data and information visualization has its roots in the feed of statistics and is therefore generally considered a branch of descriptive statistics however both design skills are statistical and Computing skills are required to visualize data effectively it is argued that it is both an art and a science this is because data visualization has its Concepts based on descriptive statistics while to draw plots or Maps we require design skills so that's why it's both an art and a science also please note that the study of Statistics has two major branches the descriptive statistics involves organization summarization and display of data while the inferential statistics involves using a sample to draw out conclusions about a population now let's move on to our next topic which is why data visualization or what are the benefits of data visualization the first one is visualize Theta is processed faster the second one is data visualization dashboard supports visual Learners so there are some people who can't understand Trends from the text or the numeric data easily so data visualization is very important for these people or the visual Learners third one is that data visualization tools show in sites that may be missed in traditional reports we know that the numeric reports are very long and lengthy and it's easier to miss Trends or insights from those reports so data visualization helps to visualize those reports and find out the trends more effectively it helps us to find out the room for improvement it can also help in boosting the productivity and sales for a corporation and last one is it helps out to find Trends from digital as already discussed and our last topic is the plot types that we are going to cover in pandas so these are area plots bar plots line plots Scatter Plots box plots hexagonal bin plots kernel density estimation or KDE plots and histograms so these are the plot Heights that we are going to draw in pandas so in today's lecture I introduce you to the concept of data visualization and the plot types that we are going to draw in this course that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I am going to introduce you to the concept of style sheets so let's get started so today's topic is tile sheets so matplotlib has style sheets that you can use to make your plot look a little nicer so style sheets make your plots or charts attractive and appearance so these sheets can include plot B image plot GG plot and a few more other styles that we'll discuss in this lecture so what is a style sheet or how do style sheets work so basically they create a set of style rules that your plots follow they are like fashion influencers like fashion influencers or celebrities create fashion trends that you guys follow in a similar manner stylesheets create a set of style Rules start your plots follow and remember that the main objective of having style sheets is to make your plots look more attractive and nice they give a more professional look to your plots now let's demonstrate with an example so I'm gonna import numpy as NP and import pandas as PD and I'll read a data frame so df1 is equal to PD dot tweet CSV and I'm going to pass df1 and index called is equal to zero I'll display the data frame first so this is our data frame it contains thousands rows and four columns with the name ABC and T now I'm going to create a histogram first so this is the histogram don't worry I'll cover in detail how to create a histogram now let's call the style for that I have to import matplotlab Dot Pi plot as PLT the first oil that we are going to use is GG plot so I'll write PLT dot style dot use and I'll pass ggplot and I'll draw the histogram once again so DF of a DOT is it is ts1 so it is ts1 so this is our resultant plot after using the style tgp now let's call another Style so let it be B image this time so I'll write PLT dot style dot use B image and I'll create or I'll draw the histogram once again so this is the resultant histogram after using the style P image now let's call one more Style that is dark background to create darker background in your plots well call the style PhD dot style dot use dark background and I'll draw the histogram one again so it is df1 and not DF so that's why I got an error this is the resultant plot after calling the style dark background now let's call the last Style which is 5 38 so I'll write PLT dot style dot use 5 38. let me just pass it 5 30 8. now I'll draw this program once again so it's TF of a DOT hist sorry it's tf1 I tend to forget it every time so this is the resultant plot after calling the style 5 30 it's so that's all about the style sheets and its application to make your plots look a little nicer and I'll discuss histogram in detail in future video that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to teach you what is an area plot and how can we draw area plots using pandas so let's get started so today's topic is area plot so first of all we are going to draw a stacked area plot so draw a start area plot so what is an area of node an area plot the space quantitative data visually this function wraps the map plot lib area function so in a line plot we just have line but in an area plot we have heated area I'm sure you must have drawn area plots all the time as a teenager in school but now we are going to see how can we draw area plots and visualize Theta using pandas so the Syntax for drawing area plot is data frame Dot Plot dot area and we can specify the x coordinate or the x axis the yaxis and some additional arguments so you can find out more about additional arguments in the documentation of pandas but for now these are enough so I'll demonstrate now first of all I'm going to import pandas as PD and I'll read a CSP file and I'll store it in a variable as a data frame so this is our resultant data frame it has four columns and then rows I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot area to create the plot so we have four colors corresponding to the four columns and also note that the indexes act as the X values here by default and columns take the Y values we can also change them by passing the value of x while calling the method or the function now let's create our own data frame and draw an area plot for it so I'll write DF is equal to p d dot ETA frame and this time I am going to pass a dictionary if you don't know how to create a data frame from a dictionary please refer to our previous course on pandas where I have covered these Topic in detail so I have three Keys here in my dictionary they are sales signups and visits also I have to pass the index after I finish the dictionary so I'll write the index is equal to PD Dot date underscore range and I'll specify the start the end and the frequency so the index in this case is form of date and I'll pass frequency value also so I have created a data frame successfully this is the resulting data frame now I'll write DF Dot Plot dot area and this is the resultant area plot so area plots as that by default and the index values can be changed as per our convenience please take care of these two things the index values can be changed as per our convenience and the area plots are start by default so to produce an unstacked plot we have to pass that is equal to false so I will demonstrate how to draw an unstacked area plot solved by DF Dot Plot dot area and I'll pass the start as false so this is the resultant area plot also note that we can draw an area plot for a single column by passing the Y value as the name of that particular column also we can change the x axis value explicitly for that I'll write DF Dot Plot dot area and I'll specify the x axis so it is giving me an error I think this is because I don't have any column by the name day let me just go back and check once so I have no column by the name day so let me change it to some valid column so let it be sales so this is the resultant area plot in today's lecture I taught you about area plots what are area plots and how to draw area plots using pandas that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today I am going to teach you about bar plots so let's get started so the topic for today is power plot so first question is what is a bar plot a bar plot is a plot that represents categorical data with rectangular bars with lens proportional to the values that they represent I'm sure you have must have drawn bar plots when you were in standard 5 or 6 and they continue till you are in college so bar plot shows comparisons among discrete categories one axis of the plot shows the specific regions being compared and other axis represents the major value now you have an X and A yaxis so the x axis shows the categories you are comparing and the yaxis represents the values that you have measured so this is all about power plots when we refer to the theory so one axis of the plot shows the specific categories being compared and other axis represents a major value so the Syntax for drawing power plot is data frame Dot Plot dot bar you can pass the x value the Y value and some additional arguments I have passed this as none initially but we can pass some column value so x y and some additional arguments that you can find in the documentation of pandas now let's demonstrate so I'll just write import pandas as PD and I'll run this cell and I'll read a data frame so df2 is equal to PD dot read CSV so I'll write df2 in Brackets and I'll run this I'll display the data set or the data frame so it has four columns as shown now in order to draw the actual plot I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot bar and this is the resultant bar plot here we have four colors one color corresponding to each column a b c and d and also we have nine categories corresponding to each index representing the index values 0 to 9. so it takes index as the categorical or the categories so by default this plot is not start to get a stacked version we have to specify start is equal to true so by default it isn't start to get the Stacked version we have to specify start is equal to true I'll draw or I'll plot the Stacked version so I'll write df2 Dot Plot dot bar and I'll pass that is equal to true so this is the Stacked version we don't have different bars we have one bar corresponding to one category so this is the Stacked version and that's all about plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to introduce you to the concept of line plots and I am going to demonstrate how can we draw line plots using functions offered by pandas so let's get started so the topic is line plot so line plot is also called as a plot series or data frame as lines these are the alternative names for line plot also called as a plot series or data frame as lines so the line plot function is useful to plot lines using data frames values as coordinates so it's useful to plot lines using data frames values as coordinates now I'll discuss the syntax so the syntax is data frame Dot plot dot line and we can pass the parameters such as the xaxis the yaxis and some additional arguments you can find out more information on these additional arguments in the official pandas documentation let's demonstrate now so first of all we are going to draw line plot for a series to line plot for a series so it makes sense that we have to create a series first so s is equal to PD dot series and I'm going to pass a python list so we have a series now now we can draw a plot using s Dot Plot dot line I forgot to import pandas so let's import pandas so I'm going to write import pandas as PD and then I'll run the cell again so this is the resultant sine plot for the series we have created this is the simplest line plot the line plot for a series now let's draw it for the data frame now we are going to draw a line plot for the Theta frame we need a data frame first let's read it from the CSV file so df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV and we'll pass df1 and I'll display the data frame this is the resultant data so it has five columns here now I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot line and I'll pass X is equal to df1 dot index Y is equal to B so we are taking the value of the column B on yaxis and the value of index on the x axis and we are going to take the figure size as 12 comma 3 and we are going to take the line width as 1. these are some additional arguments you can find more about them in the documentation of pandas giving an error so let's see why is it giving an error here I think it's because I have not imported the data frame very well I need to include the index column also when I import a data frame so let me just add it so index column is equal to zero so this is the data frame now let me just correct this thing so let me just make a few changes quickly so let's observe the line plot without any argument so this is the resultant time block now let's change the line width so it becomes a little Messier now let's decrease the line width so this is a very light shaded line plot now let's change the yaxis value because it's difficult to observe a lot of things at once so Y is equal to B so it's giving the line plot only for column B and I've changed the line width now it's a little nicer so this is how we can draw line plot for the data frame that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to introduce you to the concept of Scatter Plots and I'll demonstrate how to create a scatter plot so let's get started so today's topic is Scatter Plots so our first question is what is a scatter plot so a scatter plot is the type of data visualization technique that shows relationship between two numerical variables in form of dots or spheres because we can't change the size of dots as well so it is a type of data visualization techniques that shows a relationship between two numerical variables for plotting so for plotting to scatter using data frame class there is a member called plot and calling this scatter method on member plot draws a scatter plot if you don't understand what is this you can find more about it in the official documentation of and as so calling the scatter method on the member plot draws a scatter plot so the syntax is data frame Dot Plot dot scatter and you can pass x y values x axis Y axis then the size of the dot and the color of dots these are some of the parameters there are more parameters you can find more about them in the documentation now let's demonstrate how can we draw a scatter plot so I'll import pandas as PD and I'll feed a data frame first so df1 is equal to pd.28 CSV I'll pass the file name and index column as 0. so this is our resultant data frame now I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot scatter I'll pass X as a fires B and this is the resultant scatter plot now we can change the color map of the plot to make it more attractive so for that I'll write df1 Dot Plot dot scatter and I'll pass X is equal to if Y is equal to B these are the column values and pass this color as C and the C math as cool warm so this is the resultant scatter plot also it's important to know that we can change the size of dots to indicate the value of a column so big dot or a biggest sphere will indicate a greater value and a smaller dot will denote a smaller value also note that we have to pass the size as a list and not a scalar so I'll write df1.plot.scatter I'll pass X as a y as p and the size is equal to df1 C multiplied by 100. so it gave me an error because oh I have to correct it and change the equal to sign to multiply and small C2 capital c so just hang on a second so I have to change the equal to sign to multiply now I'll run so this is the resultant scatter plot but it's not very attractive right now and it's difficult to read so I'll make a few more changes that is I'll pass the C value as capital c and I'll change the cmap value as well to see map is equal to cool warm let me change the C value as well C is equal to Capital C and cmap is equal to cool warm I'll run this this is the resultant plot or the scatter plot and it's more beautiful that's all about Scatter Plots and how to draw Scatter Plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualizations with pandas in today's lecture I'll explain what is a box plot and I'll demonstrate how can we draw box plot using functions offered by pandas so let's get started so today's topic is box plots so what is a box plot a box plot is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles now what are quartiles imagine we have a distribution the median divides it in two parts if we have three such entities which divide the distribution in four equal parts those entities are called as quartiles so box plot is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles box plot is also used for detection of outliers in a data set it captures the summary of the data efficiently with a simple box and whiskers and allows us to compare across groups so another point to note is that box plot is also used for detection of outliers in a data set now what are outliers these are the values which are very far away from the normal data or the general data in that data set there's a lot of difference between these values and the mean or the central location box plots allows us to summarize a sample using the 25th the 50th and 75th percentiles these are also called as lower quartile median and upper quartile please always remember that the 50th percentile the median and the entity which divides the distribution in two equal parts is median we'll study more about box plot and quartiles in statistics and we'll also see how can we calculate quartiles for a given distribution so more about box plot and quartiles and future videos on statistics or statistics for data science now it's important to know that a box plot consists of five important things or entities so let me just change it to Colin yeah now the first one is the minimum value the second is the first quartile or the lower quartile the third one is the median the median divides the distribution into two equal parts the fourth one is the third quartile or the upper quartile and the last one is the maximum value now let's demonstrate how can we actually draw a box plot so I'll import pandas as PD then I'll read a CSV file and extract a data frame from the file so DF is equal to read CSV df2 so it's p d dot rate CSV so just correct it DF is equal to PD dot read CSP now this is R data frame now I have to write DF Dot Plot dot box and I'll run this cell so it's giving an error it's D it's not df2 so this is the resultant box plot please note that this green line in the center denotes the median so this is the simple box plot here you can see that this portion this portion this portion and this portion contains 25 percent each so this total is hundred percent if it had any outlier it would be outside the box or the whiskers we can also enable grids and add other parameters so if I want to enable the grid I have to write DF Dot Plot dot box grid is equal to true so for more details please check the documentation you will get a lot of things if you refer the documentation let me draw the grid version so I'll specify grid is equal to true so this is the version with grid so in today's lecture I covered the box plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization using pandas in today's lecture I'm going to explain you what is a hexagonal pin plot and I'm also going to demonstrate how to draw one using pandas so let's get started so our topic is hexagonal bin plots in a hexagonal bin plot a twodimensional lattice is divided into number of hexagonal quids or size n cross M based on the number of data points of the distribution of two variables X and Y that fall under any hexagon the hexagons are given a color so a hexagonal bin plot consists of a lot of small hexagons and on one side we have an xaxis and on the other side we have a yaxis and these hexagons are given colors depending on the values of these variables that are X and Y hexagonal bin plots are generally used when the data is very large or we can say that it is really very helpful when the number of points in the distribution is very very large so you just need to remember that there will be a lattice which will be divided into smaller hexagonal grids and there will be two variables X and Y and smaller hexagonal grids will be given a color depending on the value of X and Y also note that it is used when number of points and the distribution is very large now let's demonstrate this time we'll create a new data frame because we need a data frame with a lot of points and the previous data frames were not large enough so this time I'm going to use the ram n method of numpy to create a data frame so data frame is equal to PD dot data frame and I'll pass NP Dot random so NP dot random dot Rand n and let the size be 1000 comma 2 and the column names Be A and B now I'll run this just hang on a second so I'll run this so this is giving me an error because I have not imported numpy now let me run this again and this is the resultant data frame now we have created the data frame let's plot now so to plot I'll write DF Dot Plot Dot X bin and I'll pass the value of X and Y sorry it's Y and B in inverted commas yeah so this is the resultant hexagonal pin plot it's not very clear I'm not able to derive any information from this plot so I'll customize it a little bit so I'll write df.plot.x bin and I'll pass the value of x and y and I'll change the grid size to 25 and the color map to cool warm now it's a little more clear than the previous one you can derive the information from these hexagonal grids more easily now let's try to customize it a little bit more so that's a mistake I need to change it to Capital so this is another customization for a better experience so that's all about hexagonal bin plots in pandas we'll study about it more in statistics that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in this lecture I'm going to teach you about KDE plot and density plots and I'll also demonstrate how to draw these so let's get started so today's topic is KDE plots so in statistics kernel density estimation or KDE is a nonparametric way to estimate the probability density of function or PDF of a random variable so in short the KDE plot or the kernel density estimation plot gives us the idea about the probability density function or PDF of a random variable this function will use gaussian kernels and include automatic bandwidth estimation or determination we'll study about all these in statistics in details but remember that the KDE plot gives us an idea of the PDF of a random variable and this function will use causing kernels and include automatic bandwidth estimation Flash determination so more about PDF random variables and gaussian kernels in statistics statistics is very interesting branch of mathematics which intersects with data science now the Syntax for KD plots is data frame Dot Plot dot KDE and we can pass the parameters like bandwidth method IND and some additional arguments so you can pass these parameters or not they are optional so these are bandwidth method IND and some additional arguments you can find more about them in the documentation of pandas so all these parameters are optional now let's demonstrate how to draw a KDE plot so first of all I'll import pandas as PD then I'll read a CSV file and I'll extract the data frame from the file so df2 is equal to PD dot read CSV and I'll pass df2 now I am going to draw the plot wait a second it's the F2 of a Dot Plot dot KDE and here it is so this is the KDE plot now we can also analyze multiple columns at once this is for the column A only so we can also analyze multiple columns at once so for that we'll use a density plot instead of a KDE plot so I'll write df2 Dot Plot Dot density and I'll close the bracket and I'll run it so this is the KDE plot and this is the density plot so in today's lecture I taught you the KDE plot and the density plot and I also demonstrated how to draw these plots so that's all about KDE and density plots that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to teach you how to draw histograms with pandas so let's get started so the topic is histo grams so histograms are a way of representing the distribution of T down in other words histograms depict Hardware distributions shape look like when viewed with the help of a graph so a histogram is made up of bars which each bar representing a certain data values the height of the bar indicates how many data points fall within that range so what is the difference between histogram and a bar plot is a histogram is somewhat continuous it's not continuous on the yaxis but it's continuous on the xaxis while a bar plot is discrete on the xaxis as well as the yaxis so histograms can be used to compare two data sets or to observe how distribution of data changes over time we can draw histograms to see what is the type of our distribution for example is it normal or binomial or anything so it helps us to doubt conclusions we apply the histogram method on individual series of a data frame let's plot now so first of all I'm going to import pandas as PD and then I'm going to read a data frame so let it be df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV so it should be read CSV I made a small mistake so please take care because I wanted to create a data frame so I directly wrote a data frame but it's read underscore CSV now let me display the data frame so this is our data frame now to draw a histogram I'll write df1 and in square bracket the column name Dot Plot Dot paste and brackets close so this is our resultant histogram on xaxis we can see the values are on the y axis we can see the frequency for details or for a more final view we can increase the number of pins so let me just increase the pins to 70. so let the bins be 70. so now you can see the histograms in much more fine detail so it's kind of a normal distribution If You observe it carefully it's not a proper but it's sort of a normal distribution a normal distribution is better visible with the KDE plot because it's a continuous distribution now let's see how to observe multiple columns at once so for that we have to write df1 Dot Plot dot hist this time we are not passing or not applying it on a series file on the whole data field so in this case it is Tagged so it's not clearly visible now I have an assignment for you you have to observe multiple columns at once but not in the same chart you have to come up with the method of plotting different charts for each column so you can observe it more carefully that's all about histograms that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture we are going to discuss the problem statement of our data visualization project so let's get started so first of all we are going to take a look at the project objectives so the project title or the project topic is data visualization with pandas the first objectives of the project is Introduction to data analysis the second one is demonstration of the concept of style sheets the third one is regarding the different kind of plot with pandas and Port one is regarding the modification of plots to create more defined and beautiful or professional plots our project has been divided into six parts or six tasks now we are going to discuss every one of them in detail so let's move on so our first task read the data frames df1 df2 and df3 and analyze them with the help of pandas function also note that these data frames can be found at the GitHub repository provided along with this course the second task is read the CSV file name df1 that is data frame one and pass the column 0 at the index while reading for column B drop a histogram and use different styles to improve the appearance of your plot so this sub task or this task is regarding style sheets now moving to the next task read the CSV file name df3 or data frame 3 draw a scatter plot past x value as column A Y value as column b c value as read its value as 50 and figure size as 12 comma 3. also draw a histogram for column e of the data frame use the parameters as Alpha value as 0.5 and bins is equal to 25. now moving on to the next task info task we have to draw two plot first of all to our box plot comparing columns A and B of the data frame tf3 and the second one is draw a KDE plot of the column D of df3 the fifth task is draw a density plot for data frame 3 or df3 and figure out how to change line width and make the line style Dash this is something that is like providing a makeover to your plot beautifying the plot can help us figure out patterns from the plot a little faster and it looks good as well so our last task or the six tasks is create an area plot for all the columns for just the rows up to 30 for the data frame df3 so we have to include only the rows up to 30 and we have to include all the necessary columns also we need to figure out a way to display the legend outside of the box that's all about problem statement project objectives and description of tasks that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the Task 1 of our project so let's get started so our first task is read the data frames df1 TF2 and df3 and analyze them with the help of pandas function also link to these can be found at the GitHub repository provided along with this code so our first job is reading the data frames so the title is reading the data frames now we are going to import pandas as PD so import pandas as PD and then we are going to read the data fix so df1 is equal to PD dot read CSV and I'm going to pass df1 and index as the First Column so index is called is equal to 0. similarly df2 is equal to PD Dot vcsc and I'm going to pass TF2 and df3 is equal to PD dot read CSV and I am going to pass the df3 now I am going to display the data operates so displaying the data frames so this is the first data frame it has four columns capital e b c and d so it has thousand rows and four columns the second data frame has four columns ABCD and 10 entries or rows and the third data frame also has four columns ABCD and 500 rows now let's see the description so they have one dot describe so this is the description of the first data set so the count is thousand and you can see the mean the minimum the maximum and the quartile distribution similarly we can analyze the second data set as well as the third data set so this is the description of the second data set now let's describe the third data set so df3 dot describe so this is the description of the third data set now we'll try to extract some information so we'll use the info method so this is the information on First Data set so it has 1000 entries and four columns and all are not null similarly we can analyze the second data set as well as the third data set so this is the information regarding the second act third data set respectively now let's fetch all the key values or the column names so we use the keys method so all the data sets have four keys so a b c d only the difference is the capital and small letter notations so we use the keys method to fetch all the column names now let's analyze the correlation among all the columns in different data sets so our next objective is to analyze the correlation so correlation analysis I'll use the core method so this one dot core so this is the correlation among the four Columns of first data set similarly I can analyze the correlation and second data set as well as the third data set so this is the correlation in third data set so we have successfully read and analyze all the data sets that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the second task of our project so let's get started so our second task is read the CSV file name tf1 that is data frame 1 and pass the column 0 as the index while reading it for column B draw a histogram and use different styles to improve the appearance of your plot so these are the two sub tasks under the tasks 2. so now let's solve so this is the second task first of all I am going to import pandas as PD so import pandas as PD and now I'll proceed to read the data free so I have to write data frame name or the F3 is equal to PD dot feed underscore CSV and I have to pass tf1 and I have to pass index column or index underscore call is equal to 0. so I pass column 0 as the index so I've passed column 0 as index now let's draw histograms and use different styles so we have completed the first sub tasks and now we have to complete the signal task now let's talk histograms and use different styles so I'll write df1 B dot hist so this is giving me an error let me just figure out why it's giving me an error so this is probably because the column name is capital so I'll change it and this is the histogram now let's use different styles so using styles so for that we have to do an import so we have to import matplotlib dot Pi plot as PLT and we have to write an extra command that is PLT dot style dot use and first of all I'll pass GG plot so this is the resultant histogram after the use of style GG plot now let me just change it to bmh and I'll display the histogram once again so this is the resultant histogram after using the style B image now we'll use dark background so I'll write in the bracket dark underscore background and I'll display the histogram once again so this is the resultant histogram after using the style dark background now let's move on to our last style that is 5 38. so I'll use the style 530 eat so this is the resultant plot after using the style 538 so my personal favorite is GG plot because it gives a unique appearance to a plot so my personal favorite is ggplot yours can be dark background or bmh or 538 or many more you can pick your favorite but mine is GG plot so we have completed our second task of the project that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the third task of our project so let's get started so the third task is read the CSV file name gf3 that is data frame 3. draw a scatter plot pass the x value as column A Y value as column b c value as read s value as 50 and figure size as 12 comma 3. also draw a histogram for column A of the data frame and use the parameters as Alpha value of 0.5 and number of bins is equal to 25. now let's solve this so first of all let me just write the heading task 3 and let me import so let me import pandas as PD so my first job is to read the data frame so df3 is equal to PD dot read underscore CSV and I'll pass data frame 3. also let me just print the first five entries of the data set now we have to draw a scatter plot so for that I'll write TS3 Dot Plot dot scatter and I'll pass the x value as a y value as B s is equal to 50 and fixed size of the figure size as 12 comma 3 and I'll just run the cell so this is our scatter plot now let me change the color by specifying the C value as straight so this is the resultant plot now we are going to change the color now let's change the color for that I'll just copy and paste the command and I'll add an extra parameter that is C is equal to data I'll run this cell and this is the resultant plot so our second sub task is to create a histogram so for that I'll write the command to create a histogram that is df3 square bracket a because we are drawing a histogram concerning the column e so df3 e Dot Plot dot hist so this is our histogram knowledge change the Alpha value and the number of pins so this type is GG plot because I like it or I'll just change some parameters so I'll write df3 e Dot Plot dot hist Alpha is equal to 0.5 and bins equal to 25. so this is the resultant histogram so it is a little transparent and has number of pins as 25. so we have successfully salt are third task that's all for task 3. that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture we are going to solve the fourth dark of our project so let's get started so the task for is draw a box plot comparing columns A and B of the data frame df3 and also draw a KDE or kernel density estimation plot of the column D of the data frame now let's move on to the solution so the heading errors task 4. and the first sub task is draw a box plot so draw a box plot and compare the columns a so compare the columns A and B so I'm going to import pandas as PD and I'm going to read the data frame first so I'll write reading the data frame first and the command is tf3 is equal to PD dot read CSV and in the bracket I'll pass df3 I'll display the data frame so this is the resultant data frame so this is the data frame so first of all we'll draw a box plot for that I'll write df3 let me just write so df3 and square bracket I'll pass a list so it's it's like a list inside a list so in square bracket I have passed the list containing the elements A and B and I'll write Dot Plot dot box so this is the resultant box plot comparing the columns A and B you can't see the quartile distribution for both columns A and B so the quartile distribution seems to be different on the position of quartiles is also different so the quartile distribution of columns A and B is different as shown now let's move on to our second subtask dot s k d e plot or second sub task is regarding KDE plot so the target column for it is d so we are using small notation so it's small now I'll write df3 D Dot Plot dot KDE so this is the resultant KDE plot so this is the resultant KDE plot so we have completed our fourth task as well so task 4 has been completed that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the first task of our project so let's get started so the fifth task is draw a density plot for data frame 3 or tf3 and figure out how to change the line width and make the line style Dash now let's move on to the solution so this is task 5. so first of all I am going to read the data frame So reading the data frame so I'm going to import pandas as PD and then I'll write df3 is equal to PD dot read underscore CSV and I'll pass df3 I'll print the data frame so this is the resultant data frame now we are going to draw a density plot so for that I'll write tf3 Dot Plot dot density so let's draw a density plot first and the syntax is data frame name Dot Plot dot density so df3 Dot Plot dot density and I'll run this cell so this is the resultant density plot also note that a density plot provides a comparison of all the columns so we can analyze all the columns in a single plot so this is the density plot for all the columns now let's draw the density plot for a particular column and let that column be column e so I'll divide tf3 of a Dot Plot dot density so my keyboard must avoid that is plot so this is the resultant density plot for column e also note that a density plot for a single column will be same as the KDE plot let's see by drawing a KDE plot as well you can see that the shape and the structure is same so both of them are same now let's figure out how to change the line width and line Style so we have to change the line width and time Style for that I'll write df3 Dot Plot Dot density and I'll pass the line width or LW as 5 and line style as Dash or LS is equal to Dash Dash so this is the resultant density plot after changing the line width and line style this is not very attractive or clear so let's analyze for one column only so I'll write df3 square bracket a Dot Plot dot density and I'll pass the line width as 5 and Einstein as dashed so this is the resultant plot so we have solved the fifth task as well that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas today we are going to solve the sixth and the last task of our project so let's get started so our sixth task is create an area plot for all the columns for just the rows up to 30 for the data frame 3 and also figure out a way to display the legend outside of the box so we have to create an area plot for all the columns but up to 30th root only and we have to figure out a way to display the legend outside of the box now let's move on to the solution so let me just give the heading task 6. now I am going to import pandas as PD so import ant and small so import pandas as PD and then I'm going to read the data frame So reading the data frame so df3 is equal to PD dot read underscore CSV and I have to pass the data frame name as tf3 now I'm going to display the data frame so this is the data frame now our first task is to create an area plot so I need to write df3 Dot Plot dot area so this is the resultant area plot it covers all the four columns and all the rows so we need to make some changes so now we need to personalize or we can say that we require some personalization so we are going to draw an area plot only for the first 30 rows so there are two methods first is use of dot IX and the second one is the use of iloc method knowledge demonstrate so I have to write df3 Dot IX and I have to pass the slice 0 colon 30 and I'll write Dot Plot dot area I'll run this cell so this is giving me an error so let me just change it to iloc so if you are getting an error with DOT IX method you can use dot iloc method as discussed in the pandas module so I'll changed dot IX 2 dot i l o c just hang on for a second so I'll change it to dot i l o c I'll run this cell once again so this time I didn't get any error so I'll change it to dot i Loc so you can use either one I got an error so I use dot i l o c now let's change the alpha value that is make the plot a little more transparent for that I have to introduce one more parameter that is Alpha is equal to 0.4 so this is the resultant area now I need to figure out a way to display the legend outside the box so display the legend outside the box so I'll write so this is the legend and I need to display it outside the box so I'll write f is equal to PLT dot figure then I'll write df3 Dot iloc I'll pass the slice I'll write Dot Plot dot area and I'll pass Alpha is equal to 0.4 and e x is equal to F dot GCA you can also refer stack overflow to figure out how to display the legend outside the box and you can also use this method I'll write PLT dot Legend and I'll pass loc is equal to Center left so loc is equal to Center left and B box to Anchor B box to Anchor is equal to 1 .0 comma 0.5 and I'll write PLT dot show so I got an empty graph this time because I need to write all of this together so please take care of this thing so I'll write everything in one cell I'll run it and this is the resultant area plot where the legend is displayed outside the box now we have completed the task six successfully that will be all for today this video is brought to you by programming knowledge please like comment share subscribe and hit the Bell button for updates and stay tuned with us for next lecture thank you hi guys welcome back to our course on data visualization with pandas in today's lecture I'm going to give you an overview to KK so let's get started Eagle is on online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners it offers a no setup customizable jupyter notebook environment it provides access to gpus at no cost it allows users to collaborate with others find and publish data set the main use of Kegel is for analyzing and downloading data sets and we can even collaborate with others now let me just show you the website that is so it's www.kill.com here you can see that there are three mean sections of this website the first one is regarding the competitions second one is the short term courses and third one is regarding the data and code so first of all let's take a look at the competitions so these are some of the competitions the first one is regarding the Titanic disaster and it's a machine learning problem and we have to predict the survival and second one is regarding the housing prices and the third one is the spaceship so we have different levels here so there are different levels of difficulty let me just move back to the home and there are different types of problems for beginners intermediate and advanced let's move on to the second section that is short term courses here we have courses for beginner interpretiate as well as advanced level for in beginners we have intro to programming Python and intro to machine learning in intermediate we have intro to deep learning intermediate machine learning and pandas Anon Advanced we have time series feature engineering and computer vision now let's move on to the third section of this website which is browsing inspiring data and code so we can explore code of other people as well as we can explore the data set so here I can export the code for example I open this hurt attack analysis prediction so I can access the code written by other people so this is the code and these are the different sections of the notebook so this is the exploratory data analysis generally people document their code very well on cable so this is one of the notebook so we can't see the box plots here and this person has used machine learning model that is logistic regression for prediction so we this is training the model then we have evaluation we'll discuss all of it in detail when we'll cover machine learning and other portions so this is all about analysis so hard attack analysis prediction now let me just move on to the data sets so we have different data sets available here so like Instagram YouTube videos then dislike YouTube videos yoga so there are all varieties of data sets available on Google and the most interesting part is the competitions we can even host a competition here so let's take a look at the Active competitions so this is the first one that is first and future pair contact detection so there are 275 teams competing in this competition and the reward is hundred thousand dollars similarly there are different competitions that you can compete in to win money or you can even win an opportunity to work for a company which is hosting the competition now let's download a data set so let's download this yoga that's it so to download you just need to click this download button over here so I've click this button and I have all this data similarly you can access and download different kinds of data from this website that's all about KKL I'll discuss some sections in detail in future videos that will be all for today this
