00:00 - hello guys in the last video I've shown
00:03 - you how to perform math operations in
00:06 - your PHP script in this video I'm going
00:09 - to show you how to uh perform
00:11 - conditional operations using IF else
00:15 - condition or IFL statement and nested
00:18 - IFL statement so for example I have
00:20 - these two uh values or variables number
00:23 - one and number two both have some value
00:27 - inside them so number one is initialized
00:29 - with the value of 10 and number two is
00:31 - initialized with the value of 20 for
00:34 - example and you want to compare these
00:36 - two numbers and on the basis of
00:38 - comparison you want to show the result
00:40 - for example so like any other good
00:44 - language PHP also has this if comparison
00:49 - statement which
00:51 - compares the values okay and it always
00:55 - uh gives the result true or false and if
00:58 - the condition which whatever you pass in
01:01 - here is true it will perform this
01:03 - operation otherwise it'll go out of this
01:07 - uh condition right for example I want to
01:09 - compare the equality of these two
01:11 - numbers I can just uh write and don't
01:16 - forget to add and and equal to double
01:20 - equal to so whenever you want to compare
01:23 - the equality this is called comparison
01:27 - operator which is double equal to and
01:30 - when you provide single equal to it it's
01:32 - called assignment operation and it will
01:35 - assign uh the value to this variable so
01:38 - to compare just always use this double
01:41 - equal to here okay for example I'm
01:44 - checking whether number one is equal to
01:46 - number two which is obviously it's false
01:51 - then uh I can
01:55 - Echo for
01:57 - [Music]
01:58 - example
02:02 - two numbers
02:06 - are equal for example okay I will also
02:10 - provide this Break Tag to break the line
02:14 - and don't forget to give this semicolon
02:17 - here and now I will when I perform or
02:21 - when I run this so I will run this in my
02:24 - browser I will open math and I will see
02:27 - nothing because this condition is not
02:31 - true number one is not equal to number
02:33 - two so only and only if this condition
02:39 - is true the code inside this two
02:42 - parenthesis or these two curly braces
02:45 - will be performed otherwise it will go
02:48 - out of this Loop or out of this
02:50 - condition
02:51 - so I can just uh print
02:55 - here out
02:58 - of
03:00 - Loop or or
03:04 - statement statement okay so I can just
03:09 - refresh it and it says out of statement
03:11 - that means my condition is not true
03:14 - that's why it's uh it's going out of the
03:17 - statement and it's printing this now if
03:21 - you also want to catch the other
03:25 - condition whether this uh if this number
03:29 - is not equal to the number two what you
03:33 - want to do in that condition you can
03:37 - perform this by else it's
03:42 - just like this okay and when you do it
03:47 - like this everything which is not
03:50 - followed so for example the condition uh
03:53 - if the condition is false this will skip
03:57 - this uh curly bra and it goes to the
04:00 - else condition and whatever is the else
04:04 - condition you can print it from here
04:07 - okay so you can just say two
04:11 - numbers
04:13 - are not equal okay so this
04:17 - is IFL statement now suppose you want to
04:21 - check uh some other kind of uh other
04:26 - kind of comparison so for example you
04:29 - also want to check whether number is
04:33 - number two is greater than number one
04:36 - right so you can do it like this after
04:39 - your if condition you can just
04:42 - add else if and you can check the second
04:46 - condition whatever you want to check
04:48 - inside these two curly braces you can
04:51 - pass the your statement and for example
04:53 - I want to check whether number two is
04:57 - greater than number one
05:00 - okay and this is called comparison
05:03 - operator and in this case when a number
05:07 - two is greater than number one I can
05:10 - say
05:12 - here num two
05:17 - is greater
05:20 - than num one for example right so I will
05:25 - just save it and when I run the
05:28 - statement it say number two is greater
05:30 - than number one okay so in this way you
05:33 - can perform
05:34 - nested if conditions or if else
05:39 - conditions in this way so whenever you
05:41 - would just only want to compare two
05:45 - numbers and you don't want to show any
05:48 - other conditions like else you can just
05:51 - use if this and this or otherwise you
05:55 - want to check some other condition
05:58 - beside your main condition you you can
05:59 - use Els if and otherwise these two
06:03 - condition or all whatever condition you
06:06 - have provided are all false then your
06:10 - statement goes into this condition with
06:12 - is else condition and will go and print
06:15 - this else statement here so this is a
06:19 - simple uh conditional statement uh which
06:23 - you can use in PHP I I am sure that you
06:27 - if you have learned any other language
06:29 - that all language also includes this uh
06:33 - conditional
06:35 - statements so that's it for this video I
06:38 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

06:41 - now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in the last video I've shown you how to perform math operations in your PHP script in this video I'm going to show you how to uh perform conditional operations using IF else condition or IFL statement and nested IFL statement so for example I have these two uh values or variables number one and number two both have some value inside them so number one is initialized with the value of 10 and number two is initialized with the value of 20 for example and you want to compare these two numbers and on the basis of comparison you want to show the result for example so like any other good language PHP also has this if comparison statement which compares the values okay and it always uh gives the result true or false and if the condition which whatever you pass in here is true it will perform this operation otherwise it'll go out of this uh condition right for example I want to compare the equality of these two numbers I can just uh write and don't forget to add and and equal to double equal to so whenever you want to compare the equality this is called comparison operator which is double equal to and when you provide single equal to it it's called assignment operation and it will assign uh the value to this variable so to compare just always use this double equal to here okay for example I'm checking whether number one is equal to number two which is obviously it's false then uh I can Echo for example two numbers are equal for example okay I will also provide this Break Tag to break the line and don't forget to give this semicolon here and now I will when I perform or when I run this so I will run this in my browser I will open math and I will see nothing because this condition is not true number one is not equal to number two so only and only if this condition is true the code inside this two parenthesis or these two curly braces will be performed otherwise it will go out of this Loop or out of this condition so I can just uh print here out of Loop or or statement statement okay so I can just refresh it and it says out of statement that means my condition is not true that's why it's uh it's going out of the statement and it's printing this now if you also want to catch the other condition whether this uh if this number is not equal to the number two what you want to do in that condition you can perform this by else it's just like this okay and when you do it like this everything which is not followed so for example the condition uh if the condition is false this will skip this uh curly bra and it goes to the else condition and whatever is the else condition you can print it from here okay so you can just say two numbers are not equal okay so this is IFL statement now suppose you want to check uh some other kind of uh other kind of comparison so for example you also want to check whether number is number two is greater than number one right so you can do it like this after your if condition you can just add else if and you can check the second condition whatever you want to check inside these two curly braces you can pass the your statement and for example I want to check whether number two is greater than number one okay and this is called comparison operator and in this case when a number two is greater than number one I can say here num two is greater than num one for example right so I will just save it and when I run the statement it say number two is greater than number one okay so in this way you can perform nested if conditions or if else conditions in this way so whenever you would just only want to compare two numbers and you don't want to show any other conditions like else you can just use if this and this or otherwise you want to check some other condition beside your main condition you you can use Els if and otherwise these two condition or all whatever condition you have provided are all false then your statement goes into this condition with is else condition and will go and print this else statement here so this is a simple uh conditional statement uh which you can use in PHP I I am sure that you if you have learned any other language that all language also includes this uh conditional statements so that's it for this video I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
