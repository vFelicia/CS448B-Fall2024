With timestamps:

00:00 - okay so i have deleted this seller now
00:04 - later once i finish this video i will
00:07 - add another lady with a different
00:10 - picture of the same size as others
00:14 - okay so first i'll do a full restart and
00:17 - get
00:18 - and this this item will be removed
00:21 - okay so let's see
00:29 - okay and you can see there are now only
00:31 - three items i removed the
00:34 - the lady who was here okay because the
00:36 - image was not
00:38 - what we needed and it was causing lots
00:40 - of error now the image will load slowly
00:42 - i have little bit network issues today
00:45 - okay so for now this name name is done
00:49 - okay let's see so the name needs to be
00:53 - bold and little bit
00:54 - a little bit more towards the right and
00:58 - less
00:59 - towards the bottom okay so instead of 50
01:02 - i'm gonna make it 30 instead of 20 i'm
01:05 - gonna make it
01:06 - 25 and that text
01:10 - is gonna be bold so to for to for making
01:13 - it bold we use
01:14 - font weight okay and then we have
01:19 - font weight enum dot
01:22 - bold okay
01:27 - now let's see
01:31 - so this is fine now let's add the
01:34 - address okay
01:38 - so for that i'm gonna
01:41 - use this let's save it
01:45 - then again it is giving us an error now
01:48 - uh there is a way so that this sticks
01:52 - inside uh
01:53 - specified height only
01:56 - width only so let's see how to do that
01:59 - for that i'm gonna do a simple google
02:13 - not android
02:49 - okay so we can do this we can surround
02:52 - it with a container or a sized box
02:56 - okay so that is one method
02:59 - next method is we use over float
03:03 - text overflow ellipses but for that
03:07 - max lines okay so i'll try that because
03:09 - i haven't used
03:10 - that earlier okay so
03:14 - max lines is gonna be two
03:18 - and then overflow is going to be
03:21 - overflow
03:27 - so it was text overflow dot ellipsis
03:37 - cool let's see
03:41 - there was absolutely no change
03:44 - so let's add it will add a container to
03:47 - it
03:49 - container of width
03:52 - let's say 100
04:00 - okay now it is fine i i'll make it 120
04:12 - 140
04:14 - let me add the same padding over here as
04:17 - well
04:19 - because you can see the text is not
04:21 - aligned so we can't
04:23 - means guess the correct width
04:26 - okay so from top it is just gonna be 10
04:30 - but from the left it is gonna be same
04:34 - okay or maybe i'll make it 20
04:40 - and from top it is gonna be five
04:47 - and now let's see the width so let's try
04:51 - making it 150
04:53 - school 160
04:57 - still cool 180
05:02 - so now it is giving errors so let's see
05:04 - 170
05:07 - again error 160
05:16 - 164
05:19 - okay so we stick with 164
05:25 - and if we have more than that then it is
05:27 - giving us three dots
05:32 - okay
05:36 - so left is again gonna be 25 because now
05:39 - it is looking ugly
05:40 - it should all be on the same alignment
05:42 - well that is a basic principle in
05:44 - designing
05:45 - i was just trying something out
05:49 - okay let's do a full restart and then
05:53 - we will add this no rating little bit
05:56 - below
06:04 - okay now before we do anything let's add
06:07 - the style to this
06:09 - address so for that i'm gonna use the
06:11 - style
06:12 - then again google font
06:15 - dot pop-ins
06:20 - okay
06:23 - and then and inside the pop-ins
06:31 - i'm gonna copy these three okay it is
06:35 - google fonts
06:38 - then let's copy these three now the font
06:41 - size is
06:42 - gonna be 13.
06:46 - we don't need the font weight but the
06:48 - color
06:51 - i'm sorry for that but let's continue
06:54 - okay so now this is in pop-ins
06:58 - okay now let's add this thing
07:01 - to our no ratings as well
07:06 - now we can't have const over here since
07:09 - we are using google fonts we have
07:10 - discussed about it earlier
07:12 - okay no rating now let's align it
07:16 - align
07:20 - text align
07:27 - dot start okay let's see
07:34 - okay so it is in the starting only the
07:37 - entire space is this much
07:39 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm again gonna
07:41 - surround it with a container or a sized
07:44 - box would do in this case as well
07:47 - so width is again gonna be
07:56 - 164.00
07:58 - now again i will have to add the padding
08:03 - okay not this one i need to add this one
08:10 - now since we are adding padding i can't
08:12 - use a sized box over here
08:15 - okay so you see how we keep on changing
08:18 - widgets according to our necessity
08:23 - so now we have no ratings over here i
08:25 - want i don't want it to be black
08:27 - but to be gray so that it clearly marks
08:31 - that it is not a primary text
08:34 - that i want to the users to focus on but
08:37 - a secondary text which is there just
08:40 - fulfilling its purpose
08:42 - okay so with this i okay
08:45 - here is some error let's see
08:48 - okay so i think in the name only by
08:50 - mistake i have added an extra space
08:53 - i will remove it from the database okay
08:56 - with this our screen's ui is complete
08:59 - it looks somewhat as we have expected
09:03 - but not exactly we will have to work on
09:05 - to it
09:06 - so let's see what are the changes we can
09:10 - do
09:10 - in the next video thank you
