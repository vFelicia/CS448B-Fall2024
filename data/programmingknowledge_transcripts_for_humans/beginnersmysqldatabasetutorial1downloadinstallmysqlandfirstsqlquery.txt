06:39 - important maybe in future I will show
06:42 - you how to use them like this C++
06:47 - connector connector forn net
06:52 - and myql for
06:55 - Excel so we will start
06:57 - with using
07:00 - myql
07:02 - workbench first and then we will go to
07:05 - other
07:07 - products so it's
07:11 - installing so you can see it can take a
07:15 - few minutes to install all these
07:19 - softwares one by
07:25 - one connector
07:28 - obbc is

08:41 - configuration I want to use for
08:44 - configuration type my development
08:47 - machine that is my computer I will click
08:52 - next and in here this is the most
08:56 - important part you need to give a
08:58 - password password and
09:02 - the yeah password for
09:06 - your MySQL server so for
09:11 - Simplicity I'm giving it a
09:14 - password the root you can choose your
09:17 - own password which you can remember
09:21 - easily and I will click
09:26 - next and I want to use 10
09:30 - system account and window those service
09:33 - name is MySQL 55 I will click
09:37 - next and it's
09:42 - installing or

10:07 - click next once
10:10 - again and just finish
10:14 - your installation so in this way you

10:20 - for MySQL and it will automatically
10:24 - launch my SQL
10:28 - workbench

10:46 - this query
10:49 - database and it will show this
10:54 - box I want to set my
10:57 - password uh and my password is root once
11:01 - again and I will click okay and then I
11:05 - will click
11:08 - okay so it will
11:11 - open
11:13 - my
11:16 - SQL workbench environment so here I'm
11:20 - going to make new
11:24 - tables and new database
11:27 - and
11:29 - we will see how the queries are written
11:32 - and how the tables are
11:35 - made so I
11:40 - think the MySQL will provide one or two
11:43 - examples also for the databases like
11:47 - this sakila it contains so many tables I
11:53 - will click actor and click edit table
11:58 - and it shows me the data so this is the
12:02 - default which is provided by
12:04 - MySQL and the next video we will see how
12:08 - we can make our own database and how we
12:11 - can create our
12:13 - own
12:15 - tables
12:17 - so thank you very much for watching and
12:20 - please rate comment and subscribe and
