00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Android SQLite database tutorial for
00:05 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to delete data in SQLite database
00:11 - using our Android app so let's get
00:14 - started till now we have seen how to
00:16 - insert data how to update data and how
00:18 - to view data in SQLite database so let's
00:22 - add a new button and we will call this
00:25 - button as delete data so let's change
00:29 - the text of this button as delete and
00:33 - the button ID will change it to button
00:38 - delete ok now once we have this button
00:43 - what we are going to do is we are going
00:45 - to go to our database helper class which
00:49 - we have made in our previous videos and
00:53 - in this class we will create a new
00:56 - function and we will call it as delete
00:59 - data function or method as we say in
01:03 - Java so let's call it a public function
01:06 - which will return integer and we will
01:09 - call it as delete data function for
01:13 - example and it will take one argument
01:16 - and this argument will be the ID of our
01:21 - table okay so we know that we have four
01:26 - columns as I always mentions in our
01:29 - database table one is ID name surname
01:33 - and age this table we have been working
01:36 - on and we want to delete the data on the
01:40 - basis of ID because ID is our primary
01:45 - key here primary key means the unique
01:49 - identifier on the basis of which we can
01:52 - recognize the data which we want to
01:54 - affect in our in this case we want to
01:57 - delete this data right so that's why
02:01 - this function delete data will take this
02:05 - ID as an argument now the first thing
02:08 - which we will do is we are going to
02:11 - create the SQLite database object
02:14 - using this get writable database which
02:18 - we have done in the last videos also
02:20 - right so just copy this and paste it
02:25 - here
02:25 - okay and the next thing is we will take
02:29 - this database instance to delete the
02:32 - data
02:33 - so take DB here and we are going to call
02:38 - delete on this database instance and
02:44 - this delete takes three arguments one is
02:49 - the name of your table so let's press
02:52 - ctrl and go inside this delete function
02:55 - first of all and well let's see what it
02:57 - takes
02:58 - so this delete function takes the name
03:00 - of your table and then second argument
03:02 - is the where clause and the third
03:06 - argument is the value which you want to
03:09 - pass as a string array and in return it
03:12 - returns the number of affected rows if
03:16 - the data is deleted or number of rows
03:20 - which are deleted otherwise if no data
03:25 - is deleted
03:26 - it returns zero okay so we are going to
03:30 - use this return integer to check how
03:33 - many rows are affected or if any rows
03:37 - are affected or not and on the basis of
03:39 - this we can print the result right so we
03:43 - will come back to our database helper
03:45 - class and first argument we will pass it
03:47 - as the table name our table name is
03:50 - student table so we will take the table
03:53 - name variable and pass it as a first
03:56 - argument second argument is the clause
03:59 - and Clause is in this case is we want to
04:04 - delete the data on the basis of ID right
04:07 - and the ID column name in our case is ID
04:12 - here right so you can take this ID and
04:15 - we want to ask for the ID so we will ask
04:20 - what is the ID like this ID is equal to
04:24 - question and then
04:26 - this question mark will be replaced by
04:29 - the value we are going to pass here as a
04:32 - third argument so this will be the news
04:37 - string array and here we will pass the
04:42 - ID the value of ID which we take from
04:46 - here and this is going to delete your
04:49 - data now we are seeing here I am really
04:52 - returning integer so you can just write
04:55 - return because this delete method in the
05:00 - SQLite database class returns the
05:03 - integer right so this is the method we
05:08 - want to create in database helper class
05:10 - now what we are going to do is we are
05:12 - going to go to our main activity dot
05:15 - Java class where we will write of a code
05:21 - for the button press right so first
05:24 - thing we are going to do is we are going
05:27 - to declare one more button variable and
05:29 - we will name it as button delete for
05:33 - example and now we are going to cast
05:36 - this button in our on create method so
05:39 - in here I am going to copy this and I'm
05:42 - going to just cause this button delete
05:46 - and change the ID so ID dot button
05:50 - delete okay now next thing is as we
05:56 - always do is we will create a function
06:00 - which will be a public function and it's
06:04 - going to return nothing and we will name
06:07 - it as delete data function and it's
06:11 - going to take no argument and in here
06:14 - what we are going to do is we are going
06:16 - to take our button delete variable dot
06:21 - set on click listener and we will create
06:25 - a new onclicklistener and in here what
06:30 - we want to do is we just want to call
06:33 - our delete data function right so here
06:38 - what we are going
06:40 - - is we are going to declare an integer
06:43 - variable and we will call it as deleted
06:47 - rows right is equal to and then we are
06:53 - going to take the object of our my
06:56 - database class or database helper class
06:59 - which is my DB in our my case dot we
07:04 - will call this delete data function
07:06 - which we have created just now right and
07:09 - that this takes one argument which is ID
07:13 - so let's see what is the ID of this
07:17 - added text ID so this is added text ID
07:22 - itself right so we will just write edit
07:27 - text ID
07:28 - okay now we are going to take the text
07:31 - from it so we will call get text
07:33 - function here and then we are going to
07:36 - convert this into string right so
07:40 - whatever this function returns we will
07:43 - check how many number of rows are
07:46 - affected if this deleted rows not equal
07:51 - to 0 that means some rows are deleted or
07:56 - better we can say is greater than 0 okay
08:01 - if this is greater than 0 then what we
08:05 - are going to do I will copy this to save
08:07 - some time and we are going to create a
08:12 - toast
08:12 - which will show the message like this
08:14 - data deleted and if this deleted row is
08:23 - equal to 0 so if number of rows deleted
08:26 - is equal to 0 or less than 0 then we say
08:30 - data not deleted okay so this is our
08:39 - function which we want to create in our
08:42 - main activity dot Java file and don't
08:45 - forget to copy this and paste it in your
08:49 - oncreate method so call this function in
08:52 - your oncreate method
08:53 - and now we are going to run this program
08:57 - so let's run it so now our app is
09:02 - running first of all let's see what data
09:05 - we have so we will click view all and
09:09 - right now we have two rows right one is
09:13 - ID 1 and 1 is ID 2 so let's delete this
09:19 - ID 2 data for example right so what we
09:23 - need to do is we will just go to this ID
09:25 - added text and we will just write 2 here
09:30 - ok and now what we are going to do is we
09:35 - will just click delete and it says data
09:39 - deleted and we will see once again all
09:43 - the data so we will click view all and
09:46 - now only one row is remaining here so
09:50 - that means it has deleted of a row
09:53 - number 2 or ID 2 data okay in the same
09:58 - way if you write here 1 and click delete
10:01 - it will delete the row 1 or row with ID
10:06 - 1 so in this way you can delete the data
10:09 - in SQLite database using your Android
10:13 - app I hope you have enjoyed this video

hello guys welcome to the next video on Android SQLite database tutorial for beginners and in this video we will see how to delete data in SQLite database using our Android app so let's get started till now we have seen how to insert data how to update data and how to view data in SQLite database so let's add a new button and we will call this button as delete data so let's change the text of this button as delete and the button ID will change it to button delete ok now once we have this button what we are going to do is we are going to go to our database helper class which we have made in our previous videos and in this class we will create a new function and we will call it as delete data function or method as we say in Java so let's call it a public function which will return integer and we will call it as delete data function for example and it will take one argument and this argument will be the ID of our table okay so we know that we have four columns as I always mentions in our database table one is ID name surname and age this table we have been working on and we want to delete the data on the basis of ID because ID is our primary key here primary key means the unique identifier on the basis of which we can recognize the data which we want to affect in our in this case we want to delete this data right so that's why this function delete data will take this ID as an argument now the first thing which we will do is we are going to create the SQLite database object using this get writable database which we have done in the last videos also right so just copy this and paste it here okay and the next thing is we will take this database instance to delete the data so take DB here and we are going to call delete on this database instance and this delete takes three arguments one is the name of your table so let's press ctrl and go inside this delete function first of all and well let's see what it takes so this delete function takes the name of your table and then second argument is the where clause and the third argument is the value which you want to pass as a string array and in return it returns the number of affected rows if the data is deleted or number of rows which are deleted otherwise if no data is deleted it returns zero okay so we are going to use this return integer to check how many rows are affected or if any rows are affected or not and on the basis of this we can print the result right so we will come back to our database helper class and first argument we will pass it as the table name our table name is student table so we will take the table name variable and pass it as a first argument second argument is the clause and Clause is in this case is we want to delete the data on the basis of ID right and the ID column name in our case is ID here right so you can take this ID and we want to ask for the ID so we will ask what is the ID like this ID is equal to question and then this question mark will be replaced by the value we are going to pass here as a third argument so this will be the news string array and here we will pass the ID the value of ID which we take from here and this is going to delete your data now we are seeing here I am really returning integer so you can just write return because this delete method in the SQLite database class returns the integer right so this is the method we want to create in database helper class now what we are going to do is we are going to go to our main activity dot Java class where we will write of a code for the button press right so first thing we are going to do is we are going to declare one more button variable and we will name it as button delete for example and now we are going to cast this button in our on create method so in here I am going to copy this and I'm going to just cause this button delete and change the ID so ID dot button delete okay now next thing is as we always do is we will create a function which will be a public function and it's going to return nothing and we will name it as delete data function and it's going to take no argument and in here what we are going to do is we are going to take our button delete variable dot set on click listener and we will create a new onclicklistener and in here what we want to do is we just want to call our delete data function right so here what we are going is we are going to declare an integer variable and we will call it as deleted rows right is equal to and then we are going to take the object of our my database class or database helper class which is my DB in our my case dot we will call this delete data function which we have created just now right and that this takes one argument which is ID so let's see what is the ID of this added text ID so this is added text ID itself right so we will just write edit text ID okay now we are going to take the text from it so we will call get text function here and then we are going to convert this into string right so whatever this function returns we will check how many number of rows are affected if this deleted rows not equal to 0 that means some rows are deleted or better we can say is greater than 0 okay if this is greater than 0 then what we are going to do I will copy this to save some time and we are going to create a toast which will show the message like this data deleted and if this deleted row is equal to 0 so if number of rows deleted is equal to 0 or less than 0 then we say data not deleted okay so this is our function which we want to create in our main activity dot Java file and don't forget to copy this and paste it in your oncreate method so call this function in your oncreate method and now we are going to run this program so let's run it so now our app is running first of all let's see what data we have so we will click view all and right now we have two rows right one is ID 1 and 1 is ID 2 so let's delete this ID 2 data for example right so what we need to do is we will just go to this ID added text and we will just write 2 here ok and now what we are going to do is we will just click delete and it says data deleted and we will see once again all the data so we will click view all and now only one row is remaining here so that means it has deleted of a row number 2 or ID 2 data okay in the same way if you write here 1 and click delete it will delete the row 1 or row with ID 1 so in this way you can delete the data in SQLite database using your Android app I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
