00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can set up the C++
00:04 - development environment on your atom
00:06 - editor so I'm going to go step by step
00:09 - so first of all I'm going to show you
00:11 - how you can download the mingw compiler
00:14 - we are going to see this demonstration
00:16 - using mingw compiler and then i'm going
00:19 - to show you how we can download an
00:21 - install atom and then i'm going to show
00:24 - you how you can integrate both of them
00:26 - to develop your first C++ program so
00:31 - first of all we are going to download
00:33 - and install the mingw compiler so I'm
00:36 - going to show you how you can download
00:38 - it you just need to search for mingw
00:42 - here and the first link which will
00:44 - appear here will be from mingw dot o-r-g
00:46 - and when you open that website it's
00:50 - going to show you this kind of website
00:52 - we just need to go to the Downloads tab
00:55 - here so just click on the Downloads tab
00:58 - and once you click on the Downloads tab
01:00 - you will be redirected to the
01:03 - sourceforge.net website which hosts the
01:08 - mingw Exe file and then we are going to
01:12 - just click on this green button which
01:15 - says mingw get setup dot exe file so I'm
01:20 - going to just click on this so now I can
01:22 - see the download has been started and
01:25 - already finished so I'm going to click
01:27 - on this mingw get setup dot exe file and
01:30 - I'm going to minimize the browser and
01:33 - now you can see the mingw installer
01:35 - manager setup tool has been started so
01:38 - first of all we will just say install
01:41 - and this is the default location where
01:44 - mingw will be installed so I don't want
01:47 - to change it so I will leave it as
01:48 - default and say continue and then it's
01:52 - going to start the download of the
01:56 - Installer itself and then it's going to
02:00 - ask us to install some packages so I'm
02:04 - going to wait for some time until this
02:06 - download is finished so once this step
02:09 - is complete we will see this continue
02:11 - button is activated so I'm going to
02:13 - click
02:13 - on this continuum button we're just
02:15 - going to just start the mingw
02:21 - installation manager okay it's going to
02:24 - show us these options you can see here
02:28 - it's going to show us these options and
02:30 - these options are mint you have root
02:32 - developer tool mingw 30 to base and then
02:36 - GCC and GCC 14 GCC for g+ + which is for
02:41 - c++ and other mingw related packages so
02:47 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
02:49 - right click on every package and I'm
02:51 - going to say mark for installations so
02:55 - one by one I'm going to just say mark
02:57 - for installation for all the packages
02:59 - and once you are done with this marking
03:03 - for the check boxes you go to the
03:06 - installation on the left hand top side
03:09 - and then just say apply changes ok so
03:14 - just say apply changes which is going to
03:16 - start the installation of all these
03:19 - packages ok so this may take some time
03:23 - so you can see it's asking us to proceed
03:27 - so it says ok to proceed we will say
03:31 - apply is going to just start the
03:33 - installation of all these packages so
03:36 - now all the men GW packages are
03:38 - installed and I can see this message
03:40 - which says all changes were applied
03:43 - successfully you may now close the
03:45 - dialog so I'm going to just close this
03:48 - dialog and you can see everything is
03:50 - green in my case so I'm going to just
03:52 - close this Installer also and just for
03:55 - checking I will just open my folder
03:58 - Explorer and here in the C directory I'm
04:02 - going to just check where the mingw
04:05 - directory is there or not so you can see
04:07 - mingw directory is created for us right
04:10 - so I'm going to just go inside this
04:13 - directory and I'm going to go inside bin
04:16 - folder inside this me min GW directory
04:20 - and I'm going to copy this path and I'm
04:24 - going to add it to my environment
04:25 - variables so just
04:27 - copy this part up to bin and then right
04:30 - click on your Start button here and then
04:33 - just search for system so just click on
04:36 - system here and once this system window
04:39 - opens you just need to go to advanced
04:42 - system settings and then environment
04:45 - variables and then just choose the path
04:48 - environment variable in system variables
04:51 - and then either double click on it or
04:53 - just click Add it and then we are going
04:56 - to add a new variable and then just
04:59 - paste this path which is C colon
05:02 - backslash mingw backslash R bin right
05:06 - and I'm going to just click OK and then
05:10 - ok and then ok and I'm going to close
05:12 - this window
05:13 - and then I'm going to minimize this
05:15 - folder also now the next step is to
05:18 - check whether mingw is working so I'm
05:22 - going to just open my command prompt so
05:26 - right click on your windows button once
05:28 - again and then just click command prompt
05:32 - and in here we are going to check the
05:34 - version of g plus plus so just write G
05:36 - plus plus minus minus version and then
05:40 - press Enter which is going to give you
05:42 - the version of C++ in our case we have
05:44 - installed GCC version six point three
05:48 - point zero minus one ok basically it's
05:52 - six point three point zero so G plus
05:55 - plus is working fine on our Windows
05:58 - operating system now once you have the
06:01 - mingw compiler installed and you have
06:04 - set up the environment variable for
06:06 - mingw now we are ready to install the
06:09 - atom editor so just to open your
06:11 - favorite browser and search for atom
06:13 - editor and the first link which will
06:15 - appear here will be from a Tamayo so i'm
06:17 - going to click this link and once this
06:20 - web site opens you will see the
06:22 - Downloads button on the home page of
06:24 - this website which is this button which
06:27 - says download windows 64 installer I'm
06:30 - going to just click on this button it's
06:32 - going to download the executable file
06:34 - for at am editor right so I'm going to
06:37 - let it download it's about 132 megabyte
06:40 - while so it will take one to two minutes
06:43 - to download and once it's downloaded we
06:46 - are going to see how to install it so
06:47 - now this executable file is downloaded
06:50 - on our system so I'm going to click on
06:52 - this executable file and I'm going to
06:54 - minimize the browser and now you can see
06:57 - the installation has been started so you
06:59 - don't need to do anything to install
07:01 - automatic you just need to click on the
07:04 - executable file and just wait for the
07:07 - installation to be done and once the
07:09 - installation is complete
07:11 - otama data is going to launch
07:13 - automatically and this is the first
07:16 - message which you will see here I'm
07:19 - going to say no for now and let me
07:22 - maximize the item editor and now to
07:24 - support C++ development what you need to
07:27 - do is you need to click on this option
07:30 - which says install a package you can
07:33 - also press control-shift P to just open
07:39 - this kind of interface and then you can
07:42 - just say install packages and themes and
07:46 - then you will see the same interface
07:49 - okay so I either click on install
07:51 - packages and themes from here or
07:54 - otherwise you just need to click on the
07:58 - install packages option on the Welcome
08:01 - window ok so let me just close the other
08:05 - windows here so this settings window
08:09 - will be in the full screen so in the
08:13 - install packages what you need to do is
08:15 - you need to search for GPP compiler so
08:20 - search for this spreadsheet package
08:22 - which is called GPP compiler and it's
08:26 - going to search for this package and you
08:29 - can see this is the package which I am
08:31 - talking about and you can see the
08:33 - description it's for compile and run c
08:37 - and c++ within adam ok and around 130
08:43 - our downloads has been completed for
08:45 - this package so i'm going to just click
08:48 - on this install button which is going to
08:50 - install this package on our atom editor
08:54 - and once the installation is finished we
08:57 - are going to write our first C++ code or
09:00 - C code whatever you want to write and we
09:04 - will compile it so just wait for the
09:07 - installation to complete and now the
09:09 - package is installed on our Ataman
09:11 - heater so I'm going to just close this
09:14 - settings window and what I'm going to do
09:17 - is I'm going to open a new folder for
09:20 - example so I'm going to just go here and
09:24 - then I will just say open folder and now
09:29 - I'm going to just create a new folder in
09:32 - order to just open this folder inside
09:36 - atom so I'm going to name it as cpp and
09:39 - then I'm going to select this folder is
09:42 - going to open this folder inside atom
09:44 - and now to create a new C++ file I'm
09:48 - going to right click here and then I'm
09:51 - going to just choose the first often we
09:53 - say new file and then I'm going to name
09:56 - my file as main dot cpp or whatever you
09:59 - want to name your file and then press
10:01 - enter is going to create the main dot
10:06 - CPP file okay so now what I'm going to
10:09 - do is I'm going to just write our first
10:12 - C++ program on item editor so I'm going
10:17 - to just say include io stream and then
10:22 - I'm going to just write in mean and then
10:28 - these parentheses and the curly bracket
10:31 - and I'm going to return 0 here and then
10:37 - I'm going to just print hello walls so
10:40 - STD C out and then let's print hello
10:47 - world and then I'm going to just add STD
10:53 - and lines so en DL okay so this is our
10:59 - very simple C++ program and once you
11:03 - have finished writing your code what you
11:05 - can do is you can either press f5 to
11:08 - compile and run your code or you can
11:10 - right-click on the same window of same
11:14 - you know file so right-click on the file
11:17 - and you will find this option which says
11:19 - compile and run ok and the f6 of option
11:25 - is to compile and debug so right now we
11:27 - just want to compile and run our code so
11:30 - we will choose this option which says
11:31 - compile and run and if you want to debug
11:35 - your code you can just choose the f6
11:38 - option or compile and debug option and
11:42 - then if everything works fine you will
11:46 - see this kind of terminal and your
11:48 - output will be shown here which is hello
11:51 - world in my case right let's say there
11:55 - is some mistake or there is some
11:56 - compilation error in the code so this
11:59 - doesn't exist right now
12:01 - for example and I'm going to compile my
12:04 - code what it says is the compilation
12:07 - error so you can see E and DL is not
12:12 - valid
12:13 - you know code so I'm going to once again
12:16 - correct my code and once again run the
12:19 - code and it's going to you know run it
12:24 - once again right and if you want to
12:26 - debug your code you can just right-click
12:28 - and you can choose this option which
12:30 - says compile and debug or + f6 in your
12:34 - case and you can see you will see this
12:37 - kind of option which is for debugging
12:39 - your code so this is a gdb command if
12:43 - you are familiar with the gdb terminal
12:46 - commands you can also debug your C++
12:50 - code for any errors right so in this way
12:54 - you can set up your atom editor for the
12:57 - C and C++ development I hope you have
13:00 - enjoyed this video please rate comment

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can set up the C++ development environment on your atom editor so I'm going to go step by step so first of all I'm going to show you how you can download the mingw compiler we are going to see this demonstration using mingw compiler and then i'm going to show you how we can download an install atom and then i'm going to show you how you can integrate both of them to develop your first C++ program so first of all we are going to download and install the mingw compiler so I'm going to show you how you can download it you just need to search for mingw here and the first link which will appear here will be from mingw dot org and when you open that website it's going to show you this kind of website we just need to go to the Downloads tab here so just click on the Downloads tab and once you click on the Downloads tab you will be redirected to the sourceforge.net website which hosts the mingw Exe file and then we are going

may take some time so you can see it's asking us to proceed so it says ok to proceed we will say apply is going to just start the installation of all these packages so now all the men GW packages are installed and I can see this message which says all changes were applied successfully you may now close the dialog so I'm going to just close this dialog and you can see everything is green in my case so I'm going to just close this Installer also and just for checking I will just open my folder Explorer and here in the C directory I'm going to just check where the mingw directory is there or not so you can see mingw directory is created for us right so I'm going to just go inside this directory and I'm going to go inside bin folder inside this me min GW directory and I'm going to copy this path and I'm going to add it to my environment variables so just copy this part up to bin and then right click on your Start button here and then just search for system so just click on system here and once this system window opens you just need to go to advanced system settings and then environment variables and then just choose the path environment variable in system variables and then either double click on it or just click Add it and then we are going to add a new variable and then just paste this path which is C colon backslash mingw backslash R bin right and I'm going to just click OK and then ok and then ok and I'm going to close this window and then I'm going to minimize this folder also now the next step is to check whether mingw is working so I'm going to just open my command prompt so right click on your windows button once again and then just click command prompt and in here we are going to check the version of g plus plus so just write G plus plus minus minus version and then press Enter which is going to give you the version of C++ in our case we have installed GCC version six point three point zero minus one ok basically it's six point three point zero so G plus plus is working fine on our Windows operating system now once you have the mingw compiler installed and you have set up the environment variable for mingw now we are ready to install the atom editor so just to open your favorite browser and search for atom editor and the first link which will appear here will be from a Tamayo so i'm going to click this link and once this web site opens you will see the Downloads button on the home page of this website which is this button which says download windows 64 installer I'm going to just click on this button it's going to download the executable file for at am editor right so I'm going to let it download it's about 132 megabyte while so it will take one to two minutes to download and once it's downloaded we are going to see how to install it so now this executable file is downloaded on our system so I'm going to click on this executable file and I'm going to minimize the browser and now you can see the installation has been started so you don't need to do anything to install automatic you just need to click on the executable file and just wait for the installation to be done and once the installation is complete otama data is going to launch automatically and this is the first message which you will see here I'm going to say no for now and let me maximize the item editor and now to support C++ development what you need to do is you need to click on this option which says install a package you can also press controlshift P to just open this kind of interface and then you can just say install packages and themes and then you will see the same interface okay so I either click on install packages and themes from here or otherwise you just need to click on the install packages option on the Welcome window ok so let me just close the other windows here so this settings window will be in the full screen so in the install packages what you need to do is you need to search for GPP compiler so search for this spreadsheet package which is called GPP compiler and it's going to search for this package and you can see this is the package which I am talking about and you can see the description it's for compile and run c and c++

hello world in my case right let's say there is some mistake or there is some compilation error in the code so this doesn't exist right now for example and I'm going to compile my code what it says is the compilation error so you can see E and DL is not valid you know code so I'm going to once again correct my code and once again run the code and it's going to you know run it once again right and if you want to debug your code you can just rightclick and you can choose this option which says compile and debug or + f6 in your case and you can see you will see this kind of option which is for debugging your code so this is a gdb command if you are familiar with the gdb terminal commands you can also debug your C++ code for any errors right so in this way you can set up your atom editor for the C and C++ development I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
