00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - maven tutorial for beginners and in this
00:04 - video we will see how to exclude
00:07 - dependencies from our maven pom dot XML
00:11 - file so for example in the last video we
00:15 - have added this dependencies for
00:18 - hibernate in our pom dot XML and you can
00:21 - see there are lot of transitive
00:24 - dependencies added to our maven
00:28 - dependencies because of this hibernate
00:30 - jar file and one of the dependencies
00:34 - here is JBoss logging for example and
00:38 - let's say for some reason or the other I
00:41 - don't want this JBoss logging jar file I
00:46 - want to use some other type of logging
00:49 - for example log4j or any other logging
00:52 - jar instead of this Jeff boss logging so
00:56 - I want to exclude this from my project
01:00 - so how can I do this
01:02 - so to exclude this JBoss logging jar
01:07 - first of all you need to know the group
01:10 - ID and the artefact ID of it and the way
01:13 - of you know knowing this is a simple you
01:17 - just need to press ctrl and hover over
01:20 - your hibernate and just click it and
01:23 - this will open the hibernate BOM file
01:28 - and go to the palm dot XML file for the
01:33 - hibernate and in the dependency you can
01:36 - just copy the group ID and the artefact
01:40 - ID of this JBoss logging ok so just copy
01:45 - these two elements from here and then go
01:48 - to your pom dot XML file and inside the
01:52 - dependency element in which you have
01:55 - added this hibernate you just need to go
02:00 - just go below this version element and
02:04 - then add one more element called
02:07 - exclusions ok so just add exclusions
02:12 - inside the exclusion element we need to
02:16 - add exclusion
02:18 - okay so exclusion element and between
02:22 - this ex exclusion element we just need
02:25 - to paste this group ID and the artifact
02:28 - ID of JBoss okay so this will exclude
02:33 - the JBoss logging jar from our
02:37 - dependencies so you can see right now
02:39 - it's there this JBoss logging jar file
02:43 - but when I press save here let's see
02:46 - what happens so this is our JBoss and
02:48 - once we press this button
02:52 - our JBoss dependency is gone here right
02:56 - so the jar file for the JBoss is not
03:00 - anymore
03:02 - there once again when we just remove the
03:06 - exclusion and save the file and then we
03:11 - are going to see this JBoss logging jar
03:14 - file here so this is how you can exclude
03:16 - a particular jar file from your memory
03:21 - dependencies right so I hope you've
03:24 - enjoyed this video please welcome and
