00:00 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:05 - take a look at the chart creation
00:07 - process only
00:08 - but in this video we are going to take a
00:10 - look at how can we create batch charts
00:13 - and what is basically the concept of
00:15 - batch charts in ultrix so the batch
00:17 - charts are basically used to group the
00:19 - data as we
00:21 - previously saw in the video that we
00:23 - created a pie chart which provided us
00:25 - the sales percentage and the sales
00:28 - amount on the basis of the category now
00:30 - there are two things as we know in our
00:32 - data set that are present for grouping
00:34 - the data that is category and
00:36 - subcategory
00:37 - so here we have category and then we
00:39 - have subcategory so what i want to do is
00:41 - i want to create separate pie charts for
00:43 - three separate categories
00:46 - firstly in the furniture
00:48 - category chart i want the different sub
00:51 - categories that are part of the
00:53 - furniture and then i want them to show
00:55 - me that what is the total sales that has
00:57 - been done in each of these categories
01:00 - right similarly i want to create it for
01:02 - office supplies category and then for
01:04 - the technology category now instead of
01:06 - creating three charts
01:08 - each for separate categories what i'm
01:10 - gonna do is i'm just going to create a
01:12 - single chart
01:13 - with the help of the bad chart option
01:15 - alteryx would automatically create
01:17 - copies of the same chart for me right so
01:20 - let us see how we are going to do that
01:23 - here what we have is three tools the
01:25 - input tool the
01:27 - chart tool and the browse tool so first
01:30 - of all let's just go to the interactive
01:31 - chart tool click on configure chart
01:33 - option in the configuration panel
01:35 - to open up this interactive chart okay
01:37 - now first of all you need to go to this
01:39 - batch option and by default it would be
01:41 - turn to off so you need to click here to
01:42 - on
01:44 - it would ask you to select the columns
01:46 - through which you are going to group by
01:48 - your options so uh i'm going to group
01:50 - them by category so from the drop down
01:53 - you can just select category if you want
01:55 - another field through which you want to
01:57 - group it by so you can select the second
01:59 - field as well
02:00 - if you want custom title for the batched
02:02 - charts that you can
02:05 - do
02:05 - but i'm not just going to go with it uh
02:08 - the category is written and i'm fine
02:09 - with it okay
02:11 - next go to the layers option click on
02:13 - add layer uh and let's just provide it a
02:16 - name like pie
02:17 - chart
02:22 - okay
02:23 - now select the type to pi
02:26 - for the values what i'm going to do is
02:28 - select the sales value
02:31 - and let's just give it a few seconds
02:34 - till it is going to fetch all the
02:35 - records from the sales and put them over
02:38 - here
02:38 - so this kind of a chart is being
02:40 - generated which is of course very
02:42 - difficult to understand because it is
02:43 - not a correct chart
02:45 - then what i'm going to do in the labels
02:47 - column i am going to select the sub
02:49 - category
02:51 - so now
02:52 - our chart is clean and what we are
02:53 - getting over here is the name of the
02:55 - category which is furniture
02:57 - now in this furniture we have four sub
02:59 - categories the chairs which is
03:01 - represented in the blue color tables
03:03 - represented in the orange color
03:06 - bookcases represented in the green color
03:08 - and furnishings represented in the red
03:09 - color so the total sales of the
03:12 - furniture
03:15 - whatever the total sales value of the
03:16 - furnitures was it has been bifurcated
03:19 - into these four subcategories and
03:22 - it has uh taken the percentages as this
03:25 - so in the furniture most of the sales
03:27 - has been done by chairs that is 43.6
03:30 - percent
03:31 - then if we just click on the second page
03:33 - we would have the office supplies
03:35 - category
03:36 - which combines these sub categories from
03:39 - storage till fasteners
03:41 - now in each of these subcategories how
03:43 - the bifurcation of the sales has been
03:45 - done is being shown on the percentage
03:47 - basis on the third we have the third
03:49 - subcategory which is the technology
03:51 - category having four subcategories again
03:53 - with phones accessories machines and
03:55 - copiers
03:57 - now what customizations we can do over
03:59 - here is
04:00 - by going into this chart option
04:05 - uh and in this font option like if you
04:07 - want to change the font it says
04:08 - everything that you can change like if
04:11 - you want to increase the size so as to
04:13 - get a better look at what is happening
04:14 - over here
04:16 - okay
04:17 - then we have layers option through which
04:19 - you can just uh change the colors like
04:21 - these are the colors that have been
04:23 - taken by default but if you want some
04:25 - other color scheme to be there you want
04:27 - some other colors to be there that also
04:29 - you can change
04:31 - okay
04:32 - like this the divergent scales are there
04:36 - or the sequential scales are there too
04:40 - for a particular color that you can just
04:42 - select okay
04:43 - uh then we have the slice label that is
04:46 - what you want to be shown on the slice
04:47 - label right now the percentage has been
04:49 - shown if you want the value has to be
04:50 - shown as well that means what is the
04:52 - total number of sales that was done
04:55 - that you want to show and the label that
04:57 - means the value of the subcategory that
05:00 - to which subcategory it belongs that
05:02 - also you can select i'm just going with
05:03 - label and percentage not with the value
05:05 - part
05:05 - the order is sorted which means they are
05:07 - all sorted
05:09 - and if you want to show the legend or
05:10 - not this is the legion part you want to
05:12 - show it you want to hide it
05:15 - and then if you just hover over it then
05:17 - we are getting some additional
05:19 - information as well so that is uh
05:21 - controlled through this hover text value
05:23 - so i don't want the percentage to be
05:25 - shown i just want the label and the
05:26 - values to be shown over here because the
05:28 - percentage is already visible over here
05:31 - next we have is the chart option which
05:33 - you can use to set the width of the
05:35 - chart
05:36 - in pixels or in inches
05:38 - uh you can just select the um
05:40 - margins and the padding color etc the
05:44 - background color of the chart everything
05:46 - that you want you can just control from
05:48 - here okay
05:49 - so this is a custom color that i want
05:53 - this is the title
05:55 - if you want to change the title you can
05:57 - change it over here using lattice or
05:59 - using a simple
06:01 - text as well
06:03 - then we have the access option
06:05 - which is not
06:06 - been used over here next we have is the
06:08 - legion if you want to just change the
06:10 - way the legend is being shown that you
06:12 - can do you can just work with its size
06:15 - its color
06:17 - let me just get a black color for the
06:18 - legend
06:20 - for better visibility
06:22 - then we have the box if you want a box
06:25 - to be there on the legend
06:27 - the color of the border for the legion
06:29 - it's going to be red
06:32 - and the background color or if you want
06:34 - a different background color let's just
06:35 - go with
06:37 - this kind of color
06:40 - the orientation you wanted vertically or
06:42 - horizontally like this
06:44 - and the layer order of
06:46 - that
06:47 - what is the order of the layers
06:48 - accordingly you want that or not okay so
06:51 - this is where it is starting from
06:52 - storage all the way to fasteners okay
06:55 - ah then
06:57 - you can just close this
06:59 - and using the browse tool you can just
07:00 - run the browse tool to get a look at the
07:03 - chart
07:09 - so here it is how it is looking you can
07:11 - just adjust it
07:12 - and see that these three charts are
07:14 - lined one after the other
07:16 - now let us just render this chart using
07:18 - the render tool so let's just delete
07:20 - this browse tool for a bit
07:23 - go to the reporting and here we have
07:25 - this render
07:27 - in this render what i'm gonna do is just
07:30 - select the
07:33 - specific output file and save it
07:38 - in the form of
07:39 - png images three images would be created
07:43 - and select
07:44 - bulk charts or batch charts
07:51 - now click on save
07:54 - and if you just go to that location
07:58 - bad charts.png
07:59 - is what we are getting over here
08:04 - okay so let me just
08:06 - take a look at this
08:13 - so uh this is the kind of the image that
08:16 - we are getting over here
08:18 - and if you just zoom in these are being
08:21 - created like this
08:23 - uh in the form of a png image okay now
08:25 - let's see what happens if we just um
08:28 - store it in the form of a pdf document
08:30 - so for saving it i'm just going to
08:33 - select a pdf document
08:37 - here
08:38 - and just select batch charts as the name
08:45 - click on save
08:46 - and click on run to run the workflow so
08:49 - that the actual uh saving process occurs
08:53 - okay now let's just see how it is
08:56 - looking
08:58 - so here it is three pages have been
09:00 - created for the pdf each for a different
09:02 - category along with its legend along
09:04 - with its chart along with its everything
09:07 - so this is how we can use the render
09:09 - button to render the batch charts for us
09:12 - and that's all for this video with this
09:14 - we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course
09:17 - on alteryx as well
09:19 - during this course we learnt about the
09:22 - different tools and their
09:23 - functionalities we also got to
09:26 - see that what all actions we can perform
09:28 - through ultrix
09:30 - and we got to understand that there are
09:31 - a bunch of things that we can do now
09:34 - with more practice we would be able to
09:36 - create
09:37 - a really good charts for us render them
09:39 - and uh use it as the tool it is meant to
09:43 - be
09:44 - so that's all for this video that's all
09:46 - for this course
09:47 - i hope you all learned something new
09:49 - throughout this course i really hope you
09:51 - all enjoyed this journey
09:53 - thanks for watching goodbye

hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at the chart creation process only but in this video we are going to take a look at how can we create batch charts and what is basically the concept of batch charts in ultrix so the batch charts are basically used to group the data as we previously saw in the video that we created a pie chart which provided us the sales percentage and the sales amount on the basis of the category now there are two things as we know in our data set that are present for grouping the data that is category and subcategory so here we have category and then we have subcategory so what i want to do is i want to create separate pie charts for three separate categories firstly in the furniture category chart i want the different sub categories that are part of the furniture and then i want them to show me that what is the total sales that has been done in each of these categories right similarly i want to create it for office supplies category and then for the technology category now instead of creating three charts each for separate categories what i'm gonna do is i'm just going to create a single chart with the help of the bad chart option alteryx would automatically create copies of the same chart for me right so let us see how we are going to do that here what we have is three tools the input tool the chart tool and the browse tool so first of all let's just go to the interactive chart tool click on configure chart option in the configuration panel to open up this interactive chart okay now first of all you need to go to this batch option and by default it would be turn to off so you need to click here to on it would ask you to select the columns through which you are going to group by your options so uh i'm going to group them by category so from the drop down you can just select category if you want another field through which you want to group it by so you can select the second field as well if you want custom title for the batched charts that you can do but i'm not just going to go with it uh the category is written and i'm fine with it okay next go to the layers option click on add layer uh and let's just provide it a name like pie chart okay now select the type to pi for the values what i'm going to do is select the sales value and let's just give it a few seconds till it is going to fetch all the records from the sales and put them over here so this kind of a chart is being generated which is of course very difficult to understand because it is not a correct chart then what i'm going to do in the labels column i am going to select the sub category so now our chart is clean and what we are getting over here is the name of the category which is furniture now in this furniture we have four sub categories the chairs which is represented in the blue color tables represented in the orange color bookcases represented in the green color and furnishings represented in the red color so the total sales of the furniture whatever the total sales value of the furnitures was it has been bifurcated into these four subcategories and it has uh taken the percentages as this so in the furniture most of the sales has been done by chairs that is 43.6 percent then if we just click on the second page we would have the office supplies category which combines these sub categories from storage till fasteners now in each of these subcategories how the bifurcation of the sales has been done is being shown on the percentage basis on the third we have the third subcategory which is the technology category having four subcategories again with phones accessories machines and copiers now what customizations we can do over here is by going into this chart option uh and in this font option like if you want to change the font it says everything that you can change like if you want to increase the size so as to get a better look at what is happening over here okay then we have layers option through which you can just uh change the colors like these are the colors that have been taken by default but if you want some other color scheme to be there you want some other colors to be there that also you can change okay like this the divergent scales are there or the sequential scales are there too for a particular color that you can just select okay uh then we have the slice label that is what you want to be shown on the slice label right now the percentage has been shown if you want the value has to be shown as well that means what is the total number of sales that was done that you want to show and the label that means the value of the subcategory that to which subcategory it belongs that also you can select i'm just going with label and percentage not with the value part the order is sorted which means they are all sorted and if you want to show the legend or not this is the legion part you want to show it you want to hide it and then if you just hover over it then we are getting some additional information as well so that is uh controlled through this hover text value so i don't want the percentage to be shown i just want the label and the values to be shown over here because the percentage is already visible over here next we have is the chart option which you can use to set the width of the chart in pixels or in inches uh you can just select the um margins and the padding color etc the background color of the chart everything that you want you can just control from here okay so this is a custom color that i want this is the title if you want to change the title you can change it over here using lattice or using a simple text as well then we have the access option which is not been used over here next we have is the legion if you want to just change the way the legend is being shown that you can do you can just work with its size its color let me just get a black color for the legend for better visibility then we have the box if you want a box to be there on the legend the color of the border for the legion it's going to be red and the background color or if you want a different background color let's just go with this kind of color the orientation you wanted vertically or horizontally like this and the layer order of that what is the order of the layers accordingly you want that or not okay so this is where it is starting from storage all the way to fasteners okay ah then you can just close this and using the browse tool you can just run the browse tool to get a look at the chart so here it is how it is looking you can just adjust it and see that these three charts are lined one after the other now let us just render this chart using the render tool so let's just delete this browse tool for a bit go to the reporting and here we have this render in this render what i'm gonna do is just select the specific output file and save it in the form of png images three images would be created and select bulk charts or batch charts now click on save and if you just go to that location bad charts.png is what we are getting over here okay so let me just take a look at this so uh this is the kind of the image that we are getting over here and if you just zoom in these are being created like this uh in the form of a png image okay now let's see what happens if we just um store it in the form of a pdf document so for saving it i'm just going to select a pdf document here and just select batch charts as the name click on save and click on run to run the workflow so that the actual uh saving process occurs okay now let's just see how it is looking so here it is three pages have been created for the pdf each for a different category along with its legend along with its chart along with its everything so this is how we can use the render button to render the batch charts for us and that's all for this video with this we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course on alteryx as well during this course we learnt
