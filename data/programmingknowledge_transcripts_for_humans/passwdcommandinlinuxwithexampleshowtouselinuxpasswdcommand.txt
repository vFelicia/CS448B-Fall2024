With timestamps:

00:00 - now in this video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the password command okay so
00:03 - basically uh this command is basically
00:05 - we used to change the password of any
00:07 - user or if you want to add uh like
00:11 - password expiration days or anything you
00:13 - want to perform with the password any
00:15 - kind of operation like if you want to
00:17 - delete the password you want to make
00:19 - account password list then this command
00:21 - is used okay so we will basically start
00:24 - with the user creation like we will
00:26 - first of all add a user
00:28 - and then we will perform that operation
00:31 - on that particular user so I am adding
00:34 - one user here
00:36 - only one or two names allowed okay
00:40 - I'm just giving the name as
00:45 - password user
00:48 - here new password it asking me for
00:51 - I will give the new password
00:54 - okay no required these information yes
00:58 - okay clear now first of all what I will
01:01 - do I first
01:05 - login into that user
01:08 - password user
01:10 - and I will just enter the password and
01:12 - yeah here you can see I'm logged in into
01:13 - that particular user and now I will just
01:16 - exit because I want to use my account
01:19 - okay so let's start with the uh
01:25 - password
01:27 - command okay
01:29 - so now what we have to do you the
01:31 - command is basically used with the sudo
01:34 - why because only the root user or
01:37 - whatever the user who is present in the
01:40 - sudos file that that can only change the
01:42 - password or the current user if you uh
01:46 - do like this sudo and only password it
01:49 - will what it will do it will change the
01:51 - password of your current account that is
01:54 - my account that is ayush and it will ask
01:56 - me for the new password okay but I don't
01:58 - want to uh change my password okay so uh
02:02 - for a minute let's change
02:05 - so as you can see password updated
02:07 - successfully
02:08 - but again I want to keep my old password
02:13 - so I will write that password
02:24 - okay password did successfully okay so
02:27 - now moving forward what you can do if
02:29 - you want to change the password of any
02:30 - other account that is a root account
02:32 - then also you can change that how you
02:34 - can do it that is sudo
02:36 - password
02:38 - that is pass WD not a full password so
02:41 - pass WD and then the user account name
02:43 - that is root so here you can change
02:47 - the password password delete it
02:49 - successfully now what you can do you can
02:51 - just log in with that credentials using
02:53 - Su that is switch user command
02:56 - and here you will need to just uh
03:04 - okay so now here you can just enter the
03:06 - password of the root user and you will
03:08 - get the access of the root account okay
03:10 - so with this you can change the password
03:13 - of any other user and also you can do
03:15 - many operations okay so now what we will
03:17 - do we will just uh change the password
03:20 - of this the user which we had created
03:22 - now so let me close this terminal
03:26 - and I will just copy this username
03:28 - because it's so long username I had
03:30 - taken
03:31 - no problem just to sudo
03:35 - password and the name of the user that
03:37 - is a password user an enter and the new
03:39 - password I will provide him just okay
03:43 - password updated successfully so now
03:46 - what I will do I will just open up the
03:47 - new terminal and I will log in with that
03:49 - new password I know the password is not
03:51 - visible because
03:53 - the this is the feature of the Linux
03:55 - like you cannot see the password like
03:57 - it's a great thing
03:59 - okay password user user user okay it's
04:04 - not coming okay now door okay yeah so
04:08 - here you can see you have we have logged
04:10 - in with this particular account so now
04:12 - let's do some certain operations like
04:14 - now what I will do I will just close up
04:16 - this terminal and I will
04:19 - just use some some options here it's
04:23 - like a hyphen D option now we will use
04:25 - so basically what happened this option
04:27 - deletes the password and make the
04:30 - account password list
04:31 - okay so if we do like this
04:36 - password hyphen D and the username that
04:40 - is a
04:41 - password user
04:44 - and here I have to use sudo
04:49 - so password expiry information changed
04:51 - okay now what I will do I will just
04:53 - again open up the new terminal and I
04:55 - will try to login and I will check
04:57 - whether it asks me for entering the
04:59 - password or not so here you can see it
05:01 - is not asking me to enter any password
05:02 - as you can see the password user uh like
05:06 - is logged in now if I will do here who
05:08 - am I here it will show me the password
05:10 - user so using hyphen D option you can
05:13 - just make any account passwordless
05:15 - so suppose uh if you want to create a
05:18 - guest account for the like any user who
05:21 - want to use the system and you will just
05:23 - give him thumbs give him that certain
05:25 - permissions like not you will not
05:27 - provide him the root permission
05:29 - and you can create his account
05:30 - passwordless the guest account could be
05:33 - password Let's uh let it be okay it will
05:35 - not affect your system or the
05:38 - administrator
05:40 - so in this way you can just create a
05:43 - passwordless account
05:45 - now moving forward uh let me try to just
05:48 - add the password let me check what
05:50 - happens
05:51 - if I do sudo
05:55 - password password user
05:59 - I hate my asking me to enter the new
06:01 - password I am again entering and now I
06:04 - will just exit here and again I will try
06:06 - to just switch into that account
06:09 - and now it should ask me to enter the
06:12 - password and here you can see it's
06:13 - asking me to enter the password now here
06:15 - you can see I have logged in as the
06:17 - password user
06:18 - okay so in this way you can add the
06:22 - password remove the password or you can
06:24 - login into that account you using
06:26 - terminal using switch user command
06:29 - so many information you got till now
06:31 - okay now moving forward uh
06:34 - suppose if you want to like immediately
06:37 - change the password if you suppose if
06:40 - you will use hyphen e option let me
06:42 - clear the screen first
06:44 - I will use sudo password hyphen e option
06:47 - if you you will use hypheny options so
06:49 - what it option does it basically uh like
06:52 - prompt the user to change your password
06:54 - after login
06:56 - okay so let me show you just uh the
06:59 - implementation part I will just to use
07:01 - that username password user
07:04 - password expired changed and again I
07:06 - will exit and again I will try to just
07:08 - log in with this user sorry password
07:10 - user and I will just enter the password
07:13 - and it will ask me to you are required
07:15 - to change your password immediately
07:16 - administrator enforce like as I add main
07:18 - I just reinforce that particular user to
07:21 - change your password immediately
07:24 - okay you got it like Suppose there is a
07:26 - like organization in which the admin
07:28 - want to change the like admin wants like
07:32 - uh their users should change their
07:34 - password immediately okay so he can just
07:37 - add multiple users and then he will
07:40 - enforce them to change their password
07:42 - immediately okay so it will ask me to
07:44 - enter the current password and the new
07:46 - password I will write
07:48 - foreign
07:52 - characters so I have to enter the
07:54 - password which is longer than 8
07:56 - characters
08:00 - okay the password face the dictionary
08:02 - check doesn't contain enough correct
08:04 - okay no problem so but uh you got the
08:07 - point I just didn't use the strong
08:09 - password that's why it's showing like
08:10 - this but in case of you if you will
08:13 - enter the combination of the 0 and 1 and
08:15 - big capital letters small letters
08:17 - characters then that will make the
08:19 - basically a strong password
08:21 - okay so now I'm moving forward I hope
08:24 - you got this point okay but still let it
08:26 - be I will just let me show you the
08:27 - implementation otherwise you will think
08:29 - like uh
08:30 - I didn't showed you the implementation
08:32 - but again let me just do the same thing
08:35 - and I will just log in that user I will
08:39 - enter the password and current password
08:40 - it is asking me current password I will
08:43 - just enter the
08:44 - password
08:46 - some long password I will enter okay so
08:49 - it's not showing any kind of air right
08:51 - now so
08:52 - sorry again I will need to do the same
08:55 - thing
09:00 - again there is some type mistake
09:04 - it should not done yeah okay finally if
09:06 - we change the password okay now if you
09:08 - do who am I and you can see like I am
09:10 - logged in as the password user
09:13 - okay so using iPhone e option you can
09:15 - just force the particular user to change
09:18 - their password immediately after login
09:21 - okay so now moving forward uh if you
09:24 - want to add the like some number of days
09:26 - like uh minimum number of days required
09:29 - to change the password suppose you
09:31 - create a user and um like uh Suppose
09:35 - there is a organization
09:37 - and there is a intern
09:40 - okay
09:41 - in turn comes in organization
09:45 - comes in organization to do internship
09:50 - so obviously you will provide him he
09:53 - will work for some kind of 90 days or
09:55 - 120 days or any number of days he will
09:58 - work so obviously you will create their
10:00 - account and you want to automatically
10:03 - expire their account after a certain
10:04 - period of time or or you want to change
10:07 - his password after a certain period of
10:08 - time
10:09 - okay there are many number of
10:10 - requirements you can do so to do these
10:13 - kind of things we use the minimum days
10:15 - okay mean days option so it means we
10:18 - cannot change the password before 100
10:20 - days if you provide 100 in a
10:23 - you know option okay suppose the intern
10:26 - you don't want to change the password of
10:28 - intent till his journey
10:31 - suppose you're starting from 0 to 50
10:34 - days if there is intention of 50 days
10:36 - and you don't want to change the uh and
10:38 - you don't want to like in turn to change
10:40 - his password
10:42 - in this case you can use easily a hyphen
10:45 - Mendes option so let me use this option
10:48 - like it's a great thing I will use this
10:50 - password and a hyphen main days I will
10:53 - use mint days and the number of days I
10:58 - this time assuming the 50 and uh
11:02 - username
11:04 - password user I think it was the
11:06 - username yeah
11:08 - okay so there is a invited option it is
11:11 - showing me okay is there any
11:16 - okay there is no any option with hyphen
11:19 - M okay let me just try with hyphen
11:22 - iPhone Mendes maybe it should work let's
11:25 - see
11:26 - okay it's showing me permission data and
11:28 - why it's so just cleared your screen I
11:30 - have not used sudo here that starts
11:32 - showing me permission denial so sudo and
11:34 - password expired information change and
11:36 - now what I will do I will just
11:38 - not exit I will just clear the screen
11:41 - and now I'm logged in as the password
11:43 - user and I will try to change my
11:45 - password
11:46 - so whether I'm able to change or not
11:49 - let's see because I have changed the
11:51 - permission of like I cannot change my
11:53 - password
11:54 - like
11:56 - till 50 days
11:59 - okay changing password for password user
12:01 - okay but now let me just close this
12:03 - session because this is uh like you can
12:06 - say
12:07 - old session I will create a new session
12:09 - and then I will try to change the
12:11 - password
12:12 - sudo yeah sorry Su password user
12:17 - and the password what it was yeah
12:22 - I forgot yeah
12:25 - let me just increase the font size I
12:27 - will just render this password and I
12:28 - will write current password
12:33 - okay so here you can see you must wait
12:35 - longer to change your password
12:37 - okay so this is a like get a feature
12:40 - like you cannot change your password
12:43 - before 50 days okay similarly you can
12:47 - use the max days option it will just uh
12:49 - like uh
12:51 - suppose if you provide 100 days then
12:53 - after that what will happen your
12:55 - password will expire and you will need
12:58 - to obviously change that password and
13:00 - okay so what we will do we will just
13:02 - Ctrl C okay it's not working Ctrl C I
13:05 - don't know why let me just
13:06 - type like this okay
13:10 - password unchanged now what I will do I
13:12 - will just use max stress option so what
13:15 - it will do it will just uh like your
13:18 - password will get expired after this
13:20 - number of days so I will just leave it
13:22 - uh
13:24 - as
13:26 - 100
13:28 - password expiration and you your
13:31 - password will expire after 100 days okay
13:34 - and also you can use another option that
13:36 - is one days option password hyphen
13:39 - iPhone one days
13:41 - so it will warn you to change your
13:43 - password before expiry
13:45 - okay
13:48 - so permission denied you know the reason
13:51 - because we have not used sudo here
13:53 - expiry changed okay so this is the way
13:57 - to manipulate with the
14:00 - password command okay and also one more
14:03 - thing is there like inactive is also one
14:05 - option which we can use to deactivate
14:07 - account suppose after 10 days of
14:09 - expiration uh the password expires and
14:12 - uh and still you don't change the
14:14 - password in that because your account
14:15 - will get deactivated
14:17 - okay and also one more option is there
14:19 - that is password hyphen capital S and
14:22 - sudo
14:24 - and I will just provide a username hope
14:26 - it will work yeah so here it will show
14:29 - you some of the information like you can
14:31 - see the date the today's date is 39.22
14:34 - IP just shows the
14:36 - uh like uh account is locked or unlocked
14:44 - and here the date shows the creation of
14:47 - the password and the 50 is the minimum
14:49 - days and 100 is the maximum days as we
14:51 - got to know and 10 is the warning days
14:53 - you can see here okay so that's all for
14:55 - today's video guys and I hope you liked
14:57 - it and if you have any queries then you

Cleaned transcript:

now in this video we are going to learn about the password command okay so basically uh this command is basically we used to change the password of any user or if you want to add uh like password expiration days or anything you want to perform with the password any kind of operation like if you want to delete the password you want to make account password list then this command is used okay so we will basically start with the user creation like we will first of all add a user and then we will perform that operation on that particular user so I am adding one user here only one or two names allowed okay I'm just giving the name as password user here new password it asking me for I will give the new password okay no required these information yes okay clear now first of all what I will do I first login into that user password user and I will just enter the password and yeah here you can see I'm logged in into that particular user and now I will just exit because I want to use my account okay so let's start with the uh password command okay so now what we have to do you the command is basically used with the sudo why because only the root user or whatever the user who is present in the sudos file that that can only change the password or the current user if you uh do like this sudo and only password it will what it will do it will change the password of your current account that is my account that is ayush and it will ask me for the new password okay but I don't want to uh change my password okay so uh for a minute let's change so as you can see password updated successfully but again I want to keep my old password so I will write that password okay password did successfully okay so now moving forward what you can do if you want to change the password of any other account that is a root account then also you can change that how you can do it that is sudo password that is pass WD not a full password so pass WD and then the user account name that is root so here you can change the password password delete it successfully now what you can do you can just log in with that credentials using Su that is switch user command and here you will need to just uh okay so now here you can just enter the password of the root user and you will get the access of the root account okay so with this you can change the password of any other user and also you can do many operations okay so now what we will do we will just uh change the password of this the user which we had created now so let me close this terminal and I will just copy this username because it's so long username I had taken no problem just to sudo password and the name of the user that is a password user an enter and the new password I will provide him just okay password updated successfully so now what I will do I will just open up the new terminal and I will log in with that new password I know the password is not visible because the this is the feature of the Linux like you cannot see the password like it's a great thing okay password user user user okay it's not coming okay now door okay yeah so here you can see you have we have logged in with this particular account so now let's do some certain operations like now what I will do I will just close up this terminal and I will just use some some options here it's like a hyphen D option now we will use so basically what happened this option deletes the password and make the account password list okay so if we do like this password hyphen D and the username that is a password user and here I have to use sudo so password expiry information changed okay now what I will do I will just again open up the new terminal and I will try to login and I will check whether it asks me for entering the password or not so here you can see it is not asking me to enter any password as you can see the password user uh like is logged in now if I will do here who am I here it will show me the password user so using hyphen D option you can just make any account passwordless so suppose uh if you want to create a guest account for the like any user who want to use the system and you will just give him thumbs give him that certain permissions like not you will not provide him the root permission and you can create his account passwordless the guest account could be password Let's uh let it be okay it will not affect your system or the administrator so in this way you can just create a passwordless account now moving forward uh let me try to just add the password let me check what happens if I do sudo password password user I hate my asking me to enter the new password I am again entering and now I will just exit here and again I will try to just switch into that account and now it should ask me to enter the password and here you can see it's asking me to enter the password now here you can see I have logged in as the password user okay so in this way you can add the password remove the password or you can login into that account you using terminal using switch user command so many information you got till now okay now moving forward uh suppose if you want to like immediately change the password if you suppose if you will use hyphen e option let me clear the screen first I will use sudo password hyphen e option if you you will use hypheny options so what it option does it basically uh like prompt the user to change your password after login okay so let me show you just uh the implementation part I will just to use that username password user password expired changed and again I will exit and again I will try to just log in with this user sorry password user and I will just enter the password and it will ask me to you are required to change your password immediately administrator enforce like as I add main I just reinforce that particular user to change your password immediately okay you got it like Suppose there is a like organization in which the admin want to change the like admin wants like uh their users should change their password immediately okay so he can just add multiple users and then he will enforce them to change their password immediately okay so it will ask me to enter the current password and the new password I will write foreign characters so I have to enter the password which is longer than 8 characters okay the password face the dictionary check doesn't contain enough correct okay no problem so but uh you got the point I just didn't use the strong password that's why it's showing like this but in case of you if you will enter the combination of the 0 and 1 and big capital letters small letters characters then that will make the basically a strong password okay so now I'm moving forward I hope you got this point okay but still let it be I will just let me show you the implementation otherwise you will think like uh I didn't showed you the implementation but again let me just do the same thing and I will just log in that user I will enter the password and current password it is asking me current password I will just enter the password some long password I will enter okay so it's not showing any kind of air right now so sorry again I will need to do the same thing again there is some type mistake it should not done yeah okay finally if we change the password okay now if you do who am I and you can see like I am logged in as the password user okay so using iPhone e option you can just force the particular user to change their password immediately after login okay so now moving forward uh if you want to add the like some number of days like uh minimum number of days required to change the password suppose you create a user and um like uh Suppose there is a organization and there is a intern okay in turn comes in organization comes in organization to do internship so obviously you will provide him he will work for some kind of 90 days or 120 days or any number of days he will work so obviously you will create their account and you want to automatically expire their account after a certain period of time or or you want to change his password after a certain period of time okay there are many number of requirements you can do so to do these kind of things we use the minimum days okay mean days option so it means we cannot change the password before 100 days if you provide 100 in a you know option okay suppose the intern you don't want to change the password of intent till his journey suppose you're starting from 0 to 50 days if there is intention of 50 days and you don't want to change the uh and you don't want to like in turn to change his password in this case you can use easily a hyphen Mendes option so let me use this option like it's a great thing I will use this password and a hyphen main days I will use mint days and the number of days I this time assuming the 50 and uh username password user I think it was the username yeah okay so there is a invited option it is showing me okay is there any okay there is no any option with hyphen M okay let me just try with hyphen iPhone Mendes maybe it should work let's see okay it's showing me permission data and why it's so just cleared your screen I have not used sudo here that starts showing me permission denial so sudo and password expired information change and now what I will do I will just not exit I will just clear the screen and now I'm logged in as the password user and I will try to change my password so whether I'm able to change or not let's see because I have changed the permission of like I cannot change my password like till 50 days okay changing password for password user okay but now let me just close this session because this is uh like you can say old session I will create a new session and then I will try to change the password sudo yeah sorry Su password user and the password what it was yeah I forgot yeah let me just increase the font size I will just render this password and I will write current password okay so here you can see you must wait longer to change your password okay so this is a like get a feature like you cannot change your password before 50 days okay similarly you can use the max days option it will just uh like uh suppose if you provide 100 days then after that what will happen your password will expire and you will need to obviously change that password and okay so what we will do we will just Ctrl C okay it's not working Ctrl C I don't know why let me just type like this okay password unchanged now what I will do I will just use max stress option so what it will do it will just uh like your password will get expired after this number of days so I will just leave it uh as 100 password expiration and you your password will expire after 100 days okay and also you can use another option that is one days option password hyphen iPhone one days so it will warn you to change your password before expiry okay so permission denied you know the reason because we have not used sudo here expiry changed okay so this is the way to manipulate with the password command okay and also one more thing is there like inactive is also one option which we can use to deactivate account suppose after 10 days of expiration uh the password expires and uh and still you don't change the password in that because your account will get deactivated okay and also one more option is there that is password hyphen capital S and sudo and I will just provide a username hope it will work yeah so here it will show you some of the information like you can see the date the today's date is 39.22 IP just shows the uh like uh account is locked or unlocked and here the date shows the creation of the password and the 50 is the minimum days and 100 is the maximum days as we got to know and 10 is the warning days you can see here okay so that's all for today's video guys and I hope you liked it and if you have any queries then you can ask in the comment section and please just give
