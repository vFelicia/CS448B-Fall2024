00:01 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:04 - install Ubuntu version
00:07 - 16.04 on your virtual box virtual
00:10 - machine now those of you who don't know
00:14 - what is virtual box virtual box is a
00:17 - software using which you can uh run
00:21 - different type of operating system on
00:23 - your native machine so you don't need to
00:26 - uninstall anything for running an extra
00:30 - operating system on your uh host machine
00:33 - for example I have Windows machine and I
00:35 - want to install UB 2 uh on my machine I
00:39 - don't need to uninstall Windows this uh
00:42 - virtual box software will allow me
00:45 - to use Ubuntu for example as a virtual
00:50 - machine on my host machine so uh if you
00:54 - don't know how to install virtual box
00:56 - you just need to search for virtual box
00:59 - and the first language which will appear
01:00 - here will be from virtualbox.org
01:03 - and then you just need to uh go to
01:06 - downloads here you can see different
01:09 - kind of uh downloads here this is for
01:12 - Windows so you can uh just click here to
01:14 - download Virtual box and uh if you click
01:18 - here on downloads you are already uh we
01:21 - are already in downloads if you come to
01:24 - uh the you know homepage of this uh
01:27 - website then you just need to click down
01:29 - downloads from here right and then click
01:32 - uh install or download this executable
01:36 - file for virtual box and then just run
01:39 - the you know installer and uh it's not
01:43 - complicated so I'm not going to show you
01:45 - how you can download and install virtual
01:47 - box but after installing virtual box
01:50 - it's going to look like this now in my
01:53 - virtual box I already have some uh you
01:56 - know operating system running here for
01:58 - example I already have uh yuntu uh
02:01 - running on it I have Ki uh Linux uh
02:05 - installed on my virtual box or I have
02:08 - Windows 10 also on my virtual box so
02:11 - let's see how we can uh download and
02:13 - install UB 2
02:15 - 16.4 on my virtual box also right now
02:19 - whenever you uh you know see it for the
02:23 - first time you won't be uh seeing these
02:26 - virtual machine these virtual machines I
02:28 - have uh you know downloaded and
02:30 - installed after installing the V virtual
02:33 - box right now in order to uh install two
02:37 - you just need to search for Ubuntu here
02:40 - and the the first link which will appear
02:42 - here will be ubuntu.com so just uh go in
02:45 - this website and in here you will be
02:48 - able to see the desktop and you will be
02:51 - also uh able to see the downloads
02:54 - section so in here you just need to
02:56 - click downloads uh tab here and and here
03:00 - you will be able to see uh this um link
03:03 - which says open to download right so
03:06 - just click this
03:07 - link now in here you have two versions
03:11 - of open 2 AA available one is the open 2
03:15 - 16.04 at the time of making this video
03:18 - which is LTS version in here you can
03:21 - also see the full form of LTS LTS stands
03:24 - for a long-term support version right
03:27 - the other is the latest vers version of
03:30 - open 2 which is 16.10 at the time of
03:33 - making this video so whenever you come
03:35 - to this uh page you may always want to
03:40 - uh you know download the long-term uh
03:43 - support version because this LTS version
03:47 - will be supported for a long time uh on
03:50 - the other hand this version which is the
03:52 - latest version so you will be able to
03:54 - see the latest feature in this version
03:57 - but it will not be supported for a long
03:59 - time because obun 2 releases its um uh
04:03 - desktop version frequently so for for
04:07 - example in next one when you month when
04:09 - you come here it's going to be 16.11 or
04:13 - 12 or 13 whereas this version is going
04:17 - to remain uh you know stable for some
04:19 - time for some years I would say okay so
04:23 - I'm going to choose this
04:25 - 16.04 version and I will click download
04:28 - here and now you you will reach to this
04:30 - page now in here Ubuntu uh website will
04:34 - ask you to give some
04:37 - donation by the way Ubuntu is totally
04:40 - free and open source but in order to
04:44 - keep this project running it you are
04:47 - encouraged to uh you know give some
04:49 - donations but for now I don't want to
04:52 - give any donations so I will just uh
04:55 - keep these progress bar at zero so here
04:58 - my contribution will be zero but I will
05:01 - be able to see this uh button which says
05:03 - open to desktop download okay so when
05:07 - you click this button then you will be
05:10 - able to download the Open to ISO file
05:14 - now just click this button and uh you
05:16 - know download of this ioso file will
05:20 - start you see open 2 16.4.1 desktop
05:24 - 64bit version. ISO now I have already
05:28 - downloaded this file you can see this
05:30 - file is 1.4 gab so it will take some
05:34 - time to download so I have already
05:36 - downloaded this ISO file in advance so
05:39 - that I don't need to you know waste my
05:41 - time on download downloading this so I
05:44 - have already downloaded downloaded this
05:47 - once you have downloaded this ISO file
05:50 - then you will be able to see uh this ISO
05:53 - file like this so this is my ISO file
05:55 - and I have saved this ISO file at our
05:58 - desired location anywhere in your um you
06:00 - know desktop you can uh save this ISO
06:03 - file right now let's go to our virtual
06:07 - box so I will open my Virtual box and in
06:12 - here in order to create a new device
06:14 - what you can do is you can either click
06:17 - here which says new or either right
06:20 - click here on uh this um you know on on
06:24 - this left hand side then you know create
06:27 - a new device right so whenever you uh
06:31 - have already created uh a device for
06:34 - example Windows 10 and when I right
06:36 - click on this device I can even remove
06:39 - this uh Windows forever right so for a
06:42 - new device I need to just uh click here
06:45 - this button which says new which is
06:48 - going to give me this kind of uh popup
06:51 - box now in here I just need to give the
06:54 - name of my machine for
06:56 - example Ubuntu and uh this this uh
07:00 - virtual box is smart enough to give you
07:03 - these options which is Linux and uh you
07:06 - know open to 16 64bit right and maybe I
07:11 - will just give the version of this for
07:14 - example open to 0.4 because Ubuntu is
07:18 - already a name in my virtual machine you
07:20 - can see here right so Ubuntu
07:23 - 16.4 if it doesn't give you this uh type
07:26 - option you can choose it from here so
07:28 - type is Linux
07:30 - and uh the version is open to 16.4 right
07:34 - click
07:35 - next in here you just need to give the
07:37 - memory size for your virtual machine
07:40 - according to uh the size available for
07:43 - you from your host machine so for now I
07:46 - want to give it for example memory size
07:49 - of 2 GB so 20 40 right and then I will
07:56 - click uh next and in here
08:00 - uh it says do not add a virtual machine
08:03 - to hard drive so here we need to choose
08:06 - the hard drive and other option says
08:08 - create a virtual hard drive now and the
08:11 - third option says use an existing
08:14 - virtual hard drive so generally you uh
08:18 - don't want to change this option which
08:20 - is uh by default which is create a
08:23 - virtual hard drive now okay so just uh
08:26 - click this option and just click create
08:29 - which is going to give you this uh
08:31 - option which is hard drive file type so
08:35 - we want to uh create the hard drive typ
08:38 - which is vdi which sent for virtual box
08:41 - disk image right so choose the first
08:44 - option and then click next in here you
08:47 - need to uh choose the storage on the
08:50 - physical hard drive type so generally
08:53 - it's preferred to choose the dynamically
08:56 - allocated you don't want to you know
08:58 - allocate a fixed size for your virtual
09:00 - machine which is U yeah good practice I
09:04 - would say so just choose the dynamically
09:06 - allocated size and then click next now
09:10 - in here the minimum uh memory uh your
09:14 - open to will require is 8 gab now uh you
09:18 - can uh increase it for example you can
09:21 - give 30 GB or 20 GB depending upon the
09:26 - availability on your machine for example
09:28 - I will uh to uh 31 GB for example and
09:32 - then I will just create uh click create
09:36 - which is going to create this uh virtual
09:39 - machine on Virtual box now once uh you
09:43 - click create you will be able to see
09:45 - Ubuntu 16.4 virtual machine is created
09:48 - on your virtual box but still you are
09:51 - not finished so uh you may want to click
09:54 - start button to start this virtual
09:56 - machine but remember we haven't given
09:58 - any uh you know ISO file to this virtual
10:02 - machine which we have downloaded right
10:04 - so select your virtual machine which you
10:06 - have created here and then go to
10:08 - settings so just click settings here and
10:11 - in the settings you can change the name
10:14 - of your virtual machine in the future
10:15 - whenever you want or go to Advanced here
10:19 - and here you may want to uh you know
10:23 - choose these two options which will
10:24 - allow you to copy and paste between your
10:28 - Windows machine to your you know uh open
10:31 - to operating system or vice versa so
10:35 - just select B directional shared
10:37 - clipboard and bir directional drag and
10:40 - drop okay and then the other option is
10:44 - system here so system we have already
10:46 - allocated this much amount of memory so
10:49 - if you want to change it in future you
10:51 - can do it from here and for now I have
10:53 - uh one core by default allocated but I
10:56 - can increase it to two or three or for
10:59 - in future for example I want two core to
11:02 - be used for this virtual machine okay
11:05 - now in the storage just go to storage
11:08 - section and in the storage go to
11:11 - controller section and in the controller
11:13 - just click Host Drive D here in The Host
11:16 - Drive
11:17 - D you may want to go here which is a CD
11:22 - symbol here just click the CD symbol and
11:25 - then just choose the option which says
11:28 - choose a virtual CD DVD disk file okay
11:32 - so just choose uh this option from here
11:35 - and then give the location of your ISO
11:38 - file so my ISO file is uh located here
11:41 - so I will just copy the path from here
11:44 - and uh then I will paste it here and you
11:47 - can see I have this open to ISO file so
11:51 - just give the location and select your
11:54 - ISO file from here okay and then click
11:57 - open which is going to to uh provide the
12:00 - path of your ISO file so your virtual
12:02 - machine knows where to get the ISO file
12:06 - for your open to now you can just click
12:09 - okay from here and now we are ready to
12:12 - start our virtual machine so you can
12:14 - start your Virtual Machine by just right
12:16 - clicking on your virtual machine and
12:18 - clicking start or just select your
12:20 - virtual machine and then click Start
12:22 - from here so I'm going to click the
12:24 - start button now the installation
12:27 - process fortu will start so so you can
12:29 - see the open to initial window for the
12:32 - installation is going to set up and then
12:36 - we are going to see the installation
12:38 - wizard for Ubuntu inside our virtual box
12:42 - so just wait for a while it's not a very
12:45 - fast process because uh as you know
12:47 - every operating system takes some time
12:50 - to uh do its setup and everything but we
12:53 - can see here open to 16.4 installation
12:57 - has been started here right now in the
13:00 - next step I can see here my installation
13:03 - wizard for Ubuntu has been started on
13:06 - the left hand side you can choose the
13:08 - language in which you want to install
13:10 - Ubuntu I want to choose English and then
13:12 - I want to click install Ubuntu so just
13:15 - click install Ubuntu and now I can see
13:18 - this uh window which says preparing to
13:21 - install Ubuntu and uh it shows me two
13:24 - options download updates while
13:26 - installing obuntu and uh install third
13:29 - party software for graphics and Wi-Fi
13:32 - Hardware so I want to check both of
13:35 - these options here right and then I will
13:37 - click uh continue and in the next stage
13:40 - uh it ask me the installation type now
13:44 - you may be uh wondering why it's saying
13:47 - erase dis and install Ubuntu by the way
13:51 - uh if you check this option it's not
13:53 - going to erase your hard disk and
13:55 - install omuntu it's just a default
13:58 - option in
13:59 - your obuntu which uh you know says this
14:02 - so it's not going to do anything you
14:04 - just need to check this option which
14:06 - says erase disk and install auntu it's
14:09 - okay to do this it's uh just a step so
14:11 - you just need to uh you know select this
14:14 - and then click install now okay so now
14:19 - the installation process will start and
14:22 - here is the default configuration I just
14:24 - want to click continue for
14:27 - now and now you just need to choose uh
14:30 - the location according to this location
14:34 - your time uh you know will be set so for
14:37 - me it's okay for B Burling is okay so I
14:40 - will click
14:43 - continue and in here you just need to
14:45 - give the keyboard type now in every
14:48 - country uh the keyboard which you are
14:51 - using is different right so by default
14:54 - uh the US uh keyboard is uh presented to
14:58 - you but for for now in my case I'm using
15:01 - German keyboard so for this I can choose
15:05 - German keyboard layout from here so just
15:08 - uh search for uh G and I can see the
15:12 - German keyboard and I will just choose
15:15 - the German keyboard from here but if you
15:18 - want to use the same keyboard you have
15:20 - you just uh go with the default type so
15:23 - German and German and then click
15:26 - continue in your case it can be English
15:29 - us or any other
15:31 - keyboard now in here this will be the
15:35 - name of your uh you know uh your um open
15:39 - to machine so just choose some name I
15:41 - will choose uh for example code bind and
15:46 - uh this will be the username and in here
15:49 - you can uh give the computer name also
15:53 - so by default the computer name will be
15:56 - code bind I just need to give code bind
16:00 - here right so the virtual uh computer
16:03 - name will be uh whatever your name you
16:06 - have given minus code virtual machine
16:09 - right so if you don't want this long
16:11 - name you can just remove it also
16:13 - something like this okay and then you
16:16 - can give the password here give any
16:19 - secure password which you may want to
16:21 - give I'm giving my password for example
16:25 - and then repeat this password and uh
16:27 - leave everything as default and click
16:29 - continue and now the installation of uh
16:32 - Ubuntu will start now this uh step will
16:36 - take some time so now the installation
16:39 - has been started and you need to wait
16:42 - for some time to installation to
16:45 - complete so I will uh pause this video
16:48 - for some time and after everything is
16:50 - done I'm going to continue uh with this
16:53 - video okay so now as I can see uh the
16:57 - installation ofun to 16.4 has been uh
17:01 - done on my virtual box and I am seeing
17:05 - this message which says installation is
17:08 - complete you need to restart the
17:10 - computer in order to use this
17:13 - installation so when you click restart
17:15 - it's going to restart your virtual
17:17 - machine and not your computer right so
17:20 - just click restart and it's going to
17:23 - restart your obuntu virtual machine
17:26 - which you have installed right it's not
17:28 - going going to uh restart your uh
17:31 - computer and if the restart takes uh
17:34 - longer time you can uh just cancel uh
17:38 - this virtual machine also so just click
17:41 - uh this close button and then click
17:44 - power of the machine okay so if the
17:47 - restart takes a longer time just close
17:49 - the virtual machine and start it again
17:52 - so just select the virtual machine and I
17:53 - will start it again and then it's going
17:56 - to start my obuntu oper operating system
17:59 - which I have already installed right so
18:02 - I can see the operating system is
18:07 - starting and now I can see my uh open to
18:10 - operating system which is on my virtual
18:12 - box is started so you just need to give
18:15 - your password you have provided at the
18:17 - time of installation and then click
18:19 - enter which is going to you know give
18:22 - you your Ubuntu desktop okay so I will
18:27 - just wait for a few seconds and
18:29 - hopefully I will be able to see the open
18:31 - to desktop in few seconds so my desktop
18:35 - has been presented to me I can see all
18:38 - the sidebar icons here and uh here I can
18:42 - see all the you know options which
18:45 - normal Ubuntu have so I will just see
18:48 - about this computer for example and most
18:51 - probably I will be able to see the
18:54 - version of my computer here so I can see
18:58 - here it's a 64bit whatever dis size I
19:02 - have provided it's there right and uh
19:05 - the memory I have provided it's there
19:07 - the device name which I provided it's
19:09 - there okay so in this way you can
19:12 - install Ubuntu on Virtual box I hope

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install Ubuntu version 16.04 on your virtual box virtual machine now those of you who don't know what is virtual box virtual box is a software using which you can uh run different type of operating system on your native machine so you don't need to uninstall anything for running an extra operating system on your uh host machine for example I have Windows machine and I want to install UB 2 uh on my machine I don't need to uninstall Windows this uh virtual box software will allow me to use Ubuntu for example as a virtual machine on my host machine so uh if you don't know how to install virtual box you just need to search for virtual box and the first language which will appear here will be from virtualbox.org and then you just need to uh go to downloads here you can see different kind of uh downloads here this is for Windows so you can uh just click here to download Virtual box and uh if you click here on downloads you are already uh we are already in downloads if you come to uh the you know homepage of this uh website then you just need to click down downloads from here right and then click uh install or download this executable file for virtual box and then just run the you know installer and uh it's not complicated so I'm not going to show you how you can download and install virtual box but after installing virtual box it's going to look like this now in my virtual box I already have some uh you know operating system running here for example I already have uh yuntu uh running on it I have Ki uh Linux uh installed on my virtual box or I have Windows 10 also on my virtual box so let's see how we can uh download and install UB 2 16.4 on my virtual box also right now whenever you uh you know see it for the first time you won't be uh seeing these virtual machine these virtual machines I have uh you know downloaded and installed after installing the V virtual box right now in order to uh install two you just need to search for Ubuntu here and the the first link which will appear here will be ubuntu.com so just uh go in this website and in here you will be able to see the desktop and you will be also uh able to see the downloads section so in here you just need to click downloads uh tab here and and here you will be able to see uh this um link which says open to download right so just click this link now in here you have two versions of open 2 AA available one is the open 2 16.04 at the time of making this video which is LTS version in here you can also see the full form of LTS LTS stands for a longterm support version right the other is the latest vers version of open 2 which is 16.10 at the time of making this video so whenever you come to this uh page you may always want to uh you know download the longterm uh support version because this LTS version will be supported for a long time uh on the other hand this version which is the latest version so you will be able to see the latest feature in this version but it will not be supported for a long time because obun 2 releases its um uh desktop version frequently so for for example in next one when you month when you come here it's going to be 16.11 or 12 or 13 whereas this version is going to remain uh you know stable for some time for some years I would say okay so I'm going to choose this 16.04 version and I will click download here and now you you will reach to this page now in here Ubuntu uh website will ask you to give some donation by the way Ubuntu is totally free and open source but in order to keep this project running it you are encouraged to uh you know give some donations but for now I don't want to give any donations so I will just uh keep these progress bar at zero so here my contribution will be zero but I will be able to see this uh button which says open to desktop download okay so when you click this button then you will be able to download the Open to ISO file now just click this button and uh you know download of this ioso file will start you see open 2 16.4.1 desktop 64bit version. ISO now I have already downloaded this file you can see this file is 1.4 gab so it will take some time to download so I have already downloaded this ISO file in advance so that I don't need to you know waste my time on download downloading this so I have already downloaded downloaded this once you have downloaded this ISO file then you will be able to see uh this ISO file like this so this is my ISO file and I have saved this ISO file at our desired location anywhere in your um you know desktop you can uh save this ISO file right now let's go to our virtual box so I will open my Virtual box and in here in order to create a new device what you can do is you can either click here which says new or either right click here on uh this um you know on on this left hand side then you know create a new device right so whenever you uh have already created uh a device for example Windows 10 and when I right click on this device I can even remove this uh Windows forever right so for a new device I need to just uh click here this button which says new which is going to give me this kind of uh popup box now in here I just need to give the name of my machine for example Ubuntu and uh this this uh virtual box is smart enough to give you these options which is Linux and uh you know open to 16 64bit right and maybe I will just give the version of this for example open to 0.4 because Ubuntu is already a name in my virtual machine you can see here right so Ubuntu 16.4 if it doesn't give you this uh type option you can choose it from here so type is Linux and uh the version is open to 16.4 right click next in here you just need to give the memory size for your virtual machine according to uh the size available for you from your host machine so for now I want to give it for example memory size of 2 GB so 20 40 right and then I will click uh next and in here uh it says do not add a virtual machine to hard drive so here we need to choose the hard drive and other option says create a virtual hard drive now and the third option says use an existing virtual hard drive so generally you uh don't want to change this option which is uh by default which is create a virtual hard drive now okay so just uh click this option and just click create which is going to give you this uh option which is hard drive file type so we want to uh create the hard drive typ which is vdi which sent for virtual box disk image right so choose the first option and then click next in here you need to uh choose the storage on the physical hard drive type so generally it's preferred to choose the dynamically allocated you don't want to you know allocate a fixed size for your virtual machine which is U yeah good practice I would say so just choose the dynamically allocated size and then click next now in here the minimum uh memory uh your open to will require is 8 gab now uh you can uh increase it for example you can give 30 GB or 20 GB depending upon the availability on your machine for example I will uh to uh 31 GB for example and then I will just create uh click create which is going to create this uh virtual machine on Virtual box now once uh you click create you will be able to see Ubuntu 16.4 virtual machine is created on your virtual box but still you are not finished so uh you may want to click start button to start this virtual machine but remember we haven't given any uh you know ISO file to this virtual machine which we have downloaded right so select your virtual machine which you have created here and then go to settings so just click settings here and in the settings you can change the name of your virtual machine in the future whenever you want or go to Advanced here and here you may want to uh you know choose these two options which will allow you to copy and paste between your Windows machine to your you know uh open to operating system or vice versa so just select B directional shared clipboard and bir directional drag and drop okay and then the other option is system here so system we have already allocated this much amount of memory so if you want to change it in future you can do it from here and for now I have uh one core by default allocated but I can increase it to two or three or for in future for example I want two core to be used for this virtual machine okay now in the storage just go to storage section and in the storage go to controller section and in the controller just click Host Drive D here in The Host Drive D you may want to go here which is a CD symbol here just click the CD symbol and then just choose the option which says choose a virtual CD DVD disk file okay so just choose uh this option from here and then give the location of your ISO file so my ISO file is uh located here so I will just copy the path from here and uh then I will paste it here and you can see I have this open to ISO file so just give the location and select your ISO file from here okay and then click open which is going to to uh provide the path of your ISO file so your virtual machine knows where to get the ISO file for your open to now you can just click okay from here and now we are ready to start our virtual machine so you can start your Virtual Machine by just right clicking on your virtual machine and clicking start or just select your virtual machine and then click Start from here so I'm going to click the start button now the installation process fortu will start so so you can see the open to initial window for the installation is going to set up and then we are going to see the installation wizard for Ubuntu inside our virtual box so just wait for a while it's not a very fast process because uh as you know every operating system takes some time to uh do its setup and everything but we can see here open to 16.4 installation has been started here right now in the next step I can see here my installation wizard for Ubuntu has been started on the left hand side you can choose the language in which you want to install Ubuntu I want to choose English and then I want to click install Ubuntu so just click install Ubuntu and now I can see this uh window which says preparing to install Ubuntu and uh it shows me two options download updates while installing obuntu and uh install third party software for graphics and WiFi Hardware so I want to check both of these options here right and then I will click uh continue and in the next stage uh it ask me the installation type now you may be uh wondering why it's saying erase dis and install Ubuntu by the way uh if you check this option it's not going to erase your hard disk and install omuntu it's just a default option in your obuntu which uh you know says this so it's not going to do anything you just need to check this option which says erase disk and install auntu it's okay to do this it's uh just a step so you just need to uh you know select this and then click install now okay so now the installation process will start and here is the default configuration I just want to click continue for now and now you just need to choose uh the location according to this location your time uh you know will be set so for me it's okay for B Burling is okay so I will click continue and in here you just need to give the keyboard type now in every country uh the keyboard which you are using is different right so by default uh the US uh keyboard is uh presented to you but for for now in my case I'm using German keyboard so for this I can choose German keyboard layout from here so just uh search for uh G and I can see the German keyboard and I will just choose the German keyboard from here but if you want to use the same keyboard you have you just uh go with the default type so German and German and then click continue in your case it can be English us or any other keyboard now in here this will be the name of your uh you know uh your um open to machine so just choose some name I will choose uh for example code bind and uh this will be the username and in here you can uh give the computer name also so by default the computer name will be code bind I just need to give code bind here right so the virtual uh computer name will be uh whatever your name you have given minus code virtual machine right so if you don't want this long name you can just remove it also something like this okay and then you can give the password here give any secure password which you may want to give I'm giving my password for example and then repeat this password and uh leave everything as default and click continue and now the installation of uh Ubuntu will start now this uh step will take some time so now the installation has been started and you need to wait for some time to installation to complete so I will uh pause this video for some time and after everything is done I'm going to continue uh with this video okay so now as I can see uh the installation ofun to 16.4 has been uh done on my virtual box and I am seeing this message which says installation is complete you need to restart the computer in order to use this installation so when you click restart it's going to restart your virtual machine and not your computer right so just click restart and it's going to restart your obuntu virtual machine which you have installed right it's not going going to uh restart your uh computer and if the restart takes uh longer time you can uh just cancel uh this virtual machine also so just click uh this close button and then click power of the machine okay so if the restart takes a longer time just close the virtual machine and start it again so just select the virtual machine and I will start it again and then it's going to start my obuntu oper operating system which I have already installed right so I can see the operating system is starting and now I can see my uh open to operating system which is on my virtual box is started so you just need to give your password you have provided at the time of installation and then click enter which is going to you know give you your Ubuntu desktop okay so I will just wait for a few seconds and hopefully I will be able to see the open to desktop in few seconds so my desktop has been presented to me I can see all the sidebar icons here and uh here I can see all the you know options which normal Ubuntu have so I will just see about this computer for example and most probably I will be able to see the version of my computer here so I can see here it's a 64bit whatever dis size I have provided it's there right and uh the memory I have provided it's there the device name which I provided it's there okay so in this way you can install Ubuntu on Virtual box I hope You' enjoyed this video please wait comment subscribe and bye for now
