With timestamps:

00:00 - on this video we are going to start to
00:02 - post videos on networking okay like
00:05 - whatever the commands which are used in
00:06 - the networking domain in our Linux
00:08 - operating system those are the commands
00:10 - which we will learn so for basically we
00:12 - will start with the First Command that
00:14 - is the Ping command okay
00:15 - so before starting uh the Ping command I
00:18 - hope you are aware of the basics of
00:20 - networking if not then let me tell you
00:21 - about like from scratch okay
00:24 - so these are the computers uh for
00:26 - support this these are the token
00:27 - features okay
00:28 - and we are the two computers and they
00:30 - are connected to each other so now what
00:32 - happens in this case they basically form
00:33 - a kind of network what happens when
00:35 - multiple devices connected to each other
00:37 - okay so that process just called as a
00:40 - networking okay so in the networking
00:43 - there are many Concepts like uh what is
00:46 - an IP address what is the MAC address
00:48 - uh like different network topologies
00:52 - okay so we don't have to discuss that
00:53 - much thing particularly in this video so
00:56 - basically you just need about what is an
00:57 - IP address okay
00:59 - so uh let me tell you about the basics
01:01 - of IP address that you can think one of
01:05 - analogy is like
01:08 - uh what you can say just like in a
01:11 - family uh everyone has a separate name
01:14 - okay
01:15 - suppose one one name as ayush Avinash
01:19 - Ankita anything okay they are the
01:22 - siblings and they know each their names
01:23 - okay
01:24 - so similarly in our Network what happens
01:27 - each device has their own name or their
01:30 - IP address okay so basically an iPad is
01:34 - just an address which identifies a
01:36 - device on a network okay I hope that is
01:41 - a clear to you so what is an IP address
01:43 - and also there is a concept of Mac
01:45 - address
01:46 - so my encourages you can think like of
01:48 - it as a fingerprint of a person suppose
01:51 - a person changes his name or her name
01:54 - but he can't change their fingerprint
01:56 - okay it will be always same
01:59 - so that's why Mac address is just like a
02:02 - permanent writer that is like printed on
02:05 - your NIC card okay in your PC
02:09 - so now we will start with the pink
02:11 - command
02:12 - uh
02:13 - let me enter the password
02:22 - I hope there are terminally visible or
02:25 - let me increase the font size
02:27 - okay
02:30 - so now what is a ping command so ping
02:32 - command is basically a simple command
02:34 - which you basically use to uh check
02:37 - whether the our like host is reachable
02:41 - or not suppose
02:43 - I will enter google.com so what
02:45 - google.com is kind of one of the host
02:47 - okay or you can see domain name
02:50 - so I will try to check whether I am able
02:53 - to reach there or not okay
02:56 - google.com so here you can see I am
02:58 - getting multiple uh requests from them
03:02 - now I will just hit Ctrl C to stop it
03:05 - okay so here you can see this is the 64
03:07 - bytes uh like uh packet size what ah so
03:11 - now what is a packet
03:13 - okay so packet is basically just like
03:15 - your data you can
03:17 - think of it like a data that is that
03:20 - transfer suppose you send a image then
03:22 - it can it gets divided into different
03:24 - small small packets or chunks then it is
03:27 - transferred so packet is just like a you
03:30 - can think as a small data okay
03:33 - so basically what happens when you ping
03:35 - uh and when you use a ping command so it
03:39 - basically what sends the icmp Eco
03:43 - request which basically means that is
03:44 - internet control message protocol
03:47 - request okay so icmp is just a one of a
03:50 - protocol that is used by the Ping
03:52 - command okay to like for that these are
03:55 - for this purpose like for receiving or
03:59 - for sending like Eco request and Eco
04:01 - response is one of the thing which comes
04:03 - in this role okay
04:05 - so whenever it's in that is called as
04:07 - the icmp echo request and whenever it
04:10 - received and that is called as the icmp
04:12 - equal response okay so there are
04:14 - multiple attributes here you can see
04:15 - like what is this uh sequence number dtl
04:18 - okay so I will cover like most important
04:21 - things first this is from it means it is
04:24 - just and the what you can say it is just
04:27 - the IP address of this Google.com
04:30 - okay so google.com is identified by
04:35 - this IP address
04:37 - like from where this request is coming
04:39 - that is 64 bytes is coming from where so
04:42 - it is coming from this IP address this
04:45 - is maybe the domain name or something
04:46 - like that or servers maybe we don't know
04:50 - about it what is this okay
04:52 - image domain from where this is coming
04:54 - but we know that this is the IP address
04:55 - IP address of this Google.com
04:58 - this is what detail is nothing but a
05:00 - time to leave it basically means like
05:02 - how many hopes or how many routers uh
05:06 - this process has covered okay
05:08 - and time is just like uh how much time
05:11 - it took to get the response or send the
05:15 - response it basically means what
05:17 - happened the total time
05:19 - the first this is our PC this is
05:20 - google.com Okay
05:23 - so it will ask what are you there are
05:25 - you alive or not Google reply and Google
05:29 - will just reply yes I am alive okay
05:33 - so uh this is the total time that is uh
05:36 - here it is where it is uh here this one
05:39 - this is 133 millisecond okay so at what
05:42 - happens at in one second there at least
05:45 - I think four to five packets or request
05:48 - four to five request as the end
05:50 - okay so ping company we basically use
05:54 - for the like intent connectivity
05:56 - purposes further we will check about
05:58 - another Commander Trace Road ip config
06:01 - if count if config sorry we will learn
06:04 - about all those things I hope uh you
06:06 - liked this video
