00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:03 - in this video we will learn how to use
00:05 - break statement and continuous statement
00:08 - in shell scripting so let's start with
00:11 - the break statement so the break
00:14 - statement is used to exit the current
00:17 - loop before its normal execution so
00:20 - whenever we want to break out of the
00:22 - loop prematurely then we can use break
00:26 - statement so let's take an example so
00:30 - for example I have a for loop like this
00:33 - which initialize the value of I as one
00:38 - and then we are awaiting the condition
00:41 - if the value of I is less than or equal
00:44 - to ten and then here we are just
00:48 - incrementing the value so this construct
00:50 - you already know I already told you in
00:53 - the you know last videos right and then
00:56 - I simply just you know print the value
00:59 - of I and let's run the script and let's
01:02 - see what happens first of all so I'm
01:05 - going to just run the script and it
01:08 - prints one to ten which is a normal
01:11 - operation now for some reason we want to
01:16 - exit out of the loop prematurely for
01:19 - example if the value of I is greater
01:23 - than five then we want to come out of
01:26 - the loop then what we can do here is we
01:29 - can use for example if and then inside
01:34 - the if statement
01:36 - we can say if I so dollar I is greater
01:41 - than five then we want to come out of
01:45 - the loop so then and then fi for to end
01:51 - the loop and in here we just give the
01:54 - break so just write break keyword here
01:57 - and what it does is whenever the value
02:01 - of I goes greater than 5 then it this
02:08 - condition is true and the program
02:11 - institution comes here and sees
02:14 - break he would and then it comes out of
02:17 - the loop so let's see what happens now
02:19 - so let's run the script and let's see
02:23 - what happens so you can see it's
02:25 - printing this because I just need to
02:29 - give space here and once again let's run
02:33 - the script and you can see it trends 1
02:35 - to 5 here right so whenever this
02:40 - condition is true this keyword is called
02:43 - and then the program goes out of the
02:46 - loop okay so it doesn't print up to 10
02:50 - even if the you know execution of this
02:55 - for loop demands that we need to go up
02:59 - to 10 and then it goes out of the loop
03:02 - but we have given the special keyword
03:04 - break so whenever this condition is met
03:06 - then it goes out of the loop so this is
03:09 - how you can use break to come out of the
03:14 - loop or break the normal execution of
03:17 - the loop prematurely so before it's
03:20 - normal ending right now let's see how to
03:24 - use the continue statement now continue
03:29 - is a little bit different from break and
03:32 - what it does is whenever you use
03:35 - continue it skips the normal execution
03:40 - for that iteration so whatever comes
03:44 - after the continue keyword will be
03:47 - skipped and then the program will go to
03:50 - the next iteration right so let's say we
03:54 - have this condition I is equal to and
03:59 - let's say I is equal to 3 and or let's
04:04 - say we want to give the or operator here
04:08 - and let's say we say dollar i equals 6
04:14 - okay so we are just saying here that if
04:19 - I is equal to 3 or I is equal to 6 then
04:24 - we will give the continue
04:27 - key word here okay and the continue
04:30 - keyword will skip the execution of the
04:34 - loop or whenever it sees three or five
04:38 - so let's see what happens so I'm going
04:41 - to just clear the screen and run the
04:44 - script once again
04:45 - and you can see it trends one to ten but
04:49 - when we see carefully here you see one
04:53 - two but there is no three here right and
04:57 - that is what we have written here and
05:00 - then you can see four five and there is
05:03 - no six here so whenever this condition
05:07 - is met where I is equal to three or I is
05:12 - equal to six then this condition is met
05:16 - and then this keyword continue is called
05:20 - and what it means is whenever your
05:23 - program or your script sees this keyword
05:26 - in the loop then whatever comes after
05:30 - this keyword will be skipped so for
05:34 - example this echo statement comes after
05:37 - this continue keyword then this will be
05:41 - skipped and your program will go to the
05:45 - next iteration so in case of three are
05:50 - discontinued continue keyword is called
05:52 - so this will be skipped that means three
05:56 - will not be printed and then in the
06:00 - condition of for this condition is not
06:03 - match so once again this will print
06:05 - using this echo and in the case of six
06:07 - this is called and the if this is called
06:11 - everything after the continue keyword
06:15 - will be skipped so it will not print six
06:18 - and it will go to the next iteration and
06:21 - then it sees that I is equal to seven
06:24 - and it will go normally until this
06:28 - condition is met okay so this is how
06:32 - break and continue keyword works in
06:36 - shell scripting I hope you have enjoyed

hey guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in this video we will learn how to use break statement and continuous statement in shell scripting so let's start with the break statement so the break statement is used to exit the current loop before its normal execution so whenever we want to break out of the loop prematurely then we can use break statement so let's take an example so for example I have a for loop like this which initialize the value of I as one and then we are awaiting the condition if the value of I is less than or equal to ten and then here we are just incrementing the value so this construct you already know I already told you in the you know last videos right and then I simply just you know print the value of I and let's run the script and let's see what happens first of all so I'm going to just run the script and it prints one to ten which is a normal operation now for some reason we want to exit out of the loop prematurely for example if the value of I is greater than five then we want to come out of the loop then what we can do here is we can use for example if and then inside the if statement we can say if I so dollar I is greater than five then we want to come out of the loop so then and then fi for to end the loop and in here we just give the break so just write break keyword here and what it does is whenever the value of I goes greater than 5 then it this condition is true and the program institution comes here and sees break he would and then it comes out of the loop so let's see what happens now so let's run the script and let's see what happens so you can see it's printing this because I just need to give space here and once again let's run the script and you can see it trends 1 to 5 here right so whenever this condition is true this keyword is called and then the program goes out of the loop okay so it doesn't print up to 10 even if the you know execution of this for loop demands that we need to go up to 10 and then it goes out of the loop but we have given the special keyword break so whenever this condition is met then it goes out of the loop so this is how you can use break to come out of the loop or break the normal execution of the loop prematurely so before it's normal ending right now let's see how to use the continue statement now continue is a little bit different from break and what it does is whenever you use continue it skips the normal execution for that iteration so whatever comes after the continue keyword will be skipped and then the program will go to the next iteration right so let's say we have this condition I is equal to and let's say I is equal to 3 and or let's say we want to give the or operator here and let's say we say dollar i equals 6 okay so we are just saying here that if I is equal to 3 or I is equal to 6 then we will give the continue key word here okay and the continue keyword will skip the execution of the loop or whenever it sees three or five so let's see what happens so I'm going to just clear the screen and run the script once again and you can see it trends one to ten but when we see carefully here you see one two but there is no three here right and that is what we have written here and then you can see four five and there is no six here so whenever this condition is met where I is equal to three or I is equal to six then this condition is met and then this keyword continue is called and what it means is whenever your program or your script sees this keyword in the loop then whatever comes after this keyword will be skipped so for example this echo statement comes after this continue keyword then this will be skipped and your program will go to the next iteration so in case of three are discontinued continue keyword is called so this will be skipped that means three will not be printed and then in the condition of for this condition is not match so once again this will print using this echo and in the case of six this is called and the if this is called everything after the continue keyword will be skipped so it will not print six and it will go to the next iteration and then it sees that I is equal to seven and it will go normally until this condition is met okay so this is how break and continue keyword works in shell scripting I hope you have enjoyed this video please recommend subscribe and bye for now
