00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java FX tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can create our
00:08 - first Java FX application from scratch
00:11 - so let's get started I have this basic
00:15 - Barone Java class with the main method
00:20 - now to add Java FS uh support in this
00:23 - class what I need to do is first I need
00:26 - to import this Library called Java
00:30 - effect.
00:31 - application. application okay and after
00:34 - adding this uh Library what you can do
00:38 - is you can extend this class with the
00:43 - application class so extend with
00:45 - application and now this uh application
00:49 - class will ask you to implement some
00:53 - methods so you can just click this uh
00:57 - red bulb here and it will say Implement
01:01 - unimplemented method just click this and
01:04 - it's going to implement this start
01:07 - method right now to start a Java FX
01:11 - application you need to call a method
01:15 - called launch inside your main method
01:20 - okay and this launch method will call
01:23 - your Java FX application Constructor
01:27 - which in turn start your application
01:30 - okay and you have this method called
01:32 - start in which you can add your scenes
01:36 - or layouts or widgets okay so you can
01:40 - see here we have a start method with a
01:43 - argument of a stage class okay so you
01:48 - can take this uh primary stage object
01:52 - from here and then call a method called
01:56 - show okay and this is your basic Java F
02:01 - window so save your code and run it and
02:05 - this will give you this blank stage
02:09 - window okay now I have told you in the
02:13 - first video that to uh create a Java FX
02:17 - application you need to add a stage and
02:21 - inside the stage you need to add a scene
02:23 - and inside the scene you need to have
02:25 - your layout in which your widget resides
02:29 - right
02:30 - so we will do the same here so for
02:33 - example I want to add a button inside
02:35 - the stage so I will add a button by
02:39 - calling this button class and I will
02:42 - name it as BTN is equal to
02:46 - new button and to this button I can give
02:50 - an initial text inside the Constructor
02:52 - for example click me and then what I can
02:57 - do is I can create create a layout okay
03:02 - so what I'm going to do is there are
03:05 - different kind of layouts in Java FX for
03:08 - example stack pane or vertical box or
03:11 - horizontal box so we are going to create
03:14 - this layout for example I'm going to
03:16 - take one of the layout which is called
03:20 - stack Pane and I'm going to name it as
03:23 - root is equal to new stack pan and using
03:28 - this root you can call a method called
03:31 - get children's so get children and then
03:36 - you can add your button to it so just
03:39 - call a method called add and then call
03:43 - this uh button object here okay now you
03:48 - have your layout so now we are going to
03:51 - create a scene so just below this we
03:55 - will create uh scene object so scene
04:00 - scene is equal to new
04:05 - scene and then as an argument for the
04:08 - Constructor you will give your root
04:11 - object which is your layout object okay
04:15 - and now we are almost done so just take
04:18 - your stage object from here and then
04:22 - call a method called set scene here okay
04:27 - so call a method called set scene and
04:30 - then pass your scen object inside this
04:33 - method argument okay save your code and
04:37 - then run your code now you can see this
04:41 - uh small button inside this window now
04:44 - you can see here this window is very
04:48 - minimal which is of the size of this
04:51 - button now to give some size to our
04:55 - scene what we can do here is to the
04:58 - Constructor we can add two more argument
05:02 - one is the width so for example I will
05:04 - give the width as 500 and 300 as height
05:09 - save your quote and run it once again
05:12 - and now you can see your button in the
05:15 - middle and you have a sized window of
05:20 - 500 by 300 okay now to add some action
05:25 - to this button what we can do is we can
05:28 - take this uh button object and then we
05:33 - can call a method called set on action
05:40 - and as a value here you call a new event
05:44 - handler here okay and it's going to
05:48 - automatically create this uh method for
05:51 - you inside this event handler and in
05:55 - here you can perform any code for
05:58 - example printing something so for
06:00 - example I will just write sis out and I
06:04 - want to print hello world on the console
06:07 - so I will just write hello world save it
06:12 - and I will run my application once
06:14 - again and now when I press this button I
06:18 - can see this hello world is printed here
06:21 - on the console right so every time I
06:23 - press the button hello world is printed
06:27 - okay so this is how you can create your
06:29 - basic Java FX application so I hope you
06:32 - have enjoyed this video please R comment
